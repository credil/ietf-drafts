    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>
	Composite link requirements are specified in 
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-cl-requirement" />.

	A composite link framework is defined in
	<xref target="I-D.so-yong-rtgwg-cl-framework" />.
      </t>
      <t>
	Multipath techniques have been widely used in IP networks for
	over two decades.  The use of MPLS began more than a decade
	ago.  Multipath has been widely used in IP/MPLS networks for
	over a decade with very little protocol support dedicated to
	effective use of multipath.
      </t>	
      <t>
	The state of the art in multipath prior to composite links is
	documented in <xref target="multipath-bcp" />.
      </t>
      <t>
	Both Ethernet Link Aggregation <xref target="IEEE-802.1AX" />
	and MPLS link bundling <xref target="RFC4201" /> have been
	widely used in today's MPLS networks.  Composite link differs
	in the following caracteristics.
	<list style="numbers">
	  <t>
	    A composite link allows bundling of non-homogenous links
	    together as a single logical link.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    A composite link provides more information in the TE-LSDB
	    and supports more explicit control over placement of LSP.
	  </t>
	</list>
      </t>

	<t>
	  Terminology defined in

	  <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-cl-requirement" />

	  is used in this document.
	</t>

	<t>
	  In addition, the following terms are used:
	</t>

	<t>
	  <list hangIndent="4" style="hanging">
	    <t hangText="classic multipath:">
	      <vspace blankLines="0" />
	      Classic multipath refers to the most common current
	      practice in implementation and deployment of multipath
	      (see <xref target="network-operator-practices" />).  The
	      most common current practice makes use of a hash on the
	      MPLS label stack and if IPv4 or IPv6 are indicates under
	      the label stack, makes use of the IP source and
	      destination addresses <xref target="RFC4385" /> <xref
	      target="RFC4928" />.
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="classic link bundling:">
	      <vspace blankLines="0" />
	      Classic link bundling refers to the use of <xref
	      target="RFC4201" /> where the "all ones" component is
	      not used.  Where the "all ones" component is used, link
	      bundling behaves as classic multipath does.  Classic
	      link bundling selects a single component link on which
	      to put any given LSP.
	    </t>
	  </list>
	</t>

	<t>
	  Among the important distinctions between classic multipath
	  or classic link bundling and Composite Link are:
	  <list style="numbers">
	    <t>
	      Classic multipath has no provision to retain order among
	      flows within a subset of LSP.  Classic link bundling
	      retains order among all flows but as a result does a
	      poor job of splitting load among components and
	      therefore is rarely (if ever) deployed.  Composite Link
	      allows per LSP control of load split characteristics.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Classic multipath and classic link bundling do not
	      provide a means to put some LSP on component links with
	      lower delay.  Composite Link does.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Classic multipath will provide a load balance for IP and
	      LDP traffic.  Classic link bundling will not.  Neither
	      classic multipath or classic link bundling will measure
	      IP and LDP traffic and reduce the advertised "Available
	      Bandwidth" as a result of that measurement.  Composite
	      Link better supports RSVP-TE used with significant
	      traffic levels of native IP and native LDP.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Classic link bundling cannot support an LSP that is
	      greater in capacity than any single component link.
	      Classic multipath and Composite Link support this
	      capability but will reorder traffic on such an LSP.
	      Composite Link can retain order of an LSP that is
	      carried within an LSP that is greater in capacity than
	      any single component link if the contained LSP has such
	      a requirement.
	    </t>
	  </list>
	</t>

	<t>
	  None of these techniques, classic multipath, classic link
	  bundling, or Composite Link, will reorder traffic among IP
	  microflows.  None of these techniques will reorder traffic
	  among PW, if a PWE3 Control Word is used <xref
	  target="RFC4385" />.
	</t>

    <section title="Composite Link Foundation Use Cases">

      <t>
	A simple composite link composed entirely of physical links is
	illustrated in <xref target="fig.cl-links-only" />, where a
	composite link is configured between LSR1 and LSR2.  This
	composite link has three component links.  Individual
	component links in a composite link may be supported by
	different transport technologies such as wavelength, Ethernet
	VLAN.  Even if the transport technology implementing the
	component links is identical, the characteristics (e.g.,
	bandwidth, latency) of the component links may differ.
      </t>

      <t>
	 The composite link in <xref target="fig.cl-links-only" /> may
	 carry LSP traffic flows and control plane packets.  Control
	 plane packets may appear as IP packets or may be carried
	 within a generic associated channel (G-Ach) <xref
	 target="RFC5586" />. A LSP may be established over the link
	 by either RSVP-TE <xref target="RFC3209" /> or LDP <xref
	 target="RFC5036" /> signaling protocols. All component links
	 in a composite link are summarized in the same forwarding
	 adjacency LSP (FA-LSP) routing advertisement <xref
	 target="RFC3945" />.  The composite link is summarized as one
	 TE-Link advertised into the IGP by the composite link end
	 points.  This information is used in path computation when a
	 full MPLS control plane is in use.  The individual component
	 links or groups of component links may optionally be
	 advertised into the IGP as sub-TLV of the composite link
	 advertisement to indicate capacity available with various
	 characteristics, such as a delay range.

      <t>
	The three forms of component link shown in <xref
	target="fig.cl-mixed" /> are:
	<list style="numbers">
	  <t>
	    The first component link is configured with direct
	    physical media.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    The second component link is a TE tunnel that traverses
	    LSR3 and LSR4, where LSR3 and LSR4 are the nodes
	    supporting MPLS, but supporting few or no GMPLS
	    extensions.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    The third component link is formed by lower layer network
	    that has GMPLS enabled. In this case, LSR5 and LSR6 are
	    not the nodes controlled by the MPLS but provide the
	    connectivity for the component link.
	  </t>
	</list>
      </t>

      <t>
	A composite link forms one logical link between connected LSR
	and is used to carry aggregated traffic <xref
	target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-cl-requirement" />.  Composite link
	relies on its component links to carry the traffic over the
	composite link.  The endpoints of the composite link maps
	incoming traffic into component links.
      </t>

      <t>
	For example, LSR1 in <xref target="fig.cl-links-only" />
	distributes the set of traffic flows including control plane
	packets among the set of component links.  LSR2 in <xref
	target="fig.cl-links-only" /> receives the packets from its
	component links and sends them to MPLS forwarding engine with
	no attempt to reorder packets arriving on different component
	links. The traffic in the opposite direction, from LSR2 to
	LSR1, is distributed across the set of component links by the
	LSR2.
      </t>

      <t>
	These three forms of component link are only example.  Many
	other examples are possible.  A component link may itself be a
	composite link.  A segment of an LSP (single hop for that LSP)
	may be a composite link.
      </t>

    <!--  new section?  Lucy's examples ... -->

    <section anchor="cl-delay"
	     title="Delay Sensitive Applications">

      <t>
	Most applications benefit from lower delay.  Some types of
	applications are far more sensitive than others.  For example,
	real time bidirectional applications such as voice
	communication or two way video conferencing are far more
	sensitive to delay than unidirectional streaming audio or
	video.  Non-interactive bulk transfer is almost insensitive to
	delay if a large enough TCP window is used.
      </t>

      <t>
	Some applications are sensitive to delay but unwilling to pay
	extra to insure lower delay.  For example, many SIP end users
	are willing to accept the delay offerred to best effort
	services as long as call quality is good most of the time.
      </t>

      <t>
	Other applications are sensitive to delay and willing to pay
	extra to insure lower delay.  For example, financial trading
	applications are extremely sensitive to delay and with a lot
	at stake are willing to go to great lengths to reduce delay.
      </t>

      <t>
	Among the requirements of Composite Link are requirements to
	advertise capacity available within configured ranges of delay
	within a given composite link and the support the ability to
	place an LSP only on component links that meeting that LSP's
	delay requirements.
      </t>

      <t>
	The Composite Link requirements to accommodate delay sensitive
	applications are analogous to diffserv requirements to
	accomodate applications requiring higher quality of service on
	the same infrastructure as applications with less demanding
	requirements.  The ability to share capacity with less
	demanding applications, with best effort applications being
	the least demanding, can greatly reduce the cost of delivering
	service to the more demanding applications.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="cl-ip-ldp"
	     title="Large Volume of IP and LDP Traffic">

      <t>
	IP and LDP do not support traffic engineering.  Both make use
	of a shortest (lowest routing metric) path, with an option to
	use equal cost multipath (ECMP).  Note that though ECMP is
	prohibited in LDP specifications, it is widely implemented.
	Where implemented for LDP, ECMP is generally disabled by
	default for standards compliance, but often enabled in LDP
	deployments.
      </t>

      <t>
	Without traffic engineering capability, there must be
	sufficient capacity to accomodate the IP and LDP traffic.  If
	not, persistent queuing delay and loss will occur.  Unlike
	RSVP-TE, a subset of traffic cannot be routed using constraint
	based routing to avoid a congested portion of an
	infrastructure.
      </t>

      <t>
	In existing networks which accomodate IP and/or LDP with
	RSVP-TE, either the IP and LDP can be carried over RSVP-TE, or
	where the traffic contribution of IP and LDP is small, IP and
	LDP can be carried native and the effect on RSVP-TE can be
	ignored.  Ignoring the traffic contribution of IP is certainly
	valid on high capacity networks where native IP is used
	primarily for control and network management and customer IP
	is carried within RSVP-TE.
      </t>

      <t>
	Where it is desireable to carry native IP and/or LDP and IP
	and/or LDP traffic volumes are not negligible, RSVP-TE needs
	improvement.  The enhancement offerred by Composite Link is an
	ability to measure the IP and LDP, filter the measurements,
	and reduce the capacity available to RSVP-TE to avoid
	congestion.  The treatment given to the IP or LDP traffic is
	similar to the treatment when using the "auto-bandwidth"
	feature in some RSVP-TE implementations on that same traffic,
	and giving a higher priority (numerically lower setup priority
	and holding priority value) to the "auto-bandwidth" LSP.  The
	difference is that the measurement is made at each hop and the
	reduction in advertised bandwidth is made more directly.

	     title="Composite Link and Packet Ordering">

      <t>
	A strong motivation for Composite Link is the need to provide
	LSP capacity in IP backbones that exceeds the capacity of
	single wavelengths provided by transport equipment and exceeds
	the practical capacity limits acheivable through inverse
	multiplexing.  <xref target="transport-today" /> describes
	characteristics and limitations of transport systems today.
	<xref target="sect.terms" /> defines the terms "classic
	multipath" and "classic link bundling" used in this section.
      </t>

      <t>
	For purpose of discussion, consider two very large cities,
	city A and city Z.  For example, in the US high traffic cities
	might be New York and Los Angeles and in Europe high traffic
	cities might be London and Amsterdam.  Two other high volume
	cities, city B and city Y may share common provider core
	network infrastructure.  Using the same examples, the city B
	and Y may Washington DC and San Francisco or Paris and
	Stockholm.  In the US, the common infrastructure may span
	Denver, Chicago, Detroit, and Cleveland.  Other major traffic
	contributors on either US coast include Boston, northern
	Virginia on the east coast, and Seattle, and San Diego on the
	west coast.  The capacity of IP/MPLS links within the shared
	infrastructure, for example city to city links in the Denver,
	Chicago, Detroit, and Cleveland path in the US example, have
	capacities for most of the 2000s decade that greatly exceeded
	single circuits available in transport networks.
      </t>

      <t>
	For a case with four large traffic sources on either side of
	the shared infrastructure, up to sixteen core city to core
	city traffic flows in excess of transport circuit capacity may
	be accomodated on the shared infrastructure.
      </t>

      <t>
	Today the most common IP/MPLS core network design makes use of
	very large links which consist of many smaller component
	links, but use classic multipath techniques rather than
	classic link bundling or Composite Link.  A component link
	typically corresponds to the largest circuit that the
	transport system is capable of providing (or the largest cost
	effective circuit).  IP source and destination address hashing
	is used to distribute flows across the set of component links
	as described in <xref target="multipath-lag" />.
      </t>

      <t>
	Classic multipath can handle large LSP up to the total
	capacity of the multipath (within limits, see <xref
	target="multipath-active" />).  A disadvantage of classic
	multipath is the reordering among traffic within a given core
	city to core city LSP.  While there is no reordering within
	any microflow and therefore no customer visible issue, MPLS-TP
	cannot be used across an infrastructure where classic
	multipath is in use, except within pseudowires.
      </t>

      <t>
	These capacity issues force the use of classic multipath
	today.  Classic multipath excludes a direct use of MPLS-TP.
	The desire for OAM, offerred by MPLS-TP, is in conflict with
	the use of classic multipath.  There are a number of
	alternatives that satisfy both requirements.  Some
	alternatives are described below.
      </t>

      <t>
	<list style="hanging" hangIndent="4">
	  <t hangText="MPLS-TP in network edges only">
	    <vspace blankLines="1" />
	    A simple approach which requires no change to the core is
	    to disallow MPLS-TP across the core unless carried within
	    a pseudowire (PW).  MPLS-TP may be used within edge
	    domains where classic multipath is not used.  PW may be
	    signaled end to end using single segment PW (SS-PW), or
	    stitched across domains using multisegment PW (MS-PW).
	    The PW and anything carried within the PW may use OAM as
	    long as fat-PW <xref target="RFC6391" /> load splitting is
	    not used by the PW.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Composite Link at core LSP ingress/egress">
	    <vspace blankLines="1" />
	    The interior of the core network may use classic link
	    bundling, with the limitation that no LSP can exceed the
	    capacity of a single circuit.  Larger non-MPLS-TP LSP can
	    be configured using multiple ingress to egress component
	    MPLS-TP LSP.  This can be accomplished using existing IP
	    source and destination address hashing configured at LSP
	    ingress and egress, or using Composite Link configured at
	    ingress and egress.  Each component LSP, if constrained to
	    be no larger than the capacity of a single circuit.  can
	    make use of MPLS-TP and offer OAM for all top level LSP
	    across the core.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="MPLS-TP as a MPLS client">
	    <vspace blankLines="1" />
	    A third approach involves modifying the behavior of LSR in
	    the interior of the network core, such that MPLS-TP can be
	    used on a subset of LSP, where the capacity of any one LSP
	    within that MPLS-TP subset of LSP is not larger than the
	    capacity of a single circuit.  This requirement is
	    accommodated through a combination of signaling to
	    indicate LSP for which traffic splitting needs to be
	    constrained, the ability to constrain the depth of the
	    label stack over which traffic splitting can be applied on
	    a per LSP basis, and the ability to constrain the use of
	    IP addresses below the label stack for traffic splitting
	    also on a per LSP basis.
	  </t>
	</list>
      </t>

      <t>
	The above list of alternatives allow packet ordering within an
	LSP to be maintained in some circumstances and allow very
	large LSP capacities.  Each of these alternatives are
	discussed further in the following subsections.
      </t>

      <section anchor="cl-mp-classic"
	       title="MPLS-TP in network edges only">

	<t>
	  Classic MPLS link bundling is defined in <xref
	  target="RFC4201" /> and has existed since early in the 2000s
	  decade.  Classic MPLS link bundling place any given LSP
	  entirely on a single component link.  Classic MPLS link bundling is
	  not in widespread use as the means to accomodate large link
	  capacities in core networks due to the simplicity and better
	  multiplexing gain, and therefore lower network cost of
	  classic multipath.
	</t>

	<t>
	  If MPLS-TP OAM capability in the IP/MPLS network core LSP is
	  not required, then there is no need to change existing
	  network designs which use classic multipath and both label
	  stack and IP source and destination address based hashing as
	  a basis for load splitting.
	</t>

	<t>
	  If MPLS-TP is needed for a subset of LSP, then those LSP can
	  be carried within pseudowires.  The pseudowires adds a thin
	  layer of encapsulation and therefore a small overhead.  If
	  only a subset of LSP need MPLS-TP OAM, then some LSP must
	  make use of the pseudowires and other LSP avoid them.  A
	  straihtforward way to accomplish this is with administrative
	  attributes <xref target="RFC3209" />.
	</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="cl-mp-overlay"
	       title="Composite Link at core LSP ingress/egress">

	<t>
	  Composite Link can be configured only for large LSP that are
	  made of smaller MPLS-TP component LSP.  This approach is
	  capable of supporting MPLS-TP OAM over the entire set of
	  component link LSP and therefore the entire set of top level
	  LSP traversing the core.
	</t>

	<t>
	  There are two primary disadvantage of this approach.  One is
	  the number of top level LSP traversing the core can be
	  dramatically increased.  The other disadvantage is the loss
	  of multiplexing gain that results from use of classic link
	  bundling within the interior of the core network.
	</t>

	<t>
	  If component LSP use MPLS-TP, then no component LSP can
	  exceed the capacity of a single circuit.  For a given
	  composite LSP there can either be a number of equal capacity
	  component LSP or some number of full capacity component
	  links plus one LSP carrying the excess.  For example, a 350
	  Gb/s composite LSP over a 100 Gb/s infrastructure may use
	  five 70 Gb/s component LSP or three 100 Gb/s LSP plus one 50
	  Gb/s LSP.  Classic MPLS link bundling is needed to support
	  MPLS-TP and suffers from a bin packing problem even if LSP
	  traffic is completely predictable, which it never is in
	  practice.
	</t>

	<t>
	  The common means of setting composite link bandwidth
	  parameters uses long term statistical measures.  For
	  example, many providers base their LSP bandwidth parameters
	  on the 95th percentile of carried traffic as measured over a
	  one week period.  It is common to add 10-30% to the 95th
	  percentile value measured over the prior week and adjust
	  bandwidth parameters of LSP weekly.  It is also possible to
	  measure traffic flow at the LSR and adjust bandwidth
	  parameters somewhat more dynamically.  This is less common
	  in deployments and where deployed, make use of filtering to
	  track very long term trends in traffic levels.  In either
	  case, short term variation of traffic levels relative to
	  signaled LSP capacity are common.  Allowing a large
	  overallocation of LSP bandwidth parameters (ie: adding 30%
	  or more) avoids overutilization of any given LSP, but
	  increases unused network capacity and increases network
	  cost.  Allowing a small overallocation of LSP bandwidth
	  parameters (ie: 10-20% or less) results in both
	  underutilization and overutilization but statistically
	  results in a total utilization within the core that is under
	  capacity most or all of the time.
	</t>

	<t>
	  The classic multipath solution accomodates the situation in
	  which some composite LSP are underutilizing their signaled
	  capacity and others are overutilizing their capacity with
	  the need for far less unused network capacity to accomodate
	  variation in actual traffic levels.  If the actual traffic
	  levels of LSP can be described by a probability
	  distribution, the variation of the sum of LSP is less than
	  the variation of any given LSP for all but a constant
	  traffic level (where the variation of the sum and the
	  components are both zero).
	</t>

	<t>
	  There are two situations which can motivate the use of this
	  approach.  This design is favored if the provider values
	  MPLS-TP OAM across the core more than efficiency (or is
	  unaware of the efficiency issue).  This design can also make
	  sense if transport equipment or very low cost core LSR are
	  available which support only classic link bundling and
	  regardless of loss of multiplexing gain, are more cost
	  effective at carrying transit traffic than using equipment
	  which supports IP source and destination address hashing.
	</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="cl-mp-tp-client"
	       title="MPLS-TP as a MPLS client">

	<t>
	  Accomodating MPLS-TP as a MPLS client requires a small
	  change to forwarding behavior and is therefore most
	  applicable to major network overbuilds or new deployments.
	  The change to forwarding is an ability to limit the depth of
	  MPLS labels used in hashing on the label stack on a per LSP
	  basis.  Some existing hardware, particularly microprogrammed
	  hardware, may be able to accomodate this forwarding change.
	  Providing support in new hardware is not difficult, a much
	  smaller change than, for example, changes required to
	  disable PHP in an environment where LSP hierarchy is used.
	</t>

	<t>
	  The advantage of this approach is an ability to accommodate
	  MPLS-TP as a client LSP but retain the high multiplexing
	  gain and therefore efficency and low network cost of a pure
	  MPLS deployment.  The disadvantage is the need for a small
	  change in forwarding.

    <section anchor="network-operator-practices"
	     title="More Details on Existing Network Operator
	     Practices and Protocol Usage">

      <t>
	Often, network operators have a contractual Service Level
	Agreement (SLA) with customers for services that are comprised
	of numerical values for performance measures, principally
	availability, latency, delay variation.  Additionally, network
	operators may have Service Level Sepcification (SLS) that is
	for internal use by the operator. See <xref
	target="ITU-T.Y.1540" />, <xref target="ITU-T.Y.1541" />,
	<xref target="RFC3809">RFC3809, Section 4.9</xref> for
	examples of the form of such SLA and SLS specifications. In
	this document we use the term Network Performance Objective
	(NPO) as defined in section 5 of <xref target="ITU-T.Y.1541"
	/> since the SLA and SLS measures have network operator and
	service specific implications.  Note that the numerical NPO
	values of Y.1540 and Y.1541 span multiple networks and may be
	looser than network operator SLA or SLS objectives.
	Applications and acceptable user experience have an important
	relationship to these performance parameters.
      </t>

      <t>
	Consider latency as an example. In some cases, minimizing
	latency relates directly to the best customer experience
	(e.g., in TCP closer is faster). In other cases, user
	experience is relatively insensitive to latency, up to a
	specific limit at which point user perception of quality
	degrades significantly (e.g., interactive human voice and
	multimedia conferencing). A number of NPOs have. a bound on
	point-point latency, and as long as this bound is met, the NPO
	is met -- decreasing the latency is not necessary. In some
	NPOs, if the specified latency is not met, the user considers
	the service as unavailable. An unprotected LSP can be manually
	provisioned on a set of to meet this type of NPO, but this
	lowers availability since an alternate route that meets the
	latency NPO cannot be determined.
      </t>

      <t>
	Historically, when an IP/MPLS network was operated over a
	lower layer circuit switched network (e.g., SONET rings), a
	change in latency caused by the lower layer network (e.g., due
	to a maintenance action or failure) this was not known to the
	MPLS network. This resulted in latency affecting end user
	experience, sometimes violating NPOs or resulting in user
	complaints.
      </t>

      <t>
	A response to this problem was to provision IP/MPLS networks
	over unprotected circuits and set the metric and/or TE-metric
	proportional to latency. This resulted in traffic being
	directed over the least latency path, even if this was not
	needed to meet an NPO or meet user experience objectives. This
	results in reduced flexibility and increased cost for network
	operators. Using lower layer networks to provide restoration
	and grooming is expected to be more efficient, but the
	inability to communicate performance parameters, in particular
	latency, from the lower layer network to the higher layer
	network is an important problem to be solved before this can
	be done.
      </t>

      <t>
	Latency NPOs for point-to-point services are often tied
	closely to geographic locations, while latency for multipoint
	services may be based upon a worst case within a region.
      </t> 

     <t> 
       Section 7 of <xref target="ITU-T.Y.1540" /> defines
       availability for an IP service in terms of loss exceeding a
       threshold for a period on the order of 5 minutes. However, the
       timeframes for restoration (i.e., as implemented by
       pre-determined protection, convergence of routing protocols
       and/or signaling) for services range from on the order of 100
       ms or less (e.g., for VPWS to emulate classical SDH/SONET
       protection switching), to several minutes (e.g., to allow BGP
       to reconverge for L3VPN) and may differ among the set of
       customers within a single service.
     </t> 

      <t>
	The presence of only three Traffic Class (TC) bits (previously
	known as EXP bits) in the MPLS shim header is limiting when a
	network operator needs to support QoS classes for multiple
	services (e.g., L2VPN VPWS, VPLS, L3VPN and Internet), each of
	which has a set of QoS classes that need to be supported. In
	some cases one bit is used to indicate conformance to some
	ingress traffic classification, leaving only two bits for
	indicating the service QoS classes. The approach that has been
	taken is to aggregate these QoS classes into similar sets on
	LER-LSR and LSR-LSR links.
      </t>

      <t>
	Labeled LSPs and use of link layer encapsulation have been
	standardized in order to provide a means to meet these needs.
      </t>

      <t>
	The IP DSCP cannot be used for flow identification since <xref
	target="RFC4301">RFC 4301 Section 5.5</xref> requires Diffserv
	transparency, and in general network operators do not rely on
	the DSCP of Internet packets.  In addition, the use of IP DSCP
	for flow identification is incompatible with Assured
	Forwarding services <xref target="RFC2597" /> or any other
	service which may use more than one DSCP code point to carry
	traffic for a given microflow.
      </t>

      <t>
	A label is pushed onto Internet packets when they are carried
	along with L2/L3VPN packets on the same link or lower layer
	network provides a mean to distinguish between the QoS class
	for these packets.
      </t>

      <t>
	Operating an MPLS-TE network involves a different paradigm
	from operating an IGP metric-based LDP signaled MPLS
	network. The multipoint-to-point LDP signaled MPLS LSPs occur
	automatically, and balancing across parallel links occurs if
	the IGP metrics are set "equally" (with equality a locally
	definable relation).
      </t>

      <t>
	Traffic is typically comprised of a few large (some very
	large) flows and many small flows. In some cases, separate
	LSPs are established for very large flows. This can occur even
	if the IP header information is inspected by a LSR, for
	example an IPsec tunnel that carries a large amount of
	traffic. An important example of large flows is that of a
	L2/L3 VPN customer who has an access line bandwdith comparable
	to a client-client composite link bandwidth -- there could be
	flows that are on the order of the access line bandwdith.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="multipath-bcp"
	     title="Existing Multipath Standards and Techniques">

      <t>
	Today the requirement to handle large aggregations of traffic,
	much larger than a single component link, can be handled by a
	number of techniques which we will collectively call
	multipath.  Multipath applied to parallel links between the
	same set of nodes includes Ethernet Link Aggregation
	<xref target="IEEE-802.1AX" />,
	<xref target="RFC4201">link bundling</xref>, or other
	aggregation techniques some of which may be vendor specific.
	Multipath applied to diverse paths rather than parallel links
	includes Equal Cost MultiPath (ECMP) as applied to OSPF, ISIS,
	or even BGP, and equal cost LSP, as described
	in <xref target="multipath-mp" />.  Various mutilpath techniques
	have strengths and weaknesses.
      </t>

      <t>
	the term Composite Link is more general than terms such as
	Link Aggregation which is generally considered to be specific
	to Ethernet and its use here is consistent with the broad
	definition in <xref target="ITU-T.G.800" />.  The term
	multipath excludes inverse multiplexing and refers to
	techniques which only solve the problem of large aggregations

      <section anchor="multipath-common"
	       title="Common Multpath Load Spliting Techniques">

	<t>
	  Identical load balancing techniqes are used for multipath
	  both over parallel links and over diverse paths.
	</t>

	<t>
	  Large aggregates of IP traffic do not provide explicit
	  signaling to indicate the expected traffic loads.  Large
	  aggregates of MPLS traffic are carried in MPLS tunnels
	  supported by MPLS LSP.  LSP which are signaled using RSVP-TE
	  extensions do provide explicit signaling which includes the
	  expected traffic load for the aggregate.  LSP which are
	  signaled using LDP do not provide an expected traffic load.
	</t>

	<t>
	  MPLS LSP may contain other MPLS LSP arranged hierarchically.
	  When an MPLS LSR serves as a midpoint LSR in an LSP carrying
	  other LSP as payload, there is no signaling associated with
	  these inner LSP.  Therefore even when using RSVP-TE
	  signaling there may be insufficient information provided by
	  signaling to adequately distribute load based solely on
	  signaling.
	</t>

	<t>
	  Generally a set of label stack entries that is unique across
	  the ordered set of label numbers in the label stack can
	  safely be assumed to contain a group of flows.  The
	  reordering of traffic can therefore be considered to be
	  acceptable unless reordering occurs within traffic
	  containing a common unique set of label stack entries.
	  Existing load splitting techniques take advantage of this
	  property in addition to looking beyond the bottom of the
	  label stack and determining if the payload is IPv4 or IPv6
	  to load balance traffic accordingly.
	</t>

	<t>
	  MPLS-TP OAM violates the assumption that it is safe to
	  reorder traffic within an LSP.  If MPLS-TP OAM is to be
	  accommodated, then existing multipth techniques must be
	  modified.  Such modifications are outside the scope of this
	  document.
	</t>

	<t>
	  For example,a large aggregate of IP traffic may be
	  subdivided into a large number of groups of flows using a
	  hash on the IP source and destination addresses.  This is as
	  described in <xref target="RFC2475" /> and clarified in
	  <xref target="RFC3260" />.  For MPLS traffic carrying IP, a
	  similar hash can be performed on the set of labels in the
	  label stack.  These techniques are both examples of means to
	  subdivide traffic into groups of flows for the purpose of
	  load balancing traffic across aggregated link capacity.  The
	  means of identifying a set of flows should not be confused
	  with the definition of a flow.
	</t>

	<t>
	  Discussion of whether a hash based approach provides a
	  sufficiently even load balance using any particular hashing
	  algorithm or method of distributing traffic across a set of
	  component links is outside of the scope of this document.
	</t>

	<t>
	  The current load balancing techniques are referenced in
	  <xref target="RFC4385" /> and <xref target="RFC4928" />.
	  The use of three hash based approaches are described in
	  <xref target="RFC2991" /> and <xref target="RFC2992" />.  A
	  mechanism to identify flows within PW is described in
	  <xref target="RFC6391" />.  The use of hash
	  based approaches is mentioned as an example of an existing
	  set of techniques to distribute traffic over a set of
	  component links.  Other techniques are not precluded.

      <section anchor="multipath-active"
	       title="Simple and Adaptive Load Balancing Multipath">

	<t>
	  Simple multipath generally relies on the mathematical
	  probability that given a very large number of small
	  microflows, these microflows will tend to be distributed
	  evenly across a hash space.  Early very simple multipath
	  implementations assumed that all component links are of
	  equal capacity and perform a modulo operation across the
	  hashed value.  An alternate simple multipath technique uses
	  a table generally with a power of two size, and distributes
	  the table entries proportionally among component links
	  according to the capacity of each component link.
	</t>

	<t>
	  Simple load balancing works well if there are a very large
	  number of small microflows (i.e., microflow rate is much
	  less than component link capacity).  However, the case where
	  there are even a few large microflows is not handled well by
	  simple load balancing.
	</t>

	<t>
	  An adaptive load balancing multipath technique is one where
	  the traffic bound to each component link is measured and the
	  load split is adjusted accordingly.  As long as the
	  adjustment is done within a single network element, then no
	  protocol extensions are required and there are no
	  interoperability issues.
	</t>

	<t>
	  Note that if the load balancing algorithm and/or its
	  parameters is adjusted, then packets in some flows may be
	  briefly delivered out of sequence, however in practice such
	  adjustments can be made very infrequent.

	       title="Traffic Split over Parallel Links">

	<t>
	  The load spliting techniques defined in
	  <xref target="multipath-common" /> and
	  <xref target="multipath-active" /> are both used in
	  splitting traffic over parallel links between the same pair
	  of nodes.  The best known technique, though far from being
	  the first, is
	  <xref target="IEEE-802.1AX">Ethernet Link
	  Aggregation</xref>.  This same technique had been applied
	  much earlier using OSPF or ISIS Equal Cost MultiPath (ECMP)
	  over parallel links between the same
	  nodes.  <xref target="RFC1717"> Multilink PPP</xref> uses a
	  technique that provides inverse multiplexing, however a
	  number of vendors had provided proprietary extensions to
	  <xref target="RFC2615">PPP over SONET/SDH</xref> that
	  predated Ethernet Link Aggregation but are no longer used.

	<t>
	  <xref target="RFC4201">Link bundling</xref> provides yet
	  another means of handling parallel LSP.  RFC4201 explicitly
	  allow a special value of all ones to indicate a split across

	  is signaled in the MPLS RESV to indicate that the link
	  bundle is making use of classic multipath techniques.

      <section anchor="multipath-mp"
	       title="Traffic Split over Multiple Paths">

	<t>
	  OSPF or ISIS Equal Cost MultiPath (ECMP) is a well known
	  form of traffic split over multiple paths that may traverse
	  intermediate nodes.  ECMP is often incorrectly equated to
	  only this case, and multipath over multiple diverse paths is
	  often incorrectly equated to ECMP.
	</t>

	<t>
	  Many implementations are able to create more than one LSP
	  between a pair of nodes, where these LSP are routed
	  diversely to better make use of available capacity.  The
	  load on these LSP can be distributed proportionally to the
	  reserved bandwidth of the LSP.  These multiple LSP may be
	  advertised as a single PSC FA and any LSP making use of the
	  FA may be split over these multiple LSP.

    <section anchor="transport-today"
	     title="Characteristics of Transport in Core Networks">

      <t>
	The characteristics of primary interest are the capacity of a
	single circuit and the use of wave division multiplexing (WDM)
	to provide a large number of parallel circuits.
      </t>

      <t>
	Wave division multiplexing (WDM) supports multiple independent
	channels (independent ignoring crosstalk noise) at slightly
	different wavelengths of light, multiplexed onto a single
	fiber.  Typical in the early 2000s was 40 wavelengths of 10
	Gb/s capacity per wavelength.  These wavelengths are in the
	C-band range, which is about 1530-1565 nm, though some work
	has been done using the L-band 1565-1625 nm.  
      </t>

      <t>
	The C-band has been carved up using a 100 GHz spacing from
	191.7 THz to 196.1 THz by <xref target="ITU-T.G.694.2" />.
	This yields 44 channels.  If the outermost channels are not
	used, due to poorer transmission characteristics, then
	typcially 40 are used.  For practical reasons, a 50 GhZ or 25
	GHz spacing is used by more recent equipment, yielding. 80 or
	160 channels in practice.
      </t>

      <t>
	The early optical modulation techniques used within a single
	channel yielded 2.5Gb/s and 10 Gb/s capacity per channel.  As
	modulation techniques have improved 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s per
	channel have been acheived.
      </t>

      <t>
	The 40 channels of 10 Gb/s common in the mid 2000s yields a
	total of 400 Gb/s.  Tighter spacing and better modulations are
	yielding up to 8 Tb/s or more in more recent systems.
      </t>

      <t>
	Over the optical is an electrical encoding.  In the 1990s this
	was typically Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET) or
	Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH), with a maximum defined
	circuit capacity of 40 Gb/s (OC-768), though the 10 Gb/s
	OC-192 is more common.  More recently the low level electrical
	encoding has been Optical Transport Network (OTN) defined by
	ITU-T.  OTN currently defines circuit capacities up to a
	nominal 100 Gb/s (ODU4).  Both SONET/SDH and OTN make use of
	time division multiplexing (TDM) where the a higher capacity
	circuit such as a 100 Gb/s ODU4 in OTN may be subdivided into
	lower fixed capacity circuits such as ten 10 Gb/s ODU2.
      </t>

      <t>
	In the 1990s, all IP and later IP/MPLS networks either used a
	fraction of maximum circuit capacity, or at most the full
	circuit capacity toward the end of the decade, when full
	circuit capacity was 2.5 Gb/s or 10 Gb/s.  Beyond 2000, the
	TDM circuit multiplexing capability of SONET/SDH or OTN was
	rarely used.
      </t>

      <t>
	Early in the 2000s both transport equipment and core LSR
	offerred 40 Gb/s SONET OC-768.  However 10 Gb/s transport
	equipment was predominantly deployed throughout the decade,
	partially because LSR 10GbE ports were far more cost effective
	than either OC-192 or OC-768 and became practical in the
	second half of the decade.
      </t>

      <t>
	Entering the 2010 decade, LSR 40GbE and 100GbE are expected to
	become widely available and cost effective.  Slightly
	preceeding this transport equipment making use of 40 Gb/s and
	100 Gb/s modulations are becoming available.  This transport
	equipment is capable or carrying 40 Gb/s ODU3 and 100 Gb/s
	ODU4 circuits.
      </t>

      <t>
	Early in the 2000s decade IP/MPLS core networks were making
	use of single 10 Gb/s circuits.  Capacity grew quickly in the
	first half of the decade but more IP/MPLS core networks had
	only a small number of IP/MPLS links requiring 4-8 parallel 10
	Gb/s circuits.  However, the use of multipath was necessary,
	was deemed the simplest and most cost effective alternative,
	and became thoroughly entrenched.  By the end of the 2000s
	decade nearly all major IP/MPLS core service provider networks
	and a few content provider networks had IP/MPLS links which
	exceeded 100 Gb/s, long before 40GbE was available and 40 Gb/s
	transport in widespread use.
      </t>

      <t>
	It is less clear when IP/MPLS LSP exceeded 10 Gb/s, 40 Gb/s,
	and 100 Gb/s.  By 2010, many service providers have LSP in
	excess of 100 Gb/s, but few are willing to disclose how many
	LSP have reached this capacity.
      </t>

      <t>
	At the time of writing 40GbE and 100GbE LSR products are being
	evaluated by service providers and contect providers and are
	in use in network trials.  The cost of components required to
	deliver 100 GbE products remains high making these products
	less cost effective.  This is expected to change within years.
      </t>

      <t>
	The important point is that IP/MPLS core network links have
	long ago exceeded 100 Gb/s and a small number of IP/MPLS LSP
	exceed 100 Gb/s.  By the time 100 Gb/s circuits are widely
	deployed, IP/MPLS core network links are likely to exceed 1
	Tb/s and many IP/MPLS LSP capacities are likely to exceed 100
	Gb/s.  Therefore multipath techniques are likely here to stay.
