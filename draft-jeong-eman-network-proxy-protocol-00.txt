Abstract

   Climate change and cost drives all sectors of industry and society as
   a whole towards more energy-efficient technology, products and life
   styles.  The collection of Internet infrastructure and the attached
   devices are a large user of electrical energy and therefore of course
   are no exception regarding this trend.  This memo attempts to
   identify obstacles and more importantly technology options for an
   energy-efficient Internet with a focus on the protocols that are the
   product of the IETF.

1.  Introduction

   ICT sector is facing rapid growth and consuming a lot of power in
   order to provide large bandwidth and complex application services.
   According to ITU-T report, wired and wireless networks consume large
   volume of power for contents delivery.  Also the volume of CO2
   emissions caused by ICT sector is estimated 2% of total man-made
   emissions.  It is also estimated that network sector contributes to
   4% of world power consumption.  Also, the ITU-T report has analyzed
   that almost 50% of power is used due to the operation of networks
   including wireless and wired networks.  Further, the power
   consumption due to the operation of clouds and data centers shows
   approximately 23% of total power consumption.  Therefore, it is
   observed that the power consumption is higher at the access part of
   the network and the operation of data centers, and how to reduce the
   power consumption in these areas is becoming an important issue
   [ITU].

   According to recent surveys, many network equipments show a constant
   power consumption profile irrespective of their utilization level,
   i.e., energy-agnostic power profile.  Such equipments represent the
   worst case in terms of utilization and power consumption profile.  On
   the contrary, ideally, energy-aware equipments represent power
   consumption pattern proportional to their utilization or offered
   load.  Practical approaches for realizing the energy-aware equipments
   are implementing multi-stepped power profiles in order to adapt to
   the utilization level [EPC][GreenSurvey] [EEE].

   There is another researh drection for improving energy efficiency of
   network equipmnet using network proxy technology
   [I-D.winter-energy-efficient-internet][PROXZZZY] [NCP].  Network
   proxy describes technologies that maintain network connectivity for
   other devices so that these can go into low power sleep modes.  This
   mainly targets the reduction of unnecessary energy waste through edge
   devices.  ISO/IEC JTC 1 has published a proxying document [PROXZZZY].
   This specification describes an overall architecture for network
   proxying and provides capabilities that a proxy may expose to a host.
   Also, information that must be exchanged between a host and a proxy,
   and required and optional behavior of a proxy during its operation
   are described.

   It is well known that many network hosts are in active state in order
   to maintain network presence and this behavior hinders hosts from
   entering energy saving state.  Even when a node is idle with no
   running applications, background traffic is received that needs to be
   processed which inhibits the node from sleeping.  Network proxy is
   one of the possible solution for resolve this issue.  The general
   framework of network proxy was developed, but the control and

   communication mechanisms between network hosts and proxies has not
   been developed.  Thus, in order to promote the wider deployment of
   network proxy mechanism, the control and communication protocol
   should be specified.

   This document defines a control protocol for network proxy operation
   and relevant messages in order to increase energy efficiency of
   network hosts.

3.  Overview of Network Proxy

   Network proxy refers to a set of mechanisms dedicated to put network
   interfaces and networked nodes into energy saving idle mode.  Energy
   consumption in idle mode is less than active mode in general, so the
   longer the idle periods is, the higher the achievable energy saving
   can be.  Network proxy is a technology that delegates some of
   networking functions in networked nodes to other network elements
   such as external nodes or other modules in the nodes.  The network
   proxy enables network nodes to maintain network connectivity during
   idle mode.  Figure 1 shows the typical operational scenario of
   network proxy.  When a host wants to enter energy saving idle mode,
   the host delivers its network status and state to a network proxy and
   goes into idle mode.  Then, the network proxy responds to periodic
   messages on behalf of the host in idle mode.  If the proxy receives a
   message that it cannot process, it sends a wake-up message to the
   host so that the host can process the message after wake-up.

              Figure 1: Operational scenario of network proxy

   According to the survey, even though users are idle, background
   network traffic is nevertheless received and needs processing,
   preventing thus PCs from going in sleeping mode.  Also, it is known
   that most of the incoming traffic received by a PC network interface
   during otherwise idle periods can simply be dropped or does not

   require more than a minimal computation and response.  For instance,
   most broadcast frames or traffic related to port scanning may simply
   be ignored.  Usual exchanges, such as Address Resolution Protocol
   (ARP) processing, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo
   answering or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) rebinding,
   are simple tasks that could be easily performed directly by the
   network interface.  The idea behind network interface proxying
   consists in delegating the processing of such traffic.  Processing
   can imply plain filtering or may require simple responses (e.g., in
   the case of ARP, ICMP, DHCP), or even more complex task.  Such tasks
   can be delegated from the CPUs of end devices to a number of
   different elements either local elements such as low-energy processor
   onboard of the Network Interface Card (NIC) of the same device, or to
   an external element in a LAN environment [GreenSurvey].

   NIC proxy implements light processing function of the received
   packets in the NIC.  The NIC may drop the periodic protocol message
   exchange and handle the traffic requiring minimal computation, while
   the full system will be woken up only when non-trivial packets
   needing further processing are received.  The NIC proxy allows energy
   saving through power down the end hosts without losing their network
   connectivity.  According to [GreenSurvey], the NIC proxy technique
   may be applied to more than 90% of the received packets on a host
   during idle periods.

   External proxy is offloading traffic processing to an external system
   within a LAN, so that the proxy acts for a number of end-devices.  It
   can feature a more efficient CPU and thus offload the end-host from
   an even higher number of network maintenance tasks.  Delegation of
   ARP processing is a typical example of external proxy.  For example,
   a switch acts as a proxy for ARP traffic, allowing the target machine
   to sleep at least until data traffic is sent.  Energy-aware proxies
   are instead implemented in [SKILL] as a modular routers.  The authors
   implemented four different kinds of proxies, of increasing
   complexity, showing that, although the potential energy saving is
   considerable, nevertheless trivial approaches are not sufficient to
   fully exploit the potential saving.  Indeed, while broadcast traffic
   is easily filtered, a significant implementation effort is needed to
   properly handle unicast traffic.  Finally, it is noted that all the
   above work do not take into account the residential environment,
   where set-top-boxes are likely to offer opportunities for external
   proxy functionality [GreenSurvey].

   Regarding the standardization activities for network proxy, ISO/IEC
   has published ISO/IEC 16317:2011 that specifies maintenance of
   network connectivity and presence by proxies to extend the sleep
   duration of hosts.  It specifies capabilities that a proxy may expose
   to a host, information that must be exchanged between a host and a

   proxy, and required and optional behavior of a proxy while it is
   operating, including responding to packets, generating packets,
   ignoring packets, and waking the host.  However, the standard does
   not specify communication mechanisms between hosts and proxies and
   extension or modification of the referenced specifications, and
   support of security and communication protocols such as IPsec,
   MACSec, SSL, TLS, Mobile IP, etc [PROXZZZY].

   Therefore, in order to promote the wider deployment of network proxy
   mechanism, the control and communication protocol should be
   specified.

4.  Network Proxy Operation

   This section describes network proxy operation between proxy server
   and network nodes.  Figure 2 shows network proxy operations.  When a
   network node wants to enter sleep mode in order to save energy, the
   node exchanges Proxy Solicitation and Advertisement messages with
   proxy server in network.  Proxy server can be implemented as a
   function within a switch or router, or it may be implemented as a
   separate server.  Proxy Solicitation message queries to network,
   whether network proxy functionality can be supported within the
   node!_s network.  If there is a network proxy server that can provide
   proxy functionality, it replies to the node by using Proxy
   Advertisement message.

                     Figure 2: Network proxy operation

   After the proxy server discovery procedure, the node sends ICMP Sleep
   request message to Proxy Server.  The Request message contains the
   node!_s MAC address(es) and IP address(es).  After receiving the
   Sleep Confirm message from the Proxy Server, the node enters sleep
   mode.  Then the Proxy Server discards ARP Request messages sent from
   other hosts in the network.  By doing so, the node can sleep without
   receiving or processing ARP broadcast message not destined to the
   node itself.  If the Proxy Server receives an ARP request message for
   sleeping node, it sends a Wake-up packet to the sleeping node in
   order to wake it up.  During its wake-up process, Proxy Server sends

   an ARP Reply message for sleeping node.  After the sleeping node
   wakes up, it can communicate with remote hosts.  When Sleep Timer
   expires, the sleeping node wakes up and sends an ICMP Wake-up report
   message to the Proxy Server.  Then, the Proxy Server cleans up the
   state information for the sleeping node and replies with Wake-up
   confirm message.
