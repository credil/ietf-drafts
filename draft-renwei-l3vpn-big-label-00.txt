1.  Introduction

   Network virtualization and server virtualization are being designed
   and deployed in data center networks, and new data encapsulation
   methods and protocols are being defined and specified, for example,
   VXLAN, NVGRE and NVO3.  The general idea is to add a new virtual
   network header so that a physical network can be used to support
   millions (16M) of virtualized overlaid networks.  Network overlay
   virtualization have placed a new requirement on the access method to
   such virtualized overlaid networks.

   BGP/MPLS IP VPNs, as specified in RFC 2547 and RFC 4364, provide a
   market-proven technology and solution for end-to-end IP VPNs.  In BGP
   /MPLS IP VPNs, all the customer sites are connected to the service
   provider networks through PE-CE link.  It is desirable to extend the
   BGP/MPLS scheme so that customers can access their virtualized
   networks hosted in a data center by using BGP/MPLS IP VPNs.

Internet-Draft            Big Labels for L3VPN                 June 2013


   In the data plane of BGP/MPLS IP VPNs, the customer VPN/VRF instances
   are represented by an MPLS label (VPN label) locally assgined by the
   PE connecting to CE.  Since MPLS labels are 20 bits long, a PE can
   maximally support 1 million VPNs/VRFs, which are not sufficient to
   support 16 millions of virtual networks that are being standardized
   in VXLAN, NVGRE and NVO3.  When BGP/MPLS IP VPNs are extended to
   access virtualized networks in data centers, we will have to provide
   a solution on how to associate a customer to a virtual network.  This
   document will describe some use cases and specify a solution to this
   problem.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   The following terms are used in this document:

   VXLAN - Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network

2.  Use Cases and Scenarios

   In BGP/MPLS IP VPN reference models, at each site there are one or
   more Customer Edge (CE) devices, each of which is attached to one or
   more Provider Edge (PE) routers via some sort of attachment circuit
   such as PPP, Ethernet/VLAN, etc.

   When the BGP/MPLS IP VPNs reference model is extended to connect to a
   virtual network, the Customer Edge (CE) devices and Provider Edge
   (PE) devices on the data center site can be physically the same
   device: it will be both the PE device with respect to the VPN model
   and the NVE device with respect to the network virtualization, as
   illustrated in the following diagram

   -----------+           +----------------+   +----------------
              |           |                |   |
          +---+--+    +------+         +-------+--+
          |  CE  |----|  PE  |  MPLS   |  PE-NVE  | Data center
   Site 1 |device|    |device| network |  device  | virtualized

   -----------+           +----------------+   +----------------


   In addition to the VPN PE functionalities of RFC 4364, PE-NVE will
   also perform the functionalities of network overlay virtualization.
   In what follows we describe three use cases for VXLAN, NVGRE, and
   NVO3, respectively.

2.1.  VXLAN

   In this use case, the VXLAN protocol of [I-D.mahalingam-dutt-dcops-
   vxlan] is used for network overlay virtualiztion.

      L3VPN-VXLAN Interworking Functions: It maintains the mapping
      information between L3VPN label and VXLAN Network Identifier
      (VNI).  This mapping information is used to receive packets from
      the MPLS network and forward them to the VXLAN network, and
      receive packets from the VXLAN network and forward them to the
      MPLS network

   In order to correctly provide one-one mapping between VPN labels and
   VNI, we need to extend the MPLS label space to have at least 16
   million labels.

2.2.  NVGRE

   In this use case, the NVGRE protocol of [I-D.sridharan-
   virtualization-nvgre] is used for network overlay virtualiztion.

   When one PC in a CE site wants to send a packet to one VM in the data
   center, the outgoing packet headers of PE device and PE-NVE device
   are described as above.  VPN label is mapped to VSID in NVGRE Header.

   The Provider Edge device connecting to the virtual networks will
   perform the following functionalities:

      VPN PE functions: (1) It uses BGP to distribute VPN routes; (2) It
      maintains VRFs; (3) It uses MPLS to receive and forward packets
      from and to the MPLS network.

      NVGRE Endpoint functions: It originates and terminates NVGRE
      packets; (2) It maintains the NVGRE Virtual Subnet Identifier
      (VSID) for NVGRE

      L3VPN-NVGRE Interworking Functions: It maintains the mapping
      information between L3VPN label and NVGRE Virtual Subnet
      Identifier (VSID).  This mapping information is used to receive
      packets from the MPLS network and forward them to the NVGRE
      virtual network, and receive packets from the NVGRE virtual
      network and forward them to the MPLS network

   In order to correctly provide one-one mapping between VPN labels and
   VSID, we need to extend the MPLS label space to have at least 16
   million labels.

2.3.  NVO3

   NVO3 is an on-going effort to standardize solutions to data center
   virtualizaiton with the goal of providing viable data encapsulation
   and protocols across a scaling range of a few thousand VMs to several
   million VMs running on greater than one hundred thousand physical
   servers.  NVO3 considers approaches to multi-tenancy that reside at
   the network layer rather than using traditional isolation mechanisms
   that rely on the underlying layer 2 technology (e.g. VLANs).

   Based on NVO3 framework and problem statement, NVO3 will deliver 16
   million virtual networks in a physical data center.  If L3VPN is used
   to access the virtual networks inside the data center, we need to
   solve the problem of associating MPLS labels to NVO3 VNIDs.

3.  Big Labels

   A PE device uses VPN labels to find the associated VRFs for VPN
   packet forwarding.  Since there are potentially 16 millions of
   virtual networks, 20 bits label are not sufficient; we need to
   specify a new type of labels: big labels.  A big label is an
   extension to the MPLS label format of RFC 3032 so that the label
   space is bigger than the 20-bit space with the minimum of 16 millions
   of labels.

   The exact big label format is described in [I-D.draft-renwei-mpls-
   big-label].  One option of the big label format is as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |            Big Label Indicator        | Exp |S|       TTL     |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |            Big Label Value                                    |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                       Exp:    Experimental Use, 3 bits

Internet-Draft            Big Labels for L3VPN                 June 2013


                       S:      Bottom of Stack, 1 bit
                       TTL:    Time to Live, 8 bits


   The Big Label Indicator is a reserved MPLS label.  The currently
   unassigned reserved label range is 4-6 and 8-12.  We will temporarily
   use label 8 for big label indicator, but the final value will be
   assigned by IANA.  The Big Label Value is a 32-bit value.

   When an MPLS LSR receivs an MPLS packet, it reads out the MPLS label.
   If the MPLS label is a Big Label Indicator, it will use the
   subsequent 32-bit value as the MPLS label for the forwarding purpose.

4.  VRFs

   In BGP/MPLS L3VPN models, A VRF on each PE is associated to a local
   attachment circuit connected to a customer site and routing targets
   connected to remote sites.  When BGP/MPLS L3VPN model is extended to
   connect a virtulized network, A VRF on each PE-NVE device is
   associated to a virtual network instance which is significant locally
   to the virtualized networks in the data center.

   Except for big labels being used, there are no changes to VRFs.  In
   particular, the operational procedure is the same as common label-
   based VRFs.

5.  VPN Route Distribution

   VPN route distribution is performed by BGP in the same way as in RFC
   2547 except that the labels associated to VRFs are "big labels".  The
   detailed changes to BGP protocols are described in [I-D.draft-renwei-
   mpls-bgp-big-label].

6.  IANA Considerations

   The requirements on IANA are specified in other related documents
   [I-D.draft-renwei-mpls-big-label] and [I-D.draft-renwei-mpls-bgp-big-
   label], which request a reserved label to represent Big Label
   Indicator and BGP capabilities for big labels.

7.  Security Considerations

   This draft does not add any additional security implications to the
   BGP/MPLS IP VPNs.  All existing authentication and security
   mechanisms for BGP and MPLS still apply.
