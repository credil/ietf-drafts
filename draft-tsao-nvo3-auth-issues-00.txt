1.  Introduction and All

   IETF is developing technologies to use the overlay networks to
   support large scale virtual data centers.  [I-D.ietf-nvo3-framework]
   provides a framework for Network Virtualization over L3 (NVO3), and
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-overlay-problem-statement] summarizes the problems of
   the virtual data centers using layer-3 overlay technologies.  Network
   virtualization overlay in data centers essentially supports features
   of truely virtualization and separation of virtual networking from
   the physical devices.  Virtual networking for a tenant is completely
   decoupled from DC physical network in terms of configuration, address
   allocation, location, mobility, etc.

   This short document tries to initiate the discussion about the
   authentication issues in the virtualized data centers.  Although the
   issue has not been mentioned in the problem statement document, we
   believe this issue is necessary for the audience to look into.

   The tenant in virtual data centers is a variant.  Its capacity and
   size, as well as its configuration may vary from time to time.  When
   the tenant owner plans to increase its network capacity and rent more
   end-devices (could be both physical servers or virtual machines, or
   contol devices such as firewall, security gateway), the tenant system
   MUST be able to authenticate and authorize the new end device so that
   the new devices can be integrated into the existing infrastructure.

   The problems are listed as below.

   1.  Network-layer authentication.  Service layer authentication by
       using user account is not an ideal way, due to the lack of fine-
       grained layer-3 traffic control.  Network-layer authentication is
       necessary to employ more accurate control of the devices and
       flows in a tenant system.  The newly added device can only get
       the layer-3 connectivity after a successful authentication.  This
       way prevents many known attacks.

   2.  Access control.  Before authentication, the newly added end-
       device can have necessary control plane communication with the
       centralized or distributed authentication control servers.  After
       authentication, the data communication capability is enabled.
       The Network Virtualization Edge (NVE) should be able to
       distinguish authenticated devices and un-authenticated devices
       based on their network or lower layer identities.

   3.  Routing of authentication traffic.  The intermediate device
       should be able to route the authentication request to the correct
       authentication server.  In a virtualized data center, the ID and
       overlay make this problem complex.

   4.  Secure service discovery.  Service discovery is normally
       broadcast or multicast in the domain.  In virtual data centers,
       to avoid the flooding of traffics in both the physical network
       and virtual network, the broadcast domain design should be kept
       intact and smart.  Server discovery process MUST also be able to
       filter out the invalid reply from unrelated repository.


2.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not have any IANA requests.


3.  Security Considerations

   This document analyzes the authentication issues in virtual overlay
   data centers, and does not introduce any new security issues to the
   problem space.
