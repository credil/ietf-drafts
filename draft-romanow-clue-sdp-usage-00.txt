Internet-Draft             SDP Usage for CLUE                 March 2012


1.  Introduction

   This draft discusses how SDP can be used to carry CLUE, ControLling
   mUltiple streams for tElepresence, encoding and encoding group
   descriptions.  CLUE specifies how multiple streams can be
   communicated in a telepresence conference in a standardized manner
   allowing interoperability.  This draft assumes a familiarity with the
   CLUE framework document and the concepts defined therein [CLUEFRWK].
   The media provider describes to the media consumer both media
   captures and encodings that it is capable of sending, and the
   consumer "configures" the provider to send the captures using the
   potential streams it wants to receive.  In order for an interactive
   telepresence session to be established between A and B, each party
   needs to configure its role as both a media provider and a media
   consumer.

   Encoding parameters are maxBandwidth, maxMbps, maxFps, maxWidth,
   maxHeight.  Encoding group parameters are maxGroupBandwidth and
   maxGroupVideoMbps.

   This draft investigates how SDP can be used to carry CLUE provider
   advertisement encodings and encoding groups.  This was investigated
   because it was suggested that there are two reasons for using SDP for
   encoding and encoding group parameters:

   1.  By carrying the encoding and encoding group parameters in SDP,
       the call-control agents, proxies, and other intermediaries can
       monitor and potentially modify these values thereby allowing
       administrators to easily configure and enforce either static
       limitations or more dynamic call-shaping approaches.
   2.  SDP is the usual protocol for communicating the encoding and
       encoding group parameters in SIP-based systems

   As specified in the CLUE framework, parties in a telepresence
   conference do not negotiate a single value between them, therefore
   offer answer is not used for the full negotiation of encoding values.
   Rather, we propose, the consumer uses another mechanism, such as a
   new CLUE protocol, to select which captures it wants and how it wants
   them encoded.  Capture attributes such as spatial relations would
   also be communicated in a CLUE protocol, rather than in SDP, since
   they are not media descriptions of the streams.  In this approach,
   the CLUE protocol would then carry the information related to media
   captures, as well as implement the control functions described in the
   CLUE framework including configuring the encodings.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.


3.  Background

   The following abstractions defined in the CLUE framework document
   need to be understood in considering this investigation.

   o  Media capture - fundamental representation of the content, audio
      and video so far defined.  Each media capture is associated with
      an encoding group.
   o  Capture set - A capture set is most usefully thought of as being a
      set of table rows, with each row consisting of a set of media
      captures.  Media captures within a row can always be used
      simultaneously, whereas media captures in different sets may or
      may not be used simultaneously..  By including multiple media
      captures in a row within a capture set, the provider is signalling
      that those captures together form a representation of that capture
      set's scene.
   o  Simultaneous transmission set - there are often physical
      constraints that determine whether captures can be sent at the
      same time or not.  For example, a camera may be able to create a
      video capture which is close up and another which is zoomed out.
      These 2 views cannot be done simultaneously.  The simultaneous
      transmission set expresses the physical constraints on
      simultaneity.
   o  Encoding - Represents a way to encode a media capture in terms of
      its associated media characteristics, specifically maxBandwidth,
      maxFps, maxMbps, maxHeight and maxWidth.  Each encoding is
      uniquely identified within an encoding group.  [Practically it's
      desirable to have a unique ID among all encodings in the
      conference]
   o  Encoding group - An encoding group includes a set of one or more
      individual encodings, plus parameters that apply to the group as a
      whole, specifically maxGroupBandwidth and maxGroupMpbs.  Each
      encoding group has a unique identifier in the SDP.


4.  Assumptions

   o  For each CLUE type ("purpose") of media capture (audio, video-
      main, or video-presentation), there will be at most one
      corresponding SDP media stream ("m=" line).  Note: video-main and

Internet-Draft             SDP Usage for CLUE                 March 2012


      video-presentation are both using "video" media type.
   o  Multiple media captures of the same type, or different encodings
      of a given media capture will all use the same SDP media stream
      (e.g. via RTP multiplexing with a different SSRC for each).
   o  It is acceptable to use more than one offer/answer exchanges to
      setup the whole Telepresence session.
   o  The Telepresence session is established by setting up sets of
      unidirectional streams (not bidirectional streams).


5.  Encoding

   The CLUE framework calls an RTP stream that the provider is capable
   of sending, an Encoding.  The parameters of an encoding are:
   encodingID, maxBandwidth, maxMbps, maxWidth, maxHeight, maxFrameRate,
   as described below in the following tables, one shows video Figure 1
   and the other shows audio Figure 2.


   +-----------------+-------------------------------------------------+
   | Name            | Description
   +-----------------+-------------------------------------------------+
   | encodingID      | A unique identifier for the individual encoding |
   | maxBandwidth    | Maximum number of bits per second               |
   | maxMbps         | Maximum number of macroblocks per second:       |
   |       ((width  + 15) / 16) * ((height + 15) / 16) * framesPerSecond
   | maxWidth        |Video resolution's max supported width, in pixels|
   | maxHeight       |Video resolution's max supported height, in pixels
   | maxFrameRate    | Maximum supported frame rate                    |
   +--------------------+----------------------------------------------+

6.  Encoding group

   In addition, the Framework defines an Encoding Group as a set of
   individual encodings plus parameters that apply to the whole set, as
   shown in Table xx.  The two parameters for the group of encodings are
   maxGroupBandwidth and maxGroupVideoMbps.  Max group bandwidth refers
   to both audio and video, and is the maximum value of the sum of all
   of the configured bitrates.  The max group video macroblocks per
   second refers only to video and is the maximum value for the sum of
   all the macroblocks per second in the encoding group.  This is shown
   in Figure 3


   +------------------+------------------------------------------------+
   | Name             | Description                                    |
   +------------------+------------------------------------------------+
   | maxGroupBandwidth| Max # bits per sec for all encodings combined  |
   | maxGroupVideoMbps| Max # macroblks/sec all video encodings combined
   | videoEncodings[] | Set of potential encodings (list of encodingIDs)
   | audioEncodings[] | Set of potential encodings (list of encodingIDs)
   +------------------+------------------------------------------------+


                    Figure 3: Encoding group parameters

   Additional characteristics of encoding groups include:

   1.  A media provider advertises one or more encoding groups.
   2.  Each encoding group includes one or more individual encodings.
   3.  Each individual encoding can represent a different way of
       encoding media.  For example one individual encoding may be
       1080p60 video, another could be 720p30, with a third being CIF.
   4.  While a typical 3 codec/display system might have one encoding
       group per "codec box", there are many possibilities for the
       number of encoding groups a provider may be able to offer and for
       the encoding values in each encoding group.  The consumer uses
       the media capture attribute EncGroupID to know which set of
       encodings to consider using for that capture and what the
       constraints are.
   5.  In a provider advertisement, the sum of the maxBandwidths of the
       encodings advertised in an encoding group may total more than the
       maxGroupBandwidth, as these are potential encodings.  Similarly
       for maxGroupVideoMbps.
   6.  In a consumer request, the sum of the maxBandwidths of the
       encodings selected in an encoding group may total more than the
       maxGroupBandwidth.  However the provider will send values under
       the max of the individual encodings and which sum to a total
       below or equal to that of the group max.

   The following diagram Figure 4, Association of captures and
   encodings, depicts the association between the encodings (expressed
   in SDP) and the media captures, expressed in elsewhere (in a CLUE
   protocol perhaps).  In this diagram the consumer can match Capture 1
   with any of the encodings in Encoding group 1.

   The consumer can match capture 2 with any of the encodings in
   encoding group 2.  Although this illustrates only capture 1 in
   capture set 1, there would likely be more than one capture. /*change
   this illustration to add more captures so it doesn't look like 1 goes
   to encgrp 1 and capture 2 goes to encgrp 2. */

   | +----------------+--------------- Encoding 1   }
   | | capture 1      | |------------- Encoding 2   } Encoding group 1
   | | video          | |------------- Encoding 3   }

   | | encgrpID 1     | |

   | | capture 2      | |

   |                    |
   +--------------------+


              Figure 4: Association of captures and encodings

   In this example showing a capture set containing 2 captures, the
   first captureID 1 is video and is mapped to encoding group 1,
   encgrpID 1.  The consumer can map capture 1 to any or all of the
   potential RTP streams within encoding group 1.  The use case for
   mapping a capture to more than one encoding is simulcast.  The
   information contained in the encoding group parameters helps the
   consumer choose how to do this mapping by communicating the resource
   limitations.

7.  Solution overview

   In the CLUE framework, each party in the conference is usually both
   provider and consumer.  Each party needs to advertise its provider
   encoding parameter values to the other side.  It is not the typical
   communication model for SDP offer answer, which is more often a
   bidirectional agreement on parameter values.  Today telepresence
   endpoints actively negotiate audio and video SDP media streams using
   the SDP offer/answer model during call establishment and during
   midcall features, such as hold resume.

   For example, if A and B are endpoints or middle boxes in a
   telepresence conference, A is a provider for B. We propose that A
   send capture information to B through a CLUE protocol and stream
   information through SDP.  As a consumer, B responds to A also through
   a CLUE protocol.  B chooses which captures it wants "configured" on
   which offered streams.

   This process is carried out at call setup and also throughout the
   conference whenever there is a change in the captures or streams that
   the provider is capable of sending, or if there is a change in which
   captures and streams the receiver wants to receive.

   One possibility for handling provider advertisements of encodings in
   SDP is for one party to do provider advertisement as the SDP offer
   and the other party to answer with its provider advertisement.  A
   sends the offer with encoding advertisements.  B responds to A's
   offer in SDP as a provider, sending B's media stream capabilities as
   an SDP answer.  B then sends its capture information to A through the
   CLUE protocol.

   [Editor's NOTE: There are other approaches than the one described
   here, which we will explore in the next version.]

   The following diagram, Figure 6, Initial offer answer exchange,
   depicts an end-end call with the message sequence, where Alice is the
   provider and Bob is the consumer.  Normally, Bob is also a provider
   and Alice is a consumer (whether it is a point to point or multipoint
   call).

8.  Proposal for advertising Encoding and Encoding groups in SDP

   The following depicts the exchange of CLUE capabilities between two
   endpoints or MCUs in the initial offer/answer exchange of SDP.  A and
   B are each both provider and consumer.  First A sends provider
   information.  B responds with its encoding provider information.

                  Figure 6: Initial offer answer exchange

   The challenge with a bidirectional approach is that the answerer must
   not respond with a type that was not in the offer.  Suppose A offers
   two SDP media streams video main and audio.  B however wants to offer
   3 SDP media streams - video main, audio and video presentation.  B
   cannot add a new stream type in the answer.

   One way around this is to make an agreement that each party offers
   all media types whether it will send them or not.  This allows both
   sides to offer any media type.  An adjustment to reflect the real
   situation is made in a later offer answer.  Using the example above,
   A will only send video main and audio, however, following the
   specification, A offers all 3 audio, video main, video presentation.
   B is going to send presentation, B also offers all 3 audio, video
   main and video presentation.  The CLUE protocol negotiations take
   place.  Then there is an updated offer in which A does not offer
   video presentation, thus making the SDP media streams accurate.


9.  Representation of Encoding and Encoding group in SDP

   We want a mechanism that will allow the provider to advertise
   encodings and encoding groups.  We can define three new SDP
   attributes: clue, enc, encgrp.

   Encgrp is the encoding group.  It consists of a an encoding group ID,
   a list of encodings, and a list of encoding group parameters,
   maxGroupBandwidth, maxGroupVideoMbps.


   a=encgrp:<encgrp-number> <list of enc nums> <list of group params>


   Enc is the encoding.  It consists of an encoding id and a list of
   clue parameters and their values for the encoding.


   a=enc: <enc-number> <list of clue nums>


   Clue consists of CLUE encoding parameters: max-fps, max-mbps, max-
   bitrate, imageattr.  The parameter list can be extended in the
   future.


   a=clue:<clue-number> <clue attribute=value>

Internet-Draft             SDP Usage for CLUE                 March 2012


   where clue attributes in our context would be "imageattr[x= ,y= ]"
   [draft-ietf-mmusic-image-attributes],"max-mbps", "max-br", max-fps



   Example of 2 video encodings:

   a=clue:1 imageattr[w=1920, y=1088]
   a=clue:2 max-fps=60
   a=clue:3 max-mbps=244800
   a=clue:4 max-br=4000
   a=clue:5 imageattr[x=960, y=554]
   a=clue:6 max-fps=30
   a=clue:7 max-mbps=61200

   a=enc:1 clue=1,2,3,4          Encoding 1 and its clue attributes
   a=enc:2 clue=5,6,7,4          Encoding  2 and its clue attributes
   Example of 2 video encoding groups
   a=encgrp: 1 enc=1,2,3 grpparm=3,4,5
   a=encgrp:2 enc=4,5,6,7 grpparm=2,4,5

10.  Concerns about conveying CLUE parameters via SDP

   There are a several concerns in using SDP for CLUE provider
   capability announcements.  Passing information to two separate
   protocols and parsing it from them complicates the protocol and
   implementation.  Secondly, if the two SIP peers do not communicate
   directly (e.g. due to SIP Record-Route), then reINVITEs/UPDATEs may
   be delay-prone compared to an independent and direct end-to-end
   protocol; this is relatively unimportant so long as any parameters
   expected to change repeatedly, or that must be sent when a stream
   switches, are kept out of the SDP.

   The media information will potentially be large and significantly
   expand the SDP size.  Further work and testing will be required to
   see if it is a problem in practice, and whether it is inherent to
   CLUE to begin with.

   The presence of the CLUE protocol negotiation provides a way to
   ameliorate this problem for systems operating in a mixed CLUE/
   non-CLUE environment that don't wish to send the information to non-
   CLUE endpoints: the initial offer contains the CLUE protocol m-line,
   but not the CLUE media descriptions.  The answerer sees that the
   caller is CLUE-capable and includes the media description in their



Romanow, et al.         Expires September 6, 2012              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft             SDP Usage for CLUE                 March 2012


   answer, and the offerer can then reINVITE once negotiation is
   complete with a media description.

   The value to the intermediaries of the encoding parameters needs to
   be considered carefully.  The intermediaries will have the TIAS value
   which is updated after CLUE protocol activity.  What about the
   encoding parameters?  We feel they are unlikely to be of much use to
   intermediaries - they are the potential maximum values of potential
   RTP streams.  Of what value would they be?

   It seems the encoding group parameter values, especially the
   maxGroupBandwidth could be of interest to intermediaries augmenting
   the TIAS information.  An alternative to including provider
   advertisements in SDP might be to include an attribute in SDP for the
   sum of all the Encoding group maxGroupBandwidths, which seems more
   valuable than all the individual encoding group maxGroupBandwidths.

   Another factor to consider is that suppose an intermediary changes
   the maxGroupBandwidth value - that change would be seen by the
   Consumer, not by the provider, and it is the provider who is the one
   who needs to see a change in encoding group available resources.

   Note on real time requirements: The provider advertisements and
   Consumer selection should be as quick as possible, but do not have
   hard real time requirements.  They can be accomplished within the
   time scale of signaling.

   There is however one scenario that has timing requirements more
   stringent than signaling typically provides.  Consider a switch=true
   audio capture, the information on the spatial location of the audio
   capture needs to happen in real time.  The speaker changes frequently
   and the location of the speaker must be known quickly (in real time)
   in order to assign the incoming stream to a decoder.
