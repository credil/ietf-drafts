      <t>This specification defines a “safe” HTTP Client Hint, expressing a user
preference to avoid “objectionable” content.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>Many Web sites have a “safe” mode, to assist those who don’t want to be
exposed to “objectionable” content, or who don’t want their children to be
exposed to such content. YouTube <xref target="youtube"/>, Yahoo! Search <xref target="yahoo"/>, Google
Search <xref target="google"/>, Bing Search <xref target="bing"/>, and many other services have such a
setting.</t>
      <t>However, a user that wishes to have this preference honoured would need to go
to each Web site in turn, navigate to the appropriate page, (possibly creating
an account along the way) to get a cookie <xref target="RFC6265"/> set in the browser. They
would need to do this for each browser on every device they use. As has been
widely noted, this is difficult <xref target="age-privacy"/>.</t>
      <t>This can be onerous to nearly impossible to achieve effectively, because there
are too many permutations of sites, user agents and devices.</t>
      <t>If instead this preference is proactively advertised by the user agent, things
become much simpler. A user agent that supports this (whether it be an
individual browser, or through an Operating System HTTP library) need only be
configured once to assure that the preference is advertised to all sites that
understand and choose to act upon it. It’s no longer necessary to go to each
site that has potentially “unsafe” content and configure a “safe” mode.</t>
      <t>Furthermore, a proxy (for example, at a school) can be used to ensure that the
preference is associated with all (unencrypted) requests flowing through it,
helping to assure that clients behind it are not exposed to “objectionable”
content.</t>
      <t>This specification defines how to associate this preference with a request,
as a HTTP Client Hint <xref target="grigorik-http-client-hints"/>.</t>
      <t>Note that this approach does not define what “safe” is; rather, it is
interpreted within the scope of each Web site that chooses to act upon this
information (or not). As such, it does not require agreement upon what “safe”
is, nor does it require application of policy in the user agent or an 
intermediary (which can be problematic for many reasons).</t>
      <section anchor="notational-conventions" title="Notational Conventions">
        <t>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
“SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

    <section anchor="the-safe-http-client-hint" title="The “safe” HTTP Client Hint">
      <t>When present in a request, the “safe” HTTP Client Hint indicates that the
user prefers content which is not objectionable, according to the server’s
definition of the concept. </t>
      <t>For example a request that includes the “safe” hint:</t>
      <figure>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
GET /foo.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.org
User-Agent: ExampleBrowser/1.0
CH: safe
]]></artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>When configured to do so, user agents SHOULD include the “safe” hint in every
request, to ensure that the preference is applied (where possible) to all
resources.</t>
      <t>For example, a Web browser might have a “Request Safe Browsing” preference
option. additionally, other clients MAY insert it; e.g., an operating system
might choose to insert the hint in requests based upon system-wide
preferences, or a proxy might do so based upon its configuration.</t>
      <t>Servers that utilise the “safe” hint SHOULD document that they do so, along
with the criteria that they use to denote objectionable content. If a site
has more fine-grained degrees of “safety”, it SHOULD select a reasonable
default to use, and document that; it MAY use additional mechanisms (e.g.,
cookies) to fine-tune.</t>
      <t>A response corresponding to the request above might have headers that look
like this:</t>
      <figure>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: text/html
Server: ExampleServer/2.0
Vary: CH
]]></artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>Note that the Vary response header needs to be sent if responses associated
with the resource might change depending on the value of the “CH” header; 
this is not only true for those responses that have changed, but also the
“default” unchanged responses.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The “safe” client hint is not a secure mechanism; it can be inserted or
removed by intermediaries with access to the data stream. Its presence reveals
information about the user, which may be of small assistance in
“fingerprinting” the user (1 bit of information, to be precise).</t>
      <t>Due to its nature, including it in requests does not assure that all content
will actually be safe; it is only when servers elect to honour it that it 
might change content. </t>
      <t>Even then, a malicious server might adapt content so that it is even less
“safe” (by some definition of the word). As such, this mechanism on its own is
not enough to assure that only “safe” content is seen; users who wish to
ensure that will need to combine its use with other techniques (e.g., content
filtering).</t>
      <t>Furthermore, the server and user may have differing ideas regarding the
semantics of “safe.” As such, the “safety” of the user’s experience when 
browsing from site to site might (and probably will) change. </t>

   In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
   the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
   capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
   interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
   should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:

<list><t>
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      RFC 2119.
</t></list></t>
            <t>
   Note that the force of these words is modified by the requirement
   level of the document in which they are used.

            <t>This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields.  These header fields can be used by HTTP servers to store state (called cookies) at HTTP user agents, letting the servers maintain a stateful session over the mostly stateless HTTP protocol.  Although cookies have many historical infelicities that degrade their security and privacy, the Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields are widely used on the Internet.  This document obsoletes RFC 2965.
