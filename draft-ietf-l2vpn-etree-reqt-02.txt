Internet Draft         Requirement E-Tree in L2VPN          October 2012


1. Introduction 

   This document provides functional requirements for Metro Ethernet 
   Forum (MEF) Ethernet Tree (E-Tree) support in L2VPN. It is intended 
   that potential solutions will use these requirements as guidelines. 

   Considerable number of service providers have adopted VPLS to provide 
   MEF Ethernet LAN (E-LAN) services to customers. Service Providers 
   currently need a simple and effective solution to emulate E-Tree 
   services in addition to E-LAN services on their MPLS networks.

   Service providers also expect E-Tree support in any newly developed 
   L2VPN technologies.

2. IETF Multipoint Ethernet L2VPN Services

2.1. VPLS 

   VPLS is a L2VPN service that provides multipoint-to-multipoint 
   connectivity for Ethernet across an IP or MPLS-enabled IP Packet 
   Switched Network. VPLS emulates the Ethernet VLAN functionality of 
   traditional Ethernet network. 

   VPLS is a current IETF standard, please refer to [RFC4761] [RFC4762]. 

   Data frame is Ethernet frame.

   Data forwarding is MAC-based forwarding, which includes MAC address 
   learning and aging.

2.2. E-VPN

   E-VPN is an enhanced Layer-2 service that emulates an Ethernet (V)LAN 
   across a PSN, primarily targeted to support large scale L2VPNs with 
   resiliency requirements not satisfied by other L2VPN solutions.

   E-VPN is currently under development. Please refer to [Draft EVPN 
   Req].

3. MEF Multipoint Ethernet Services

   MEF has defined two multipoint Ethernet Service types:
     - E-LAN (Ethernet LAN), multipoint-to-multipoint service
     - E-Tree (Ethernet Tree), rooted-multipoint service

   For full specification, please refer to [MEF6.1] [MEF10.2].

3.1. Similarity between E-LAN and E-Tree

   Data frame is Ethernet frame.



Key, et al.                Expires April 2013                  [Page 3]

Internet Draft         Requirement E-Tree in L2VPN          October 2012


   Data forwarding can be MAC-based forwarding or something else, to be 
   specified by service provider as service frame delivery attributes 
   in the particular service definition.

   A generic E-LAN/E-Tree service is always bidirectional in the sense 
   that ingress frames can originate at any endpoint in the service.

3.2. Difference between E-LAN and E-Tree

   Within the context of a multipoint Ethernet service, each endpoint is 
   designated as either a Root or a Leaf. A Root can communicate with 
   all other endpoints in the same multipoint Ethernet service, however 
   a Leaf can only communicate with Roots but not Leafs.

   The only difference between E-LAN and E-Tree is:
     - E-LAN has Root endpoints only, which implies there is no 
       communication restriction between endpoints 
     - E-Tree has both Root and Leaf endpoints, which implies there is a 
       need to enforce communication restriction between Leaf endpoints

3.3. E-Tree Use Cases

   Table 1 below presents some major E-Tree use cases.

Internet Draft         Requirement E-Tree in L2VPN          October 2012


   Common to all use cases, direct layer 2 Leaf-to-Leaf communication is 
   not required. For Mobile backhaul, this may not be valid for LTE X2 
   interfaces in the future.

   If direct layer 2 Leaf-to-Leaf communication is not allowed due to 
   security concern, then E-Tree should be used to prohibit 
   communication between Leaf endpoints, otherwise E-LAN is also a 
   feasible option.

3.4. Generic E-Tree Service

   A generic E-Tree service supports multiple Root endpoints. The need 
   for multiple Root endpoints is usually driven by redundancy 
   requirement. Whether a particular E-Tree service needs to support 
   single or multiple Roots depends on the target application.

   A generic E-Tree service supports all the following traffic flows:
     - Ethernet Unicast from Root to Leaf
     - Ethernet Unicast from Leaf to Root
     - Ethernet Unicast from Root to Root
     - Ethernet Broadcast/Multicast from Root to Roots & Leafs
     - Ethernet Broadcast/Multicast from Leaf to Roots
   A particular E-Tree service may need to support all the above or only 
   a subset depending on the target application.

4. Problem Statement

4.1. Motivation

   L2VPN can be used to emulate MEF E-LAN service over MPLS network 
   provided that the E-LAN service uses MAC-based forwarding as service 
   frame delivery attributes.

   Service providers also require E-Tree support in L2VPN.

4.2. Leaf-to-Leaf Communication Restriction

   In this section, VPLS is used to illustrate the problem, but the same 
   principle applies to other L2VPN technologies.

   Current standard VPLS treats all ACs equal (i.e. not classified into 
   Root or Leaf) and provides any-to-any connectivity among all ACs. The 
   current standard VPLS does not include any mechanism of communication 
   restriction between specific ACs, therefore is insufficient for 
   emulating generic E-Tree service over MPLS network.

   A problem occurs when there are two or more PEs with both Root AC and 
   Leaf AC. 

   Let's look at the scenario illustrated in Figure 1 below. VPLS is 
   used to emulate an E-Tree service over a MPLS network.

                    +---------+            +---------+

   Figure 1: Problem Scenario for Leaf-to-Leaf Communication Restriction

   When PE2 receives a frame from PE1 via the Ethernet PW, 
     - PE2 does not know which AC on PE1 is the ingress AC
     - PE2 does not know whether the ingress AC is a Leaf AC or not
     - PE2 does not have sufficient information to enforce the 
       Leaf-to-Leaf communication restriction

   Examples:
     - CE2 sends a Broadcast/Multicast frame to PE1 via AC2
     - CE2 sends a Unicast frame to PE1 via AC2, destination address in 
       Ethernet header equal to CE4's MAC address 

   Note: Figure 1 is a hypothetical case solely for explaining the 
   problem, and not meant to represent a typical E-Tree service.

   There are some possible ways to get around this problem that do not 
   require extension to the current standard VPLS but they all come with
   significant design complexity or deployment constraints, please refer 
   to [Draft ETree Frwk] Appendix A.
 
5. Requirements

5.1. Functional Requirements

   A solution MUST prohibit communication between any two Leaf ACs in a 
   L2VPN instance.

   A solution MUST allow multiple Root ACs in a L2VPN instance.

   A solution MUST allow Root AC and Leaf AC of a L2VPN instance 
   co-exist on any PE.

5.2. Applicability

   A solution MUST identify the L2VPN technology ([RFC4761], [RFC4761], 
   E-VPN) the solution is applicable to.

Internet Draft         Requirement E-Tree in L2VPN          October 2012


5.3. Backward Compatibility

   A solution SHOULD minimise the impact on existing L2VPN solution, 
   especially for the MEF E-LAN services already in operation.

   A solution SHOULD be backward compatible with the existing L2VPN 
   solution. It SHOULD allow a case where a common L2VPN instance is 
   composed of both PEs supporting the solution and PEs not supporting 
   it, and the Leaf-to-Leaf communication restriction is enforced 
   within the scope of the compliant PEs.

5.4. External Network Network Interface

   A solution SHOULD support Root OVC End Point, Leaf OVC End Point and
   Trunk OVC End Point specified in [MEF26.1].

6. Security Considerations 
    
   This document introduces a requirement of prohibiting communication
   between any two Leaf ACs in a L2VPN instance. Other than that, there
   are no additional security considerations beyond those already
   described in [RFC4761] [RFC4762].

7. IANA Considerations 
    
   This document has no actions for IANA.

Internet Draft         Requirement E-Tree in L2VPN          October 2012


Appendix A. Frequently Asked Questions

A.1. Are E-Tree requirements addressed in the VPMS requirement draft?

   VPMS is Virtual Private Multicast Service. VPMS requirement draft 
   refers to [Draft VPMS Frmwk].

   The focus of VPMS is to provide point-to-multipoint connectivity.

   VPMS provides single coverage of receiver membership (i.e. there is 
   no distinct differentiation for multiple multicast groups). A VPMS 
   service supports single or multiple Root ACs. All traffic from a Root 
   AC will be forwarded to all Leaf ACs (i.e. P2MP, from Root to all 
   Leafs). Destination address in Ethernet frame is not used in data 
   forwarding. As an optional capability, a VPMS service may support 
   reverse traffic from a Leaf AC to a Root AC (i.e. P2P, from Leaf to 
   Root).

   In contrast, the focus of MEF E-Tree is that a Leaf can only 
   communicate with Roots but not Leafs.

   A generic MEF E-Tree service supports multiple Root endpoints. 
   Whether a particular E-Tree service needs to support single or 
   multiple Root endpoints depends on the target application.

   A generic MEF E-Tree service supports all the following traffic 
   flows:
     - Ethernet Unicast bidirectional Root to/from Root 
     - Ethernet Unicast bidirectional Root to/from Leaf 
     - Ethernet Broadcast/Multicast unidirectional Root to all Roots & 
       Leafs
     - Ethernet Broadcast/Multicast unidirectional Leaf to all Roots. 
   A particular E-Tree service may need to support all the above or only 
   a subset depending on the target application.

   IETF's VPMS definition and MEF's E-Tree definition are significantly 
   different. 

   Only for special case E-Tree service where
     - No Unicast traffic from Root destined for a specific Leaf (or 
       there is no concern if such Unicast traffic are forwarded to all 
       Leafs)
     - No traffic between Roots
   VPMS will be able to meet the requirement. An example is E-Tree 
   service for content delivery application.

   For generic E-Tree service, VPMS will not be able to meet the 
   requirements.
