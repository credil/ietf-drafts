Internet-Draft        RADIUS Accounting Extensions            March 2012


1.  Introduction

   RADIUS has been widely used as the centralized authentication,
   authorization and user management method for the service provision in
   Broadband access network.  [RFC3162], [RFC4818] and
   [ietf-radext-ipv6-access-06] has specified some attributes to support
   the service provision for IPv6 access.  In the meantime, Radius is
   also a protocol for carrying accounting information between a Network
   Access Server and a shared accounting server.  In the scenarios of
   dual-stack or any other IPv6 transition use case, there is a demand
   to report the separated IPv4 & IPv6 traffic statistics for the
   differential accounting and traffic recording.

   [BBF TR-187], whose purpose is to describe the network architecture
   and elements requirements in the PPPoE scenario to support IPv6-only
   or dual-stack for Internet access service, has explicitly expressed
   this demand in its section 9.4.  The BNG is required to support
   separate queues and counters for IPv4 or IPv6 traffic, and the Radius
   attributes of Acct-Input-Octets, Acct-Output-Octets, Acct-Input-
   Packets, Acct-Output-Packets are recommended to use for the
   combination traffic.  New RADIUS attributes are required for the
   reporting on the separated IPv4 or IPv6 traffic statistics.  (Note
   that BNG of BBF is a kind of broadband NAS of IETF.)

   [draft-hu-v6ops-radius-issues-ipv6-00] presented the same issue on
   'protocol specific accounting' for the dual-stack traffic statistics,
   but it also limits to the PPP case.
   [draft-maglione-radext-ipv6-acct-extensions-01] and
   [draft-yeh-radext-dual-stack-access-02] tried to defined a batch of
   attributes on the traffic statistics respectively for the IPv6-only
   access and dual-stack access in the traditional flat mode, while
   [draft-winter-radext-fancyaccounting-00] indicated that the
   accounting attributes of Input-Octets, Output-Octets, Input-Packets
   and Output-Packets can be grouped in the new basic and standardizing
   data type of nesting-TLV for the extended type defined in
   [draft-ietf-radext-radius-extensions-04].  Nesting-TLV is also a
   recommended substitute of the data type for the potential attribute
   design, which intends to employ multiple fields of a new complex data
   type, in the section 6.3 of [draft-ietf-radext-radius-extensions-04].
   Based on the judge on the quickly-exhausted standard type space, the
   Radext Working Group tends to adopt the new data type of nesting-TLV
   for the accounting report of the traffic statistics.  (Note that some
   text in this section might not be necessary after the draft turns to
   be WG item.)

2.  Terminology and Language

   This document describes some new RADIUS attributes and the associated
   usage on NAS and AAA server.  This document should be read in
   conjunction with the relevant RADIUS specifications, including
   [RFC2865], [RFC2866], [RFC2869], and
   [draft-ietf-radext-radius-extensions-04], for a complete mechanism.
   Definitions for terms and acronyms not specifically defined in this
   document are defined in [RFC2865], [RFC2866], [RFC2869], [RFC3575],
   [RFC6158], and [draft-ietf-radext-radius-extensions-04].

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].


3.  Deployment Scenarios

   Figure 1 show the typical use case of the traffic statistics
   reporting for the dual-stack users.

    |  Router  |      IPoE      |          |   Accounting   |          |

        Figure 1: Traffic Statistics of Dual-Stack Users for RADIUS
                                Accounting

   Note that traffic statistics reporting is also needed in the IPv6
   transition cases, such as DS-Lite, 6rd or the potential MAP, where
   AFTR (Address Family Transition Router) or BR (Border Router) acts as
   the broadband NAS.


4.  Acct-Traffic-Statistics attribute

   The attribute of Acct-traffic-statistics is designed according to the
   guidelines described in [RFC6158] and section 6 of
   [draft-ietf-radext-radius-extensions-04].  It adopts the data
   structure of the newly defined nesting TLV, has 1 container
   attribute, Acct-Traffic-Statistics, and 5 contained sub-attributes,
   Traffic-Type, Input-Octets, Output-Octets, Input-Packets, Output-
   Packets, to support the extensible types of traffic statistics.  The
   sub-attribute of Acct-Traffic-Statistics.Traffic-Type, must be

   included in the container attribute; one or more of the other 4 sub-
   attributes much be included in the container attribute; Because sub-
   attribute has its own type code, the appearance of the contained sub-
   attribute in the container attribute is not necessary in order.

4.1.  Container attribute of Acct-Traffic-Statistics

   Description

      The attribute of Acct-Traffic-Statistics, which includes sub-
      attributes of Traffic-Type and Input-Octets, Output-Octets, Input-
      Packets or Output-Packets, reports how many octets or packets of
      the traffic class specified in the sub-attributes of Acct-Traffic-
      Statistics.Traffic-Type, from the user or sent to the user, from
      the starting of the associated service provided.  Acct-traffic-
      statistics can be present in Accounting-Request(4) message while
      the Acct-Status-Type(40) is set to Interim-Update or Stop.

   A summary of the Acct-Traffic-Statistics attribute format is shown as
   below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

4.2.  Contained attribute of Acct-Traffic-Statistics

4.2.1.  Acct-Traffic-Statistics.Traffic-Type

   Description

      The sub-attribute of Acct-Traffic-Statistics.Traffic-Type
      indicates the type of the separated and combined traffic of IPv4
      and IPv6.  (Note that [draft-winter-radext-fancyaccounting-00]
      intended to cover 'its DSCP'.)

   Length

      6

   Value

      Enumerated Data Type in 4-Octet unsigned integer defined in
      [RFC6158].  The beginning 3 Octets are reserved for future usage,
      and are set to Ox00.  The decimal value are as follows:

      0 the combined traffic of IPv4 and IPv6

      1 the separated traffic of IPv4

      2 the separated traffic of IPv6

      Discussion 1: If the Traffic-Type intends to cover the separated
      or combined IPv4 and IPv6 traffic type, and its
      DSCP(Differentiated Services Code Point), then the beginning 6
      bits of the last octet (as per RFC2474) might be used for the
      DSCP.  Or let the traffic class based on DSCP be determined in the

      future.

      Discussion 2: Is it a good idea to use the bits in this field to
      cover the change with Input/Output and Octets/Packets?

   Description

5.  Table of Attribute

   The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found
   in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.

   Req-  Acc-  Rej-  Chall  Accounting #      Attribute
   uest  ept   ect   -enge  Request
   0     0     0     0      0-1        TBA    Acct-Traffic-Statistics

   The meaning of the above table entries is as follows:

   0    This attribute MUST NOT be present.
   0+   Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be present.
   0-1  Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be present.
   1    Exactly one instance of this attribute MUST be present.
   1+   One or more of these attributes MUST be present.


6.  Diameter Considerations

   Given that the Attributes defined in this document are allocated from
   the RADIUS type space, no special handling is required by Diameter
   entities.


7.  Security Considerations

   Known security vulnerabilities of the RADIUS protocol may apply to
   its attributes.  Security issues related RADIUS are described in
   section 8 of [RFC2865], section 5 of [RFC3162].


8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign 1 new attribute type code and 5 type
   codes for its sub-attributes in the extended type space of "Radius
   Types" registry
   (http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types/radius-types.xml) for
   the following attributes:

   Acct-Traffic-Statistics
   Acct-Traffic-Statistics.Traffic-Type
   Acct-Traffic-Statistics.Input-Octets
   Acct-Traffic-Statistics.Output-Octets
   Acct-Traffic-Statistics.Input-Packets
   Acct-Traffic-Statistics.Output-Packets

   IANA should allocate these codes from the standardized extended type

   The authors would like to thank Roberta Maglione, Jie Hu for their
   efforts in the history to bring this problem to IETF, and Alan DeKok,
