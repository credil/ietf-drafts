                         The TPMKEY URI Scheme
                   draft-mavrogiannopoulos-tpmuri-00

Abstract

   This memo specifies a TPMKEY Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Scheme
   for identifying cryptographic keys stored in TPM chips and access
   using the TCG Software Stack (TSS).  The URI is based on how TPM keys
   are identified in the TSS specification.

Internet-Draft                 TPMKEY URI                   January 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a trusted piece of hardware
   built into many current devices that has been specified by the
   Trusted Computing Group (TCG) [TPMMAIN].  In addition to the chip
   itself, the TCG defined one standard way to interface with a TPM,
   called the TCG Software Stack (TSS) [TSS].

   The TSS defines several layers.  The most important ones in the
   context of this document are the TCG Service Provider (TSP) and the
   TCG Core Services (TCS).  The TSP provides the TCG services to
   applications, which in turn provide access to the TPM.  Each
   application accesses a single TSP and there is only one TCS for
   several TSPs.  The task of the TCS is to provide a common set of
   services per platform for all TSPs.

   TPM keys can be stored either in the TSP (called "user space") or in
   the TCS (called "system space").  Furthermore, the TSS assigns a UUID
   to each key.  That UUID is unique for a specific key hierarchy on a
   specific platform.  Last, keys can also be stored in so called key
   blobs, which are basically files.

   The URI scheme defined in this document is designed with a mapping to
   TPM keys that are accessed via the TSS in mind.  The URI uses only
   the scheme and the path components which are required by the Uniform
   Resource Identifier generic syntax [RFC3986].  The URI scheme does
   not use the hierarchical element for a naming authority in the path
   since the authority part could not be mapped to TPM key elements.
   The URI scheme does not use the optional query and fragment elements.

2.  TPMKEY URI Scheme Definition

   In accordance with [RFC4395], this section provides the information
   required to register the TPMKEY URI scheme.

2.1.  TPMKEY URI Scheme Name

   tsskey

2.2.  TPMKEY URI Scheme Status

   Provisional.

2.3.  TPMKEY URI Scheme Syntax

   The TPMKEY URI scheme is a sequence of attribute value pairs
   separated by a semicolon.  In accordance with [RFC3986], the data
   should first be encoded as octets according to the UTF-8 character

   encoding [RFC3629]; then only those octets that do not correspond to
   characters in the unreserved set or to permitted characters from the
   reserved set should be percent-encoded.  Rules "unreserved" and "pct-
   encoded" in the TPMKEY specification below were imported from
   [RFC3986].  As a special case, note that according to [RFC3986], a
   space must be percent-encoded.

   A TPMKEY URI takes the form (for explanation of Augmented BNF, see
   [RFC5234]):


      tsskey-URI            = "tsskey" ":" tsskey-identifier
      tsskey-identifier     = *1(tsskey-attr *(";" tsskey-attr))
      tsskey-attr           = tsskey-uuid / tsskey-file / pk11-storage
      tsskey-reserved-avail = ":" / "[" / "]" / "@" / "!" / "$" /
                              "&" / "'" / "(" / ")" / "*" / "+" /
                              "," / "="
      tsskey-char           = unreserved / tsskey-reserved-avail /
                              pct-encoded
      tsskey-file          = "file" "=" *tsskey-char
      tsskey-uuid          = "uuid" "=" *tsskey-char
      tsskey-storage       = "storage" "=" *1("user" / "system")

   The attribute "file" represents a filename and corresponds to a file
   that contains a BER-encoded blob in accordance with the ASN.1 data
   definitions in the Portable Data section of the Trusted Computing
   Group Software Stack Specification Version 1.2.  The attribute "uuid"
   represents a unique identifier of a TPM key and the attribute
   "storage" corresponds to the storage subsystem used (user or system).

2.4.  TPMKEY URI scheme semantics

   The TPMKEY URI scheme is used to reference TPM keys through the TSS.
   The allowed operations on the URI are defined by the TSS
   specification.

2.5.  TPMKEY encoding considerations

   Not sure what to write here

2.6.  applications/ protocols that use the TPMKEY URI scheme

   The TPMKEY URI scheme SHOULD be used by all application and protocols
   that use the TPM through the TSS.

3.  Examples of TPMKEY URI Schemes

   One of the simplest forms is from a key stored in the TSP.

        tsskey:uuid=7f468c16-cb7f-11e1-824d-b3a4f4b20343;storage=user

   A TPM key that is stored in a system's file.

        tsskey:file=/path/to/file

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a URI scheme.  The registration template can
   be found in Section 3 of this document.

5.  Security Considerations

   There are security considerations for URI schemes discussed in
   [RFC3986].

   Given that the TPMKEY URI is also supposed to be used in command line
   arguments to running programs, and those arguments can be world
   readable on some systems, the URI intentionaly does not allow for
   specifying the TPM key password as a URI attribute.

6.  Acknowledgements

   This document derives from [PKCS11URI].  Furthermore the authors want
   to thank Greg Kazmierczak for early feedback.
