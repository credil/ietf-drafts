                  Session Peering Disribution Protocol
                    draft-schwartz-drinks-spdist-00

Abstract

   This document defines a protocol for distributing session
   establishment data from often centralized Session Data Registries or
   SIP Service Provider data stores into local data repositories for
   local querying of the data.  The distributed data is typically used
   by various network elements for session peering.

   This document describes the Session Peering Distribution Protocol
   (SPDP) that should be seen as an extension to the session peering
   provisioning protocol defining the provisioning process itself.  The
   document provides a set of guiding principles for the design of this
   protocol including an extension of the SPPP basic data model for
   distribution purposes and an associated extension XML Schema
   Document.

1.  Introduction

   Service providers and enterprises use registries to make call or
   session routing decisions for Voice over IP, SMS and MMS traffic
   exchanges.  This document is narrowly focused on the distribution
   protocol, used to take session establishment data (SED) already
   provisioned into a registry and distribute to a local data
   repository.  This protocol prescribes a way for a registry to
   distribute to a local cache belonging to a peering entity, data
   previously provisioned to the registry by a different peering entity
   willing to share its peering data.  The requirements and use cases
   driving this protocol have been documented in
   [I-D.ietf-drinks-usecases-requirements] and the aforementioned
   provisioning protocol has been documented in
   [I-D.ietf-drinks-spprov].  The reader is expected to be familiar with
   the the previously mentioned documents.

   Three types of provisioning flows have been described in the use case
   document: client to registry provisioning, registry to local data
   repository and registry-to-registry.  This document addresses a
   subset (distribution of SED from registry-to-local repository) by
   defining a Session Peering distribution Protocol (SPDP) for this
   purpose (arrow "2" in the figure below).

                     Three Registry Provisioning Flows

   The session establishment data that is distributed to local
   repositories is typically used by various downstream SIP signaling
   systems to route a call to the next hop associated with the called
   domain.  These systems typically use a local data store ("Local Data
   Repository") as their source of session routing information.  More
   specifically, the SED data is the set of parameters that the outgoing
   signaling path border elements (SBEs) need to initiate the session.
   See [RFC5486] for more details.

   A "terminating" SIP Service Provider (SSP) provisions SED into the
   registry to be selectively shared with other peer SSPs.
   Subsequently, a Registry may distribute the provisioned data into
   local Data Repositories used for look-up queries (identifier -> URI)
   or for lookup and location resolution (identifier -> URI -> ingress
   SBE of terminating SSP).

   While the provisioning protocol [I-D.ietf-drinks-spprov] itself made
   no determination as to whether or not one common baseline protocol
   could be used for all three provisioning flows, this document, posits
   the need for an extension to the provisioning protocol to deal with
   session data distribution specific issues.  To reiterate, as this
   document is an extension of the provisioning document, it is
   imperative that the reader be familiar with the provisioning document
   before starting on this document.  Furthermore, and due to this
   dependence, SPDP will reuse the terminology, high level design and
   the data model sections found in SPPP and these sections will be
   omitted from this document.  What this document will provide is the
   rationale for a separate distribution protocol, the potentially
   different transport requirements, the potentially different security
   model and the additional protocol commands and resultant additional
   xml specification.

2.  Rationale

   While a provisioning protocol must define a data model representing
   the data being provisioned, it is not required to address issues that
   arise only once the data is actually provisioned.  Data consistency
   across stores, Data transfer size and data versioning are only some
   of the complexities that arise when attempting to distribute or
   replicate data from a master to a slave and the underlying protocol
   (data model, protocol commands, transport requirements, etc.) must
   provide support for the added functional complexity.  This section
   takes a look at aspects of data distribution that are different from
   simple data provisioning.

2.1.  Data Model Changes

   What is the SPPP model missing?  Do we need data structures that
   capture data in manner more efficient for bulk distribution?  Time-
   stamping (for versioning)?

2.2.  Multiple Data Sources

   How is this different from multiple provisioning entities?  Conflict
   mechanism?

2.3.  Multiple Local Repositories

   Consistency across destination stores. push vs pull. scaling
   considerations.

2.4.  Data Versioning

   full vs incremental synchronization

2.5.  Availability of Local Repository

   dealing with downtime when trying to distribute.

2.6.  Partitioning Across Stores

   How do we deal with data partitioning across local stores under a
   single administrative domain?

2.7.  Asynchronous distribution

   Bulk vs incremental distribution

4.  SPDP Examples

   This section shows XML message exchange between a centralized
   Registry previously provisioned with Session Establishment Data (SED)
   (using the SPPP protocol) by a peering entity SSP2 willing to share
   this information, and a local data repository residing at SSP1
   (approved by SSP2 to receive this data) needing a copy of SSP2 data.
   For the sake of simplicity, the transport wrapper for the SPDP
   protocol is left out as well as most of the provisioning messages
   already covered in the SPPP document.  The SPDP protocol messages in
   this section are valid XML instances that conform to the SPDP schema
   version within this document.

   In this sample use case scenario, SSP2 provisions resource data to
   the registry and uses SPPP constructs to selectively define sharing
   attributes of the route groups.  SPDP is subsequently used to have
   this information distributed to relevant local repository.  In the
   figure below, SSP2 has two ingress SBE instances that are associated
   with the public identities that SSP2 has the retail relationship
   with.

5.  Security Considerations

   SPDP implementations manage data that is considered confidential and
   critical.  Furthermore, SPDP implementations can support provisioning
   activities for multiple registrars and registrants.  As a result any
   SPDP implementation must address the requirements for
   confidentiality, authentication, and authorization.

   With respect to confidentiality and authentication, the transport
   protocol section contains some security properties that the transport
   protocol must provide so that authenticated endpoints can exchange
   data confidentially and with integrity protection.

   With respect to authorization, the SPDP server implementation must
   define and implement a set of authorization rules that precisely
   address (1) which local repositories will be authorized to get each
   SPDP object type for given registrant(s).  These authorization rules
   are left as a matter of policy and are not specified within the
   context of SPDP.  However, any SPDP implementation must specify these
   authorization rules in order to function in a reliable and safe
   manner.
