Abstract

   This document presents a solution suite for TRILL campuses to be
   connected over WAN networks. TRILL protocol is primarily designed to
   work within intra-data centers. Connecting different sites over WAN
   using overlay tunnel protocols is the primary method employed at
   present. Though this presents a simple mechanisms to extend TRILL
   campuses over WAN networks, it also brings in the problem of
   scalability for TRILL nicknames exchanged between sites, latency,
   duplication of traffic etc. This draft proposes a way to extend the
   TRILL sites without having the WAN network aware of TRILL campus
   network and its topology. This document details on how to extend
   TRILL campus sites and to establish connections between various sites
   without having to exchange entire TRILL campus information, thus
   reducing the information flow to the required sites only. This
   document do not add or define datacenter interconnect protocol.

INTERNET DRAFT           TRILL Campus Extension             July 9, 2012


1  Introduction

   TRILL protocol is primarily designed as an intra-datacenter protocol
   by leveraging the routing functionality to interconnect bridges.
   Traditional Ethernet networks provided a single path for forwarding
   the traffic, which is usually derived using protocols like Spanning
   Tree. TRILL provided a way to utilize multiple links for forwarding,
   thus utilizing the resources effectively. Even though TRILL is new
   protocol, it seamlessly integrates with legacy bridging networks
   without having to forklift upgrade of all the bridges to support
   TRILL. By not having to learn the MAC addresses of end stations by
   intermediate devices, provided a powerful way to interconnect bridges
   within a datacenter and maximizing the resource usage and providing
   multipath usage option.

   TRILL enabled network creates efficiency by having reduced forwarding
   table size. By doing TRILL nickname based forwarding created a layer
   of abstraction and much easier to implement the protocol. This
   enabled to address the scalability of a L2 domain, where thousands of
   RBridges could exist to meet the needs of a datacenter. By leveraging
   IS-IS protocol, the information exchange and leveraging the path
   computation technology brought forth a new paradigm into bridging
   technology. TRILL Base Protocol Specification [RFC6325] specifies a
   tree based paradigm to forward broadcast and multicast traffic as
   well as unknown unicast traffic.

   Even though the TRILL is enabled within a campus network or a
   datacenter, it is not primarily designed to work over WAN. There is a
   need to interconnect various TRILL campuses to extend beyond a single
   LAN domain. Some enterprise or campus networks could be having
   multiple TRILL sites and these TRILL enabled sites could run
   independently or could share resources in order to cater to the needs
   of customers or users. As such, there exist few proposals based on
   overlay technologies which interconnect these sites but those
   solutions require MAC learning at the edge RBridges and stripping of
   TRILL nickname on the frame. Another option is to interconnect these
   TRILL sites transparently over Pseudowires and making a huge TRILL
   campus site. This is useful option but the downside of this is when
   provider would like to maintain independent sites and exchange only
   the required data to be shared across sites, it becomes complicated
   to maintain the networks. 

   [TRILL-EVPN] draft details the data center protocol in interconnect
   different LAN domains, including TRILL sites, over VPN's. This
   requires establishing VPN's over WAN using BGP protocol, thus
   requiring WAN service provider involvement in establishing
   interconnection between different sites.

INTERNET DRAFT           TRILL Campus Extension             July 9, 2012


   This draft solves a specific problem where a TRILL campus needs to be
   extended, be it a different geographical location or network
   administrative domain. Though the primary goal is effective extension
   of TRILL campuses, this draft is not a replacement for datacenter
   interconnect protocols like PBB_EVPN. All the extensions are limited
   to TRILL protocol, without any extensions to WAN protocols for
   interconnect, such that, effective unicast and multicast traffic
   could be sent over WAN links and keeping core network agnostic of the
   TRILL network.

2.  Solution overview

   This section provides the high-level overview of the solution to the
   problems in various scenarios. More detailed representation of the
   solution is covered in the later sections of the draft.

   TRILL site or TRILL campus uses IS-IS to setup the RBridge
   interconnection. A RBridge knows how to reach another RBridge within
   the campus. When two TRILL campuses are interconnected, one could
   visualize it in two different perspectives. First one is a merger of
   two TRILL campuses into one. This requires each RBridge to know about
   the other and the IS-IS should be able to compute the shortest paths
   from one to another. The downside of this model is that information
   exchange explosion and the size of IS-IS db and number of PDU's being
   exchanged could increase exponentially.

   The second perspective is to have these two TRILL campuses being
   interconnected over a WAN, but their functioning nature is
   independent to each other. The two campuses exchange only the

   required information between border RBridges of the campuses. This
   will be more optimal and leads to interconnecting multiple campuses
   without having to redesign the whole network to ensure uniqueness and
   identity of RBridges.

   Solution being proposed is in line with second option, which
   maintains site independency with a simplified solution and modeled
   around the existing and proven technologies. Some of the enhancements
   were already proposed in other drafts like multilevel TRILL [TISSA-
   MLEVEL] and the solution leverages by extending those definitions as
   necessary. The solution addresses the following areas described in
   the following sections

2.1  Site inter-connection

   Each TRILL campus is considered as an independent site or an L1 IS-IS
   domain. These TRILL campus sites are interconnected over WAN. Each
   area will have an appointed border RBridges. These RBridges exchange
   the information of other border RBridges of different TRILL campus
   sites to establish connection with each other. When a TRILL campus is
   extended by interconnecting two or more campuses, the interconnection
   could be over L2 or L3 WAN connection. A frame from an RBridge in
   campus, to reach other RBridge in other campus, should be aware of
   the path it should take. When a frame is sent from the border RBridge
   to another Border RBridge in the other campus, it traverses the WAN
   network. This is transparent to the source RBridge in order to reach
   the destination RBridge. The WAN connection established between the
   campuses is not aware of the traffic it is carrying and is not
   established based on the TRILL campuses.


2.2 Requirements overview

   There are various requirements necessary to be met in order to
   provide a seamless TRILL campus extension. Some of the important
   requirements are as follows

   o Extend TRILL technology over interconnect

   o Ability to provide the same fast convergence for mobility as it
   does in intra-TRILL campus

   o Ability to work transparent with various WAN technologies

   o Option for dynamic establishment of connectivity across sites

   o Minimal changes to TRILL protocol and definitions

INTERNET DRAFT           TRILL Campus Extension             July 9, 2012


   o Backward compatible to existing networks and their functions.


   In some scenarios it may be required for TRILL to be extended over an
   IP network, for example a case where the network administrator does
   not have control over the wide area network configuration. The TRILL
   over IP solution should meet the requirements outlined above and
   additionally:

   o Require only unciast reachability between RBridges and multicast
   support from the WAN provider

   o Provide Auto-discovery of Border Rbridges 

2.2  TRILL campus extension

   By interconnecting TRILL campus sites over WAN, one could extend the
   L1 area, but that would cause other issues as detailed in the earlier
   section. When two campuses merge, there will be a possibility for
   nickname collision. The ideal situation is to keep the ability for
   each campus nicknames overlapped with the other campus. The other
   option is to provide a mechanism to do the nickname resolution. This
   version of the document details the solution of the later option. In
   the subsequent version, the former option for retaining nicknames
   will be addressed.

2.3  TRILL nickname exhaustion

   Though this draft is not meant to provide solution for TRILL nickname
   exhaustion, it enables provider to deal with the problem effectively
   and not having to re-design the network, every time a new campus is
   interconnected. The proposed solution has RBridges which are not
   required to be exposed outside of the campus and there are other
   RBridges which are also known as border RBridges. This version the
   document assumes global uniqueness of TRILL nicknames across various
   campuses. When a frame has to be forwarded to an RBridge which
   resides in another campus, the originating RBridge knows how to get
   to the borderRBridge. This border RBridge should have the list of
   RBridges of other campus sites and thus could select the appropriate
   link connecting to the destination campus and encapsulate the TRILL
   frame and forward over that. More details are covered in the unicast
   and multicast sections of the detailed solution.

3. Solution analysis and comparison

   As eluded to in the earlier sections, there are various methods on
   interconnecting different TRILL campus sites. Before going into the
   details of proposed solution a close examination of some of the

INTERNET DRAFT           TRILL Campus Extension             July 9, 2012


   proposed solutions, provides better perspective of this solution.

3.1  TRILL campus extension

   In this model TRILL campuses are connected over WAN using
   technologies like PW. This is the most simple way of interconnecting
   the sites. When campuses are interconnected, the TRILL campus will
   get expanded and each RBridge could reach each other. The main
   criteria for this will be to maintain unique nickname for RBridges.
           --------------       ------------       --------------       
          |              |     |            |     |              |      
          |TRILL Campus  |     |  WAN       |     | TRILL Campus |      
          |              |     |            |     |              |      
          |             BRB1===|            |====BRB2            |      
          RB1            |     |            |     |              RB2    
          |              |     |            |     |              |      
          |              |     |            |     |              |      
          --------------       ------------       --------------

   As shown in the figure above, two TRILL campuses are interconnected
   over WAN. Border RBridges establish connection over WAN using PW or
   other WAN technologies. All the nicknames within each campus sites
   have to be unique. The WAN in this case is transparent to the TRILL
   campuses and the path computation doesn't involve WAN component,
   instead it will be like one TRILL campus. When RB1 originates a TRILL
   frame destined to RB2, it traverses over BRB1 and BRB2 and reaches
   RB2.

   This solution is workable when the campuses are small and do NOT need
   to change or requires interconnecting more TRILL campuses. The other
   downside for this model is, when two campuses are interconnected and
   there is overlap of nicknames, the network has to be re-designed to
   eliminate the duplicate nicknames and make each RBrige to have a
   unique nickname.

3.2  TRILL campus extension over IP

   The TRILL campus could be extended by encapsulating TRILL inside an
   IP Tunnel. By using this method the WAN becomes completely
   transparent and is only required to provide unicast reachability
   between BRbridges and establish the multicast trees.

   Each BRbridge maintains a mapping table between the egress nickname
   and an IP address. When a BRbridge receives a frame destined for a
   remote BRBridge it looks up the egress nickname in the mapping table
   and applies an outer IP header where the destination address is equal
   to the Remote BRBridge IP.

   should be TRILL aware as well as to be able to speak WAN protocols
   like BGP. When a TRILL frame arrives at border RBridge, based on the
   nickname it will be forwarded onto a right VPN link setup for the
   destination nickname.

   These VPN's could be established statically or dynamically. In order
   to establish dynamically, the border RBridges needs to exchange
   information of the nicknames and connect different sites. The
   hierarchical model like H-VPLS could be established as well. One
   other option which is much similar to the first model where campuses
   exchange TRILL nicknames with other campuses over VPN's. Though this
   model groups different sites according to the way VPN's are
   configured, avoiding flooding of TRILL nicknames or site independency
   cannot be achieved.

4. Operational Overview

4.1 Campus and Backbone Areas

   Each TRILL campus will be assigned a border RBridge. This is
   identified using the 'Attached' bit in the IS-IS PDU. The border
   RBridge has list of the RBridges of each campus site. These list of
   bridges are exchanged using the TRILL nickname aggregation sub-TLV.
   Details of the sub-TLV are detailed in the below section.

   Every TRILL campus campus need not exchange all the RBridge nicknames
   with other campuses. Let us take the scenario of campus A to be
   interconnected with campus B. In campus A, there are RBridges
   RB1...RB10, which are interconnected in L1. These nicknames are not
   tunneled or exchanged with other L1 campus sites. Similarly campus B
   has RB11...RB20 and need not be distinct from campus A RBridge
   nicknames.  So, if a new campus is connected to the domain, there is
   a conflict of nicknames. As described in the earlier section, when
   nicknames have to be uniquely maintained, the draft describes a
   solution. Solution with keeping same nickname across different TRILL
   campuses will be addressed in the later versions of the draft.

   When campuses are interconnected over WAN links, there are two
   possible terminations of the WAN links, the border RBridge and an
   edge PE device. If the RBridge is connected to PE device, the TRILL
   frames could be sent over the link connecting to the PE device to be
   transported across WAN. This process is transparent to the TRILL
   network and the RBridge doesn't remove the TRILL encapsulation,
   rather tunnel the frames over the WAN to the far end RBridge.

   There are many ways the WAN connections could be provided from
   RBridge. GRE tunnels, IP tunnels, MPLS LSP's etc. Details of these is
   outside the scope of this draft as it is transparent to RBridge.

   The border RBridges will have the complete information of its campus
   RBridges. Not all of the RBridges nicknames need to be advertised
   globally. So, the globally exchanged nicknames of RBridges should be
   unique across campuses. Depending on the policy established, these
   Border RBridges will exchange the TRILL information with other campus
   border Bridges, between different campuses. In IS-IS domain the
   equivalent of this is the L2 backbone area, which in this case, is
   established over WAN.

4.2 Unicast forwarding

   If the destination TRILL nickname is not known, the originating or
   transit RBridges forwards it to border RBridge. As the border RBridge
   has all the nicknames of each campus, it forwards the frame to the
 


Aldrin, et.al.          Expires January 10, 2013               [Page 12]

INTERNET DRAFT           TRILL Campus Extension             July 9, 2012


   right campus border RBridge, which in turn could forward within its
   campus as per base protocol specification [RFC6325]. In the case
   where the destination is unknown, the frame is flooded to each
   campus. Using the MAC learning procedures, the associated RBridge
   will be learnt for the subsequent frames to be forwarded as unicast,
   instead of flooding. Flooding into various campuses or TRILL data
   sites happen only if the the frame is of global ID based on VLAN
   identification.

4.3 Multicast Forwarding

   Whether the traffic scope is local or global across campuses is
   identified by VLAN or port or fine-grain label. If the traffic is to
   be forwarded within campus, it is done using the local tree. But if
   the forwarding has to be done globally, it needs to use the global
   tree. When the frame has global context, it will be flooded into
   other TRILL sites as well. 

   Multicast networks are established within the core networks. In the
   case of RBridges, which are part of the customer networks and do not
   participate in the core networks and their topologies, the multicast
   tree could be built using IP multicast or leverage MVPN services
   offered by the core network service provider. The global trees are
   established between border RBridges with the help of information
   exchanges between border RBridges. As the IS-IS is limited to
   individual campus sites, the information for the backbone tree over
   WAN has to be exchanged between border RBridges either as a IP
   multicast PIM message or specific TLV indented for other campus
   border RBridges. More details on this will be added in the later
   versions of the draft.

                               -----RB3----


   In the above figure when the multicast frame has to be sent from
   campus 1 to campus 2 and 3, the frame arrives at border RBridge BRB1.
   With the default global tree between border RBridges of different
   campuses, the forwarding is setup to egress the frame or replicated
   over multicast trees to all other campus sites. If the frame is
   destined for non-default global tree, the frame is forwarded
   according to the forwarding information established for the tree.

   Once the frame is reached on the border router of the campuses, the
   frame is locally multicast forwarded. The same technique as employed
   in the multilevel draft [TISSA-MLEVEL] is used here as well.

   If mVPN services are deployed interconnecting campus sites, the
   multicast tree is built over these services based on the customer
   VLANs.

4.4 MAC learning

   When a frame is to be forwarded from customer MAC A to customer MAC
   B, the frame is set as unknown unicast frame over TRILL networks. If
   the MAC A and MAC B are connected over WAN, the frame is transmitted
   over WAN to the other campus. When the frame is reached at the
   RBridge connecting to MAC B, it will learn about the originator
   RBridge for MAC A. While responding, the egress RBridge know the
   originating RBridge, it will unicast the frame to the originator.

INTERNET DRAFT           TRILL Campus Extension             July 9, 2012


4.5 TRILL nickname aggregation

   Nicknames are allocated or assigned to RBridges in a given campuses
   using various methods. It could be OSS, CLI or could be a dynamic
   control protocol which configures the nicknames. As the nicknames are
   confined to each L1 area, the nickname management, when sites are
   connected over WAN, it is essential to optimize the name allocation
   in order to use the name space effectively. Name allocation is not in
   the scope of this draft. If there is a necessity, the topic could be
   considered in the later revisions of the draft. For this version we
   do recommend some of the optimization techniques for nickname
   allocation defined in the multilevel draft [TISSA-MLEVEL].

   Each border RBridges needs to exchange the nicknames of each campuses
   with other border RBridges. As the border RBridges are connected over
   various types of WAN networks, mandating enhancement to a specific
   protocol is deemed not the right approach. As the information
   exchange has to be done, certain characteristics for the data
   exchange have to be met.

   o The amount of data exchange has to be minimal and optimized.

   o the information exchange has to be quick.

   o Conflicts and duplicate information flow has to be avoided

   This draft proposes a generic TLV, which is to be exchanged between
   border RBridges. If the nickname allocation is done in terms of
   ranges, the same could be exchanged between border RBridges,
   seamlessly. As the TLV has to be terminated at the border RBridges,
   it is better suited to be sent as a unicast message to the
   neighboring border RBridge. This could be sent as an IP message with
   TRILL header containing the target border RBridge. More details on
   how to encapsulate and process the frame should be in the later
   versions of the draft.

5. TRILL campus inter-connectivity

   The primary reason to interconnect TRILL campuses is to maintain
   geographically distant, segmented sites and customer specific
   segregation possible by interconnecting and not having to redo the
   network and campus redesign for every change and need. With customers
   being mobile or services offered by service providers could be re-
   located depending on the time-zones and resource availability,
   restricting to a specific site is a thing of the past. 

   These constraints brought forth the need to have different sites
   interconnected over the WAN, be it MPLS or VPLS or IP and to provide

   the services on demand to meet the needs of customers and their data
   center needs. As TRILL has proven to be an effective protocol by
   bringing routing technologies into bridges or L2 forwarding, the
   short coming of TRILL interconnect is to be overcome. As eluded to in
   the earlier sections on different kinds of solutions, meeting all the
   needs of the TRILL campus extension as laid out in the requirements
   section, is the primary goal of this draft.

5.1 Border RBridges interconnection

   Border RBridges only participate in interconnecting various TRILL
   campuses. These border RBridges are elected or identified as
   described in the earlier section i.e. using IS-IS protocol
   advertisement. These border RBridges, when required to interconnect
   with other campuses, over WAN, depending on configuration of choice,
   an overlay tunnels like GRE could be established between the border
   RBridges. advertise the route to other site border RBridges using the
   BGP enhancement. The connectivity between different campuses over WAN
   is already established. When two RBridges needs to be connected over,
   a GRE or IP tunnel is established between those two. Detailed
   mechanisms on this establishments will be addressed in the later
   versions of the draft.

   If L2 connectivity is to be used with protocols like VPLS, a similar
   method could be employed, where the PWE3 could be established between
   border RBridges. More details to be added in the later versions of
   the draft.

5.2 Inter-site nickname exchange

   There are three types of nicknames which are exchanged between border
   RBridges.

   o Nickname of border RBridges

   o Nicknames of RBridges for each campus

   o Nicknames of RBridges which are part of a specific customer VLAN or
   VPN

   The nickname aggregation TLV is used as payload to be exchanged
   between border RBridges. This information is used to establish inter-
   connectivity between TRILL sites per customer VLAN or default global
   tree. There exchange of information could be done with existing
   protocols and is not restricted to any specific protocol.

   An additional capability TLV is defined to exchange info on what each
   of the border RBridge is capable of. This is very essential for
   forward and backward capability . Capability information not only
   indicates the capability version but could also force the
   interconnection to be restricted as per the policy set by the
   customer. Some of the capability advertisements are as follows.

   o Version.

   o default nick name resolution

   o connect more campuses

   o active-active link support

   o Ability to support multicast forwarding

5.4 TRILL adjacency resolution

   When a frame is to be forwarded from one campus to another, the
   adjacency resolution has to be done on the border RBridge. When TRILL
   nicknames are advertised from one border RBridge to another, the
   border RBridge keeps the database of all the nicknames. 

   Once the frame is received on the border RBridge, it will look in the
   forwarding table to identify the next hop. The adjacency information
   could indicate the outgoing WAN encapsulation. For VPN, there could
   be additional encapsulation depending on the network configuration.
   The TRILL frame is encapsulated, without removing the TRILL header
   and is forwarded over the WAN link.

5.5 Forwarding of data frames

   The TRILL frames are forwarded as per the base protocol [RFC6325]
   within a campus site. The forwarding of the frames from TRILL campus
   to campus over WAN connection is pre-established between border
   RBridges. The encapsulation of the Frame with WAN header is based on
   the adjacency resolution made in the forwarding on the border
   RBridge.

6. Proposed additions and extensions

   There are certain extensions being proposed in this draft to
   interconnect TRILL campuses or datacenters. These include new
   additions to routing and also new TLV's to exchange information
   between border RBridges. There are few references to the extensions
   proposed in other drafts which are used in this draft as well.

7. TRILL campus extension over IP

7.1 Underlying Network

   The underlying network in the TRILL campus extension over IP solution
   could be Wide Area Network. As changes to this network are not in the
   administrative control of the TRILL campus, TRILL over IP extends the
   campus network by having unicast reach ability between BRbridges and
   the ability to establish IP multicast trees over it. There are three
   ways the TRILL campus could be extended over IP.

   1. TRILL frames, both control and data frames are transparently
   tunneled over IP. This is also known as overlay model.

   2. TRILL and IS-IS control frames are terminated at the campus edge
   and data frames are tunneled transparently.

   3. TRILL and IS-IS control frames are terminated at the campus edge
   and data frames are stripped off the TRILL header 


7.2 Overlay Control Plane The TRILL over IP overlay control plane is
   responsible for the auto-discovery of the BRbridges within the same
   domain. The TRILL control plane traffic between BRbridges will be
   carried over the virtual link. There is no termination of either
   TRILL control plane or data plane frames at the edge of the TRILL
   campus networks.

7.2.1 BRbridge discovery and adjacency setup BRbridges become part of
   the domain when the join the multicast group on the underlying
   network associated with the domain. The auto-discovery mechanism
   happens when BRbridges peer with each other as if they were directly
   connected at layer-2.  This peering is possible as all the traffic
   for the BRbridge is encapsulated with the underlying network
   multicast group address and sent into the core.

7.2.2 Control plane packet encapsulation

   Any BRbridge in a TRILL over IP domain should encapsulate the ISIS
   routing information of its campus and then relay it to the other
   BRbridges in the domain. The control frames are tunnel through the IP
   connection established between BRbridges.

7.4 Forwarding Process

7.4.1.  Forwarding from an Internal Link to the Overlay

   The forwarding within a campus is as defined in the base protocol of
   TRILL. This section here describes the forwarding from an Internal
   link to the Overlay Link, or vice versa. A Joint Device is a transit
   Rbridge from TRILL point of view. When a TRILL packet is received
   from the internal interface, egress Nickname is used to lookup the
   Nickname table which will yield a next-hop IP address entry pointing
   to a remote Joint Device.  Then the packet is encapsulated with
   UDP/IP header and sent over the overlay interface to destination
   Joint Device at Layer-3 as a regular IP packet.

7.4.2.  Forwarding from the Overlay Link to an Internal Link When a
   packet is received on the overlay interface, it will be IP de-
   capsulated to reveal the inner TRILL(including the outer MAC) header
   for forwarding.  The egress Nickname will used for forwarding, the
   forwarding action is same as a transit RBridge.

7.4.5.  Mac Address Learning

   The TRILL edge devices learn remote MAC addresses(including the MAC
   addresses in other data centers) in data plane by hardware.  In most
   cases, the Joint device is like a transit RBridge, and doesn't learn
   end host's MAC addresses.  From campus extension perspective, the
   border device is DCI device at the same time, so TRILL over WAN can
   relieve the pressure of MAC addresses table capability in DCI device.

7.4.6.  Multi-homing

   In the situation of multi-homing shown as Figure 3, all the BRbridges
   can be active by the nature of TRILL. Figure 4 shows what the
   resulting forwarding tables would look like in the multi-homing
   example.

   In S1 device, the traffic destined to S10 and S21 have two next hops,
   IPC and IPD.  In forwarding process, hashing of TRILL packet inner
   information will be used to determine which next hop IP address to
   use.  Thus, the ingress traffic will be load balanced between
   multiple Joint Devices within a site.

7.5 Control plane termination

INTERNET DRAFT           TRILL Campus Extension             July 9, 2012


   When TRILL campuses are extended by interconnecting them, the
   administrative domain for control plane could be independent, where
   as the data plane could be transparently interconnected. This
   requires the campus border RBridges to terminate the control plane.
   The IS-IS control frames do not get encapsulated and sent over to the
   the IP connection. Border RBridges exchange the campus information
   over IP in order to program the forwarding table and adjacency
   resolution.

   Data frames when arrived at the border RBridges, destined for the
   other campus, will be looked for adjacency and encapsulated with IP
   and sent over the IP. In the case of multicast, the TRILL frame is
   encapsulated and sent over IP multicast network.

7.6 Control plane termination and Data plane de-capsulation

   When two campuses are interconnected but no control plane or data
   plane is extended over the WAN, the TRILL frames are stripped off the
   TRILL header at the border RBridge of the campus. The payload is then
   encapsulated as a regular IP packet and sent over the IP network to
   the other campus. This requires the border RBridges to learn the host
   MAC address to properly encapsulate as IP packet and routed across
   the WAN link.

8  Security Considerations

   <TBD>


9  IANA Considerations

   It is requested that the IANA allocate the following UDP Ports for
   the TRILL IS-IS and Data channels:
