Abstract

   This document describes the use of the ARIA block cipher algorithm
   within the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) for providing
   confidentiality for the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) traffic
   and for the control traffic for RTP, the Real-time Transport Control
   Protocol (RTCP). It details three modes of operation (CTR, CCM, GCM)
   and a SRTP Key Derivation Function for ARIA.



1. Introduction

   This document describes the use of the ARIA [RFC5794] block cipher
   algorithm in the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711]
   for providing confidentiality for the Real-time Transport Protocol
   (RTP) [RFC3550] traffic and for the control traffic for RTP, the
   Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) [RFC3550].

1.1. ARIA

   ARIA is a general-purpose block cipher algorithm developed by Korean
   cryptographers in 2003. It is an iterated block cipher with 128-,
   192-, and 256-bit keys and encrypts 128-bit blocks in 12, 14, and 16
   rounds, depending on the key size. It is secure and suitable for
   most software and hardware implementations on 32-bit and 8-bit
   processors. It was established as a Korean standard block cipher
   algorithm in 2004 [ARIAKS] and has been widely used in Korea,
   especially for government-to-public services. The algorithm
   specification and object identifiers are described in [RFC5794].

1.2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].



2. Cryptographic Transforms

   Block ciphers ARIA and AES share common characteristics including
   mode, key size, and block size. ARIA does not have any restrictions
   for modes of operation that are used with this block cipher. We
   define three modes of running ARIA within the SRTP protocol, (1)

   ARIA in Counter Mode, (2) ARIA in Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) Mode
   and (3) ARIA in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM).


2.1. ARIA-CTR

   Section 4.1.1 of [RFC3711] defines AES-128 counter mode encryption,
   which it refers to as "AES_CM". Section 2 of [RFC6188] defines
   "AES_192_CM" and "AES_256_CM" in SRTP. ARIA counter modes are
   defined in a similar manner, and are denoted by ARIA_128_CTR,
   ARIA_192_CTR and ARIA_256_CTR respectively, according to the key
   lengths. The plaintext inputs to the block cipher are formed as in
   AES-CTR(AES_CM, AES_192_CM, AES_256_CM) and the block cipher outputs
   are processed as in AES-CTR. The only difference in the processing
   is that ARIA-CTR uses ARIA as the underlying encryption primitive.
   When ARIA-CTR is used, it MUST be used only in conjunction with an
   authentication function.

   The ARIA-CTR ciphersuites with HMAC-SHA1 as an authentication
   function are listed below. For each ciphersuites, the authentication
   key size is 20 octets.

        ARIA_128_CTR_HMAC_SHA1_80  16 octets      10 octets
        ARIA_128_CTR_HMAC_SHA1_32  16 octets      4 octets
        ARIA_192_CTR_HMAC_SHA1_80  24 octets      10 octets
        ARIA_192_CTR_HMAC_SHA1_32  24 octets      4 octets
        ARIA_256_CTR_HMAC_SHA1_80  32 octets      10 octets
        ARIA_256_CTR_HMAC_SHA1_32  32 octets      4 octets


2.2. ARIA-CCM and ARIA-GCM

   CCM(Counter with CBC-MAC) [RFC3610] and GCM(Galois Counter Mode)
   [GCM] are AEAD(authenticated encryption with associated data) block
   cipher modes. ARIA-CCM and ARIA-GCM are defined similarly as AES-CCM
   and AES-GCM.

   The internet draft [McGrew02] describes the use of AES-GCM and AES-
   CCM with SRTP. The use of ARIA-CCM and ARIA-GCM with SRTP is defined
   the same as that of AES-CCM and AES-GCM.

   The following members of the ARIA-CCM family may be used with
   SRTP/SRTCP:

   The following members of the ARIA-CCM family may be used with
   SRTP/SRTCP:

        AEAD_ARIA_256_CCM     32 octets     16 octets


3. ARIA-CTR PRF

   Section 4.3.3 of [RFC3711] defines the AES-128 counter mode key
   derivation function, which it refers to as "AES-CM PRF". Section 3
   of [RFC6188] defines the AES-192 counter mode key derivation
   function and the AES-256 counter mode key derivation function, which
   it refers to as "AES_192_CM_PRF" and "AES_256_CM_PRF" respectively.
   The ARIA-CTR PRF is defined in a similar manner, but with each
   invocation of AES replaced with an invocation of ARIA. According to
   the key lengths of underlying encryption algorithm, ARIA-CTR PRFs
   are denoted by "ARIA_128_CTR_PRF", "ARIA_192_CTR_PRF" and
   "ARIA_256_CTR_PRF". The usage requirements of [RFC6188] regarding
   the AES-CM PRF apply to the ARIA-CTR PRF as well. The PRFs for ARIA
   ciphersuites with SRTP are defined by ARIA-CTR PRF of the equal key
   length with the encryption algorithm.


4. Security Considerations

   At the time of writing this document no security problem has been
   found on ARIA (see [YWL]).

   The security considerations in [RFC3610,GCM,RFC3711,RFC6188,McGrew02]
   apply to this document as well.

5. IANA Considerations

   [RFC4568] defines SRTP "crypto suites". In order to allow SDP to
   signal the use of the algorithms defined in this document, IANA is
   requested to register the following crypto suites into the sub-
   registry for SRTP crypto suites under the SRTP transport of the SDP

   DTLS-SRTP [RFC5764] defines a DTLS-SRTP "SRTP Protection Profile".
   In order to allow the use of the algorithms defined in this document
   in DTLS-SRTP, IANA will also register the following SRTP Protection
   Profiles:

       SRTP_ARIA_128_CTR_HMAC_SHA1_80  = {TBD,TBD};
       SRTP_ARIA_128_CTR_HMAC_SHA1_32  = {TBD,TBD};
       SRTP_ARIA_192_CTR_HMAC_SHA1_80  = {TBD,TBD};
       SRTP_ARIA_192_CTR_HMAC_SHA1_32  = {TBD,TBD};
       SRTP_ARIA_256_CTR_HMAC_SHA1_80  = {TBD,TBD};
       SRTP_ARIA_256_CTR_HMAC_SHA1_32  = {TBD,TBD};
       SRTP_AEAD_ARIA_128_GCM          = {TBD,TBD};
       SRTP_AEAD_ARIA_256_GCM          = {TBD,TBD};
       SRTP_AEAD_ARIA_128_GCM_8        = {TBD,TBD};
       SRTP_AEAD_ARIA_256_GCM_8        = {TBD,TBD};
       SRTP_AEAD_ARIA_128_GCM_12       = {TBD,TBD};
       SRTP_AEAD_ARIA_256_GCM_12       = {TBD,TBD};
       SRTP_AEAD_ARIA_128_CCM          = {TBD,TBD};
       SRTP_AEAD_ARIA_256_CCM          = {TBD,TBD};
