Internet-Draft  Cloud SDO Activities Survey and Analysis   December 2011


1.  Introduction

   This draft presents a survey of the SDOs related to cloud activities.
   By conducting a comprehensive survey, gaps and overlaps in cloud
   standards can be determined.  This will allow us to determine the
   IETF work that would be required to address the gaps.  Once these
   IETF work have been completed, seamless interoperability of cloud
   services can be realized.

2.  Terminology

   Cloud-based systems are conveniently-connected modular blocks of
   resources

   o  Both physical and virtual modularizations of resources are
      possible

   o  For this discussion, the resources include computing (CPU),
      communications (network), memory, storage, management, database,
      software, applications, services, interconnectivity, etc.

   o  The objective is to make the resources available ubiquitously for
      mission-specific applications and services.  These resources are
      used to support the ultimate level of privacy/security,
      scalability and reliability cost-effectively and without the
      headache of owning and maintaining the infrastructure.

   Service over Cloud

   o  Utilize (stitch, weave, embroider, ...) the virtualized resources
      from cloud to provision, create, deliver, and maintain an End-to-
      End Service

   o  Use the service only when you Need it

   o  Pay only for the time duration and type of use of service (include
      the costs for resources used)

3.  Survey of other SDOs

3.1.  ARTS (The Association for Retail Technology Standards)

   The ARTS is dedicated to creating an open environment where both
   retailers and technology vendors work together to create
   international retail technology standards and to reduce the costs of
   the technology.  Recently, this group also started looking at
   researching cloud computing and developing white papers to address
   cloud issues.  Cloud Computing team starts work on a "mini
   RFP(Request for Proposal)" to help retailers evaluate cloud
   strategies and solutions.  ARTS is a separate council within the
   NRF(National Retail Federation) governed by a council of retailers
   and technology solution providers.

   ARTS has four standards/Committees:

   o  UnifiedPOS - Committee Chair Paul Gay, Epson

   o  Data Model - Committee Chair Lynn Myers, Lowe's Companies

   o  ARTS XML - Committee Chair Tim Hood, SAP

   o  Standard RFPs - Committee Chair Ann McCool

   ARTS Cloud Computing for Retail White Paper, Best Practices
   Documents.  This Cloud Computing for Retail whitepaper offers
   unbiased guidance for achieving maximum results from this relatively
   new technology.  Version 1.0 represents a significant update to the
   draft version released in October 2009, specifically providing more
   examples of cloud computing in retail, as well as additional
   information on the relationship to Service Oriented Architecture
   (SOA) and constructing a Private Cloud.

   Status: Active.

   Partnership/Coordination: NRF.

   Language: English.

3.2.  ATIS (Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions).

   ATIS prioritizes the industry's most pressing, technical and
   operational issues, and creates interoperable, implementable, end to
   end solutions -- standards when the industry needs them and where
   they need them.

Internet-Draft  Cloud SDO Activities Survey and Analysis   December 2011


   Over 600 industry professionals from more than 250 communications
   companies actively participate in ATIS committees and incubator
   solutions programs.

   ATIS develops standards and solutions addressing a wide range of
   industry issues in a manner that allocates and coordinates industry
   resources and produces the greatest return for communications
   companies.

   ATIS is accredited by the American National Standards Institute
   (ANSI).

3.2.1.  ATIS SON (Service Oriented Networks) Forum.

   The SON Forum is addressing work to enable the interoperability and
   implementation of Service Oriented Network (SON) applications and
   services by developing standards, providing coordination for the
   development of standards and practices, and facilitating related
   technical activities.  This forum is placing an emphasis on
   telecommunications industry needs in collaboration with regional and
   international standards development programs in the
   telecommunications, IT and Web industries.

   ATIS has three Working Areas:

   o  WORK AREA1:Policy and Data Models Work Area (PDM)

   o  WORK AREA2:OSS/BSS and Virtualization Work Area (OBV)

   o  WORK AREA3:Service Delivery Creation and Enablers Work Area (SDCE)

3.2.2.  ATIS CSF (Cloud Services Forum).

   The ATIS Board recently approved the launch of the Cloud Services
   Forum (CSF).  The Forum will focus, among other things, on the
   operators' provision of cloud services, and develop a framework to
   ensure integration of the network and IT.  It will account for basic
   APIs in the control plane layer of the network rather than as a
   service on the network, define a minimum set of APIs to expose
   between service providers, and define interoperability, security, and
   standardization, among other things, between service provider clouds.

   Drawing upon business use cases that leverage Cloud Services'
   potential, the Forum will address industry priorities and develop
   implementable solutions for the evolving Cloud marketplace.
   Ultimately, the CSF will work to see that Cloud capabilities are
   quickly operationalized and operators are able to offer managed
   services.

   Initial CSF objectives that are being discussed include:

   o  Cloud Service Framework for CDN;

   o  Developing a framework to ensure the integration of the network
      and IT;

   o  Ascertaining basic APIs in the control plane layer of the network;

   o  Using industry input to define a minimum set of APIs to expose
      between service providers; and

   o  Utilizing control plane layer interfaces to allow for a greater
      network role.

3.12.  DELTA Cloud

   Deltacloud is a top-level project at the Apache Software Foundation
   (ASF), having graduated from the ASF Incubator in October 2011.
   Through a collaborative and meritocratic development process, Apache
   projects deliver enterprise-grade, freely available software products
   that attract large communities of users.

   Apache Deltacloud is a REST-based (HATEOAS) cloud abstraction API,
   that enables management of resources in different IaaS clouds using a
   single API.  A series of back-end drivers 'speak' each cloud
   provider's native API and the Deltacloud Core Framework provides the
   basis for implementing drivers as needed for other/new IaaS cloud
   providers.  Apache Deltacloud currently supports many back-end cloud
   providers, as listed in Drivers.

   The Apache Deltacloud project empowers its users in avoiding lockin
   to any single cloud provider.  Deltacloud provides an API abstraction
   that can be implemented as a wrapper around a large number of clouds,
   freeing users of cloud from dealing with the particulars of each
   cloud's API.

   Delta Cloud provides:

   o  A RESTful API for simple, any-platform access

   o  Support for all major cloud service providers

   o  Backward compatibility across versions, providing long-term
      stability for scripts, tools and applications

   standards.

   Virtualization Management(VMAN) Initiative: VMAN unleashes the power
   of virtualization by delivering broadly supported interoperability
   and portability standards to virtual computing environments.  As
   another initiative based on the CIM and WBEM standards, the suite of
   management standards helps IT managers deploy virtual computer
   systems, discover/inventory virtual computer systems, manage the
   lifecycle of virtual computer systems, create/modify/delete virtual
   resources and monitor virtual systems for health and performance.
   The VMAN initiative strives to promote standards for virtualization
   management within the industry and enable vendors to implement
   compliant, interoperable virtualization management solutions.

   DMTF's Open Cloud Standards Incubator will focus on standardizing
   interactions between cloud environments by developing cloud resource
   management protocols, packaging formats and security mechanisms to
   facilitate interoperability.

   The Open Cloud Standards Incubator addresses the following aspects of
   the lifecycle of a cloud service:

   o  offering of the service to consumers

   o  consumer entrance into contracts for the offering

   o  provider operation and management of instances of the service

   o  removal of the service offering

   A DMTF partner initiative, SMI is a Storage Networking Industry
   Association (SNIA) initiative to standardize interoperable storage
   management technologies, based on the rich foundation provided by the
   DMTF's CIM and WBEM specifications.

3.13.1.  CMWG (Cloud Managenment Working Group)

   Using the recommendations developed by DMTF's Open Cloud Standards
   Incubator, the Cloud Managenment Working Group (CMWG) is focused on
   standardizing interactions between cloud environments by developing
   specifications that deliver architectural semantics and
   implementation details to achieve interoperable cloud management
   between service prociders and their consumers and developers.

   DSP0263 Cloud Infrastructure Management Interface (CIMI) Model and
   REST Interface over HTTP is an Interface for Managing Cloud
   Infrastructure.  This profile defines a logical model for the
   management of resources within the Infrastructure as a Service
   domain.  A model was developed to address the use cases outlined in
   the !oScoping Framework for Cloud Management Models and Protocol
   Requirements!+/- document.

   The most recent version of DSP4003 v1.3.0 (the Alliance Partner Work
   Register Process document) approved by the DMTF board of directors on
   June 8th, 2006 defines how an alliance partner work register is
   created and the sequence of steps that are required before a work
   register is approved and the alliance partnership is established.

3.13.2.  SVPC(System Virtualization, Partitioning, and Clustering)

   DMTF's SVPC includes a set of specifications that address the
   management lifecycle of a virtual environment.  SVPC's OVF (Open
   Virtualization Format) specification provides a standard format for
   packaging and describing virtual machines and applications for
   deployment across heterogeneous virtualization platforms.  SVPC's
   profiles standardize many aspects of the operational management of a
   heterogeneous virtualized environment.

   OVF is a common packaging format for independent software vendors
   (ISVs) to package and securely distribute virtual appliances,
   enabling cross-platform portability.  By packaging virtual appliances
   in OVF, ISVs can create a single, pre-packaged appliance that can run
   on customers' virtualization platforms of choice.

   The key properties of the format are as follows:

   o  Optimized for distribution

   ETSI's Grid Technical Committee (TC GRID) is addressing issues
   associated with the convergence of Information Technology (IT) and
   telecommunications, paying particular attention to scenarios where
   connectivity goes beyond the local network.  This includes not only
   Grid computing but also the emerging commercial trend towards Cloud
   computing which places particular emphasis on ubiquitous network
   access to scalable computing and storage resources.  The vision is to
   evolve towards a coherent and consistent general purpose
   infrastructure, made up of interoperable elements ranging from small
   devices up to supercomputers, connected by global networks and
   capable of supporting communities ranging from individuals to whole
   industries, and with applications in business, public sector,
   academic and consumer environments.

   Note: TC GRID will be renamed to TC Cloud shortly and start work on
   standardization requirements for cloud services (ETSI TR 102 997)

   The Working Group (WG) will have three primary tasks.

   First, the WG will identify target applications to appropriately
   scope the problem and requirements.  P2P applications are the primary
   target, but suitability to other applications with similar
   requirements may be considered depending on additional complexity
   required to support such applications.

   Second, the WG will identify the requirements to enable target

   applications to utilize in-network storage.  Requirements will
   include the ability for an application to (1) store, retrieve, and
   manage data, (2) indicate access control policies for storing and
   retrieving data suitable to an environment with users across multiple
   administrative and security domains (e.g., in a P2P environment), and
   (3) indicate resource control policies for storing and retrieving
   data.

   Third, the WG will develop an architecture within which the DECADE
   protocol can be specified.  This architecture will identify DECADE's
   relationship to existing IETF protocols and where (if any) new
   protocol is needed or extensions to existing protocols need to be
   made.

   The architecture will not specify a protocol or extension; if
   development of a new protocol is needed, the WG will seek to
   recharter for this purpose or might ask an existing WG to work on
   such extensions.

   The architecture will not specify a protocol or extension; if
   development of a new protocol is needed, the WG will seek to
   recharter for this purpose or might ask an existing WG to work on
   such extensions.

   The WG will focus on the following work items:

   o  A "problem statement" document.  This document provides a
      description of the problem and common terminology.

   o  A requirements document.  This document lists the requirements for
      the in-network storage service (e.g., supported operations) and
      the protocol to support it.  The service will include storing,
      retrieving, and managing data as well as specifying both access
      control and resource control policies in the in-network storage
      pertaining to that data.

   o  A survey document.  This document will survey existing related
      mechanisms and protocols (e.g., HTTP, NFS, and WebDAV), and
      evaluate their applicability to DECADE.

   o  An architecture document.  This document will identify DECADE's
      relationship with existing IETF protocols.  Existing protocols
      will be used wherever possible and appropriate to support DECADE's
      requirements.  In particular, data storage, retrieval, and
      management may be provided by an existing IETF protocols.  The WG
      will not limit itself to a single data transport protocol since
      different protocols may have varying implementation costs and
      performance tradeoffs.

   However, to keep interoperability manageable, a small number of
   specific, targeted, data transport protocols will be identified and
   used.  If new protocol development is deemed necessary, the WG will
   be rechartered.  It is not expected that all work items will be ready
   for IESG review by that point, but WG consensus must show that
   documents directing eventual protocol development (Requirements and
   Architecture document) have stabilized.  This permits adjustments to
   such documents as necessary to maintain consistency as protocol
   development is done.

   The following issues are considered out-of-scope for the WG:

   o  Specification of policies regarding copyright-protected or illegal
      content.

   o  Locating the "best" in-network storage location from which to
      retrieve content if there are more than one location can provide
      the same content.

   o  Developing a new protocol for data transport between P2P
      applications and in-network storage.

      configuration data and non-configuration data

   o  Is extensible enough so that vendors will provide access to all
      configuration data on the device using a single protocol

   o  Has a programmatic interface (avoids screen scraping and
      formatting-related changes between releases)

   o  Uses a textual data representation, that can be easily manipulated
      using non-specialized text manipulation tools

   o  Supports integration with existing user authentication methods

   o  Supports integration with existing configuration database systems

   o  Supports network wide configuration transactions (with features
      such as locking and rollback capability)

   o  Is as transport-independent as possible

   o  Provides support for asynchronous notifications

   The NETCONF protocol is using XML for data encoding purposes, because
   XML is a widely deployed standard which is supported by a large
   number of applications.

   The NETCONF protocol should be independent of the data definition
   language and data models used to describe configuration and state
   data.

   application overlays, performing routing and peer selection
   decisions, managing traffic and discovering resources.  Areas of
   interest are also new techniques for P2P streaming and
   interconnecting distinct P2P application overlays.  Other challenges
   for P2P are related to storage, reliability, and information
   retrieval in P2P systems.  Yet another challenging area is security,
   privacy, anonymity and trust.  Finally, it is challenging to examine

3.29.  NIST

   NIST's role in cloud computing is to promote the effective and secure
   use of the technology within government and industry by providing
   technical guidance and promoting standards.

   Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network
   access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g.,
   networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be
   rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or
   service provider interaction.

   Essential Characteristics:

   o  On-demand self-service.  A consumer can unilaterally provision
      computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage,
      as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with
      each service's provider.

   o  Broad network access.  Capabilities are available over the network
      and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by
      heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones,
      laptops, and PDAs).

   o  Resource pooling.  The provider's computing resources are pooled
      to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with
      different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and
      reassigned according to consumer demand.  There is a sense of
      location independence in that the customer generally has no
      control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided
      resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of
      abstraction (e.g., country, state, or datacenter).  Examples of
      resources include storage, processing, memory, network bandwidth,
      and virtual machines.

   o  Rapid elasticity.  Capabilities can be rapidly and elastically
      provisioned, in some cases automatically, to quickly scale out and
      rapidly released to quickly scale in.  To the consumer, the
      capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be
      unlimited and can be purchased in any quantity at any time.

   o  Measured Service.  Cloud systems automatically control and
      optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some
      level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g.,

   ODCA established technical workgroups in five categories that cover
   essential areas of cloud computing:

   o  Infrastructure: Related to core infrastructure of a cloud,
      including cloud data centers, access devices, and platforms.  Use
      cases will span compute, storage, network, and facilities.

   o  Management: Related to effective management of the cloud and cloud
      services to meet cloud subscriber, cloud provider, end user, and
      intermediary objectives.

   o  Regulation and Ecosystem: Use cases and patterns where government
      regulations help or hinder cloud adoption.  Also included are
      ecosystem practices that impede cloud models and/or render the
      models inefficient (for example, licensing).

   o  Security: Use cases that highlight security needs of the cloud,
      particularly where significant user concerns limit adoption.

   o  Services: Related to the kinds of cloud services and ways they
      might be used.  This category is driven by dominant and emerging
      business models in the cloud.

3.33.  OGF / OCCI

   OGF is an open community committed to driving the rapid evolution and
   adoption of applied distributed computing.  Applied Distributed
   Computing is critical to developing new, innovative and scalable
   applications and infrastructures that are essential to productivity
   in the enterprise and within the science community.  OGF accomplishes
   its work through open forums that build the community, explore
   trends, share best practices and consolidate these best practices
   into standards.

   The purpose of the OCCI group is the creation of a practical solution
   to interface with Cloud infrastructures exposed as a service (IaaS).
   It will focus on a solution which covers the provisioning, monitoring
   and definition of Cloud Infrastructure services.  The group should
   create this API in an agile way as we can have advantages over other
   groups if we deliver fast.  Overlapping work and efforts will be
   contributed and synchronized with other groups.

   OCCI is a RESTful-based network Protocol and API for managing cloud
   computing infrastructure.  It has since evolved into an extensible
   API with a strong focus on interoperability while still offering a
   high degree of extensibility.  The current release of the OCCI is
   suitable to serve many other models in addition to IaaS, including
   e.g.  PaaS and SaaS.

   OCCI are described from three aspects.

   o  OCCI Core Mode.

      *  Core Mode defines a representation of resource types which is
         an abstraction of real-world resources, including the means to
         identify, classify, associate and extend those resources.

      *  Any resource exposed through OCCI is a Resource or a sub-type
         thereof.  The Resource type contains a number of common
         attributes that Resource sub-types inherit.  The Resource type
         is complemented by the Link type which associates one Resource
         instance with another.  The Link type contains a number of
         common attributes that Link sub-types inherit.

      *  OCCI Core Model types include Category, Kind, Mixin, Action,
         Entity, Resource and Link.

   o  OCCI Rendering.

      *  OCCI Rendering types include HTTP Header, XHTML5, etc.

Internet-Draft  Cloud SDO Activities Survey and Analysis   December 2011


      *  OCCI Rendering is a lightweight yet all-encompassing means to
         describe infrastructure.

      *  It provides the capability to send a native (e.g.  OVF, VMX)
         representation for clients that can digest such a native
         rendering.

   o  OCCI Infrastructure Model

      *  OCCI Infrastructure Model describes a particular OCCI
         Infrastructure extension for the IaaS domain.

      *  The main infrastructure types defined within OCCI
         Infrastructure are:

         +  Compute.  Information processing resources.

         +  Network.  Interconnection resource and represents a L2
            networking resource.

         +  Storage.  Information recording resources.

      *  Link sub-types for the Resource types are the following:

         +  NetworkInterface connects a Compute instance to a Network
            instance.

         +  StorageLink connects a Compute instance to a Storage
            instance.

   The OCC also manages testbeds for cloud computing, such as the Open
   Cloud Testbed, and operates clouds computing infrastructure to
   support scientific research, such as the Open Science Data Cloud.

   OMA has developed OMA Cloud Computing White Paper v1.0 which
   identifies the following areas of interest as potential future
   developments opportunities:

   1.  The development and support of Cloud Computing related O&M
       functionality with OMA enablers.

   2.  To extend the OMA Mobile Commerce and Charging area.

   3.  To evaluate the need of developing new activities/work item to
       enable the 'Virtualized Experience' in Cloud Computing.  OMA has
       established a new work item namely 'Unified Virtual Experience'
       i.e. use cases and requirements for Unified Virtual Experience
       (UVE) Enabler.

   4.  To extend the OMA Security area.

   Recently OMA is continuing extension of OMA Cloud Computing White
   Paper v1.0, i.e. the study of how OMA enablers need to be modified to
   be useful in the Cloud Computing environment.  The scope of this new
   version v2.0 focuses on:

   o  More detailed gap analysis with other SDOs and start a dialogue/
      collaboration with them.

   o  More gap analysis on other OMA areas, e.g.:

      *  Person-to-Person Communication area.

      *  Service Customization area.

      *  End-to-end Efficiency aspect.

   o  More recommendations of the future work in OMA.

   The goals of such analysis and recommendation in this White Paper
   are:

   o  to consider a cloud delivery model as a converged platform to
      deliver IT and communication services over any network (fixed,
      mobile,..) and used by any end user connected devices (PC, TV,
      Smart Phone, M2M!).

   o  to facilitate the operators to deliver a rich set of communication
      services (voice & video call, audio, video & web conf, messaging,
      unified communication, content creation, broadcasting...).
      Moreover the network services should be seen as smart pipes
      !ohigh-grade network!+/- for cloud services transport and cloud
      interconnection (inter-cloud) in order to guarantee secure and
      high performance end-to-end quality of service QoS for end users
      (considered as an important key differentiator for
      telecommunication players).

   that is placed in them.  In addition, metadata can be set on
   containers and their contained data elements through this interface.

   This interface is also used by administrative and management
   applications to manage containers, accounts, security access and
   monitoring/billing information, even for storage that is accessible
   by other protocols.  The capabilities of the underlying storage and
   data services are exposed so that clients can understand the
   offering.

   Metadata is a convenient mechanism in managing large amounts of data
   with differing requirements through expressing those requirements in
   such a way that underlying data services differentiate their
   treatment of the data to meet those requirements.

   Resource types which are accessed through RESTful interface include:

   XML-based, messaging-based interface designed to support the specific
   requirements of managing devices in and through SANs.

   The eXtensible Access Method (XAM) Interface specification defines a
   standard access method (API) between "Consumers" (application and

   sellers who will collaborate to define a range of common approaches,
   processes, metrics and other key service enablers.

   TM Forum's vision is to ensure acceleration of service
   standardization and commoditization in an effective and efficient
   marketplace of cloud computing services in all global geographies,
   through alignment with the needs of the world's largest IT buyers.

   Enterprise Cloud Buyers Council Goals are:

   o  to foster an effective and efficient marketplace for cloud compute
      infrastructure and services across all industry verticals and
      global geographies;

   o  Accelerate standardization and commoditization of cloud services,
      and identifying common commodity processes best consumed as a
      service;

   o  Solicit definition for standardized core and industry-specific
      SKUs for cloud services;

   o  Achieve transparency of cost, service levels and reporting across
      the ecosystem;

   o  Enable benchmarking of services across service providers and
      geographies;

   o  Enable vendor measurement against normalized and agreed service
      level metrics;

   o  Radically reduce cost of acquisition and operations for commodity
      compute & services.

4.  Summary and Analysis

   This survey shows that there are a variety of ways to virtualize
   computing and communication resources in order to support both
   client-side and server-side applications and services.  Many of these
   services tend to utilize resources across multiple administrative,
   technology, and geographical domains.  Since there is no unified and
   universally acceptable protocol and mechanism to define the mobility
   of resources across domains, the early implementers tend to utilize
   the features and functions of the existing IETF protocols along with
   their proprietary modifications or extensions in order to achieve
   their goals.

   In addition to using a virtualization layer (VM layer), a thin Cloud
   operating system (OS) layer may be useful to hide the complexity,
   specificity, and regionality (locality) of the resources.

   We also observe that different SDOs are trying to develop many
   different methods for logging and reporting of resource usage for
   Cloud services.  This will create auditing transparency problems
   which may negatively impact the development of security and service
   level agreement features.

   At the end, these may in fact result in an increase in the effective
   cost for services that utilize the cloud based systems and networks,
   violating the very foundation on which the concept of utilizing cloud
   is based on.

6.  Conclusion

   We have presented a survey of the activities of Cloud SDOs along with
   a simple early analysis.  This survey has revealed that different
   SDOs are utilizing or expect to utilize a set of common IETF
   protocols for cloud services, and some time they modify or extend
   these protocols in order to satisfy their niche objectives.

   These will not only cause interoperability problems, but may also
   negatively impact further development of protocols and services in
   this very important area of cloud computing and networking.  IETF is
   the best organization to address these issues.
