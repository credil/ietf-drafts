  Routing Extensions for Discovery of Role-based MPLS Label Switching
       Router (MPLS LSR) Traffic Engineering (TE) Mesh Membership
                 draft-li-ccamp-role-based-automesh-00

Abstract

   A Traffic Engnieering (TE) mesh-group is defined as a group of Label
   Switch Routers (LSRs) that are connected by a full mesh of TE LSPs.
   Routing (OSPF and IS-IS) extensions for discovery Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) LSR TE mesh membership has been defined to automate
   the creation of mesh of TE LSPs.

   This document introduces a role-based TE mesh-group that applies to
   the scenarios where full mesh TE LSPs are not necessary and TE LSPs
   setup depends on the roles of LSRs in a TE mesh-group.  Interior
   Gateway Protocol (IGP) routing extensions for automatic discovery of
   role-based TE mesh membership are defined accordingly.

Internet-Draft          Role-based  Auto-mesh TE           February 2013


1.  Introduction

   A TE mesh-group [RFC4972] is defined as a group of LSRs that are
   connected by a full mesh of TE LSPs.  [RFC4972] specifies
   Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) and Open Shortest
   Path First (OSPF) extensions to provide an automatic discovery of the
   set of LSR members of a TE mesh-group in order to automate the
   creation of such mesh of TE LSPs.  This is called "auto-mesh TE" or
   "auto-mesh".  The auto-mesh TE largely simplifies the configurations
   and deployments of TE LSPs.

   In some scenarios, it may not necessary to establish full mesh TE
   LSPs among all the LSRs of a TE mesh-group.  An example of the
   scenarios is the mobile backhaul networks, TE LSPs are normally setup
   between the Cell Site Gateways(CSGs) and the Radio Network Controller
   (RNC) Site Gateways(RSGs).  TE LSPs between/among CSGs and TE LSPs
   between RSGs are not necessary.  And normally, the amount of CSGs is
   very large in the real deployments, with the auto-mesh mechanism
   defined[RFC4972], full mesh TE LSPs will be established among the
   CSGs and RSGs, this will result in large amount of unnecessary TE
   LSPs established among CSGs and between RSGs.  This may not be scale
   for the CSG devices and is waste of network resources.

   So, there are requirements to optimize the auto-mesh TE hence to
   reduce the unnecessary TE LSPs.  This document introduces a "role-
   based auto-mesh TE" or "role-based auto-mesh" where the setup of the
   TE LSPs are dependent on the roles of the LSRs within a TE mesh-
   group.  Therefore, besides the discovery of the membership of a TE
   mesh-group, it needs to discover the role of each node in the TE
   mesh-group.

   Another scenario to which the role-based auto-mesh TE can apply is
   the Resource Reservation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)
   Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) TE LSP[RFC4875] scenario.  For a RSVP-TE
   P2MP TE LSP, the root LSR has to know all the leaf LSRs before
   signaling the P2MP TE LSP.  The automatic discovery mechanisms
   defined in this document can be used to discover the leaf LSRs for
   P2MP TE LSPs.

   This document defines IGP routing extensions to automatically
   discover of the members and their roles of a TE mesh-group.


2.  Role-based TE Mesh Group

   A role-based TE mesh-group is a special TE mesh-group where TE LSPs
   will not be established among all member LSRs.  LSRs in a role-based
   TE mesh-group will have different roles.  The TE LSPs setup depends

   on the roles of the LSRs in a TE mesh-group.  This document
   introduces two types of roles: Hub-Spoke LSRs, and Root-Leaf LSRs.
   So there would be Hub-Spoke TE mesh-group and Root-Leaf TE mesh-
   group.

   For a Hub-Spoke TE mesh-group, an LSR can be either a Hub or Spoke
   LSR in a group, but cannot be both.  The rules for Hub-Spoke TE mesh-
   group are as follows:

   TE LSPs SHOULD only be setup between Spoke and Hub LSR.

   TE LSPs MUST NOT be setup between/among Spoke LSRs.

   TE LSPs MUST NOT be setup between/among Hub LSRs.

   For a Root-Leaf TE mesh-group, an LSR can be a Root, a Leaf or both a
   Root and Leaf LSR.  Once the membership and roles are determined, the
   root LSRs can signal the P2MP TE LSPs toward all the Leaf LSRs.
   There may be multiple P2MP TE LSPs within a TE mesh-group.

   How to signal the TE LSPs is out the scope of this document.


3.  Role-based TE-MESH-GROUP TLV Formats

3.1.  OSPF Role-based TE-MESH-GROUP TLV Format

   The OSPF Role-based TE-MESH-GROUP TLV is used to advertise that an
   LSR joins/leaves a TE mesh-group and the role of the LSR in the TE
   mesh-group.  The OSPF Role-based TE-MESH-GROUP TLV format for IPv4
   (Figure 2) and IPv6 (Figure 3) is as follows:

   The Type of OSPF TE-MESH-GROUP TLV for IPv4 is TBD1, the value of the
   Length is variable.

   The Type of OSPF TE-MESH-GROUP TLV for IPv6 is TBD2, the value of the
   Length is variable.

   The OSPF Role-based TE-MESH-GROUP TLV may contain one or more role-
   based mesh-group entries.  And each entry corresponds to a TE mesh-
   group.  The definition of the mesh-group-number, the Tail-end
   address, the Name length and the Tail-end name in each role-based
   mesh group entry is the same as that of OSPF TE-MESH-GROUP TLV
   defined in [RFC4972].

   In addition, for each mesh group entry, an four-octet flag field is
   introduced and three flags are defined in this document.  Other bits
   are reserved for future use and MUST be set to zero when sent, and

          Figure 5 - IS-IS TE-MESH-GROUP sub-TLV format (IPv6 Address)

   The Type of IS-IS TE-MESH-GROUP sub-TLV for IPv4 is TBD3, the value
   of the Length is variable.

   The Type of IS-IS TE-MESH-GROUP sub-TLV for IPv6 is TBD4, the value
   of the Length is variable.

   The IS-IS Role-based TE-MESH-GROUP sub-TLV may contain one or more
   role-based mesh-group entries.  And each entry corresponds to a TE
   mesh-group.  The definition of the fields, mesh-group-number, Tail-
   end address, Name length and Tail-end name in each role-based mesh
   group entry is the same as that of IS-IS TE-MESH-GROUP sub-TLV
   defined in [RFC4972].

   The H, R and L bits are defined as in Section 3.1 of this document.

4.  Elements of Procedure

   The OSPF Role-based TE-MESH-GROUP TLV is carried within the OSPF
   Routing Information LSA and the IS-IS Role-based TE-MESH-GROUP sub-
   TLV is carried within the IS-IS Router capability TLV.  As such,
   elements of procedure are inherited from those defined in [RFC4970]
   and [RFC4971] for OSPF and IS-IS respectively.  Specifically, a
   router MUST originate a new LSA/LSP whenever the content of this
   information changes, or whenever required by regular routing
   procedure (e.g., updates).

   The Role-based TE-MESH-GROUP TLV is OPTIONAL and MUST NOT include
   more than one of each of the IPv4 instances or the IPv6 instance.  If
   either the IPv4 or the IPv6 OSPF Role-based TE-MESH-GROUP TLV occurs
   more than once within the OSPF Router Information LSA, only the first
   instance is processed, subsequent TLV(s) SHOULD be silently ignored.
   Similarly, if either the IPv4 or the IPv6 IS-IS Role-based TE-MESH-
   GROUP sub-TLV occurs more than once within the IS-IS Router
   capability TLV, only the first instance is processed, subsequent
   TLV(s) SHOULD be silently ignored.

4.1.  OSPF

   The Role-based TE-MESH-GROUP TLV is advertised within an OSPF Router
   Information opaque LSA (opaque type of 4, opaque ID of 0) for OSPFv2
   [RFC2328] and within a new LSA (Router Information LSA) for OSPFv3
   [RFC5340].  The Router Information LSAs for OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 are
   defined in [RFC4970].

   A router MUST originate a new OSPF router information LSA whenever
   the content of any of the advertised TLV changes or whenever required
   by the regular OSPF procedure (LSA update (every LSRefreshTime)).  If
   an LSR desires to join or leave a particular TE mesh group or an LSR
   desires to change its role in a mesh group, it MUST originate a new
   OSPF Router Information LSA comprising the updated Role-based TE-
   MESH-GROUP TLV.  In the case of a join, a new entry will be added to
   the role-based TE-MESH-GROUP TLV; if the LSR leaves a mesh-group, the
   corresponding entry will be removed from the role-based TE-MESH-GROUP
   TLV; if the LSR changes its role in the mesh group, the corresponding
   entry will be updated in the role-based TE-MESH-GROUP TLV.  Note that
   these operations can be performed in the context of a single LSA
   update.  An implementation SHOULD be able to detect any change to a
   previously received role-based TE-MESH-GROUP TLV from a specific LSR.

   As defined in [RFC5250] for OSPVv2 and in [RFC5340] for OSPFv3, the
   flooding scope of the Router Information LSA is determined by the LSA
   Opaque type for OSPFv2 and the values of the S1/S2 bits for OSPFv3.

Internet-Draft          Role-based  Auto-mesh TE           February 2013


   For OSPFv2 Router Information opaque LSA:

   - Link-local scope: type 9;

   - Area-local scope: type 10;

   - Routing-domain scope: type 11.  In this case, the flooding scope is
   equivalent to the Type 5 LSA flooding scope.

   For OSPFv3 Router Information LSA:

   - Link-local scope: OSPFv3 Router Information LSA with the S1 and S2
   bits cleared;

   - Area-local scope: OSPFv3 Router Information LSA with the S1 bit set
   and the S2 bit cleared;

   - Routing-domain scope: OSPFv3 Router Information LSA with S1 bit
   cleared and the S2 bit set.

   A router may generate multiple OSPF Router Information LSAs with
   different flooding scopes.

   The Role-based TE-MESH-GROUP TLV may be advertised within an Area-
   local or Routing-domain scope Router Information LSA, depending on
   the MPLS TE mesh group profile:

   - If the MPLS TE mesh-group is contained within a single area (all
   the LSRs of the mesh-group are contained within a single area), the
   Role-based TE-MESH-GROUP TLV MUST be generated within an Area-local
   Router Information LSA.

   - If the MPLS TE mesh-group spans multiple OSPF areas, the TE Role-
   based mesh- group TLV MUST be generated within a Routing-domain scope
   router information LSA.

   When the router receives Role-based TE-MESH-GROUP TLV, it SHOULD
   setup MPLS TE LSPs according rules which defined in the Section 3.

4.2.  IS-IS

   The Role-based TE-MESH-GROUP sub-TLV is advertised within the IS-IS
   Router CAPABILITY TLV defined in [RFC4971].

   An IS-IS router MUST originate a new IS-IS LSP whenever the content
   of any of the advertised sub-TLV changes or whenever required by
   regular IS-IS procedure (LSP updates).  If an LSR desires to join or
   leave a particular TE mesh group or an LSR desires to change its role

Internet-Draft          Role-based  Auto-mesh TE           February 2013


   in a mesh group, it MUST originate a new LSP comprising the refreshed
   IS-IS Router capability TLV comprising the updated TE-MESH-GROUP sub-
   TLV.  In the case of a join, a new entry will be added to the TE-
   MESH-GROUP sub-TLV; if the LSR leaves a mesh-group, the corresponding
   entry will be deleted from the TE-MESH-GROUP sub-TLV; if the LSR
   changes its role in the mesh group, the corresponding entry will be
   updated in the role-based TE-MESH-GROUP sub-TLV.  Note that these
   operations can be performed in the context of a single update.  An
   implementation SHOULD be able to detect any change to a previously
   received TE-MESH-GROUP sub-TLV from a specific LSR.

   If the flooding scope of a Role-based TE-MESH-GROUP sub-TLV is
   limited to an IS-IS level/area, the sub-TLV MUST NOT be leaked across
   level/area and the S flag of the Router CAPABILITY TLV MUST be
   cleared.  Conversely, if the flooding scope of a Role-based TE-MESH-
   GROUP sub-TLV is the entire routing domain, the TLV MUST be leaked
   across IS-IS levels/areas, and the S flag of the Router CAPABILITY
   TLV MUST be set.  In both cases, the flooding rules specified in
   [RFC4971] apply.

   As specified in [RFC4971], a router may generate multiple IS-IS
   Router CAPABILITY TLVs within an IS-IS LSP with different flooding
   scopes.

   When the router receives Role-based TE-MESH-GROUP sub-TLV, it SHOULD
   setup MPLS TE LSPs according rules which defined in the Section 3.


5.  Backward Compatibility

   For a role-based TE mesh-group, if there are some LSRs only
   supporting mechanisms defined [RFC4972], all the LSRs of the mesh-
   group MUST process as defined in [RFC4972].  The operators should
   avoid to add an LSR that does not support role-based auto-mesh TE to
   a role-based TE mesh-group.


6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  OSPF

   The registry for the Router Information LSA is defined in [RFC4970].
   IANA assigned a new OSPF TLV code-point for the Role-based TE-MESH-
   GROUP TLVs carried within the Router Information LSA.
