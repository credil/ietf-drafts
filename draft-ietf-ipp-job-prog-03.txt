This document defines four new Job Description attributes for
monitoring job progress to be registered as OPTIONAL extensions to the
Internet Printing Protocol (IPP/1.0 and IPP/1.1).  These attributes
are drawn from the PWG Job Monitoring MIB.  This document also defines
a new "sheet-collate" Job Template attribute to control sheet
collation and to help with the interpretation of the job progress
attributes.
