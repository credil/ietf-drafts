Abstract

   While Virtual Machine (VM) lively migrate around, not only the OS,
   memory, and the states on Hypervisor need to be migrated with VM, but
   also the states on the network side, e.g. on Firewall.  Otherwise,
   the running services on the migrated VM could be disrupted, even
   stopped, In this draft, we describe the background and use cases of
   this proposal.  We also raise a clear scope for the proposal.

Internet-Draft               State Migration                October 2011


1.  Introduction

   VM live Migration enable us to migrate a VM from one place to another
   place without significant interruption to the running service on the
   VM.  VMware lists some benefits that VMotion, VMware's VM live
   migration solution, can provide:

   vMotion allows you to[VMotion]:

      Perform live migrations with zero downtime, undetectable to the
      user.

      Continuously and automatically optimize virtual machines within
      resource pools.

      Perform hardware maintenance without scheduling downtime and
      disrupting business operations.

      Proactively move virtual machines away from failing or
      underperforming servers.

   VM Live Migration is a wonderful function to have for DC operators.
   However, some preconditions must be satisfied in order to make a
   successful live migration.  One of the preconditions is that the
   flow-coupled state on network must be kept after VM migrates.  A very
   obvious example of flow-coupled state is session table on Firewall.
   Assume that a VM migrates to a new place, which is under different
   Firewall from the original Firewall.  If the session table, which
   records the existing connections to the VM, is lost, the following
   packets belonging to the existing connections will be dropped by the
   new Firewall, and the connections will finally be disconnected.

   In the following sections, we will give more detail description of
   the problem with flow-coupled state in VM live migration.  And we
   will conclude a feasible scope for further effort in IETF.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Source Network Device, Source switch, or Source device: the network
   device/switch/device from where the VM migrates.  I.E. VM is
   originally located under the source network device/switch/device.

   Destination Network Device, Destination switch, or Destination

   device: the network device/switch/device to where the VM migrates.
   I.E. VM is relocated to the destination network device/switch/device.

   Virtual Machine (VM), A completely isolated operation system which is
   installed by software on a normal operation system.  An normal
   operation system can be virtualized into several VM.

   Firewall (FW), A policy based security device, typically used for
   restricting access to/from specific devices and applications.


3.  States On Firewalls

   There are two kinds of physical Firewall deployment in DCs.

      One is to place a pair of centralized powerful Firewalls at WAN
      connect point.  In this case, any traffic, even the traffic
      between VMs within the same LAN, need to pass the Firewall.

      The third way is distributed deployed Firewall.  In stead of place
      a powerful centralized Firewall at the WAN connect point, Firewall
      is distributedly deployed at aggregation switches, even lower on
      access switches.  The goal of this kind of distributed deployed
      Firewall is not to separate different security zones, but to off
      load the huge workload on centralized Firewall.  This case is
      especially reasonable for large layer 2 network with tens even
      hundreds of thousands of Virtual Machines.  To rely a centralized
      pair of Firewall to deal with traffic from such volume of VMs are
      not reliable and Firewall could be the bottleneck.

   The following states are dynamically generated on Firewall.

3.1.  Session Table

   Firewall will establish session state for each connection to host
   within the DC.  The host could a physical server or a VM.  The
   session state includes most related information of the connection.

   +-------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

3.2.  Cumulative Data

   In order to protect DC from attacks, Firewall will cumulate various
   kinds of data.  Assuming a use case, where there are both individual
   clients and enterprise servers in the DC.  An untrust client might
   attack the servers in the same DC.  One example of attacks is SYN
   Flooding.  The client keeps sending SYN message to a specific server,
   which will be a DOS attack to the server, or to any server, which
   will become a DOS attack to the Firewall.  Firewall cumulate the SYN
   message from a client.  If the frequency of SYN message exceed a pre-
   defined rate, the IP address of this client will be drawn into a
   black list.  Same situation to DNS Flooding attack.


4.  Scenarios for Migration of States on Firewall

   The following are scenarios that we need to migrate Firewall states
   with VM when proceed VM live migration.

4.1.  VM Migration between different DCs

   China Telecom deploys several separated DCs in one province in West
   China.  These DCs have been built for several years and been upgraded
   during these years.  But any single DC is limited in scale because
   most of the DCs are built in downtown.  When facing with the
   requirements from large Service Provider, none of any single DC can
   accommodate the huge requirements for racks of servers by itself.  So
   China Telecom has to split SP's requirements into multiple DCs.
   Interconnection between DCs must be provided to simulate a single DC,
   which is in order to enable inter-communication among the SP's VMs
   and to enable VM live migration.

   Here we provide an example architecture of above situation.  A DC
   provider has two DCs on different locations.  One is at City A and
   the other is at City B, which is 30 kilometers away form City A. We
   assume that the physical distance and network bandwidth between City
   A and B satisfy the requirements of VM live migration.  Two DCs are
   interconnected by VPLS to make them in the same LAN.  Each DC has a
   pair of Firewalls on Core Switch.  VRRP(Virtual Router Redundancy
   Protocol) [VRRP]is deployed on GW1 and GW1'.

   At the very beginning, VMs are evenly created on Pod1 and Pod2.  With
   time past, Pod1 and Pod2 becomes overloaded.  In order to guarantee
   SLA, and to accommodate more service, Pod3 is created and some of the

   VMs on Pod1 and Pod2 are migrated to Pod3, and the running service
   must be kept during the migration.

4.2.  VM Migration under Distributed Deployed Firewalls

   In a DC with distributed deployed Firewalls on Aggregation Switches,
   an enterprise customer lease hundreds of physical servers, and each
   physical server carries 10 plus Virtual Machines (VM).  The VMs
   provide VDI service to employees.  At day time, the VMs are evenly
   deployed on each Pod3.

   While at night, most of the VMs are shut down.  Only a few VMs still
   working.  In order to save energy, the active VMs are migrated to a
   few physical servers and the source physical servers, on which the
   migrated VM used to run, are shut down.  The states on FW1' need to
   be migrated to FW1, otherwise the running service on migrating VM
   will be disrupted.

                     Figure 5: VM and State migration


5.  Scope

   SAMI (StAte MIgration) only considers the scenarios in which network
   conditions can satisfy the requirements raised by VM live migration.
   No matter VM is migrated within or between DCs, the scenario is in
   scope, as long as the network requirements for VM live migration can
   be satisfied.  VM migration between L3 subnet, for now, is not in the
   scope.  The solutions we develop in SAMI should enable both state
   migration within DC and between DCs, which is logically in the same
   Layer 2 network.

   For the first stage, we only migrate Session tables on Firewall.  But
   the solution should be extensible to enable migration of other states

   we may find that is necessary to be migrated during VM live
   migration.

   We should always try to reuse existing IETF work to resolve SAMI
   problem.  Only when there is no existing IETF work can use, with
   suitable extension, to achieve State migration, shall we develop a
   new mechanism to do this.


6.  Security Considerations

   The states described above are all about security.  Besides, we need
   to be careful to avoid poisoned states from untrusted source.  That
   means no matter how the states are migrated, authentication and
   verification are required.
