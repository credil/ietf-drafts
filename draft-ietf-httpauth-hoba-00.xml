<t>
HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication (HOBA) is a design for an HTTP authentication
method with credentials that are not vulnerable to phishing attacks,
and that does not require a server-side password database. The design can
also be used in Javascript-based authentication embedded in HTML. HOBA is an
alternative to HTTP authentication schemes that require passwords with all the
negative attributes that come with password-based systems. HOBA can be
integrated with account management and other applications running over HTTP
and supports portability, so a user can associate more than one device or
origin-bound key with the same service. We also describe a way in which 
the HOBA design
can be used from a Javascript web client. 
When deployed, HOBA will be a drop-in replacement for password-based HTTP
authentication or JavaScript authentication.

<section title="Introduction">

<t>[[ Commentary is in double-square brackets, like this. As you'll
see there are a bunch of details still to be figured out. Feedback
on those is very welcome. Also note that the authors fully expect that
the description of HOBA-http and HOBA-js to be mostly merged in the
draft; they're both here now so readers can see some alternatives
and maybe support particular proposals. ]]</t>

<t>
HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication (HOBA) is a proposal for an authentication
design that can be used as an HTTP authentication scheme and for 
Javascript-based authentication embedded in HTML.
The main goal of HOBA is to offer an
easy-to-implement authentication scheme that is not based on passwords, but
that can easily replace HTTP or HTML forms-based password authentication. If
deployment of HOBA reduces the number of password entries in databases by any
appreciable amount, then it would be worthwhile.
As an HTTP authentication
scheme, it would work in the current HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1 authentication
framework, and will very likely work with whatever changes are made to the HTTP
authentication scheme in HTTP 2.0.
As a JavaScript design, HOBA demonstrates a way for clients and servers to interact using
the same credentials that are use by the HTTP authentication scheme.
</t>

<t>
The HTTP specification defines basic and digest authentication methods for
HTTP that have been in use for many years, but which, being based on
passwords, are susceptible to theft of server-side databases. (See  <xref
target="RFC2617"/> for the original specification, and <xref
target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-p7-auth"/> for clarifications and updates to the
authentication mechanism.)
Even though few large web sites use basic and digest authentication, they still
use username/password authentication and thus have large susceptible
server-side databases of passwords.
</t>

<t>Instead of passwords, HOBA uses digital
signatures as an authentication mechanism. HOBA also adds useful features such
as credential management and session logout.
In HOBA, the client creates a new public-private key pair for each host
("web-origin") to which it authenticates; web-origins are defined in <xref
target="RFC6454"/>. These keys are used in HOBA for HTTP clients to
authenticate themselves to servers in the HTTP protocol or in a Javascript
authentication program. HOBA keys need not be stored in public key certificates, but instead
in subjectPublicKeyInfo structures from PKIX <xref target="RFC5280"/>. Because
these are generally "bare keys", there is none of the semantic overhead of PKIX
certificates, particularly with respect to naming and trust anchors. Thus,
client public keys ("CPKs") do not have any publicly-visible identifier for
the user who possesses the corresponding private key, nor the web-origin with which 
the client is using the CPK.
</t>

<t>
HOBA also defines some services that are required for
modern HTTP authentication:

<list style="symbols">

<t>
Servers can bind a CPK with an identifier, such as an account name. HOBA allows
servers to define their own policies for binding CPKs with accounts
during account registration.
</t>

<t> 
Users are likely to use more than one device or user agent (UA) for the same
HTTP based service, so HOBA gives a way to associate more than one CPK to
the same account, but without having to register for each separately.
</t>

<t>
Users are also likely to lose a private key, or the client's memory of which
key pair is associated with which origin. For example if a user loses the computer or
mobile device in which state is stored. HOBA allows for clients to tell servers
to delete the association between a CPK and an account.
</t>

<t>
Logout features can be useful for user agents, so HOBA defines a way to close a
current HTTP "session", and also a way to close all current sessions, even if
more than one session is currently active from different user agents for the
same account.
</t>

</list></t>

<section title="Comparison of HOBA and Current Password Authentication">

<t>
[[ This will be a few paragraphs explaining how HOBA can be used as a drop-in
replacement for the common form-and-cookie authentication used today. It will
show how similar many of the concepts are, and also point out some of the
advantages sites will get by changing to HOBA. ]]
</t>

</section>

<section title="Terminology">

<t>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.
</t>

<t>A client public key ("CPK") is the public key and associated cryptographic parameters
needed for a server to validate a signature.</t>

<t>
The term "account" is (loosely) used to refer to whatever data structure(s)
the server maintains that are associated with an identity. That will 
contain of at least one CPK and a web-origin; it will also optionally include an
HTTP "realm" as defined in the HTTP authentication specification. It might
also involve many other non-standard pieces of data that the server
accumulates as part of account creation processes. An account may have many
CPKs that are considered equivalent in terms of being usable for
authentication, but the meaning of "equivalent" is really up to the server and
is not defined here.
</t>

<t>
When describing something that is specific to HOBA as an HTTP authentication
mechanism or HOBA as a JavaScript implementation, this document uses the
terms "HOBA-http" and "HOBA-js", respectively.
</t>

<t>
Web client: the content and javascript code that run within the context of a single
user agent instance (such as a tab in a web browser).
</t>

<t>
User agent (UA): typically, but not always, a web browser doing HOBA.
</t>

<t>
User: a person who is running a UA. In this document, "user" does not mean
"user name" or "account name".
</t>

<t>
This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
Form (ABNF) notation of <xref target="RFC5234"/>
</t>

</section>
</section>

<section title="The HOBA Authentication Scheme">

<t> 
A UA that implements HOBA maintains a list of web-origins and realms. The UA
also maintains one or more client credentials for each web-origin/realm combination
for which it has created a CPK.
</t>

<t>
On receipt of a challenge (and optional realm) from a server,
the client marshals an HOBA to-be-signed (TBS) blob that includes the a client generated
nonce, the web-origin, the
realm, an identifier for the CPK and the challenge string; 
and signs that hashed blob using the hash algorithm identified with the challenge
and the private key corresponding to the CPK for that web-origin.  
The formatting chosen for this TBS blob is chosen so as to make
server-side signature verification as simple as possible 
for a wide-range of current server tooling, e.g. including 
relatviely simple PHP scripts. [[ref for PHP?]]

</t>

<t>
[[Note - we do support different forms of key identifier, 
but currently only implicitly. The idea is that when you register a CPK then
you get to say what type of key identifier you're using (if that
is needed or even makes sense). When authenticating, the site
doesn't need to be told that again since it can find the CPK or
not based on the key identifier value. One could argue that the
type of key indentifier here would allow a site to support two
octet-wise identical key identifier values but with different
types. Not sure how useful that is, migth be for those who want
keys to be 3rd party validated.]]
</t>

<t><xref target="fig_tbs"/> specifies the abnf for the signature
input. 
[[This definition is core to the security of HOBA and should
ideally be based on some cryptographic protocol that's been 
well known and studied for ages. We do plan to go looking for
such a protocol, (maybe ideally more than 20 years old;-) 
but have yet to do that.]]</t>

        <figure title="To-be-signed data for HOBA" anchor="fig_tbs">
        <artwork type="abnf" align="center">

HOBA-TBS = nonce alg origin realm kid challenge
nonce = unreserved
alg = 1*2DIGIT
origin = scheme authority port 
realm = unreserved
kid = unreserved
challenge = unreserved

        </artwork>
        </figure>

<t>
The fields above contain the following:

<list style="symbols">

<t>
nonce: is a random value chosen by the UA and MUST be base64url encoded.
UAs MUST be able to use at least 32 bits of randomness in generating
a nonce. UAs SHOULD be able to use up to 64 bits of randomness for 
nonces. [[Not sure what's right here. Also - might be better to add
a "nonce-type" as well, so we could have e.g. TLS channel bindings
as an option.]]
</t>

<t>
alg: specifies the signature algorithm being used encoded as an ASCII
charecter as defined in <xref target="sec_alg"/>.
RSA-SHA256 MUST be supported, RSA-SHA1 MAY be supported.
</t>

<t>
origin: is the web origin expressed as the catentation of the 
scheme, authority and port are from <xref target="RFC3986"/>. These
are not base64 encoded as they will be most readily available to the server
in plain text.
</t>

<t>
realm: is similarly just a string with the syntactic restrictions
defined in 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-p7-auth"/>.
If no realm is specified for
this authentication then this is absent. (A missing field here is
no problem since both sides know when it needs to be there.)
</t>

<t>
kid: is a key identifier - this MUST be a base64url encoded value
that is presented to the server in the HOBA client result (see
below).
</t>

<t>challenge: MUST be a base64url encoded challenge value that the
server chose to send to the client</t>

</list>
</t>

<t>
The HOBA-TBS string is the input to the client's signing
process, but is not itself sent over the network since some
fields are already inherent in the HTTP exchange. The challenge
however is sent over the network so as to make it simpler for
a server to be stateless. (One form of stateless challenge might
be a ciphertext that the server decrypts and checks, but
that is an implementation detail.) The value that is sent
over the network is the HOBA "client result" which we now
define.
</t>

<t>
The HOBA "client result" is a dot-separated string that includes the signature and
is sent in the HTTP Authorized header field value using the 
value syntax defined in <xref target="fig_res"/>. The "sig"
value is the base64url encoded version of the binary output
of the signing process. The kid, challenge and nonce are as
defined above and are also base64url encoded.
[[Expect more changes here. This is very like JOSE's 
compact form and maybe ought be an instance of that.]]
</t>

        <figure title="HOBA Client Result value" anchor="fig_res">
        <artwork type="abnf" align="center">

HOBA-RES = kid "." challenge "." nonce "." sig

		</artwork>
		</figure>

<t>HOBA will support the idea of multiple users on the same user agent.
This will be useful for the problem of "can I use your browser to check my mail..."
and so on.
It is [[ currently ]] described only in the HOBA-js section, but will apply equally
to HOBA-http.
[[There are implications beyond the discussion in HOBA-js here in that there would only
      be a single CPK for a set of users for a given origin since normative HOBA-http has 
      no clue at all about users and the like. This needs more thought.]]
</t>

<t>
The HOBA scheme is far from new, for example, the basic idea
is pretty much identical to the first two messages from "Mechanism R"
on page 6 of <xref target="MI93"/> which predates HOBA by 20 years.
</t>

</section>

<section title="HOBA HTTP Authentication Mechanism">

<t>
An HTTP server that supports HOBA authentication includes the "hoba"
auth-scheme value in a WWW-Authenticate header field when it wants the
client to authenticate with HOBA.  

<list style="symbols">

<t>
If the "hoba" scheme is listed, it MUST be followed by two or more auth-param
values. The auth-param attributes defined by this specification are below. 
Other auth-param attributes MAY be used as well. Unknown auth-param attributes
MUST be ignored by clients, if present.
</t>

<t>
The "challenge" attribute MUST be included. The challenge is a string of
base64url encoded octets that the server wants the client to sign in its response. The
challenge SHOULD be unique for every HTTP 401 response in order to prevent replay
attacks from passive observers. 
</t>

<t>
A "realm" attribute MAY be included to indicate the scope of protection in the
manner described in HTTP/1.1, Part 7 
<xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-p7-auth"/>.
The "realm" attribute MUST NOT appear more than once.
</t> 

</list></t>

<t>
When the "client response" is created, the HOBA-http client
encodes the HOBA client-result (a string matching the HOBA-RES
production in <xref target="fig_res"/> as an auth-param with the 
name "result" and returns that in the Authorization header.  
</t>

<t>
The HOBA-http authentication mechanism allows for the use of cookies for
preserving state between protected resources in one HTTP realm.
This means that the server need only send the WWW-Authenticate header field
once, and can rely on cookie management for keeping state.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Using HOBA-http">
<t>
[[A lot of this is similar to the HOBA-js discussion below. At some
      point some nuclear fusion might be nice, but for now it might be best to keep
      them separate until we understand better what can be merged, and what
      is different.]]
</t>

<t>
The interaction between an HTTP client and HTTP server using HOBA
happens in three phases: the CPK preparation phase, the signing
phase, and the authentication phase. 
The first and second phase are done in a standard fashion; the third is
done using site-specific methods.
</t>

<t>[[ Need to describe what happens if the user bails half way through the flow. ]]</t>

<section title="CPK Preparation Phase">

<t>
In the CPK preparation phase, the client determines if it already has a CPK for
the web-origin it is going to. If the has a CPK, the client will use it; if the
client does not have a CPK, it generates one in anticipation of the
server asking for one.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Signing Phase">

<t>
In the signing phase, the client connects to the server, the server asks
for HOBA-based authentication, and the client authenticates by signing
a blob of information as described in the previous sections.
</t>

<t>
The user agent tries to access a protected resource on the server.
The server sends the HOBA WWW-Authenticate challenge.
The user agent receives the challenge and signs the challenge using the CPK
it either already had or just generated.
The server validates the signature. If validation fails, the
server aborts the transaction. [[ Or maybe it asks again? ]]
</t>

</section>

<section title="Authentication Phase">

<t>
In the authentication phase, the server extracts the CPK from the
signing phase and decides if it recognizes the CPK. If the server
recognizes the CPK, the server may finish the client authentication
process. If the process involves a second factor
<!-- [[MT: I'm pretty sure 
we don't mean factor as in the "something I know, something I have..." sense, yes?]] --> 
of authentication, 
such as asking the user which account it wants to use (in the
case where a user agent is used for multiple accounts on a site), the 
server may prompt the user for the account identifying information. None
of this is standardized: it all follows the server's security policy and
session flow. At the end of this, the server probably assigns or updates 
a session cookie for the client.
</t>

<t>
If the server does not recognize the CPK the server might send the
client through a either a join or login-new-user-agent (see below) process. This process 
is completely up to the server, and probably entails using HTML, JavaScript and
CSS to ask the user some questions in order to assess whether or
not the server wants to give the client an account. Completion of the joining
process might entail require confirmation by email, SMS, Captcha, and so on.
</t>

<t>
Note that there is no necessity for the server to initiate a joining
or login process upon completion of the signing phase. Indeed, the server
may desire to challenge the user agent even for unprotected resources and
carry along the CPK in a session cookie for later use in a join or login
process as it becomes necessary. For example, a server might only want to offer an
account to someone who had been to a few pages on the web site;
in such a case, the server could use the CPK from an associated session cookie
as a way of building reputation for the user until the server wants the user
to join.
</t>

<!--
[[MT: the following section isn't really the way sites view the world. login/join changes
     server session state and is pretty orthogonal to whether there's a protected resource 
     or not. often upon login/join, the next page is not protected. login/join just sets state
     for future protected activities, as well as contextual behavior dependent on which
     account is being accessed. I think it would be better to not link hoba-authenticated
     to the notion of "protected"]]
-->
<t>
After the UA is authenticated (if the user had to join, this could
be the last step of joining), the server gives the UA access to the
protected resource that was originally requested at the
beginning of the signing phase. It is quite likely that the server would
also update the UA's session cookie for the web site.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Logging in on a New User Agent">

<t>
When a user wants to use a new user agent for an existing account, the
flows are similar to logging in with an already-joined UA or joining for
the first time. In fact, the CPK preparation phase (with the UA knowing
that it needs to create a new CPK) and the signing phase are identical.
</t>

<t>
During the authentication phase, the server could use HTML, JavaScript and
CSS to ask the user if they are really a new user or want to associate
this new CPK with an already-joined CPK. The server can then use some
out-of-band method (such as a confirmation email round trip, SMS, or an UA that is 
already enrolled) to verify that the "new" user is the same as the already-enrolled one.
</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Using HOBA-js">

<t>
[[ A description of how to use the same HOBA semantics, but doing
everything in Javascript in a web page. This is more of a
demonstration that you could get the similar semantics via JS 
rather than a normative section.]]
</t>

<t>
Web sites using javascript can also perform origin-bound authentication without needing
to involve the http layer, and by inference not needing HOBA-specific support in browsers. One element
is required: localStorage (see http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/), and one when it is available
will be highly desirable: WebCrypto (see http://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI). In lieu of WebCrypto,
javascript crypto libraries can be employed with the known deficiencies of PRNG, and the general immaturity of
those libraries. The following section outlines a mechanism for Javascript HOBA clients to initially enroll, 
subsequent enrollment on new clients, login, and how HOBA-js relates to web based session management. 
As with HOBA-http, a pure Javascript implementation retains the property that only CPKs are stored on 
the server, so that server compromise doesn't suffer the multiplier affect that the various recent 
password exposure debacles have vividly demonstrated.
</t>

<section title="Key Storage">

<t>
We use the new HTML 5 webstorage feature that is now widely available. Conceptually an
implementation stores in the origin's localStorage dictionary account identifier, public key, private key
tuples for subsequent authentication requests. How this is actually stored in localStorage is
an implementation detail. We rely on the security properties of the same-origin policy that 
localStorage enforces. See the security considerations for discussion about attacks on localStorage.
</t>

</section>

<section title="User Join">

<t>
To join a web site, the HOBA-js client generates a public/private key pair and
takes as input the account identifier to which the 
key pair should be bound. The key pair and account identifier are stored in localStorage
for later use. The user agent then signs the join information (see below) using
the private key, and forms a message with the public key (CPK)
and the signed data. The server receives the message and verifies the signed
data using the supplied key. The server creates the account and adds the public
key to a list of public keys associated with this account.

</t>

</section>

<section title="User Login">

<t>
Each time the user needs to log in to the server, it creates a login message
(see below) and signs the message using the relevant private key stored in localStorage. 
The signed login message along with the associated CPK identifier is sent to the server. 
The server receives the message and verifies the signed data. If the supplied public key 
is amongst the set of valid public keys for the supplied account, then the login proceeds.  
See below for a discussion about replay.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Enrolling a New User Agent">

<t>
When a user wants to start using a different UA, the website has two
choices: use a currently enrolled UA to permit the enrollment or use a
trusted out of band mechanism (eg email, sms, etc). To enroll a new UA
using an existing UA, the web site can display a one-time password on
the currently enrolled UA. This password is a one-time password and
expires in a fixed amount of time (say, 30 minutes). It doesn't need to be an
overly fussy password since it's one-time and times out quickly. The user then
inputs the one-time password and the new UA generates a new asymmetric
key pair and includes the one-time password in the login message to the
server (see below).
</t>

<t>
Alternatively if an enrolled UA is not available, and the site has an out of
band communication mechanism (eg, sms, email, etc) a user can request that a one-time
password be sent to the user. 
The server generates and stores the one-time password as above. 
The user receives the one-time password, inputs as above on the new UA, and the 
HOBA-js client forms the login message as above. 
</t>

<t>
In both cases, when the server receives a login message with a one-time password, it checks
to see if the password supplied is in a list of unexpired one-time passwords associated with
that account. If the password matches, the server verifies the signature, expires or deletes the 
one-time password and adds the supplied public key to the list of public keys associated with 
the user assuming the signature verified correctly. Subsequent logins proceed as above in User Login.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Replay Protection">

<t>
To guard against replay of a legitimate login/join message, we use Kerberos-like timestamps in the
expectation of synchronization between the browser's and server's clocks is sufficiently reliable.
This saves an HTTP round trip which is desirable, though a challenge-response mechanism 
as in HOBA-http could also be used. The client 
puts the current system time into the URL, and the server side vets it against its system time. 
Like Kerberos, a replay cache covering a signature timeout window is required on the server. 
This can be done using a database table that is keyed (in the database sense of the term) using the signature bits.  If the signature 
is in the replay table, it ought be rejected. If the timestamp in the signature is outside the
current replay cache window then
it also gets rejected. 
</t>

<t>
[[ An addition of the ability for the server to reject a client with potential time skew
  and give it a nonce (as with HOBA-http) would allow the size of the replay
  cache to be set to just a few minutes rather than a much longer period. Or the HOBA
  server could always use a nonce method. This is worthy of more discussion. ]].
</t>

<!--
<t>
[[ The experience with kerberos on the Internet is that you used to need
a 24 hour window due to TZ errors on clients. Dunno if that's better now than 15 years
ago. ]]
</t>
-->

</section>

<section title="Signature Parameters">

<t>
Since we only require agreement between the server and the client where the client is
under the control of the server, the actual url parameter names here are only advisory.
For each signed url, the client forms a url with the necessary login/join information.
For example, suppose example.com has login and join scripts with various parameters:

<list style="symbols">

<t>http://example.com/site/login.php?username=Mike</t>

<t>http://example.com/site/join.php?username=Mike&amp;email=mike@example.com&amp;sms=555.1212</t>

</list></t>

<t>
The client then appends a signature parameter block to the url:

<list style="symbols">

<t>curtime: the time in milliseconds since unix epoch (ie, new Date ().getTime ()).</t>

<t>pubkey: the url encoded public key. See DKIM for the format of the base64 encoded PEM formated key.</t>

<t>temppass: an optional url encoded one-time password for subsequent enrollment.</t>

<t>keyalg: currently RSA. 2048 bit keys should be use if WebCrypto is available</t>

<t>digestalg: currently SHA1. SHA256 should be used if WebCrypto is available.</t>

<t>signature: empty for signing canonicalization purposes</t>

</list></t>

<t>
[[ Signing the full url is problematic with PHP; we should take a clue from what OAUTH does here;
 we almost certainly need to add some host identifying information...]]

To create the signature, the canonical text includes the path portion, the
site-specific url parameters and appends a signature block onto the end of the
url. The signature block consists of the parameters listed above with an empty
signature parameter (ie, signature=), eg:

<list style="symbols">

<t>Login: /site/login.php?username=Mike&amp;curtime=1234567890.1234&amp;keyalg=RSA&amp;digestalg=SHA1&amp;signature=</t>

<t> Join: /site/join.php?username=Mike&amp;email=mike@example.com&amp;curtime=1234567890.1234&amp;keyalg=RSA&amp;digestalg=SHA1&amp;signature=</t>

<t>Login New User Agent: /site/login.php?username=Mike&amp;curtime=1234567890.1234&amp;temppass=1239678&amp;keyalg=RSA&amp;digestalg=SHA1&amp;signature=</t>

</list>
</t>

<t>
The canonical signature text is then signed with the private key associated with the account.
The signature is then base64 encoded and appended to the full url, and 
sent to the server using XMLHttpRequest as usual. On receipt of the login request, 
the server first extracts the timestamp  (curtime) and determines whether the timestamp 
is fresh (see above) rejecting the request if stale. 
The server then removes the scheme and domain:port portion of the incoming url, 
and removes the signature value only to create the canonical signature text. The server then extracts
the public key along with the account and verifies the signature. If the signature verifies, the server
then determines whether this is an enrolled public key for the user. If it is, login/join succeeds.
If the key is not enrolled, the server then checks to see if a one-time password was supplied. 
If not, login/join fails. If a one-time password was supplied, the server checks to see if 
a one-time password is valid and fails if not. If valid, the server disables the one-time
password (eg, deletes it from its database) and adds the new public key to the list of 
enrolled public keys for this user.
</t>

<t>
Once verified, the server may start up normal cookie-based session management (see below). 
The server should send back status to the HOBA-js client to determine whether the login/join
was successful. The details are left as an implementation detail. 
</t>

<t>
Note: the client SHOULD use an HTTP POST for the XMLHttpRequest as both the public key and
signature blocks may exhaust the maximum size for a GET request (typically around 2KB).
</t>

</section>

<section title="Session Management">

<t>
Session Management is identical to username/password session management. That is, the
session management tool (such as PHP, Python CGI, and so on)
inserts a session cookie into the output to the browser, and
logging out simply removes the session cookie. HOBA-js does 
nothing to help or hurt session cookie hijacking -- TLS is still our friend.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Multiple Accounts on One User Agent">

<t>
A shared UA with multiple accounts is possible if the account identifier is stored along with the 
asymmetric key pair binding them to one another. Multiple entries can be kept, one for each 
account, and selected by the current user. This, of course, is fraught with the possibility 
for abuse, since you're enrolling the device potentially long-term. A couple of things can 
possibly be done to combat that. First, the user can request that the credential be erased 
from keystore. Similarly, in the enrollment phase, a user could request that the key pair only 
be kept for a certain amount of time, or that it not be stored at all. Last, it's probably 
best to just not use shared devices at all since that's never especially safe.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Oddities">

<t>
With the same-origin policy, subdomains do not have access to the same
localStorage as parent domains do. For larger/more complex sites this could be
an issue that requires enrollment into subdomains with the requisite hassle
for users. One way to get around this is to use session cookies as they can be
used across subdomains. That is, login using a single well-known domain, and
then use session cookies to navigate around a site.
</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Additional Services">

<t>
HOBA uses a well-known URL <xref target="RFC5785"/> "hoba" as a base URI
for performing many tasks: "https://www.example.com/.well-known/hoba".
These URLs
are based on the name of the host that the HTTP client is accessing.
There are many use cases for these URLs to redirect to other URLs: a site that
does registration through a federated site, a site that only does registration
under HTTPS, and so on. Like any HTTP client, HOBA clients MUST be able to
handle redirection of these URLs. [[There are a bunch of security issues to
consider related to cases where a re-direct brings you off-origin.]]
</t>

<t>
All additional services MUST be done in TLS-protected sessions (<xref target="RFC5246"/>).
</t>

<section title="Registration">

<t>
Normally, a registration is expected to happen after a UA receives a
WWW-Authenticate for a web-origin and realm for which it has no associated CPK. The
(protocol part of the) process of registration for a HOBA account on a server is relatively
light-weight. The UA generates a new key pair, and associates it with the
web-origin/realm in question. The UA sets up a TLS-protected session, goes
to the registration URL ".well-known/hoba/register", and submits the CPK using
a POST message as described below. It is up to the
server to decide what kind of user interaction is required before the account
is finally set up.
</t>

<t>
If the UA has a CPK associated with the web-origin, but not for the
realm concerned, then a new registration is REQUIRED. If the server
did not wish for that outcome, then it ought not use a different
realm.
</t>

<t>
The POST message sent to the registration URL contains an HTML form
(x-www-form-encoded) with one mandatory field (pub) and some
optional fields that allow the UA to specify the type and value
of key and device identifiers that the UA wishes to use.
[[The device stuff is just a thought.]]

<list style="symbols">

<t>
pub: is a mandatory field containing the PEM formatted public key of the
client. See Appendix C of <xref target="RFC6376"/> for an example
of how to generate this key format.
</t>

<t>
kidtype: contains the type of key identifier, this is a numeric
value intended to contain one of the values from <xref target="sec_kidtypes"/>.
If this is not present then the mandatory to implement "DANE-hash"
option MUST be used.
</t>

<t>
kid: contains the key identifier as a base64url encoded string 
that is of the type indicated in the kidtype. If the kid is a hash
of a public key then the correct (base64url encoded) hash value MUST be provided and
the server SHOULD check that and refuse the registration if an incorrect
value was supplied.
</t>

<t>
didtype: specifies a kind of device identifier intended to contain
one of the values from <xref target="sec_didtypes"/>, if absent then the
"string" form of device identifier MUST be used. 
</t>

<t>
did: A UTF8 string that specifies the device identifier. This can be 
used to help a user be confident that authentication has worked, e.g.,
following authentication some web content might say "You last logged
in from device 'did' at time T." 
</t>

</list>

</t>

</section>

<section title="Associating Additional Keys to an Exiting Account">

<t>
It is common for a user to have multiple UAs, and to want all those UAs to be
able to authenticate to a single account. One method to allow a
user who has an existing account to be able to authenticate on a second device
is to securely transport the private and public keys and the origin
information from the first device to the second. Previous history with such
key transport has been spotty at best. As an alternative, HOBA allows associating a CPK
from the second device to the account created on the first device.
</t>

<t> Instead of registering on the new device, the UA generates a new key pair,
associates it with the web-origin/realm in question, goes to the URL for
starting an association, ".well-known/hoba/associate-start" in a TLS-protected
session, and submits the new CPK using a POST message. [[ More description is
clearly needed here. ]] The server's response to this request is a nonce with
at least 128 bits of entropy. That nonce SHOULD be easy for the user to copy
and type, such as using Base32 encoding (see <xref target="RFC4648"/>). The
user then uses the first UA to log into the origin, goes to the URL for
finishing an association, ".well-known/hoba/associate-finish", and submits the
nonce using a POST message. [[ More description is clearly needed here. ]].
The server then knows that the authenticated user is associated with the
second CPK. The server can choose to associate the two CPKs with one account.
Whether to do so is entirely at the server's discretion however, but the
server SHOULD make the outcome clear to the user. </t>

</section>

<section title="Logging Out">

<t>
When the user wishes to logout, the 
UA simply goes to ".well-known/hoba/logout". The UA MAY also delete
session cookies associated with the session. [[Is that right?, maybe
a SHOULD- or MUST-delete would be better]] 
</t>

<t>
The server-side MUST NOT allow
TLS session resumption for any logged out session and SHOULD also revoke or
delete any cookies associated with the session.  
</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Mandatory-to-Implement Algorithms">

<t>
RSA-SHA256 MUST be supported. RSA-SHA1 MAY be used.
RSA modulus lengths of at least 2048 bits SHOULD be used.
</t>

<t>
[[Maybe we should add ECDSA with P256 for shorter signatures.]]
</t>

</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">

<t>
If key binding was server-selected then a bad actor could bind different
accounts belonging to the user from the network with possible bad consequences,
especially if one of the private keys was compromised somehow. 
</t>

<t>
Binding my CPK with someone else's account would be fun and profitable so
SHOULD be appropriately hard. In particular the string generated by the server MUST
be hard to guess, for whatever level of difficulty is chosen by the 
server. The server SHOULD NOT allow a random guess to reveal whether
or not an account exists.
</t>

<t>
[[The potential impact on privacy of HOBA needs to be addressed. If
a site can use a 401 and a CPK to track users without permission 
that would be not-so-nice so some guidance on how a UA could 
indicate to a user that HOBA stuff is going on might be needed.]]
</t>

<t>
[[lots more TBD, be nice to your private keys etc. etc.]]
</t>

<section title="localStorage Security for Javascript">

<t>
Our use of localStorage will undoubtedly be a cause for concern. localStorage uses the
same-origin model which says that the scheme, domain and port define a localStorage instance.
Beyond that, any code executing will have access to private keying material. Of 
particular concern are XSS attacks which could conceivably take the keying material and use
it to create user agents under the control of an attacker. But XSS attacks are in
reality across the board devastating since they can and do steal credit card information, 
passwords, perform illicit acts, etc, etc. It's not clear that we introduce unique threats
from which clear text passwords don't already suffer.
</t>

<t>
Another source of concern is local access to the keys. That is, if an attacker has access
to the UA itself, they could snoop on the key through a javascript console, or find 
the file(s) that implement localStorage on the host computer. Again it's not clear that we
are worse in this regard because the same attacker could get at browser password files, etc too. 
One possible mitigation is to encrypt the keystore with a password/pin the user supplies. 
This may sound counter intuitive, but the object here is to keep passwords off of servers to 
mitigate the multiplier effect of a large scale compromise ala LinkedIn because of 
shared passwords across sites.
</t>

<t>
It's worth noting that HOBA uses asymmetric keys and not passwords when evaluating threats. As 
various password database leaks have shown, the real threat of a password breach is not just to the site that 
was breached, it's all of the sites a user used the same password on too. That is, the 
collateral damage is severe because password reuse is common. Storing a password in 
localStorage would also have a similar multiplier effect for an attacker, though perhaps on a 
smaller scale than a server-side compromise: one successful crack gains the attacker potential access 
to hundreds if not thousands of sites the user visits. HOBA does not suffer from that attack multiplier
since each asymmetric key pair is unique per site/useragent/user.

<section title="Problems with Passwords">

<t>
By far the most common mechanism for web authentication is passwords that can
be remembered by the user, called "memorizable passwords".
There is plenty of good research on how users typically use memorizable
passwords ([[ handful of citations goes here ]]), but some of the highlights
are that users typically try hard to reuse passwords on as many web sites as
possible, and that web sites often use either email addresses or users' names
as the identifier that goes with these passwords.
</t>

<t>
If an attacker gets access to the database of memorizable passwords, that
attacker can impersonate any of the users. Even if the breach is discovered,
the attacker can still impersonate users until every password is changed.
Even if all the passwords are changed or at least made unusable, the
attacker now possesses a list of likely username/password pairs that might
exist on other sites.
</t>

<t>
Using memorizable passwords on unencrypted channels also poses risks to the
users. If a web site uses either the HTTP Plain authentication method, or an
HTML form that does no cryptographic protection of the password in transit, a
passive attacker can see the password and immediately impersonate the user. If
a hash-based authentication scheme such as HTTP Digest authentication is used,
a passive attacker still has a high chance of being able to determine the
password using a dictionary of known passwords.
</t>

<t>
[[ Say a bit about non-memorizable passwords. Still subject to database
attack, although that doesn't give the attacker knowledge for other systems.
Safe if digest authentication is used, but that's rare. ]]
