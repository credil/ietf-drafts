                Extension to LISP NAT Traversal Proposal

Abstract

   This draft specifies several special NAT traversal scenarios when two
   or more LISP Sites/MNs which locate behind the same NAT equipment
   communicate with each other.  When these LISP Sites/MNs communicate
   with each other, it may cause routing latency and will increase re-
   encapsulation load on Re-encapsulating Tunnel Routers(RTRs) based on
   existing LISP-NAT strategy.

   In this draft, we give detail descriptions of these scenarios.  Also
   we propose some suggestions to solve the problems.  According to our
   strategy, a new kind of message is used for RTRs to send relative
   information of Corresponding Sites/MNs to xTRs.

Internet-Draft  Extension to LISP NAT Traversal Proposal       July 2012


1.  Introduction

   Locator/ID Separation Protocol [LISP] defines a set of functions for
   encapsulating routers to exchange information used to map from
   Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) to routable Routing Locators (RLOCs).
   When a LISP site locates behind a NAT, LISP Tunnel Routers (xTRs) are
   only reachable through the NAT's public address which broke the
   assumption that xTRs are reachable at their RLOCs.

   To make sure LISP devices locate behind a NAT reachable, [LISP-NAT]
   proposes a NAT traversal mechanism for LISP.  To achieve this, an ETR
   of a LISP site will use its Map-Server to discover whether it is
   behind a NAT and to get its translated global RLOC and port via two
   LISP messages: Info-Request and Info-Reply.  Once an ETR detects it
   locates behind a NAT, it use a LISP Re-encapsulating Tunnel Router
   (RTR) to act as a data plane 'anchor point' to send and receive
   traffic through the NAT device.

   According to RTR proxy strategy introduced in [LISP-NAT], when an ITR
   behind a NAT needs to encapsulate outbound LISP traffic, it does not
   send Map-Request for destination EIDs, but just use RTR RLOC as
   locator for all destination EIDs that it wishes to send data to.

   However, in some special scenarios such like two or more LISP Sites/
   MNs locate behind the same NAT, when these LISP Sites/MNs communicate
   with each other, this RTR proxy strategy will cause routing latency
   and extra decapsulation/re-encapsulation cost on RTR.  In this draft,
   we list and describe several special cases.  A new kind of message
   "Info-Notify" is adopted.  This message is used by RTR to notify the
   LISP Site with relative information of its Corresponding Site which
   locates behind the same NAT with it.  Based on this "Info-Notify"
   message, some feasible solutions are proposed.


2.  Definition of Terms

   This draft uses terms defined in [LISP] and [LISP-NAT].  This section
   introduces some new terms used in the document.

   Corresponding Site/MN  When two LISP Sites/MNs communicate with each
      other, each LISP Sites/MN is considered as Corresponding Site/MN
      of the other one, regardless of Site's/MN's status, i.e. it is a
      sender or a receiver.

   Info-Notify  A message used by RTR to notify LISP Site with relative
      information of its Corresponding Site.

3.  Issue Statement

   In this section, several scenarios are specified.

3.1.  Basic Scenario-Single Level NAT

   As shown in Fig.1, there are two LISP Sites (Site1 and Site2) locate
   behind the same Nat equipment (NAT1).  Furthermore, xTRs of the two
   sites choose the same RTR as proxy to register mapping information
   and transfer data traffic.

 |     Site1     | ETR1 |_____|____| |____|_____| ETR2 |     Site2     |
 |               +------+     |           |     +------+               |

                 Fig.1 Case 1: Single Level Nat Traversal

   Based on RTR proxy strategy proposed in [LISP-NAT], when Host1 in
   Site1 want to send a packet to Host2 in Site2, following steps will
   be performed.

   1.  Host1 sends a packet to ITR1 of Site1, destination of the packet
       is EID address of Host2.

   2.  When ITR1 receives the packet, it encapsulates it in a LISP data
       header with outer header destination set to RTR RLOC and outer
       header destination port set to 4341.  Based on RTR proxy
       strategy, ITR1 will not send Map-Request for Host2.  As a result,
       ITR1 is not able to get RLOCs of Site2, i.e.  ETR2's RLOC.

   3.  When encapsulated packet passes through NAT, NAT transform the
       source address and source port in outer header to be global
       address and port.  This may create a state in the NAT device.

Internet-Draft  Extension to LISP NAT Traversal Proposal       July 2012


   4.  When RTR receive the encapsulated packet destination to its RLOC,
       it decapsulates the packet, and look for if there are local
       mapping information match the destination EID.  As Site2 also
       registers through the RTR, RTR will find mapping information of
       Site2, as well as global state of ETR2 including the global
       address and global port in its local cache.

   5.  RTR uses ETR2's global state information to re-encapsulate the
       packet, and transfer it to ETR2.

   Seen from steps enumerated above, based on existing RTR Proxy
   strategy, even though Site1 and Site2 locate behind the same NAT,
   traffic between these Sites need to route to the RTR which locates
   outside the NAT.

   However, as Site1 and Site2 locate behind the same NAT, that's to
   say, ITR1 and ETR2 locate in the same Intranet, RLOC of ETR2 is
   reachable to ITR1.  As a result, if ITR1 could get mapping
   information of Site2, it could encapsulate the packet directly to
   RLOC of ETR2 which could avoid routing latency of packet and could
   lighten re-encapsulation load on RTR.

3.2.  Extended Scenario I-Multiple Levels NAT

   In some topologies, there may include multiple NAT devices.  Consider
   the scenario depicted in Fig.2.  Suppose NAT1 is a large industrial
   NAT deployed by an internet service provider (ISP) to multiplex many
   customers onto a few public IP addresses, and NAT2 is a small
   consumer NAT router deployed by one of the ISP's customers to
   multiplex its private home networks onto its ISP-provided IP
   addresses.  Only RTR and NAT1 have globally routable IP addresses;
   Site1's RLOC addresses and the "public" IP addresses used by NAT2 are
   actually private to the ISP's address realm, while Site2's addresses
   are private to the addressing realms of NAT2.

   When Site1 register through RTR, it follows the same steps described
   in [LISP-NAT].  NAT1 establishes states for sessions between RTR and
   xTR1s.  RTR stores relative information of Site1 in its cache,
   including mapping information, global IP addresses and global ports
   of xTR1s, etc..

   According to Site2, when Site2 register through RTR, both NAT1 and
   NAT2 will establish states for sessions between RTR and xTRs.  When
   Site2 sends messages no matter control messages or data packets to
   RTR, both NAT2 and NAT1 translates IP address and port of packet's
   out header.

   According to RTR, when RTR receives an encapsulated packet from
   Site2, out header address of packet will be a routable address
   assigned by NAT1, and inner header address will be EID of source
   host.  As a result, addresses which assigned by NAT2 and used for
   routing between NAT1 and NAT2 are invisible to RTR.  In RTR's local
   cache, it will store relative information of Site2, including mapping
   information, global IP addresses and global ports of xTR2s which are
   assigned by NAT1, etc.

   In this scenario, every packet from Host1 to Host2 will follow the
   path:

      Host1 -> ITR1 -> NAT1 -> RTR -> NAT2 -> ETR2 ->Host2

   RTR will perform decapsulation and re-encapsulation process.

   Based on existing RTR Proxy strategy, traffic between Site1 and Site2
   still needs to route to the RTR which locates outside the NAT.

   According to scenario depicted in Fig.2, even if ITR1 could get
   mapping information of Site2, ETR2's RLOC is not reachable to ITR1.

   However, if ITR2 gets global information of Site2, i.e. global
   addresses and global ports of xTR2s which are used to route outside
   NAT1, it could encapsulate packets directly to ETR2's global address.
   If NAT1 supports Hairpin function, the packets destination to ETR2's
   global address will be route to Site2, and need not to be re-
   encapsulated by RTR.

3.3.  Extended Scenario II-Multiple Levels NAT

   As shown in Fig.3, Site1 and Site2 both locate behind two levels NAT.
   Site1 and Site2 register through RTR as we described in Section 3.2.

   In this scenario, each packet from Host1 to Host2 follows the path:

      Host1 -> ITR1 -> NAT2 -> NAT1 -> RTR -> NAT3 -> ETR2 ->Host2

   In this situation, if Site1 gets global information of the
   Corresponding Site, ITR1 could probe ETR2's global IP address.  If
   NAT1 support Hairpin function, probe message will be transfer to
   Site2, and Site1 need not to encapsulate packet to RTR anymore.

4.  Solutions

   According analysis we described above, in these section we propose
   our solution strategy.  In this

   This mechanism enables RTR to send an "Info-Notify" message to the
   LISP Site with relative information of its Corresponding Site.

4.1.  RTR Processing

   When RTR receives an encapsulated packet from ITR1 of Site1,
   following steps will be performed.

   1.  RTR strips the outer header and lookup in local cache for mapping
       information of destination EID.

   2.  In our extension, RTR will judge if Source Site and Destination
       Site locate behind the same NAT.  For example, based on whether
       the global address of Source Site ITR1 and global address of
       Destination Site ETR2 are the same, or whether the two global
       addresses may locate in the same address prefix.  Furthermore, if
       ISP would like to build a relationship between NAT and
       corresponding RTR, RTR could be informed with public address
       information of the NAT.

   3.  If RTR judge that source site and destination site both locate
       behind the same NAT, it could send "Info-Notify" messages which
       contain relative information of Corresponding Site to Sender ITR
       and Receiver ETR respectively.  Relative information mentioned
       above may include mapping information of Site, global addresses
       and global ports information of Site xTRs.

   Note:  After RTR sending sage to ITR, if RTR receive packet from ITR
      to the particular ETR, RTR continue to transfer the packet to
      destination ETR.

4.2.  ITR Processing

   When ITR receives "Info-Notify" message from RTR,

   1.  Based on mapping information of Destination Site, ITR could send
       a RLOC probe message to ETR's RLOC.  After receiving Mapping
       Reply from ETR, ITR could encapsulate packet directly to ETR's
       RLOC.

   2.  If Destination Site locate behind multilevel NATs, such like
       scenarios described in Fig.2 and Fig.3, ETR's RLOC is not
       reachable to ITR, and ITR will not receive Map Reply form

Internet-Draft  Extension to LISP NAT Traversal Proposal       July 2012


       Destination Site when it send RLOC Probe message to ETR's RLOC.
       In this situation, ITR could then send Probe message to ETR's
       global address.  If ITR could get map reply message, then it
       could use ETR's global address as destination address of outer
       header to encapsulate packet.

   Note  In order to avoid traffic affection, during RLOC Probe phase,
      ITR could continue to encapsulate data packet to RTR.

4.3.  ETR Processing

   When ETR receives "Info-Notify" message from RTR, ETR could choose to
   send a message such like a SMR (Solicit-Map-Request)[LISP] to ITR to
   trigger a mapping request operation.  Furthermore, ETR could use
   ITR's RLOC or global address as destination when it send the message.
