      <t>
	This specification defines an Internet Media Type, multipart/form-
	data, which can be used by a wide variety of applications and
	transported by a wide variety of protocols as a way of returning a
	set of values as the result of a user filling out a form.
	It replaces RFC 2388.
      </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>
  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	In many applications, it is possible for a user to be
	presented with a form. The user will fill out the form,
	including information that is typed, generated by user input,
	or included from files that the user has selected. When the
	form is filled out, the data from the form is sent from the
	user to the receiving application.
      </t>
      <t>
	The definition of multipart/form-data is derived from one of
	those applications, originally set out in <xref
	target="RFC1867"/> and subsequently incorporated into <xref
	target="HTML3.2"/> and <xref target="HTML4.0"/>, where forms
	are expressed in HTML, and in which the form values are sent
	via HTTP or electronic mail. This representation is widely
	implemented in numerous web browsers and web servers.
      </t>
      
      <t>
	However, multipart/form-data can be used for forms that are
	presented using representations other than HTML (spreadsheets,
	Portable Document Format, etc), and for transport using other
	means than electronic mail or HTTP. This document defines the
	representation of form values independently of the application
	for which it is used.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Definition of multipart/form-data">
      <t>
	The media-type multipart/form-data follows the rules of all
	multipart MIME data streams as outlined in <xref
	target='RFC2046'/>.  In forms, there are a series of fields to
	be supplied by the user who fills out the form.  Each field
	has a name. Within a given form, the names are unique.
      </t>
      <t>
	"multipart/form-data" contains a series of parts. Each part 
	MUST contain a content-disposition header <xref
	target='RFC2183'/> where the disposition type is "form-data",
	and where the disposition contains an (additional) parameter
	of "name", where the value of that parameter is the original
	field name in the form. For example, a part might contain a
	header:
      </t>
      <figure><artwork>
        Content-Disposition: form-data; name="user"
      </artwork></figure>
      <t>with the value corresponding to the entry of the "user" field.
      </t>
      <t>
	As with all multipart MIME types, each part has an optional
	"Content-Type", which defaults to "text/plain".  If the
	contents of a file are returned via filling out a form, then
	the file input is identified as the appropriate media type, if
	known, or "application/octet-stream".  
	
	The inclusion of multiple files returned for a single 
        file input result in multiple parts, one for each file,
        with the same name.
      </t>

      <t>
	Each part may be encoded and the "content-transfer-encoding"
	header supplied if the value of that part does not conform to
	the default encoding.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Use of multipart/form-data">
      <section title="Boundary">
	<t>
	  As with other multipart types, a boundary is selected that
	  does not occur in any of the data. Each field of the form is
	  sent, in the order defined by the sending appliction and
	  form, as a part of the multipart stream.  Each part
	  identifies the INPUT name within the original form. Each
	  part should be labelled with an appropriate content-type if
	  the media type is known (e.g., inferred from the file
	  extension or operating system typing information) or as
	  "application/octet-stream".
	</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Sets of files">
	<t>
	  If the value of a form field is a set of files rather than a
	  single file, that value can be transferred together using
	  the "multipart/mixed" format.
	</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Encoding">
	<t>
	  While the HTTP protocol can transport arbitrary binary data,
	  the default for mail transport is the 7BIT encoding.  The
	  value supplied for a part may need to be encoded and the
	  "content-transfer-encoding" header supplied if the value
	  does not conform to the default encoding.  [See section 5 of
	  <xref target="RFC2046"/> for more details.]
	</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Other attributes">
	<t>
	  Forms may request file inputs from the user; the form
	  software may include the file name and other file
	  attributes, as specified in <xref target="RFC2184"/>.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The original local file name may be supplied as well, either
	  as a "filename" parameter either of the
	  "content-disposition: form-data" header or, in the case of
	  multiple files, in a "content-disposition: file" header of
	  the subpart. The sending application MAY supply a file name;
	  if the file name of the sender's operating system is not in
	  US-ASCII, the file name might be approximated, or encoded
	  using the method of <xref target="RFC2231"/>.
	</t>
	<t>
	  This is a convenience for those cases where the files
	  supplied by the form might contain references to each other,
	  e.g., a TeX file and its .sty auxiliary style description.
	</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Charset of text in form data">
        <t>HTML forms have the convention that the value of a form entry
           with entry name "_charset_" and type "hidden" is
           automatically replaced with the name of the character
           set used for encoding.</t>
	<t>
	  Each part of a multipart/form-data is supposed to have a
	  content- type.  In the case where a field element is text,
	  the charset parameter for the text indicates the character
	  encoding used.
	</t>
	<t>
	  For example, a form with a text field in which a user typed
	  'Joe owes &lt;eu&gt;100' where &lt;eu&gt; is the Euro symbol
	  might have form data returned as:
	</t>
	<figure><artwork>
	  --AaB03x
	  content-disposition: form-data; name="field1"
	  content-type: text/plain;charset=windows-1250
	  content-transfer-encoding: quoted-printable
	  Joe owes =80100.
	  --AaB03x
	</artwork></figure>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section title="Operability considerations">
      <section title="Compression, encryption">
	<t>Some of the data in forms may be compressed or encrypted,
	using other MIME mechanisms. This is a function of the
	application that is generating the form-data.
	</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Non-ASCII field names and values" anchor="non-ascii-fields">
	<t>
	  Ordinarily MIME headers are generally required to consist
	  only of 7- bit data in the US-ASCII character set. 
          While <xref target="RFC2388"/> suggested that non-ASCII
          field names should be encoded according to the method in
	  <xref target="RFC2047"/> if they contain characters outside
	  of US-ASCII, practice varies widely.
	</t>
        <t>Those creating forms SHOULD avoid non-ASCII field names,
              for interoperability reasons. Field names are generally
              not visible and should not be translated.</t>
	<t>When encoding the result of filling a form, the results
         may be expected differently according to the encoding
        used in the original form.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Ordered fields and duplicated field names">
	<t>
	  The relationship of the ordering of fields within a form and
	  the ordering of returned values within "multipart/form-data"
	  was not defined by <xref target="RFC2388"/>, nor was the
	  handling of the case where a form has multiple fields with
	  the same name. Form processors given forms with a
	  well-defined ordering SHOULD send back results in the order
	  received and preserve duplicate field names, in order.
	  Intermediaries MUST NOT reorder the results.(Note that
	  there are some forms which do not define a natural order
          of appearance.
	</t>
      </section>	
      <section title="Interoperability with web applications">
	<t>
	  Many web applications use the "application/x-url-encoded"
	  method for returning data from forms. This format is quite
	  compact, e.g.:
	</t>
	<figure><artwork>
	  name=Xavier+Xantico&amp;verdict=Yes&amp;colour=Blue&amp;happy=sad&amp;Utf%F6r=Send
	</artwork></figure>
	<t>
	  however, there is no opportunity to label the enclosed
	  data with content type, apply a charset, or use other
	  encoding mechanisms.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Many form-interpreting programs (primarly web browsers)
	  now implement and generate multipart/form-data, but an
	  existing application might need to optionally support both
	  the application/x-url-encoded format as well.
	</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Correlating form data with the original form">
      <t>
	This specification provides no specific mechanism by which
	multipart/form-data can be associated with the form that
	caused it to be transmitted. This separation is intentional;
	many different forms might be used for transmitting the same
	data. In practice, applications may supply a specific form
	processing resource (in HTML, the ACTION attribute in a FORM
	tag) for each different form.  Alternatively, data about the
	form might be encoded in a "hidden field" (a field which is
	part of the form but which has a fixed value to be transmitted
	back to the form-data processor.)
      </t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
	The data format described in this document introduces no new
	security considerations outside of those introduced by the
	protocols that use it and of the component elements. It is
	important when interpreting content-disposition to not
	overwrite files in the recipients address space inadvertently.
      </t>
      <t>
	User applications that request form information from users
	must be careful not to cause a user to send information to the
	requestor or a third party unwillingly or unwittingly. For
	example, a form might request 'spam' information to be sent to
	an unintended third party, or private information to be sent
	to someone that the user might not actually intend. While this
	is primarily an issue for the representation and
	interpretation of forms themselves, rather than the data
	representation of the result of form transmission, the
	transportation of private information must be done in a way
	that does not expose it to unwanted prying.
      </t>
      <t>
	With the introduction of form-data that can reasonably send
	back the content of files from user's file space, the
	possibility that a user might be sent an automated script that
	fills out a form and then sends the user's local file to
	another address arises. Thus, additional caution is required
	when executing automated scripting where form-data might
	include user's files.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Media type registration for multipart/form-data">
      <figure><artwork>
	Media Type name:
	  multipart
	Media subtype name:
	  form-data
        Required parameters:
	   none
	Optional parameters:
	   none
	Encoding considerations:
	   No additional considerations other than as for other
	   multipart types.
	Security Considerations
           Applications which receive forms and process them must be
           careful not to supply data back to the requesting form
           processing site that was not intended to be sent by the
           recipient. This is a consideration for any application that
           generates a multipart/form-data.

	   The multipart/form-data type introduces no new security
	   considerations for recipients beyond what might occur with
	   any of the enclosed parts.

    <section title="Alternatives">
      <section title="Other data encodings rather than multipart">
	<t>
	  Various people have suggested using new mime top-level type
	  "aggregate", e.g., aggregate/mixed or a
	  content-transfer-encoding of "packet" to express
	  indeterminate-length binary data, rather than relying on the
	  multipart-style boundaries. While this would be useful, the
	  "multipart" mechanisms are well established, simple to
	  implement on both the sending client and receiving server,
	  and as efficient as other methods of dealing with multiple
	  combinations of binary data.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The multipart/form-data encoding has a high overhead and
	  performance impact if there are many fields with short
	  values. However, in practice, for the forms in use, for
	  example, in HTML, the average overhead is not significant.
	</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Remote files with third-party transfer">
	<t>
	  In some scenarios, the user operating the form software
	  might want to specify a URL for remote data rather than a
	  local file. In this case, is there a way to allow the
	  browser to send to the client a pointer to the external data
	  rather than the entire contents? This capability could be
	  implemented, for example, by having the client send to the
	  server data of type "message/external-body" with
	  "access-type" set to, say, "uri", and the URL of the remote
	  data in the body of the message.
