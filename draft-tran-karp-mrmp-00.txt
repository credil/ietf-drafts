         The Use of G-IKEv2 for Multicast Router Key Management
                        draft-tran-karp-mrmp-00

Abstract

   The G-IKEv2 key management protocol protects group traffic, usually
   in the form of IP multicast communications between a set of network
   devices.  G-IKEv2 can be used to protect the communications of
   routing protocols using a one-to-many or many-to-many communications
   model.

Internet-Draft                G-IKEv2-MRKM                  October 2011


1.  Introduction

   The G-IKEv2 protocol [I-D.yeung-g-ikev2] has been defined to
   distribute group policy and keys to a group of network devices.  It
   re-uses IKEv2 protocols, incorporating payloads similar to GDOI
   [RFC6407].  This memo describes a mode of using G-IKEv2 to protect
   routing protocols using one-to-many communication models (e.g., OSPF,
   PIM), and is known as G-IKEv2for Multicast Router Key Management
   (G-IKEv2-MRKM).

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Overview of Group Key Management

   When a group of network devices need to communicate using multicast
   communications, the devices need to share keying material and the
   policy associated with that keying material.  A group key management
   (GKM) protocol is used to securely distribute this keying material
   and associated policy.  Typically each network device (also known as
   a group member (GM)) needing to participate in the group "register"
   to a group controller/key server (GCKS), during which mutual
   authentication and authorization occur.  The GCKS also distributes
   current group policy and keying material to the group member over an
   authenticated and encrypted session.  When G-IKEv2 is used, this is
   achieved in four messages: two to setup the encrypted session
   (identical to the IKEv2 [RFC5996] IKE_INIT protocol, and two to
   authenticate, authorize, and distribute group policy to the GM
   (similar in construction to the IKEv2 IKE_AUTH protocol).

   A GKM protocol typically uses a "rekey" protocol to efficiently
   distribute replacement keying material and associated policy to GMs.
   However, this is primarly an optimization for scalability.  Because
   there are likely to be network devices communicating in a routing
   protocol, this protocol is less desirable.  In this memo, we describe
   how the group can utilize the registration protocol for both initial
   keying and rekeying purposes.

   G-IKEv2-MRKM is a GKM use case where a group of network routers
   participating in a multicast routing protocol act as GMs.  The choice
   of a GCKS is not restricted by this memo, but operationally it is
   most reliable for one of the GMs to take that role.

3.  Exchanges

   The exchange of private keying material between two network devices
   using a dedicated key management protocol is a common requirement.
   There is no need to define an entirely new protocol for routing
   protocols having this requirement when existing mature protocol
   exchanges and methods have been vetted.  This memo makes use of the
   G-IKEv2 protocol exchanges, state machine, and policy definitions
   whenever possible.  However, as G-IKEv2 was developed exclusively for
   the use of IPsec, these protocol exchanges are incorporated by
   reference into the present key protocol definitions, and are
   exchanged using a different exchange type Group Initial Exchange
   (GSA_INIT) and Group member Authentication exchange (GSA_AUTH)
   [I-D.yeung-g-ikev2].  The use of exchange type will clearly
   differentiate this protocol from IKEv2.

   The following two exchanges enable the group member to register to
   the key server to get the policy, traffic selector and keys used to
   communicate with others group member.

   The GSA_INIT exchange is a two-message exchange allows the group
   member and key server devices to negotiate cryptographic algorithms,
   exchange nonces, and do a Diffie-Hellman exchange [DH].  At the
   conclusion of the GSA_INIT, the group member (e.g., router) and key
   server can exchange private messages.  For the details of this
   exchange, refer to IKE_SA_INIT in RFC 5996.

         Group Member(Initiator)                Key Server (Responder)
        --------------------                    ----------------------
         HDR, SAi1, KEi, Ni      -->
                                 <--      HDR, SAr1, KEr, Nr, [CERTREQ,]

   Next, the group member and key server devices perform a GSA_AUTH,
   which is substancially the same as the IKE_AUTH exchange defined in
   RFC 5996, except that the SA, TSi, TSr payloads are not presented as
   policy and traffic selectors are pushed from the key server to group
   member using new payloads GSA and KD.  The IDg, SEQ, GSA, and KD
   payloads are described in Section 4 of [I-D.yeung-g-ikev2]; for the
   details of the rest of the exchange please refer to IKE-AUTH in RFC
   5996.  Section Section 4 of this document includes additional GSA
   definitions specifically for the purpose of protecting routing
   protocol traffic.

Internet-Draft                G-IKEv2-MRKM                  October 2011


         Group Member (Initiator)               Key Server (Responder)
         --------------------                   ----------------------
          HDR, SK {IDi, [CERT,] [CERTREQ,]
              [IDr,] AUTH, IDg}         -->
                                        <-- HDR, SK {IDr, [CERT,] AUTH,
                                                     SEQ], GSA, KD}

   In the GSA_AUTH exchange, the group member sends the group
   identification that it wants to join or register to.  The key server
   authenticates and authorizes the group member and pushes the policy,
   traffic selector in GSA payload, and the key in the KD payload to the
   group member.  At the successful conclusion of the GSA_AUTH exchange,
   the group member has policy and keying material to securely
   communicate with others group members that also registered with the
   key server.  With this IKEv2 SA established between GM and KS, the GM
   can request for policy and keys of an additional group using GSA_PULL
   exchange.  In GSA_PULL exchange, the GM will send group ID that it
   wants to join, the key server response will include sequence (SEQ),
   policy (GSA) and key material (KD).

         Group Member (Initiator)             Key Server (Responder)
         --------------------                 ----------------------
         HDR, SK {IDg} --
                                     <-- HDR, SK { [ SEQ ], GSA, KD}

   The group member and key server need to maintain the group
   association SA (GSA) to further communicate securely or the
   registration process above need to be repeated.  Before the policy
   and traffic key expired, the key server can use multicast GSA_REKEY
   message to PUSH the fresh policy and keys to all its group members.
   This exchange is protected by the KEK policy and key sent from the
   key server to group member during registration.  The key server will
   include sequence (SEQ), policy (GSA), and keying material (KD)
   payloads in the rekey message.  A rekey message might be necessary if
   a key lifetime is about to expire, due to concern that a key might
   have been compromised, or some other reason.

         Group Member (Initiator)         Key Server (Responder)
         --------------------             ----------------------
                                   <-   HDR, SK {SEQ, GSA, KD, AUTH}

   The KS can delete group member by sending Delete (D) payloads in the
   GSA_REKEY message .  The Delete (D) payloads are defined in Section 4
   of [I-D.yeung-g-ikev2].
      Group Member (Initiator)               Server (Responder)
      -------------------                    ------------------

                                      <--    HDR, SK {[D,] ... , AUTH}
