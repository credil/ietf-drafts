1. Introduction 

   MPLS-TP is defined as transport profile of MPLS technology to fulfill 
   the deployment in transport network. A typical feature of transport 
   network is that it can provide fast protection switching for end-to-
   end or segments. The protection switching time is generally required 
   to be less than 50ms according to the strictest requirement of 
   services such as voice, private line, etc.  

   The goal of linear protection switching mechanism is to satisfy the 
   requirement of fast protection switching for MPLS-TP network. Linear 
   protection switching means that, for one or more working transport 
   entities, there is one protection transport entity, which is disjoint 
   from any of working transport  entities, ready for taking over the 
   service transmission when a working transport entity failed. 

   This document specifies 1+1 unidirectional protection switching 
   mechanism for unidirectional transport entity (either point-to-point 
   or point-to-multipoint) as well as bidirectional point-to-point 
   transport entity, and 1+1/1:1 bidirectional protection switching 
   mechanism for point-to-point bidirectional transport entity. Since 
   bidirectional protection switching needs the coordination of the two 
   endpoints of the transport entity, this document also specifies APS 
   (Automatic Protection Switching) protocol details which is used for 
   this purpose. 

   The linear protection mechanism described in this document is 
   applicable to both LSPs and PWs. 

   The APS protocol specified in this document is based on the same 
   principles and behavior of the APS protocol designed for SONET/SDH 
   networks (i.e., it is mature and proven) and provides commonality 
   with the established operation models utilized in other transport 
   network technologies (e.g., SDH/SONET and OTN). 

   It is also worth noting that multi-vendor implementations of the APS 
   protocol described in this document already exist. 

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force 
   (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications 
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport 
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the 
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as 
   defined by the ITU-T.

2. Linear protection switching overview 

   To guarantee the protection switching time, for a working transport 
   entity, its protection transport entity is always pre-configured 
   before the failure occurs. Normally, the normal traffic will be 
   transmitted and received on the working transport entity. The 
   switching to protection transport entity is usually triggered by 
   link/node failure, external commands, etc. Note that external 
   commands are often used in transport network by operators, and they 
   are very useful in cases of service adjustment, path maintenance, etc. 

2.1. Protection Architecture Types 

   - 1+1 architecture 

   In the 1+1 architecture, a protection transport entity is associated 
   with the working transport entity. The normal traffic is permanently 
   bridged onto both the working transport entity and the protection 
   transport entity at the source endpoint of the protected domain. The 
   normal traffic on working and protection transport entities is 
   transmitted simultaneously to the sink endpoint of the protected 
   domain where a selection between the working and protection transport 
   entity is made, based on predetermined criteria, such as signal fail 
   and signal degrade indications. 

   - 1:1 architecture 

   In the 1:1 architecture, a protection transport entity is associated 
   with the working transport entity. When the working transport entity 
   is determined to be impaired, the normal traffic must be transferred 
   from the working to the protection transport entity at both the 
   source and sink endpoints of the protected domain. The selection 
   between the working and protection transport entities is made based 
   on predetermined criteria, such as signal fail and signal degrade 
   indications from the working or protection transport entity. 

   The bridge at source endpoint can be realized in two ways: it is 
   either a selector bridge or a broadcast bridge. With a selector 
   bridge the normal traffic is connected either to the working 
   transport entity or the protection transport entity. With a broadcast 
   bridge the normal traffic is permanently connected to the working 
   transport entity, and in case a protection switch is active also to 
   the protection transport entity. Broadcast bridge is recommended to 
   be used in revertive mode only.  

   - 1:n architecture

Internet-Draft Linear Protection Switching in MPLS-TP        July 2011 
    

   Details for the 1:n protection switching architecture will be 
   provided in a future version of this draft. 

   It is worth noting that the APS protocol defined here is ready to 
   support 1:n operations. 

2.2. Protection Switching Types 

   The linear protection switching types can be a unidirectional 
   switching type or a bidirectional switching type.  

   - Unidirectional switching type: Only the affected direction of 
      working transport entity is switched to protection transport 
      entity; the selectors at each endpoint operate independently.  
      This switching type is recommended to be used for 1+1 protection 
      in this document. 

   - Bidirectional switching type: Both directions of working transport 
      entity, including the affected direction and the unaffected 
      direction, are switched to protection transport entity. For 
      bidirectional switching, automatic protection switching (APS) 
      protocol is required to coordinate the two endpoints so that both 
      have the same bridge and selector settings, even for a 
      unidirectional failure. This type is applicable for 1+1 and 1:1 
      protection. 

2.3. Protection Operation Types 

   The linear protection operation types can be a non-revertive 
   operation type or a revertive operation type. 

   - Non-revertive operation: The normal traffic will not be switched 
      back to the working transport entity even after a protection 
      switching cause has cleared. This is generally accomplished by 
      replacing the previous switch request with a "Do not Revert (DNR)" 
      request, which has a low priority. 

   - Revertive operation: The normal traffic is restored to the working 
      transport entity after the condition(s) causing the protection 
      switching has cleared. In the case of clearing a command (e.g., 
      Forced Switch), this happens immediately. In the case of clearing 
      of a defect, this generally happens after the expiry of a "Wait-
      to-Restore (WTR)" timer, which is used to avoid chattering of 
      selectors in the case of intermittent defects.

3. Protection switching trigger conditions 

3.1. Fault Conditions 

   Fault conditions mean the requests generated by the local OAM 
   function. 

   - Signal Failure (SF): If an endpoint detects a failure by OAM 
      function or other mechanism, it will submit a local signal failure 
      (local SF) to APS module to request a protection switching. The 
      local SF could be on working transport entity or protection 
      transport entity. 

   - Signal Degrade (SD): If an endpoint detects signal degrade by OAM 
      function or other mechanism, it will submit a local signal failure 
      (local SD) to APS module to request a protection switching. The 
      local SD could be on working transport entity or protection 
      transport entity. 

3.2. External commands 

   The external command issues an appropriate external request on to the 
   protection process: 

   - Lockout of Protection (LO): This command is used to provide 
      operator a tool for temporarily disabling access to the protection 
      transport entity. 

   - Manual switch (MS): This command is used to provide operator a 
      tool for temporarily switching normal traffic to working transport 
      entity (MS-W) or protection transport entity (MS-P), unless a 
      higher priority switch request (i.e., LP, FS, or SF) is in effect. 

   - Forced switch (FS): This command is used to provide operator a 
      tool for temporarily switching normal traffic from working 
      transport entity to protection transport entity, unless a higher 
      priority switch request (i.e., LP) is in effect. 

   - Exercise (EXER): Exercise is a command to test if the APS 
      communication is operating correctly. The signal is chosen so as 
      not to modify the selector.  

   - Clear: This command between management and local protection 
      process is not a request sent by APS to other endpoints. It is 
      used to clear the active near end external command or WTR state.

          Figure 1 1+1 Unidirectional Linear Protection Switching 

    
   1+1 unidirectional protection switching is the simplest protection 
   switching mechanism. The normal traffic is permanently bridged on 
   both the working and protection transport entities at the source 
   endpoint of the protection domain. In normal condition, the sink 
   endpoint receives traffic from working transport entity. If the sink 
   endpoint detects a failure on working transport entity, it will 
   switch to receive traffic from protection transport entity. 1+1 
   unidirectional protection switching is recommended to be used for 
   unidirectional transport entity. 

   Note that 1+1 unidirectional protection switching does not need APS 
   coordination protocol since it only perform protection switching 
   based on the local request.

   protection transport entity. The sink endpoint receives the traffic 
   from the transport entity where the source endpoint sends on.  

   In normal condition, for each direction, the source endpoint and sink 
   endpoint send and receive traffic from working transport entity. 

   If the sink endpoint detects a failure on the working transport 
   entity, it will switch to send and receive traffic from protection 
   transport entity. It will also send an APS message to inform the sink 
   endpoint on another direction to switch to send and receive traffic 
   from protection transport entity. 

   APS mechanism is necessary to coordinate the two endpoints of 
   transport entity and implement 1:1 bidirectional protection switching 
   even for a unidirectional failure.

   This byte is used to indicate the traffic that the near end requests 
   to be carried over the protection entity: 

    value = 0 Null traffic 
    value = 1 Normal traffic 1 
    value = 2~255 Reserved 
 
 
   - Bridged signal 

   This byte is used to indicate the traffic that is bridged onto the 
   protection entity: 

    value = 0 Null traffic 
    value = 1 Normal traffic 1 
    value = 2~255 Reserved

   This bit is used to further specify the type of non-permanent bridge 
   for 1:1 protection switching:  

    value = 0 Selector bridge 
    value = 1 Broadcast bridge  
 
 
   - Reserved 

   This field should be set to zero.  

 
 
 
5.2. APS transmission  

   The APS message should be transported on protection transport entity 
   by encapsulated with the protection transport entity label. If an 
   endpoint receives APS-specific information from the working entity, 
   it should ignore this information, and should detect the Failure of 
   Protocol defect (see Section 6). 

   A new APS packet must be transmitted immediately when a change in the 
   transmitted status occurs. The first three APS packets should be 
   transmitted as fast as possible only if the APS information to be 
   transmitted has been changed so that fast protection switching is 
   possible even if one or two APS packets are lost or corrupted. The

Internet-Draft Linear Protection Switching in MPLS-TP        July 2011 
    

   interval of the first three APS packets should be 3.3ms. APS packets 
   after the first three should be transmitted with the interval of 5 
   seconds. 

   If no valid APS-specific information is received, the last valid 
   received information remains applicable. 

5.3. Hold-off timer 

   In order to coordinate timing of protection switches at multiple 
   layers, a hold-off timer may be required. The purpose is to allow a 
   server layer protection switch to have a chance to fix the problem 
   before switching at a client layer. 

   Each protection group should have a provisioned hold-off timer. The 
   suggested range of the hold-off timer is 0 to 10 seconds in steps of 
   100 ms (accuracy of +/-5 ms). 

   When a new defect or more severe defect occurs (new SF/SD) on the 
   transport entity that currently carries traffic, this event will not 
   be reported immediately to protection switching if the provisioned 
   hold-off timer value is non-zero. Instead, the hold-off timer will be 
   started. When the hold-off timer expires, it will be checked whether 
   a defect still exists on the transport entity that started the timer. 
   If it does, that defect will be reported to protection switching. The 
   defect need not be the same one that started the timer. 

   This hold-off timer mechanism shall be applied for both working and 
   protection transport entities.

   Figure 7 describes the protection switching logic.  

   One or more local protection switching requests may be active. The 
   "local request logic" determines which of these requests is highest 
   using the order of priority given in Figure 6. This highest local 
   request information is passed on to the "APS process logic". Note 
   that an accepted Clear command, clearance of SF(-P) or expiration of 
   WTR timer shall not be processed by the local request logic, but 
 
 
Zhang, et al.         Expires January 13, 2012               [Page 16] 

Internet-Draft Linear Protection Switching in MPLS-TP        July 2011 
    

   shall be considered as the highest local request and submitted to the 
   APS process logic for processing.  

   The remote APS message is received from the far end and is subjected 
   to the validity check and mismatch detection in ''APS check''. Failure 
   of Protocol situations are as follows: 

   - The ''B'' field mismatch due to incompatible provisioning; 

   - The reception of APS message from the working entity due to 
      working/protection configuration mismatch; 

   - No match in sent ''Requested traffic'' and received ''requested 
      signal'' for more than 50 ms;  

   - No APS message is received on the protection transport entity 
      during at least 3.5 times the long APS interval (e.g. at least 
      17.5 seconds) and there is no defect on the protection transport 
      entity. 

   Provided the "B" field matches: 

   - If "D" bit mismatches, the bidirectional side will fall back to 
      unidirectional switching. 

   - If the "R" bit mismatches, one side will clear switches to "WTR" 
      and the other will clear to "DNR". The two sides will interwork 
      and the traffic is protected. 

   - If the ''T'' bit mismatches, the side using a broadcast bridge will 
      fall back to using a selector bridge.  

   The APS message with invalid information should be ignored, and the 
   last valid received information remains applicable. 

   The linear protection switching algorithm commences immediately 
   every time one of the input signals changes, i.e., when the status of 
   any local request changes, or when a different APS specific 
   information is received from the far end. The consequent actions of 
   the algorithm are also initiated immediately, i.e., change the local 
   bridge/selector position (if necessary), transmit a new APS specific 
   information (if necessary), or detect the failure of protocol defect 
   if the protection switching is not completed within 50 ms. 

   The state transition is calculated in the ''APS process logic'' based 
   on the highest local request, the request of the last received 

 
 
Zhang, et al.         Expires January 13, 2012               [Page 17] 

Internet-Draft Linear Protection Switching in MPLS-TP        July 2011 
    

   ''Request/State'' information, and state transition tables defined in 
   Section 7, as follows:  

   - If the highest local request is Clear, clearance of SF(-P) or of 
      SD, or expiration of WTR, a state transition is calculated first 
      based on the highest local request and state machine table for 
      local requests to obtain an intermediate state. This intermediate 
      state is the final state in case of clearance of SF-P otherwise, 
      starting at this intermediate state, the last received far end 
      request and the state machine table for far end requests are used 
      to calculate the final state.  

   - If the highest local request is neither Clear, nor clearance of 
      SF(-P) or of SD, nor expiration of WTR, the APS process logic 
      compares the highest local request with the request of the last 
      received ''Request/State'' information based on Figure 6. 

      i) If the highest local request has higher or equal priority, it 
           is used with the state transition table for local requests 
           defined in Section 7 to determine the final state; otherwise 

      ii) The request of the last received ''Request/State'' information is 
           used with the state transition table for far end requests 
           defined in Annex A to determine the final state. 

   The ''APS message generator'' generates APS specific information with 
   the signaled APS information for the final state from the state 
   transition calculation (with coding as described in Figure 5).

   In this section, state transition tables for the following protection 
   switching configurations are described. 

   - 1:1 bidirectional (revertive mode, non-revertive mode);  

   - 1+1 bidirectional (revertive mode, non-revertive mode);  

   - 1+1 unidirectional (revertive mode, non-revertive mode). 

   Note that any other global or local request which is not described in 
   state transition tables does not trigger any state transition.  

   The states specified in the state transition tables can be described 
   as follows:

   - No request: No Request is the state entered by the local priority 
      under all conditions where no local protection switching requests 
      (including wait-to-restore and do-not-revert) are active. NR can 
      also indicates that the highest local request is overridden by the 
      far end request, whose priority is higher than the highest local 
      request. Normal traffic signal is selected from the corresponding 
      transport entity.  

   - Lockout, Signal Fail(P): The access by the normal traffic to the 
      protection transport entity is NOT allowed, due to the SF detected 
      on the protection entity or due to the lockout of protection 
      command applied. The normal traffic is carried by the working 
      transport entity, regardless of the fault/degrade condition 
      possibly present (due to the highest priority of the switching 
      triggers leading to this state). 

   - Forced Switch, Signal Fail(W), Signal Degrade(W), Signal 
      Degrade(P), Manual Switch: A switching trigger, NOT resulting in 
      the protection transport entity unavailability is present. The 
      normal traffic is selected either from the corresponding working 
      transport entity or from the protection transport entity, 
      according to the behaviour of the specific switching trigger. 

   - Wait to Restore: In revertive operation, after the clearing of an 
      SF or SD on working transport entity, maintains normal traffic as 
      selected from the protection transport entity until a wait-to-
      restore timer expires or another request with higher priority, 
      including a clear command, is received. This is used to prevent 
      frequent operation of the selector in the case of intermittent 
      failures.  

   - Do not revert: In non-revertive operation, this is used to 
      maintain a normal traffic to be selected from the protection 
      transport entity. 

   - Exercise: Exercise of the APS protocol. 

   - Reverse Request: The near end will enter and signal Reverse 
      Request only in response to an EXER from the far end.

APPENDIX A: Operation Examples of APS Protocol 

   The sequence diagrams shown in this section are only a few examples 
   of the APS operations. The first APS message which differs from the 
   previous APS message is shown. The operation of hold-off timer is 
   omitted. The fields whose values are changed during APS packet 
   exchange are shown in the APS packet exchange. They are Request/State, 
   requested traffic, and bridged traffic. For an example, SF(0,1) 
   represents an APS packet with the following field values: 
   Request/State = SF, requested signal = 0, and bridged signal = 1. The 
   values of the other fields remain unchanged from the initial 
   configuration. The signal numbers 0 and 1 refer to null signal and 
   normal traffic signal, respectively. W(A->Z) and P(A->Z) indicate the 
   working and protection paths in the direction of A to Z, respectively. 

   Example 1. 1:1 bidirectional protection switching (revertive mode) -                                                                         - 
   Unidirectional SF case

   (1) The protection domain is operating without any defect, and the 
   working entity is used for delivering the normal traffic. 

   (2) Signal Fail occurs on the working entity in the Z to A direction. 
   Selector and bridge of node A select protection entity. Node A 
   generates SF(r=1, b=1) message.

   (3) Upon receiving SF(r=1, b=1), node Z sets selector and bridge to 
   protection entity. As there is no local request in node Z, node Z 
   generates NR(r=1, b=1) message. 

   (4) Node A confirms that the far end is also selecting protection 
   entity. 

   (5) Node A detects clearing of SF condition, starts the WTR timer, 
   and sends WTR(r=1, b=1) message. 

   (6) At expiration of the WTR timer, node A sets selector and bridge 
   to working entity and sends NR(r=0, b=0) message. 

   (7) Node Z is notified that the far end request has been cleared, and 
   sets selector and bridge to working entity. 

   (8) It is confirmed that the far end is also selecting working entity.

   (2) Nodes A and Z detect local Signal Fail conditions on the working 
   entity, set selector and bridge to protection entity, and generate 
   SF(r=1, b=1) messages. 

   (3) Upon receiving SF(r=1, b=1), each node confirms that the far end 
   is also selecting protection entity. 

   (4) Each node detects clearing of SF condition, and sends NR(r=1, b=1) 
   message as the last received APS message was SF. 

   (5) Upon receiving NR(r=1, b=1), each node starts the WTR timer and
