1.  Introduction

   NETCONF [RFC6241] combined with the YANG [RFC6020] data modeling
   language provides an extensible mechanism for configuring and
   monitoring networked devices.  One of the advantages that NETCONF/
   YANG offers over other network management protocols is that it is
   flexible enough to be adapted for use with almost any service on any
   device.

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 [RFC3315] is widely
   in use for the configuration of network devices.  This document
   describes a DHCPv6 option which can be used for provisioning the
   necessary parameters to bootstrap NETCONF connectivity so that a
   device can then obtain further configuration.  An example device
   suitable for this type of configuration process would be a managed
   home gateway router.

   This document uses the terms "client" and "server" to describe the
   hosts at either end of a NETCONF connection.  "Client" should be
   understood to be the host that is actively initiating the NETCONF
   connection to the "Server".  These definitions are used to align with
   the terminology in the DHCPv6 message flow.

2.  NETCONF DHCPv6 Container Option

   The following section describes the format of the NETCONF
   configuration container option.  A container approach has been taken
   so that different NETCONF transport protocols can be supported.
   Currently only two transport protocols have been defined, NETCONF

   the future, the option could be extended to support additional
   transport protocols through the definition of new sub-options.

   Clients which implement NETCONF transport over Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) use the following sub-option to obtain configuration

   option-len  Variable
   priority    8-bit integer.  Described in Section 3.1
   dest-port   16-bit integer to be used by the client as the
               destination layer 4 port for initiating the TLS
               connection
   server-fqdn List of FQDNs to use for the NETCONF server, formatted
               according to Section 8 of [RFC3315].

   In case the client receives more than one server FQDN in the server-
   fqdn field, the client SHOULD initiate connections to the addresses
   in the order they are listed in the server-fqdn field, attempting to
   establish a connection to each server until one is successfully
   established.

3.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior

   When a device which implements both NETCONF functionality and the
   DHCP option described in this document creates a DHCPv6 SOLICIT
   message, it SHOULD include OPTION_NETCONF_CONT (TBD) within the ORO
   field.

   On receipt of an DHCP ADVERTISE response message including the
   OPTION_NETCONF_CONT option, the client evaluates the sub-options
   which it contains as follows:

   o  If OPTION_NETCONF_CONT does not contain a transport sub-option
      implemented by the client, then it MUST be discarded by the
      client.

Internet-Draft           NETCONF DHCPv6 Option              October 2013

   o  If OPTION_NETCONF_CONT contains a single NETCONF transport
      protocol sub-option implemented by the client, then the client
      SHOULD attempt establish a NETCONF session using the configured
      transport protocol.
   o  If OPTION_NETCONF_CONT contains multiple NETCONF transport
      protocol sub-options supported by the client, then the client
      SHOULD follow the procedure described below to establish a
      connection to the NETCONF server.

3.1.  Priorities

   As NETCONF is not limited to on specific transport protocol, the
   NETCONF client and/or server may have been deployed with support for
   more than one NETCONF transport protocol.

   The 'priority' field contained within the transport protocol specific
   sub-options give the service provider a method of indicating to the
   client the order in which to attempt using the different supported
   protocols to establish NETCONF connectivity.

   A client which supports two (or more) NETCONF transport protocols,
   and receives configuration parameters for at least two protocols
   SHOULD inspect the values of the priority field.  The sub-option with
   the highest priority value SHOULD be used as the first NETCONF
   protocol to attempt for establishing connectivity.

   In the event that this connection attempt is not successful, then the
   client SHOULD attempt to establish connectivity using the NETCONF
   transport protocol sub-option with the second highest priority, then
   the third highest priority, and so on until either a successful
   connection has been established, or there are no more

   In the event that the client receives two options with the same
   priority, the client SHOULD implement a mechanism for prioritising
   one mechanism over the other.  This mechanism is implementation
   specific.

4.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior

   When a DHCPv6 server receives a client SOLICIT message containing the
   OPTION_NETCONF_CONT option code within the ORO field, it SHOULD
   respond with an ADVERTISE message containing the sub-options

   If the operator has deployed their NETCONF infrastructure with
   support for more than one NETCONF transport protocol and has a
   preference for clients to use one transport protocol over another,
   then the 'priorities' field SHOULD be used within the NETCONF
   transport protocol sub-options to indicate to the client the order to
   attempt using the protocols for connectivity as described in Section
   3.1.

5.  Security Considerations

Internet-Draft           NETCONF DHCPv6 Option              October 2013


   The NETCONF protocol relies on the underlying transport protocol to
   provide security.  Security considerations described in [RFC5539] and
   [RFC6242] are also applicable to this document.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is kindly asked to allocate DHCPv6 option codes for
   OPTION_NETCONF_CONT, OPTION_NETCONF_SSH and OPTION_NETCONF_TLS.
