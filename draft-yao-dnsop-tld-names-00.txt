Internet-Draft                   tldname                    October 2012


1.  Introduction

   The new generic top-level domain (gTLD) program of ICANN will
   introduce thousands of new TLD names to the root of the domain name
   system (DNS).  Many new TLD names are the names or brands of some
   companies.  These companies may want to use these TLD names directly
   in the application.  If ABCD company has the TLD name "ABCD", this
   company may try to configure some DNS records for "ABCD" and uses it
   in some applications such as web and email.  The users might put the
   URL http://ABCD/ or http://ABCD./ in the web browser to visit ABCD's
   homepage.  The user might try to send the email to
   "administrator@abcd.".  These operations might work or not, depending
   on the different scenarios or contexts.  In order to have a good
   users' experences, some advice should be made to the TLD name owners.
   This document analyzes the TLD names usage and gives some advices.

1.1.  Terminology

   All the basic terms used in this specification are defined in the
   documents [RFC1034] and [RFC1035].


2.  Current situations for TLD names

2.1.  TLD names in the DNS zones

   TLD names are legal in the DNS zones.  The user can configure any
   records for it.

2.2.  TLD names in the DNS stub resolvers

   Different DNS stub resolvers may not always return the same result
   due to different configuration.  This is caused by what is known as
   the "search path" option.  The stub resolvers may try to search the
   TLD name adding a search path such as "example.com".  And only if the
   query gets a nonexistent domain (NXDOMAIN) response for the TLD name
   adding a search path, the stub resolver would try TLD name directly.

2.3.  TLD names in the application

   Many application protocols do not insist that domain names always be
   fully qualified.  That means that the domain names in the application
   can use single label instead of multi-labels.  But many applications
   implemented refuse to regard the TLD names as the domain names.  For
   example, for easy connection in the LAN, some users may configure the
   below record in the windows systym's hosts file.

   192.168.1.1     apple.

   then we can easily connect to apple machine via

   http://apple./
   or
   http://apple/


   The users trying to visit the homepage of apple will go to the local
   machine directly instead of trying to search the name via DNS.


3.  TLD name usage advice

   This document suggests not to configure TLD names with other RRs
   other than with NS related record in the root or TLD DNS server.  If
   the users decide to use it, they should know that TLD names might not
   be universally reachable.


4.  IANA Considerations

   There is no IANA consideration.


5.  Security Considerations

   TBD


6.  Acknowledgements

   TBD
