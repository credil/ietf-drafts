     Asserting Administrative Policies and Boundaries in DNS Zones
                draft-sullivan-zone-policy-assertions-00

Abstract

   Some security policies on the Internet depend on the idea of the
   "domain policy" or "zone policy".  It is difficult to discover such
   policies, and it is harder to do so in a way that does not subject
   operators of domains to others' assertions.  This memo describes the
   problem, and proposes a mechanism for solving it.

1.  Introduction

   [[anchor2: This document contains ideas that may have been the result
   of a visit from the bad idea fairy.  It's not really ready to read
   yet.  You have been warned. --ajs@anvilwalrusden.com]] Many network
   resources are accessed primarily by name.  DNS names make up a
   fundamental part of the name by which people or other systems access
   those network resources.  As a result, DNS names have become
   fundamental elements in building security policies and user agent
   behaviour.

   Unfortunately, most of the attempts to build useful security policies
   around DNS names work from rules of thumb that mostly work but that
   fail in ways surprising to users.  The failures are both too broad
   and too narrow: sometimes, failures prevent (or just make
   inconvenient) a desired use, while other times failures do not catch
   actual problems and permit things like cross-site scripting attacks.
   In general, the failures stem from a misunderstanding of what a
   domain name means, what a policy of "same origin" would look like,
   and what information the DNS can actually provide.

1.1.  Example cases

   o  The HTTP Cookies specification (formally known as "HTTP State
      Management Mechanism", [RFC6265]) depends on matching domain names
      and subdomains.
   o  Some web browsers have adopted a list of "public" domain names
      that are known to be delegation-centric (the publicsuffix.org
      list).
   o  Some web browsers use lists of officially-approved domain names
      near the DNS root to identify those where U-labels are to be
      displayed.  If a name is not in the list, Internationalized Domain
      Names (IDNs) are displayed.  (This is not based on the
      publicsuffix.org list, but the principle is the same.)
   o  Many clients -- especially but not only web browsers -- use a
      "same origin" policy for following links to apparently related
      content.


2.  What is the Problem?

   The use of domain names as a mechanism for identifying administrative
   boundaries is problematic for several reasons.

   1.  The Start of Authority (SOA) Resource Record marks the boundary
       of a zone, but not the boundary of administrative control.  For
       instance, the operator of example.com might delegate
       remoteoffice.example.com, inserting an SOA record at the apex of

       remoteoffice.example.com.  For legal and organizational purposes,
       everything under example.com is one administrative domain.  The
       remoteoffice.example.com delegation is only for administrative
       convenience.
   2.  The publicsuffix.org list has no mechanism (apart from manual
       updates) to ensure it remains in sync with the actual delegation
       pattern on the Internet.  It will not scale.
   3.  The publicsuffix.org list appears not to understand empty non-
       terminals.
   4.  IDN display policies that depend on the policies of domains near
       the root implicitly assume that IDN policies are transitive from
       parent to child.
   5.  Previous experiences with static lists of domain names maintained
       outside the DNS suggests that these mechanisms are fragile and
       hard to fix, particularly in the face of changes in the root
       zone.

   Scalability is a particular concern.  As of this writing, ICANN has
   plans to delegate up to 1,000 new TLDs per year as long as there is
   demand.  There is every reason to suppose that many of these will be
   IDNs, and that they will be aimed at communities that do not speak
   English nor even use Latin script, which means that volunteer-
   operated systems like publicsuffix.org will need a more diverse pool
   of volunteers.


3.  An analogy with anti-abuse systems

   The e-mail world has already struggled with the problem of mail
   senders communicating their policies, and has come up with mechanisms
   that publish records in the DNS in order to communicate those
   policies.  It seems that a similar approach might be useful for DNS
   systems themselves.

   In the e-mail technologies, the operator of a mail site publishes
   special records that are immediately below the name in question For
   the DNS, this approach will not work, because at least sometimes zone
   cuts will stand in the way of the places where one might like to put
   such information.  (In particular, where there are zone cuts and
   assertions about what happens on the other side of the cut, it is
   necessary to discover the policy on the other side is also.)
   Moreover, it is not clear that the sort of information that would be
   most helpful would fit nicely in a single DNS RR.

   Nevertheless, the basic mechanism of performing some DNS queries in
   order to find the relevant administrative policies provides a way of
   anchoring the policy in the very technology for which the policy is
   desired.  That seems better than keeping such policies in a

   repository unlinked to the systems to which the policy applies.


4.  The Mechanism

   The proposed mechanism includes two elements:

   1.  a DNS RR just below the apex of a zone in order to identify the
       policy document and a policy server;
   2.  a policy document that includes all the relevant policies for the
       zone in question, where that zone is determined by its SOA RR.

4.1.  Resource Records

   The operator of a zone that wishes to publish a policy document
   places a URI RR at the name _http._zpolicy immediately below the apex
   of the zone.

4.2.  Policy Document

   The operator of the zone provides, at the URIs in the _http._zpolicy
   RR, an XML document that provides the policy statements.  The
   document has a time to live that permits applications to cache it and
   continue using it over time.

   The policy document may include statements about the administrative
   boundaries for zones, the repertoire of Unicode characters that the
   zone permits in U-labels, and the names of zones that may be
   considered alternatives for the purposes of operation of a given
   protocol.

4.2.1.  Administrative boundaries

   [[anchor3: Here goes how the admin boundary works, how you have to
   check in more than one zone when the assertion works across zone
   cuts, and how you can short-circuit the lookup if the target of the
   URI record in one zone and another are the same thing.  Default is
   "this zone only". --ajs@anvilwalrusden.com]]

4.2.2.  Unicode Repertoire

   [[anchor4: Here goes how to express the repertoire permitted.
   Default "none". --ajs@anvilwalrusden.com]]

4.2.3.  Alternative Names

   [[anchor5: Here goes how you put configuration information for a
   service here, in order to set up the same (e.g.) mail service on

   multiple domain names.  Useful for "variants".  Default "none".

5.  Security Considerations

   Discuss the need to check across cuts to ensure that both sides
   agree.


6.  IANA Considerations

   The _zpolicy stuff needs to get registered.
