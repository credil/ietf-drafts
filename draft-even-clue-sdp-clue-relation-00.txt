Internet-Draft     SDP offer/answer and CLUE relation       October 2012


1.  Introduction

   The CLUE framework[I-D.ietf-clue-framework] is used to specify the
   infirmation needed for creating a Telepresence call.  The model
   includes the Media capture information providing information about
   content of the streams and can provide information about the spatial
   information between streams based on the capture point and area of
   capture.  A capture scene includes media captures that are part of a
   same scene e.g. room capture or presentation.

   The other infprmation defined in the framework is the Encoding
   information providing information about the abilities of the
   providers to send streams allowing a consumer to configure a capture
   to a specific encoding.

   The next sections will look at the capture attributes and the
   encoding parameter and decsribe the realtion to SDP [RFC4566].


2.  Capture attributes


3.  Encoding parameters


4.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119[RFC2119] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant RTP implementations.


5.  Acknowledgements

6.  IANA Considerations

   TBD


7.  Security Considerations

   TBD.
