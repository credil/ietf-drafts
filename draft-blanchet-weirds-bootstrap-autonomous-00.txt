1.  Introduction

   Querying and retrieving registration data from registries are defined
   in the Registration Data Access Protocol(RDAP)[I-D.ietf-weirds-rdap-
   query][I-D.ietf-weirds-using-http][I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response].
   These documents do not specify where to send the queries.  This
   document specifies a method to find which server is authoritative to
   answer queries for the requested scope.

   (author note: should it have some text on various possibilities that
   have been discussed, such as IETF84...?)

   This document proposes two different mechanisms depending on the type
   of the queried object.

   For IP addresses and autonomous system numbers, the method uses a
   Number Resource Organization(NRO) managed registry of allocations.

   For domain names, the method uses a well-known label in the top of
   the registry.

Internet-Draft      Finding Authoritative RDAP server       October 2013


   Both use the same DNS resource record(RR) which is used to locate the
   RDAP server.  The processing of the RR is discussed later in this
   document.  It should be noted that the document currently uses SRV as
   an example and it is underspecified.  When the concensus is reached
   on the method and the RR, the draft will be updated accordingly with
   the appropriate details.

2.  Domain Name Registry

   The domain names authoritative registration data servers are found by
   extracting the tld part of the queried domain name and then querying
   _rdap._tcp.tld with a DNS resource record of type SRV [RFC2782].

   For example, a RDAP query for example.com generates a DNS SRV query
   to _rdap._tcp.com.

   IDN labels are in their A-label form[RFC5891].

3.  Internet Numbers Registry

   The authoritative source is a file[NROFILE] containing the
   allocations of IP addresses and Autonomous System (AS) numbers for
   all (currently five) Regional Internet Registries(RIR).  It is
   compiled and maintained by the Number Resource Organization(NRO).
   The current format is a list of rows, where each column is separated
   by "|" (ASCII 0x7c).  The third column contains the type of the
   object and the fourth column contains the value of the object.  The
   current format does not list the URL of the RDAP server related to
   the queried resource.  However, it has been said that it can be
   augmented to provide that information.

   The file is currently large(19Moctets, 300K lines) and should not be
   queried by clients every time.  The average number of lines changed
   every day is currelty around 100.  However, there are days when 95K
   lines were changed.  The file should be cached and regularly updated.
   (author note: more to discuss on the updating/caching).

3.1.  IPv4 Address Space

   The IPv4 address space authoritative registration data servers are
   found in the file by looking for the type "ipv4" (currently in 3rd
   column) and doing a longest match on the queried prefix.  The column
   X (not currently available) provides the fully-qualified domain
   name(FQDN) of the RDAP server for that prefix.

   For example, a query for 192.9.200.0/24 looks for the longest match
   prefix in the file and then fetch the fully-qualified domain
   name(FQDN) of that prefix, for example: rdap.rirexample.net.  A DNS
   SRV record is then queried for the FQDN.

3.2.  IPv6 Address Space

   The IPv6 address space authoritative registration data servers are
   found in the file by looking for the type "ipv6" (currently in 3rd
   column) and doing a longest match on the queried prefix.  The column
   X (not currently available) provides the fully-qualified domain
   name(FQDN) of the RDAP server for that prefix.

   For example, a query for 2001:db8::/32 looks for the longest match
   prefix in the file and then fetch the fully-qualified domain
   name(FQDN) of that prefix, for example: rdap.rirexample.net.  A DNS
   SRV record is then queried on the FQDN.

3.3.  Autonomous Systems

   The Autonomous Systems (AS) authoritative registration data servers
   are found in the file by looking for the type "asn" (currently in 3rd
   column) and doing an exact match on the queried number.  The column X
   (not currently available) provides the fully-qualified domain
   name(FQDN) of the RDAP server for that AS.

   For example, a query for AS 65411 looks for the exact match AS in the
   file and then fetch the fully-qualified domain name(FQDN) of that
   prefix, for example: rdap.rirexample.net.  A DNS SRV record is then
   queried on the FQDN.

4.  Nameserver

   TBD

5.  Entity

   TBD

6.  SRV Records Processing

   TBD.  The other RR choices are: A, AAAA, CNAME, NAPTR.  See
   discussion in IETF87 for details.

7.  Querying to the Authoritative Server

Internet-Draft      Finding Authoritative RDAP server       October 2013


   After finding the authoritative server IP address, the client
   connects using the appropriate transport and application protocol to
   do the RDAP query[I-D.ietf-weirds-rdap-query].

8.  Deployment Considerations

   Caching and Updating considerations (TBD)

   RDAP server operators may use various techniques such as
   anycast[RFC4786] to manage the load on their servers.

9.  Assumptions and Limitations

   This specification assumes that the NRO is the authoritative source
   of the IPv4, IPv6 and AS numbers allocations, and that it keeps the
   file updated.

   This specification only provides a method to find RDAP servers for
   two-labels domain names.

10.  Security Considerations

   TBD

11.  IANA Considerations

   none at the moment.

12.  Acknowledgements

   The weirds working group had multiple discussions on this topic,
   including a session during IETF 84 and 87.  The ideas in this draft
   were proposed during the IETF 87 weirds session by (TBD).
