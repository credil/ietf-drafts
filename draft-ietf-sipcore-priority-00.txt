Internet-Draft     SIP Priority Header Field Registry      December 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a new IANA registry to keep track of the values
   defined for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) "Priority" header
   field.  This header field was defined in [RFC3261], section 20.26.
   It was clearly specified in a way that allows for the creation of new
   values beyond those originally specified; however, no registry has
   been established for it.


2.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds a new registry, "Priority Header Field Values."
   Its format and initial values are as shown in the following table:

                        +------------+-----------+
                        | Priority   | Reference |
                        +------------+-----------+
                        | non-urgent | RFC 3261  |
                        | normal     | RFC 3261  |
                        | urgent     | RFC 3261  |
                        | emergency  | RFC 3261  |
                        +------------+-----------+

   The policy for registration of values in this registry is "IETF
   Review," as that term is defined by [RFC5226].


3.  Security Considerations

   This document does not have any impact on the security of the SIP
   protocol.  Its purpose is purely administrative in nature.
