Internet-Draft                MILE Template                    July 2011


1.  Introduction

   Since the specification of IODEF [RFC5070], the evolution of the
   threat environment and the practice of cooperative network defense,
   along with continued implementation and deployment, has indicated the
   need for guidelines for the implementation and extension of IODEF.
   This document provides these guidelines.  It starts by describing the
   applicability of IODEF extensions, and the IODEF extension
   mechanisms, before providing a section Section 4 that is itself
   designed to be copied out and filled in as the starting point of an
   Internet-Draft about an IODEF extension.


2.  Applicability of Extensions to IODEF

   Before deciding to extend IODEF, the first step is to determine
   whether an IODEF extension is a good fit for a given problem.  There
   are two sides to this question:

   1.  Does the problem involve the reporting or sharing of information
       about an incident?  "Incident" is not defined in the terminology
       for IODEF, but for purposes of IODEF can be loosely described as
       "something that happened that has some impact on the information
       security situation of an entity", with quite a bit of leeway for
       interpretation.  If the answer to this question is unequivocally
       "No", then IODEF is probably not a good choice as a base
       technology for the application area.

   2.  Can IODEF adequately represent information about the incident
       without extension?  IODEF has a reasonably rich set of incident-
       relevant classes.  If, after examination of the problem area and
       the IODEF specification, the answer to this question is "Yes",
       then extension is not necessary.

   A non-exhaustive list of good candidate extensions to IODEF includes:

   1.  Allowing standardized reference to external information bases
       about incidents and incident-relevant information: leveraging
       existing work in describing aspects of incidents to make IODEF
       more expressive

   2.  Allowing the description of new types of entities (e.g., related
       actors) or new types of characteristics of entities (e.g.,
       financial services-related information) involved in an IODEF
       incident report

   3.  Allowing additional semantic or metadata labeling of IODEF
       Documents (e.g., for handling or disposition instructions, or

       compliance with data protection and data retention regulations)


3.  Selecting a Mechanism for IODEF Extension

   IODEF was designed to be extended through any combination of:

   1.  extending the enumerated values of Attributes, as per section 5.1
       of [RFC5070];

   2.  class extension through AdditionalData and RecordItem elements,
       as per section 5.2 of [RFC5070]; and/or

   3.  containment of the IODEF-Document element within an external XML
       Document, itself containing extension data.

   Note that in this final case, the extension will not be directly
   interoperable with IODEF implementations, and must "unwrap" the IODEF
   document from its container; nevertheless, this may be appropriate
   for certain use cases involving integration with IODEF within
   external schemas.  Extensions using containment of an IODEF-Document
   are not further treated in this document, though the document
   template in Section 4 may be of some use in defining them.

   Certain attributes containing enumerated values within certain IODEF
   elements may be extended.  For an attribute named "foo", this is
   achieved by giving the value of "foo" as "ext-value", and adding a
   new attribute named "ext-foo" containing the extended value.  The
   attributes which can be extended in this way are defined in
   [RFC5070], and limited to only these:

   o  Incident@purpose

   o  Contact@role

   o  Contact@type

   o  RegistryHandle@registry

   o  Impact@type

   o  TimeImpact@metric

   o  TimeImpact@duration

   o  HistoryItem@action

Internet-Draft                MILE Template                    July 2011


   o  Expectation@action

   o  System@category

   o  Counter@type

   o  Counter@duration

   o  Address@category

   o  NodeRole@category

   o  RecordPattern@type

   o  RecordPattern@offsetunit

   o  AdditionalData@dtype

   o  RecordItem@dtype

   An example definition of an attribute extension is given in
   Section 4.4.2.

   IODEF documents can contain extended scalar or XML data using an
   AdditionalData element or a RecordItem element.  Scalar data
   extensions MUST set the "dtype" attribute of the containing element
   to the data type to reference one of the IODEF data types as
   enumerated in Section 4.4.1, and SHOULD define the use the "meaning"
   and "formatid" attributes to explain the content of the element.

   XML extensions within an AdditionalData or RecordItem element use a
   dtype of "xml", and SHOULD define a schema for the root element
   within the AdditionalData or RecordItem attribute.  An example
   definition of an element definition is given in Section 4.4.3.


4.  Document Template

   Documents describing an IODEF extension should follow the document
   template given in this section.

4.1.  Introduction

   The introduction section introduces the problem being solved by the
   extension, and motivates the development and deployment of the
   extension.

Internet-Draft                MILE Template                    July 2011


4.2.  Terminology

   The terminology section introduces and defines terms specific to the
   document.  Terminology from [RFC5070] or [RFC6045] should be
   referenced in this section, but not redefined or copied.  If
   [RFC2119] terms are used in the document, this should be noted in the
   terminology section.

4.3.  Applicability

   The applicability section defines the use cases to which the
   extension is applicable, and details any requirements analysis done
   during the development of the extension.  The primary goal of this
   section is to allow readers to see if an extension is indeed intended
   to solve a particular problem.  This should also the scope of the
   extension, as appropriate, by pointing out any non-obvious situations
   to which it is not intended to apply.

   In addition to defining the applicability, this section may also
   present example situations, which should then be detailed in the
   examples section, below.

4.4.  Extension Definition

   This section defines the extension.

   Extensions to enumerated types are defined in one subsection for each
   attribute to be extended, enumerating the new values with an
   explanation of the meaning of the new value.  An example enumeration
   extension is shown in Section 4.4.2, below.

   Element extensions are defined in one subsection for each element, in
   top-down order, from the element contained within AdditionalData or
   RecordItem; an example element extension is shown in Section 4.4.3,
   below.  Each element should be described by a UML diagram as in
   Figure 1, followed by a description of each of the attributes, and a
   short description of each of the child elements.  Child elements
   should then be defined in a subsequent subsection, if not already
   defined in the IODEF document itself, or in another referenced MILE
   extension document.

   Elements containing child elements should indicate the multiplicity
   of those child elements, as shown in the figure above.  Allowable
   TYPEs are discussed in the following subsection.

4.4.1.  IODEF Data Types

   The allowable TYPEs for attributes within IODEF are enumerated in
   section 2 of [RFC5070], and consist of:

   o  INTEGER

   o  REAL

   o  CHARACTER

   o  STRING

   o  ML_STRING (for strings in encodings other than that of the
      enclosing document)

   o  BYTE for bytes or byte vectors in Base 64 encoding

   o  HEXBIN for bytes in ascii-hexadecimal encoding

   o  ENUM for enumerated types; allowable values of the enumeration
      must be defined in the attribute definition

   o  DATETIME for ISO 8601:2000 [RFC3339] encoded timestamps

   o  TIMEZONE for timezones as encoded in section 2.9 of [RFC5070].

   o  PORTLIST for port lists as encoded in section 2.10 of [RFC5070].

   o  POSTAL for postal addresses as defined in section 2.23 of
      [RFC4519].

   o  NAME for names of natural or legal persons as defined in section
      2.3 of [RFC4519].

   o  PHONE for telephone numbers as defined in section 2.35 of
      [RFC4519].

   o  EMAIL for email addresses as defined in section 3.4.1. of
      [RFC2822].

   o  URL for URLs as in [RFC2396].

   In addition to these simple data types, IODEF provides a compound
   data type for representing network address information.  Addresses
   included within an extension element should be represented by
   containing an IODEF:Address element, which supports IPv4 and
   [RFC2373] IPv6 addresses, as well as MAC, ATM, and BGP autonomous
   system numbers.  Application-layer addresses should be represented
   with the URL simple attribute type, instead.

4.4.2.  Example Enumerated Type Extension Definition: E.164 Address

   This example extends the IODEF Address element to support the
   encoding of ENUM-mapped telephone numbers [RFC6116].

   Attribute: Address@category

   Extended value(s): enum-e164

   Content format: An E.164 telephone number encoded as a domain name in
   the e164.int space, e.g. "2.1.2.1.5.5.5.2.1.2.1.e164.int." for +1 212
   555 1212, as per section 3.2 of [RFC6116].

   Additional considerations: none.

4.4.3.  Example Element Definition: Test

   This example defines the Test class for labeling IODEF test data.

   The Test class is intended to be included within an AdditionalData
   element in an IODEF Document.  If a Test element is present, it
   indicates that an IODEF Document contains test data, not a reference
   to a real incident.

   The Test class contains information about how the test data was
   generated.

                         Figure 2: The Test class

   The Test class has two attributes:

   category:   Required.  ENUM.  The type of test data.  The permitted
      values for this attribute are shown below.  The default value is
      "unspecified".

      1.  unspecified.  The document contains test data, but no further
          information is available.

      2.  internal.  The test data is intended for the internal use of
          an implementor, and should not be distributed or used outside
          the context in which it was generated.

      3.  unit.  The test data is intended for unit testing of an
          implementation, and may be included with the implementation to
          support this as part of the build and deployment process.

      4.  interoperability.  The test data is intended for
          interoperability testing of an implementation, and may be
          freely shared to support this purpose.

   generator:   Optional.  STRING.  A free-form string identifying the
      person, entity, or program which generated the test data.

4.5.  Examples

   This section contains example IODEF-Documents illustrating the
   extension.  If example situations are outlined in the applicability
   section, documents for those examples should be provided in the same
   order as in the applicability section.  Example documents should be
   tested to validate against the schema given in the appendix.

   from this template.  See Section 5 for Security Considerations for
   this document.]

   Any security considerations [RFC3552] raised by this extension or its
   deployment should be detailed in this section.  Guidance should focus
   on ensuring the users of this extension do so in a secure fashion,
   with special attention to non-obvious implications of the
   transmission or storage of the information represented by an
   extension.

4.7.  IANA Considerations

   [IANA and RFC-EDITOR NOTE: Despite the title, this section is NOT an
   IANA Considerations section, rather a template IANA Considerations
   section for future extension documents to be built from this
   template.  See Section 6 for IANA Considerations for this document.]

   Any IANA considerations [RFC5226] for the document should be detailed
   in this section; if none, the section should exist and contain the
   text "this document has no actions for IANA".

   IODEF Extensions adding elements to the AdditionalData section of an
   IODEF document should register their own namespaces and schemas for
   extensions with IANA; therefore, this section should contain at least
   a registration request for the namespace and the schema, as follows,
   modified as appropriate for the extension:

   Registration request for the IODEF My-Extension namespace:

     URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:iodef-myextension-1.0

     Registrant Contact: Refer here to the authors' addresses section of
   the document, or to an organizational contact in the case of an
   extension supported by an external organization.

     XML: None

   Registration request for the IODEF My-Extension XML schema:

     URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:iodef-myextension-1.0

     Registrant Contact: Refer here to the authors' addresses section of
   the document, or to an organizational contact in the case of an
   extension supported by an external organization.

     XML: Refer here to the XML Schema in the appendix of the document,
   or to a well-known external reference in the case of an extension
   with an externally-defined schema.

   The XML Schema describing the elements defined in the Extension
   Defintion section is given here.  Each of the examples in section
   Section 4.5 should be verified to validate against this schema by
   automated tools.
