INTERNET-DRAFT                                           TRILL over PWE3


1. Introduction

   The IETF has standardized the TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of
   Lots of Links) protocol [RFC6325] that provides optimal pair-wise
   data frame routing without configuration in multi-hop networks with
   arbitrary topology. TRILL supports multipathing of both unicast and
   multicast traffic. Devices that implement TRILL are called TRILL
   Switches or RBridges (Routing Bridges).

   End stations are attached to TRILL switches with Ethernet. But links
   between TRILL switches can be based on arbitrary link protocols, for
   example PPP [RFC6361], as well as Ethernet [RFC6325]. A set of
   connected TRILL switches form a TRILL campus which is bounded by end
   stations and layer 3 routers. Such a campus may contain bridges.

   This document specified the use of two types of PWE3 (Pseudowire
   Emulation End-to-End) pseudowires as links between TRILL switches. It
   is assumed that such pseudowires are implemented with MPLS.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                           TRILL over PWE3


2. PWE3 Interconnection of TRILL Switches

   PPP [RFC4618] or Ethernet [RFC4448] pseudowires may be used to
   interconnect pairs of TRILL switch ports as described below. The
   pseudowire between such ports can be auto-configured [RFC4447] or
   manually configured. The TRILL switches, which are TRILL routers, are
   also acting as label switched routers for those TRILL switch ports.

   In both types, the pseudowire provides transparent transport and the
   two RBridges appear directly interconnected with a transparent link.
   With such an interconnection (and negotiation to use TRILL in the PPP
   case [RFC6361]), the TRILL adjacency over that link is automatically
   discovered and established through TRILL IS-IS control messages
   [RFC6325] [RFC6327].



2.1 PWE3 Type Independent Details

   The sending pseudowire TRILL switch port MUST copy the priority of
   the TRILL packets being sent to the 3-bit Class of Service field of
   the pseudowire label [RFC5462] so the priority will be visible to
   transit devices that can take the priority into account.

   If a pseudowire supports fragmentation and re-assembly, there is no
   reason to do TRILL MTU testing on it and the pseudowire will not be a
   constraint on the TRILL campus wide Sz (see Section 4.3.1 [RFC6325]).
   If the pseudowire does not support fragmentation, then the available
   TRILL IS-IS packet payload size over the pseudowire (taking into
   account MPLS encapsulation with a control word) or some lower value,
   MUST be used in helping to determine Sz (see Section 5
   [ClearCorrect]).

   An intervening MPLS label switched router or similar device has no
   awareness of TRILL. Such devices will not change the TRILL Header hop
   count.



2.2 TRILL over PPP PWE3

   For a PPP pseudowire (PW type = 0x0007), the two TRILL switch ports
   being connected are configured to form a pseudowire with PPP
   encapsulation [RFC4618]. After the pseudowire is established and
   TRILL use is negotatied within PPP, the two TRILL switches then
   appear directly connected with a PPP link [RFC1661].

   Behavior for TRILL with a PPP pseudowire continues to follow that of
   TRILL over PPP as specified in Section 3 of [RFC6361].

INTERNET-DRAFT                                           TRILL over PWE3


2.3 TRILL over Ethernet PWE3

   For an Ethernet pseudowire, the two TRILL switch ports being
   connected are configured to form a pseudowire with Ethernet
   encapsulation [RFC4448].  The ports MUST use the Raw mode (PW type =
   0x0005) and non-service-delimiting, to provide as transparent an
   Ethernet transport as practical. The two RBridges then appear
   directly interconnected with an Ethernet link [RFC6325].

   Behavior for TRILL with an Ethernet psuedo wire continue to follow
   that over Ethernet as specified in [RFC6325] and [RFC6327].



2.4 Preferable Pseudowire Type And Auto-Configuration

   Use of the PPP pseduowire type is preferable to the Ethernet
   pseudowire type for the connections discussed in this document.  It
   saves 12 or 16 bytes on every TRILL packet. In particular, the Link
   Header in the PPP case is simply a 2-byte PPP code point while for
   the Ethernet case it is 14 or 18 bytes (Outer.MacDA (6), Outer.MacSA
   (6), sometimes Outer.VLAN (4), and TRILL Ethertype (2)). (While it
   would also be possible to specify a special custom pseudowire type
   for TRILL traffic, the authors feel that any efficiency gain over PPP
   pseudowires would be too small to be worth the complexity of adding
   such a specification.)

   If pseudowire interconnection of two TRILL switch ports is auto-
   configured [RFC4447] and the initiating RBridge port supports PPP
   pseudowires, it SHOULD initially attempt the connection set-up with
   PW type PPP (0x0007). If that pseudowire type is rejected, it SHOULD
   try again with the Ethernet PW type recommended above (0x0005) if it
   supports that type. If a responding RBridge port receives a set-up
   attempt specifying PPP, it SHOULD accept the connection if it
   supports PPP. If a responding RBridge port receives a set-up attempt
   specifying Ethernet (PW type = 0x0005), it SHOULD assume that the
   initiator does not aupport PPP and accept or reject the Ethernet set-
   up attempt depending on whether or not it supports Ethernet. SHOULD
   is specified because local policy as to what pseudowires connections
   and types are allowed may override these guidelines.

3. IANA Considerations

   No IANA action is required by this document. RFC Editor: Please
   remove this section before publication.



4. Security Considerations

   For general TRILL protocol security considerations and those related
   to Ethernet links, see [RFC6325].

   For PPP link TRILL security consideraitons, see [RFC6361].

   For security considerations introduced by carrying Ethernet or PPP
   TRILL links over pseudowires, see [RFC3985].

   Not all implementations need to include specific security mechanisms
   at the pseudowire layer, for example if they are designed to be
   deployed only in cases where the networking environment is trusted or
   where other layers provide adequate security.  A complete enumeration
   of possible deployment scenarios and associated threats and options
   is not possible and is outside the scope of this document.  For
   applications involving sensitive data, end-to-end security should
   always be considered, in addition to link security, to provide
   security in depth.
