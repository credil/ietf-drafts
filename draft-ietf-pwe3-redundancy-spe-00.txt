Internet-Draft            PW redundancy on S-PE            December 2012


1.  Introduction

   [RFC6718] describes the framework and requirements for pseudowire
   (PW) redundancy, and [I-D.ietf-pwe3-redundancy-bit] specifies
   Pseudowire (PW) redundancy mechanism for scenarios where a set of
   redundant PWs is configured between provider edge (PE) nodes in
   single-segment pseudowire (SS-PW) [RFC3985]applications, or between
   terminating provider edge (T-PE) nodes in multi-segment pseudowire
   (MS-PW) [RFC5659] applications.

   In some MS-PW scenarios, there are some benefits to provide PW
   redundancy on S-PEs, such as reducing the burden on the access T-PE
   nodes, and faster protection switching.  This document describes some
   scenarios in which PW redundancy is provided on S-PEs, and specifies
   the operations of the S-PEs.  Signaling of the preferential
   forwarding status as defined in [I-D.ietf-pwe3-redundancy-bit] is
   reused.  This document does not require any change to the T-PEs of
   MS-PW.


2.  PW Redundancy on S-PE

   In some MS-PW deployment scenarios, there are some benefits to
   provide PW redundancy on S-PEs.  This section gives some examples of
   PW redundancy on S-PE.

                        Figure 1.MS-PW Redundancy on S-PE

   As illustrated in Figure 1, CE1 is connected to T-PE1 while CE2 is
   dual-homed to T-PE2 and T-PE3.  T-PE1 is connected to S-PE1 only, and
   S-PE1 is connected to T-PE2 and T-PE3.  The MS-PW is switched on
   S-PE1, and PW-Seg2 and PW-Seg3 provides resiliency on S-PE1 for
   failure of T-PE2 or T-PE3 or the connected ACs.  PW-Seg2 is selected
   as primary PW segment, and PW-Seg3 is secondary PW segment.

   MS-PW redundancy on S-PE is beneficial for the scenario in Figure 1
   since T-PE1 as an access node may not be able to provide PW

   redundancy, especially when the PW-Seg1 between T-PE1 and S-PE1 is
   statically configured.  And with PW redundancy on S-PE, the number of
   PW segments needed between T-PE1 and S-PE1 is only half of the number
   of PW segments needed for end-to-end MS-PW redundancy.  In addition,
   PW redundancy on S-PE could provide faster protection switching than
   end-to-end protection switching of MS-PW.

          Figure 2. MS-PW Redundancy on S-PE with S-PE protection

   As illustrated in Figure 2, CE1 is connected to T-PE1 while CE2 is
   dual-homed to T-PE2 and T-PE3.  T-PE1 is connected to S-PE1 and
   S-PE2, and both S-PE1 and S-PE2 are connected to T-PE2 and T-PE3.
   There are two MS-PWs which are switched at S-PE1 and S-PE2
   respectively to provide S-PE node protection.  For MS-PW1, the S-PE1
   provides resiliency using PW1-Seg2 and PW1-Seg3.  For MS-PW2, the
   S-PE2 provides resiliency using PW2-Seg2 and PW2-Seg3.  MS-PW1 is the
   primary PW and PW1-Seg2 is the primary PW segment.

   MS-PW redundancy on S-PE is beneficial for the scenario in Figure 2
   since it reduces the number of end-to-end MS-PWs required for both
   T-PE and S-PE protection.  In addition, PW redundancy on S-PE could
   provide faster protection switching than end-to-end protection
   switching of MS-PW.


3.  S-PE Operations

   For an S-PE which provides PW redundancy, it is important to

Internet-Draft            PW redundancy on S-PE            December 2012


   advertise proper preferential forwarding status to the PW segments on
   both sides and perform protection switching according to the received
   status.  This section specifies the operations of S-PEs on which PW
   redundancy is provisioned.  This document does not make any change to
   the T-PEs of MS-PW.

   The S-PE SHOULD work as a Slave node for the single-connected side,
   and SHOULD work in Independent mode for the multi-connected side.
   The S-PE SHOULD pass the preferential forwarding status received from
   the single-connected side unchanged to the PW segments on the multi-
   connected side.  The S-PE SHOULD advertise Standby status to the
   single-connected side if it receives Standby status from all the PW
   segments on the multi-connected side, and it SHOULD advertise Active
   status to the single-connected side if it receives Active status from
   any of the PW segments on the multi-connected side.  For the single-
   connected side, the active PW segment is determined by the T-PE on
   this side, which works as the Master node.  On the multi-connected
   side, the PW segment which has both local and remote Preferential
   Forwarding status as Active SHOULD be selected for traffic
   forwarding.

   The Signaling of Preferential Forwarding bit defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-redundancy-bit] is reused in these scenarios.

   For the scenario in Figure 1, assume the AC from CE2 to T-PE2 is
   active.  In normal operation, S-PE1 would receive Active Preferential
   Forwarding status bit on the single-connected side from T-PE1, then
   it would advertise Active Preferential Forwarding status bit on both
   PW-Seg2 and PW-Seg3.  T-PE2 and T-PE3 would advertise Active and
   Standby preferential status bit respectively to S-PE1, reflecting the
   forwarding state of the two ACs to CE2.  By matching the local and
   remote Up/Down status and Preferential Forwarding status, PW-Seg2
   would be used for traffic forwarding.

   On failure of the AC between CE2 and T-PE2, the forwarding state of
   AC on T-PE3 is changed to Active.  T-PE3 then advertises Active
   Preferential Status to S-PE1, and T-PE2 would advertise the
   Preferential Status bit of Standby to S-PE1.  S-PE1 would perform the
   switchover according to the updated local and remote Preferential
   Forwarding status, and select PW-Seg3 for traffic forwarding.  Since
   S-PE1 still connects to an Active PW segment on the multi-connected
   side, it will not advertise any change of the PW Preferential
   Forwarding status to T-PE1.  T-PE1 would not be aware of the
   switchover on S-PE1.

   For scenario of Figure 2, assume the AC from CE2 to T-PE2 is active.
   T-PE1 works in Master mode and it would advertise Active and Standby
   Preferential Forwarding status bit respectively to S-PE1 and S-PE2.

Internet-Draft            PW redundancy on S-PE            December 2012


   According to the received Preferential Forwarding status bit, S-PE1
   would advertise Active Preferential Forwarding status bit to both
   T-PE2 and T-PE3, and S-PE2 would advertise Standby Preferential
   Forwarding status bit to both T-PE2 and T-PE3.  T-PE2 would advertise
   Active Preferential Forwarding status bit to both S-PE1 and S-PE2,
   and T-PE3 would advertise Standby Preferential Forwarding status bit
   to both S-PE1 and S-PE2, reflecting the forwarding state of the two
   ACs to CE2.  By matching the local and remote Up/Down Status and
   Preferential Forwarding status, PW1-Seg2 from S-PE1 to T-PE2 would be
   used for traffic forwarding.  Since S-PE1 connects to the Active PW
   segment on the multi-connected side, it would advertise Active
   Preferential Forwarding status bit to T-PE1, and S-PE2 would
   advertise Standby Preferential Forwarding status bit to T-PE1 since
   it does not have any Active PW segment on the multi-connected side.

   On failure of the AC between CE2 and T-PE2, the forwarding state of
   AC on T-PE3 is changed to Active.  T-PE3 would then advertise Active
   Preferential Forwarding status bit to both S-PE1 and S-PE2, and T-PE2
   would advertise Standby Preferential Forwarding status bit to both
   S-PE1 and S-PE2.  S-PE1 would perform the switchover according to the
   updated local and remote Preferential Forwarding status, and select
   PW1-Seg3 for traffic forwarding.  Since S-PE1 still has an Active PW
   segment on the multi-connected side, it would not advertise any
   change of the PW status to T-PE1.  Thus T-PE1 would not be aware of
   the switchover on S-PE1.

   If S-PE1 fails, T-PE1 would notice this through some detection
   mechanism and then advertise the Active Preferential Forwarding
   status bit to S-PE2, and PW2-Seg1 would be selected by T-PE1 for
   traffic forwarding.  On receipt of the newly changed Preferential
   Forwarding status, S-PE2 would advertise the Active Preferential
   Forwarding status to both T-PE2 and T-PE3.  T-PE2 and T-PE3 would
   also notice the failure of S-PE1 by some detection mechanism.  Then
   by matching the local and remote Up/Down and Preferential Forwarding
   status, PW2-Seg2 would be selected for traffic forwarding.


4.  VCCV Considerations

   PW VCCV [RFC5085] CC type 1 "PW ACH" can be used with S-PE redundancy
   mechanism.  VCCV CC type 2 "Router Alert Label" is not supported for
   MS-PW as specified in [RFC6073].  If VCCV CC type 3 "TTL Expiry" is
   to be used, the hop count from one T-PE to the remote T-PE needs to
   be obtained in advance.  This can be achieved either by control plane
   SP-PE TLVs or through data plane tracing of the MS-PW.
