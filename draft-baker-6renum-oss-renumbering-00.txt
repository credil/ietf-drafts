1.  Introduction

   This document comments briefly on the use of an Operational Support
   System to renumber all or part of a network.

   When the question of renumbering a network, discussed previously in
   [RFC1900], [RFC1916], [RFC2071], [RFC2072], [RFC2874], [RFC2894],
   [RFC4076], [RFC4192], and [RFC5887], came up yet again in the IETF,
   the author's comment, besides pointing to the issues raised in The
   [RFC4192], was to comment that renumbering is a special case of
   numbering; what we really need to figure out is how to manage
   addresses and prefixes in an IPv4 [RFC0791] or IPv6 [RFC2460]
   network.  This includes how to allocate them, how to assign them, how
   to recover or remove them, and how to change them, in a way that
   supports the service being offered.  The IP MIB [RFC4293] provides at
   least three information elements, ipAdEntAddr, ipAddressAddr, and the
   ipAddressPrefixEntry, that can be used to read or set the address or
   prefix in use on an interface.  Naively, the tools exist to add,
   change, or delete an address or prefix from an interface in IPv4 or
   IPv6 given a network management system using SNMP or Netconf that can
   manipulate them.

   The "Procedures for Renumbering an IPv6 Network without a Flag Day"
   [RFC4192] started from an honest question on the part of its authors.
   The authors asserted that a procedure could be written (and proceeded
   to write one) to renumber a network without a flag day.  The
   essential element required to maintain service during the change is
   to never actually change an address or prefix; instead, one adds a
   new address or prefix, ensures that it is useful in naming and
   routing, and only then removes the old.  Fully believing that
   competent operators could figure this out, the authors then asked a
   number of operators: "what are we missing?"  What we were missing, in
   short, was human ignorance, laziness, and misplaced creativity; we
   assumed that given tools with which to manage a network, people would
   use them.  People in fact take dramatic shortcuts like manually
   configuring addresses in places that don't really call for that,
   neglecting to look up names, and ignoring lifetimes on data, with the
   result that a reasonable operational change can be ineffective.
   [RFC4192] was then updated to point to the many and wondrous ways in
   which people not only shoot themselves in the foot, but, taking
   careful aim, shoot their toes off individually.

   This note does not pretend to fix the problem of human creativity.
   It does, however, discuss how one might implement the procedure of
   [RFC4192] in one's Operational Support System in a reasonable way.

2.  Using the OSS for address and prefix management

2.1.  What is an Operational Support System?

   An Operational Support System, or OSS, is a software system that
   supports the operation of a network.  It often includes one or more
   databases storing information about subscribers, employees, billing
   history, service history, equipment, interconnections, contracts, and
   configurations.  It often has broad simplifications that enable one
   to operate a business.  In a residential broadband network, for
   example, it will not attempt to describe each subscriber as having a
   separate contract; it will instead describe several classes of
   contracts, and for each subscriber indicate what type of contract
   they have.  It will likely not have the exact configuration of each
   piece of equipment in the network; what it will have are methods to
   create that configuration from its databases (which may, of course,
   be cached), and methods to make specific changes to configurations
   when appropriate.

2.2.  Implementing RFC 4192

   The steps considered in [RFC4192] fall broadly into two categories:

   o  adding a new prefix to a network or a part of the network, and

   o  removing an old prefix from that network or part of a network.

   The steps are taken in succession: one adds a new prefix, and then
   removes an old one; if they care conducted at the same time, a
   variety of failure modes can set in.  It is possible, of course to
   divide the network into regions and renumber them individually, but
   in each region the renumbering is done by adding and subsequently
   dropping.  The interval between the major phases is also arbitrarily
   long: one might add a prefix, wait a year, during which one uses
   multiple prefixes, and then remove one of them.

   To add a prefix to a network, one takes several steps:

   1.  Initial condition: the network and its services are operating and
       supporting services with one or more prefixes.

   2.  Add the prefix to the routing system, including a prefix on each
       LAN (and therefore a subnet), advertised in routing.

   3.  Add an address in the added prefix to each host in the domain;
       this might be done using DHCP [RFC2131] [RFC3315] or Stateless
       Address Autoconfiguration [RFC4862][RFC4941] by making the new
       prefix a "preferred" prefix.

   4.  As interfaces acquire their new addresses, add resource records
       to DNS enabling systems to use them.

   5.  Resulting condition: the network and its services are operating
       and supporting services with the original set of prefix(es) plus
       the new one.

   To remove a prefix from a network, one takes a corresponding series
   of steps:

   1.  Initial condition: the network and its services are operating and
       supporting services with two or more prefixes.

   2.  Remove resource records using the legacy prefix from DNS, causing
       new accesses to services to use the prefixes not being removed.

   3.  Wait until the lifetime advertised in DNS expires and normal
       access using the legacy addresses to complete; hosts may continue
       using cached information for that interval.

   4.  Remove the indicated addresses from the routing domain; this
       might be done using DHCP [RFC2131] [RFC3315] or Stateless Address
       Autoconfiguration [RFC4862][RFC4941] by making the prefix no
       longer be "preferred".

   5.  Remove the prefix from the routing system.

   6.  Resulting condition: the network and its services are operating
       and supporting services with the remaining prefix(es).

   [RFC4192] recommends delays in between the various steps comparable
   to at least the lifetimes of information currently in use; hosts
   should not generate addresses that the routing system cannot support,
   DNS should not advertise addresses that the routing system cannot
   route to or which do not have hosts instantiating them, and the
   administration needs to enable a service to use an address until that
   address's advertised lifetime has expired.  It also recommends
   testing; the fact that one has removed an address from DNS and the
   lifetime has expired does not imply that every session started within
   the lifetime has ended.  The next procedural step should only be
   taken when there is no reasonable expectation that the information
   remains in use legitimately.

2.3.  Renumbering using an OSS

   It is hard to generalize about OSS's, as they are generally custom-
   built to support a specific business or kind of business.  However, a
   few assumptions may hold reasonably generally:

   o  It is likely built on a database,

   o  Individual objects, such as subscriber entries, can have sets of
      attributes, such as IPv4 or IPv6 addresses or prefixes,

   o  The database provides methods that can observe a change to an
      object's attributes and perform related changes, and send messages
      to systems as needed.

   For example, in a residential broadband network, the database might
   know that a set of customers are attached to the same interface on a
   given router, and as a result know that they should be configured
   with an address or prefix within each of a set of addresses or
   prefixes.  The database will contain an object that corresponds to
   the router's interface and has a set of attributes including a set of
   subscribers, a set of IPv4 prefixes, and a set of IPv6 prefixes.  The
   database method that adds a prefix to the set of prefixes on a
   router's interface will

   o  Add the prefix to the list

   o  Execute a method that configures the corresponding ipAdEntAddr,
      ipAddressAddr, and ipAddressPrefixEntries in the actual router.

   o  Execute a method that configures each listed subscriber with an
      address or prefix from the new one.

      *  This method may in turn execute a method that configures the
         corresponding ipAdEntAddr, ipAddressAddr, and
         ipAddressPrefixEntries in the subscriber equipment.

      *  If it elects to let DHCP do the configuration, at some point
         later the subscriber will ask the DHCP server to execute a
         similar method that populates information elements in the DHCP
         response.

   One could imagine further hierarchy: On operator might divide his
   network up into regions that use a specified prefix, such as in OSPF
   Areas, and have a method that recursively uses the method just
   described to add a prefix to each LAN interface in the area.  That
   would be useful if the operator simply wants to add a prefix.  If the
   operator additionally wants to reorganize his area, such as
   subdividing it into smaller areas or combining or dividing subnets,
   that will likely be at least in part a manual procedure.
