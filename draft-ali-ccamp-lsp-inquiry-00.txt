   Abstract 

   RSVP-TE reoptimization procedure for Packet Switch Capable (PSC) 
   tunnels and non-PSC tunnels has some differences. This document 
   highlights these differences, describes how existing procedures can 
   be used for reoptimization of non-PSC tunnels and proposes some 
   enhancements for reoptimization of non-PSC tunnels.

   forwarding states for each LSP. That is, existing and reoptimization 
   LSPs may be simultaneously active in both control and data planes. 
   However, for many non-PSC technologies label itself represents the 
   underlying physical resource and hence cannot be shared between 
   existing and reoptimization LSPs in the data plane. Consequently, 
   for many non-PSC technologies, reoptimization LSPs can only be 
   instantiated in the control plane. Furthermore, reoptimization LSP 
   is not immediately available to carry any traffic and requires 
   additional signaling for its activation in the data plane. 
    
   In this document, inquiry refers to a way to signal sharing of 
   resources (e.g., labels, links) between the existing and 
   reoptimization LSPs in the control plane without installing any 
   forwarding states in the data plane (e.g., without installing cross-
   connections). In most non-PSC networks, inquiry step is required to 
   access feasibility and characteristics of the reoptimization LSP 
   before committing data plane resources and moving traffic to it. 
   This is especially true of scenarios when route computation is not 
   performed by ingress Label Edge Router (LER). These include (but are 
   not limited to): 
      .  LSPs with loose hops in the Explicit Route Object (ERO), e.g. 
        inter-domain LSPs.   

      .  Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) User-
        Network Interface (UNI) where route computation may be 
        performed by the (server layer) core Label Switch Router (LSR) 
        [RFC4208]; 

   In such cases, ingress LER may like to inquire about feasibility and 
   attributes of a better path. Cost, TE metrics and SRLG values are 
   examples of attributes that ingress LER may like to inquire about 
   (e.g., before making a reoptimization decision). Procedures 
   specified in [ID.SRLG-RECORDING] and [ID.METRIC-RECORDING] may be 
   used for this purpose.  
    
   Reoptimization is an example where inquiry procedure is needed. 
   However, inquiry is also useful for other use cases, e.g., for 
   probing purposes. Hence, for the generalization purposes, LSP 
   signaled during inquiry is referred as inquiry LSP. Reoptimization 
   LSP is an example of inquiry LSP.

   Inquiry LSP may be signaled with or without resource locking in the 
   control plane. This is detailed in the following.  

   1.1. Inquiry with Resource Locking 

      Signaling inquiry LSP with resource locking is depicted in Figure 
      1. Specifically, Path message (Path1) is signaled such that 
      resource activation is Data Plane (DP) is skipped. However, 
      inquiry LSP reserves resources in the Control Plane (CP), i.e., 
      resources/ labels are locked/ committed in the control plane. 
      Nonetheless, resources/ labels are still shared with the existing 
      LSP(s) belonging to the tunnel inquiry LSP belongs to.

   By the time Resv1 for the initial Path message (Path1) is received 
   by the ingress LER, the ingress LER knows about feasibility and the 
   requested attributes of the inquiry LSR. Please note that to ensure 
   resource locking at the right priority, inquiry LSP needs to be 
   signaled using the same setup and hold priority as existing LSP. 

   After finding feasibility and the requested attributes of the 
   inquiry LSP, the ingress LER evaluates inquiry LSP. E.g., if the 
   inquiry LSP is signaled for reoptimization purposes, the ingress LER

   determines if it would like to reoptimize the existing LSP. If 
   ingress LER decides not to reoptimize existing LSP, it deletes the 
   inquiry LSP (by sending Path tear message -                                             - this option is not shown 
   in Figure 1). However, if the ingress LER decides to reoptimize the 
   tunnel to use the inquire LSP, it initiates activation of the 
   inquiry LSP in the data plane (as shown by Path2 and Resv2 signaling 
   loop in Figure 1). How ingress LER moves traffic from existing LSP 
   to inquire LSP for reoptimization purpose is beyond the scope of 
   this document.  

   1.2. Inquiry without Resource Locking 

   When inquiry is performed with resource locking, the resources used 
   by the inquiry LSP are locked in control plane and cannot be used by 
   any LSP other than the LSP(s) belonging to the same tunnel (of 
   course resource preemption based on setup and hold priority of the 
   inquiry LSP is still possible). This limits network availability in 
   the event of a failure, especially when inquiry is used frequently, 
   e.g., for probing purposes. This issue can be addressed by signaling 
   inquiry LSP without resource locking. In this case, the resources 
   used by the inquiry LSP are not locked in control plane and can be 
   used by any LSP, including the existing LSP(s) belonging to the same 
   tunnel. Therefore, if inquiry LSP is signaled without resource 
   locking, additional signaling is required to first lock the 
   resources in the control plane, before the LSP can be activated in 
   the data plane. This is depicted in the following Figure.

          Figure 2: Inquiry LSP Signaling without Resource Locking 
    

   Initial Path message (Path1) is signaled such that resource locking 
   in control plane and resource activation is data plane is skipped. 
   By the time Resv1 for the initial Path message (Path1) is received 
   by the ingress LER, the ingress LER knows about feasibility and the 
   requested attributes of the inquiry LSR. The inquiry LSP evaluation 
   process works in the same fashion as discussed in Section 1.1.  

   As Path1 is signaled without resource locking, there is no guarantee 
   that the resources for the inquiry LSP will be available when 
   ingress LER decides to activate the inquiry LSP. Therefore, the 
   ingress LER first signals a path change (Path2) to lock the resource 
   in the control plane before inquiry LSP can be activated in the data 
   plane.  

   2. RSVP-TE signaling procedure 

   This section describes the signaling procedure for LSP inquiry with 
   and without resource locking. 

   2.1. RSVP-TE Signaling for Inquiry with Resource Locking 

      [RFC6001] specifies procedure for signaling Soft Forwarding 
      Adjacency (Soft FA). It defines the Pre-Planned LSP flag in the 
      Attribute Flags TLV, which can be carried in an LSP_ATTRIBUTES 
      object defined in [RFC5420]. The Pre-Planned LSP flag can also be 
      used to signal inquiry LSP with resource locking.  

      The processing rules for the Pre-Planned LSP flag are unchanged 
      from [RFC6001]. The procedures for the processing the Attribute 
      Flags TLV are also unchanged from [RFC5420]. The following 
      description is provided to help describe usage of the Pre-Planned 
      LSP flag in the context of signaling the inquiry LSP. Example of 
      Figure 1 is used to describe the usage.

      Internet Draft      draft-ali-ccamp-lsp-inquiry-00.txt 


         .  Path1 message in Figure 1 is sent with the Pre-Planned LSP 
           flag set to 1. As per [RFC6001], this enables provisioning 
           of inquiry LSP in control plane only. In order to enable 
           sharing if resources within the same tunnel, Path1 message 
           is sent with shared explicit reservation style [RFC3209].  

         .  In order to activate inquiry LSP in the data plane, Path2 
           message (please see Figure 1) is sent with the Pre-Planned 
           LSP flag set to 0. 

   2.2. RSVP-TE Signaling for Inquiry without Resource Locking 

         In order to indicate signaling of an LSP without resource 
      provisioning in neither control plane nor data plane, a new flag 
      in the Attribute Flags TLV, which can be carried in an 
      LSP_ATTRIBUTES Object, is defined as follows: 

         .  Pre-Planned LSP Without Resource Locking flag (to be 
           assigned by IANA, recommended bit position TBD) 

         The Pre-Planned LSP Without Resource Locking flag is 
      meaningful on a Path message. The procedure for the processing 
      the Attribute Flags TLV follows [RFC5420]. The flag is used as 
      described in the following.  

       

         .  If the Pre-Planned LSP Without Resource Locking flag is set 
           to 1, the transit nodes SHOULD NOT reserve resources 
           required by the LSP in the control plane and MUST NOT 
           install any forwarding states associated with the LSP in the 
           data plane. However, all LERs and LSRs are required to 
           remember the resource (labels, links, etc.) assignments and 
           the RSVP-TE states associated with this LSP. These resources 
           are not locked and hence can be claimed by anther LSP. If 
           the Pre-Planned LSP Without Resource Locking flag is set to 
           1, the Pre-Planned LSP flag MUST be ignored. In our example 
           of Figure 2, Path1 message is sent with the Pre-Planned LSP 
           Without Resource Locking flag set to 1.  

         .  If the Pre-Planned LSP Without Resource Locking flag is set 
           to 0 and the Pre-Planned LSP flag is set to 1, the transit 
           nodes MUST commit resources associated with the LSP in the 
           control plane. However, if a resource is already claimed by 
           another LSP, the processing LSR/ LER MUST send a Path Error 
           with code: "Admission Control Failure (1)" and subcode "LSP 
           Admission Failure (4) and Path State Removal flag. A

      Internet Draft      draft-ali-ccamp-lsp-inquiry-00.txt 


           processing LSR/ LER MUST NOT install any forwarding states 
           associated with the LSP in the data plane. Path2 message in 
           Figure 2 is sent with the Pre-Planned LSP Without Resource 
           Locking flag set to 0 and the Pre-Planned LSP flag is set to 
           1. It is RECOMMENDED that no other modifications be made to 
           other RSVP objects during this operation (signaling Path2).  

         .  Activation of LSP in data plane follows the procedure 
           specific in [RFC6001]. E.g., Path2 message in Figure 2 is 
           sent with the Pre-Planned LSP flag set to 0. 

   3. Security Considerations 

      This document does not introduce any additional security issues 
      above those identified in [RFC5920], [RFC2205], [RFC3209], and 
      [RFC3473] and [RFC4874].  

   4. IANA Considerations 

   4.1. RSVP Attribute Bit Flags 

         The IANA has created a registry and manages the space of 
      attributes bit flags of Attribute Flags TLV as described in 
      section 11.3 of [RFC5420]. It is requested that the IANA makes 
      assignments from the Attribute Bit Flags defined in this 
      document. 

         This document introduces the following new Attribute Bit Flag: 

            - Bit number: TBD 

            - Defining RFC: this I-D 

            - Name of bit: Pre-Planned LSP Without Resource Locking 
      Flag
