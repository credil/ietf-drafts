    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML) Schema for
   Reverse DNS Management in a tightly controlled Representational State Transfer (REST)  <xref target="REST"></xref> environment. This document describes a schema that has been developed and deployed by ICANN in a "RESTful" based system since 2011 and is being used by the registries responsible for reverse DNS (rDNS) delegations underneath IN-ADDR.ARPA <xref target="RFC1034"></xref> and IP6.ARPA <xref target="RFC3152"></xref> through an X.509 <xref target="RFC5280"></xref> certificate mediated HTTPS <xref target="RFC2818"></xref> transaction.  
      </t>

      <t> As DNSSEC <xref target="RFC4033"></xref>  adoption progresses the necessity to interact with a delegation in the IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.APRA zones becomes more frequent given that updates to DS records in the parent zone for child delegations follow the key rollover and expiry of the child zone. The modification of such critical areas at a relative high frequency requires a system that allows the administrative holders of such delegations to make such changes in a secure and trustworthy manner where the chain of trust for submitting the necessary information remains unbroken between the IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.APRA zone maintainers and the zone customers.  </t>

<t>At the request of the Regional Internet Registries to automate reverse DNS updates with ICANN, a REST based HTTPS service was deployed that:</t>
<t><list style="symbols">
      <t>Provides for a secure authenticated mechanism to update zone data (NS and DS records)</t>
	<t>Provides a well-formed data structure for both the IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA zones</t>
	<t>Allows for "out of band" acknowledgement and notification of updates</t>
</list></t>

    </section>

    <section title="Implementation">
	<t>The implemented system allows the entity responsible for its rDNS delegations to effect changes in the reverse DNS zones IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA by submitting an XML document to an atomic RESTful service via a HTTPS <xref target="RFC2818"></xref> connection. In this service the HTTPS layer provides the end-to-end security of the transaction and it further provides authentication by use of mandatory X.509 <xref target="RFC5280"></xref> client certificates with a known server certificate issued by a Certificate Authority administered by the service operator.</t>

	<t> Certificates for use in this system, issued by the system operator, are specific to the entity responsible for the delegations in the zone.</t>

	<t> Updates are made to the system by using the HTTP <xref target="RFC2616"></xref> GET, PUT, and DELETE operations over HTTP 1.1 <xref target="RFC2616"></xref> via HTTPS <xref target="RFC2818"></xref> only. These operations are sent to a resource Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) in the form of:</t>

	            ]]></artwork>

      </figure>

	<t>A synthetic example of an XML document (in RelaxNG Compact <xref target="RELAXNG"></xref> format) submitted to the deployed system might take the following form (including all optional attributes) as per the schema in <xref target="update-schema" />.</t>

<zone xmlns="http://download.research.icann.org/rdns/1.1"

  </ds>
</zone>
	            ]]></artwork>

      </figure>

	<t> When PUT and DELETE operations are used, the well formed XML is required to be sent with the appropriate content-length headers. The GET operation requires only the URI.</t>

	<t>One requirement of the system was to allow the separation of update and approval with an out of band notification mechanism. When such options are configured for a customer of the service, submitted updates may be queued for later approval. When a customer has queued updates pending approval, the customer may submit a GET request to retrieve either an individual entry, or a full listing of all queued entries.</t>

	<t>To fetch a listing of the customer's queue the customer would 'GET' a URI in the form of:</t>
		<figure align="center">

        <artwork align="left"><![CDATA[
	https://host.example.org/queuelist
	            ]]></artwork>

      </figure>

	<t>To fetch an individual queue entry the customer would 'GET' the canonical URL (as per the schema) for this queue record:</t>
		<figure align="center">

        <artwork align="left"><![CDATA[
	https://host.example.org/queue/<identifier>
	            ]]></artwork>

      </figure>

	<t>Were "identifier" is a system generated and system specific value that identifies this particular queue entry. All XML returned from from queue based operations ('queue' and 'queuelist') would return an XML document following the specification in <xref target="q-schema" />. A synthetic example from a GET of 'queuelist' would be:</t>

      <t>This document provides an XML schema for facilitating the management of reverse DNS delegations in the IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.APRA zones. The schema itself contains no authentication data and all other information contained is considered public data as it is either published in DNS, or propagated to other public information sources like WHOIS.</t>

	<t>The system which implements this XML schema requires HTTPS to be used and also uses known server and client X.509 certificates for authentication to protect against message modification, message insertion/deletion, man-in-the-middle, and replay attacks. Authorisation for which delegations the X.509 certificate authentication sessions can affect are out of scope of this document, along with any denial of service type attack vectors.</t>

      <t>An XML schema was initially provided by APNIC, however necessity required a branch and as such a new namespace and schema has been created. Recognition goes to APNIC for prior efforts in this area.</t>
