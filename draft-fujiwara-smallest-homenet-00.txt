Abstract

   This document tries to describe a configuration difficulty of complex
   networks and two example solutions.  Although access control for home
   servers is very important, managements and setups of access controls
   are difficult for ordinary users.  One of solutions is to limit
   smallest home network inside a L2 link and the smallest home network
   uses link-local address only.  The other solutions uses ULA (Unique
   Local Address).

Internet-Draft              smallest homenet                    Oct 2012


1.  Introduction

   The homenet architecture [I-D.ietf-homenet-arch] treats large,
   complex home networks.  There may not be network experts to manage
   home networks.  Considering simple and small home network is useful.

1.1.  Problem statement

   The access control to home network servers is very important.
   Managements and setups of access controls are difficult for ordinary
   users.  "Connecting a new node to the same link", or "connecting a
   new node to the same link and push a button" are easiest way to
   configure the new node that can relate the new node with a home
   server.

1.2.  Possible solution

   According to a home network scale, there are some solutions.

   o  Single link, smallest case: there is a L2 link.  Connecting the
      link means that the new node can access servers.  Access control
      can be attained by using a Link-Local addresses.  It is described
      in Section 2.

   o  Multiple links, using ULA case: Access control can be attained by
      using a ULA addresses.

   o  Using global address case: It is the same as enterprise network
      operation.

   o  A few links: multiple smallest case, ULA case, or global address
      case.

2.  Smallest homenet using Link-Local address

   Suppose there is only a link in a home.  It may be common for
   ordinary users.  Link-Local addresses are able to point entities in
   the network.  Servers within the smallest home network serve services
   to clients using link-local address only.  Clients to access the
   servers are connected the network.  Other communications are not
   affected by this proposal.

   Smallest homenet server will accept requests from link-local
   addresses.  Smallest homenet server should reject requests from
   another addresses.  Smallest homenet server may act a normal IPv6
   client.

   Smallest homenet clients need to treat link-local address correctly.

   They can cache server information with symbolic name and link-local
   address.  They will act as normal IPv6 nodes (They get IPv6 prefixes
   from CPEs, They can connect to the internet via CPEs).

   Name resolutions inside the smallest network may be performed by
   "ICMPv6 Node Information" DNS Name query or another methods.  Name
   resolution in a smallest homenet may be performed by IPv6 Node
   Information Queries [RFC4620].  The problem is that the protocol is
   an EXPERIMENTAL.

3.  Multiple smallest homenet

   Smallest homenet servers may have multiple interfaces.

5.  IANA considerations
