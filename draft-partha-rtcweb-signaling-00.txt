Abstract

   The standardization of Real time communication between browsers is to
   provide the infrastructure for audio, video, text communication using
   standard interface so that interoperable communication can be
   established between any compatible browsers.  RTCWeb specific
   Javascript API will be provided by browsers for developing real-time
   web application.  It is possible to develop signaling protocol like
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) or Jingle or websocket extension or
   custom-made signaling protocol in Javascript.  There are lots of
   issues in Javascript based signaling protocol.  This document list
   the need for standard signaling protocol between RTCWeb client
   (browser) and RTCWeb server and possible signaling protocol for the
   same.

1.  Introduction

   The standardization of Real time communication between browsers is to
   provide the infrastructure for audio, video, text communication using
   standard interface so that interoperable communication can be
   established between any compatible browsers.  The detail overview of
   RTCweb is available at [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview], RTCWeb usecase and
   requirements are illustrated in
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-use-cases-and-requirements], RTP usage for RTCWeb is
   explained at [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage] and security consideration
   is mentioned in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security]

   RTCWeb specific Javascript API will be provided by browsers for
   developing real-time web application.  It is possible to develop
   signaling protocol like Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261]
   or Jingle [Jingle] or Websocket [I-D.ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol]
   extension or HTTP [RFC2616] custom-made signaling protocol in
   Javascript.

   Having said that, this document provides insight about the limitation
   of custom made RTCWeb signaling protocol, need for standard RTCWeb
   signaling protocol and the possible solutions for the same.

               Fig 1: RTCWeb signaling protocol architecture

   In the above mentioned architecture, this document focus on
   standardizing RTCWeb signaling between browser and RTCWeb server


3.  Issues without RTCWeb standard signaling protocol

   The issues in creating non standard RTCWeb sigaling protocol are

   o  Without RTCWeb standard signaling protocol, each website developer
      has to understand the complication of signaling protocol for
      making the real-time communication.
   o  Downloading the complete RTCWeb signaling protocol Javascript is
      inefficient as it impact performance and setup delay of real-time
      communication.  The caching of Javascript shall avoid downloading
      the signaling protocol in each time RTCWeb server is accessed.
      But the Javascript cache is possible to be removed often which
      leads to the impact.
   o  Also, browser has to download each website signaling protocol
      indepentely

   o  Plugin is efficient as standard signaling protocol but defeat the
      purpose of RTCWeb charter


4.  Standard RTCWeb signaling protocol advantages

   The defining signaling protocol is not a hindrance for any innovative
   RTCWeb signaling protocol development as it is complementary
   solution.  The issues mentioned in non-existence of RTCWeb signaling
   protocol is overcome by having standard RTCWeb signaling protocol.
   The other advantages related to standard RTCWeb sigaling protocol are
   as follows:

   o  RTCWeb developer has no need to know the intricacies of signaling
      protocol for developing RTCWeb application.  The effort involved
      in making voice or video chat by each web developer shall be
      overcome by providing standard signaling in RTCWeb client
   o  Gateway for RTCWeb server and legacy signaling protocol is easy in
      case standard RTCweb signaling protocol is used.
   o  More efficient in case of browser having native RTCWeb signaling
      protocol in browser


5.  RTCWeb Protocol requirement and design consideration

   Some of the RTCWeb signaling protocol requirement and design
   considerations are as follows

   o  The mechanism has to create two way communications between RTCWeb
      server and RTCweb client
   o  The mechanism has to provide the way to pass description about the
      media transmission between two RTCweb clients
   o  The mechanism has to support the secure transmission of signaling
      information
   o  The authentication between RTCweb client and RTCweb server has to
      be supported

   TBD: Complete list has to be mentioned.

   The following criteria has to discussed in detail for the protocol
   selection

   o  Signaling routing intelligence in RTCWeb client or only in RTCWeb
      server
   o  RTCWeb client has to maintain the state of the communication or
      not (intelligent vs. dumb)

Internet-Draft              RTCWeb signaling                October 2011


   o  SDP [RFC4566] has to be used for media description or not
   o  Offer/answer [RFC3264] mechanism has to be supported in RTCWeb
      client or not
   o  Signaling protocol has to address only basic two party
      communication or more scenarios has to be taken into account
   o  User Identity has to be managed in RTCWeb client or not
   o  TBD: ???


6.  Possible RTCWeb signaling protocols

   The following Signaling protocols will qualify for becoming standard
   RTCWeb signaling protocol

   1.  Jingle
   2.  Websocket with SDP offer/answer
   3.  SIP
   4.  SIPLite [I-D.cbran-rtcweb-protocols]
   5.  Websocket with custom XML
   6.  Megaco [RFC5125]
   7.  Websocket with SIP [I-D.ibc-rtcweb-sip-websocket]
   8.  HTTP with custom XML
   9.  ???

   TBD: Pros and cons for each of the signaling mechanism has to be
   added


7.  Conclusion

   The collection of more signaling requirements & design consideration,
   analysis of those constraints with the list of possible RTCWeb
   signaling protocol will lead to the selection of best signaling
   protocol for RTCweb


8.  Security Considerations

   The selected RTCWeb signaling protocol has to meet all the security
   consideration in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security].  There is no specific
   security consideration associated with this draft.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This is no IANA consideration for this specification
