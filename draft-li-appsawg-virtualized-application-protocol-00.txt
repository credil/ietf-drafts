Internet-Draft                     VAP                        March 2012


1.  Introduction

   The basic idea of the Virtualized Application is that, the applicaion
   is running on the network server, the network server sends screen
   streams to the user device, the user can use a client on the device
   to view the screen streams.  And the client can capture the user's
   interaction with the application and send the user interactivity to
   the network server.  The network server renders user interactivity on
   the hosted application.  In this way, the user can remotely consume
   various applications without installing the applciations on the user
   device.

   Virtualized Application Protocol aims to provide a new application
   consumption model with the following functionalities:

   o  OS-Independent applications: This enables users to use
      applications irrespective of the Operating System they are using.
      This will increase the application availability for users and vice
      versa.

   o  On-line applications: This allows users to use applications online
      instead of downloading them on to their devices.  This will allow
      users to overcome terminal barriers (e.g memory) and accessing
      virtualized applications from any terminal at any time.

   o  No-loss reconnection: This enables users to reconnect to an
      abnormally suspended virtualized application session without
      application data being lost.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Motivation

   With the advancement of high profile applications (e.g games) and
   various available platforms, the service consumption is becoming
   complex and difficult.  The number of devices available with
   different hardware and software specification is making things worse.
   Applications are being developed for a particular platform and with
   strict hardware and software requirements.  These constraints mostly
   proved to be a hurdle for the complete value chain:






Li                      Expires September 5, 2012               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                     VAP                        March 2012


   o  Users can only use applications which are compliant to their
      device hardware and software platform specification.

   o  Content providers have to create multiple versions of the
      application depending on which hardware and software platform they
      want them to execute on.

   o  Despite of knowing this inconvenience of their users and partnered
      Content Provider, service providers can't do much to help their
      subscribers.

   In an attempt to solve the problem, this protocol attempts to
   optimize the current application usage model by providing a unified
   platform (cloud computing platform) which can host various
   applications, enabling different content and services, remotely in
   the cloud and provide them to the user using virtualization
   techniques (cloud computing).

   This will aid end-user to use virtualized applications irrespective
   of the platform they are using with consistent user experience as
   compared to using applications hosted locally on the device.  The
   user only needs to install Virtualized Application Client on his/her
   device.  In addition to that, developers don't have to create a
   different version (for each mobile OS) of a single application, and
   service providers can offer a larger selection of applications and
   services to their end-users reducing costs.


3.  Use Cases

3.1.  Online Application Trials

   This use case describes how a user can try-out the application
   remotely on the server-side without first downloading them on his/her
   device.

   Note: There might be another use case when a user want to suspend and
   resume an application session voluntarily.

3.1.1.  Short Description

   Alice goes to a SP (App Store) searching for an application related
   with racing games.  She found one application which cost about $20.
   Considering the cost Alice went into dilemma whether to buy that
   application or not.  She found a button saying "On-line Trial&#8127;
   she clicked that button and a window popped-up on her mobile device
   in which the games got initialized instantly.  She tried that game,
   played for about 10-15 minutes and decided to go for that game.  She

Internet-Draft                     VAP                        March 2012


   then went for the download/buy process.

3.1.2.  Market benefits

   Alice doesn't have to first choose, buy, download, install, run, play
   the game and then in case she doesn't like it uninstall, probably ask
   for refund and then again start from choosing another game.  Instead,
   she can go for online trial, make up her mind and then buy and
   download the game.

3.2.  OS-independent application

   This use case describe how a user can use any application
   irrespective of the device platform he/she is using and the device
   platform the application is built for.  This is achieved by hosting
   applications on the network-side and allowing users to use that
   application remotely from their terminal.

3.2.1.  Short Description

   Alice is having a device with Symbian OS.  She goes to an App Store
   with an intention to buy an application.  She liked an application
   but found that the application is for Andriod device only.  She was
   also provided with an option to use that application from any OS i.e
   "Online Subscription&#8127; Alice found it feasible to go for this
   option and successfully subscribed for the "Online Subscription&#
   8127;for that application.  Now Alice can use this application online
   as and when required irrespective of the OS that she is using.

3.2.2.  Market benefits

   User doesn't have to take their device platform in consideration
   while choosing a suitable application of their needs.  Developers
   don't have to create different version (for each mobile OS) of a
   single application.

3.3.  Application session suspend resume

   This use case describes how a user can reconnect to the UVE enabled
   services in case of an unexpected connection failure.  This also
   explains what user can get (or expect) at the reconnection.

3.3.1.  Short Description

   Alice is using a UVE enabled application.  Alice is allowed to save
   the application state at any time.

   At some point of time after getting disconnected, due to any reason



Li                      Expires September 5, 2012               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                     VAP                        March 2012


   (e.g bad network), Alice tries to reconnect with the application.  At
   the reconnection, Alice is provided with an option to reload the
   application from one of the saved states.  Alice then continues using
   the application from that state.

   It is possible that Alice did not save the application.  In this
   case, at reconnection, Alice continues using the application from the
   point where she was disconnected.

3.3.2.  Market benefits

   This will enable service continuity for users.

4.2.  Virtualized Application Client

   Virtualized Application Client is a device side component residing in
   the terminals enabling virtualized applications and utilizing
   virtualization technology to enable underlying operating system
   agnostic applications.  It is mainly responsible for:

   o  Output rendering: On receiving Output Stream form Virtual Machine,
      Virtualized Application Client renders Output Stream to the user.

   o  Interaction provisioning: Virtualized Application Client is also
      responsible to transfer interactions commands to the Virtual
      Machine, where they get executed on the Virtualized Application
      Client.

   o  Local Resource Provisioning: Virtualized Application Client is
      responsible for providing local resource to Virtual Machine as per

Internet-Draft                     VAP                        March 2012


      the client requirements.  Client may use local device APIs to get
      the Local Resource data.

4.3.  Virtual Machine

   Virtual Machine is a server side component emulating different
   operating systems and responsible for::

   o  Application Hosting: The basic responsibility of Virrual Machine
      is to host the Virtualized Applications.  The Virtualized
      Application can be hosted on Virtual Machine dynamically at
      runtime or they can be pre-configured.

   o  Output generation: Virtual Machine is the entity which will
      actually interact with Virtualized Application Client in the
      Virtualized Application session.  One of the main responsibilities
      of Virtual Machine is to capture the application display
      periodically and creating a single video stream (Output Stream) to
      be transferred to Virtualized Application Client.  Where, that
      will be rendered to the user by Virtualized Application.

   o  Local Resource Rendering: Virtual Machine is responsible to
      provide Local Resource data (received from Virtualized Application
      Client) to the Virtualized Application.

   o  Interaction Execution: Virtual Machine is responsible to execute
      interaction commands on the Virtualized Application.


5.  Virtualized Application Protocol

   Virtualized Application Protocol is a standardized protocol defined
   in this draft, to exchange request/response between Virtualized
   Application Client and Virtual Machine.  The message exchanges
   include:

   o  Application Session Request: Client can request an application
      session with the Virtual Machine.  The parameters may include:
      screen coordinate, device capability, mouse action (left click,
      right click, scroll down, scroll up), keyboad keys, compass.

   o  Output Stream Response: Virtual Machine sends application output
      streams to the Virtualized Application Client.  It can be based on
      the stream transmission protocols, for example, RTSP.

   o  Sesssion Suspend Request/Response: Client can request to suspend
      an application session, and Virtual Machine should keep the
      application state and send response to Client.

Internet-Draft                     VAP                        March 2012


   o  Session Resume Request/Response: Client can request to rwsume an
      application session, and Virtual Machine should keep the
      application state and send response to Client.

   The request/response can be transmitted over HTTP, and the format can
   be XML or JSON.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo currently includes no request to IANA.


7.  Security Considerations

   User should be authenticated and authorized to consume the
   Virtualized Applications hosted on the Virtual Machine.
