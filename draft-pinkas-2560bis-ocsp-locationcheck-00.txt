Abstract

   RFC 2560 [RFC2560] allows CAs to designate one or more OCSP 
   Responders for being responsible to provide the revocation status 
   of the certificates they issue under a given CA key.

INTERNET DRAFT      OCSP LocationCheck extension      September 25, 2012

   This document introduces a new feature that allows allows CAs to 
   split the workload between different sets of OCSP Responders in a 
   way that is analogous to the way CRLs can be split between 
   different sets of CRL issuers (using the cRLDistributionPoints 
   extension).

   This new feature allows a CA to designate one or more OCSP 
   Responders for being responsible to provide the revocation status 
   for a subset of the certificates they issue under a given CA key. 

   This document defines a critical extension that may only be placed 
   in an OCSP certificate and the way it shall be processed by OCSP 
   clients.

1.  Introduction

   CAs may indicate in the certificates they issue the location of one 
   or more Authorized OCSP Responders.  In such a case, they include in 
   these certificates an AIA extension with an accessMethod which 
   contains the id-ad-ocsp OID as well as the location of the OCSP 
   Responder(s) in the accessLocation field.

   Each OCSP Responder is able to demonstrate that it is an Authorized 
   OCSP Responder because:

       - it got an OCSP certificate which includes both the ocspSigning 
         OID in the extended key usage extension and the 
         digitalSignature bit in the key usage extension; and 

       - the key that was used to sign the OCSP certificate is the same 
         as the key that was used to sign the target certificate.

   In RFC 2560 [RFC2560], OCSP clients have now way to make sure which 
   OCSP Responder is behind a given URI.  OCSP Responses can be 
   interchanged, since all OCSP Responders are equally trusted.

INTERNET DRAFT      OCSP LocationCheck extension      September 25, 2012


   When using CRLs, CAs designating CRL issuers have a way to split 
   the CRLs so that a given CRL issuer is only responsible for a subset 
   of the issued certificates: they use the cRLDistributionPoints 
   extension.

   In RFC 2560 [RFC2560], there is no similar functionality.  Every 
   OCSP Responder that has been initially designated by the CA must 
   continue to be responsible to indicate the revocation status for 
   every certificate issued by the CA under the key that was used to 
   sign their OCSP certificate.

   The consequence is that every OCSP Responder must provide the 
   revocation status of all certificates issued under a given CA key 
   (even when millions of certificates are issued).

   Since it is not possible to add new fields in the AIA extension 
   (when it contains an accessMethod which itself contains the 
   id-ad-ocsp extension), in order to allow a client to make sure that 
   an OCSP Response comes from the right URI, a new extension is 
   defined.  It may only be included in an OCSP certificate. 

   The OCSP LocationCheck extension allows an OCSP client to verify 
   that an OCSP Response comes from an URI that is indicated in the 
   accessLocation field from target certificate to be verified (which 
   is part of the AIA extension when the accessMethod contains the 
   id-ad-ocsp OID).

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


   2. Text to be placed in section 4.5 (Extensions)

4.5.X OCSP LocationCheck extension

   This single extension MAY only be placed in an OCSP certificate.

   The identifier for this extension is id-pkix-ocsp-locationcheck, 
   while the value is LocationCheck.

   id-pkix-ocsp                 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ad-ocsp } 
   id-pkix-ocsp-locationcheck   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix-ocsp X }

   LocationCheck ::=  GeneralName

   This extension SHALL be set critical.

INTERNET DRAFT      OCSP LocationCheck extension      September 25, 2012


   This extension is not relevant to path processing, i.e. it SHALL be 
   ignored when building a certification path up to a trusted root.

   When this extension is encountered by an OCSP client in an OCSP 
   certificate and if it cannot be understood by an OCSP client, then 
   the OCSP certificate SHALL be considered as invalid. 

   When this extension is encountered by an OCSP client in an OCSP 
   certificate and if it is recognized by an OCSP client, the OCSP 
   client SHALL compare the URI included in the accessLocation field of 
   the target certificate (which is part of the AIA extension when the 
   accessMethod contains the id-ad-ocsp OID) with the content of the 
   LocationCheck.  The comparison SHALL be done using the 
   dualStringMatch matching rule, as defined in X.520 [X.520] in 
   section 14.8.2.

   If they match, then the OCSP client may proceed with further checks. 

   If they don't match, then the OCSP client SHALL consider the OCSP
   certificate as invalid and SHALL consider the whole OCSP Response as 
   invalid.

   3. Text to be placed in the Security Considerations section 

5.X. OCSP LocationCheck extension

   In RFC 2560 [RFC2560], OCSP clients have no way to make sure which 
   OCSP Responder is behind a given URI.  OCSP Responses can be 
   interchanged, since all OCSP Responders are equally trusted.

   When an OCSP Responder is only responsible for a subset, OCSP 
   Responders are no more equally trusted.  OCSP clients need to make 
   sure that the OCSP Responder was indeed authorized for a given 
   certificate. 

   The OCSP LocationCheck extension allows an OCSP client to verify 
   that an OCSP Response comes from an URI that is indicated in the 
   accessLocation field from target certificate to be verified (which 
   is part of the AIA extension when the accessMethod contains the 
   id-ad-ocsp OID).

4.  Security Considerations

   The text covering the security considerations is provided in 
   Section 3.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
