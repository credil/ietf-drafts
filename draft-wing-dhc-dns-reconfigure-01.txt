                   DHCPv6 Dynamic DNS Reconfiguration
                   draft-wing-dhc-dns-reconfigure-01

Abstract

   Some networks are expected to support IPv4-only, dual-stack, and
   IPV6-only hosts at the same time.  This makes prioritizing the DNS
   servers for hosts tricky due to a heterogeneous mix of protocol
   stacks causing optimal behavior to occur only when the host stack re-
   initializes.  The networks infrastructure is usually well equipped to
   be aware of single/dual-stack nature of hosts.  This specification
   extends DHCPv6 so that a DHCPv6 Relay Agent can dynamically influence
   the priority of DNS servers provided to the host, so that the host
   can use an optimal DNS server for resolution.

1.  Introduction

   The default address selection rules [RFC6724] prefers IPv6 over IPv4.
   If a dual-stack host is configured to use a DNS64 server, that DNS64
   server will synthesize a AAAA response if there is an A record.
   Thus, the dual-stack host will always use IPv6 if a DNS lookup was
   involved, even if IPv4 could have been used more optimally.  If NAT44
   and NAT64 are deployed on the same network, it is preferable to use
   NAT44 over NAT64 because of scale, performance and application
   incompatibility issues (e.g., FTP) [RFC6384].  At the same time,
   native IPv6 can still be preferred over IPv4.  The DHCPv6 Relay Agent
   can observe host characteristics on a network to determine if the
   host is IPV4-only, dual-stack or IPV6-only and also determine
   transitions from single to dual-stack or vice-versa.  In this
   document we propose a specification that allows the DHCPv6 Relay
   Agent to influence the DHCPv6 Server to send appropriately
   prioritized DNS Servers to the client as per host characteristics.

Internet-Draft          dynamic_dhc_dns_reconfig               June 2013


   DNS server : DNS server using an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address (that is,
   an IPv6 address starting with ::ffff:/96 IPv4-mapped prefix).  Hosts
   can communicate with the DNS server only using IPv4 packets
   [RFC6052], section 4.2.

   DNS64 server : DNS server using an IPv6 address and synthesizes AAAA
   records from A records [RFC6147]

3.  Mechanism

   This document describes a new DHCPv6 Option that can be used with the
   DHCPv6 RECONFIGURE_REQUEST [I-D.ietf-dhc-triggered-reconfigure] by
   the DHCPv6 Relay Agent to indicate to the DHCPv6 Server of the
   priority of DNS servers to be provided to the specified host.  The
   DHCPv6 Server then sends a Reconfigure message to the host providing
   updated/re-ordered DNS server list as suggested by the Relay Agent.
   The idea is for the DHCPv6 Relay Agent to dynamically send the
   reconfigure message based on host characteristics.

   1.  *IPv6-only transition to Dual-Stack* : In case a host is
       IPv6-only to start off, it is provided a DNS64 Server.  When
       transitioning to dual-stack, an IPv4 DNS Server is assigned as a
       consequence of obtaining an IPv4 Address.  The DHCPv6 Relay Agent
       can detect this and send a RECONFIGURE_REQUEST message to the
       DHCPv6 Server indicating that the host needs to be provided with
       a regular DNS Server followed by DNS64 server.  In lieu of this
       mechanism, the host would continue to use the DNS64 server until
       the host stack reinitializes.

   2.  *Dual-Stack to IPv6-only* : In case a host is dual-stack, it is
       provided with a regular DNS server followed by DNS64 server.
       When transitioning to IPv6-only, the DHCPv6 Relay Agent can
       detect this and send a RECONFIGURE_REQUEST message to the DHCPv6
       Server indicating that the host needs to be assigned a DNS64
       server only.  In lieu of this mechanism, the host would continue
       to use the regular DNS Server which is inaccessible and
       eventually time out to fail over to the DNS64 Server.  The host
       will take additional time to fully initialize causing delays in
       connection.

   3.  *Dual-Stack to IPv4-only* : In case a host is dual-stack, it is
       provided with a regualr DNS server followed by DNS64 server.
       When transitioning to IPv4-only, no change is required because
       the host continues to use regular DNS server.

4.  DNS_RECONFIG option

   The DNS_RECONFIG option is to be used only in a RECONFIGURE_REQUEST
   message and identifies the query being performed.  The option
   includes a flag that determines the DNS server list to be provided by
   the DHCPv6 server to the respective client.

   The option is defined below:

    0                   1                   2                     3

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  OPTION_DNS_RECONFIG          | Option-len                    |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Info-flags   |                                               |
   -----------------------------------------------------------------


    OPTION_DNS_RECONFIG : 16-bit option code
    Option-length       : 16-bit unsigned integer indicating length
                          in octets of this option

    Info-flags          : Flag indicating the type of DNS Server
    +------+--------------------------------
    |Value | Name                          |
    +------+--------------------------------
    | 0x01 | IPV6_DNS64_SERV_ONLY          |
    | 0x02 | IPV6_HIGH_PROI_NORM_SERV      |
    +------+--------------------------------

    IPV6_DNS64_SERV_ONLY - Provide only DNS64 address list to the client.

    IPV6_HIGH_PROI_NORM_SERV - Provide DNS address list in this order to the client,
                               first regular DNS servers and then DNS64 servers.

5.  DHCPv6 Relay Agent Behaviour

   DHCPv6 relay agents that implement this specification MUST be
   configurable for sending the RECONFIGURE_REQUEST message.  The Relay
   Agent MUST set the "msg-type" field to RECONFIGURE_REQUEST.  The
   Relay Agent detects host characteristics using mechanisms discussed
   in Section 7.  For host transition from IPv6-only to dual-Stack or
   IPv4-only to dual-stack Relay Agent will set Info-flags with
   IPV6_HIG_PROI_NORM_SERV and for host transition from dual-stack to
   IPv6 only Relay-Agent will set Info-flags with IPV6_DNS64_SERV_ONLY.

6.  DHCPv6 Server Behaviour

   Upon receiving RECONFIGURE_REQUEST message containing the
   DNS_RECONFIG Option, the DHCPv6 server processing is described below
   depending on the Info-flag values:

   o  *IPV6_DNS64_SERV_ONLY* : The DHCPv6 server will select only IPv6
      address list of DNS64 recursive name servers to be sent to the
      client.  The DHCPv6 server will send a reconfigure message to
      inform the client that the server has updated configuration
      information and the client initiates an Information-request with
      the server.  The updated configuration will now be sent as part of
      Information-request reply by the DHCPv6 server.

   o  *IPV6_HIGH_PROI_NORM_SERV* : The DHCPv6 server will select DNS
      servers in this order, first is the regular DNS servers and then
      DNS64 servers.  The DHCPv6 server will send a reconfigure message
      to inform the client that the server has updated configuration
      information and client initiates an Information-request with the
      server.  The updated configuration will now be sent as part of
      Information-request reply by the DHCPv6 server.  The order of DNS
      servers provided by option OPTION_DNS_SERVERS determines the
      preference for use by the DNS client resolver [RFC3646] thus
      ensuring higher priority for regular DNS server list followed by
      DNS64 servers.

   DHCPv6 server will use the mechanism described in
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-triggered-reconfigure] to create and send Reconfigure
   message.  The server will remember this configuration for the life of
   the lease.

7.  Host Tracking

   Relay Agents can actively keep track of all IPv4/IPv6 addresses and
   associated lease times assigned to hosts via the respective DHCP
   servers.  Relay Agents can thus detect transitions from single to
   dual-stack and vice-versa efficiently.  In addition to this
   technique, which is to be primarily used, transitions can also be
   detected using snooping mechanisms.  Network devices today use
   mechanisms such as ARP and NDP snooping to determine host
   characteristics such as IPv4/IPv6 - MAC bindings.  IPv4/IPv6 and MAC
   counters are also used to determine host liveliness.  These
   mechanisms help determine if a particular IP address family is
   inactive, has reverted to using a single stack even though it
   initially had dual-stack capabilities and detect active dual-stack
   usage after long periods of single-stack activity.

8.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations described in
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-triggered-reconfigure]are applicable to this mechanism.

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign new option codes for OPTION_DNS_RECONFIG
   from the option-code space as defined in section "DHCPv6 Options" of
   [RFC3315].
