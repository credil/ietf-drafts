        OAuth enables a third-party
   application to obtain limited access to a protected resource, either on
   behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction, or by allowing the
   third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.
   </t>
      <t>This document defines how an application client uses credentials obtained via OAuth
        over the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) or the
        Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
        to access a protected resource at a resource serve.  Thereby, it enables
	schemes defined within the OAuth framework for non-HTTP-based application protocols.
      </t> 
      <t>Clients typically store the user's long-term credential. This does, however, lead to 
      significant security vulnerabilities, for example, when such a
      credential leaks. A significant benefit of OAuth for usage in
      those clients is that the password is replaced by a
      token. Tokens typically provided limited access rights and can
      be managed and revoked separately from the user's long-term credential (password).

	<t>OAuth <xref target="RFC6749"/> enables a third-party
	application to obtain limited access to a protected resource, either on
   	behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction, or by allowing the
   	third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf. The core OAuth 2.0
        specification <xref target="RFC6749"/> does not define the interaction between the 
        client and the resource server with the access to a protected resource using an Access Token. 
        This functionality is described in separate specifications, for example bearer tokens <xref
        target="RFC6750"/>, OAuth 2.0 MAC tokens <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-v2-http-mac"/>.
        
        OAuth 1.0a <xref target="RFC5849"/>, the predecessor of OAuth 2.0, has a similar design.  The main use cases for OAuth 2.0 and OAuth 1.0 have so far focused on an HTTP-based environment only.

  <t>This document  takes
        advantage of the OAuth protocol and its deployment base to provide a way to use 
        SASL <xref target="RFC4422"/> as well as the GSS-API <xref target="RFC2743"/> to gain 
	access to resources when using non-HTTP-based protocols, such as the Internet Message 
	Access Protocol (IMAP) <xref target="RFC3501"/> and SMTP <xref target="RFC5321"/>, 
	which is what this memo uses in the examples.</t>

<t>The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) is a framework
   for providing authentication and data security services in
   connection-oriented protocols via replaceable mechanisms.  It
   provides a structured interface between protocols and mechanisms.
   The resulting framework allows new protocols to reuse existing
   mechanisms and allows old protocols to make use of new mechanisms.
   The framework also provides a protocol for securing subsequent
   protocol exchanges within a data security layer.</t>
   
<t>
The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
   <xref target="RFC2743"/> provides a framework for applications to support multiple
   authentication mechanisms through a unified interface. </t>

<t>
 This document
  defines SASL mechanisms for OAuth, and it conforms to the new
   bridge between SASL and the GSS-API called GS2 <xref target="RFC5801"/>.  This means
   that this document defines both SASL and GSS-API
   mechanisms.  Implementers may be interested in 
either the SASL, the GSS-API, or even both mechanisms. To
   facilitate  these two variants, the description has been split into two
   parts, one part that provides normative references for those interested in 
   the SASL OAuth mechanism (see <xref target="SASL-OAUTH"/>), and a second part 
   for those implementers that wish to implement the GSS-API portion (see 
   <xref target="GSSAPI-OAUTH"/>).
</t>

<t>When OAuth is integrated into SASL and the GSS-API the high-level steps are as follows:
<list style="empty"> 
<t>  (A)  The client requests authorization from the resource owner.  The
        authorization request can be made directly to the resource owner
        (as shown), or preferably indirectly via the authorization
        server as an intermediary.</t>
<t>   (B)  The client receives an authorization grant which is a credential
        representing the resource owner's authorization, expressed using
        one of four grant types defined in this specification or using
        an extension grant type.  The authorization grant type depends
        on the method used by the client to request authorization and
        the types supported by the authorization server.</t>
<t>   (C)  The client requests an access token by authenticating with the
        authorization server and presenting the authorization grant.</t>
<t>   (D)  The authorization server authenticates the client and validates
        the authorization grant, and if valid issues an access token.</t>
<t>   (E)  The client requests the protected resource from the resource
        server and authenticates by presenting the access token.</t>
<t>   (F)  The resource server validates the access token, and if valid,
        indicates a successful authentication.</t>
</list> 
</t>

    <t>Steps (E) and (F) are not defined in <xref target="RFC6749"/> and are the
       main functionality specified within this document. 
       Consequently, the message exchange shown in <xref target="overview"/> is the result of this specification.
       The client will generally need to determine the authentication endpoints (and
       perhaps the service endpoints) before the OAuth 2.0 protocol 
       exchange messages in steps (A)-(D) are executed.  The discovery of the resource owner 
       and authorization server endpoints is
       outside the scope of this specification.  The client must discover those
       endpoints using a discovery mechanisms such as Webfinger using host-meta <xref
       target="I-D.ietf-appsawg-webfinger"/>.  In band discovery is not tenable if
       clients support the OAuth 2.0 password grant.  Once credentials are obtained the
       client proceeds to steps (E) and (F) defined in this specification.

    <section anchor="SASL-OAUTH" title="OAuth SASL Mechanism Specifications">

      <t>SASL is used as an authentication framework in a variety of application layer protocols. This
        document defines the following SASL mechanisms for usage with OAuth:

	<list><t>
	<list style="hanging">
	  <t hangText="OAUTHBEARER:">Authorization using OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens as described in <xref target="RFC6750"/>.
	     </t>
	  <t hangText="OAUTH10A:">Authorization using OAuth 1.0a MAC tokens (using the HMAC-SHA1 keyed message digest) as described in Section 3.4.2 of <xref target="RFC5849"/>.
	     </t>
	  <t hangText="OAUTH10A-PLUS:">Adds channel binding <xref target="RFC5056"/> capability 
		to OAUTH10A for protection against man-in-the-middle attacks.
	     </t>
	</list>
	</t></list>

New extensions may be defined to add additional OAuth Access Token Types. Such a new SASL OAuth mechanism can be added by simply registering the new name(s) and citing this
	specification for the further definition.  New channel binding enabled "-PLUS"
	mechanisms defined in this way MUST include message integrity protection.  A 
	newly defined mechanism would also need to register a new GS2 OID.
     </t>

     <t>These mechanisms are client initiated and lock-step, the server always replying to a client 
	message.  In the case where the client has and correctly uses a valid token the flow is:

	<list style="symbols">
	  <t>Client sends a valid and correct initial client response.
	     </t>
	  <t>Server responds with a successful authentication.
	   	  </t>
	</list>

	In the case where authorization fails the server sends an error result, then client MUST
	then send an additional message to the server in order to allow the server to finish the
	exchange.  Some protocols and common SASL implementations do not support both sending a SASL
	message and finalizing a SASL negotiation, the additional client message in the error case
	deals with this problem.  This exchange is:

	<list style="symbols">
		<t>Client sends an invalid initial client response.</t>
		<t>Server responds with an error message. </t>
		<t>Client sends a dummy client response.</t>
		<t>Server fails the authentication.</t>
	</list>

	
	</t>



      <section title="Initial Client Response">
        <t>Client responses are a key/value pair sequence.  The initial client response
	includes a gs2-header as defined in GS2 <xref target="RFC5801"/>, which carries the 
	authorization ID. These key/value pairs carry the equivalent values from 
        an HTTP context in order to be able to complete an OAuth style HTTP authorization.  
	Unknown key/value pairs MUST be ignored by the server. The ABNF <xref target="RFC5234"/> syntax is:

	    <t hangText="qs:">The HTTP query string.  In non-channel binding mechanisms 
		this is reserved, the client SHOUD NOT send it, and has the default value 
		of "".  In "-PLUS" variants this carries

		as an HTTP query string.
		</t>
          </list>
        </t></list>
	</t>
	<t>
	For OAuth Access Token Types that use digital signatures or keyed message digests the client MUST send host and
	port number key/values, and the server MUST fail an authorization request requiring
	signatures or keyed message digests that do not have host and port values.  For authorization schemes 
	that require a URI scheme as part of the data being signed "http" is always used. In 
	OAuth 1.0a for example, the so-called signature base string calculation includes the reconstructed HTTP
	URL.
	</t>

	<section title="Reserved Key/Values">
	  <t> In these mechanisms values for path, query string and post body are 
	  assigned default values.  OAuth authorization schemes MAY define usage of
	  these in the SASL context and extend this specification.  For OAuth Access Token Types that use request signatures the default values MUST be used unless
	  explicit values are provided in the client response.  The following key
	  values are reserved for future use: 

	    <list><t>
		<list style="hanging">
		  <t hangText="mthd (RESERVED):">HTTP method for use in signatures, the default value is "POST".

		  <t hangText="post (RESERVED):">HTTP post data, the default value is "".

		</list>
	    </t></list>
	  </t>
	</section>

	<section title="Use of the gs2-header">
	  <t>The OAuth scheme related mechanisms are also GSS-API mechanisms, see 
		<xref target="GSSAPI-OAUTH" /> for further detail.
   		  The gs2-header is used as follows:

		<list style="symbols">
		  <t>The "gs2-nonstd-flag" MUST NOT be present.
		  </t>
		  <t>The "gs2-authzid" carries the authorization identity as
		     specified in [RFC5801].  If present the application MUST determine 
		     whether access is granted for the identity asserted in the 
		     OAuth credential, if it does not the server
		     MUST fail the negotiation.
		  </t>
		</list>

	    In the non "-PLUS" mechanisms the "gs2-cb-flag" MUST be set to "n" because 
		channel-binding [RFC5056] data is not expected. 
		In the OAUTH10A-PLUS mechanism (or other -PLUS variants based on this specification)
		the "gs2-cb-flag" MUST be set appropriately by the client.

      <section title="Server's Response">
      
      <t>The server validates the response per the specification for the   OAuth Access Token Types used.  If the OAuth Access Token Type utilizes a digital signature or a keyed message digest of the request parameters then the client must provide a client   response that satisfies the data requirements for the scheme in use. 
	</t>

 	<t>In a "-PLUS" mechanism the server examines the channel binding data,
        extracts the channel binding unique prefix, and extracts the raw channel biding
        data based on the channel binding type used.  It then computes it's own copy of
        the channel binding payload and compares that to the payload sent by the client in
        the cbdata key/value.  Those two must be equal for channel binding to succeed.
	</t>

        <t> The server responds to a successfully verified client message by completing the SASL
        negotiation. The authenticated identity reported by the SASL mechanism is the
   	identity securely established for the client with
   	the OAuth credential.  The application, not the SASL mechanism, based on local
	access policy determines whether the identity reported by the mechanism 
	is allowed access to the requested resource.  Note that the semantics of the 
	authz-id is specified by the SASL framework <xref target="RFC4422"/>.

          <section title="OAuth Identifiers in the SASL Context">

  	message is sent in a normal message.  The client MUST then send an

	the server in order to allow the server to finish the exchange.

      <section title="OAuth Access Token Types using Digital Signatures and Keyed Message Digests"><t>OAuth Access Token Types may use digital signatures or keyed message digests. The client and the resource server need to perform a cryptographic computation for integrity protection and data origin authentication.</t>

<t>OAuth is designed for access to resources identified by URIs.  SASL is designed for user authentication, and   has no facility for more fine-grained access control.  In this specification we require or
          define default values for the data elements from an HTTP request which allow the
	  signature base string to be constructed properly.

          The default HTTP path is "/" and the default post body is empty.  These atoms are 
	  defined as extension points so
          that no changes are needed if there is a revision of SASL which supports more
          specific resource authorization, e.g., IMAP access to a specific folder or FTP access
          limited to a specific directory. </t>

        <t> Using the example in the OAuth 1.0a specification 
        as a starting point, on an IMAP server running on port 143 and given
        the OAuth 1.0a style authorization request (with %x01 shown as ^A and line breaks added 
	for readability) below:

	<t>The channel binding data is carried in the "qs" (query string) key value pair
	formatted as a standard HTTP query parameter with the name "cbdata".  Channel 
	binding requires that the channel binding data be integrity protected 
	end-to-end in order to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks. 
	
	
	All SASL OAuth mechanisms with a "-PLUS" postfix   MUST provide integrity protection.  It should be noted   that while the Bearer Access Token Type mandates TLS it does not create keying material at the application layer and is not suitable for use with   channel bindings.</t>

	<t>The channel binding data is computed by the client based on it's choice of
	preferred channel binding type.   As specified in <xref target="RFC5056"/>, the
	channel binding information MUST start with the channel binding unique prefix, followed
	by a colon (ASCII 0x3A), followed by a base64 encoded channel binding
	payload.  The channel binding payload is the raw data from the channel binding
	type.  For example, if the client is using tls-unique for channel binding then 
	the raw channel binding data is the TLS finished message as specified in Section 3.1 of
	<xref target="RFC5929"/>. </t>

<section anchor="GSSAPI-OAUTH" title="GSS-API OAuth Mechanism Specification"> 

<t>Note: The normative references in this section are informational for SASL
   implementers, but they are normative for GSS-API implementers.</t>

<t>A SASL OAuth mechanism is also a GSS-API mechanism and the messages 
   described in <xref target="SASL-OAUTH"/> are the same with the following 
   changes to the GS2 related elements:
   <list style="numbers"> 
   <t>the GS2 header on the client's first message is excluded when used as 
      a GSS-API mechanism.
   </t>
   <t>the initial context token
   header is prefixed to the client's first authentication message
   (context token), as described in Section 3.1 of RFC 2743,
   </t>
   </list> 
   </t>

   <t>The GSS-API mechanism OIDs are:

      <list style="symbols">
	<t>OAUTHBEARER: [[TBD: IANA -- probably in the 1.3.6.1.5.5 tree]]</t>
	<t>OAUTH10A: [[TBD: IANA -- probably in the 1.3.6.1.5.5 tree]]</t>
      </list>
   </t>

   <t>OAuth mechanims security contexts always have the mutual_state flag
   (GSS_C_MUTUAL_FLAG) set to TRUE.  OAuth supports credential
   delegation, therefore security contexts may have the
   deleg_state flag (GSS_C_DELEG_FLAG) set to either TRUE or FALSE.
   </t>

   <t>The mutual authentication property of this mechanism relies on
   successfully comparing the TLS server identity with the negotiated
   target name.  Since the TLS channel is managed by the application
   outside of the GSS-API mechanism, the mechanism itself is unable to
   confirm the name while the application is able to perform this
   comparison for the mechanism.  For this reason, applications MUST
   match the TLS server identity with the target name using the appropriate 
   application profile, as discussed in
   <xref target="RFC6125"/>. For example, when SASL OAuth is run over IMAP 
   then the IMAP profile of RFC 6125 is used.</t>

   <t>OAuth mechanisms do not support per-message tokens or
   GSS_Pseudo_random.</t>

   <t>OAuth supports a standard generic name syntax for acceptors, such as
   GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE (see <xref target="RFC2743"/>, Section 4.1).  
   These service names MUST be associated with the  "entityID" claimed by
   the RP.

   OAuth mechanisms support only a single name type for initiators:
   GSS_C_NT_USER_NAME.  GSS_C_NT_USER_NAME is the default name type.

   The query, display, and exported name syntaxes for OAuth principal
   names are all the same.  There is no OAuth-specific name syntax;
   applications SHOULD use generic GSS-API name types, such as
   GSS_C_NT_USER_NAME and GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE (see <xref target="RFC2743"/>,

   Section 4).  The exported name token does, of course, conform to
   <xref target="RFC2743"/>, Section 3.2, but the "NAME" part of the token should be
   treated as a potential input string to the OAuth name normalization
   rules.

    <section title="Security Considerations">
    
    <t>OAuth 1.0a and OAuth 2 allows for a variety of deployment scenarios, and the security properties of these profiles vary. Application developers therefore need to understand the needs of their applications before selecting a specific SASL OAuth mechanism.</t>   <t>The channel binding in this mechanism has different properties based   on the Access Token Type used.</t>   <t>It is possible that SASL will be authenticating a connection and the   life of that connection may outlast the life of the access token used to   establish it.  This is a common problem in application protocols   where connections are long-lived, and not a problem with this   mechanism per se.  Servers MAY unilaterally disconnect clients in   accordance with the application protocol.</t>   <t>The OAuth access token (and related keying material) is not equivalent to the user’s long term password.  As such, care has to be taken when these OAuth credentials are used for actions   like changing passwords (as it is possible with some protocols, e.g., XMPP).  The server SHOULD ensure that actions taken in   the authenticated channel are appropriate to the strength of the   presented credential.</t>
   
      <t>Access tokens have a lifetime. Reducing the lifetime of an access 
        token provides security benefits, as described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-v2-threatmodel"/>, and OAuth 2.0 introduces refresh tokens to obtain new access token on the fly. Additionally, a previously obtained
        access token MAY be revoked or rendered invalid at any time. The client MAY request a new access token for each
        connection to a resource server, but it SHOULD cache and re-use access credentials that appear
        to be valid.</t>

     <section title="Internationalization Considerations">
	     <t>The identifer asserted by the OAuth authorization server about the resource owner inside the access token may be displayed to a human. For example, when SASL is used in the context of IMAP the resource server may assert the resource owner's email address to the IMAP server for usage in an email-based application. The identifier may therefore contain internationalized characters and an application needs to ensure that the mapping between the identifier provided by OAuth is suitable for use with the application layer protocol SASL is incorporated into.</t>
	     
	     <t>At the time of writing the standardization of the assertion format (in JSON format) is still ongoing, see <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-json-web-token"/>.</t>
