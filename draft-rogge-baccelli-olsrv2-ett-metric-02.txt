Internet-Draft         Directional ETT for OLSRv2              July 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Funkfeuer [FUNKFEUER] and Freifunk networks [FREIFUNK] are OLSR-
   based [RFC3626] wireless community networks with hundreds of routers
   in permanent operation.  The Vienna Funkfeuer network in Austria, for
   instance, consists of 400 routers (around 600 routes) covering the
   whole city of Vienna and beyond, spanning roughly 40km in diameter.
   It has been in operation since 2003 and supplies its users with
   Internet access.  A particularity of the Vienna Funkfeuer network is
   that it manages to provide Internet access through a city wide, large
   scale Wi-Fi mesh cloud, with just a single Internet uplink.

   Operational experience with these networks have revealed that the use
   of hop-count as routing metric leads to unsatisfactory network
   performance.  Experiments with the ETX metric [MOBICOM03] were
   therefore undertaken in parallel in the Berlin Freifunk network as
   well as in the Vienna Funkfeuer network, and found satisfactory,
   i.e., sufficiently easy to implement and providing sufficiently good
   performance.  This metric has now been in operational use in these
   networks for many years.

   The ETX metric of a link is the estimated number of transmissions
   required to successfully send a packet (each packet equal to or
   smaller than MTU) over that link, until a link-layer acknowledgement
   is received.  The ETX metric is additive, i.e., the ETX metric of a
   path is the sum of the ETX metrics for each link on this path.

   While the ETX metric delivers a reasonable performance, it doesn't
   handle networks with heterogeneous links that have different bitrates
   well.  Since every wireless link, when using ETX metric, is
   characterized only by its packet loss ratio, the ETX metric prefers
   long-ranged links with low bitrate (with low loss ratios) over short-
   ranged links with high bitrate (with higher but reasonable loss
   ratios).  Such conditions, when they occur, can degrade the
   performance of a network considerably by not taking advantage of
   higher capacity links.

   Based on the ETX metric this document describes an Estimated Travel
   Time (ETT) metric [MOBICOM04] for the Optimized Link State Routing
   Protocol Version 2.  This ETT metric also takes the bitrate into
   account.  More precisely, this document specifies the processing for
   NHDP [RFC6130] in order to establish the ETT metric value for a link.


2.  Terminology

   The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL
   NOT','SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'NOT RECOMMENDED', 'MAY',

   and 'OPTIONAL' in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   The terminology introduced in [RFC5444], [OLSRV2] and [RFC6130],
   including the terms "packet", "message" and "TLV" are to be
   interpreted as described therein.

   Additionally, this document uses the following terminology and
   notational conventions:

   QUEUE  - a first in, first out queue of integers.

   QUEUE[TAIL]  - the most recent element in the queue.

   add(QUEUE, value)  - adds a new element to the TAIL of the queue.

   remove(QUEUE)  - removes the HEAD element of the queue

   sum(QUEUE)  - an operation which returns the sum of all elements in a
      QUEUE.

   diff_seqno(new, old)  - an operation which returns the positive
      distance between two elements of the circular sequence number
      space defined in section 5.1 of [RFC5444].  Its value is either
      (new - old) if this result is positive, or else its value is (new
      - old + 65536).

   MAX(a,b)  - the maximum of a and b.

   UNDEFINED  - a constant for -1.

   airtime  - the time a transmitted packet blocks a shared medium,
      e.g., a wireless link.

   ETX  - Expected Transmission Count, a link metric proportional to the
      number of transmissions to sucessfully send an IP packet over a
      link.

   ETT  - Estimated Travel Time, a link metric proportional to the
      amount of airtime needed to transmit an IP packet over a link, not
      considering layer-2 overhead created by preamble, backoff time and
      queuing.


3.  Applicability Statement

   The mechanism specified in this document is based on the ETX metric
   used daily by hundreds of routers in the Funkfeuer network



Rogge & Baccelli         Expires January 9, 2014                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         Directional ETT for OLSRv2              July 2013


   [FUNKFEUER], as well as in similar OLSR-based wireless community
   networks which use the OLSR.org [OLSR.org] code base, such as
   [FREIFUNK], [AWMN], [NINUX], [GUIFI] and [OPENAIR].  Operational
   experience suggests that this mechanism is viable in (at least) these
   kinds of networks.

   The ETT metric, used in the OLSR.org implementation of [OLSRV2], is a
   refinement of the ETX metric that was used in the earlier [RFC3626]
   implementation.  It provides a directional metric that takes packet
   loss and bitrate of the link into account to compute the link cost.

   The ETX metric value of a link is established by measuring the rate
   of successful exchange of OLSRv2 control packets over that link,
   which uses the format defined in [RFC5444].  ETX metric computation
   is thus based only on layer 3 signaling, and is therefore independent
   from underlying link layer technologies.  Moreover, ETX metric
   computation does not require inspection of data traffic.

   The bitrate of the incoming link traffic MUST be known by a router,
   performing the ETT calculation defined in this specification; either
   through direct measurement or indirectly delivered by an external
   source as operation system API, external processes or a configuration
   file.

   Both ETX and ETT metric have been designed for networks with link-
   layer acknowledgement and retransmission mechanisms for user traffic.


4.  Directional Packet-Size Agnostic ETT

   The metric specified in this document is based on the Estimated
   Travel Time (ETT) metric published in [MOBICOM04].

   [MOBICOM04] describes the metric as 'ETX divided by bitrate', but
   also introduce a 'packet size' variable in the formula
   representation, describing the metric as 'ETX times packet-size
   divided by bitrate'.

   This document specifies the use of a variant of the ETT metric
   without any packet-size integrated into the link costs.  There are
   multiple reasons for this design choice:

   o  The original ETT metric was designed for a DSR derived source-
      routed protocol.  Typical link-state protocols like OSLRv2 do not
      process each data-plane packet on its own, which makes it
      difficult to integrate the size of the data-plane packets into the
      routing metric.

Internet-Draft         Directional ETT for OLSRv2              July 2013


   o  The original ETT metric assumes that the airtime spent on a link
      is proportional to the size of the packet transmitted over the
      link.

   o  Multiplying all topology edge costs 'ETX divided by bitrate' with
      the size of a packet would not change the result of the shortest
      path calculation, independently of the packet size.  This means
      both description of ETT should result in the same next-hop
      decision.

   In addition to this, the metric described in this document is
   directional, it does calculate the ETX value only based on the packet
   loss at the receiver.


5.  Metric Functioning & Overview

   Router A computes the ETX value of a link between an interface of
   router A and an interface of router B by continuously estimating the
   loss rates for incoming traffic over this link.

   To measure the loss rate of a link, this metric stores the packet
   sequence number of the last incoming [RFC5444] packet of this link.
   If one or more consecutive numbers are missing between a received
   packet and the last one, the metric considers this packets to be
   lost.

   The incoming link bitrate is defined external to this specification,
   either by measurement or through an administrative process.  The
   bitrate should reflect the datarate of the unicast traffic traveling
   over this link.

   The ETT metric is calculated as the ETX metric, divided by the
   normalized bitrate of the incoming traffic from the neighbor.  This
   value is then used as L_in_metric of the Link Set (as defined in
   section 8.1. of [OLSRV2]).


6.  Protocol Parameters

   This specification defines the following parameters:

   ETT_MEMORY_LENGTH  - ETT algorithm queue length.  All received and
      lost packets within the queue are used to calculate the ETT cost
      of the link.

Internet-Draft         Directional ETT for OLSRv2              July 2013


   ETT_REFRESH_INTERVAL  - interval in seconds between two metric
      recalculations as described in Section 11.

   ETT_SEQNO_RESTART_DETECTION  - threshold in number of missing packets
      (based on received packet sequence numbers) at which point the
      router considers the neighbor has restarted.

   ETT_HELLO_TIMEOUT_FACTOR  - timeout factor for HELLO interval at
      which point a HELLO is definitely considered lost.  The value must
      be a floating point number larger than 1.0.

   ETT_WORST_ETX  - Maximum ETX value used in this routing metric.

   ETT_BEST_BITRATE  - Maximum bitrate in bits/s of used in routing
      metric.

   ETT_WORST_BITRATE  - Minimum bitrate in bits/s used in this metric.

   ETT_WORST_NO_LOSS_METRIC_VALUE  - metric value for ETX 1.0 and
      ETT_WORST_BITRATE bitrate.


7.  Data Structures

   This specification extends the Link Set Tuples of the Interface
   Information Base, as defined in [RFC6130] section 7.1, with the
   following additional elements for each link tuple:

   L_ETT_received  is a QUEUE with ETT_MEMORY_LENGTH integer elements.
      Each entry contains the number of successfully received [RFC5444]
      packets within an interval of ETT_REFRESH_INTERVAL.

   L_ETT_total  is a QUEUE with ETT_MEMORY_LENGTH integer elements.
      Each entry contains the estimated number of [RFC5444] packets
      transmitted by the neighbor, based on the received packet sequence
      numbers within an interval of ETT_REFRESH_INTERVAL.

   L_ETT_last_pkt_seqno  is the last received packet sequence number
      received from this link.

   L_ETT_hello_time  is the time when the next hello will be expected.

   L_ETT_hello_interval  is the interval between two hello messages of
      the links neighbor as signaled by the INTERVAL_TIME TLV [RFC5497]
      of NHDP messages [RFC6130].

Internet-Draft         Directional ETT for OLSRv2              July 2013


   L_ETT_lost_hello_messages  is the estimated number of lost hello
      messages from this neighbor, based on the value of the hello
      interval.

   L_ETT_rx_bitrate  is the current bitrate of incoming unicast traffic
      for this neighbor.

   Methods to obtain the value of L_ETT_rx_bitrate are out of scope for
   this specification.  Such methods may be static configuration via a
   configuration file, or dynamic measurement through mechanisms
   described in a separate specification.  Any Link tuple with L_status
   = HEARD or L_status = SYMMETRIC MUST have a specified value of
   L_ETT_rx_bitrate if it is to be used by this routing metric.


8.  Initial Values

   When generating a new tuple in the Link Set, as defined in [RFC6130]
   section 12.5 bullet 3, the values of the elements specified in
   Section 7 are set as follows:

   o  L_ETT_received := 0, ..., 0.  The queue always have
      ETT_MEMORY_LENGTH elements.

   o  L_ETT_total := 0, ..., 0.  The queue always have ETT_MEMORY_LENGTH
      elements.

   o  L_ETT_last_pkt_seqno := UNDEFINED.

   o  L_ETT_hello_time := EXPIRED.

   o  L_ETT_hello_interval := UNDEFINED.

   o  L_ETT_lost_hello_messages := 0


9.  Packets and Messages

   Generated packets and messages use the format defined in [RFC5444].
   This ETT metric does neither create RFC5444 messages on its own, nor
   does it define new TLV types for existing message types.

   An implementation of OLSRv2, using the metric specified by this
   document, MUST include the following parts into its [RFC5444] output:

   o  an interface specific packet sequence number as defined in
      [RFC5444] section 5.1 which is incremented by 1 for each outgoing
      [RFC5444] packet on the interface.

Internet-Draft         Directional ETT for OLSRv2              July 2013


   o  an INTERVAL_TIME message TLV in each Hello message, as defined in
      [RFC6130] section 4.3.2.

9.1.  Definitions

   For the purpose of this section, note the following definitions:

   o  "pkt_seqno" is defined as the [RFC5444] packet sequence number of
      the received packet.

   o  "interval_time" is the time encoded in the INTERVAL_TIME message
      TLV of a received [RFC6130] HELLO message.

9.2.  Packet Processing

   For each incoming [RFC5444] packet, additional processing MUST be
   carried out after the packets messages have been processed as
   specified in [RFC6130] and [OLSRV2].

   [RFC5444] packets without packet sequence number MUST NOT be
   processed by this metric.

   The router MUST update the Link Set Tuple corresponding to the
   originator of the packet:

   1.  If L_ETT_last_pkt_seqno = UNDEFINED, then:

       1.  L_ETT_received[TAIL] := 1.

       2.  L_ETT_total[TAIL] := 1.

   2.  Otherwise:

       1.  L_ETT_received[TAIL] := L_ETT_received[TAIL] + 1.

       2.  diff := seq_diff(pkt_seqno, L_ETT_last_pkt_seqno).

       3.  If diff > ETT_SEQNO_RESTART_DETECTION, then:

           1.  diff := 1.

       4.  L_ETT_total[TAIL] := L_ETT_total[TAIL] + diff.

   3.  L_ETT_last_pkt_seqno := pkt_seqno.

   4.  If L_ETT_hello_interval != UNDEFINED, then:

Internet-Draft         Directional ETT for OLSRv2              July 2013


       1.  L_ETT_hello_time := current time + (L_ETT_hello_interval *
           ETT_HELLO_TIMEOUT_FACTOR).

   5.  L_ETT_lost_hello_messages := 0.

9.3.  HELLO Message Processing

   For each incoming HELLO Message, after it has been processed as
   defined in [RFC6130] section 12, the Link Set Tuple corresponding to
   the incoming HELLO message must be updated.

   Only HELLO Messages with an INTERVAL_TIME message TLVs must be
   processed.

   1.  L_ETT_hello_interval := interval_time.


10.  HELLO Timeout

   When L_ETT_hello_time has timed out, the following step MUST be done:

   1.  L_ETT_lost_hello_messages := L_ETT_lost_hello_messages + 1.

   2.  L_ETT_hello_time := L_ETT_hello_time + L_ETT_hello_interval.


11.  Periodic Metric Update

   This metric stores the number of received packets per link from a
   neighbor and use the packet sequence number to calculate the total
   number of sent packets from the neighbor.  The total number of
   packets divided by the number of received packets is used as an ETX
   value for the link.

   If connectivity of link with a node is lost, no packets are received
   anymore and neither the received nor total value of packets will
   change.  To prevent a constant result in this case, the metric stores
   the number of HELLO message interval timeouts since the last received
   packet from a neighbor and uses this value to reduce the received
   packet count proportionally to the length of the metric memory
   ETT_MEMORY_LENGTH.

   Once every ETT_REFRESH_INTERVAL, this protocol MUST recalculate all
   L_in_metric values in all Link Set entries:

   1.  sum_received := sum(L_ETT_total).

   2.  sum_total := sum(L_ETT_received).

   3.  If L_ETT_hello_interval != UNDEFINED and L_ETT_lost_hellos > 0,
       then:

       1.  penalty := L_ETT_hello_interval * L_ETT_lost_hellos /
           ETT_MEMORY_LENGTH.

       2.  sum_received := sum_received * MAX ( 0, 1 - penalty );

   4.  If sum_received < 1, then:

       1.  L_ETT_r_etx := UNDEFINED.

       2.  L_in_metric := MAXIMUM_METRIC, as defined in [OLSRV2] section
           5.6.1.

   5.  Otherwise:

       1.  etx := sum_total / sum_received.

       2.  If etx > ETT_WORST_ETX, then:

           1.  etx := ETT_WORST_ETX.

       3.  bitrate := L_ETT_rx_bitrate.

       4.  If bitrate > ETT_BEST_BITRATE, then:

           1.  bitrate := ETT_BEST_BITRATE.

       5.  If bitrate < ETT_WORST_BITRATE, then:

           1.  bitrate := ETT_WORST_BITRATE.

       6.  L_in_metric := ETT_WORST_NO_LOSS_METRIC_VALUE * etx /
           (bitrate / ETT_WORST_BITRATE).

   6.  remove(L_ETT_total)

   7.  add(L_ETT_total, 0)

   8.  remove(L_ETT_received)

   9.  add(L_ETT_received, 0)

12.  Proposed Values for Parameters and Constants

   This section proposes values for various parameters used in this
   specification.

   o  ETT_MEMORY_LENGTH := 64

   o  ETT_REFRESH_INTERVAL := 1 second

   o  ETT_SEQNO_RESTART_DETECTION := 256

   o  ETT_HELLO_TIMEOUT_FACTOR := 1.5

   o  ETT_WORST_ETX := 16

   o  ETT_BEST_BITRATE := 256 MBit/s

   o  ETT_WORST_BITRATE := 1 MBit/s

   o  ETT_WORST_NO_LOSS_METRIC_VALUE := 4096

   With this values this ETT metric will go from 16 (256+ MBit/s, ETX
   1.0) over 4096 (1 MBit/s, ETX 1.0) to a maximum of 65536 (1 MBit/s,
   ETX 16.0).

   The settings were chosen based on the deployment of the original ETX
   metric in the Funkfeuer community mesh network.  They allow the
   existence of both priority links (links faster than any ETT link) and
   backup links (links slower than any ETT link) and should deliver a
   reasonable performance for non-moving mesh networks.

   For mobile mesh deployments the administrator should decrease both
   the memory length and refresh interval to allow a faster metric

14.  Security Considerations

   Artificial manipulation of metrics values can drastically alter
   network performance.  In particular, advertising a higher L_in_metric
   value may decrease the amount of incoming traffic, while advertising
   lower L_in_metric may increase the amount of incoming traffic.  By
   artificially increasing or decreasing the L_in_metric values it

   advertises, a rogue router may thus attract or repulse data traffic.
   A rogue router may then potentially degrade data throughput by not
   forwarding data as it should or redirecting traffic into routing
   loops or bad links.

   An attacker might also inject packets with incorrect packet-level
   sequence numbers, pretending to be somebody else.  This attack could
   be prevented by the true originator of the RFC5444 packets by adding
   a [RFC6622] ICV Packet TLV and TIMESTAMP Packet TLV to each packet.
   This allows the receiver to drop all incoming packets which have a
   forged packet source, both packets generated by the attacker or
   replayed earlier packets by the original sender.
