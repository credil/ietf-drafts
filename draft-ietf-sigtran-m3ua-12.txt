This memo defines a protocol for supporting the transport of
any SS7 MTP3-User signalling (e.g., ISUP and SCCP messages) over IP
using the services of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol.  Also,
provision is made for protocol elements that enable a seamless
operation of the MTP3-User peers in the SS7 and IP domains. This
protocol would be used between a Signalling Gateway (SG) and a Media
Gateway Controller (MGC) or  IP-resident Database, or between two
IP-based applications.  It is assumed that the SG receives SS7
signalling over a standard SS7 interface using the SS7 Message
Transfer Part (MTP) to provide transport.

This document is a product of the Signaling Transport Working Group of
the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
