Abstract

   The MANET Working Group is developing management interfaces, i.e.,
   Management Information Base (MIB) modules, for its control protocols,
   e.g., Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP), Simplified Multicast
   Forwarding (SMF), etc.  The NETMOD Working group is developing a set
   of standard YANG modules for the basic configuration management of
   standard IP capable devices. Future IP capable radio networks will
   rely upon these and other modules for their management. The
   convergence of these activities requires the development of a
   conceptual radio management model to help promote a consistent set of
   modules for the configuration, monitoring and notification management
   of typical wireless radio devices.  This document provides such a
   framework.

1  Introduction

   Current wireless radio devices employed for military, emergency
   services or other networking domains are rather complex devices.
   These devices range from simple MAC level and below networking
   devices, which provide interfaces to IP routers, to extremely complex
   networking devices consisting of applications running on hosts which
   are logically connected to embedded routers with multiple (sometimes
   hierarchical) wireless interfaces.  Currently, the proprietary
   management interfaces to these devices are monolithic, ill-logically
   organized and providing an inconsistent set of objects and services.
   This document intends to promote a standard radio management model to
   help in the development of standard models (i.e., YANG and MIB
   modules) for management of a broad set of radio devices.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2 Objective

   Breaking down the structure of the radio into functional layers
   allows radio systems to define management modules that are logically
   compartmentalized, straightforward and practical in size. In this
   manner, we also allow for modules that are agile enough to let radios
   of varied levels of complexity to tailor precisely which modules are
   needed for their management based upon their capability set.
   Conforming to this model would also provide for configuration
   consistency across platforms. This in turn would simplify other
   aspects of configuration management including compatibility,
   training, isolation, troubleshooting, procurement, and technology
   evolution. Furthermore, we can avoid redundancy by leveraging
   existing modules that fulfill the functionality represented by the
   layer.

3  Radio Management Model

   This section defines the radio management model.

   We define three radio management models to represent the functional
   layers of a radio as it relates to the function performed and
   protocols used. The first of these models shows a standard top down
   layering of functionality with network interfaces communicating on a
   1-to-1 basis. This would depict a radio functioning as a router with
   a single interface out of a single antenna. The other models

   represent a 1-to-many and a many-to-1 router interface to antenna
   configurations as identified in following subsections.

3.1  Non-multiplexed Management Model

   At the top level of the model is the application layer. Multiple
   running applications are supported with a standard being defined that
   can be extended to include parameters specific to the individual
   application.  These applications map to the hosts on the next layer
   down. Again, multiple hosts running on a radio are supported in this
   model.

   The routing and MAC layers includes all parameters necessary for
   network routing and wireless medium access (e.g. address tables, MAC
   addresses). The Frequency Mgmt layer handles basic frequency band
   definitions (e.g. power level). In this model, no virtual interfaces
   are represented, i.e. the router interface maps to a single device
   (MAC and Physical antenna) interface, e.g. gr0. 

   Running alongside these layers and interacting with each is an
   associated management module.  Management modules will exist within
   actual radio implementations and provide configuration, state,
   performance and notification management of all aspects of the radio
   implementation.

   Several of the layers within the conceptual radio model presented
   here have already been codified into management modules through SMIv2
   [RFC2578] or YANG [RFC6020]. For example, within SMI numerous modules

   covering a significant number of functional areas have already been
   standardized. Some of these include (but are not limited to): 

       - Application - SYSAPPL-MIB [RFC2287]
       - Host - HOST-RESOURCES-MIB [RFC2790]
       - Standard MIB-II - [RFC1213] (which includes tcpTable (updated 
         in [RFC4022]), udpTable (updated in [RFC4113]), ipForwarding 
         (updated in [RFC4293]), ifTable, atTable, etc, providing 
         management interfaces to broad networking functionality of all
         IP-capable devices.) 
       - Various control protocol MIBs, e.g. OSPF-MIB [RFC4750], 
         NHDP-MIB [I-D.ietf-manet-nhdp-mib], SMF-MIB 
         [I-D.ietf-manet-smf-mib], etc. 

   The netmod community has several drafts submitted which would
   establish YANG counterparts to these modules. These include Routing
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-routing-cfg], System Management [I-D.ietf-netmod-
   system-mgmt], and Interface Configuration [I-D.ietf-netmod-
   interfaces-cfg].

                   Figure 2. Downward multiplexed MAC (DSA)

   In the "Downward Multiplexed Radio Management" model, the router sees
   one or multiple interfaces, e.g. dsa0, dsa1, etc. Each interface is a
   collection of real interfaces, one for each antenna system. This is
   representative of, for example, a Dynamic Spectrum Access

   implementation. Here the router interface is managed by a high level
   MAC protocol (e.g. the DSA MAC) which manages data receipt and
   transmission over multiple real interfaces operating on different
   frequencies with separate instances of MACs (e.g. MAC 1 to MAC-j).

   These types of downward multiplexed interfaces can be defined within
   the context of the ifInterfaceTable of the IF-MIB [RFC2863] and the
   draft interface YANG module. [I-D.ietf-netmod-interfaces-cfg]

   The IF-MIB defines an interface to the router and how the interface
   to the router relates to the interfaces on the network. These
   relationships are expressed using a stack table with pointers to map
   to interfaces. The ifStackTable can also be used to represent the
   relationship of multiple interfaces to a single interface. Using this
   data structure, we can express the architectures of the downward and
   upward multiplexing radio models. The draft interface YANG module
   seeks to define the framework of a corresponding data structure for
   this mapping in YANG. 


3.3  Upward Multiplexed Radio Management Model

   In the "Upward Multiplexed Radio Management" model, the router sees
   one or more physical interfaces, e.g. eth0, eth1, etc. Multiplexed on
   the physical interfaces are a set of virtual interfaces, (for
   example, of type PPPoE, e.g. vir0.0, vir0.1, ...) This is

4  Next Steps

   There is a need for the development of standardized MAC layer modules
   for wireless networks along with their management modules. The
   modules for managing these protocols for the most part do not exist,

   with 802.11 being the exception [IEEE802dot11-MIB]. The structure of
   our standard model would represent a device using this standard.
   Another effort would be the development of a standard frequency
   interface to manage the frequency across multiple MACs.

   By writing this document, we are looking to develop commonality of a
   management model within the radio vendor community. This commonality
   will improve systems interoperability, improve management, and reduce
   the training and support cost incurred by the consumer communities
   for these IP networking devices.

   This document specifies a framework for standardizing the development
   of radio management models.  It does not raise or consider any
   protocol-specific security issues.
