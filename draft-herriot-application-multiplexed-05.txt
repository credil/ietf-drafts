The Application/Vnd.pwg-multiplexed content-type, like the
Multipart/Related content-type, provides a mechanism for representing
objects that consist of multiple components.  An
Application/Vnd.pwg-multiplexed entity contains a sequence of chunks.
Each chunk contains a MIME message or a part of a MIME message.  Each
MIME message represents a component of the compound object, just as a
body part of a Multipart/Related entity represents a component.  With
a Multipart/Related entity, a body part and its reference in some
other body part may be separated by many octets.  With an
Application/Vnd.pwg-multiplexed entity, a message and its reference in
some other message can be made quite close by chunking the message
containing the reference.  For example, if a long message contains
references to images and the producer does not know of the need for
each image until it generates the reference, then
Application/Vnd.pwg-multiplexed allows the consumer to process the
reference to the image and the image before it consumes the entire
long message.  This ability is important in printing and scanning
applications.  This document defines the
Application/Vnd.pwg-multiplexed content-type. It also provides
examples of its use.
