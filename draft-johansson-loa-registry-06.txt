Internet-Draft                LoA Registry                      May 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document establishes an IANA registry for Level of Assurance
   Profiles.

   Quoting from sstc.saml-assurance-profile
   [OASIS.sstc.saml-assurance-profile] we find the following definition
   of the concept of 'level of assurance':

   _Many existing (and potential) SAML federation deployments have
   adopted a "levels of assurance" (or LOA) model for categorizing the
   wide variety of authentication methods into a small number of levels,
   typically based on some notion of the strength of the authentication.
   Federation members (service providers or "relying parties") then
   decide which level of assurance is required to access specific
   protected resources, based on some assessment of "value" or "risk"._

   Another definition of a 'level of assurance' is given in RFC4949
   [RFC4949] which also identifies the roots of such profiles in the
   NIST special publication series, in particular SP 800-63 [SP63].
   Level of Assurance profiles are used in various protocols, including
   the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) version 2.0 and OpenID
   Connect.

   Several so called trust frameworks and identity federations now
   exist, some of which define one or more Level of Assurance (LoA).
   The purpose of this specification is to create an IANA registry where
   such LoA definitions can be discovered.  While the quote above
   references SAML the notion of a "level of assurance" has gained wide-
   spread acceptance and should be treated as a protocol-independent
   concept.  The proposed IANA registry attempts to reflects this.

   Although the registry will contain URIs that reference SAML
   Authentication Context Profiles other protocols may use such URIs to
   identify levels of assurance definitions without relying on or
   transmitting their SAML XML definitions.  Use of the registry by
   protocols other than SAML is encouraged.

   For instance OpenID Connect defines the standard claim 'acr' as a
   identifier that may reference a SAML Authentication Context Class
   even though OpenID Connect is not itself based on XML or SAML.

   Protocol designers who want to reference the registry should be aware
   that registered LoAs may depend on assumptions that do not carry over
   to all protocols and that such assumptions may vary among the
   protocols for which the LoAs were originally registered.

Internet-Draft                LoA Registry                      May 2012


2.  Name of Registry

   The name of the registry shall be "Level of Assurance Profile", in
   plural "Level of Assurance Profiles".  The term LoA is an
   abbreviation of Level of Assurance.


3.  Registration Template

   The following information must be provided with each registration:

   URI:  A URI referencing a Level of Assurance Profile.  This is the
      registry key.

   Context Class:  A valid XML schema definition for the SAML 2.0 LoA
      Context Class fulfilling the requirements of sstc.saml-assurance-
      profile [OASIS.sstc.saml-assurance-profile].  The registry key
      (the URI) is the unique identifier for the Context Class.

   Name:  A string uniquely and unambiguously identifying the LoA for
      use in protocols where URIs are not appropriate.

   Informational URL:  A URL containing auxilliary information.  This
      URL must minimally reference contact information for the
      administrative authority of the level of assurance definition and
      must use either the http or https schemes.

   Note that it is possible for a single SAML Authentication Context
   Class to contain definitions of multiple URIs.  In that case a
   separate registration is to be used for each URI.  Both the name and
   the URI are to uniquely and unambigously identify the LoA.  The name
   is meant to be used in protocols where URIs are not appropriate.  In
   addition the requester is expected to provide basic contact
   information and the name of the organization on behalf of which the
   LoA definition is registered.

   The Name is defined by the following ABNF (as defined in RFC5234
   [RFC5234]):
   label = ( ALPHA / DIGIT )
   name = label 1*( label / "-" / "." / "_" )

Internet-Draft                LoA Registry                      May 2012


   The elements defined by the following ABNF productions represent a
   set of reserved values for the Name element and are not to be
   registered:
   reserved = loa / al / num
   loa = ( "l" / "L" ) ( "o" / "O" ) ( "a" / "A") *DIGIT
   al = ( "a" / "A") ( "l" / "L") *DIGIT
   num = *DIGIT
   The reason for excluding these productions is a desire to avoid a
   race to register overly generic LoA profiles under names like "AL1"
   or "LOA2".

3.1.  Example Registration

   1.  Name of requester: J. Random User

   2.  E-mail address of requester: jrandom@example.com

   3.  Organization of requester: Example Trust Frameworks LLP

   4.  Requested registration:

   URI  http://foo.example.com/assurance/loa-1

   Name  foo-loa-1

   Information URL  https://foo.example.com/assurance/

3.2.  Note on the Example

   The example is borrowed (slightly modified) from sstc.saml-assurance-
   profile [OASIS.sstc.saml-assurance-profile].  The example should not
   be registered.


4.  Registration Policy

   The registry is to be operated under the "Expert Review" policy from
   RFC5226 [RFC5226] employing a pool of experts.  IANA is kindly asked
   to do rough randomized load-balancing among the experts and also do
   an initial review of each submission to ensure that the name is and
   URI are unique within the registry.  The review criteria are outlined
   below.

   Registrations that reference multiple LoAs in a consistent set of

Internet-Draft                LoA Registry                      May 2012


   policies - for instance when a trust framework defines multiple
   levels of assurance - the registered LoA Name and URIs should be
   consistently named so that they identified as belonging to the same
   set of registrations.  For instance fruitLoA1,fruitLoA2 and fruitLoA3
   is preferred over apple,pear and banana when these Names refer to a
   single set of policies defining 3 LoAs.

4.1.  Reviewer Expectations

   The expectation of the IANA LoA Registry is that it contain
   registrations of bona fide Level of Assurance Profiles while not
   presenting a very high bar for entry.

   Expert reviewers are expected to verify that:

   o  the registration is consistent and that the provided XML fulfills
      the requirements of sstc.saml-assurance-profile
      [OASIS.sstc.saml-assurance-profile].

   o  the Name element is clearly associated with the registered LoA
      Profile and is not a reserved value.

   o  the URI and Name elements are not already registered.

   o  the Information URL can be expected to be stable and permanent.

   Note that multiple registrations may share a common Informational
   URL.

   The reviewers should exclude registrations where the Name does not
   unambiguously identify the LoA definition or where the Name is a
   simple variation on one of the reserved names.

   Expert reviewers are expected to allow registrations made in good
   faith that fulfil these requirements.


5.  Registry Semantics

   The intended use for this registry is to serve as a basis for
   discovery of LoA definitions that might for instance be used by
   protocol-specific (eg SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect) management tools.

   Note that consumers of the registry, being implementations of
   [OASIS.sstc.saml-ass], are expected to allow configuration of LoA
   URIs at system deploy-time.  If multiple sources of LOA URIs are
   permitted in addition to the registry (eg manual input) then it is
   important to avoid collisions with URIs found in the registry.

Internet-Draft                LoA Registry                      May 2012


   The presence of an entry in the registry does not imply any semantic
   or quality beyond that which results from the review done by the
   expert reviewer as part of the registration process.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document sets up a registry with IANA making the whole document
   a set of considerations for IANA.


7.  Security Considerations

   The registry is not a federation or trust framework.  Consumers of
   the registry are strongly advised to review the information about an
   LoA before relying on it.


8.  Acknowledgements

   RL 'Bob' Morgan, Scott Cantor, Lucy Lynch and John Bradley were
   involved in the initial discussions around this idea and contributed
   to the semantics of the registry.  The various versions of the draft
   were socialized in the Kantara Federation Interoperability WG and in
   other parts of the identity community.
