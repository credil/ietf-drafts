     Abstract 

     There are many scenarios in which Traffic Engineering (TE) metrics 
     such as cost, latency and latency variation associated with a 
     Forwarding Adjacency (FA) or Routing Adjacency (RA) Label Switched 
     Path (LSP) are not available to the ingress and egress nodes. This 
     draft provides extensions for the Resource ReserVation Protocol-
     Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for the support of the discovery of 
     cost, latency and latency variation of an LSP.

     1. Introduction 

        There are many scenarios in packet and optical networks where 
        the route information of an LSP may not be provided to the 
        ingress node for confidentiality reasons and/or the ingress node 
        may not run the same routing instance as the intermediate nodes 
        traversed by the path. In such scenarios, the ingress node 
        cannot determine the cost, latency and latency variation 
        properties of the LSP's route. Similarly, in Generalized Multi-
        Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks signaling 
        bidirectional LSP, the egress node cannot determine the cost, 
        latency and latency variation properties of the LSP route.  A 
        multi-domain or multi-layer network is an example of such 
        networks. Similarly, a GMPLS User-Network Interface (UNI) 
        [RFC4208] is also an example of such networks.  

        In certain networks, such as financial information networks, 
        network performance information (e.g. latency, latency 
        variation) is becoming as critical to data path selection as 
        other metrics [DRAFT-OSPF-TE-METRIC], [DRAFT-ISIS-TE-METRIC]. If 
        cost, latency or latency variation associated with an FA or an 
        RA LSP is not available to the ingress or egress node, it cannot 
        be advertised as an attribute of the FA or RA. One possible way 
        to address this issue is to configure cost, latency and latency 
        variation values manually. However, in the event of an LSP being 
        rerouted (e.g. due to re-optimization), such configuration 
        information may become invalid. Consequently, in case where that 
        an LSP is advertised as a TE-Link, the ingress and/or egress 
        nodes cannot provide the correct latency, latency variation and 
        cost attribute associated with the TE-Link automatically.  

        In summary, there is a requirement for the ingress and egress 
        nodes to learn the cost, latency and latency variation 
        attributes of an FA or RA LSP. This draft provides extensions to 
        the Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) 
        for the support of the automatic discovery of these attributes.   

     2. RSVP-TE Requirement  

        This section outlines RSVP-TE requirements for the support of 
        the automatic discovery of cost, latency and latency variation 
        attributes of an LSP. These requirements are very similar to the 
        requirement of discovering the Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs) 
        associated with the route taken by an LSP [DRAFT-SRLG-
        RECORDING].

     2.1. Cost, Latency and Latency Variation Collection Indication 

           The ingress node of the LSP must be capable of indicating 
        whether the cost, latency and latency variation attributes of 
        the LSP should be collected during the signaling procedure of 
        setting up the LSP. No cost, latency or latency variation 
        information is collected without an explicit request being made 
        by the ingress node. 

     2.2. Cost, Latency and Latency Variation Collection 

           If requested, cost, latency and latency variation is 
        collected during the setup of an LSP. The endpoints of the LSP 
        may use the collected information for routing, flooding and TE 
        link configuration and other purposes. 

     2.3. Cost, Latency and Latency Variation Update 

           When the cost, latency and latency variation property of a TE 
        link along the route of a LSP for which that property was 
        collected changes, e.g., if the administrator changes cost of a 
        TE link, the node where the change occurred needs to be capable 
        of updating the cost, latency and latency variation information 
        of the path and signaling this to the end-points. Similarly, if 
        a path segment of the LSP is rerouted, the endpoints of the re-
        routed segment need to be capable of updating the cost, latency 
        and latency variation information of the path. Any node, which 
        adds cost, latency or latency variation information to an LSP 
        during initial setup, needs to signal changes to these values to 
        both endpoints. 

     3. RSVP-TE signaling extensions 

     3.1. Cost, Latency and Latency Variation Collection Flags 

        Three Attribute flags are defined in the Attribute Flags TLV, 
        which can be set and carried in either the LSP_ATTRIBUTES or 
        LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES Objects. 

        - Cost Collection flag (to be assigned by IANA) 

        - Latency Collection flag (to be assigned by IANA) 

        - Latency Variation Collection flag (to be assigned by IANA) 

        These flags are meaningful in a Path message. If the Cost 
        Collection flag is set to 1, the transit nodes SHOULD report the 
        cost information in the Record Route Objects (RRO) of both the 
        Path and Resv messages.

     Internet-Draft    draft-ietf-ccamp-te-metric-recording-02.txt 
      
        If the Cost Collection flag is set to 1, the transit nodes 
        SHOULD report latency variation information in the Record Route 
        Objects (RRO) of both the Path and Resv messages. 

        If the Latency Collection flag is set to 1, the transit nodes 
        SHOULD report latency variation information in the Record Route 
        Objects (RRO) of both the Path and Resv messages. 

        If the Latency Variation Collection flag is set to 1, the 
        transit nodes SHOULD report latency variation information in the 
        Record Route Objects (RRO) of both the Path and Resv messages. 

        The procedure for the processing the Attribute Flags TLV follows 
        [RFC5420].  

     3.2. Cost Subobject 

        The cost subobject is defined for the RRO to record the cost 
        information of the LSP. Its format is similar to the RRO 
        subobjects (ROUTE_RECORD sub-object) defined in [RFC3209].

           set to 0 when sent and MUST be ignored when received. 

           Downstream Cost: Cost of the local link along the route of 
           the LSP in the direction of the tail-end node, encoded as a 
           32-bit integer. Based on the policy at the recording node, 
           the cost value can be set to the Interior Gateway Protocol 
           (IGP) metric or TE metric of the link in question. This 
           approach has been taken to avoid defining a flag for each 
           cost type in the Attribute-Flags TLV. It is assumed that, 
           based on policy, all nodes report the same cost-type and that

           cost value can be set to the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) 
           metric or TE metric of the link in question. This approach 
           has been taken to avoid defining a flag for each cost type in

     3.5. Signaling Procedures 

        Typically, the ingress node learns the route of an LSP by adding 
        a RRO in the Path message. If an ingress node also desires cost, 
        latency and/or latency variation recording, it sets the 
        appropriate flag(s) in the Attribute Flags TLV of the 
        LSP_ATTRIBUTES (if recording is desired but not mandatory) or 
        LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES (if recording in mandatory) Object.  
        None, all or any of the Cost Collection, Latency Collection or 
        Latency Variation Collection flags may be set in the Attribute 
        Flags TLV of the LSP_ATTRIBUTES or LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES 
        Object.  The rules for processing the LSP_ATTRIBUTES and 
        LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES Objects and RRO are not changed. The 
        corresponding sub-objects MUST be included in the RRO, with the 
        Downstream (only) information filled in. 

        When a node receives a Path message which carries an 
        LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES Object and the Cost, Latency and/or 
        Latency Variation Collection Flag(s) is (are) set, if local 
        policy disallows providing the requested information to the 
        endpoints, the node MUST return a Path Error message with error 
        code "Policy Control Failure (2)" and one of the following error 
        subcodes: 

        . "Cost Recoding Rejected" (value to be assigned by IANA, 
          suggested value 105) if Cost Collection Flag is set.  

        . "Latency Recording Rejected" (value to be assigned by IANA, 
          suggested value 106) if Latency Collection Flag is set. 

        . "Latency Variation Recording Rejected" (value to be assigned 
          by IANA, suggested value 107) if Latency Variation Collection 
          Flag is set. 

        When a node receives a Path message which carries an 
        LSP_ATTRIBUTES Object and the Cost, Latency and/or Latency 
        Variation Collection Flag(s) is (are) set, if local policy 
        disallows providing the requested information to the endpoints, 
        the Path message SHOULD NOT rejected due to Metric recording 
        restriction and the Path message is forwarded without the 
        appropriate sub-object(s) in the Path RRO.  

        If local policy permits the recording of the requested 
        information, the processing node SHOULD add the requested 
        subobject(s) with the cost, latency and/or latency variation 
        metric value(s) associated with the local hop to the Path RRO.  
        If the LSP being setup is bidirectional, both Downstream and 
        Upstream information SHOULD be included.  If the LSP is 
        unidirectional, only Downstream information SHOULD be included. 

        Following the steps described above, the intermediate nodes of 
        the LSP provide the requested metric value(s) associated with

        the local hop in the Path RRO. When the egress node receives the 
        Path message, it can calculate the end-to-end cost, latency 
        and/or latency variation properties of the LSP.  

        Before the Resv message is sent to the upstream node, the egress 
        node adds the requested subobject(s) with the downstream cost, 
        latency and/or latency variation metric value(s) associated with 
        the local hop to the Resv RRO in a similar manner to that 
        specified above for the addition of Path RRO sub-objects by 
        transit nodes. 

        Similarly, the intermediate nodes of the LSP provide the 
        requested metric value(s) associated with the local hop in the 
        Resv RRO. When the ingress node receives the Resv message, it can 
        calculate the end-to-end cost, latency and/or latency variation 
        properties of the LSP.  

        Typically, cost and latency are additive metrics, but latency 
        variation is not an additive metric. The means by which the 
        ingress and egress nodes compute the end-to-end cost, latency 
        and latency variation metric from information recorded in the 
        RRO is beyond the scope of this document.   

        Based on the local policy, the ingress and egress nodes can 
        advertise the calculated end-to-end cost, latency and/or latency 
        variation properties of the FA or RA LSP in TE link 
        advertisement to the routing instance based on the procedure 
        described in [DRAFT-OSPF-TE-METRIC], [DRAFT-ISIS-TE-METRIC]. 

        Based on the local policy, a transit node (e.g. the edge node of 
        a domain) may edit a Path or Resv RRO to remove route 
        information (e.g. node or interface identifier information) 
        before forwarding it. A node that does this SHOULD summarize the 
        cost, latency and latency variation data removed as a single 
        value for each for the loose hop that is summarized by the 
        transit node. How a transit node calculates the cost, latency o 
        and/or latency variation metric for the segment summarized by 
        the transit node is beyond the scope of this document.   

     4. Security Considerations 

        This document does not introduce any additional security issues 
        above those identified in [RFC5920], [RFC5420], [RFC2205], 
        [RFC3209], and [RFC3473]. 

     5. IANA Considerations 

     5.1. RSVP Attribute Bit Flags 

           The IANA has created a registry and manages the space of 
        attributes bit flags of Attribute Flags TLV as described in 
        section 11.3 of [RFC5420]. It is requested that the IANA makes

              - Name of bit: Latency Variation Flag 

         

        5.2. ROUTE_RECORD subobject 

           This document introduces the following three new RRO 
        subobject: 

                     Type       Name                        Reference 

                     ---------  ----------------------      --------- 

                     TBD (35)   Cost subobject              This I-D 

                     TBD (36)   Latency subobject           This I-D 

                     TBD (37)   Latency Variation subobject This I-D 

     5.2. New RSVP error sub-code  

        For Error Code = 2 "Policy Control Failure" (see [RFC2205]) the 
        following sub-code is defined. 
         
           Sub-code                              Value
