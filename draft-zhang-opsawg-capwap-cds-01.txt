        Alternate Tunnel Encapsulation for Data Frames in CAPWAP
                    draft-zhang-opsawg-capwap-cds-01

Abstract

   CAPWAP ([RFC5416]) defines two tunneling modes for encapsulating data
   frames from stations associated with WLAN: 802.3 Tunnel and 802.11
   Tunnel modes.  This document provides for an alternate tunnel
   encapsulation.  The alternate tunnel encapsulation allows 1) the WTP
   to tunnel non-management data frames to an endpoint different from
   the AC and 2) allows the WTP to tunnel using one of many known
   encapsulation types such as IP-IP, IP-GRE, CAPWAP.  The WTP may
   advertise support for Alternate Tunnel encapsulation during the
   discovery process and AC may select one of the supported Alternate
   Tunnel encapsulate types during the WTP configuration.  Further, the
   AC may configure WTP to enable the alternate tunnel encapsulation.

1.  Introduction

   CAPWAP ([RFC5415], [RFC5416]) defines a tunnel mode that specifies
   the frame tunneling type to be used for 802.11 data frames from all
   stations associated with the WLAN.  The following types are
   supported:

   o  Local Bridging: All user traffic is to be locally bridged.
   o  802.3 Tunnel: All user traffic is to be tunneled to the AC in
      802.3 format.
   o  802.11 Tunnel: All user traffic is to be tunneled to the AC in
      802.11 format.

   There are two shortcomings with currently specified tunneled modes:
   1) it does not allow the WTP to tunnel data frames to an endpoint
   different from the AC and 2) it does not allow the WTP to tunnel data
   frames using any encapsulation other than CAPWAP (as specified in
   Section 4.4.2 of [RFC5415]).  Next, we describe what is driving the
   above mentioned two requirements.

   Some operators deploying large number of Access Points prefer to
   centralize the management and control of Access Points (AP) while
   distributing the handling of data traffic to increase scaling.  This
   motivates an architecture as shown in Figure 1 that has the Access
   Controller in a centralized location and one or more tunnel gateways
   (or Access Routers) that terminate the data tunnels from the various
   WTPs. central data center.  This split architecture has two benefits
   over an architecture where data traffic is aggregated at the AC: 1)
   reduces the scale requriement on data traffic handling capability of
   the AR and 2) leads to more efficient/optimal routing of data
   traffic.

   | WTP |===========|  Access Router |
   +=====+           +----------------+


            Figure 1: Centralized Control with Distributed Data

   The above system (shown in Figure 1) could be achieved by setting the
   tunnel mode to Local bridging.  In such a case the AC would handle
   control of WTPs as well as handle the management traffic to/from the
   stations.  The data frames (non-management) from the stations would
   be handled by the local Access Router.  However, in many deployments
   the operator managing the WTPs/AC may be different from the operator
   providing the internet connectivity to the WTPs.  Further, the WTP
   operator may want (or be required by legal/regulatory requirements)
   to tunnel the traffic back to an Access Router in its network as
   shown in Figure 2.  The tunneling requirement may be driven by the
   need to apply policy at the Access Router or a legal requirement to
   support lawful intercept of user traffic.  This motivates the need
   for the WTP to support an alternate Tunnel encapsulation support
   where the data tunnels from the WTP are terminated at an AR (and more
   specifically at an end point different from the AC).

   In the case where the WTP is tunneling data frames to an AR (and not
   the AC), the choice of tunnel encapsulation need not be restricted
   only to CAPWAP (as described in Section 4.4.2 of [RFC5415]).  In
   fact, the WTP may additionally support other widely used
   encapsulation types such as L2TP, L2TPv3, IP-in-IP, IP/GRE, etc.  The
   WTP may advertise the different alterante tunnel encapsulation types
   supported and the AC can select one of the supported encapsulation
   types.
