             Email transfer in the IPv6 introduction phase
                   draft-mrosenau-email-ipv4-to-6-00

Abstract

   During the introduction phase of IPv6 (as of Jan 2013) many existing
   mail servers are not able to do IPv6 communication, yet.  However new
   networks will be assigned IPv6 addresses only so new mail servers
   will not be able to do IPv4 communication.

   This document proposes the installation of special servers that are
   able to route mail between IPv4-only and IPv6-only mail servers to
   solve this problem.

1.  Background

   As of the end 2012 IPv4 addresses are no longer available to
   companies.  For this reason new mail servers (especially mail servers
   of companies that do not have IPv4 addresses, yet) are IPv6-only.
   The introcuction of IPv6 on existing mail servers, however, is often
   not done right now.

   RFC 3974 proposes that every mail server should have an IPv4 address
   even if it is able to do IPv6.  However this is no longer possible
   due to the depletion of IPv4 addresses.

   For this reason it may be impossible to send an electronic mail from
   a domain that has an IPv4-only server to a domain using an IPv6-only
   server and vice versa.

2.  Implementation

2.1.  Tunnel servers

   This document proposes the installation of IPv4-to-IPv6 translation
   servers to manage the problem.  Such a server would work the
   following way:

   o  Accept incoming SMTP connections on IPv4 AND IPv6

   o  For each mail "received" simply forward the received mail to the
      SMTP server that is really responsible for the destination address

   In our example such servers have the addresses 192.0.1.30 and
   192.0.1.31.  The DNS configuration may look like this:

         example.org.            IN MX   1  mx1.example.org.
         example.com.            IN MX   1  mx1.example.com.
         ip4only.example.        IN MX   1  mx1.ip4only.example.
         mail-tunnel.example.    IN AAAA 2001:db8:ffff::1
         mail-tunnel.example.    IN AAAA 2001:db8:ffff::2
         mail-tunnel.example.    IN A    192.0.1.30
         mail-tunnel.example.    IN A    192.0.1.31
         mx1.example.org.        IN AAAA 2001:db8:ffff::1:1
         mx1.example.org.        IN A    192.0.1.30
         mx1.example.org.        IN A    192.0.1.31
         mx1.example.com.        IN AAAA 2001:db8:ffff::2:1
         mx1.example.com.        IN A    192.0.1.30
         mx1.example.com.        IN A    192.0.1.31
         mx1.ip4only.example.    IN A    192.0.2.1

   Note that mx1.example.com and mx1.example.org are different (!)
   servers.  However the IPv4 address in the DNS configuration is the
   same.  The DNS query for their IPv4 address will result in the IPv4
   address of the server "mail-tunnel.example" because they do not
   support IPv4.

2.2.  IPv4-to-IPv6 mail transport

   Scenario: An Email is sent from example@ip4only.example to
   example@example.com.

   The mail server of the domain ip4only.example will now query the IPv4
   address of mx1.example.com.  The DNS server will return the address
   192.0.1.30 which is in fact the address of the tunnel server.

   The mail is now delivered to the tunnel server, that then forwards
   the mail to the actual mail server.

2.3.  IPv6-to-IPv4 mail transport

   Scenario: An Email is sent from example@example.com to
   example@ipv4only.example.

   The mail server of the domain example.com will now query the IPv6
   address of mx1.ipv4only.example.  The DNS server will return no
   result.

   In this case the mail server's implementation must be done in a way
   to allow transmission to IPv4-only domains: It must detect this case
   and directly connect the tunnel server or use other tunneling
   mechanisms that allow connecting the IPv4 mail server using a TCP
   connection from an IPv6-only network directly (like NAT64).

   Note: If an IPv6 mail server has access to NAT64 and DNS64 it can
   send mail directly to an IPv4 mail server
