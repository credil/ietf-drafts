1. Introduction

   As described in [RFC4206], H-LSP (Hierarchical LSP) can be used for
   carrying one or more other LSPs. [RFC6107] further mentions the
   implementation of H-LSP. In packet networks, e.g. MPLS networks, H-
   LSP mechanism can be implemented by MPLS label stack. In non-packet
   networks where the label is implicit, label stacks are not possible,
   and H-LSPs rely on the ability to nest switching technologies. Thus,
   for example, a lambda switch capable (LSC) LSP can carry a time
   division multiplexing (TDM) LSP, but cannot carry another LSC LSP.

   S-LSP (LSP Stitching), which is defined in [RFC5150], is an LSP that
   represents a segment of another LSP, i.e., the S-LSP is viewed as
   one hop by another LSP. As described in [RFC6107], in the data plane
   the LSPs are stitched so that there is no label stacking or nesting.


Zhang                       Expires 2012                      [Page 2]

draft-zhang-ccamp-srlg-fa-configuration-04.txt             October 2011


   Thus, an S-LSP must be of the same switching technology as the end-
   to-end LSP that it facilitates.

   Therefore, H-LSP mechanism can be used in both multi-domain and
   multi-layer scenarios and S-LSP mechanism can only be used in multi-
   domain scenario.

   Both of the H-LSP and S-LSP can be advertised as a TE link in a
   GMPLS routing instance for path computation purpose. As described in
   [RFC6107], if the LSP (H-LSP or S-LSP) is advertised in the same
   instance of the control plane that advertises the TE links from
   which the LSP is constructed, the LSP is called an FA.

   In multi-domain or multi-layer context, the path information of an
   LSP may not be provided to the ingress node for confidential reasons
   and the ingress node may not run the same routing instance with the
   intermediate nodes traversed by the path. In such scenarios, the
   ingress node can not get the SRLG information of the path
   information which the LSP traverse.

   Even if the ingress node has the same routing instance with the
   intermediate nodes traversed by the path, the path information of
   the H-LSP or S-LSP may not be provided to the ingress node. Hence
   the ingress node may also not know the SRLG of the path the LSP
   traverses.

   In the case that the ingress node does not get the SRLG of the path
   the LSP traverses(i.e. H-LSP or S-LSP), there are disadvantages as
   follows:

   o SRLG-disjoint path, for instance in case of end-to-end path
   protection, cannot be calculated

   o Intermediate nodes of a pre-planned shared restoration LSP cannot
   correctly decide on the SRLG-disjointness between two PPRO
   (PRIMARY_PATH_ROUTE Object)

   o In case that an LSP is advertised as a TE-Link, the ingress node
   cannot provide the correct SRLG for the TE-Link automatically

   In case that an LSP is advertised as a TE-Link, the SRLG information
   of the TE link needs to be configured manually or automatically.
   However, for manual configuration, there are some disadvantages
   (e.g., require configuration coordination and additional management;
   manual errors may be introduced) mentioned in Section 1.3.4 of
   [RFC6107].

draft-zhang-ccamp-srlg-fa-configuration-04.txt             October 2011


   In addition, Section 1.2 of [RFC6107] describes it is desirable to
   have a kind of automatic mechanism to advertise the FA (i.e., to
   signal an LSP and automatically coordinate its use and
   advertisement in any of the ways with minimum involvement from an
   operator).

   Thus, in order to provide the SRLG information to the TE link
   automatically when an LSP (H-LSP or S-LSP) is advertised as a TE
   link, allow disjoint path calculation at ingress and allow correct
   pre-planned shared LSP to correctly share resource, this document
   provides an automatic mechanism to collect the SRLG used by a LSP
   automatically.

2. RSVP-TE Requirements

2.1. SRLG Collection Indication

   The head nodes of the LSP must be capable of indicating whether the
   SRLG information of the LSP should be collected during the signaling
   procedure of setting up an LSP.

2.2. SRLG Collection

   The SRLG information can be collected during the setup of an LSP.
   Then the endpoints of the LSP can get the SRLG information and use
   it for routing, sharing and TE link configuration purposes.

2.3. SRLG Update

   When the SRLG information changes, the endpoints of the LSP need to
   be capable of updating the SRLG information of the path. It means
   that the signaling should be capable of updating the newly SRLG
   information to the endpoints.

3. RSVP-TE Extensions

3.1. SRLG Collection Flag

   In order to indicate nodes that SRLG collection is desired, this
   document defines a new flag in the Attribute Flags TLV, which is
   carried in an LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES Object:

   o Bit Number (to be assigned by IANA, recommended bit zero): SRLG
   Collection flag

   The SRLG Collection flag is meaningful on a Path message. If the
   SRLG Collection flag is set to 1, it means that the SRLG information

draft-zhang-ccamp-srlg-fa-configuration-04.txt             October 2011


   should be reported to the head and tail node along the setup of the
   LSP.

   The rules of the processing of the Attribute Flags TLV are not
   changed.

3.2. SRLG sub-object

   This document defines a new RRO sub-object (ROUTE_RECORD sub-object)
   to record the SRLG information of the LSP. Its format is modeled on
   the RRO sub-objects defined in [RFC3209].

            is recommended 34.

         Length

            The Length contains the total length of the sub-object in
            bytes, including the Type and Length fields. The Length
            depends on the number of SRLG IDs.

            transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.

   The rules of the processing of the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES Object
   and ROUTE_RECORD Object are not changed.

4. Signaling Procedures

4.1. SRLG Collection

   Typically, the head node gets the route information of an LSP by
   adding a RRO which contains the sender's IP addresses in the Path
   message. If a head node also desires SRLG recording, it sets the
   SRLG Collection Flag in the Attribute Flags TLV which can be carried
   in an LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES Object.

   When a node receives a Path message which carries an
   LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES Object and the SRLG Collection Flag is set,
   if local policy determines that the SRLG information should not be
   provided to the endpoints, it must return a PathErr message to
   reject the Path message. Otherwise, it must add an SRLG sub-object
   to the RRO to carry the local SRLG information. Then it forwards the
   Path message to the next node in the downstream direction.

   Following the steps described above, the intermediate nodes of the
   LSP can collect the SRLG information in the RRO during the
   forwarding of the Path message hop by hop. When the Path message
   arrives at the tail node, the tail node can get the SRLG information
   from the RRO.

   Before the Resv message is sent to the upstream node, the tail node
   adds an SRLG sub-object to the RRO. The collected SRLG information
   can be carried in the SRLG sub-object. Therefore, during the
   forwarding of the Resv message in the upstream direction, the SRLG
   information is not needed to be collected hop by hop.

   Based on the above procedure, the endpoints can get the SRLG
   information automatically. Then the endpoints can for instance
   advertise it as a TE link to the routing instance based on the
   procedure described in [RFC6107] and configure the SRLG information
   of the FA automatically.

   It is noted that a node (e.g. the edge node of a domain) may edit
   the RRO to remove the route information (e.g. node, interface
   identifier information) before forwarding it due to some reasons
   (e.g. confidentiality or reduce the size of RRO), but the SRLG
   information should be retained if it is desirable for the endpoints
   of the LSP.

4.2. SRLG Update

   When the SRLG information of a link is changed, the LSPs using that
   link should be aware of the changes. The procedures defined in


Zhang                       Expires 2012                      [Page 6]

draft-zhang-ccamp-srlg-fa-configuration-04.txt             October 2011


   Section 4.4.3 of [RFC 3209] MUST be used to refresh the SRLG
   information.

5. Manageability Considerations

5.1. Policy Configuration

   In a border node of inter-domain or inter-layer network, the
   following SRLG processing policy should be capable of being
   configured:

   o Whether the SRLG IDs of the domain or specific layer network can
   be exposed to the nodes outside the domain or layer network.

   o If the SRLG IDs must not be exposed to the nodes outside of the
   domain or specific layer network by policy, the border node must
   reject the Path message desiring SRLG recording and send a PathErr
   message with the defined error code ''Policy Control Failure''/''Inter-
   domain policy failure''.

5.2. Coherent SRLG IDs

   In a multi-layer multi-domain scenario, SRLG ids may be configured
   by different management entities in each layer/domain. In such
   scenarios, maintaining a coherent set of SRLG IDs is a key
   requirement in order to be able to use the SRLG information properly.
   Thus, SRLG IDs must be unique. Note that current procedure is
   targeted towards a scenario where the different layers and domains
   belong to the same operator, or to several coordinated
   administrative groups.

   Further scenarios, where coherence in the SRLG IDs cannot be
   guaranteed are out of the scope of the present document and are left
   for further study.

6. IANA Considerations

6.1. RSVP Attribute Bit Flags

   The IANA has created a registry and manages the space of attributes
   bit flags of Attribute Flags TLV as described in section 11.3 of
   [RFC5420]. It is requested that the IANA makes assignments from the
   Attribute Bit Flags.

   This document introduces a new Attribute Bit Flag:

      - Bit number: TBD (0)
