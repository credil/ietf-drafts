                draft-shen-mpls-rsvp-setup-protection-01

Abstract

   RFC 4090 specifies an RSVP facility-backup fast reroute mechanism
   that can protect LSPs against link and node failures.  This document
   extends the mechanism to provide "setup protection" for LSPs during
   initial Path message signaling time.  In particular, it enables a
   router to reroute an LSP via an existing bypass LSP, when there is a
   link or node failure along the desired path.

Internet-Draft            RSVP Setup Protection           September 2012


1.  Introduction

   In RSVP facility-backup fast reroute (FRR) [RFC 4090], the router at
   a point of local repair (PLR) of an LSP can redirect traffic via a
   bypass LSP upon a failure of the immediate downstream link or node.
   Such kind of protection is normally established after the PLR has
   received a Resv message of the LSP.  In link protection, the PLR must
   learn the label and address of the next-hop router, before it can set
   up or select a bypass LSP to protect the LSP.  Likewise, in node
   protection, the PLR must learn the label and address of the next-
   next-hop router.  The information of the label and the address is
   carried in the Resv message.

   Imagine a scenario where an LSP is being signaled, but its Path
   message carries an EXPLICIT_ROUTE object (ERO) that is statically
   configured or computed based on a topology that may not reflect the
   current state of every link or node of the network.  If a link or
   node along this path is in a failure condition, RSVP signaling will
   halt at the router immediate upstream of the failure.  This will be
   the case even if there is an existing bypass LSP protecting the link
   or node for some other LSPs.  In other words, the LSP is not
   protected during its setup time, i.e. the initial Path message
   signaling time.

   In this situation, the network would rely on IGP to flood the up-to-
   date traffic engineering (TE) information, and the router immediate
   upstream of the failure to send a PathErr message to notify the
   ingress router.  The ingress router can then compute and signal a new
   path to avoid the failed link or node.  However, this approach may
   not always be possible or desirable, as in the scenarios below.

   1.  Pre-configured or pre-defined paths.  If the path is pre-
       configured or pre-defined, and the ingress router is incapable of
       computing a new path, the LSP will not be set up.

   2.  LSPs with a strict requirement for setup time.  IGP TE
       information flooding, PathErr message propagation, path re-
       computation, and RSVP re-signaling may introduce a significant
       delay to LSP establishment.  This may impact on signaling
       performance for services that have a strict requirement for LSP
       setup time, such as an on-demand transport service for real-time
       data.

   3.  Sibling P2MP sub-LSPs sharing a failed link.  In this case, the
       LSP being signaled is a sub-LSP of a P2MP LSP, and it is supposed
       to share the failed link with an existing sibling sub-LSP (i.e.
       another sub-LSP of the same P2MP LSP) which is being protected by
       a bypass LSP.  If the new sub-LSP is rerouted via a different

       path, it will not be able to share the data flow over the bypass
       LSP with that sibling sub-LSP, and unnecessary traffic flow will
       be generated in the network.

   This document extends the RSVP facility-backup fast reroute mechanism
   to provide so-called "setup protection" for LSPs.  During the initial
   Path message signaling of an LSP, if there is a link or node failure
   along the desired path, and if there is a bypass LSP protecting the
   link or node, the LSP will be signaled through the bypass LSP.  The
   LSP will be established as if it was originally set up along the
   desired primary path and then failed over to the bypass LSP after the
   link or node failure.  When the link or node is restored, the LSP MAY
   be reverted to the primary path.  The mechanism supports both P2P and
   P2MP LSPs.


2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


3.  Theory of Operation

   When an LSP is being signaled by RSVP, a Path message is sent hop by
   hop from the ingress router to the egress router, following the path
   defined by an ERO.  The setup protection mechanism in this document
   enables an ingress or transit router to reroute the LSP via a bypass
   LSP, if the router detects a failure of the immediate downstream link
   or node represented by the next hop in the ERO, i.e. next ERO hop.
   This router is referred to as a PLR.

   The mechanism is relevant when the Path message carries the "local
   protection desired" flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object [RFC 4090]
   and a new "setup protection desired" flag defined in this document
   (Section 3.1).

   On a PLR, the mechanism is only applicable when the next ERO hop is a
   strict hop, and in case of node protection, the next-next ERO hop is
   also a strict hop.  A strict next ERO hop allows the PLR to
   unambiguously decide the intended downstream link or node on the
   desired path, and hence reliably detect the status of the link or
   node.  In link protection, the strict next ERO hop also indicates the
   merge point (MP), i.e. the destination of the bypass LSP to be used
   for rerouting the LSP.  In node protection, the strict next-next ERO
   hop indicates the MP.

Internet-Draft            RSVP Setup Protection           September 2012


   When performing setup protection, the PLR signals a backup LSP by
   tunneling a Path message through the bypass LSP.  Like the Path
   message of a backup LSP in the normal facility-backup FRR, this Path
   message carries an address of the PLR as the sender address.  In
   addition, the Path message also carries some information of the
   protected LSP (Section 3.2).  When the MP receives the Path message,
   it terminates the backup LSP, and then re-creates the protected LSP.
   If the MP is a transit router of the protected LSP, it signals the
   LSP further downstream.

   Eventually, the LSP will be established end to end, with the backup
   LSP tunneled through the bypass LSP from the PLR to the MP.  The RSVP
   state on the PLR and the MP and the RSVP messages generated by these
   routers are no different than those of an LSP in a post-failure
   situation of the normal facility-backup FRR.

   After the link or node is restored, the PLR MAY revert the LSP to the
   primary path, in the same manner as the local revertive mode
   specified in [RFC 4090].

   The setup protection mode MAY be enabled and disabled on a router
   based on configuration.  For an LSP to be setup-protected, the mode
   MUST be enabled on both PLR and MP.  If it is enabled on a PLR but
   disabled on an MP, the MP SHOULD reject the Path message of the
   backup LSP and send a PathErr message, as described Section 3.4.

3.1.  New RSVP Attribute Flag

   In order to facilitate explicit request for setup protection, this
   document defines a new "setup protection desired" flag in the
   Attribute Flags TLV, which is carried in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object
   [RFC5420] of the Path message of a protected LSP.

3.2.  New RSVP Attributes TLVs

   This document defines two new RSVP Attributes TLVs [RFC 5420].  They
   are used by a PLR to convey to an MP the original sender address of a
   protected LSP.  Both TLVs are carried in the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES
   object in the Path message of a backup LSP.

   o  Protected LSP Sender IPv4 Address TLV

   o  Protected LSP Sender IPv6 Address TLV

   Length

      20

   Value

      Original sender address in the IPv6 SENDER_TEMPLATE object of the
      protected LSP.

3.3.  PLR behavior

   When a router has a Path message to send out, if the Path message
   carries the "local protection desired" flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE
   object and the "setup protection desired" flag in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES
   object, and if the next ERO hop is a strict IPv4 or IPv6 prefix, the
   router SHOULD validate the prefix against the routing table, the
   traffic engineering (TE) database, and/or a topology database.  If
   the prefix is reachable and is one hop away from the router, the Path
   message is sent as it is.  Otherwise, there is a possibility that the
   link or node represented by the prefix has experienced a failure.

   The router SHOULD determine this by searching for an existing bypass
   LSP that is protecting the prefix.  If the protected LSP desires link
   protection, the destination of the bypass LSP (i.e.  MP) is
   considered as the router that owns the prefix.  If the LSP desires
   node protection with the "node protection desired" flag set in the
   SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object, the next-next ERO hop of the LSP must also
   be a strict prefix, and the MP is considered as the router that owns
   this prefix.

   If a bypass LSP is not found, the router MUST originate a PathErr
   with code = 24 (routing problem) and sub-code = 2 (bad strict node).

Internet-Draft            RSVP Setup Protection           September 2012


   If a bypass LSP is found, the router MUST act as a PLR of setup
   protection, and reroute the protected LSP via the bypass LSP.  If
   multiple satisfactory bypass LSPs exist, the PLR MAY select one based
   on bandwidth constraints or local policies.  If the protected LSP is
   a sub-LSP of a P2MP LSP, a bypass LSP that is protecting an existing
   sibling sub-LSP MUST be preferred, in order to minimize traffic
   duplication in the network.

   The PLR SHOULD NOT send a Path message for the protected LSP.
   Instead, it MUST create a backup LSP, and send a Path message of the
   backup LSP to the MP via the bypass LSP.  The Path message is
   constructed by using the sender template specific method [RFC 4090].
   In particular, it has the sender address in the SENDER_TEMPLATE
   object set to an address of the PLR.  It MUST also carry an
   LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object containing a Protected LSP Sender IPv4
   Address TLV or Protected LSP Sender IPv6 Address TLV.

   Upon receiving a Resv message of the backup LSP from the MP, the PLR
   SHOULD brings up both of the backup LSP and the protected LSP.  If
   the PLR is the ingress router of the protected LSP, the LSP has been
   set up successfully.  If the PLR is a transit router, it MUST send a
   Resv message upstream for the protected LSP, with the "local
   protection available", "local protection in use", and optionally
   "node protection" and "bandwidth protection" flags set to 1 in the
   RRO hop corresponding to the PLR [RFC 4090].  The PLR SHOULD
   originate a PathErr message with code = 25 (notify error) and sub-
   code = 3 (tunnel locally repaired).

   The PLR SHOULD also install a forwarding entry for the protected LSP.
   The next-hop of this entry MAY indicate zero, one, or two outgoing
   labels, depending on whether any of the backup LSP's label and the
   bypass LSP's label is Implicit NULL.  In the case of two labels, the
   inner label is the backup LSP's label, and the outer label is the
   bypass LSP's label.

   If the PLR receives a PathErr message when signaling the backup LSP,
   the PLR MUST NOT bring up the backup LSP or the protected LSP.  If
   the PLR is a transit router of the protected LSP, it MUST send a
   PathErr message upstream for the protected LSP.  Likewise, if the PLR
   receives a PathErr message after the backup LSP and the primary LSP
   have been set up, and the PLR is a transit router of the protected
   LSP, it MUST also send a PathErr message upstream for the protected
   LSP.

   When the PLR receives a ResvTear message of the backup LSP, the PLR
   MUST bring down both the backup LSP and the protected LSP.  If the
   PLR is a transit router of the protected LSP, it MUST send a ResvTear
   message upstream for the protected LSP.

Internet-Draft            RSVP Setup Protection           September 2012


   In any cases where the PLR tears down the protected LSP due to a
   received PathTear message, RSVP state time-out, configuration change,
   administrative command, etc, the PLR MUST also tear down the backup
   LSP by sending a PathTear message through the bypass LSP.

3.4.  MP behavior

   When an MP receives the Path message of a backup LSP, it SHOULD
   detect the setup protection condition based on the presence of
   Protected LSP Sender IPv4 Address TLV or Protected LSP Sender IPv6
   Address TLV in LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object.

   If setup protection mode is disabled on the MP, it MUST reject the
   Path message, by sending a PathErr with code = 2 (policy control
   failure) to the PLR.

   Otherwise, the MP MUST terminate the backup LSP and re-create the
   protected LSP.  If the MP is the egress router of the protected LSP,
   it MUST also terminate the protected LSP.  If the MP is a transit
   router of the LSP, it MUST send a Path message downstream for the
   protected LSP.  The Path message has the sender address in
   SENDER_TEMPLATE object set to the original address of the ingress
   router, based on the above received TLV.  The Path message MUST NOT
   carry the Protected LSP Sender IPv4 Address TLV or Protected LSP
   Sender IPv6 Address TLV received in the above LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES
   object.

   The MP MUST allocate a label for the backup LSP, and distribute it to
   the PLR via the Resv message of the backup LSP.  If the protected LSP
   is a sub-LSP of a P2MP LSP and there is an existing sibling sub-LSP,
   the MP SHOULD allocate the same label as the sibling sub-LSP, in
   order to avoid traffic duplication in the network.

   When the MP receives a PathTear message of the backup LSP, it MUST
   tear down both the backup LSP and the protected LSP.  If the MP is a
   transit router of the protected LSP, it MUST send a PathTear message
   downstream.

   In any cases where the MP receives or originates a PathErr or
   ResvTear message for the protected LSP, the MP SHOULD translate the
   message to a message of the backup LSP and send it to the PLR.

3.5.  Local Revertive Mode

   When the failed link or node is restored, the PLR MAY revert the
   protected LSP to its desired primary path, by following the procedure
   of local revertive mode described in [RFC 4090].

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new flag in the Attribute Flags TLV, which is
   carried in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES Object of Path message.  This flag is
   used to communicate whether setup protection is desired for an LSP.
   New flag value needs to be assigned to it by IANA.

      Setup Protection Desired: TBD

   This document defines two new RSVP Attributes TLVs, which are carried
   in the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object of Path message.  New type
   values need to be assigned to them by IANA.

      Protected LSP Sender IPv6 Address TLV


5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations discussed in RFC 3209, RFC 4090 and RFC
   4875 apply to this document.
