      <abstract>
	<t>This document proposes a specific word usage for specifications of
	DANE like technology by different protocols/services. 
	DANE is a method for specifying in DNS records acceptable 
	keys/certificates for application servers. </t> 
      </abstract>

  <section title="Introduction"> 
    <t> DANE <xref target="RFC6698" /> is a powerful new way to
    provide/amend how authentication/authorization/confidencialty of
    a connection to a server can be protected by leveraging DNS 
    <xref target="RFC1034" />
    and DNSSEC
    <xref target="RFC4033" /> 
    <xref target="RFC4034" /> 
    <xref target="RFC4035" /> 
    for the establishment of TLS connection <xref target="RFC5246"/>
    <xref target="RFC6347" /> which in many cases uses PKIX <xref
    target="RFC5280" />. All of these technologies are complicated.  
    People familiar with one or two are not necessarily familiar with
    all the parts that needed to apply DANE like mechanism to other protocols. 
  </t> 
    <t> The goal of this document is two fold: 
    <list style="symbols"> 
      <t>To provide an overview of the non protocol specific parts needed 
      to specify an DANE like addition. </t>
      <t> To provide a common framework for such specifications making
      it easy to review/compare the specifications. An important goal
      is to allow the new specifications to avoid repeating
      explanations and/or definitions. </t>
    </list>
    </t> 
    <t> This version of the document aims to hide complexity and focus
    on generalities. This is done to make it easier for the reader to
    decide if the terms here are of use and if it is worthwhile for
    the DANE WG to adopt this document. Descriptions of complexities
    can be added in later versions if the WG decides that is needed. 
    </t>
    <t> 
      When below the notation "foo/bar" is used that is because the
      editor is not sure if both apply or which one is more appropriate,
      please advise.  
    </t> 
    <section title="Requirements notation">
      <t>
	The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
	"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
	this
	document are to be interpreted as described in
	<xref target="RFC2119" />.
      </t>
    </section>
  </section> 

  <section title="Proposed Terms"> 
    <t> The terms below are being proposed to avoid confusion when
    reading DANE like specifications for various application
    protocols. 
    </t> 
    <t> At this point all the terms below are proposals and better terms
    are welcome. </t> 
    <section title="DNS Navigation Records" anchor="DNS"> 
      <t> DNS Navigation refers to any records used to traverse 
      the DNS tree to find the records requested. This includes 
      <list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
	<t hangText="NS records:"> 
	  that provide a referral to DNS servers for more specific
	  part of the name being looked up. Example: name server for
	  "example." will hand out a referral to server for
	  "bar.example." when asked about "foo.bar.example."
	</t> 
	<t hangText="CNAME records:"> 
	  records that change the location of an record, this for all
	  practical purposes a pointer that only applies to that
	  specific name. 
	</t> 
	<t hangText="DNAME records:"> 
	  specify a rewrite rule for a name to a new name. 
	  Example: "bar.example." DNAME "foo.example." means that 
	  "www.bar.example." is to be looked up as
	  "www.foo.example". DNAME applies to names that are longer
	  than the name it, i.e. "bar.example." is not rewritten but
	  "www.bar.example." is
	</t> 
      </list> 
      DANE specification explicitly requires all of these records to
      be validated by DNSSEC. 
      See section <xref target="Integrity"/> 
      </t> 

      <t> While traversing the DNS tree other records like A and AAAA
      are used but these records do not change the "navigation", these
      records do not explicitly need to be protected as the data
      retrieved from the addresses is expected to be protected.
      </t> 
    </section>

    <section title="DNS Integrity" anchor="Integrity">
      <t>
	DNSSEC defines a records and procedures to provide integrity and
	authentication to data stored in DNS <xref target="RFC4034"
	/>.  The records used to
	provide the keying information and chain of trust are DNSKEY, DS
	records.  NSEC/NSEC3 provide information about existence/non-
	existence of the requested information.  RRSIG provides a digital
      signature for a RRset.</t>
      
      <t>DNSSEC provides both Integrity and Authenticity i.e. it says the
      records came from the right source and have not been changed.</t>
      
      <t>Any DNS record that is DNS Integrity protected, will pass DNSSEC
      validation for all DNS Navigation records leading to the name and the
      record itself also passes DNSSEC validation.</t>
      <t>In the case of CNAME and DNAME that go "sideways" i.e. to a
      different branch of the DNS tree, both branches MUST be
      validated.</t> 
    </section>
    
    <section title="Service Specification Records" anchor="Service"> 
      <t> Protocols have different ways to provide information about
      where servers are located. Web servers are frequently specified
      by name i.e. the "www" prefix. Email servers have a special RR type
      (MX), Jabber uses SRV records, ENUM uses NAPTR records etc. and
      there are also protocols that use a combination like S-NAPTR
      a schema where NAPTR records are used to specify where to look
      for SRV records. 
      </t>
      <t> For a DANE like specification it has to be clear as what the
      service specification records are and that these records use
      requires DNS Integrity.
      </t> 
      <t> NOTE: when NAPTR records as are used they should be the same
      way as DNS Navigation records even though strictly speaking it
      is the application that evaluates the NAPTR record. </t> 
      <t> NOTE: When there is a CNAME at the name service is expected
      to be specified at, that can be either a DNS Navigation record or a
      Service Specification Record. Protocol specification should
      provide guidance on interpretation. </t>
    </section> 

    <section title="Service Address Records" anchor="Addr"> 
      <t> 
	This is where the address records used by the servers
	reside, specifications SHOULD not make a difference between
	what kind of address records are used.
      </t>
      <t> 
	In some cases the Service Specification records reside at the
	same name as the Service Address records like for the original TLS
	RFC, thus both kinds of records are covered by the same DNS
	integrity rules. 
      </t> 
    </section> 

    <section title="Application Authentication Records" anchor="Auth"> 
      <t> This term refers to the records that provide information
      about what are acceptable keys or certificates for the servers to
      offer. 
      </t> 
      <t> Application Authentication Records MUST be protected by DNS
      Integrity and each protocol specification MUST explicitly state
      where/how to look up the Authentication records.
      </t> 
      <t> In some cases all the servers for a service will have the
      same authentication information, in other cases it is going to be
      on a server by server case. In the first case it is "natural" to
      store the Authentication records "at" the Service
      Specification records. In the second case it more natural to
      store them "at" the Address Records. 
      In this context "at" means the authentication
      records are stored at name that is an extension of the location
      example: "_443._tcp.www.example.com" for <xref
      target="RFC6698" />. It is possible that neither of these
      locations is the right one and in that case the specification
      MUST explicitly express rules as how to find the Authentication
      Records. 
      </t>
     
    <t> 
      Note: above that there is no a requirement that the Application
      Address records be covered by DNS Integrity. This is because
      when the Application Authentication records reside "at" the
      address records, DNS Integrity is inherited. On the other hand
      when when Application Authentication Records are stored
      "at" the Service Specification Record, DNS Integrity for the
      address records is optional, as any connection to 
      a bogus/wrong server should fail the Authentication tests
      performed at connection time. 
    </t>

  </section>

  <section title="Example specifcation"> 
    <t> This section is an short example for a protocol that is like SSH 
    <xref target="RFC4253"/> we will call this protocol HISS. This is
    not an actual full specification, just here to give an idea of how
    to go about extending DANE-like to a random protocol using the
    terminology from this document. 
    </t>  
    <t>Location of HISS protocol DNS records:  
    <list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
      <t hangText="Service Specifcation Records:">
       <vspace />
       HISS uses address records as the service specification
       record. This record MUST have "DNS Integrity" as explained in
       RFC-to-be-this-document.   CNAME is treated as a DNS 
       Navigation record. 
      </t>
      <t hangText="Service Address Records:">
       <vspace />
       see: Service Specification Records. 
      </t>
      <t hangText="Application Authentication Records:">
       <vspace />
       The protocol uses the DNS HISSFP that is stored at the same
       name as the service is specified. The HISSFP record, if
       present, takes precedence over keys stored in client cache. 
      </t> 
    </list> 
    </t> 
    <t> The HISS protocol and HISSFP DNS RR do not exist</t>
