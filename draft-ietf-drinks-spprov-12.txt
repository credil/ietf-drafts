            Session Peering Provisioning Protocol Data Model
                      draft-ietf-drinks-spprov-12

Abstract

   This document specifies the data model and the overall structure for
   a protocol to provision session establishment data into Session Data
   Registries and SIP Service Provider data stores.  The protocol is
   called the Session Peering Provisioning Protocol (SPPP).  The
   provisioned data is typically used by network elements for session
   peering.

1.  Introduction

   Service providers and enterprises use registries to make session
   routing decisions for Voice over IP, SMS and MMS traffic exchanges.
   This document is narrowly focused on the provisioning protocol for
   these registries.  This protocol prescribes a way for an entity to
   provision session-related data into a registry.  The data being
   provisioned can be optionally shared with other participating peering
   entities.  The requirements and use cases driving this protocol have
   been documented in [I-D.ietf-drinks-usecases-requirements].  The
   reader is expected to be familiar with the terminology defined in the
   previously mentioned document.

   Three types of provisioning flows have been described in the use case
   document: client to registry provisioning, registry to local data
   repository and registry to registry.  This document addresses client
   to registry aspect to fulfill the need to provision Session
   Establishment Data (SED).  The protocol that supports flow of
   messages to facilitate client to registry provisioning is referred to
   as Session Peering Provisioning Protocol (SPPP).

   Please note that the role of the "client" and the "server" only
   applies to the connection, and those roles are not related in any way
   to the type of entity that participates in a protocol exchange.  For
   example, a registry might also include a "client" when such a
   registry initiates a connection (for example, for data distribution
   to SSP).

                     Three Registry Provisioning Flows

                                 Figure 1

   The data provisioned for session establishment is typically used by
   various downstream SIP signaling systems to route a call to the next
   hop associated with the called domain.  These systems typically use a
   local data store ("Local Data Repository") as their source of session
   routing information.  More specifically, the SED data is the set of
   parameters that the outgoing signaling path border elements (SBEs)
   need to initiate the session.  See [RFC5486] for more details.

   A "terminating" SIP Service Provider (SSP) provisions SED into the
   registry to be selectively shared with other peer SSPs.
   Subsequently, a registry may distribute the provisioned data into
   local data repositories used for look-up queries (identifier -> URI)
   or for lookup and location resolution (identifier -> URI -> ingress
   SBE of terminating SSP).  In some cases, the registry may
   additionally offer a central query resolution service (not shown in
   the above figure).

   A key requirement for the SPPP protocol is to be able to accommodate
   two basic deployment scenarios:

   1.  A resolution system returns a Look-Up Function (LUF) that
       comprises of the target domain to assist in call routing (as
       described in [RFC5486]).  In this case, the querying entity may
       use other means to perform the Location Routing Function (LRF)

Internet-Draft             draft-drinks-spprov             November 2011


       which in turn helps determine the actual location of the
       Signaling Function in that domain.

   2.  A resolution system returns both a Look-Up function (LUF) and
       Location Routing Function (LRF) to locate the SED data fully.

   In terms of protocol design, SPPP is agnostic to the transport.  This
   document includes the specification of the data model and identifies,
   but does not specify, the means to enable protocol operations within
   a request and response structure.  That aspect of the specification
   has been delegated to the "transport" specification for the protocol.
   To encourage interoperability, the protocol supports extensibility
   aspects.

   Transport requirements are provided in this document to help with the
   selection of the optimum transport mechanism.
   ([I-D.ietf-drinks-sppp-over-soap]) identifies a SOAP transport
   mechanism for SPPP.

   This document is organized as follows:

   o    Section 2 provides the terminology;

   o    Section 3 provides an overview of SPPP, including the functional
        entities and data model;

   o    Section 4 specifies requirements for SPPP transport protocols;

   o    Section 5 describes the base protocol data structures, the
        generic response types that MUST be supported by a conforming
        "transport" specification, and the basic object type most first
        class objects extend from;

   o    Section 6 detailed descriptoins of the data model object
        specifications;

   o    Section 8 defines XML considerations that XML parsers must meet
        to conform to this specification;

   o    Section 11 normatively defines the SPPP protocol using its XML
        Schema Definition.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document reuses terms from [RFC3261], [RFC5486], use cases and
   requirements documented in [I-D.ietf-drinks-usecases-requirements]
   and the ENUM Validation Architecture [RFC4725].

   In addition, this document specifies the following additional terms:


   SPPP:   Session Peering Provisioning Protocol, the protocol used to
      provision data into a Registry (see arrow labeled "1." in Figure 1
      of [I-D.ietf-drinks-usecases-requirements]).  It is the primary
      scope of this document.


   SPDP:   Session Peering Distribution Protocol, the protocol used to
      distribute data to Local Data Repository (see arrow labeled "2."
      in Figure 1 of [I-D.ietf-drinks-usecases-requirements]).


   Client:   An application that supports an SPPP client; it is
      sometimes referred to as a "registry client".


   Registry:   The Registry operates a master database of Session
      Establishment Data for one or more Registrants.

      A Registry acts as an SPPP server.


   Registrant:   In this document we extend the definition of a
      Registrant based on [RFC4725].  The Registrant is the end-user,
      the person or organization that is the "holder" of the Session
      Establishment Data being provisioned into the Registry by a
      Registrar.  For example, in
      [I-D.ietf-drinks-usecases-requirements], a Registrant is pictured
      as a SIP Service Provider in Figure 2.

      Within the confines of a Registry, a Registrant is uniquely
      identified by a well-known ID.

Internet-Draft             draft-drinks-spprov             November 2011


   Registrar:   In this document we extend the definition of a Registrar
      from [RFC4725].  A Registrar is an entity that performs
      provisioning operations on behalf of a Registrant by interacting
      with the Registry via SPPP operations.  In other words the
      Registrar is the SPPP Client.  The Registrar and Registrant roles
      are logically separate to allow, but not require, a single
      Registrar to perform provisioning operations on behalf of more
      than one Registrant.

   Peering Organization:   A Peering Organization is an entity to which
      a Registrant's Route Groups are made visible using the operations
      of SPPP.

3.  Protocol High Level Design

   This section introduces the structure of the data model and provides
   the information framework for the SPPP.  An overview of the protocol
   operations is first provided with a typical deployment scenario.  The
   data model is then defined along with all the objects manipulated by
   the protocol and their relationships.

3.1.  Protocol Data Model

   The data model illustrated and described in Figure 2 defines the
   logical objects and the relationships between these objects that the
   SPPP protocol supports.  SPPP defines the protocol operations through
   which an SPPP client populates a registry with these logical objects.
   Various clients belonging to different registrars may use the
   protocol for populating the registry's data.

   The logical structure presented below is consistent with the
   terminology and requirements defined in
   [I-D.ietf-drinks-usecases-requirements].

   The objects and attributes that comprise the data model can be
   described as follows (objects listed from the bottom up):

   o  Public Identifier:
      From a broad perspective a public identifier is a well-known
      attribute that is used as the key to perform resolution lookups.
      Within the context of SPPP, a public identifier object can be a
      telephone number, a range of telephone numbers, a PSTN Routing
      Number (RN), or a TN prefix.

      An SPPP Public Identifier is associated with a Destination Group
      to create a logical grouping of Public Identifiers that share a
      common set of Routes.

      A TN Public Identifier may optionally be associated with zero or
      more individual Route Records.  This ability for a Public
      Identifier to be directly associated with a set of Route Records
      (e.g. target URI), as opposed to being associated with a
      Destination Group, supports the use cases where the target URI
      contains data specifically tailored to an individual TN Public
      Identifier.

   o  Destination Group:
      A named collection of zero or more Public Identifiers that can be
      associated with one or more Route Groups for the purpose of
      facilitating the management of their common routing information.

   o  Route Group:
      A Route Group contains a set of Route Record references, a set of
      Destination Group references, and a set of peering organization
      identifiers.  This is used to establish a three part relationships
      between a set of Public Identifiers, the routing information (SED)
      shared across the Public Identifiers, and the list of peering
      organizations whose query responses from the resolution system may
      include the routing information from a given route group.  In
      addition, the sourceIdent element within a Route Group, in concert
      with the set of peering organization identifiers, enables fine-
      grained source based routing.  For further details about the Route
      Group and source based routing, refer to the definitions and
      descriptions of the Route Group operations found later in this
      document.

   o  Route Record:
      A Route Record contains the data that a resolution system returns
      in response to a successful query for a Public Identifier.  Route
      Records are generally associated with a Route Group when the SED
      within is not specific to a Public Identifier.
      To support the use cases defined in

      [I-D.ietf-drinks-usecases-requirements], SPPP defines three type
      of Route Records: URIType, NAPTRType, and NSType.  These Route
      Records extend the abstract type RteRecType and inherit the common
      attribute 'priority' that is meant for setting precedence across
      the route records defined within a Route Group in a protocol
      agnostic fashion.

   o  Organization:
      An An Organization is an entity that may fulfill any combination
      of three roles: Registrant, Registrar, and Peering Organization.
      All SPPP objects are associated with two organization identifiers
      to identify each object's registrant and registrar.  A Route Group
      object is also associated with a set of zero or more organization
      identifiers that identify the peering organization(s) whose
      resolution query responses may include the routing information
      (SED) defined in the Route Records within that Route Group.  A
      peering organization is an entity that the registrant intends to
      share the SED data with.

3.2.  Time Value

   Some SPPP request and response messages include time value(s) defined
   as type xs:dateTime, a built-in W3C XML Schema Datatype.  Use of
   unqualified local time value is discouraged as it can lead to
   interoperability issues.  The value of time attribute MUST BE
   expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format without the
   timezone digits.

   "2010-05-30T09:30:10Z" is an example of an acceptable time value for
   use in SPPP messages. "2010-05-30T06:30:10+3:00" is a valid UTC time,
   but it is not approved for use in SPPP messages.

4.  Transport Protocol Requirements

   This section provides requirements for transport protocols suitable
   for SPPP.  More specifically, this section specifies the services,
   features, and assumptions that SPPP delegates to the chosen transport
   and envelope technologies.

4.1.  Connection Oriented

   The SPPP follows a model where a client establishes a connection to a
   server in order to further exchange SPPP messages over such point-to-
   point connection.  A transport protocol for SPPP MUST therefore be
   connection oriented.

4.2.  Request and Response Model

   Provisioning operations in SPPP follow the request-response model,
   where a client sends a request message to initiate a transaction and
   the server responds with a response.  Multiple subsequent request-
   response exchanges MAY be performed over a single persistent
   connection.

   Therefore, a transport protocol for SPPP MUST follow the request-
   response model by allowing a response to be sent to the request
   initiator.

4.3.  Connection Lifetime

   Some use cases involve provisioning a single request to a network
   element.  Connections supporting such provisioning requests might be
   short-lived, and may be established only on demand.  Other use cases
   involve either provisioning a large dataset, or a constant stream of
   small updates, either of which would likely require long-lived
   connections.

   Therefore, a protocol suitable for SPPP SHOULD be able to support
   both short-lived as well as long-lived connections.

4.4.  Authentication

   All SPPP objects are associated with a registrant identifier.  SPPP
   Clients provisions SPPP objects on behalf of registrants.  An
   authenticated SPP Client is a registrar.  Therefore, the SPPP
   transport protocol MUST provide means for an SPPP server to
   authenticate an SPPP Client.

Internet-Draft             draft-drinks-spprov             November 2011


4.5.  Authorization

   After successful authentication of the SPPP client as a registrar the
   registry performs authorization checks to determine if the registrar
   is authorized to act on behalf of the Registrant whose identifier is
   included in the SPPP request.  Refer to the Security Considerations
   section for further guidance.

4.6.  Confidentiality and Integrity

   In some deployments, the SPPP objects that an SPPP registry manages
   can be private in nature.  As a result it MAY NOT be appropriate to
   for transmission in plain text over a connection to the SPPP
   registry.  Therefore, the transport protocol SHOULD provide means for
   end-to-end encryption between the SPPP client and server.

   For some SPPP implementations, it may be acceptable for the data to
   be transmitted in plain text, but the failure to detect a change in
   data after it leaves the SPPP client and before it is received at the
   server, either by accident or with a malicious intent, will adversely
   affect the stability and integrity of the registry.  Therefore, the
   transport protocol SHOULD provide means for data integrity
   protection.

4.7.  Near Real Time

   Many use cases require near real-time responses from the server.
   Therefore, a DRINKS transport protocol MUST support near real-time
   response to requests submitted by the client.

4.8.  Request and Response Sizes

   Use of SPPP may involve simple updates that may consist of small
   number of bytes, such as, update of a single public identifier.
   Other provisioning operations may constitute large number of datasets
   as in adding millions records to a registry.  As a result, a suitable
   transport protocol for SPPP SHOULD accommodate datasets of various
   sizes.

4.9.  Request and Response Correlation

   A transport protocol suitable for SPPP MUST allow responses to be
   correlated with requests.

4.10.  Request Acknowledgement

   Data transported in the SPPP is likely crucial for the operation of
   the communication network that is being provisioned.  A SPPP client

   responsible for provisioning SED to the registry has a need to know
   if the submitted requests have been processed correctly.

   Failed transactions can lead to situations where a subset of public
   identifiers or even SSPs might not be reachable, or the provisioning
   state of the network is inconsistent.

   Therefore, a transport protocol for SPPP MUST provide a response for
   each request, so that a client can identify whether a request
   succeeded or failed.

4.11.  Mandatory Transport

   At the time of this writing, a choice of transport protocol has been
   provided in [I-D.ietf-drinks-sppp-over-soap].  To encourage
   interoperability, the SPPP server MUST provide support for this
   transport protocol.  With time, it is possible that other transport
   layer choices may surface that agree with the requirements discussed
   above.

5.  Base Protocol Data Structures and Response Codes

   SPPP contains some common data structures for most of the supported
   object types.  This section describes these common data structures.

5.1.  Basic Object Type and Organization Identifiers

   This section introduces the basic object type that most first class
   objects derive from.

   All first class objects extend the basic object type BasicObjType
   that contains the identifier of the registrant organization that owns
   this object, the identifier of the registrar organization that
   created this object, the date and time that the object was created by
   the server, and the date and time that the object was last modified.


           <complexType name="BasicObjType" abstract="true">
                   <sequence>
                           <element name="rant" type="spppb:OrgIdType"/>
                           <element name="rar" type="spppb:OrgIdType"/>
                           <element name="cDate" type="dateTime"
                              minOccurs="0"/>
                           <element name="mDate" type="dateTime"
                              minOccurs="0"/>
                           <element name="ext" type="spppb:ExtAnyType"
                              minOccurs="0"/>
                   </sequence>
           </complexType>

   The identifiers used for registrants (rant), registrars (rar), and
   peering organizations (peeringOrg) are instances of OrgIdType.  The
   OrgIdType is defined as a string and all OrgIdType instances SHOULD
   follow the textual convention: "namespace:value" (for example "iana-
   en:32473").  See the IANA Consideration section for more details.

5.2.  Various Object Key Types

5.2.1.  Generic Object Key Type

   The SPPP data model contains some object relationships.  In some
   cases these object relationships are established by embedding the
   unique identity of the related object inside the relating object.  In
   addition, an object's unique identity is required to Delete or Get
   the details of an object.  The abstract type called ObjKeyType is
   where this unique identity is housed.  Because this object key type
   is abstract, it MUST be specified in a concrete form in any
   conforming SPPP "transport" specification.



Mule, et al.              Expires May 18, 2012                 [Page 16]

Internet-Draft             draft-drinks-spprov             November 2011


   Most objects in SPPP are uniquely identified by an object key that
   has the object's name, object's type and its registrant's
   organization ID as its attributes.  Consequently, any concrete
   representation of the ObjKeyType MUST contain the following:

      Object Name: The name of the object.

      Registrant Id: The unique organization ID that identifies the
      Registrant.

      Type: The enumeration vaue that represents the type of SPPP object
      that.  This is required as different types of objects in SPPP,
      that belong to the same registrant, can have the same name.

   The structure of abstract ObjKeyType is as follows:


   <complexType name="ObjKeyType" abstract="true">
           <annotation>
                   <documentation>
                           ---- Generic type that represents the
                           key for various objects in SPPP. ----
                   </documentation>
           </annotation>
   </complexType>

   The object types in SPPP that MUST adhere to this definition of
   generic object key are defined as an enumeration in the XML data
   structure.  The structure of the the enumeration is as follows:

    <simpleType name="ObjKeyTypeEnum">
      <restriction base="token">
        <enumeration value="RteGrp"/>
        <enumeration value="DestGrp"/>
        <enumeration value="RteRec"/>
        <enumeration value="EgrRte"/>
      </restriction>
    </simpleType>

5.2.2.  Derived Object Key Types

   The SPPP data model contains certain objects that are uniquely
   identified by attributes, different from or in addition to, the
   attributes in the generic object key described in previous section.
   These kind of object keys are derived from the abstract ObjKeyType
   and defined in there own abstract key types.  Because these object
   key types are abstract, these MUST be specified in a concrete form in
   any conforming SPPP "transport" specification.  These are used in

Internet-Draft             draft-drinks-spprov             November 2011


   Delete and Get operations, and may also be used in Accept and Reject
   operations.

   Following are the derived object keys in SPPP data model:

   o    RteGrpOfferKeyType: This uniquely identifies a Route Group
        object offer.  This key type extends from ObjKeyType and MUST
        also have the organization ID of the Registrant to whom the
        object is being offered, as one of its attributes.  In addition
        to the Delete and Get operations, these key types are used in
        Accept and Reject operations on a Route Group Offer object.  The
        structure of abstract RteGrpOfferKeyType is as follows:

   <complexType name="RteGrpOfferKeyType"
   abstract="true">
           <complexContent>
                   <extension base="spppb:ObjKeyType">
                           <annotation>
                                   <documentation>
                                   ---- Generic type that represents the
                                   key for a object offer. ----
                                   </documentation>
                           </annotation>
                   </extension>
           </complexContent>
   </complexType>

        A Route Group Offer object MUST use RteGrpOfferKeyType.  Refer
        the "Protocol Data Model Objects" section of this document for
        description of Route Group Offer object.

   o    PubIdKeyType: This uniquely identifies a Public Identity object.
        This key type extends from abstract ObjKeyType.  Any concrete
        defintion of PubIdKeyType MUST contain the elements that
        identify the value and type of Public Identity and also contain
        the organization ID of the Registrant that is the owner of the
        Public Identity object.  A Public Identity object key in SPPP is
        uniquely identified by the the registrant's organization ID, the
        value of the public identity, and, optionally, the Destination
        Group name the public identiy belongs to.  Consequently, any
        concrete representation of the ObjKeyType MUST contain the
        following attributes:

        *    Registrant Id: The unique organization ID that identifies
             the Registrant.

        *    Destination Group name: The name of the Destination Group
             the Public Identity is associated with.  This is an

             optional attribute.

        *    Type: The type of Public Identity.

        *    Value: The value of the Public Identity.

        The .PubIdKeyType is used in Delete and Get operations on a
        Public Identifier object.

   o    The structure of abstract PubIdKeyType is as follows:

           <complexType name="PubIdKeyType" abstract="true">
                   <complexContent>
                           <extension base="spppb:ObjKeyType">
                                   <annotation>
                                           <documentation>
           ---- Generic type that represents
           the key for a Pub Id. ----
                                           </documentation>
                                   </annotation>
                           </extension>
                   </complexContent>
           </complexType>

   A Public Identity object MUST use attributes of PubIdKeyType for its
   unique identification .  Refer the "Protocol Data Model Objects"
   section of this document for a description of Public Identity object.

                          Table 1: Response Types

   When the response messages are "parameterized" with the Attribute
   Name and Attribute Value, then the use of these parameters MUST
   adhere to the following rules:

   o    Any value provided for the Attribute Name parameter MUST be an
        exact XSD element name of the protocol data element that the
        response message is referring to.  For example, valid values for
        "attribute name" are "dgName", "rgName", "rteRec", etc.

   o    The value for Attribute Value MUST be the value of the data
        element to which the preceding Attribute Name refers.

   o    Response type "Attribute value invalid" SHOULD be used whenever
        an element value does not adhere to data validation rules.

   o    Response types "Attribute value invalid" and "Object does not
        exist" MUST NOT be used interchangeably.  Response type "Object
        does not exist" SHOULD be returned by an Add/Del/Accept/Reject
        operation when the data element(s) used to uniquely identify a
        pre-existing object do not exist.  If the data elements used to
        uniquely identify an object are malformed, then response type
        "Attribute value invalid" SHOULD be returned.

6.  Protocol Data Model Objects

   This section provides a description of the specification of each
   supported data model object (the nouns) and identifies the commands
   (the verbs) that MUST be supported for each data model object.
   However, the specification of the data structures necessary to
   support each command is delegated to the "transport" specification.

6.1.  Destination Group

   As described in the introductory sections, a Destination Group
   represents a set of Public Identifiers with common routing
   information.  The transport protocol MUST support the ability to
   Create, Modify, Get, and Delete Destination Groups (refer the
   "Protocol Operations" section of this document for a generic
   description of various operations).

   A Destination Group object MUST be uniquely identified by attributes
   as defined in the description of "ObjKeyType" in the section "Generic
   Object Key Type" of this document.

   The DestGrpType object structure is defined as follows:


     <complexType name="DestGrpType">
       <complexContent>
        <extension base="spppb:BasicObjType">
         <sequence>
            <element name="dgName" type="spppb:ObjNameType"/>
         </sequence>
        </extension>
       </complexContent>
     </complexType>

   The DestGrpType object is composed of the following elements:

   o    base: All first class objects extend BasicObjType that contains
        the ID of the registrant organization that owns this object,
        registrar organization that provisioned this object on behalf of
        the registrant, the date and time that the object was created by
        the server, and the date and time that the object was last
        modified.  If the client passed in either the created date or
        the modification date, the server will ignore them.  The server
        sets these two date/time values.

   o    dgName: The character string that contains the name of the
        Destination Group.

   o    ext: Point of extensibility described in a previous section of
        this document.

6.2.  Public Identifier

   A Public Identifier is the search key used for locating the session
   establishment data (SED).  In many cases, a Public Identifier is
   attributed to the end user who has a retail relationship with the
   service provider or registrant organization.  SPPP supports the
   notion of the carrier-of-record as defined in [RFC5067].  Therefore,
   the registrant under whom the Public Identity is being created can
   optionally claim to be a carrier-of-record.

   SPPP identifies two types of Public Identifiers: telephone numbers
   (TN), and the routing numbers (RN).  SPPP provides structures to
   manage a single TN, a contiguous range of TNs, and a TN prefix.  The
   transport protocol MUST support the ability to Create, Modify, Get,
   and Delete Public Identifiers (refer the "Protocol Operations"
   section of this document for a generic description of various
   operations).

   A Public Identity object MUST be uniquely identified by attributes as
   defined in the description of "PubIdKeyType" in the section "Derived
   Object Key Types" of this document.

   The abstract XML schema type definition PubIDType is a generalization
   for the concrete the Public Identifier schema types.  PubIDType
   element 'dgName' represents the name of the destination group that a
   given Public Identifier MAY be a member of.  The PubIDType object
   structure is defined as follows:


     <complexType name="PubIdType" abstract="true">
       <complexContent>
        <extension base="spppb:BasicObjType">
          <sequence>
            <element name="dgName" type="spppb:ObjNameType"
               minOccurs="0"/>
          </sequence>
        </extension>
       </complexContent>
     </complexType>

   A Public Identifier may be provisioned as a member of a Destination
   Group or provisioned outside of a Destination Group.  A Public
   Identifier that is provisioned as a member of a Destination Group is
   intended to be associated with its SED through the Route Group(s)
   that are associated with its containing Destination Group.  A Public

   Identifier that is not provisioned as a member of a Destination Group
   is intended to be associated with its SED through the Route Records
   that are directly associated with the Public Identifier.

   A telephone number is provisioned using the TNType, an extension of
   PubIDType.  When a Public Identifier is provisioned as a member of a
   Destination Group, each TNType object is uniquely identified by the
   combination of its value contained within <tn> element, and the
   unique key of its parent Destination Group (dgName and rantId).  In
   other words a given telephone number string may exist within one or
   more Destination Groups, but must not exist more than once within a
   Destination Group.  A Public Identifier that is not provisioned as a
   member of a Destination Group is uniquely identified by the
   combination of its value, and its registrant ID.  TNType is defined
   as follows:


    <complexType name="TNType">
     <complexContent>
      <extension base="spppb:PubIdType">
       <sequence>
        <element name="tn"
        type="spppb:NumberValType"/>
        <element name="corInfo"
        type="spppb:CORInfoType" minOccurs="0"/>
        <element name="rrRef"
        type="spppb:RteRecRefType"
        minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
       </sequence>
      </extension>
     </complexContent>
    </complexType>

   <simpleType name="NumberValType">
           <restriction base="token">
                   <maxLength value="20"/>
                   <pattern value="\+?\d\d*"/>
           </restriction>
   </simpleType>


   TNType consists of the following attributes:

   o    tn: Telephone number to be added to the registry.

   o    rrRef: Optional reference to route records that are directly
        associated with the TN Public Identifier.  Following the SPPP
        data model, the route record could be a protocol agnostic

        URIType or another type.

   o    corInfo: corInfo is an optional parameter of type CORInfoType
        that allows the registrant organization to set forth a claim to
        be the carrier-of-record (see [RFC5067]).  This is done by
        setting the value of <corClaim> element of the CORInfoType
        object structure to "true".  The other two parameters of the
        CORInfoType, <cor> and <corDate> are set by the registry to
        describe the outcome of the carrier-of-record claim by the
        registrant.  In general, inclusion of <corInfo> parameter is
        useful if the registry has the authority information, such as,
        the number portability data, etc., in order to qualify whether
        the registrant claim can be satisfied.  If the carrier-of-record
        claim disagrees with the authority data in the registry, whether
        the TN add operation fails or not is a matter of policy and it
        is beyond the scope of this document.

   A routing number is provisioned using the RNType, an extension of
   PubIDType.  SSPs that possess the number portability data may be able
   to leverage the RN search key to discover the ingress routes for
   session establishment.  Therefore, the registrant organization can
   add the RN and associate it with the appropriate destination group to
   share the route information.  Each RNType object is uniquely
   identified by the combination of its value inside the <rn> element,
   and the unique key of its parent Destination Group (dgName and
   rantId).  In other words a given routing number string may exist
   within one or more Destination Groups, but must not exist more than
   once within a Destination Group.  RNType is defined as follows:


    <complexType name="RNType">
     <complexContent>
      <extension base="spppb:PubIdType">
       <sequence>
        <element name="rn"
        type="spppb:NumberValType"/>
        <element name="corInfo"
        type="spppb:CORInfoType" minOccurs="0"/>
       </sequence>
      </extension>
     </complexContent>
    </complexType>

   RNType has the following attributes:

   o    rn: Routing Number used as the search key.

   o    corInfo: Optional <corInfo> element of type CORInfoType.

   TNRType structure is used to provision a contiguous range of
   telephone numbers.  The object definition requires a starting TN and
   an ending TN that together define the span of the TN range.  Use of
   TNRType is particularly useful when expressing a TN range that does
   not include all the TNs within a TN block or prefix.  The TNRType
   definition accommodates the open number plan as well such that the
   TNs that fall between the start and end TN range may include TNs with
   different length variance.  Whether the registry can accommodate the
   open number plan semantics is a matter of policy and is beyond the
   scope of this document.  Each TNRType object is uniquely identified
   by the combination of its value that in turn is a combination of the
   <startTn> and <endTn> elements, and the unique key of its parent
   Destination Group (dgName and rantId).  In other words a given TN
   Range may exist within one or more Destination Groups, but must not
   exist more than once within a Destination Group.  TNRType object
   structure definition is as follows:


    <complexType name="TNRType">
     <complexContent>
      <extension base="spppb:PubIdType">
       <sequence>
        <element name="range" type="spppb:NumberRangeType"/>
        <element name="corInfo" type="spppb:CORInfoType" minOccurs="0"/>
       </sequence>
      </extension>
     </complexContent>
    </complexType>

     <complexType name="NumberRangeType">
      <sequence>
       <element name="startTn" type="spppb:NumberValType"/>
       <element name="endTn" type="spppb:NumberValType"/>
      </sequence>
     </complexType>

   TNRType has the following attributes:

   o    startTn: Starting TN in the TN range

   o    endTn: The last TN in the TN range

   o    corInfo: Optional <corInfo> element of type CORInfoType

   In some cases, it is useful to describe a set of TNs with the help of
   the first few digits of the telephone number, also referred to as the

   telephone number prefix or a block.  A given TN prefix may include
   TNs with different length variance in support of open number plan.
   Once again, whether the registry supports the open number plan
   semantics is a matter of policy and it is beyond the scope of this
   document.  The TNPType data structure is used to provision a TN
   prefix.  Each TNPType object is uniquely identified by the
   combination of its value in the <tnPrefix> element, and the unique
   key of its parent Destination Group (dgName and rantId).  TNPType is
   defined as follows:


    <complexType name="TNPType">
     <complexContent>
      <extension base="spppb:PubIdType">
       <sequence>
        <element name="tnPrefix"
        type="spppb:NumberValType"/>
        <element name="corInfo"
        type="spppb:CORInfoType" minOccurs="0"/>
       </sequence>
      </extension>
     </complexContent>
    </complexType>

   TNPType consists of the following attributes:

   o    tnPrefix: The telephone number prefix

   o    corInfo: Optional <corInfo> element of type CORInfoType.

6.3.  Route Group

   As described in the introductory sections, a Route Group represents a
   combined grouping of Route Records that define route information,
   Destination Groups that contain a set of Public Identifiers with
   common routing information, and the list of peer organizations that
   have access to these public identifiers using this route information.
   It is this indirect linking of public identifiers to their route
   information that significantly improves the scalability and
   manageability of the peering data.  Additions and changes to routing
   information are reduced to a single operation on a Route Group or
   Route Record , rather than millions of data updates to individual
   public identifier records that individually contain their peering
   data.  The transport protocol MUST support the ability to Create,
   Modify, Get, and Delete Route Groups (refer the "Protocol Operations"
   section of this document for a generic description of various
   operations).

   A Route Group object MUST be uniquely identified by attributes as
   defined in the description of "ObjKeyType" in the section "Generic
   Object Key Type" of this document.

   The RteGrpType object structure is defined as follows:


   <complexType name="RteGrpType">
     <complexContent>
           <extension base="spppb:BasicObjType">
             <sequence>
                   <element name="rgName" type="spppb:ObjNameType"/>
                   <element name="rrRef" type="spppb:RteRecRefType"
                     minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
                   <element name="dgName" type="spppb:ObjNameType"
                      minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
                   <element name="peeringOrg" type="spppb:OrgIdType"

                   <element name="sourceIdent"
                      type="spppb:SourceIdentType"
                      minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
                   <element name="isInSvc" type="boolean"/>
                   <element name="priority" type="unsignedShort"/>
                   <element name="ext" type="spppb:ExtAnyType"
                      minOccurs="0"/>
                   </sequence>
            </extension>
     </complexContent>
   </complexType>

    <complexType name="RteRecRefType">
      <sequence>
        <element name="rrKey" type="spppb:ObjKeyType"/>
        <element name="priority" type="unsignedShort"/>
        <element name="ext" type="spppb:ExtAnyType"
           minOccurs="0"/>
      </sequence>
    </complexType>

   The RteGrpType object is composed of the following elements:

   o    base: All first class objects extend BasicObjType that contains
        the ID of the registrant organization that owns this object, the
        date and time that the object was created by the server, and the
        date and time that the object was last modified.  If the client
        passes in either the created date or the modification date, the
        server will ignore them.  The server sets these two date/time
        values.

   o    rgName: The character string that contains the name of the Route
        Group.  It uniquely identifies this object within the context of
        the registrant ID (a child element of the base element as
        described above).

   o    rrRef: Set of zero or more objects of type RteRecRefType that
        house the unique keys of the Route Records that the RteGrpType
        object refers to and their relative priority within the context
        of a given route group.  The associated Route Records contain
        the routing information, sometimes called SED, associated with
        this Route Group.

   o    dgName: Set of zero or more names of DestGrpType object
        instances.  Each dgName name, in association with this Route
        Group's registrant ID, uniquely identifies a DestGrpType object
        instance whose public identifiers are reachable using the
        routing information housed in this Route Group.  An intended
        side affect of this is that a Route Group cannot provide routing
        information for a Destination Group belonging to another
        registrant.

   o    peeringOrg: Set of zero or more peering organization IDs that
        have accepted an offer to receive this Route Group's
        information.  The set of peering organizations in this list is
        not directly settable or modifiable using the addRteGrpsRqst
        operation.  This set is instead controlled using the route offer
        and accept operations.

   o    sourceIdent: Set of zero or more SourceIdentType object
        instances.  These objects, described further below, house the
        source identification schemes and identifiers that are applied
        at resolution time as part of source based routing algorithms
        for the Route Group.

   o    isInSvc: A boolean element that defines whether this Route Group
        is in service.  The routing information contained in a Route
        Group that is in service is a candidate for inclusion in
        resolution responses for public identities residing in the
        Destination Group associated with this Route Group.  The routing
        information contained in a Route Group that is not in service is
        not a candidate for inclusion in resolution responses.

   o    priority: Zero or one priority value that can be used to provide
        a relative value weighting of one Route Group over another.  The
        manner in which this value is used, perhaps in conjunction with
        other factors, is a matter of policy.

   o    ext: Point of extensibility described in a previous section of
        this document.

   As described above, the Route Group contains a set of references to
   route record objects.  A route record object is based on an abstract
   type: RteRecType.  The concrete types that use RteRecType as an
   extension base are NAPTRType, NSType, and URIType.  The definitions
   of these types are included the Route Record section of this
   document.

   The RteGrpType object provides support for source-based routing via
   the peeringOrg data element and more granular source base routing via
   the source identity element.  The source identity element provides
   the ability to specify zero or more of the following in association
   with a given Route Group: a regular expression that is matched
   against the resolution client IP address, a regular expression that
   is matched against the root domain name(s), and/or a regular
   expression that is matched against the calling party URI(s).  The
   result will be that, after identifying the visible Route Groups whose
   associated Destination Group(s) contain the lookup key being queried
   and whose peeringOrg list contains the querying organizations
   organization ID, the resolution server will evaluate the
   characteristics of the Source URI, and Source IP address, and root
   domain of the lookup key being queried.  The resolution server then
   compares these criteria against the source identity criteria
   associated with the Route Groups.  The routing information contained
   in Route Groups that have source based routing criteria will only be
   included in the resolution response if one or more of the criteria
   matches the source criteria from the resolution request.  The Source
   Identity data element is of type SourceIdentType, whose structure is
   defined as follows:

6.4.  Route Record

   As described in the introductory sections, a Route Group represents a
   combined grouping of Route Records that define route information.
   However, Route Records need not be created to just serve a single
   Route Group.  Route Records can be created and managed to serve
   multiple Route Groups.  As a result, a change to the properties of a
   network node used for multiple routes, would necessitate just a
   single update operation to change the properties of that node.  The
   change would then be reflected in all the Route Groups whose route
   record set contains a reference to that node.  The transport protocol
   MUST support the ability to Create, Modify, Get, and Delete Route
   Records (refer the "Protocol Operations" section of this document for
   a generic description of various operations).

   A Route Record object MUST be uniquely identified by attributes as

   defined in the description of "ObjKeyType" in the section "Generic
   Object Key Type" of this document.

   The RteRecType object structure is defined as follows:


   <complexType name="RteRecType" abstract="true">
     <complexContent>
           <extension base="spppb:BasicObjType">
             <sequence>

                   <element name="priority" type="unsignedShort"
                      minOccurs="0"/>
             </sequence>
       </extension>
     </complexContent>
   </complexType>

   The RteRecType object is composed of the following elements:

   o    base: All first class objects extend BasicObjType that contains
        the ID of the registrant organization that owns this object, the
        date and time that the object was created by the server, and the
        date and time that the object was last modified.  If the client
        passes in either the created date or the modification date, the
        server will ignore them.  The server sets these two date/time
        values.

   o    rrName: The character string that contains the name of the Route
        Record.  It uniquely identifies this object within the context
        of the registrant ID (a child element of the base element as
        described above).

   o    priority: Zero or one priority value that can be used to provide
        a relative value weighting of one Route Record over another.
        The manner in which this value is used, perhaps in conjunction
        with other factors, is a matter of policy.

   As described above, route records are based on an abstract type:
   RteRecType.  The concrete types that use RteRecType as an extension
   base are NAPTRType, NSType, and URIType.  The definitions of these
   types are included below.  The NAPTRType object is comprised of the
   data elements necessary for a NAPTR that contains routing information
   for a Route Group.  The NSType object is comprised of the data
   elements necessary for a DNS name server that points to another DNS
   server that contains the desired routing information.  The NSType is
   relevant only when the resolution protocol is ENUM.  The URIType
   object is comprised of the data elements necessary to house a URI.

   The data provisioned in a registry can be leveraged for many purposes
   and queried using various protocols including SIP, ENUM and others.
   It is for this reason that a route record type offers a choice of URI
   and DNS resource record types.  URIType fulfills the need for both
   SIP and ENUM protocols.  When a given URIType is associated to a
   destination group, the user part of the replacement string <uri> that
   may require the Public Identifier cannot be preset.  As a SIP
   Redirect, the resolution server will apply <ere> pattern on the input
   Public Identifier in the query and process the replacement string by
   substituting any back reference(s) in the <uri> to arrive at the
   final URI that is returned in the SIP Contact header.  For an ENUM
   query, the resolution server will simply return the value of the
   <ere> and <uri> members of the URIType in the NAPTR REGEX parameter.

   o    svcs: ENUM service(s) that are served by the SBE.  This field's
        value must be of the form specified in [RFC6116] (e.g., E2U+
        pstn:sip+sip).  The allowable values are a matter of policy and
        not limited by this protocol.

   o    regx: NAPTR's regular expression field.  If this is not included
        then the Repl field must be included.

   o    repl: NAPTR replacement field, should only be provided if the
        Regex field is not provided, otherwise the server will ignore it

   o    ttl: Number of seconds that an addressing server may cache this
        NAPTR.

   o    ipAddr: Zero or more objects of type IpAddrType.  Each object
        holds an IP Address and the IP Address type, IPv4 or IP v6.

        [RFC3986].

   o    uri: the URI as defined in [RFC3986].  In some cases, this will
        serve as the replacement string and it will be left to the
        resolution server to arrive at the final usable URI.

6.5.  Route Group Offer

   The list of peer organizations whose resolution responses can include
   the routing information contained in a given Route Group is
   controlled by the organization to which a Route Group object belongs
   (its registrant), and the peer organization that submits resolution
   requests (a data recipient, also know as a peering organization).
   The registrant offers access to a Route Group by submitting a Route
   Group Offer.  The data recipient can then accept or reject that

   offer.  Not until access to a Route Group has been offered and
   accepted will the data recipient's organization ID be included in the
   peeringOrg list in a Route Group object, and that Route Group's
   peering information become a candidate for inclusion in the responses
   to the resolution requests submitted by that data recipient.  The
   transport protocol MUST support the ability to Create, Modify, Get,
   Delete, Accept and Reject Route Group Offers (refer the "Protocol

        "offered" when ever a new Route Group Offer is added, and is
        automatically set to "accepted" if and when that offer is
        accepted.  The value of the element is ignored when passed in by
        the client.

   o    offerDateTime: Date and time in UTC when the Route Group Offer
        was added.

   o    acceptDateTime: Date and time in UTC when the Route Group Offer
        was accepted.

6.6.  Egress Route

   In a high-availability environment, the originating SSP likely has
   more than one egress paths to the ingress SBE of the target SSP.  If
   the originating SSP wants to exercise greater control and choose a
   specific egress SBE to be associated to the target ingress SBE, it
   can do so using the EgrRteType object.

   A Egress Route object MUST be uniquely identified by attributes as
   defined in the description of "ObjKeyType" in the section "Generic
   Object Key Type" of this document.

   Lets assume that the target SSP has offered to share one or more
   ingress route information and that the originating SSP has accepted
   the offer.  In order to add the egress route to the registry, the
   originating SSP uses a valid regular expression to rewrite ingress
   route in order to include the egress SBE information.  Also, more
   than one egress route can be associated with a given ingress route in
   support of fault-tolerant configurations.  The supporting SPPP
   structure provides a way to include route precedence information to
   help manage traffic to more than one outbound egress SBE.

   The transport protocol MUST support the ability to Add, Modify, Get,
   and Delete Egress Routes (refer the "Protocol Operations" section of
   this document for a generic description of various operations).  The
   EgrRteType object structure is defined as follows:

7.  Protocol Operations

7.1.  Add Operation

   Any conforming "transport" specification MUST provide a definition
   for the operation that adds one or more SPPP objects into the
   registry.  If the object, as identified by the request attributes
   that form part of the object's key, does not exist, then the registry
   MUST create the object.  If the object does exist, then the registry
   MUST replace the current properties of the object with the properties
   passed in as part of the Add operation.

   If the entity that issued the command is not authorized to perform
   this operation an appropriate error message MUST be returned from
   amongst the response messages defined in "Response Message Types"
   section of the document.

7.2.  Delete Operation

   Any conforming "transport" specification MUST provide a definition
   for the operation that deletes one or more SPPP objects from the
   registry using the object's key.

   If the entity that issued the command is not authorized to perform
   this operation an appropriate error message MUST be returned from
   amongst the response messages defined in "Response Message Types"
   section of the document.

   When an object is deleted, any references to that object must of
   course also be removed as the SPPP server implementation fulfills the
   deletion request.  Furthermore, the deletion of a composite object
   must also result in the deletion of the objects it contains.  As a
   result, the following rules apply to the deletion of SPPP object
   types:

   o    Destination Groups: When a destination group is deleted all
        public identifiers within that destination group must also be
        automatically deleted by the SPPP implementation as part of
        fulfilling the deletion request.  And any references between
        that destination group and any route group must be automatically
        removed by the SPPP implementation as part of fulfilling the
        deletion request.

   o    Route Groups: When a route group is deleted any references
        between that route group and any destination group must be
        automatically removed by the SPPP implementation as part of
        fulfilling the deletion request.  Similarly any references
        between that route group and any route records must be removed

        by the SPPP implementation as part of fulfilling the deletion
        request.  Furthermore, route group offers relating that route
        group must also be deleted as part of fulfilling the deletion
        request.

   o    Route Records: When a route record is deleted any references
        between that route record and any route group must be removed by
        the SPPP implementation as part of fulfilling the deletion
        request.

   o    Public Identifiers: When a public identifier is deleted any
        references between that public identifier and its containing
        destination group must be removed by the SPPP implementation as
        part of fulfilling the deletion request.  And any route records
        contained directly within that Public Identifier must be deleted
        by the SPPP implementation as part of fulfilling the deletion
        request.

7.3.  Get Operations

   At times, on behalf of the registrant, the registrar may need to have
   access to SPPP objects that were previously provisioned in the
   registry.  A few examples include logging, auditing, and pre-
   provisioning dependency checking.  This query mechanism is limited to
   aid provisioning scenarios and should not be confused with query
   protocols provided as part of the resolution system (e.g.  ENUM and
   SIP).  Any conforming "transport" specification MUST provide a
   definition for the operation that queries the details of one or more
   SPPP objects from the registry using the object's key.  If the entity
   that issued the command is not authorized to perform this operation
   an appropriate error message MUST be returned from amongst the
   response messages defined in "Response Message Types" section of the
   document.

7.4.  Accept Operations

   In SPPP, a Route Group Offer can be accepted or rejected by, or on
   behalf of, the registrant to whom the Route Group has been offered
   (refer "Protocol Data Model Objects" section of this document for a
   description of the Route Group Offer object).  The Accept operation
   is used to accept the Route Group Offers.  Any conforming "transport"
   specification MUST provide a definition for the operation to accept
   Route Group Offers by, or on behalf of the Registrant, using the
   Route Group Offer object key.

   Not until access to a Route Group has been offered and accepted will
   the registrant's organization ID be included in the peeringOrg list
   in that Route Group object, and that Route Group's peering

   information become a candidate for inclusion in the responses to the
   resolution requests submitted by that registrant.  A Route Group
   Offer that is in the "offered" status is accepted by, or on behalf
   of, the registrant to which it has been offered.  When the Route
   Group Offer is accepted the the Route Group Offer is moved to the
   "accepted" status and adds that data recipient's organization ID into
   the list of peerOrgIds for that Route Group.

   If the entity that issued the command is not authorized to perform
   this operation an appropriate error message MUST be returned from
   amongst the response messages defined in "Response Message Types"
   section of the document.

7.5.  Reject Operations

   In SPPP, a Route Group Offer object can be accepted or rejected by,
   or on behalf of, the registrant to whom the Route Group has been
   offered (refer "Protocol Data Model Objects" section of this document
   for a description of the Route Group Offer object).  Furthermore,
   that offer may be rejected, regardless of whether or not it has been
   previously accepted.  The Reject operation is used to reject the
   Route Group Offers.  When the Route Group Offer is rejected that
   Route Group Offer is deleted, and, if appropriate, the data
   recipient's organization ID is removed from the list of peeringOrg
   IDs for that Route Group.  Any conforming "transport" specification
   MUST provide a definition for the operation to reject Route Group
   Offers by, or on behalf of the Registrant, using the Route Group
   Offer object key.

   If the entity that issued the command is not authorized to perform
   this operation an appropriate error message MUST be returned from
   amongst the response messages defined in "Response Message Types"
   section of the document.

7.6.  Get Server Details Operation

   In SPPP, Get Server Details operation can be used to request certain
   details about the SPPP server that include the SPPP server's current
   status, the major/minor version of the SPPP protocol supported by the
   SPPP server..

   Any conforming "transport" specification MUST provide a definition
   for the operation to request such details from the SPPP server.  If
   the entity that issued the command is not authorized to perform this
   operation an appropriate error message MUST be returned from amongst
   the response messages defined in "Response Message Types" section of
   the document.

8.  XML Considerations

   XML serves as the encoding format for SPPP, allowing complex
   hierarchical data to be expressed in a text format that can be read,
   saved, and manipulated with both traditional text tools and tools
   specific to XML.

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented to develop a conforming implementation.

   This section discusses a small number of XML-related considerations
   pertaining to SPPP.

8.1.  Namespaces

   All SPPP elements are defined in the namespaces in the IANA
   Considerations section and in the Formal Protocol Specification
   section of this document.

8.2.  Versioning and Character Encoding

   All XML instances SHOULD begin with an <?xml?> declaration to
   identify the version of XML that is being used, optionally identify
   use of the character encoding used, and optionally provide a hint to
   an XML parser that an external schema file is needed to validate the
   XML instance.

   Conformant XML parsers recognize both UTF-8 (defined in [RFC3629])
   and UTF-16 (defined in [RFC2781]); per [RFC2277] UTF-8 is the
   RECOMMENDED character encoding for use with SPPP.

   Character encodings other than UTF-8 and UTF-16 are allowed by XML.
   UTF-8 is the default encoding assumed by XML in the absence of an
   "encoding" attribute or a byte order mark (BOM); thus, the "encoding"
   attribute in the XML declaration is OPTIONAL if UTF-8 encoding is
   used.  SPPP clients and servers MUST accept a UTF-8 BOM if present,
   though emitting a UTF-8 BOM is NOT RECOMMENDED.

   Example XML declarations:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>

9.  Security Considerations

   Many SPPP implementations manage data that is considered confidential
   and critical.  Furthermore, SPPP implementations can support
   provisioning activities for multiple registrars and registrants.  As
   a result any SPPP implementation must address the requirements for
   confidentiality, authentication, and authorization.

   With respect to confidentiality and authentication, the transport
   protocol requirements section of this document contains security
   properties that the transport protocol must provide so that
   authenticated endpoints can exchange data confidentially and with
   integrity protection.  Refer to that section and the resulting
   transport protocol specification document for the specific solutions
   to authentication and confidentiality.

   With respect to authorization, the SPPP server implementation must
   define and implement a set of authorization rules that precisely
   address (1) which registrars will be authorized to create/modify/
   delete each SPPP object type for given registrant(s) and (2) which
   registrars will be authorized to view/get each SPPP object type for
   given registrant(s).  These authorization rules are a matter of
   policy and are not specified within the context of SPPP.  However,
   any SPPP implementation must specify these authorization rules in
   order to function in a reliable and safe manner.

   In some situations, it may be required to protect against denial of
   involvement (see [RFC4949]) and tackle non-repudiation concerns in
   regards to SPPP messages.  This type of protection is useful to
   satisfy authenticity concerns related to SPPP messages beyond the
   end-to-end connection integrity, confidentiality, and authentication
   protection that the transport layer provides.  This is an optional
   feature and some SPPP implementations MAY provide support for it.

   It is not uncommon for the logging systems to document on-the-wire
   messages for various purposes, such as, debug, audit, and tracking.
   At the minimum, the various support and administration staff will
   have access to these logs.  Also, if an unprivileged user gains
   access to the SPPP deployments and/or support systems, it will have
   access to the information that is potentially deemed confidential.
   To manage information disclosure concerns beyond the transport level,
   SPPP implementations MAY provide support for encryption at the SPPP
   object level.

   Anti-replay protection ensures that a given SPPP object replayed at a
   later time doesn't affect the integrity of the system.  SPPP provides
   at least one mechanism to fight against replay attacks.  Use of the
   optional client transaction identifier allows the SPPP client to



Mule, et al.              Expires May 18, 2012                 [Page 44]

   correlate the request message with the response and to be sure that
   it is not a replay of a server response from earlier exchanges.  Use
   of unique values for the client transaction identifier is highly
   encouraged to avoid chance matches to a potential replay message.

   The SPPP client or registrar can be a separate entity acting on
   behalf of the registrant in facilitating provisioning transactions to
   the registry.  Further, the transport layer provides end-to-end
   connection protection between SPPP client and the SPPP server.
   Therefore, man-in-the-middle attack is a possibility that may affect
   the integrity of the data that belongs to the registrant and/or
   expose peer data to unintended actors in case well-established
   peering relationships already exist.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemas
   conforming to a registry mechanism described in [RFC3688].

   Two URI assignments are requested.

   Registration request for the SPPP XML namespace:
   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:sppp:base:1
   Registrant Contact: IESG
   XML: None.  Namespace URIs do not represent an XML specification.

   Registration request for the XML schema:
   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:sppp:1
   Registrant Contact: IESG
   XML: See the "Formal Specification" section of this document
   (Section 11).

   IANA is requested to create a new SPPP registry for Organization
   Identifiers that will indicate valid strings to be used for well-
   known enterprise namespaces.
   This document makes the following assignments for the OrgIdType
   namespaces:


         Namespace                    OrgIdType namespace string
