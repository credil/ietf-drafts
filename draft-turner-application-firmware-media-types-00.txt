Internet-Draft     Media Types for Firmware Packages      April 30, 2013


1. Introduction

   [RFC4108] defined three CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax) [RFC5652]
   content types for servers to distribute Firmware packages as well as
   clients to return receipts and errors.     Three media types are
   defined in this document to support the transfer of firmware
   packages, firmware package receipts, and firmware package errors.

   Firmware packages, firmware package receipts, and firmware package
   errors are always encapsulated within ContentInfo structures
   [RFC4108].  Firmware packages are additionally encapsulated within a
   SignedData structure [RFC4108].  Firmware package receipts and errors
   can be digitally signed and to indicate this option an optional
   parameters is defined: protection=signed.

1.1. Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. Media Type Registration Applications

2.1.  Firmware Package Receipt

   This section provides the media type registration application for the
   application/firmware-receipt media type (see [RFC6838], Section 5.6).

     Type name: application

     Subtype name: firmware

     Required parameters: None

     Optional parameters: None

     Encoding considerations: binary.

     Security considerations: See [RFC4108].

     Interoperability considerations: See [RFC4108].

     Published specification: RFC 4108 and this specification.

     Applications which use this media type:

       Applications that support Firmware Package Receipts [RFC4108].

2.2.  Firmware Package Receipt

     This section provides the media type registration application for
     the application/firmware-receipt media type (see [RFC6838], Section
     5.6).
