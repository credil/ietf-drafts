1.  Introduction

   Successive TLS [RFC5246] versions have added support for more cipher
   suites and, over time, more TLS extensions have been defined.  This
   has caused the size of the TLS ClientHello to grow and the additional
   size has caused some implementation bugs to come to light.  At least
   one of these implementation bugs can be ameliorated by making the
   ClientHello even larger.

   This memo describes a TLS extension that can be used to pad a
   ClientHello to a desired size in order to avoid implementation bugs
   caused by certain ClientHello sizes.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Padding Extension

   A new extension type (""padding(TBD)"") is defined and MAY be
   included by the client in its ClientHello message.
   enum {
           padding(TBD), (65535)
   } ExtensionType

   The client MUST fill the padding extension completely with zero
   bytes, although the padding extension may be empty.

   The server MUST NOT echo the extension.

4.  Example usage

   As an example, consider a client that wishes to avoid sending a
   ClientHello with a record size between 256 and 511 bytes (inclusive).
   This case is considered because at least one TLS implementation is
   known to hang the connection when such a ClientHello record is
   received.

   After building a ClientHello as normal, the client can add four to
   the length (to account for the handshake protocol overhead) and test
   whether the resulting length falls into that range.  If it does, a
   padding extension can be added in order to push the length to (at
   least) 512 bytes.

   Note that if the original ClientHello size was between 505 and 508
   bytes then, with the handshake overhead, the record would be between
   509 and 511 bytes long.  Since it's not possible for an extension to
   take less than four bytes of space, the additional padding would have
   to expand the ClientHello record past 512 bytes in these cases.

5.  Security Considerations

   The contents of the padding extension could be used as a side-
   channel.  In order to prevent this, the contents are required to be
   all zeros, although the length of the extension can still be used as
   a much smaller side-channel.  Servers MAY verify that the extension
   is either empty or contains only zero bytes, in order to enforce
   this.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an extension value for the padding
   extension from its ExtensionType registry.
