Internet-Draft     IPv4/IPv6 Multicast Prefixes Option        March 2012


1.  Introduction

   Several solutions (e.g., [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast]) are
   proposed for the delivery of multicast services in the context of
   transition to IPv6.  Even if these solutions may have different
   applicable use cases, they all use specific IPv6 addresses to embed
   IPv4 addresses, for both multicast group
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format], and multicast source
   addresses [RFC6052].

   This document defines a DHCPv6 option [RFC3315] to convey the IPv6
   prefixes to be used for constructing these IPv4-embedded IPv6
   addresses.

   This option can be in particular used in the context of DS-Lite
   [RFC6333], Stateless A+P [RFC6346] and other IPv4-IPv6 transition
   techniques.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   o  IPv4-embedded IPv6 address: is an IPv6 address which embeds a 32
      bit-encoded IPv4 address [RFC6052].  An IPv4-embedded IPv6 address
      can be a unicast or a multicast address.
   o  PREFIX64: is a dedicated IPv6 prefix for building IPv4-embedded
      IPv6 addresses.  A PREFIX64 can be of unicast or multicast.
   o  ASM_PREFIX64: denotes a multicast PREFIX64 which belongs to the
      ASM range (Section 3
      [I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format]).
   o  SSM_PREFIX64: denotes a multicast PREFIX64 which belongs to the
      SSM range (Section 4
      [I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format]).
   o  U_PREFIX64: denotes a unicast PREFIX64 for building the IPv4-
      embedded IPv6 addresses of multicast sources in SSM mode.


3.  PREFIX64 DHCPv6 Option

   OPTION_PREFIX64 (Figure 1) conveys the IPv6 prefix(es) to be used
   (e.g., by a mB4 [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast]) to synthesize

                Figure 1: DHCPv6 Option Format for PREFIX64

   The fields of the option shown in Figure 1 are as follows:

   option-code:  OPTION_PREFIX64 (see Section 8).
   option-length:  39 octets.
   asm-length:  the length for the ASM IPv4-emebdded IPv6 prefix in
      bits.  If the field is set to 0, all bits of ASM_PREFIX64 field
      MUST be set to zeros.
   ASM_PREFIX64:  this field identifies the IPv6 multicast prefix to be
      used to synthesize the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses of the
      multicast groups.  The conveyed multicast IPv6 prefix MUST belong
      to the ASM range defined in
      [I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format] (i.e., ffxx:
      8000/17).
   ssm-length:  the length for the SSM IPv4-emebdded IPv6 prefix in
      bits.  If the field is set to 0, all bits of SSM_PREFIX64 field
      MUST be set to zeros.
   SSM_PREFIX64:  this field identifies the IPv6 multicast prefix to be
      used to synthesize the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses of the
      multicast groups.  The conveyed multicast IPv6 prefix MUST belong
      to the SSM range defined in
      [I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format] (i.e., ff3x:0:
      8000/33).
   unicast-length:  the length for the unicast IPv4-emebdded IPv6 prefix
      in bits.  If the field is set to 0, all bits of U_PREFIX64 field
      MUST be set to zeros.

   U_PREFIX64:  this field identifies the IPv6 unicast prefix to be used
      in SSM mode for constructing the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses of
      the multicast sources.  It may also used to extract the IPv4
      address from the received multicast data flows.  The address
      mapping MUST follow the guidelines documented in [RFC6052].


4.  Configuration Guidelines (Server Side)

   DHCP servers supporting OPTION_PREFIX64 should be configured with
   U_PREFIX64 and at least one ASM_PREFIX64 or one SSM_PREFIX64.

   Both ASM_PREFIX64 and SSM_PREFIX64 MAY be configured and therefore be
   returned to a requesting DHCP client; it is deployment-specific.  In
   particular, if both SSM and ASM modes are supported, ASM_PREFIX64 and
   SSM_PREFIX64 prefixes must be configured.  For SSM deployments, both
   SSM_PREFIX64 and U_PREFIX64 should be configured.


5.  DHCPv6 Client Behaviour

   To retrieve the IPv6 prefixes that will be used to synthesize unicast
   and multicast IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses, the DHCPv6 client MUST
   include OPTION_PREFIX64 in its OPTION_ORO.  If the DHCPv6 client
   receives more than one OPTION_PREFIX64 option from the DHCPv6 server:
   o  If all the enclosed IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast prefixes have the
      same scope, the first instance of the option MUST be used.
   o  If each enclosed IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast prefix has a
      distinct scope, the client MUST select the appropriate IPv4-
      embedded IPv6 multicast prefix having a scope matching the IPv4
      multicast address used to synthesize an IPv4-embedded IPv6
      multicast address.

   If asm-length, ssm-length and unicast-length fields are all set to 0,
   the DHCPv6 client MUST behave as if OPTION_PREFIX64 had not been
   received in the response received from the DHCPv6 server.

   If the asm-length field is non-null, the IPv6 prefix identified by
   ASM_PREFIX64 is used to synthesize IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast
   addresses in the ASM range as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format].

   If the ssm-length field is non-null, the IPv6 prefix identified by
   SSM_PREFIX64 is used to synthesize IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast
   addresses in the SSM range as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format].

   If the unicast-length field is non-null, the IPv6 prefix identified

   by U_PREFIX64 field is used to synthesize IPv4-embedded IPv6 unicast
   addresses as specified in [RFC6052].


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations documented in [RFC3315] and [RFC6052] are
   to be considered.
