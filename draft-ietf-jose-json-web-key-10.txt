1.  Introduction

   A JSON Web Key (JWK) is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC4627]
   data structure that represents a cryptographic key.  This
   specification also defines a JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set) JSON data
   structure for representing a set of JWKs.  Cryptographic algorithms
   and identifiers for use with this specification are described in the
   separate JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA] specification.

   Goals for this specification do not include representing certificate
   chains, representing certified keys, and replacing X.509
   certificates.

   JWKs and JWK Sets are used in the JSON Web Signature (JWS) [JWS] and
   JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [JWE] specifications.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in Key words for use in
   RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   JSON Web Key (JWK)  A JSON object that represents a cryptographic
      key.

   JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set)  A JSON object that contains an array of
      JWKs as the value of its "keys" member.

   Base64url Encoding  The URL- and filename-safe Base64 encoding
      described in RFC 4648 [RFC4648], Section 5, with the (non URL-
      safe) '=' padding characters omitted, as permitted by Section 3.2.
      (See Appendix C of [JWS] for notes on implementing base64url
      encoding without padding.)

   Collision Resistant Namespace  A namespace that allows names to be
      allocated in a manner such that they are highly unlikely to
      collide with other names.  For instance, collision resistance can
      be achieved through administrative delegation of portions of the
      namespace or through use of collision-resistant name allocation
      functions.  Examples of Collision Resistant Namespaces include:
      Domain Names, Object Identifiers (OIDs) as defined in the ITU-T
      X.660 and X.670 Recommendation series, and Universally Unique
      IDentifiers (UUIDs) [RFC4122].  When using an administratively
      delegated namespace, the definer of a name needs to take

Internet-Draft                     JWK                        April 2013


      reasonable precautions to ensure they are in control of the
      portion of the namespace they use to define the name.


3.  JSON Web Key (JWK) Format

   A JSON Web Key (JWK) is a JSON object containing specific members, as
   specified below.  Those members that are common to all key types are
   defined below.

   In addition to the common parameters, each JWK will have members that
   are specific to the kind of key being represented.  These members
   represent the parameters of the key.  Section 5 of the JSON Web
   Algorithms (JWA) [JWA] specification defines multiple kinds of
   cryptographic keys and their associated members.

   The member names within a JWK MUST be unique; objects with duplicate
   member names MUST be rejected.

   Additional members MAY be present in the JWK.  If not understood by
   implementations encountering them, they MUST be ignored.  Member
   names used for representing key parameters for different kinds of
   keys need not be distinct.  Any new member name SHOULD either be
   registered in the IANA JSON Web Key Parameters registry Section 6.1
   or be a value that contains a Collision Resistant Namespace.

3.1.  "kty" (Key Type) Parameter

   The "kty" (key type) member identifies the cryptographic algorithm
   family used with the key. "kty" values SHOULD either be registered in
   the IANA JSON Web Key Types registry [JWA] or be a value that
   contains a Collision Resistant Namespace.  The "kty" value is a case
   sensitive string.  Use of this member is REQUIRED.

   A list of defined "kty" values can be found in the IANA JSON Web Key
   Types registry [JWA]; the initial contents of this registry are the
   values defined in Section 5.1 of the JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA]
   specification.

   Additional members used with these "kty" values can be found in the
   IANA JSON Web Key Parameters registry Section 6.1; the initial
   contents of this registry are the values defined in Sections 5.2 and
   5.3 of the JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA] specification.

3.2.  "use" (Key Use) Parameter

   The "use" (key use) member identifies the intended use of the key.
   Values defined by this specification are:



Jones                   Expires October 27, 2013                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                     JWK                        April 2013


   o  "sig" (signature or MAC operation)

   o  "enc" (encryption)

   Other values MAY be used.  The "use" value is a case sensitive
   string.  Use of this member is OPTIONAL.

3.3.  "alg" (Algorithm) Parameter

   The "alg" (algorithm) member identifies the algorithm intended for
   use with the key.  The values used in this field are the same as
   those used in the JWS [JWS] and JWE [JWE] "alg" and "enc" header
   parameters; these values can be found in the JSON Web Signature and
   Encryption Algorithms registry [JWA].  Use of this member is
   OPTIONAL.

3.4.  "kid" (Key ID) Parameter

   The "kid" (key ID) member can be used to match a specific key.  This
   can be used, for instance, to choose among a set of keys within a JWK
   Set during key rollover.  The interpretation of the "kid" value is
   unspecified.  Key ID values within a JWK Set need not be unique.  The
   "kid" value is a case sensitive string.  Use of this member is
   OPTIONAL.

   When used with JWS or JWE, the "kid" value can be used to match a JWS
   or JWE "kid" header parameter value.

   In some contexts, different keys using the same Key ID value might be
   present, with the keys being disambiguated using other information,
   such as the "kty" or "use" values.  For example, imagine "kid" values
   like "Current", "Upcoming", and "Deprecated", used for key rollover
   guidance.  One could apply a label to all keys where the
   classification fits.  If there are multiple "Current" keys, then in
   this example, they might be differentiated either by having different
   "kty" or "use" values, or some combination of both.  As one example,
   there might only be one current RSA signing key and one current
   Elliptic Curve signing key, but both would be "Current".


4.  JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set) Format

   A JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set) is a JSON object that contains an array
   of JSON Web Key values as the value of its "keys" member.

   The member names within a JWK Set MUST be unique; objects with
   duplicate member names MUST be rejected.

Internet-Draft                     JWK                        April 2013


   Additional members MAY be present in the JWK Set. If not understood
   by implementations encountering them, they MUST be ignored.
   Parameters for representing additional properties of JWK Sets SHOULD
   either be registered in the IANA JSON Web Key Set Parameters registry
   Section 6.2 or be a value that contains a Collision Resistant
   Namespace.

4.1.  "keys" (JSON Web Key Set) Parameter

   The value of the "keys" (JSON Web Key Set) member is an array of JSON
   Web Key (JWK) values.  Use of this member is REQUIRED.


5.  String Comparison Rules

   Processing a JWK inevitably requires comparing known strings to
   values in JSON objects.  For example, in checking what the key type
   is, the Unicode string encoding "kty" will be checked against the
   member names in the JWK to see if there is a matching name.

   Comparisons between JSON strings and other Unicode strings MUST be
   performed by comparing Unicode code points without normalization as
   specified in the String Comparison Rules in Section 5.3 of [JWS].


6.  IANA Considerations

   The following registration procedure is used for all the registries
   established by this specification.

   Values are registered with a Specification Required [RFC5226] after a
   two-week review period on the [TBD]@ietf.org mailing list, on the
   advice of one or more Designated Experts.  However, to allow for the
   allocation of values prior to publication, the Designated Expert(s)
   may approve registration once they are satisfied that such a
   specification will be published.

   Registration requests must be sent to the [TBD]@ietf.org mailing list
   for review and comment, with an appropriate subject (e.g., "Request
   for access token type: example"). [[ Note to RFC-EDITOR: The name of
   the mailing list should be determined in consultation with the IESG
   and IANA.  Suggested name: jose-reg-review. ]]

   Within the review period, the Designated Expert(s) will either
   approve or deny the registration request, communicating this decision
   to the review list and IANA.  Denials should include an explanation
   and, if applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request
   successful.

Internet-Draft                     JWK                        April 2013


   IANA must only accept registry updates from the Designated Expert(s)
   and should direct all requests for registration to the review mailing
   list.

6.1.  JSON Web Key Parameters Registry

   This specification establishes the IANA JSON Web Key Parameters
   registry for reserved JWK parameter names.  The registry records the
   reserved parameter name and a reference to the specification that
   defines it.  This specification registers the parameter names defined
   in Section 3.  The same JWK parameter name may be registered multiple
   times, provided that duplicate parameter registrations are only for
   algorithm-specific JWK parameters; in this case, the meaning of the
   duplicate parameter name is disambiguated by the "kty" value of the
   JWK containing it.

6.1.1.  Registration Template

   Parameter Name:
      The name requested (e.g., "example").  This name is case
      sensitive.  Names that match other registered names in a case
      insensitive manner SHOULD NOT be accepted.

   Change Controller:
      For Standards Track RFCs, state "IETF".  For others, give the name
      of the responsible party.  Other details (e.g., postal address,
      email address, home page URI) may also be included.

   Specification Document(s):
      Reference to the document(s) that specify the parameter,
      preferably including URI(s) that can be used to retrieve copies of
      the document(s).  An indication of the relevant sections may also
      be included but is not required.

   registry for reserved JWK Set parameter names.  The registry records
   the reserved parameter name and a reference to the specification that
   defines it.  This specification registers the parameter names defined
   in Section 4.

      of the responsible party.  Other details (e.g., postal address,
      email address, home page URI) may also be included.

   Specification Document(s):
      Reference to the document(s) that specify the parameter,
      preferably including URI(s) that can be used to retrieve copies of
      the document(s).  An indication of the relevant sections may also
      be included but is not required.

   o  Change Controller: IETF
   o  Specification Document(s): Section 4.1 of [[ this document ]]


7.  Security Considerations

   All of the security issues faced by any cryptographic application
   must be faced by a JWS/JWE/JWK agent.  Among these issues are
   protecting the user's private and symmetric keys, preventing various
   attacks, and helping the user avoid mistakes such as inadvertently
   encrypting a message for the wrong recipient.  The entire list of
   security considerations is beyond the scope of this document, but
   some significant considerations are listed here.



Jones                   Expires October 27, 2013                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                     JWK                        April 2013


   A key is no more trustworthy than the method by which it was
   received.

   Private and symmetric keys must be protected from disclosure to
   unintended parties.  One recommended means of doing so is to encrypt
   JWKs or JWK Sets containing them by using the JWK or JWK Set value as
   the plaintext of a JWE.

   The security considerations in RFC 3447 [RFC3447] and RFC 6030
   [RFC6030] about protecting private and symmetric keys also apply to
   this specification.

   The security considerations in XML DSIG 2.0
   [W3C.CR-xmldsig-core2-20120124], about key representations also apply
   to this specification, other than those that are XML specific.

Appendix A.  Example JSON Web Key Sets

A.1.  Example Public Keys

   The following example JWK Set contains two public keys represented as
   JWKs: one using an Elliptic Curve algorithm and a second one using an
   RSA algorithm.  The first specifies that the key is to be used for
   encryption.  The second specifies that the key is to be used with the
   "RS256" algorithm.  Both provide a Key ID for key matching purposes.
   In both cases, integers are represented using the base64url encoding
   of their big endian representations.  (Long lines are broken are for
   display purposes only.)

A.2.  Example Private Keys

   The following example JWK Set contains two keys represented as JWKs
   containing both public and private key values: one using an Elliptic
   Curve algorithm and a second one using an RSA algorithm.  This
   example extends the example in the previous section, adding private
   key values.  (Line breaks are for display purposes only.)

Appendix B.  Acknowledgements

   A JSON representation for RSA public keys was previously introduced
   by John Panzer, Ben Laurie, and Dirk Balfanz in Magic Signatures
   [MagicSignatures].

   This specification is the work of the JOSE Working Group, which
   includes dozens of active and dedicated participants.  In particular,
   the following individuals contributed ideas, feedback, and wording
   that influenced this specification:

   Dirk Balfanz, Richard Barnes, John Bradley, Brian Campbell, Breno de
   Medeiros, Joe Hildebrand, Edmund Jay, Ben Laurie, James Manger, Tony
   Nadalin, Axel Nennker, John Panzer, Eric Rescorla, Nat Sakimura, Jim
   Schaad, Paul Tarjan, Hannes Tschofenig, and Sean Turner.

   Jim Schaad and Karen O'Donoghue chaired the JOSE working group and
   Sean Turner and Stephen Farrell served as Security area directors
   during the creation of this specification.

Internet-Draft                     JWK                        April 2013


   o  No changes were made, other than to the version number and date.

   -09

   o  Expanded the scope of the JWK specification to include private and
      symmetric key representations, as specified by
      draft-jones-jose-json-private-and-symmetric-key-00.

   o  Defined that members that are not understood must be ignored.

   -08

   o  Changed the name of the JWK key type parameter from "alg" to "kty"
      to enable use of "alg" to indicate the particular algorithm that
      the key is intended to be used with.

   o  Clarified statements of the form "This member is OPTIONAL" to "Use
      of this member is OPTIONAL".

   o  Referenced String Comparison Rules in JWS.

   o  Added seriesInfo information to Internet Draft references.

   -07

   o  Changed the name of the JWK RSA modulus parameter from "mod" to
      "n" and the name of the JWK RSA exponent parameter from "xpo" to
      "e", so that the identifiers are the same as those used in RFC
      3447.

   -06

   o  Changed the name of the JWK RSA exponent parameter from "exp" to
      "xpo" so as to allow the potential use of the name "exp" for a
      future extension that might define an expiration parameter for
      keys.  (The "exp" name is already used for this purpose in the JWT
      specification.)

   o  Clarify that the "alg" (algorithm family) member is REQUIRED.

   o  Correct an instance of "JWK" that should have been "JWK Set".

   o  Applied changes made by the RFC Editor to RFC 6749's registry
      language to this specification.

   -05

   o  Indented artwork elements to better distinguish them from the body
      text.

   -04

   o  Refer to the registries as the primary sources of defined values
      and then secondarily reference the sections defining the initial
      contents of the registries.

   o  Normatively reference XML DSIG 2.0 [W3C.CR-xmldsig-core2-20120124]
      for its security considerations.

   o  Added this language to Registration Templates: "This name is case
      sensitive.  Names that match other registered names in a case
      insensitive manner SHOULD NOT be accepted."

   o  Described additional open issues.

   o  Applied editorial suggestions.

   -03

   o  Clarified that "kid" values need not be unique within a JWK Set.

   o  Moved JSON Web Key Parameters registry to the JWK specification.

   o  Added "Collision Resistant Namespace" to the terminology section.

   o  Changed registration requirements from RFC Required to
      Specification Required with Expert Review.

   o  Added Registration Template sections for defined registries.

   o  Added Registry Contents sections to populate registry values.

   o  Numerous editorial improvements.

   -02

   o  Simplified JWK terminology to get replace the "JWK Key Object" and
      "JWK Container Object" terms with simply "JSON Web Key (JWK)" and
      "JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set)" and to eliminate potential confusion
      between single keys and sets of keys.  As part of this change, the
      top-level member name for a set of keys was changed from "jwk" to
      "keys".

   o  Clarified that values with duplicate member names MUST be
      rejected.

   o  Established JSON Web Key Set Parameters registry.

   o  Explicitly listed non-goals in the introduction.

   o  Moved algorithm-specific definitions from JWK to JWA.

   o  Reformatted to give each member definition its own section
      heading.

   -01

   o  Corrected the Magic Signatures reference.

   -00

   o  Created the initial IETF draft based upon
      draft-jones-json-web-key-03 with no normative changes.
