This document describes the use of the Common Open Policy Service
(COPS) protocol for support of policy provisioning (COPS-PR).  This
specification is independent of the type of policy being provisioned
(QoS, Security, etc.) but focuses on the mechanisms and conventions
used to communicate provisioned information between PDPs and PEPs.
The protocol extensions described in this document do not make any
assumptions about the policy data model being communicated, but
describe the message formats and objects that carry the modeled policy
data.

This document is a product of the Resource Allocation Protocol Working
Group of IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
