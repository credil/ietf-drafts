1.  Introduction

   IP packet loss rate is one of the important metrics that are
   frequently used to measure IP performance of a data path or link.  A
   general framework of IP performance metrics is provided in [RFC2330],
   including fundamental concepts definition and issues related to
   defining sound metrics and methodologies.  [RFC2680] and [RFC6673]
   further define metrics for one-way and round-trip packet loss.

   In practical network operation, a number of methods are used by
   network engineers to calculate packet loss rate, and one of the
   common ways is to use ping.  By checking ping statistics, people
   expect to get the idea of traffic transmission condition on the link.
   This document gives an overview of the frequently used methods for

   measuring IP packet loss rate, and describes a test on packet loss
   rate measurement with multiple methods using routers from different
   vendors.  Issues that should be taken into consideration during the
   measurement using different methods are discussed.  Causes analysis
   and processing mechanisms of routers are also covered.  It is
   expected that an operable measurement scheme with consistent testing
   results and equal treatment of network components can be reached.

2.  Methods for Packet Loss Rate Measurement

   This section describes common methods for measuring packet loss rate.

2.1.  Active Approach

2.1.1.  Ping

   Ping (ICMP echo request/reply) is a useful tool to examine the
   connectivity and performance of a path between two nodes in the
   network.  The source node generates echo request packets with
   configured size, interval, count and other settings, and the
   destination node sends back an echo reply packet once it receives a
   request.  Then we count the packets sent out and received and get the
   round-trip packet loss rate on the link between source and
   destination.  This approach is clear and convenient, and is
   frequently used by engineers when packet loss rate is needed.

   In practical network operation, the ping testing can be initiated
   manually and directly on the node by engineers, for example through
   the command line interface (CLI) of a router, or activated indirectly
   by instructions, for example through SNMP messages sent from network
   management system.

   No matter through CLI or SNMP, ping testing can be conducted directly
   on the endpoint devices of the link to be tested, or other nodes as
   long as the request/reply packets pass through the link.  Those nodes
   are often referred to as probes, which can be a router or a PC
   server, directly connected or indirectly reachable to the endpoints.
   Usually the probes and paths to the endpoints are not supposed to be
   congested to avoid affecting the ping testing result.

2.1.2.  OWAMP and TWAMP

   The One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP, [RFC4656]) and Two-
   Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP, [RFC5357]) are defined by the
   IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group.  They provide a method
   and protocol for measuring delay and packet loss of IP flows, and are
   designed for wide scale deployment in the network to provide
   ubiquitous performance data.  Both OWAMP and TWAMP use control

Internet-Draft           Packet Loss Measurement               July 2013


   protocol and test protocol.  The control protocol is used to
   negotiate test session between test endpoints, start and stop the
   test, and fetch the test result for OWAMP.  The test protocol runs
   over UDP and conducts the test.

   OWAMP can be used to perform one-way packet loss measurement, and
   requires synchronized time defined by GPS.  The test results are
   collected at the receiving endpoints and returned using the control
   protocol.  TWAMP is more simplified, and used for two-way packet loss
   measurement.  The opposite endpoint is regarded as a reflector, and
   the test results are collected at the sender.

2.1.3.  Proprietary Tools

   There are some other proprietary performance measurement tools
   incorporating embedded and external probes.  The probes generate and
   inject extra packets into the network to mimic the service flows that
   are intended to be tested.  The performance of the target service
   flows can be evaluated by measuring the performance of the injected
   packets.  Compared with Ping, these proprietary tools normally
   support more services, which include not only ICMP, but TCP, UDP,
   HTTP, etc.

   The embedded proprietary tools have been widely implemented by
   routers to provide automatic detection of IP performance.  Examples
   of this kind of tools include RPM (Juniper), IPSLA (Cisco), NQA
   (Huawei/H3C), SAA (ALU), etc.  By necessary configurations on the
   router, the embedded tools support multi-service testing of multiple
   queues on an interface.  Packet loss rate can be measured with ICMP
   ping function of the tool.  Routers send out ICMP packets
   automatically according to the configured parameters, so the embedded
   tool is working in a similar way as ping method described above.

2.2.  Passive Approach

2.2.1.  Interface Statistics Report

   Forwarding devices maintain statistics report of every interface.
   The report shows the detailed status of the interface as well as
   traffic information, including inbound and outbound speed and packet
   count.  For a typical router, traffic statistics show number of
   packets transmitted and discarded by an interface, and even on the
   basis of QoS queue, so the entire packet loss rate of a link or
   packet loss rates regarding different queues can be calculated.
   Traffic data on the report can be displayed through CLI or obtained
   using SNMP which allows automatic packet loss sampling.

2.2.2.  Coloring Based Performance Measurement

   The concept of coloring based performance measurement is introduced
   in [I-D.tempia-opsawg-p3m], and [I-D.chen-coloring-based-ipfpm-
   framework] defines a framework for coloring based IP Flow Performance
   Measurement (IPFPM).  By periodically setting/changing one or more
   bits of the IP header of the packets that belong to an IP flow to
   "color" the packets into different colors, the IP flow is split into
   different consecutive blocks.  Packets in the same block have the
   same color and packets in consecutive blocks have different colors.
   This method gives a way to a measurement node to count and calculate,
   without inserting any extra auxiliary OAM packets, packet loss based
   on each color block.  Since the measurement is based on the real
   traffic data, the measurement results will reflect the real
   performance of the tested flow.

3.  Test on Packet Loss Rate Measurement

   This section describes test result on packet loss rate measurement
   using different methods.  Test equipment covers routers from several
   vendors.  Results show the diverse outcome of the methods used, and
   the diverse responding mechanism of routers.

3.1.  Basic Test Information

   The basic topology of testing can be depicted as follows.

   +--------+      +---------+           +---------+      +--------+
   | Probe1 |------| Router1 |-----------| Router2 |------| Probe2 |
   +--------+  GE  +---------+  10G POS  +---------+  GE  +--------+
                       | |                   | |
                  10GE | | 10GE         10GE | | 10GE
                       | |                   | |
                 Port1 | | Port2       Port3 | | Port4
                     +---------------------------+
                     |           Tester          |
                     +---------------------------+

            Figure 1: Basic topology for packet loss rate test

   Two routers are connected by a 10G POS link, and each router is
   connected to the tester by two 10GE links.  The tester generates
   unidirectional/bidirectional traffic between port 1 and port 3, and
   between port 2 and port 4, with frame length of 400 bytes.  The total
   volume of traffic injected into a router by the tester is more than
   10G, leading to congestion when the traffic passes through the 10G
   POS link between the two routers.  Routers and probes generate ping
   packets for testing, with frame length of 400 and DSCP field of 0.

   We tested routers from 3 vendors, indicated as A, B, and C in the
   following parts of discussion.  The tester generated different levels
   of congestion, and we tested packet loss rates on the 10G POS
   interconnection link on those congestion levels with CLI, SNMP, and
   interface statistics report.

3.2.  Ping with CLI vs. SNMP

   Some routing boxes by default treat ping packets generated with CLI
   and SNMP in different ways.  The following is a test on this issue.

   to tester    +---------+           +---------+    to tester
      ---10G----| Router1 |-----------| Router2 |----10G---
      ---10G----|         |    10G    |         |----10G---
                +---------+           +---------+

             ping with CLI ---------->
             ping with SNMP---------->
      test traffic
      ---------------------------------------------------->


   The tester generates test traffic at 20 Gbps, and sends the traffic
   into a router of vendor A. The traffic goes through the 10G
   interconnecting link and past the router of vendor B on the other
   end.  We use ping with CLI and SNMP on router A to test packet loss
   rate on the interconnecting link.  The DSCP fields of test traffic
   and ping packets are all left to be 0..

   By default, router A forwards the test traffic with the basic
   priority, like BE class.  The ping packets with CLI are also treated
   as of best effort class, but ping packets with SNMP are given a
   higher priority, some class like network control.  So the two kinds
   of ping are actually testing packet loss of streams in different
   classes.  The test result verifies the issue.  Ping with SNMP shows
   no packet loss, and ping with CLI shows a packet loss rate of around
   50%.

   The forwarding class of ICMP packets can be configured on router A.
   In the following tests we put all traffic in the same basic class.

3.3.  Ping Behaviors of Routers

   We considered the following test cases (TCs) when investigating
   packet loss rate with ping on the link between two different routers.

   TC 1:  Router sends ICMP echo request packets with SNMP instruction
      to the peering router.

   The link between the two routers is injected bidirectional or
   unidirectional test traffic to cause congestion.  The packet loss
   rate of test traffic is calculated with the Rx and Tx rate on the
   tester.  We use router A, B and C in pairs and get the ICMP packet
   loss rate in each test case.  The comparison of the packet loss rate
   of ICMP and test traffic shows diverse behaviors of ping process on
   routers.  The following tables show the test results

      Table 3: Test result when interconnecting router C and router B

   The behaviors of the three vendors' routers are summarized here, and
   we leave the discussion on reasons for the behaviors to the next
   section.

   Router A:  Ping by router A with SNMP, CLI and by the probe behind
      router A lead to similar usable results.  However, all the methods
      encounter larger errors when the test traffic is less congested.

   Router B:  Ping by router B with SNMP and CLI will not report
      correctly the packet loss rate of test traffic.  Ping by the probe
      behind router B gives usable result of packet loss rate, but also
      with certain errors.

   Router C:  Ping by router C with SNMP, CLI and by the probe behind
      router C will not report correctly the packet loss rate of test
      traffic.

   We can further highlight the outcomes when testing the packet loss
   rate on the interconnection link between each pair of routers.

   Router A - router B:  If one wants to get relatively accurate value
      of packet loss rate in all congestion scenarios, he is advised to
      use ping between probes (test case 5), or have A generate ping to
      the probe behind B.

   Router A - router C:  All the test methods will only reflect the
      outbound packet loss rate of A.

   Router B - router C:  Packet loss rate is difficult to measure with
      this combination- only using ping between probes (test case 5) can
      reflect the outbound packet loss rate of B.

3.4.  Statistics Report of Routers

   We also checked the interface statistics reports given with CLI on
   the 3 routers, and we confirmed that the outbound packet loss rate of
   an interface obtained from the statistics report was in accordance
   with the actual packet loss rate of test traffic.  The following
   table shows the test result.

4.  Measurement Issues

   This section describes issues encountered when measuring the packet
   loss rate of a link using different testing methods.

4.1.  Issues with Ping

   Routers from every vendor have their unique processing procedure when
   sending and receiving ICMP packets, thus resulting in diverse ping
   packet loss rates, as described in the section above.  Errors exist
   using the ping method, and in some cases ping no longer reflects the
   actual packet loss rate correctly.  Relevant issues that have to be
   taken into account include:

   Forwarding class:  When sending ping packets locally, routers are
      likely to put the packets into a certain QoS queue/class although
      the DSCP field of ICMP packets is kept zero.  QoS queue of ping
      may be different than that of the traffic to be measured, and even
      ping packets sent by CLI commands and SNMP are in different queues
      by default.  Usually forwarding class can be adjusted by CLI or
      SNMP commands.

   Inner priority:  For some routers, although ping traffic and service
      traffic will not be treated differently by QoS, packets sent out
      by the router itself, for example ping packets, are put into an
      inner high priority while other forwarding service traffic into
      low priority.  These kinds of inner priority are valid within the
      interior of routers and do not rewrite the packets.  One of the



Fan, et al.             Expires January 06, 2014               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft           Packet Loss Measurement               July 2013


      purposes of using the priorities is to get the protocol packets
      (ping included) processed in prior.  These priorities are set by
      vendor and may not be able to adjust, so in this case ping will
      not give the correct packet loss rate as ping packets are not
      processed and discarded together with service traffic.

   Ingress line card:  If the ping testing is conducted on a probe which
      is connected or IP reachable to the router, then the ping packets
      will be treated by the router as forwarding traffic, eliminating
      the queue and priority issues.  However, the location of
      interfaces through which ingress traffic is received matters when
      using some types of routers.  In this case, the router employs a
      polling schedule which allows traffic from different line cards or
      modules to get forwarding chance.  For a card with small volume of
      traffic, the chance will be little but not none.  So if ping
      packets come through a card different from the high-volume service
      traffic, the packets would probably get enough forwarding
      resources as ping traffic itself requires little bandwidth.  As a
      result, ping will suffer little from congestion and shows
      disaccord in packet loss rate.

   Internal rate limitation:  Routers normally have rate limitation
      towards CPU, which is considered a kind of protection to the
      control plane of routers.  So if a packet is sent to CPU for
      processing rather than line card ASIC (e.g. in many routers, an
      ICMP echo reply packet received in response to an earlier echo
      request packet sent by the router will be sent to the CPU), it
      might be influenced by the rate limiter.  Typical rate limitation
      of ICMP packets would be 1000 pps, though the value is highly
      dependent on vendor implementation and can be configured.  In
      practical deployment, if there is a large number of ICMP packets
      sending to a router, the ping test packets may be dropped, causing
      test errors.  This problem did not arise in our test in section 3
      as the ICMP traffic is rather small.

4.2.  Issues with OWAMP and TWAMP

   OWAMP and TWAMP fall into the category of active measurement, so the
   general issues of active measurement apply to them.  When using the
   two methods, one is advised to make sure that the measurement traffic
   will have the same drop probability as non-measurement traffic.
   However, it is usually difficult to guarantee this, as too many
   factors effect the behavior of traffic.

4.3.  Issues with Proprietary Tools

   Since the proprietary tools are implemented by vendors independently,
   interoperability is one of the major issues when using the tools,



Fan, et al.             Expires January 06, 2014               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft           Packet Loss Measurement               July 2013


   especially for one-way measurement.  Besides, these tools also share
   the common issues of active measurement.  The accuracy of results
   depends on the rate, numbers and interval of the injected packets.
   It also needs to guarantee that the injected packets follows the same
   path as the tested packets, otherwise the results cannot reflect the
   real performance.

   Although these tools provide automatic testing method, the basic
   principle is still to ping from the router itself.  So it is believed
   toolset method will experience the same issues about class and
   priority as local ping from router does.  However, we did not test
   diagnosis toolsets, and the discussion is left to be further
   continued.

4.4.  Issues with Interface Statistics Report

   Interface statistic is the most direct and accurate way to get
   performance of an interface.  Packet loss rate calculated from
   traffic statistics is in accordance with the expected value.  By
   referring to statistics collected from the endpoint routers,
   bidirectional packet loss rate can easily be obtained.

   However, this approach requires access to routers, while in some
   scenarios it is difficult to do that.  For example, if we would like
   to know the inbound packet loss rate of the interconnection link to
   another service operator, we may have to rely on statistics provided
   by the peering router.  Normally, this information is not easily
   shared by interworking operators.

4.5.  Issues with Coloring Based Performance Measurement

   The challenge for coloring based performance measurement is that
   there are not so many bits in the IP header that can be used for IP
   packet coloring.  Operators have to carefully think of the color bits
   selection to make sure that the setting and changing of the color
   bits will not affect the normal packet forwarding and process.

5.  Considerations and Recommendations

   We summarize the above analysis here and come to the following
   considerations:

   a.  The ping method to measure packet loss rate is easy to be
       influenced by the diverse processing mechanism of ICMP packet
       within routers.  If this method is to be used on a router, one is
       advised to make sure that the ICMP packets experience the same
       forwarding and discarding courses as the service traffic (of
       which the packet loss rate is to be measured) does, otherwise the

Internet-Draft           Packet Loss Measurement               July 2013


       measurement will not make sense.  When measuring with ping, the
       following points are also worth reminding:

       *  Packet loss rate given by measurement with ping is a value
          related to a certain forwarding class in which the ICMP
          packets are forwarded.  So it is not a scientific way to say
          what the packet loss rate is on a link if traffic is
          transmitted in more than one class on the link.

       *  Measurement with ping is enough if one only wants to get a
          general, qualitative picture of packet loss.  But if one is to
          measure precisely and quantitatively, possible errors
          (sometimes very large errors) should be taken into account.

       *  If configured in the right way on router, ping with CLI and
          SNMP lead to similar results.

   b.  It is more likely to get good results if a probe is used to
       perform ping measurement (though not 100% guaranteed), but
       following issues also need to be considered.

       *  If the probe is directly connected to a router, then a router
          port is occupied.  This will be a problem for routers with
          limited or expensive port resources, as the probing traffic is
          usually extremely small.

       *  If the probe is more than one hop away from a router, load of
          the path to the router is supposed to be under the congestion
          level.

   c.  Interface statistics report gives us the most accurate value of
       pack loss rate, and the value is irrelevant to router platforms.
       From the report we can find numbers of packets being received,
       transmitted, and discarded in different classes within a period
       of time, thus we get packet loss rate.  Actually this is indeed
       how packet loss rate is defined.

       *  Referring to report requires access to routers, which may be
          easier if routers are within a single administrative area.
          However it gets annoying if more routers are evolved, for
          instance measurement on a long path with a number of routers.

       *  Router interface report only gives the outbound packet loss
          rate.  If we want to see if traffic in the other direction is
          congested, we'll have to check the upstream routers in that
          direction.  This will be difficult on certain links, say,
          interconnection link to another provider.
