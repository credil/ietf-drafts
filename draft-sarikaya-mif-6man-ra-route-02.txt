         IPv6 RA Options for Multiple Interface Next Hop Routes
                  draft-sarikaya-mif-6man-ra-route-02

Abstract

   This draft defines new Router Advertisement options for configuring
   next hop routes on the mobile or fixed nodes.  Using these options,
   an operator can easily configure nodes with multiple interfaces (or
   otherwise multi-homed) to enable them to select the routes to a
   destination.  Each option is defined together with definitions of
   host and router behaviors.

Internet-Draft               New RA Options                February 2013


1.  Introduction

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery and IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
   protocols can be used to configure fixed and mobile nodes with
   various parameters related to addressing and routing [RFC4861],
   [RFC4862], [RFC4191].  DNS Recursive Server Addresses and Domain Name
   Search Lists are additional parameters that can be configured using
   router advertisements [RFC6106].

   Router Advertisements can also be used to configure fixed and mobile
   nodes in multi-homed scenarios with route information and next hop
   address.  Different scenarios exist such as the node is
   simultaneously connected to multiple access network of e.g.  WiFi and
   3G. The node may also be connected to more than one gateway.  Such
   connectivity may be realized by means of dedicated physical or
   logical links that may also be shared with other users nodes such as
   in residential access networks.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft               New RA Options                February 2013


3.  Default Route Configuration

   A host, usually a mobile host interested in obtaining routing
   information usually sends a Router Solicitation (RS) message on the
   link.  The router, when configured to do so, provides the route
   information using zero, one or more Next Hop Address and Route
   Information options in the router advertisement (RA) messages sent in
   response.

   The route options are extensible, as well as convey detailed
   information for routes.

   RS and RA exchange is for next hop address and route information
   determination and not for determining the link-layer address of the
   router.  Subsequent Neighbor Solicitation and Neighbor Advertisement
   exchange can be used to determine link-layer address of the router.

   It should be noted that the proposed options in this document will
   need a central site-wide configuration mechanism.  The required
   values can not automatically be derived from routing tables.

   Next hop address and related route information may be provided by
   some other means such as directly by the next hop routers.  In this
   document we assume that next hop routers are not able to provide this
   information.  One solution would be to develop an inter-router
   protocol to instigate the next hop routers to provide this
   information.  However, such a solution has been singled out due to
   the complexities involved.


4.  Host Configuration

   Router advertisement options defined in this document are used by
   Type C hosts.

   As defined in [RFC4191] Type C host uses a Routing Table instead of a
   Default Router List.


5.  Router Configuration

   The router MAY send one or more Next Hop Address options that specify
   the IPv6 next hop addresses.  Each Next Hop Address option may be
   associated with zero, one or more Route Prefix options that represent
   the IPv6 destination prefixes reachable via the given next hop.
   Router includes Route Prefix option in message to indicate that given
   prefix is available directly on- link.

Internet-Draft               New RA Options                February 2013


   Router MAY send a single Next Hop Address without any Route Prefix
   options.  When router sends Next Hop Address option that is
   associated with Router Prefix option, the router MUST use Next Hop
   and Route Prefix option defined in Section 8.  The Route Prefix MAY
   contain ::/0, i.e. with Prefix Length set to zero to indicate
   available default route.

   Fields:

   Type: TBD.

   Length: The length of the option (including the type and length
   fields) in units of 8 octets.  For example, the length for a prefix
   of length 16 is 5.

   Other fields are as in Section 6 and Section 7.


9.  Security Considerations

   Neighbor Discovery is subject to attacks that cause IP packets to
   flow to unexpected places.  Because of this, neighbor discovery
   messages MUST be secured, possibly using Secure Neighbor Discovery
   (SEND) protocol [RFC3971].
