            <t> This document describes JSON data structures representing registration information
                maintained by Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) and Domain Name Registries (DNRs).
                These data structures are used to form Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)
                query responses. </t>

        <section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
            <t> This document describes responses in the <xref target="RFC4627">JSON</xref> format
                for the RESTful web queries as defined by the <xref target="I-D.ietf-weirds-rdap-query"
                    >Registration Data Access Protocol Lookup Format</xref>. 
            </t>
            <t>
                The data model for JSON responses is specified in four sections:
                <list style="numbers">
                    <t>simple data types conveyed in JSON strings</t>
                    <t>data structures specified as JSON arrays or objects that are used repeatedly when building up larger objects</t>
                    <t>object classes representing structured data corresponding to a given query</t>
                    <t>the response to an error</t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t> 
                The object classes represent responses for two major categories of data: responses
                returned by Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) for registrations data related to IP
                addresses, reverse DNS names, and Autonomous System numbers; and responses returned
                by Domain Name Registries (DNRs) for registration data related to forward DNS names.
                The following object classes are served by both RIRs and DNRs:
                <list style="numbers">
                    <t>domains</t>
                    <t>nameservers</t>
                    <t>entities</t>
                </list>
                The information served by both RIRs and DNRs for these object classes overlap
                extensively and are given in this document as a unified model for both classes of
                service.
            </t>
            <t>
               In addition to the object classes listed above, RIRs also serve the following
               object classes:
                <list style="numbers">
                    <t>IP networks</t>
                    <t>Autonomous System numbers</t>
                </list>
            </t>

            <t>
                Object classes defined in this document represent a minimal set of what a
                compliant client/server MUST understand to function correctly, however
                some deployments may want to include additional object classes to suit
                individual needs.  Anticipating this
                need for extension, <xref target="json_naming"></xref> of this document defines a mechanism for
                extending the JSON objects that are described in this document.

                    The string literal "rdap_level_0" signifies conformance with this specification.
                    When custom JSON values are inserted into responses, conformance to those custom
                    specifications should use a string prefixed with the appropriate identifier from
                    the IANA prefix identifier registry specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-weirds-using-http"></xref>.

            <t>
                This section requests that the IANA establish an RDAP JSON Values Registry
                for use in the <xref target="status">status</xref>, <xref target="entity_object_class">role</xref>,
                <xref target="events">event action</xref>, and <xref target="domain_object_class">domain variant relation</xref>
                fields specified in RDAP.
            </t>
            <t>
                Each entry in the registry should contain the following fields:
                <list style="numbers">
                    <t>Value - the string value being registered.</t>
                    <t>Type - the type of value being registered. It should be one of the following:
                    <list style="symbols">
                        <t>'status' - denotes a value for the 'status' object member as defined by <xref target="status"></xref>.</t>
                        <t>'role' - denotes a value for the 'role' array as defined in <xref target="entity_object_class"></xref>.</t>
                        <t>'event action' - denotes a value for an event action as defined in <xref target="events"></xref>.</t>
                        <t>'domain variant relation' - denotes a relationship between a domain and a domain variant as
                        defined in <xref target="domain_object_class"></xref>.</t>
                    </list>
                    </t>
                    <t>Description - a one or two sentence description regarding the meaning of the value, how it might be used, and/or
                    how it should be interpreted by clients.</t>
                    <t>Registrant Name - the name of the person registering the value.</t>
                    <t>Registrant Contact Information - an email address, postal address, or some other information to be used
                    to contact the registrant.</t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t>
                This registry should be governed by a designated expert or multiple designated experts. Registration of values into
                this registry should be accomplished by providing the information above to the designated expert(s).
            </t>
            <t>
                Review of registrations into this registry by the designated expert(s) should be narrowly judged on the following
                criteria:
                <list style="numbers">
                  <t>
                      Values in need of being placed into multiple types must be assigned a separate registration
                      for each type.
                  </t>
                    <t>Values must be strings. They can be multiple words separated by single space characters. Every character
                    should be lowercased. If possible, every word should be given in English and each character should be US ASCII.</t>
                    <t>
                        Registrations should not duplicate the meaning of any existing registration. That is, if a request for
                        a registration is significantly similar in nature to an existing registration, the request should be denied.
                        For example, the terms 'maintainer' and 'registrant' are significantly similar in nature as they both
                        denote a holder of a domain name or Internet number resource. In cases where it may be reasonably argued
                        that machine interpretation of two similar values may alter the operation of client software, designated experts
                        should not judge the values to be of significant similarity.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Registrations should be relevant to the common usages of RDAP. Designated experts may rely upon the serving
                        of the value by a DNR or RIR to make this determination.

                Events represent actions that have taken place against a registered object at a
                certain date and time. Events have three properties: the action, the actor,
                and the date and time of the event (which is sometimes in the future). In some
                cases the identity of the actor is not captured.

                Events can be modeled in three ways:

                    <t>events with no designated actor</t>
                    <t>events where the actor is only designated by an identifier</t>
                    <t>events where the actor can be modeled as an entity</t>
                </list>
            </t>

                The arrays in <xref target="jcard_exmaple"></xref> with the first member of "adr" represent
                postal addresses. In the first example, the postal address is given as a an array of strings
                and constitutes a structured address. For components of the structured address that are not
                applicable, an empty string is given. Each member of that array aligns with the positions
                of a vCard as given in <xref target="RFC6350"></xref>. In this example, the following
                data corresponds to the following positional meanings:
                <list style="numbers">
                    <t>post office box - not applicable, empty string</t>
                    <t>extended address (e.g., apartment or suite number) - Suite 1234</t>
                    <t>street address - 4321 Rue Somewhere</t>
                    <t>locality (e.g., city) - Quebec</t>
                    <t>region (e.g., state or province) - QC</t>
                    <t>postal code - G1V 2M2</t>
                    <t>country name (full name) - Canada</t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t>
                The second example is an unstructured address. It uses the label attribute, which is a
                string containing a newline (\n) character to separate address components in an unordered,
                unspecified manner. Note that in this example the structured address array is still given but
                that each string is an empty string.

                DNSSEC provides data integrity for DNS through digital signing of
                resource records. To enable DNSSEC, the zone is signed by one or more
                private keys and the signatures stored as RRSIG records. To complete the
                chain of trust in the DNS zone hierarchy, a digest of each DNSKEY record
                (which contains the public key) must be loaded into the parent zone,
                stored as Delegation Signer (DS) records and signed by the parent's
                private key (RRSIG DS record), <xref target="RFC4034">"Resource Records for the DNS Security
                Extensions"</xref>. Creating the DS records in the parent zone can be
                done by the registration authority, <xref target="RFC5910">"Domain Name System (DNS) Security
                Extensions Mapping for the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)"</xref>.
             </t>
             <t>
                Only DS related information is provided by RDAP, since other information
                is not generally stored in the registration database. Other DNSSEC
                related information can be retrieved with other DNS tools such as dig.
            </t>
            <t>The <xref target="domain_object_class">domain object class</xref> can represent
            this information using either the 'dsData' or 'keyData' object arrays. Client implementers

            <t> It is often pointed out that many DNRs and one RIR support the <xref

                bit, EPP serves a different purpose which is the provisioning of Internet resources
                between registries and accredited registrars and serves a much narrower audience
                than that envisioned for RDAP. </t>
            <t> By contrast, RDAP has a broader audience and is designed for public consumption of
                data. Experience from RIRs with first generation RESTful web services for Whois
                indicate a large percentage of clients operate within browsers and other platforms
                where full-blown XML stacks are not readily available and where JSON is a better
                fit. </t>
            <t> Additionally, while EPP is used in much of the DNR community it is not a universal
                constant in that industry. And finally, EPP's use of XML predates the specification
                of JSON. If EPP had been defined today, it may very well have used JSON instead of
                XML. </t>
            <t> Beyond the specific DNR and RIR communities, the trend in the broader Internet
                industry is also switching to JSON over XML, especially in the area of RESTful web
                services (see <xref target="JSON_acendancy"/>). Studies have also found that JSON is
                generally less bulky and consequently faster to parse (see <xref
                    target="JSON_performance_study"/>). </t>
