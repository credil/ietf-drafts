			<t>
        <xref target="RFC5031_section_4_2_quote" pageno="false" format="default"/> shows the policy for registration of sub-services of the service URN with the 'sos' service type as defined in RFC 5031 <xref target="RFC5031" pageno="false" format="default"/> section 4.2.
</t>
        <texttable anchor="RFC5031_section_4_2_quote" title="Excerpt from RFC 5031 section 4.2.">
          <ttcol align="left"></ttcol>
          <c>
   The 'sos' service type describes emergency services requiring an
   immediate response, typically offered by various branches of the
   government or other public institutions.  Additional sub-services can
   be added after expert review and must be of general public interest
   and have a similar emergency nature.  The expert is designated by the
   ECRIT working group, its successor, or, in their absence, the IESG.
   The expert review should only approve emergency services that are
   offered widely and in different countries, with approximately the
   same caller expectation in terms of services rendered.  The 'sos'
   service is not meant to invoke general government, public
   information, counseling, or social services.
</c>
        </texttable>

			<t>
        Some existing emergency services are offered in one country only. Examples are the "Reporting spies" emergency service offered in South Korea and the "GAULA (anti-kidnapping)" emergency service offered in Colombia according to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_telephone_number
			</t>

			<t>
        Moreover, emergency services to be defined in future can initially be introduced in one country only.
			</t>

			<t>
        The policy for registration of sub-services of the service URN with the 'sos' service type as shown in <xref target="RFC5031_section_4_2_quote" pageno="false" format="default"/> which requires the emergency service to be "offered widely and in different countries, with approximately the same caller expectation in terms of services rendered" cannot be fulfilled for the emergency services identified above.

      <t>
        The policy for registration of sub-services of the service URN with the 'sos' service type as defined in RFC 5031 <xref target="RFC5031" pageno="false" format="default"/> prevents registration of a sub-service of the service URN with the 'sos' service type for the country specific emergency service.
			</t>
		</section>

		<section title="Requirement" toc="default">
      <t>
        REQ-1: It MUST be possible to register with IANA a sub-service of the service URN with the 'sos' service type as defined in RFC 5031 <xref target="RFC5031" pageno="false" format="default"/> for the country specific emergency service.
			</t>
		</section>

   		<section title="Solution" toc="default">
      <section title="Service URN assignment">
      <t>
        A country specific emergency service is identified by the service URN with the 'sos' service type as defined in RFC 5031 <xref target="RFC5031" pageno="false" format="default"/> with:
        <list style="symbols">
<t>the first sub-service set to 'country-specific';</t>
<t>the second sub-service identifying the country where the emergency service is deployed. The format of second sub-service is an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code as specified in ISO 3166-1; and</t>
<t>the third sub-service uniquely identifying the emergency service in the country where the emergency service is deployed. The value of the third sub-service is assigned by the public safety answering point (PSAP) offering the country specific emergency service.</t>
        </list>
        </t>
<t>Example:	urn:service:sos.country-specific.xy.567 can identify an emergency service identified by an emergency number 567 in a country identified by "xy" ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code as specified in ISO 3166-1.</t>

      <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <section title="'country-specific' sub-service of the service URN with the 'sos' service type">
        <t>urn:service:sos.country-specific  This service identifier has the same semantic as the urn:service:sos.</t>
        <t>Note: this sub-service is added to enable different registration policies for the country specific emergency services.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="country identifying sub-service of the service URN with the 'sos' service type and with the 'country-specific' sub-service">
        <t>service URN with the 'sos' service type, with the 'country-specific' first sub-service and with second sub-service indicating the country identified by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code as specified in ISO 3166-1 has the same semantic as the urn:service:sos. IANA is requested to register URN for each country identified by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code as specified in ISO 3166-1.</t>
        <t>Note: this sub-service is added to ensure uniqueness of URNs for the country specific emergency services.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="service URN for country specific emergency service">
        <t>A sub-service identifying a country specific emergency service can be added to the service URN with the 'sos' service type, with the 'country-specific' first sub-service and with country identifying second sub-service.
        </t>
        <t>
        The policy for registration of sub-services of the service URN with the 'sos' service type, with the 'country-specific' first sub-service and with country identifying second sub-service is "Expert Review" as defined in
   RFC 5226 <xref target="RFC5226" pageno="false" format="default"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
   The expert review should only approve emergency service that is offered by a public safety answering point (PSAP) in the country identified by the second sub-service of the service URN being registered. The emergency service is not required to be "offered widely and in different countries, with approximately the same caller expectation in terms of services rendered".</t>
        <t>
The expert is designated by the ECRIT working group, its successor, or, in their absence, the IESG.
