Internet-Draft   CLEFIA Cipher Algorithm Use with IPsec     October 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the use of the CLEFIA block cipher algorithm
   [RFC6114] in conjunction with several different modes of operation
   within IKEv1 [RFC2409], IKEv2 [RFC5996], IPsec-v2 ([RFC2401],
   [RFC2402], [RFC2406]), and IPsec-v3 ([RFC4301], [RFC4302],
   [RFC4303]).

1.1.  CLEFIA

   CLEFIA is a 128-bit blockcipher algorithm, with key lengths of 128,
   192, and 256 bits.  The algorithm of CLEFIA was published in 2007
   [FSE07].  Since AES was designed, cryptographic technologies have
   been advancing: new techniques on attack, design and implementation
   are extensively studied.  CLEFIA is designed based on the state-of-
   the-art techniques on design and analysis of block ciphers.  The
   security of CLEFIA has been scrutinized in the public community, and
   no security weaknesses have been reported so far.

   CLEFIA is a general purpose blockcipher, and offers high performance
   in software and hardware.  Especially, CLEFIA has an advantage in
   efficient hardware implementation over AES, Camellia, and SEED, which
   can be used in IPsec.  Its gate efficiency, which is defined as the
   ratio of speed to gate size, is superior to these ciphers [ISCAS08].

   Standardization of CLEFIA in other organizations is in progress.
   CLEFIA is proposed in ISO/IEC 29192-2 [ISO29192-2] and the CRYPTREC
   project for the revision of the e-Government recommended ciphers list
   in Japan [CRYPTREC].  ISO/IEC 29192 is a standardization project of
   "LightWeight Cryptography (LWC)", which is a cryptographic algorithm
   or protocol tailored for implementation in constrained environments
   including RFID tags, sensors, contactless smart cards and so on.  LWC
   contributes to the security of the constrained devices connecting
   with IP.

   The algorithm specification is described in RFC6114 [RFC6114].
   Further information about CLEFIA, which includes design rationale,
   security evaluations, implementation results, and a reference code,
   is available from [CLEFIAWEB].

2.  Modes of Operation

   CLEFIA is a 128-bit blockcipher algorithm, with key lengths of 128,
   192, and 256 bits.  CLEFIA has a common interface with the Advanced
   Encryption Standard (AES) [FIPS-197] in terms of a block size and key
   lengths.  Therefore, CLEFIA modes of operation are easily defined by
   replacing AES in modes of operation previously defined within IPsec/
   IKE without any limitation.  The only difference is that the
   underlying encryption primitive is CLEFIA instead of AES.

2.1.  Encryption

   CBC mode and Counter mode are encryption modes that are based on a
   block cipher algorithm.

   The use of CLEFIA in CBC mode (CLEFIA-CBC) and Counter mode (CLEFIA-
   CTR) for ESP is defined in the same manner as AES-CBC [RFC3602] and
   AES-CTR [RFC3686].

   The use of CLEFIA-CBC for IKEv1 and IKEv2 is also defined in the same
   manner as [RFC3602] and [RFC5996], respectively.  The use of CLEFIA-
   CTR for IKEv2 is defined in the same manner as [RFC5930].

2.2.  Message Authentication Codes (MACs)

   Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC) and Galois Message
   Authentication Code (GMAC) are message authentication codes that are
   based on a block cipher algorithm.  CMAC and GMAC provide integrity
   protection of message.

   The use of CLEFIA in CMAC mode (CLEFIA-CMAC) and GMAC mode (CLEFIA-
   GMAC) for ESP is defined in the same manner as AES-CMAC [RFC4494] and
   AES-GMAC [RFC4543].  The key size supported in CLEFIA-CMAC is 128
   bits.  CLEFIA-CMAC-96 is the CLEFIA-CMAC with 96-bit truncated output
   [RFC4494].  The key sizes supported in CLEFIA-GMAC are 128 bits, 192
   bits, and 256 bits.

2.3.  Authenticated Encryption

   CCM mode and Galois/Counter mode are authenticated encryption modes
   that are based on a block cipher algorithm.

   The use of CLEFIA in CCM mode (CLEFIA-CCM) and Galois/Counter mode
   (CLEFIA-GCM) for ESP is defined in the same manner as AES-CCM
   [RFC4309] and AES-GCM [RFC4106].  The use of CLEFIA-CCM and CLEFIA-
   GCM for IKEv2 is defined in the same manner as [RFC5282].

   Based on [RFC4309], the size of integrity check value (ICV) in

Internet-Draft   CLEFIA Cipher Algorithm Use with IPsec     October 2011


   CLEFIA-CCM also supports 8 octets, 12 octets, and 16 octets.  In the
   similar way, the size of ICV in CLEFIA-GCM supports 8 octets, 12
   octets, and 16 octets.

2.4.  Pseudo Random Functions (PRFs)

   IKEv2 uses pseudo-random functions (PRFs) to generate the secret keys
   that are used in IKE SAs and IPsec SAs.

   In the same manner as AES-CMAC-PRF-128 [RFC4615], CLEFIA-CMAC-PRF-128
   is identical to CLEFIA-CMAC defined in Section 2.2 except that the
   128-bit key length restriction is removed.

3.  IKEv1 Conventions

   As mentioned in Section 2, CLEFIA has a common interface with AES.
   Identifiers in Phase 1 and Phase 2 are defined in Section 6.

3.1.  Phase 1 Identifier

   For IKE phase 1 negotiations, IANA is requested to assign an
   Encryption Algorithm Identifier for CLEFIA-CBC.  The assigned
   identifier is shown in Section 6.

3.2.  Phase 2 Identifier

   For IKE phase 2 negotiations, IANA is requested to assign nine IPsec
   ESP Transform Identifiers for CLEFIA-CBC, CLEFIA-CTR, CLEFIA-CCM, and
   CLEFIA-GCM and three identifiers for CLEFIA-GMAC in the
   Authentication Algorithms registry.  The assigned identifiers are
   shown in Section 6.

   Identifiers in IKEv2 Transform Types are defined in Section 6.

4.1.  Transform Type 1

   For IKEv2 negotiations, IANA is requested to assign Transform Type 1
   identifiers for CLEFIA-CBC, CLEFIA-CTR, CLEFIA-CCM, and CLEFIA-GCM.

4.2.  Transform Type 2

   For IKEv2 negotiations, IANA is requested to assign Transform Type 2
   identifiers for CLEFIA-CMAC.  The assigned identifier is shown in
   Section 6.

4.3.  Transform Type 3

   For IKEv2 negotiations, IANA is requested to assign Transform Type 3
   identifiers for CLEFIA-CMAC and CLEFIA-GMAC.  The assigned
   identifiers are shown in Section 6.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security of CLEFIA algorithm has been scrutinized in the public
   community since the algorithm was proposed, and no security
   weaknesses have been reported so far.

   For other security considerations, please refer to the security
   considerations in previous RFCs ([RFC3602], [RFC3686], [RFC4106],
   [RFC4309], [RFC4494], [RFC4543], [RFC5930], and [RFC5996]).  These
   apply to this document as well.
