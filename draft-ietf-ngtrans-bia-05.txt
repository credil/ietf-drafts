This document specifies a mechanism of dual stack hosts using a
technique called "Bump-in-the-API"(BIA) which allows for the hosts to
communicate with other IPv6 hosts using existing IPv4 applications.
The goal of this mechanism is the same as that of the
Bump-in-the-stack mechanism, but this mechanism provides the
translation method between the IPv4 APIs and IPv6 APIs.  Thus, the
goal is simply achieved without IP header translation.

This document is a product of the Next Generation Transition Working
Group of the IETF.
