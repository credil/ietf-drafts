RADIUS Extensions for IPv4-Embedded Multicast and Unicast IPv6 Prefixes
               draft-hu-softwire-multicast-radius-ext-03

Abstract

   This document specifies a new Remote Authentication Dial-In User
   Service (RADIUS) attribute to carry the Multicast-Prefixes-64
   information, aiming to delivery the Multicast and Unicast IPv6
   Prefixes to be used to build multicast and unicast IPv4-Embedded IPv6
   addresses. this RADIUS attribute is defined based on the equivalent
   DHCPv6 OPTION_PREFIX64 option.

Internet-Draft  RADIUS Extensions for Multicast Prefixes   February 2013


1.  Introduction

   The solution specified in [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast] relies
   on stateless functions to graft part of the IPv6 multicast
   distribution tree and IPv4 multicast distribution tree, also uses
   IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation scheme to deliver IPv4 multicast traffic
   over an IPv6 multicast-enabled network to IPv4 receivers.  DS-Lite
   Multicast [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast] is a solution in
   particular to offer multicast service to DS-Lite serviced customers.

   [I-D.ietf-softwire-multicast-prefix-option] defines a DHCPv6 option
   that is meant to be used by a mB4 element to convey the IPv6 prefixes
   to be used for constructing IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses and
   extracting the IPv4 address when needed.  In order to be able to
   populate such an option, the DHCPv6 server must be pre-provisioned
   with the required Multicast Prefixes.

   In broadband environments, a customer profile may be managed by
   Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) servers, together
   with AAA for users.  The Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service
   (RADIUS) protocol [RFC2865] is usually used by AAA servers to
   communicate with network elements.  Since the Multicast-Prefixes-64
   information can be stored in AAA servers and the client configuration
   is mainly provided through DHCP running between the NAS and the
   requesting clients, a new RADIUS attribute is needed to send
   Multicast-Prefixes-64 information from the AAA server to the NAS.

   This document defines a new RADIUS attribute to be used for carrying
   the Multicast-Prefixes-64, based on the equivalent DHCPv6 option
   already specified in [I-D.ietf-softwire-multicast-prefix-option].

   This document makes use of the same terminology defined in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast] and
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format]

   This attribute can be in particular used in the context of DS-Lite
   Mulitcast, MAP-E Multicast and other IPv4-IPv6 Multicast techniques.
   This attribute is however not limited to DS-Lite Multicast.

   DS-Lite unicast RADIUS extentions are defined in [RFC6519] .

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terms DS-Lite multicast Basic Bridging BroadBand element (mB4)
   and the DS-Lite multicast Address Family Transition Router element
   (mAFTR) are defined in [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast]

3.  Multicast-Prefixes-64 Configuration with RADIUS and DHCPv6

   Figure 1 illustrates in DS-Lite scenario how the RADIUS protocol and
   DHCPv6 work together to accomplish Multicast-Prefixes-64
   configuration on the mB4 element for multicast service when an IP
   session is used to provide connectivity to the user.

    Figure 1: RADIUS and DHCPv6 Multicast-Prefixes-64 attribute Message
                           Flow for a IP Session

   The NAS operates as a client of RADIUS and as a DHCP Server/Relay for
   mB4.  When the mB4 sends a DHCPv6 Solicit message to NAS(DHCP Server/
   Relay).  The NAS sends a RADIUS Access-Request message to the RADIUS
   server, requesting authentication.  Once the RADIUS server receives
   the request, it validates it based on the sending client, and if the
   request is approved, the AAA server replies with an Access-Accept
   message including a list of attribute-value pairs that describe the
   parameters to be used for this session.  This list MAY contain the
   Multicast-Prefixes-64 attribute (asm-length,ASM_PREFIX64,ssm-length,
   SSM_PREFIX64,unicast-length,U_PREFIX64).Then,when the NAS receives
   the DHCPv6 Request message containing the OPTION_PREFIX64 option,the
   NAS SHALL use the prefixes returned in the RADIUS
   Multicast-Prefixes-64 attribute to populate the DHCPv6
   OPTION_PREFIX64 option in the DHCPv6 reply message.

   If the NAS does not receive the Multicast-Prefixes-64 attribute in
   the Access-Accept message, it MAY fall back to a pre-configured

   default Multicast-Prefixes-64, if any.  If the NAS does not have any
   pre-configured, the delivery of multicast traffic is not supported.

   NAS MAY be configured to return the configured Multicast-Prefixes-64
   by the AAA Server to any requesting client without relaying each
   received request to the AAA Server.

   Figure 2 describes another scenario, which accomplish DS-Lite
   Multicast-Prefixes-64 configuration on the mB4 element for multicast
   service when a PPP session is used to provide connectivity to the
   user.  Once the NAS obtains the Multicast-Prefixes-64 attribute from
   the AAA server through the RADIUS protocol, the NAS MUST store the
   received Multicast-Prefixes-64 locally.  When a user is online and
   sends a DHCPv6 Request message , the NAS retrieves the previously
   stored Multicast-Prefixes-64 and uses it as OPTION_PREFIX64 option in
   DHCPv6 Reply message.

   According to [RFC3315], if the DHCPv6 server to which the DHCPv6
   Renew message was sent at time T1 has not responded, the DHCPv6
   client initiates a Rebind/Reply message exchange with any available
   server.  In this scenario, the NAS receiving the DHCPv6 Rebind
   message MUST initiate a new Access-Request message towards the AAA
   server.  The NAS MAY include the Multicast-Prefixes-64 attribute in
   its Access-Request message.

4.  RADIUS Attribute

   This section specifies the format of the new RADIUS attribute.

4.1.  Multicast-Prefixes-64

   The Multicast-Prefixes-64 attribute conveys the IPv6 prefixes to be
   used in [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast] to synthesize IPv4-
   embedded IPv6 addresses.  The NAS SHALL use the IPv6 prefixes
   returned in the RADIUS Multicast-Prefixes-64 attribute to populate
   the DHCPv6 PREFIX64 Option
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-multicast-prefix-option] .

   This attribute MAY be used in Access-Request packets as a hint to the
   RADIUS server, for example, if the NAS is pre-configured with
   Multicast-Prefixes-64, these prefixes MAY be inserted in the
   attribute.  The RADIUS server MAY ignore the hint sent by the NAS,
   and it MAY assign a different Multicast-Prefixes-64 attribute.

   If the NAS includes the Multicast-Prefixes-64 attribute, but the AAA
   server does not recognize it, this attribute MUST be ignored by the
   AAA server.

   NAS MAY be configured with both ASM and SSM prefixes or only one of
   them.  Concretely, AAA server MAY return ASM or SSM prefix based on
   the user profile and service policies.  AAA MAY return both ASM and
   SSM prefixes.  When SSM prefix is returned by the AAA server, unicast
   IPv4-Embedded IPv6 prefix MUST also be returned by the AAA server.

   If the NAS does not receive the Multicast-Prefixes-64 attribute in
   the Access-Accept message, it MAY fall back to a pre-configured
   default Multicast-Prefixes-64, if any.  If the NAS does not have any
   pre-configured, the delivery of multicast traffic is not supported.

   If the NAS is pre-provisioned with a default Multicast-Prefixes-64
   and the Multicast-Prefixes-64 received in the Access-Accept message
   are different from the configured default, then the Multicast-
   Prefixes-64 attribute received in the Access-Accept message MUST be
   used for the session.

   A summary of the Multicast-Prefixes-64 RADIUS attribute format is
   shown Figure 3.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document has no additional security considerations beyond those
   already identified in [RFC2865] for the RADIUS protocol and in
   [RFC5176] for CoA messages.

   The security considerations documented in [RFC3315] and [RFC6052] are
   to be considered.
