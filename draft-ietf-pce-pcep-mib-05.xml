        This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
        Information Base for use with network management protocols in the
        Internet community.  In particular, it describes managed objects
        for modeling of Path Computation Element communication
        Protocol (PCEP) for communications between a Path Computation Client
        (PCC) and a Path Computation Element (PCE), or between two PCEs.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        The Path Computation Element (PCE) defined in <xref target="RFC4655"/>
        is an entity that is capable of computing a network path or route based
        on a network graph, and applying computational constraints.  A Path
        Computation Client (PCC) may make requests to a PCE for paths to be
        computed.
      </t>
      <t>
        The PCE communication protocol (PCEP) is the communication protocol
        between a PCC and PCE for point-to-point (P2P) path computations and
        is defined in <xref target="RFC5440"/>. Such PCEP communication
        interactions include path computation requests and path computation
        replies as well as notifications of specific states related to the use
        of a PCE in the context of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
        Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering.
      </t>
      <t>
        This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
        (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
        community. In particular, it defines a MIB module that can be
        used to manage PCEP communications between a PCC and a PCE, or
        between two PCEs.

      <t>
        For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
        Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7
        of RFC 3410 <xref target="RFC3410"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
        termed the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are
        generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol
        (SNMP). Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in
        the Structure of Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a
        MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in
        STD 58, RFC 2578 <xref target="RFC2578"/>,
        STD 58, RFC 2579 <xref target="RFC2579"/>, and
        ATD 58, RFC 2580 <xref target="RFC2580"/>.

        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 <xref
        target="RFC2119"/>.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>
        The terminology used in this document is built on notions introduced
        and discussed in PCE WG documents.  The reader should be familiar
        with these documents.
        <list style='hanging'>
          <t hangText="Domain:">
            any collection of network elements within a common sphere of
            address management or path computational responsibility.
          </t>
          <t hangText="IGP Area:">
            OSPF Area or ISIS level/area.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        This document also uses the terminology defined in
        <xref target="RFC4655"/> and <xref target="RFC5440"/>.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="PCEP MIB Module Architecture">
      <t>
        The PCEP MIB contains the following information:
        <list style='letters'>
          <t>
            PCEP entity status.
          </t>
          <t>
            PCEP peer information.
          </t>
          <t>
            PCEP session information.
          </t>
          <t>
            Notifications to indicate PCEP session changes.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <section title="Relations to other MIB modules">
        <t>
          The PCEP MIB imports the following textual conventions from the
          INET-ADDRESS-MIB defined in RFC 4001 <xref target="RFC4001"/>:
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>
              InetAddressType
            </t>
            <t>
              InetAddress
            </t>
          </list>

          PCEP relies on existing protocols which have specialized MIB
          objects to monitor their own activities.  Consequently this document
          considers that the monitoring of underlying protocols is out of scope
          of the PCEP MIB module.

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        The readable objects in the PCE-PCEP-MIB module (i.e., those
        with MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered
        sensitive in some environments since, collectively, they provide
        information about the amount and frequency of path computation
        requests and responses within the network and can reveal some
        aspects of their configuration.
      </t>
      <t>
        In such environments it is important to control also GET and NOTIFY
        access to these objects and possibly even to encrypt their values
        when sending them over the network via SNMP.
      </t>
      <t>
        SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
        Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
        even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
        allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
        in this MIB module.
      </t>
      <t>
        It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
        provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <xref target="RFC3410"/>, section
        8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
        authentication and privacy).
      </t>
      <t>
        Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
        RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
        enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
        responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
        instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
        the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
        rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>
        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned OBJECT
        IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:
      </t>

      <figure>

      	]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>
        Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication):  the IANA is
        requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree
        and to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When
        the assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace
        "XXX" (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to
        remove this note.
