                  Segment Routing with MPLS data plane
             draft-filsfils-spring-segment-routing-mpls-00

Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  A node
   steers a packet through a controlled set of instructions, called
   segments, by prepending the packet with an SR header.  A segment can
   represent any instruction, topological or service-based.  SR allows
   to enforce a flow through any topological path and service chain
   while maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node to the SR
   domain.

   The Segment Routing architecture can be directly applied to the MPLS
   data plane with no change in the forwarding plane.  This drafts
   describes how Segment Routing operates on top of the MPLS data plane.

Internet-Draft          Segment Routing with MPLS           October 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Segment Routing architecture [I-D.filsfils-rtgwg-segment-routing]
   can be directly applied to the MPLS data plane with no change in the
   forwarding plane.  This drafts describes how Segment Routing operates
   on top of the MPLS data plane.

   The Segment Routing use cases are described in in
   [I-D.filsfils-rtgwg-segment-routing-use-cases].

   Link State protocol extensions for Segment Routing are described in
   [I-D.previdi-isis-segment-routing-extensions],
   [I-D.psenak-ospf-segment-routing-extensions] and
   [I-D.psenak-ospf-segment-routing-ospfv3-extension].

1.1.  Illustration

   Segment Routing, applied to the MPLS data plane, offers the ability
   to tunnel services (VPN, VPLS, VPWS) from an ingress PE to an egress
   PE, without any other protocol than ISIS or OSPF
   ([I-D.previdi-isis-segment-routing-extensions] and
   [I-D.psenak-ospf-segment-routing-extensions]).  LDP and RSVP-TE
   signaling protocols are not required.

   Note that [draft-filsfils-rtgwg-segment-routing-ldp-interop-00]
   documents SR co-existence and interworking with other MPLS signaling
   protocols, if present in the network during a migration, or in case
   of non-homogeneous deployments.

   The operator only needs to allocate one node segment per PE and the
   SR IGP control-plane automatically builds the required MPLS
   forwarding constructs from any PE to any PE.
                                  P1---P2
                                 /       \
                    A---CE1---PE1         PE2---CE2---Z
                                 \       /
                                  P4---P4

                    Figure 1: IGP-based MPLS Tunneling

   In Figure 1 above, the four nodes A, CE1, CE2 and Z are part of the
   same VPN.

   PE2 advertises (in the IGP) a host address 192.0.2.2/32 with its
   attached node segment 102.

   CE2 advertises to PE2 a route to Z. PE2 binds a local label LZ to
   that route and propagates the route and its label via MPBGP to PE1

   with nhop 192.0.2.2 (PE2 loopback address).

   PE1 installs the VPN prefix Z in the appropriate VRF and resolves the
   next-hop onto the node segment 102.  Upon receiving a packet from A
   destined to Z, PE1 pushes two labels onto the packet: the top label
   is 102, the bottom label is LZ. 102 identifies the node segment to
   PE2 and hence transports the packet along the ECMP-aware shortest-
   path to PE2.  PE2 then processes the VPN label LZ and forwards the
   packet to CE2.

   Supporting MPLS services (VPN, VPLS, VPWS) with SR has the following
   benefits:

      Simple operation: one single intra-domain protocol to operate: the
      IGP.  No need to support IGP synchronization extensions as
      described in [RFC5443] and [RFC6138].

      Excellent scaling: one Node-SID per PE.


2.  MPLS Instantiation of Segment Routing

   When applied to MPLS, the 20 right-most bits of the segment are
   encoded as a label.  This implies that, in the MPLS instantiation,
   the SID values are allocated within a reduced 20-bit space out of the
   32-bit SID space.

   The notion of indexed global segment fits the MPLS architecture
   [RFC3031] as the absolute value allocated to any segment (global or
   local) can be managed by a local allocation process (similarly to
   other MPLS signaling protocols).

   As described in [RFC3031] labels can be signaled by various
   protocols.  Within a SR domain, LDP and RSVP MPLS signaling protocols
   are not required.  If present, SR can coexist and interwork with LDP
   and RSVP [draft-filsfils-rtgwg-segment-routing-ldp-interop-00].

   The source routing model described in
   [I-D.filsfils-rtgwg-segment-routing] is inherited from the ones
   proposed by [RFC1940] and [RFC2460].  The source routing model offers
   the support for explicit routing capability.

   Contrary to RSVP-based explicit routes where tunnel midpoints
   maintain states, SR-based explicit routes only require per-flow
   states at the ingress edge router where the traffic engineer policy
   is applied.

   Contrary to RSVP-based explicit routes which consist in non-ECMP

Internet-Draft          Segment Routing with MPLS           October 2013


   circuits (similar to ATM/FR), SR-based explicit routes can be built
   as list of ECMP-aware node segments and hence ECMP-aware traffic
   engineering is natively supported by SR.

   When Segment Routing is instantiated over the MPLS data plane the
   following applies:

      A list of segments is represented as a stack of labels.

      The active segment is the top label.

      The CONTINUE operation is implemented as an MPLS swap operation.
      When the same SRGB block is used throughout the SR domain, the
      outgoing label value is equal to the incoming label value .  Else,
      the outgoing label value is [SRGB(next_hop)+index]

      The NEXT operation is implemented as an MPLS pop operation.

      The PUSH operation is implemented as an MPLS push of a label
      stack.

   In conclusion, there are no changes in the operations of the data-
   plane currently used in MPLS networks.


3.  Segment List History

   In the abstract SR routing model
   [I-D.filsfils-rtgwg-segment-routing], any node N along the journey of
   the packet is able to determine where the packet P entered the SR
   domain and where it will exit.  The intermediate node is also able to
   determine the paths from the ingress edge router to itself, and from
   itself to the egress edge router.

   In the MPLS instantiation, as the packet travels through the SR
   domain, the stack is depleted and the segment list history is
   gradually lost.

   Future version of this document will describe how this information
   can be preserved in MPLS domains.
