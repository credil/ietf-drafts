Abstract

   This document specifies the behavior of the UPnP IGD (Internet
   Gateway Device)/PCP Interworking Function.  An UPnP IGD-PCP
   Interworking Function (IGD-PCP IWF) is required to be embedded in CP
   routers to allow for transparent NAT control in environments where
   UPnP is used in the LAN side and PCP in the external side of the CP
   router.

1.  Introduction

   PCP [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] discusses the implementation of NAT control
   features that rely upon Carrier Grade NAT devices such as DS-Lite
   AFTR [RFC6333] or NAT64 [RFC6146].  Nevertheless, in environments
   where UPnP is used in the local network, an interworking function
   between UPnP IGD and PCP is required to be embedded in the CP router
   (see the example illustrated in Figure 1).

   Two configurations are considered:

   o  No NAT function is embedded in the CP router.  This is required
      for instance in DS-Lite or NAT64 deployments;

   o  The CP router embeds a NAT function.

                          Figure 1: Flow Example

   The UPnP IGD-PCP Interworking Function (IGD-PCP IWF) maintains a
   local mapping table which stores all active mappings instructed by
   internal UPnP Control Points.  This design choice restricts the
   amount of PCP messages to be exchanged with the PCP Server.

   Triggers for deactivating the UPnP IGD-PCP Interworking Function from
   the CP router and relying on a PCP-only mode are out of scope of this
   document.

3.  Architecture Model

   As a reminder, Figure 2 illustrates the architecture model adopted by
   UPnP IGD [IGD2].  In Figure 2, the following UPnP terminology is
   used:

   o  Client refers to a host located in the local network.

   o  IGD Control Point is a UPnP control point using UPnP to control an
      IGD (Internet Gateway Device).

   o  Host represents a remote peer reachable in the Internet.

                         Figure 2: UPnP IGD Model

   This model is not valid when PCP is used to control for instance a
   Carrier Grade NAT (a.k.a., Provider NAT) while internal hosts
   continue to use UPnP.  In such scenarios, Figure 3 shows the updated
   model.

   In the updated model depicted in Figure 3, one or two levels of NAT
   can be encountered in the data path.  Indeed, in addition to the
   Carrier Grade NAT, the CP router may embed a NAT function (Figure 4).

                      Figure 4: Cascaded NAT scenario

   To ensure a successful interworking between UPnP IGD and PCP, an
   interworking function is embedded in the CP router.  In the model
   defined in Figure 3, all UPnP IGD server-oriented functions, a PCP
   Client [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] and a UPnP IGD-PCP Interworking Function
   are embedded in the CP router (i.e., IGD).  In the rest of the
   document, IGD-PCP Interworking Function refers to PCP Client and UPnP
   IGD-PCP Interworking Function.

   UPnP IGD-PCP Interworking Function is responsible for generating a
   well-formed PCP (resp., UPnP IGD) message from a received UPnP IGD
   (resp., PCP) message.

4.  UPnP IGD-PCP Interworking Function: Overview

   Three tables are provided to specify the mapping between UPnP IGD and
   PCP:

   (1)  Section 4.1 provides the mapping between WANIPConnection State
        Variables and PCP parameters;

   (2)  Section 4.2 focuses on the correspondence between supported
        methods;

   (3)  Section 4.3 lists the PCP error messages and their corresponding
        IGD ones.

   Note that some enhancements have been integrated in WANIPConnection
   as documented in [IGD2].

4.1.  UPnP IGD-PCP: State Variables

   ConnectionType:  Not applicable
      Out of scope of PCP but as the controlled device is a NAT the
      default value IP_Routed is very likely used.

   PossibleConnectionTypes:  Not applicable
      Out of scope of PCP (same comment than for ConnectionType).

   ConnectionStatus:  Not applicable
      Out of scope of PCP but when it is possible to successfully
      communicate with a PCP Server the Connected value could be
      expected, otherwise Disconnected.

   Uptime:  Not applicable
      Out of scope of PCP (possible values are the number of seconds
      since a successful communication was established with a PCP
      Server, or with a state maintained in a stable storage the number
      of seconds since the initialization of the current state).

   LastConnectionError:  Not applicable
      Out of scope of PCP but expected to be ERROR_NONE in absence of
      errors.

   RSIPAvailable:  Not applicable
      Out of scope of PCP (expected to be 0, i.e., RSIP not available).

   ExternaIPAddress:  External IP Address
      Read-only variable with the value from the last PCP response or
      the empty string if none was received yet.

   PortMappingNumberOfEntries:  Not applicable
      Managed locally by the UPnP IGD-PCP Interworking Function.

   PortMappingEnabled:  Not applicable
      PCP does not support deactivating the dynamic NAT mapping since
      the initial goal of PCP is to ease the traversal of Carrier Grade
      NAT.  Supporting such per-subscriber function may overload the
      Carrier Grade NAT.
      On reading the value should be 1, writing a value different from 1
      is not supported.

   PortMappingLeaseDuration:  Requested Mapping Lifetime
      In IGD:1 the value 0 means infinite, in IGD:2 its is remapped to
      the IGD maximum of 604800 seconds [IGD2].  PCP allows for a
      maximum value of 65535 seconds.
      The UPnP IGD-PCP Interworking Function simulates long and even
      infinite lifetimes using renewals.  The behavior in the case of a
      failing renewal is currently undefined.
      IGD:1 doesn't define the behavior in the case of state lost, IGD:2
      doesn't require to keep state in stable storage, i.e., to make the
      state to survive resets/reboots.  Of course the IGD:2 behavior
      should be implemented.

   RemoteHost:  Unsupported
      Not yet supported by PCP (part of the firewall features).  Note a
      domain name is allowed by IGD:2 and has to be resolved into an IP
      address.

   ExternalPort:  External Port Number
      Not wildcard (0) value mapped to PCP external port field in MAP
      messages.  The explicit wildcard (0) value is not supported.

   InternalPort:  Internal Port Number
      Mapped to PCP internal port field in MAP messages.

   PortMappingProtocol:  Transport Protocol
      Mapped to PCP protocol field in MAP messages.  Note IGD only
      supports TCP and UDP.

   InternalClient:  Internal IP Address
      InternalClient can be an IP address or a domain name.  Only an IP
      address scheme is supported in PCP.  If a domain name is used
      Point, it must be resolved to an IP address by the Interworking
      Function when relying the message to the PCP Server.

   PortMappingDescription:  Not applicable
      Not supported in base PCP.  When present in UPnP IGD messages,
      this parameter SHOULD NOT be propagated in the corresponding PCP
      messages.  If the local PCP Client support a PCP Option to convey
      the description, this option MAY be used.

   SystemUpdateID (only for IGD:2):  Not applicable
      Managed locally by the UPnP IGD-PCP Interworking Function

   A_ARG_TYPE_Manage (only for IGD:2):  Not applicable
      Out of scope of PCP (but has a clear impact on security).

   A_ARG_TYPE_PortListing (only for IGD:2):  Not applicable
      Managed locally by the UPnP IGD-PCP Interworking Function

4.2.  IGD-PCP: Methods

   Both IGD:1 and IGD:2 methods are listed here.

   SetConnectionType:  Not applicable
      Calling this method doesn't make sense in this context.  An error
      (IGD:1 501 "ActionFailed" or IGD:2 731 "ReadOnly") may be directly
      returned.

   GetConnectionTypeInfo:  Not applicable
      May directly return values of corresponding State Variables.

   RequestConnection:  Not applicable
      Calling this method doesn't make sense in this context.  An error
      (IGD:1 501 "ActionFailed" or IGD:2 606 "Action not authorized")
      may be directly returned.

   ForceTermination:  Not applicable
      Same than RequestConnection.

   GetStatusInfo:  Not applicable
      May directly return values of corresponding State Variables.

   GetNATRSIPStatus:  Not applicable
      May directly return values of corresponding State Variables.

   GetGenericPortMappingEntry:  Not applicable
      This request is not relayed to the PCP Server.  IGD-PCP
      Interworking Function maintains an updated list of active mappings
      instantiated in the PCP Server by internal hosts.  See Section 5.8
      for more information.

   GetSpecificPortMappingEntry:  MAP with PREFER_FAILURE Option
      This request is relayed to the PCP Server by issuing MAP with
      PREFER_FAILURE Option.  It is RECOMMENDED to use a short lifetime
      (e.g., 60s).

   AddPortMapping:  MAP
      We recommend the use of AddAnyPortMapping() instead of
      AddPortMapping().  Refer to Section 5.7.2.

   AddAnyPortMapping (for IGD:2 only):  MAP
      No issue is encountered to proxy this request to the PCP Server.
      Refer to Section 5.7.1 for more details

   DeletePortMapping:  MAP with a requested lifetime set to 0
      Refer to Section 5.9.

   DeletePortMappingRange (for IGD:2 only):  MAP with a lifetime
      positioned to 0
      Individual requests are issued by the IGD-PCP Interworking
      Function.  Refer to Section 5.9 for more details

   GetExternalIPAddress:  Not applicable
      PCP does not support a method for retrieving the external IP
      address.  Issuing MAP may be used as a means to retrieve the
      external IP address.

5.  Specification of the IGD-PCP Interworking Function

   This section covers the scenarios with or without NAT in the CP
   router.

5.1.  PCP Server Discovery

   The IGD-PCP Interworking Function implements one of the discovery
   methods identified in [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] (e.g., DHCP
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp]).  The IGD-PCP Interworking Function behaves as a
   PCP Client when communicating with the provisioned PCP Server.

   In order to not impact the delivery of local services requiring the
   control of the local IGD during any failure event to reach the PCP
   Server (e.g., no IP address/prefix is assigned to the CP router),
   IGD-PCP Interworking Function MUST NOT be invoked.  Indeed, UPnP
   machinery is used to control that device and therefore lead to
   successful operations of internal services.

5.2.  Control of the Firewall

   In order to configure security policies to be applied to inbound and
   outbound traffic, UPnP IGD can be used to control a local firewall
   engine.

   No IGD-PCP Interworking Function is therefore required for that
   purpose.

5.3.  NAT Control in LAN Side

   Internal UPnP Control Points are not aware of the presence of the
   IGD-PCP Interworking Function in the CP router (IGD).  Especially,
   UPnP Control Points MUST NOT be aware of the deactivation of the NAT
   in the CP router.

   No modification is required in the UPnP Control Point.

5.4.  Port Mapping Tables

   IGD-PCP Interworking Function MUST store locally all the mappings
   instantiated by internal UPnP Control Points in the PCP Server.  Port
   Forwarding mappings SHOULD be stored in a permanent storage.

   Upon receipt of a PCP MAP Response from the PCP Server, the IGD-PCP
   Interworking Function MUST retrieve the enclosed mapping and MUST
   store it in the local mapping table.  The local mapping table is an
   image of the mapping table as maintained by the PCP Server for a
   given subscriber.

Internet-Draft     UPnP IGD-PCP Interworking Function         March 2012


5.5.  Interworking Function Without NAT in the CP Router

   When no NAT is embedded in the CP router, the content of received
   WANIPConnection and PCP messages is not altered by the IGD-PCP
   Interworking Function (i.e., the content of WANIPConnection messages
   are mapped to the PCP messages (and mapped back) according to
   Section 4.1).

5.6.  NAT Embedded in the CP Router

   Unlike the scenario with one level of NAT (Section 5.5), the IGD-PCP
   Interworking Function MUST update the content of received mapping
   messages with the IP address and/or port number belonging to the
   external interface of the CP router (i.e., after the NAT1 operation
   in Figure 4) and not as initially positioned by the UPnP Control
   Point.

   All WANIPConnection messages issued by the UPnP Control Point (resp.,
   PCP Server) are intercepted by the IGD-PCP Interworking Function.
   Then, the corresponding messages (see Section 4.1, Section 4.2 and
   Section 4.3) are generated by the IGD-PCP Interworking Function and
   sent to the provisioned PCP Server (resp., corresponding UPnP Control
   Point).  The content of PCP messages received by the PCP Server
   reflects the mapping information as enforced in the first NAT.  In
   particular, the internal IP address and/or port number of the
   requests are replaced with the IP address and port number as assigned
   by the NAT of the CP router.  For the reverse path, PCP response
   messages are intercepted by the IGD-PCP Interworking Function.  The
   content of the corresponding WANIPConnection messages are updated:

   o  The internal IP address and/or port number as initially positioned
      by the UPnP Control Point and stored in the CP router NAT are used
      to update the corresponding fields in received PCP responses.

   o  The external IP and port number are not altered by the IGD-PCP
      Interworking Function.

   o  The NAT mapping entry in the first NAT is updated with the result
      of PCP request.

   The lifetime of the mappings instantiated in all involved NATs SHOULD
   be the one assigned by the terminating PCP Server.  In any case, the
   lifetime MUST be lower or equal to the one assigned by the
   terminating PCP Server.

Internet-Draft     UPnP IGD-PCP Interworking Function         March 2012


5.7.  Creating a Mapping

   Two methods can be used to create a mapping: AddPortMapping() or
   AddAnyPortMapping().

   AddAnyPortMapping() is the RECOMMENDED method.

5.7.1.  AddAnyPortMapping()

   When an UPnP Control Point issues a AddAnyPortMapping(), this request
   is received by the UPnP Server.  The request is then relayed to the
   IGD-PCP Interworking Function which generates a PCP MAP Request (see
   Section 4.1 for mapping between WANIPConnection and PCP parameters).
   Upon receipt of PCP MAP Response from the PCP Server, an XML mapping
   is returned to the requesting UPnP Control Point (the content of the
   messages follows the recommendations listed in Section 5.6 or
   Section 5.5 according to the deployed scenario).  A flow example is
   depicted in Figure 5.

   If a PCP Error is received from the PCP Server, a corresponding
   WANIPConnection error code Section 4.3 is generated by the IGD-PCP
   Interworking Function and sent to the requesting UPnP Control Point.
   If a short lifetime error is returned (e.g., NETWORK_FAILURE,
   NO_RESOURCES), the PCP IWF MAY re-send the same request to the PCP
   Server after 30s.  If a negative answer is received, the error is
   then relayed to the requesting UPnP Control Point.

      Justification: Some applications (e.g., uTorrent, Vuzz, Emule)
      wait approximately 150s, 90s, 90s, respectively for a response
      after sending an UPnP request.  If a short lifetime error occurs,
      re-sending the requesting may lead to a positive response from the
      PCP Server.  UPnP Control Points are therefore not aware of short
      lifetime errors that were recovered quickly.

          Figure 5: Flow example when AddAnyPortMapping() is used

5.7.2.  AddPortMapping()

   A dedicated option called PREFER_FAILURE is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] to toggle the behavior in a PCP Request message.
   This options is inserted by the IGD-PCP IWF when issuing its requests
   to the PCP Server only if a specific external port is requested by
   the UPnP Control Point.  The mapping of wildcard (i.e., 0)
   ExternalPort is not yet defined.

   Upon receipt of AddPortMapping() from an UPnP Control Point, the IGD-
   PCP Interworking Function first checks if the requested external port
   number is not used by another Internal UPnP Control Point.  In case a
   mapping bound to the requested external port number is found in the
   local mapping table, the IGD-PCP IWF MUST send back a
   ConflictInMappingEntry error to the requesting UPnP Control Point
   (see the example shown in Figure 6).

   Some applications uses GetSpecificPortMapping() to check whether a
   mapping exists.

                       Figure 6: IWF Local Behaviour

   This exchange (Figure 6) is re-iterated until an external port number
   that is not in use is requested by the UPnP Control Point.  Then, the
   IGD-PCP IWF MUST generate a PCP MAP Request with all requested
   mapping information as indicated by the UPnP Control Point if no NAT
   is embedded in the CP router or updated as specified in Section 5.6.
   In addition, the IGD-PCP IWF MUST insert a PREFER_FAILURE Option to
   the generated PCP request.

   If the requested external port is in use, a PCP error message MUST be
   sent by the PCP Server to the IGD-PCP IWF indicating
   CANNOT_PROVIDE_EXTERNAL as the error cause.  If a short lifetime
   error is returned, the PCP IWF MAY re-send the same request to the
   PCP Server after 30s.  If a negative answer is received, the IGD-PCP
   IWF relays a negative message to the UPnP Control Point indicating
   ConflictInMappingEntry as error code.  The UPnP Control Point may re-
   issue a new request with a new requested external port number.  This
   process is repeated until a positive answer is received or maximum
   retry is reached.

   If the PCP Server is able to honor the requested external port, a
   positive response is sent to the requesting IGD-PCP IWF.  Upon

   receipt of the response from the PCP Server, the returned mapping
   MUST be stored by the IGD-PCP Interworking Function in its local
   mapping table and a positive answer MUST be sent to the requesting
   UPnP Control Point.  This answer terminates this exchange.

   Figure 7 shows an example of the flow exchange that occurs when the
   PCP Server satisfies the request from the IGD-PCP IWF.  Figure 8

Internet-Draft     UPnP IGD-PCP Interworking Function         March 2012


      Note: According to some experiments, some UPnP 1.0
      implementations, e.g.- uTorrent, simply try the same external port
      X times (usually 4 times) and then fail.

5.8.  Listing One or a Set of Mappings

   In order to list active mappings, an UPnP Control Point may issue
   GetGenericPortMappingEntry(), GetSpecificPortMappingEntry() or
   GetListOfPortMappings().

   GetGenericPortMappingEntry() and GetListOfPortMappings() methods MUST
   NOT be proxied to the PCP Server since a local mapping is maintained
   by the IGD-PCP Interworking Function.

   Upon receipt of GetSpecificPortMappingEntry() from an UPnP Control
   Point, the IGD-PCP IWF MUST check first if the external port number
   is used by the requesting UPnP Control Point or another Internal UPnP
   Control Point.  If the external port is already in use by the
   requesting UPnP Control Point, the IGD-PCP IWF MUST send back a
   positive answer.  If the external port is already in use by another
   UPnP Control Point, the IGD-PCP IWF MUST send back a
   ConflictInMappingEntry error to the requesting UPnP Control Point.
   If no mapping is found in the local mapping table, the IWF MUST realy
   to the PCP Server a MAP request, with short lifetime (e.g. 60s),
   including a PREFER_FAILURE Option.

5.9.  Delete One or a Set of Mappings: DeletePortMapping() or
      DeletePortMappingRange()

   A UPnP Control Point proceeds to the deletion of one or a list of
   mappings by issuing DeletePortMapping() or DeletePortMappingRange().
   In IGD:2, we assume the IGD applies the appropriate security policies
   to grant whether a Control Point has the rights to delete one or a
   set of mappings.  When authorization fails, "606 Action Not
   Authorized" error code MUST be returned the requesting Control Point.

   When DeletePortMapping() or DeletePortMappingRange() is received by
   the IGD-PCP Interworking Function, it first checks if the requested
   mappings to be removed are present in the local mapping table.  If no
   mapping matching the request is found in the local table an error
   code is sent back to the UPnP Control Point: "714 NoSuchEntryInArray"
   for DeletePortMapping() or "730 PortMappingNotFound" for
   DeletePortMappingRange().

   Figure 9 shows an example of UPnP Control Point asking to delete a
   mapping which is not instantiated in the local table of the IWF.

                   Figure 9: Local Delete (IGD-PCP IWF)

   If a mapping matches in the local table, a PCP MAP delete request is
   generated taking into account the input arguments as included in
   DeletePortMapping() if no NAT is enabled in the CP router or the
   corresponding local IP address and port number as assigned by the
   local NAT if a NAT is enabled in the CP router.  When a positive
   answer is received from the PCP Server, the IGD-PCP Interworking
   Function updates its local mapping table (i.e., remove the
   corresponding entry) and notifies the UPnP Control Point about the
   result of the removal operation.  Once PCP MAP delete request is
   received by the PCP Server, it proceeds to removing the corresponding
   entry.  A PCP MAP delete response is sent back if the removal of the
   corresponding entry was successful; if not, a PCP Error is sent back
   to the IGD-PCP Interworking Function including the corresponding
   error cause (See Section 4.3).

   In case DeletePortMappingRange() is used, the IGD-PCP IWF undertakes
   a lookup on its local mapping table to retrieve individual mappings
   instantiated by the requested Control Point (i.e., authorization
   checks) and matching the signalled port range (i.e., the external
   port is within "StartPort" and "EndPort" arguments of
   DeletePortMappingRange()).  If no mapping is found, "730
   PortMappingNotFound" error code is sent to the UPnP Control Point
   (Figure 10).  If a set of mappings are found, the IGD-PCP IWF
   generates individual PCP MAP delete requests corresponding to these
   mappings (See the example shown in Figure 11).

      The IWF MAY send a positive answer to the requesting UPnP Control
      Point without waiting to receive all the answers from the PCP
      Server.  It is unlikely to encounter a problem in the PCP leg
      because the IWF has verified authorization rights and also the
      presence of the mapping in the local table.

   This example illustrates the exchanges that occur when the IWF
   receives DeletePortMappingRange().  In this example, only two
   mappings having the external port number in the 6000-6050 range are
   maintained in the local table.  The IWF issues two MAP requests to
   delete these mappings.

7.  Security Considerations

   IGD:2 authorization framework SHOULD be used.  When only IGD:1 is
   available, one MAY consider to enforce the default security, i.e.,
   operation on the behalf of a third party is not allowed.

   This document defines a procedure to instruct PCP mappings for third
   party devices belonging to the same subscriber.  Identification means
   to avoid a malicious user to instruct mappings on behalf of a third
   party must be enabled.  Such means are already discussed in Section
   7.4.4 of [I-D.ietf-pcp-base].

   Security considerations elaborated in [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] and
   [Sec_DCP] should be taken into account.
