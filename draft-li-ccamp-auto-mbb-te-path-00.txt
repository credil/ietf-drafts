  IGP Extensions for Automatic Computation of MPLS Traffic Engineering
            Path Using Traffic Engineering Layers and Areas

Abstract

   As the network scale expands, especially in the mobile backhaul
   network, automatic computation of MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) path
   becomes very important.  But owing to requirements on the MPLS TE
   path, explicit path or affinity property has to be introduced for the
   path computation.  This causes the complexity of MPLS TE path design.
   The document proposes an architecture and corresponding OSPF and ISIS
   extensions to improve automation on computation of MPLS TE path.
   MPLS TE networks are divided into different traffic engineering
   layers and areas according to the characteristics of the network
   topology.  MPLS TE path can compute automatically based on traffic
   engineering layers and areas to satisfy major requirements to bear
   mobile network services.

Internet-Draft   OSPF for Auto TE Path Using TLs and TAs  September 2013


   As the network scale expands, especially in the mobile backhaul
   network, automatic computation of MPLS TE path becomes very important
   ([I-D.li-mpls-seamless-mpls-mbb]).  Since the mobile traffic has high
   SLA (Service Level Agreement) requirement, MPLS TE is introduced to
   provide bandwidth guarantee and traffic protection.  On the other
   hand, in order to provide traffic engineering properties, constraints
   such as explicit path or affinity property has to be specified for a
   MPLS TE tunnel.  This causes that the path design is very complex.
   For example, when explicit path is specified for a MPLS TE tunnel in
   a large scale network, many hops along the MPLS TE path have to be
   specified.  This operation is cumbersome and error-prone.  In
   addition, if new nodes are introduced in the network, a lot of
   configuration of existing explicit paths has to be changed.

   This document proposes an architecture and corresponding OSPF and
   ISIS extensions to improve automation on computation of MPLS TE path.
   MPLS TE layers and areas are introduced according to the
   characteristics of the network topology.  MPLS TE path can compute
   more automatically based on MPLS TE layers and areas to reduce the
   operation expense greatly.

2.  Problem Statement

2.1.  Mobile Backhaul Network and Service Deployment

   Mobile multimedia devices such as smartphones are ubiquitous now
   which runs a wide variety of bandwidth-intensive applications and
   causes unprecedented growth in mobile data traffic.  The huge growth
   is challenging legacy network infrastructure.  There are two obvious
   solutions to cope with the growing bandwidth:

   -- Increase the radio wireless interface bandwidth

   -- Increase more cell sites: more LTE eNodeBs and associated Cell
   Site Gateways(CSGs) are added in the networks.  This causes the
   network scale expands fast and has much effect on the service
   provision.

                    Figure 1 Mobile Backhaul Network


   The topology of mobile backhaul network is shown in the Figure 1.  It
   usually adopts ring topology to save fiber resource and it is divided
   into the aggregate network and the access network.  Cell Site
   Gateways(CSGs) connect the eNodeBs and RNC site gateways(RSGs)
   connect the RNCs.  The mobile traffic is transported from CSGs to
   RSGs.  The network takes a typical aggregate traffic model that more
   than one access rings will attach to one pair of aggregate site
   gateways(ASGs) and more than one aggregate rings will attach to one
   pair of RSGs.

2.2.  Weakness of Existing MPLS TE Path Computation

   Since the mobile traffic has high SLA (Service Level Agreement)
   requirement, MPLS TE is introduced to provide bandwidth guarantee and
   traffic protection.  As the network scale expands, automation becomes
   more and more important to reduce the effort of service provision.
   But the path design becomes complex inevitably owing to guarantee
   traffic engineering properties.  There are following two primary
   requirements for MPLS TE path computation:

   1.  Completely disjointed primary and backup LSP

   MPLS TE Hot-standby feature is introduced to implement traffic
   protection.  That is, primary LSP and backup LSP are setup at the
   same time for one MPLS TE tunnel.  In order to achieve higher
   protection, it requires that the primary and backup LSP should not
   share any nodes and links.  Thus when a failure happens on the
   primary path, the backup LSP can always take over the traffic.

   According to current SPF(Shortest Path First) algorithm, if there is
   no other constraints, it may be difficult to satisfy above path

   computation requirement.  For example, in figure 1 the primary path
   computed from CSG1 to RSG1 may be CSG1->ASG2->ASG1->RSG1.  Since the
   primary path passes through both ASG2 and ASG1, the backup path
   cannot be disjointed completely from the primary path.  In fact, it
   is apparent that the two completely disjointed paths exists from CSG1
   to RSG1 in the figure 1.

   2.  Avoid passing through different access rings

   When the mobile traffic is transported from the CSG to the RSG, it is
   expected that the path would not pass through multiple access rings.
   Since the bandwidth of the access ring is always designed to satisfy
   requirement of its own, if mobile traffic from other access ring pass
   through, the access ring is prone to be overloaded which will cause
   traffic loss owing to traffic congestion.

   When automatic path computation is done for MPLS TE tunnels, it may
   be inevitable that the path will path through multiple access rings.
   For example, in figure 1 the primary path computed from CSG1 to RSG2
   may be CSG1->ASG2->CSG2->ASG3->RSG2 instead of
   CSG1->ASG2->ASG3->RSG2.

   There are two possible solutions to satisfy requirements described
   above:

   The first one is to set reasonable link cost.  For example, the cost
   of the key link between ASG1 and ASG2 can be set as a large value,
   then the primary LSP will not be calculated to pass through the key
   link and the backup LSP can be disjointed from the primary LSP
   completely.  The cost of the access ring can also be larger than the
   aggregate ring to avoid that the traffic will pass through unexpected
   rings.

   The second one is to use explicit-path or affinity property to
   achieve better path design.  When explicit path is used, it has to
   designate the exact nodes or links which the primary LSP and the
   backup LSP go through.  When affinity property is used, it can divide
   different rings with different colors and the primary LSP and backup
   LSP can setup with different affinity property.

   The two methods can satisfy the two requirements of path computation.
   But as we know the mobile backhaul network faces more frequent
   topology change than the fixed network.  Adding and deleting of
   eNodeB will change the access ring topology and which will change the
   hops and cost for mobile traffic from the source to the destination.
   It will be very complex and time-consuming to adjust the cost for a
   large scale network or change explicit path or affinity property for
   a great deal of MPLS TE tunnels.  It is necessary to propose a more
   automatic way to satisfy the requirements.

                Figure 2 Definition of TAs and TLs


   New network constraints are introduced to improve automation of MPLS
   TE path computation, As the figure above shows, the mobile backhaul
   network can be divided into multiple layers and multiple areas.  The
   layers and areas can be designated easily according to the natural
   physical topology.  We propose two concepts below:

   o  TE Layer (TL): It indicates the physical layer of the node in the
      network.  The TL value should be increased from the access ring to
      the aggregate ring layer by layer.  The TL values from the access
      ring to the aggregate ring can be not continuous.  They just
      reflect the relation of the different layers.  In order to
      accommodate future network expansion, it is better that the lowest
      TL value should not start from the 0 or 1.

   o  TE Area(TA): It indicates the physical ring of the node.  All
      nodes of the physical ring forms a natural area.  TA value must be
      unique in the whole network.  TA is designed mostly according to
      the physical topology with the aim to separate the obvious
      physical areas.  One node can have multiple TA values when it
      belongs to multiple rings.

   TL and TA are defined for every node instead of every link to reduce
   the effort of configuration and operation.  TA and TL indicates the
   network layer and area which one node belongs to.  TL and TA value
   should be set for the node before the path of the TE LSP is
   calculated just like that the cost of the link should be set before
   the routes are calculated.  TL and TA are only defined for MPLS TE
   path computation according to the natural topology of the mobile
   network.  They have no relationship with IGP area or level.

3.2.  TL and TA Information Flooding

   After the TL and TA value are set for the node, the TL and TA
   information of this node should be flooded through IGP.  When all
   nodes TL and TA information are flooded, every node in this route
   region will have the whole TL and TA information which will be added
   to the TEDB for TE LSP calculation.  When a TE LSP requires path
   computation in a source node , a new enhanced CSPF algorithm based on
   TL and TA will be used to calculate the optimal path automatically.

3.3.  Enhanced CSPF Algorithm Based on TL and TA

   The enhanced CSPF algorithm based on TL and TA can calculate the TE
   path more automatically comparing with the existing CSPF algorithm.
   In order to achieve more automatic path computation, some new rules
   are introduced for the CSPF algorithm.

   We assume that:

   o  The high layer is TL high(TLh), the low layer is TL low(TLl);

   o  The source node of the LSP has the TA value TAs, the destination
      node of LSP has the TA value TAd, the passed node has the TA value
      TAp.

   The rules for the enhanced CSPF algorithm are as follows:

   o  Rule 1: If the destination node of the LSP is not in the same TA
      as the source node or the passed node, the node in the different
      layer will be the potential next-hop for the LSP path calculation.

   o  Rule 2: One LSP's TL track can not include TLh->TLl->TLh, this
      means that the LSP cannot pass through the low layer twice.

   o  Rule 3: If the LSP reach a node that in the same TA as the
      destination node, the LSP must be calculated in this TA only.

   o  Rule 4: If the LSP reach a node that among more than one TAs, the
      node in different TA should be prior to be the next hop.  This
      rule ensures that the primary and backup LSPs would not pass the
      same links.

   Since these rules are applied to calculate both the primary and
   secondary path automatically, rules for determining which is the
   primary or the secondary should also be introduced.  The rules are as
   follows:

   o  Rule 5: The LSP which passes fewer TLs will be the primary LSP.

   o  Rule 6: If the two LSPs passes the same TLs, the one with shorter
      metric in every layer from high to low will be the main LSP

3.3.1.  An Example of Enhanced CSPF Algorithm Based on TL and TA

   As the figure above shows, the TL and TA values are designed for
   every node and the flooding has completed.  Now the primary LSP and
   the backup LSPp should setup from the source node(1.1.1.1) to the
   destination node(10.10.10.10), the path calculation is as follows:

   1.  The source node(192.168.1.1) is TL1TA1 and the destination
       node(192.168.10.1) is TL3TA0.  The LSP path should be calculated
       towards the node with higher TL value in TA1, according to Rule 1
       . The candidate nodes are NodeA and NodeB and we assume that the
       algorithm will choose NodeB as the next hop according to the
       cost.

   2.  After get NodeB, there are three candidate nodes for the next hop
       which are NodeA and NodeE and NodeH.  Node H will be excluded
       according to Rule 2, because it will cause the LSP to passe
       through TL2->TL1->TL2, that means the LSP will pass another
       access ring which is on the same low layer as the source node.

   3.  NodeB is in TA0, which is the same as the destination node, so we
       can only choose NodeA or Node E, according to Rule 3

   4.  TA1 has been passed, so the NodeB in TA1 is exclued according to
       rule4

   5.  Node E is the best appropriate choice according to the Rules.As a
       result ,we can get a path NodeF->NodeB->NodeE->NodeD

   6.  The other path is calculated according to the rules with the
       nodes and links passed by the first path excluded.  So we can get
       the other path NodeF->NodeA->NodeC->NodeD.

   7.  Then we will select the primary path from these two paths.
       According to the rule5 and rule6, the path
       NodeF->NodeA->NodeC->NodeD is determined as the primary LSP and
       the path NodeF->NodeB->NodeE->NodeD is the backup LSP.

4.  IGP Extensions

   We define an enhanced CSPF algorithms based on TE layers and TE areas
   to satisfy the path calculation requirements described above.  Before
   the path calculation, TL and TA information of the node should be
   flooded through IGPs.  This document also specifies IGP (OSPF and IS-
   IS) TE Area and TE Layer TLVs (Type Length Value) allowing for the
   automatic discovery of the TE Area and TE Layer of a node, to be
   carried in the OSPF Router Information (Link State Advertisement) LSA
   [RFC4970] and IS-IS Router Capability TLV [RFC4971].  The routing
   extensions specified in this document provide the ability to signal
   multiple TE Area and TE Layer values.

   There are relatively tight real-time constraints on the operation of
   IGPs (such as OSPF and IS-IS).  For this reason, some care needs to
   be taken when extend to carry additional information in an IGP.  The
   information described in this document is relatively small in total

   volume (compared with other information already carried in IGPs), and
   also relatively stable (i.e., changes are based on configuration
   changes, but not on dynamic events within the network, or on dynamic
   triggers such as the leaking of information from other routing
   protocols or routing protocol instances).

4.1.  OSPF Extensions

4.1.1.  OSPF TA TLV and TL TLV Format

   The OSPF TA TLV and TL TLV are used to advertise the TA and TL a node
   belongs to.  The OSPF TA TLV and TL TLV are advertised in an OSPF
   router information LSA defined in [RFC4970]) has the following
   format:

4.1.2.  Elements of Procedure

   The OSPF TA and TL TLV is carried within the OSPF Routing Information
   LSA.  Specifically, a router MUST originate a new LSA whenever the
   content of this information changes, or whenever required by regular
   routing procedure (e.g., updates).  The OSPF TLVs are OPTIONAL and
   MUST NOT included more than one instance.  If either of the TLVs
   occurs more than once within the OSPF Router Information LSA, only
   the first instance is processed and subsequent TLV(s) SHOULD be
   silently ignored.

   When the TA or TL of a node changes, a new router information LSA
   SHOULD be advertised.  The flood scope is OSPF Area using type 10 LSA
   or Routing-domain scope using type 11 LSA.

   As defined in [RFC5250] for OSPFv2 and in [RFC5340]for OSPFv3, the
   flooding scope of the Router Information LSA is determined by the LSA
   Opaque type for OSPFv2 and the values of the S1/S2 bits for OSPFv3.

   The TA TLV and TL TLV may be advertised within an Area-local or
   Routing-domain scope Router Information LSA, depending on the MPLS TE
   profile:

   - If the MPLS TE Area and Layer are contained within a single area,
   the TA TLV and TL TLV MUST be generated within an Area-local Router
   Information LSA.

   - If the MPLS TE Area and Layer spans multiple OSPF areas, the TA TLV
   and TL TLV MUST be generated within a Routing-domain scope router
   information LSA.

4.1.3.  Backward Compatibility

   The OSPF TLVs defined in this document do not introduce any
   interoperability issue.  A router not supporting the TLV SHOULD just
   silently ignore the TLV as specified in [RFC5250].

4.2.  IS-IS Extensions

4.2.1.  IS-IS TA TLV and TL TLV Format

   The IS-IS TA sub-TLV and TL sub-TLV are used to advertise the TA and
   TL a node belongs to.  The IS-IS TA sub-TLV and TL sub-TLV are
   advertised in IS-IS Router Capability TLV [RFC4971]).

   The IS-IS TA sub-TLV and TL sub-TLV are composed of 1 octet for the
   type, 1 octet specifying the TLV length and a value field.  The
   format of the IS-IS TA sub-TLV and TL sub-TLV for IPv4 and IPv6 are
   as follows:

   Sub-TLV:

        Figure 4 IS-IS TE-Area sub-TLV and TE-Layer sub-TLV format


4.2.2.  Elements of Procedure

   The IS-IS TE-Area TLV and TE-Layer TLV are advertised within the IS-
   IS Router CAPABILITY TLV defined in [RFC4971].  An IS-IS router MUST
   originate a new IS-IS LSP whenever the content of any of the
   advertised sub-TLV changes or whenever required by regular IS-IS
   procedure (LSP updates).  If an LSR desires to join or leave a
   particular TE-Area or TE-Layer, it MUST originate a new LSP
   comprising the refreshed IS-IS Router capability TLV with the updated
   TE-Area sub-TLV and TE-Layer sub-TLV.

   As specified in [RFC4971], a router may generate multiple IS-IS
   Router CAPABILITY TLVs within an IS-IS LSP with different flooding
   scopes.  If the flooding scope of a TE-Area sub-TLV and TE-Layer sub-
   TLV is limited to an IS-IS level, the sub-TLV MUST NOT be leaked
   across level and the S flag of the Router CAPABILITY TLV MUST be
   cleared.  If the flooding scope of a TE-Area sub-TLV and TE-Layer
   sub-TLV is the entire routing domain, the TLV MUST be leaked across
   IS-IS levels, and the S flag of the Router CAPABILITY TLV MUST be
   set.  In both cases, the flooding rules specified in [RFC4971] apply.

4.2.3.  Backward Compatibility

   The IS-IS sub-TLVs defined in this document do not introduce any
   interoperability issue.  A router which does not support the sub-TLVs
   SHOULD just silently ignore the sub-TLV as specified in [RFC6823].
