        The framework for preparation and comparison of internationalized strings ("PRECIS")

<!-- NOTE FROM PETER: I prefer PRECIS in all caps. :-)  -->
<!-- NOTE FROM NEMO: I modified them. :) -->

        defines
        several classes of strings for preparation and comparison.  In the
        framework, case mapping is defined because many protocols handle 
        case-sensitive or case-insensitive string comparison and therefore
        preparation of the string is mandatory.  As described in the mapping 
        for Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) and the PRECIS problem statement,
        mappings for 
        internationalized strings are not limited to case, but also width mapping and mapping of  
        delimiters and other specials can be taken into consideration.
        This document provides guidelines for authors of protocol profiles of the PRECIS framework
        and describes several mappings that can be applied between receiving user input and passing
        permitted code points to internationalized protocols.
        <!-- The mappings described here are expected to be applied before the rules specified in the PRECIS framework. -->
        The mappings described here are expected to be applied as Additional mapping in the PRECIS framework.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        In many cases, user input of internationalized strings is generated
        through the use of an input method editor ("IME") or through copy-and-paste from free text.
        Users in general do not care about the case and/or width of input characters because they consider those
        characters to be functionally equivalent or visually identical. Furthermore, users rarely
        switch IME state to input special characters such as protocol
        elements.  For Internationalized Domain Names ("IDNs"), the IDNA Mapping
        specification <xref target="RFC5895"/> describes methods for handling these issues. 
        For PRECIS strings, case mapping and width mapping are defined in the PRECIS
        framework specification <xref target="I-D.ietf-precis-framework"/>, but 
        delimiter mapping, special mapping, and language dependent mapping are not defined.
        Handling of mappings other than case and width is also important to increase chance of
        strings match as users expect.
        This document provides guidelines for authors of protocol profiles of the PRECIS framework
        and describes mappings that can be applied 
        between receiving user input and passing permitted code points to
        internationalized protocols.
        <!-- The mappings described here are expected to be applied before the rules specified in the PRECIS framework. -->
        The mappings described in this document are expected to be applied as Additional mapping in the PRECIS framework.

<!-- NOTE FROM PETER: As I described in my message to the mailing list, I don't think we need the sections "Types of mapping" and "Protocol independent mapping" because width mapping is now described in the framework.

    <section title="Types of mapping" anchor="type">
      <t>
        This document defines two types of mapping. One is protocol independent mapping
        that doesn't depend on protocol rules and the other is protocol dependent mapping that depend on protocol rules.
        This document defines some mappings in these mapping types. 
        Authors of protocol profiles of PRECIS framework should need to give careful consideration to choice of mappings.
      </t>
      <t>
        Each mapping type is described in following sections.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Protocol independent mapping" anchor="pim">
      <t>
        Protocol independent mapping is a mapping that doesn't depend on protocol rules.
      </t>
      <section title="Width mapping">
        <t>
          Fullwidth and halfwidth characters (those defined with
          Decomposition Types &lt;wide&gt; and &lt;narrow&gt;) are mapped to
          their decomposition mappings as shown in the Unicode character
          database <xref target="Unicode"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Width mapping will increase backward compatibility with Stringprep
          <xref target="RFC3454"/> and PRECIS framework 
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-precis-framework"/>.  Because in a
          Stringprep profile which specifies Unicode normalization form KC
          (NFKC) for normalization method, fullwidth/halfwidth characters
          are mapped into its compatible form.  If a PRECIS framework
          profile specified NFKC (which is not recommended), width mapping
          might not be useful.

    <section title="Protocol dependent mappings" anchor="pdm">
      <t>
        The PRECIS framework defines several protocol-independent mappings.
        The additional mappings defined in this document are protocol-dependent,
        i.e., they depend on the rules for a particular application protocol.
      </t>
      <section title="Delimiter mapping">
        <t>
          Some application protocols define delimiters for use in such protocols,
          but the delimiters are different for each protocols. 
          Therefore, the delimiter mapping table should be based on a
          well-defined mapping table for each protocol.
        </t>
        <t>
        <!-- NOTE FROM NEMO: I added from -->
        <!--
          Delimiter mapping is supposed for width compatible characters 
          that like '@' in mail address and ':' or '/' in URI.
          Also Delimiter mapping is supposed for there may be protocols that use '+', '-', '' or '' as delimiters in the future.

          For example, the FULL STOP
          character (U+002E) is a delimiter in the visual presentation of a domain name.  Some 
          IMEs generate a FULL STOP compatible character such as IDEOGRAPHIC
          FULL STOP (U+3002) when a user types FULL STOP on the keyboard.  Therefore, such
          a character needs to be mapped to the FULL STOP character before passing the
          string to the protocol.
        -->
          Delimiter mapping is supposed to map delimiter characters that have 
          compatible characters to canonical characters.  For example, '@' in mail 
          address or ':' and '/' in URI has width compatible character.  And '+', 
          &apos;-&apos;, &apos;&lt;&apos; and &apos;&gt;&apos; may be such character.  Another example is the FULL STOP
          character (U+002E) which is a delimiter in the visual presentation of 
          domain names. Some IMEs generate semantic or width compatible character 
          of FULL STOP such as IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP (U+3002) when a user types FULL 
          STOP on the keyboard.  Such FULL STOP compatible characters need to be mapped 
          to the FULL STOP before passing the string to the protocol.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Special mapping" anchor="spm"> 
        <t>
          Aside from delimiter characters, certain protocols have characters which need to be mapped in ways that are different from the rules specified in the PRECIS framework (e.g., mapping non-ASCII space characters to ASCII space).
          In this document, these mappings are called "special mappings". They are different for each protocol.
          Therefore, the special mapping table should be based on a well-defined mapping table for each protocol.          
          Examples of special mapping are the following;
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>White spaces are mapped to SPACE (U+0020)</t>
            <t>Some characters such as control characters are mapped to nothing (Deletion)</t>
          </list>
          As examples, EAP <xref target="RFC3748"/>, SASLprep <xref target="RFC4013"/>, IMAP4 ACL <xref target="RFC4314"/> and LDAPprep <xref target="RFC4518"/>
          define the rule that some codepoints for non-ASCII space are mapped to SPACE (U+0020).
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Local case mapping" anchor="lcm">
        <t>
          The purpose of local case mapping is to increase the probability 
          of matching-result from the comparison between uppercase and 
          lowercase characters, targeting locale and locale and context-dependent characters.
        </t>
        <t>
          As an example of
          locale and context-dependent mapping, LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049) is
          normally mapped to LATIN SMALL LETTER I ((U+0069); however, if the
          language is Turkish (or one of several other languages), unless an I is before a dot_above, then the
          character should be mapped to LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I (U+0131).
        </t>
        <!--t>
          Local case mapping depends on locale or context.  As an example of
          locale-dependent mapping, LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049) is
          normally mapped to LATIN SMALL LETTER I ((U+0069); however, if the
          language is Turkish (or one of several other languages), then the
          character should be mapped to LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I (U+0131).
          As an example of context-dependent mapping, GREEK CAPITAL LETTER
          SIGMA (U+03A3) is mapped to GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA (U+03C3) if it
          is followed by another letter, but is mapped to GREEK SMALL LETTER
          FINAL SIGMA (U+03C2) if it is not followed by another letter.
        </t-->
        <!--t>
          Local case mapping is case folding that depends on language and context.
          For example, the mapping of LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049) depends on the
          language context of the user: if the language is Turkish (or one of several other languages), the character should be mapped into LATIN SMALL
          LETTER DOTLESS I (U+0131) as this character's lower case equivalent.
        </t-->
        <t>
          To solve such problems for PRECIS framework,
          this document defines characters that need local case mapping based on
          the SpecialCasing.txt <xref target="Specialcasing"/> file in section 3.13
          of The Unicode Standard <xref target="Unicode"/>.
        </t>
        <!--t>
          Local case mapping targets only characters that get two different results to perform just casefolding
          that is defined in the Casefolding.txt <xref target="Casefolding"/> and perform special casefolding
          that is defined in the SpecialCasing.txt then casefolding, because PRECIS framework have casefolding.
        </t>
        <t>
          There are two types casefoldings defined as Unconditional Mappings and Conditional Mappings in the SpecialCasing.txt file.
          Conditional mappings have Language-Insensitive Mappings that target characters whose full case mappings do not depend on language, but do
          depend on context.  Language-Sensitive Mappings that these are characters whose full case mappings depend on language and perhaps also
          context.
        </t>
        <t>
          Of these mappings, characters with Unconditional Mappings or with Language-Insensitive Mappings in Conditional Mappings target are mapped into
          same codepoint(s) with just casefolding or special casefolding then casefolding.
          But characters with Language-Sensitive Mappings in Conditional Mappings targets are mapped into different codepoints.
          Therefore this document defines characters that are a part of characters of Lithuanian(lt), Turkish(tr) and Azerbaijanian(az) that Language-Sensitive Mappings targets
          as targets for local case mapping.
        </t-->
        <t>
          The following are the methods to calculate codepoints that local case mapping targets.
          Here Casefolding() means full casefolding described in the CaseFolding.txt file <xref target="Casefolding"/>,
          and Specialcasing() means specialcasing described in the SpecialCasing.txt file <xref target="Specialcasing"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          If Casefolding(Specialcasing(cp)) != Casefolding(cp)<vspace/>
          Then cp is a target<vspace/>
          Else cp is not a target;<vspace/>
        </t>
<!-- NOTE FROM NEMO: I added a sentence for developers-->
        <t>
          Local case mapping can be selected only when case mapping is selected using the PRECIS Framework profile.
          Application developers should calculate codepoints that local case mapping targets by using the latest Casefolding.txt and SpecialCasing.txt.
          <xref target="LCM-list"/> "Code points list for local case mapping" lists codepoints in Unicode 6.3 calculated by this method.

            Some protocols requires local case mapping as normative of the PRECIS framework.
            Is it necessary to define the local case mapping in the framework document?
            Issue here is that the local case mapping is for localizaion and the PRECIS 
            framework is for internationalization.  Following to IDNA2008, PRECIS core 
            protocol should concentrate to internationalization, and localization should 
            be separated from the core protocol (like this document).
