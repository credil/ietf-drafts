    <abstract>
      <t>After an emergency call is completed (either prematurely terminated
      by the emergency caller or normally by the call taker) it is possible
      that the call taker feels the need for further communication. 
      For example, the call may have been dropped by accident
      without the call taker having sufficient information about the current
      situation of a wounded person. A call taker may trigger a callback
      towards the emergency caller using the contact information provided with
      the initial emergency call. This callback could, under certain
      circumstances, be treated like any other call and as a consequence
      it may get blocked by authorization policies or may get forwarded to an
      answering machine.</t>

      <t>The IETF emergency services architecture specification already 
      offers a solution approach for allowing PSAP callbacks to 
      bypass authorization policies to reach the caller without
      unnecessary delays. Unfortunately, the specified mechanism only supports limited scenarios. This document
      discusses shortcomings of the current mechanisms and illustrates additional scenarios where better-than-normal
      call treatment behavior would be desirable.</t>
      
      <t>Note that this version of the document does not yet specify a solution due to the lack of the working group 
      participants agreeing on the requirements.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>Summoning police, the fire department or an ambulance in emergencies
      is one of the fundamental and most-valued functions of the telephone. As
      telephone functionality moves from circuit-switched telephony to
      Internet telephony, its users rightfully expect that this core
      functionality will continue to work at least as well as it has for the
      legacy technology. New devices and services are being made available
      that could be used to make a request for help, which are not traditional
      telephones, and users are increasingly expecting them to be used to
      place emergency calls.</t>

      <t>An overview of the protocol interactions for emergency calling using the IETF emergency services architecture are described in <xref target="RFC6444"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp"/> specifies the technical details. As part of the emergency call setup procedure two important identifiers are conveyed to the PSAP call taker's user agent, namely the Address-Of-Record (AoR), and, if available, the Globally Routable User Agent (UA) URIs (GRUU). RFC 3261 <xref target="RFC3261"/> defines the AoR as: 
<list style="empty"> 
<t>      
         'An address-of-record (AOR) is a SIP or SIPS URI
         that points to a domain with a location service that can map
         the URI to another URI where the user might be available.
         Typically, the location service is populated through
         registrations.  An AOR is frequently thought of as the "public
         address" of the user.'
</t>
</list> 
</t>
<t>
   In SIP systems a single user can have a number of user agents (handsets,
   softphones, voicemail accounts, etc.) which are all referenced by the
   same AOR.  There are a number of cases in which it is desirable to
   have an identifier which addresses a single user agent rather than
   the group of user agents indicated by an AOR. The GRUU is such a unique user-
   agent identifier, which is still globally routable. RFC 5627 <xref target="RFC5627"/> specifies how to obtain and use GRUUs.
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp"/> also makes use of the GRUU for emergency calls.
</t>
      
<t>Regulatory requirements demand that the emergency call setup procedure itself 
provides enough information to allow the call taker to initiate a call back to the 
emergency caller. This is desirable in those cases where the call got dropped 
prematurely or when further communication need arises. 
The AoR and the GRUU serve this purpose.</t>
<t>The communication attempt by the PSAP call taker back to the emergency caller is called 'PSAP callback'. 
</t> 

<t>A PSAP callback may, 
      however,
      be blocked by user configured authorization policies or may be forwarded to an answering machine since SIP entities (SIP
      proxies as well as the SIP user equipment itself) cannot differentiate the PSAP callback from any other SIP call.
      "Call barring", "do not disturb", or "call diversion"(aka call forwarding) are features that prevent delivery of a call. It is important to note that these features may be implemented by SIP intermediaries as well as by the user agent. </t>

      <t>Among the emergency services community there is the desire to offer PSAP callbacks a treatment such that chances are 
      increased that it reaches the emergency caller. At the same time a design must deal with the negative side-effects of allowing certain calls to bypass call forwarding or other authorization policies. Ideally, the PSAP callback has to relate to an earlier emergency call that was made "not too long ago". An exact time interval is difficult to define in a global IETF standard due to the variety of national regulatory requirements.</t> 
      
      <t>To nevertheless meet the needs from the emergency services community a basic mechanism for preferential treatment of PSAP callbacks was defined in Section 13 of <xref
      target="RFC6444"></xref>. The specification says:</t>

      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>'A UA may be able to determine a PSAP call back by examining the
          domain of incoming calls after placing an emergency call and
          comparing that to the domain of the answering PSAP from the
          emergency call. Any call from the same domain and directed to the
          supplied Contact header or AoR after an emergency call should be
          accepted as a callback from the PSAP if it occurs within a
          reasonable time after an emergency call was placed.'</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This approach mimics a stateful packet filtering firewall and is
      indeed helpful in a number of cases. It is also relatively simple to
      implement even though it requires state to be maintained by the user agent as well as by SIP intermediaries. Unfortunately, the solution does not work in all deployment scenarios. 
      In <xref target="scenarios"/> we describe cases where the currently 
      standardized approach is insufficient.</t>
      
      <t><!-- In <xref target="solution"/> a solution is described. -->

     <t>This section illustrates a number of scenarios where the currently specified solution, as specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp"/>, for preferential treatment of callbacks fails. As explained in <xref target="intro"/> a SIP entity examines an incoming PSAP call back by comparing the domain of the PSAP with the destination domain of the emergency call.</t> 
     
      <section title="Routing Asymmetry">
        <t>In some deployment environments it is common to have incoming and
        outgoing SIP messaging routed through different SIP entities. <xref target="asymmetry"/> shows this graphically whereby a VoIP provider uses different SIP proxies for inbound and for outbound call handling. Unless they two devices are state synchronized the callback hitting the inbound proxy would get treated like any other call since the emergency call established state information at the outbound proxy only. </t>

      <section anchor="multistage" title="Multi-Stage Routing">
        <t>Consider the following emergency call routing scenario shown in
        <xref target="stages"></xref> where routing towards the PSAP occurs in
        several stages. In this scenario we consider a SIP UA that uses LoST to learn 
        the next hop destination closer to the PSAP. This call is then sent to the user's VoIP provider. 
        The user's VoIP provider
        receives the emergency call and creates state based on the destination domain, namely state.com. 
        It then routes it to the indicated ESRP. 
        When the ESRP receives it it needs to decide what the next hop is to get it closer to the PSAP. 
        In our example the next hop is the PSAP with the URI psap@town.com.</t>
        
        <t>When a callback is sent from psap@town.com towards the emergency caller the call 
        will get normal treatment by the VoIP providers inbound proxy since the domain of the PSAP 
        does not match the stored state information.</t>

      <section title="Call Forwarding">
        <t>Imagine the following case where an emergency call enters an
        emergency network (state.org) via an ERSP but then gets forwarded to a
        different emergency services network (in our example to
        police-town.org, fire-town.org or medic-town.org). The same
        considerations apply when the police, fire and ambulance networks
        are part of the state.org sub-domains (e.g., police.state.org).</t>
    
        <t>Similarly to the previous scenario the problem here is with the 
        wrong state information being established during the emergency call 
        setup procedure. A callback would originate in the police-town.org, fire-town.org or medic-town.org
        domain whereas the emergency caller's SIP UA or the VoIP outbound proxy has

    <section title="Security Considerations">
    
    <!-- 
    
      <t>This document defines a callback marking scheme.
      </t>

      <t>An important aspect from a security point of view is the relationship
      between the emergency services network and the VSP (assuming that the
      emergency call travels via the VSP and not directly between the SIP UA
      and the PSAP). If there is some form of relationship between the
      emergency services operator and the VSP then the identification of a
      PSAP call back is less problematic than in the case where the two
      entities have not entered in some form of relationship that would allow
      the VSP to verify whether the marked callback message indeed came from a
      legitimate source.</t>

      <t>The main attack surface can be seen in the usage of PSAP callback
      marking to bypass blacklists, ignore call forwarding procedures and
      similar features to interact with users and to get their attention. For
      example, using PSAP callback marking devices would be able to recognize
      these types of incoming messages leading to the device overriding user
      interface configurations, such as vibrate-only mode. As such, the
      requirement is to ensure that the mechanisms described in this document
      can not be used for malicious purposes, including SPIT.</t>

      <t>A SIP entity MAY treat the call as a normal incoming call if it
      considers the request with the included URI parameter to be fraudulent,
      i.e. if it does not recognize the originator, or the domain from where
      the call originated from as being trusted/owned by a PSAP. It is NOT
      RECOMMENDED to drop a call that is marked as PSAP callback in such a
      case since this may severely impact the ability for calltakers at PSAPs
      to contact emergency callers.</t>

      input: John Elwell, Bernard Aboba, Cullen Jennings, Keith Drage, Marc
      Linsner, Roger Marshall, Dan Romascanu, Geoff Thompson, Janet Gunn.</t>
      
      <t>At IETF#81 a small group of people got to together to continue the 
      discussions started at the working group meeting to explore a 
      GRUU-based solution approach. Martin Thomson, Marc Linsner, Andrew Allen, 
      Brian Rosen, Martin Dolly, and Atle Monrad participated at this 
      side-meeting.</t>

  <section title="Alternative Solutions Considered"> 
  
      <t>In an attempt to describe the problem and to explore solution approaches the 
      working group had also investigated alternative approaches. We document them here 
      for completeness. The solutions fall into three categories: (1) Identity-based authorization, 
      (2) Trait-based authorization, and (3) Call Marking. Even though these solutions are not 
      mutually exclusive we describe them in separate sub-sections.</t>
      
          <t>Beyond the disadvantages listed in each solution category none of them 
    provides the emergency caller with the ability to restrict preferential PSAP callback 
    handling to those cases where an earlier emergency call was initiated. </t>
    
      <section title="Identity-based Authorization"> 
      <t>In <xref target="identity-authz"></xref> an interaction is presented
      that allows a SIP entity to make a policy decision whether to bypass
      installed authorization policies and thereby providing preferential
      treatment. To make this decision the sender's identity is compared with
      a whitelist of valid PSAPs. The identity assurances in SIP can come in
      different forms, such as SIP Identity <xref target="RFC4474"></xref> or
      with P-Asserted-Identity <xref target="RFC3325"></xref>. The former
      technique relies on a cryptographic assurance and the latter on a chain
      of trust.</t>

      <t>This approach was not chosen because the establishment of a whitelist containing PSAP identities is
      operationally complex and does not easily scale world wide. Only when there
      is a local relationship between the VSP/ASP and the PSAP then populating
      the whitelist is far simpler. This would, however, constrain the applicability of the mechanism considerably.</t>

      <t>In a trait-based authorization scenario an incoming SIP message
      contains a form of trait, i.e. some form of assertion. The assertion
      contains an indication that the sending party has the role of a PSAP (or
      similar emergency services entity). The assertion is either
      cryptographically protected to enable end-to-end verification or an
      chain of trust security model has to be assumed. In <xref
      target="trait"></xref> we assume an end-to-end security model where
      trust anchors are provisioned to ensure the ability for a SIP entity to
      verify the received assertion.</t>
      
      <t>This solution was not chosen because trait-based authorization never got 
      deployed in SIP. Furthermore, in order to ensure that the assertions are 
      properly protected it is necessary to digitally sign, which requires some 
      form of public key infrastructure for usage with emergency services. 
      Finally, there need to be some policies in place that define which entities 
      are allowed to obtain various roles. These policies and procedures do not 
      exist today.</t>
      
    </section>

    <section title="Call Marking"> 
        <t>
        Call marking allows the PSAP to place a non-cryptographic label 
        on outgoing calls that gives, when received by a SIP entity, preferential 
        treatment for these callbacks. </t>
        
        <t>When used in isolation this mechanism introduces considerable denial of 
        service attacks due to the ability to bypass any authorization policies 
        and could be utilized to distribute unwanted traffic.</t>
