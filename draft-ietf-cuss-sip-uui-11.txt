 A Mechanism for Transporting User to User Call Control Information in
                                  SIP
                       draft-ietf-cuss-sip-uui-11

Abstract

   There is a class of applications which benefit from using SIP to
   exchange User to User Information (UUI) data during session
   establishment.  This information, known as call control UUI data, is
   a small piece of data inserted by an application initiating the
   session, and utilized by an application accepting the session.  The
   rules which apply for a specific application are defined by a UUI
   package.  This UUI data is opaque to SIP and its function is
   unrelated to any basic SIP function.  This document defines a new SIP
   header field, User-to-User, to transport UUI data, along with an
   extension mechanism.

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 October 2013


1.  Overview

   This document describes the transport of User to User Information
   (UUI) data using SIP [RFC3261].  A mechanism is defined for the
   transport of general application UUI data and for the transport of
   call control related ITU-T Q.931 User to User Information Element (UU
   IE) [Q931] and ITU-T Q.763 User to User Information Parameter [Q763]
   data in SIP.  UUI data is widely used in the PSTN today for contact
   centers and call centers.  There is also a trend for the related
   applications to transition from ISDN to SIP.  The UUI extension for
   SIP may also be used for native SIP UAs implementing similar services
   and to interwork with ISDN services.  Note that in most cases, there
   is an a priori understanding between the UAs in regard to what to do
   with received UUI data.

   This mechanism was designed to meet the use cases, requirements, and
   call flows for SIP call control UUI detailed in [RFC6567].  All
   references to requirement numbers (REQ-N) and figure numbers refer to
   this document.

   The mechanism is a new SIP header field, along with a new SIP option
   tag.  The header field carries the UUI data, along with parameters
   indicating the encoding of the UUI data, the UUI package, and
   optionally the content of the UUI data.  The package definition
   contains details about how a particular application can utilize the
   UUI mechanism.  The header field can be included (sometimes called
   "escaped") into URIs supporting referral and redirection scenarios.
   In these scenarios, History-Info is used to indicate the inserter of
   the UUI data.  The SIP option tag can be used to indicate support for
   the header field.  Support for the UUI header field indicates that a
   UA is able to extract the information in the UUI data and pass it up
   the protocol stack.  Individual packages using the UUI mechanism can
   utilize SIP media feature tags to indicate that a UA supports a
   particular UUI package.  Guidelines for defining UUI packages are
   provided.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Requirements Discussion

   This section describes how the User-to-User header field meets the



Johnston & Rafferty      Expires April 24, 2014                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 October 2013


   requirements in [RFC6567].  The header field can be included in
   INVITE requests and responses and BYE requests and responses, meeting
   REQ-1 and REQ-2.

   For redirection and referral use cases and REQ-3, the header field
   shall be included (escaped) into the Contact or Refer-To URI.
   Currently, UAs that support attended transfer support the ability to
   include a Replaces header field [RFC3891] into a Refer-To URI, and
   when acting upon this URI add the Replaces header field to the
   triggered INVITE.  This logic and behavior is identical for the UUI
   header field.  The UA processing the REFER or the 3xx to the INVITE
   will need to support the UUI mechanism, as UAs in general do not
   process unknown included header fields.

   Since SIP proxy forwarding and retargeting does not affect header
   fields, the header field meets REQ-4.

   The UUI header field will carry the UUI data and not a pointer to the
   data, so REQ-5 is met.

   Since the basic design of the UUI header field is similar to the ISDN
   UUI service, interworking with PSTN protocols is straightforward and
   is documented in a separate specification
   [I-D.ietf-cuss-sip-uui-isdn], meeting REQ-6.

   Requirements REQ-7, REQ-8, and REQ-10 relate to discovery of the
   mechanism and supported packages, and hence applications.  REQ-7
   relates to support of the UUI header field, while REQ-8 relates to
   routing based on support of the UUI header field.  REQ-7 is met by
   defining a new SIP option tag 'uui'.  The use of a Require:uui in a
   request, or Supported:uui in an OPTIONS response could be used to
   require or discover support of the mechanism.  The presence of a
   Supported:uui or Require:uui header field can be used by proxies to
   route to an appropriate UA, meeting REQ-8.  However, note that only
   UAs are expected to understand the UUI data - proxies and other
   intermediaries do not.  REQ-10 is met by utilizing SIP feature tags
   [RFC3840].  For example, the feature tag 'sip.uui-isdn' could be used
   to indicate support of the ISDN UUI package, or 'sip.uui-pk1' could
   be used to indicate support for a particular package, pk1.

   Proxies commonly apply policy to the presence of certain SIP header
   fields in requests by either passing them or removing them from
   requests.  REQ-9 is met by allowing proxies and other intermediaries
   to remove UUI header fields in a request or response based on policy.

   Carrying UUI data elements of at least 129 octets is trivial in the
   UUI header field, meeting REQ-11.  Note that very large UUI data
   elements should be avoided, as SIP header fields have traditionally



Johnston & Rafferty      Expires April 24, 2014                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 October 2013


   not been large.

   To meet REQ-12 for the redirection and referral use cases, History-
   Info [I-D.ietf-sipcore-rfc4244bis] can be used.  In these retargeting
   cases, the changed Request-URI will be recorded in the History-Info
   header field along with the identity of the element that performed
   the retargeting.

   The requirement for integrity protection in REQ-13 could be met by
   the use of an S/MIME signature over a subset of header fields, as
   defined in Section 23.4 of RFC 3261 "SIP Header Privacy and Integrity
   using S/MIME: Tunneling SIP".  The requirement of REQ-14 for end-to-
   end privacy could be met using S/MIME or using encryption at the
   application layer.  Note that the use of S/MIME to secure the UUI
   data will result in an additional body being added to the request.
   Hop-wise Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] allows the header
   field to meet REQ-15 for hop-by-hop security.


4.  Normative Definition

   This document defines a new SIP header field "User-to-User" to
   transport call control UUI data to meet the requirements in
   [RFC6567].

   To help tag and identify the UUI data used with this header field,
   "purpose", "content", and "encoding" header field parameters are
   defined.  The "purpose" header field parameter identifies the package
   which defines the generation and usage of the UUI data for a
   particular application.  For the case of interworking with the ISDN
   UUI Service, the ISDN UUI Service interworking package is used.  If
   the "purpose" header field parameter is not present, interworking
   with the ISDN UUI Service MUST be assumed.  The "content" header
   field parameter identifies the actual content of the UUI data.  If
   not present, the content MUST be assumed to be the default defined
   for the package.  Newly defined UUI packages MUST define or reference
   at least a default "content" value.  The "encoding" header field
   parameter indicates the method of encoding the information in the UUI
   data associated with a particular "content" value.  This
   specification only defines "encoding=hex".  If the "encoding" header
   field parameter is not present, the encoding MUST be assumed to be
   the default defined for the package.

   UUI data is considered an opaque series of octets.  This mechanism
   SHOULD NOT be used to convey a URL or URI; the Call-Info header field
   [RFC3261] is used for this purpose.

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 October 2013


4.1.  Syntax for UUI Header Field

   The User-to-User (UUI) header field can be present in INVITE requests
   and responses and in BYE requests and responses.  Note that when the
   UUI header is used in responses, it can only be utilized in end-to-
   end responses, e.g. 1xx (excluding 100), 2xx, and 3xx responses.

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC 5234 and extends RFC 3261 (where token
   and quoted-string are defined).

        UUI         = "User-to-User" HCOLON uui-value *(COMMA uui-value)
        uui-value   = uui-data *(SEMI uui-param)
        uui-data    = token / quoted-string
        uui-param   = pkg-param / cont-param / enc-param / generic-param
        pkg-param   = "purpose" EQUAL pkg-param-value
        pkg-param-value = token
        cont-param   = "content" EQUAL cont-param-value
        cont-param-value = token
        enc-param   = "content" EQUAL enc-param-value
        enc-param-value = token / "hex"


   The rules for how many User-to-User header fields of each package may
   be present in a request or a response are defined for each package.
   Multiple User-to-User header fields MAY be present in a request or
   response.  Consistent with the rules of SIP syntax, the syntax
   defined in this document allows any combination of individual User-
   to-User header fields or User-to-User header fields with multiple
   comma separated UUI data elements.  Any size limitations on the UUI
   data for a particular purpose must be defined by the related UUI
   package.

   UAs SHOULD ignore UUI data from packages or encoding that they do not
   understand.

   If an element supports this specification, it SHOULD include any UUI
   data included in a redirection URI (if the UUI data and encoding is
   understood).  Note that redirection can occur multiple times to a
   request.

   Here is an example of an included User-to-User header field from the
   redirection response F2 of Figure 2:

   <allOneLine>
   Contact: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com?User-to-User=
   56a390f3d2b7310023a2%3Bencoding%3Dhex%3Bpurpose%3Dfoo%3B
   content%3Dbar>

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 October 2013


   </allOneLine>

   The resulting INVITE F4 would contain:

 User-to-User: 56a390f3d2b7310023a2;encoding=hex;purpose=foo;content=bar

4.2.  Hex Encoding Definition

   This specification defines hex encoding of UUI data.  The value of
   "hex" for the "encoding" header field parameter is normatively
   defined in this section.  It is used to encode binary UUI data with a
   length that terminates at an octet boundary.  Each octet of binary
   data to be represented in the hex encoding MUST be mapped to two
   hexadecimal digits (represented by ASCII characters 0-9, A-F and
   a-f), each representing four bits within the octet.  The four bits
   appearing first in the binary UUI data MUST be mapped to the first
   hexadecimal digit and the four subsequent bits in the binary UUI data
   MUST be mapped to the second hexadecimal digit.  When mapping 4 bits
   to a hexadecimal digit, the bit appearing first in the binary UUI
   data shall be most significant.  Thus, Hex encoded UUI data must have
   an even number of hexadecimal digits, and MUST be considered invalid
   if it has an odd number.  Hex encoding is normally done as a token,
   although quoted-string is permitted, in which case the quotes MUST be
   ignored.

4.3.  Source Identity of UUI data

   It is important for the recipient of UUI data to know the identity of
   the UA that inserted the UUI data.  In a request without a History-
   Info [I-D.ietf-sipcore-rfc4244bis] header field, the identity of the
   entity which inserted the UUI data will be assumed to be the source
   of the SIP message.  For a SIP request, typically this is the UA
   identified by the URI in the From header field or a P-Asserted-
   Identity [RFC3325] header field.  In a request with a History-Info
   header field, the recipient needs to parse the Targeted-to-URIs
   present (hi-targeted-to-uri) to see if any included User-to-User
   header fields are present.  If an included User-to-User header field
   is present and matches the UUI data in the request, this indicates
   that redirection has taken place, resulting in the inclusion of UUI
   data in the request.  The inserter of the UUI data will be the UA
   identified by the Targeted-to-URI of the History-Info element prior
   to the element with the included UUI data.  In a response, the
   inserter of the UUI data will be the identity of the UA that
   generated the response.  Typically, this is the UA identified in the
   To header field of the response.  Note that any updates to this
   identity by use of the SIP Connected Identity extension [RFC4916] or
   others will update this information.

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 October 2013


   For an example of History-Info and redirection, consider Figure 2
   from [RFC6567] where the Originating UA is Carol, the Redirector Bob,
   and the Terminating UA Alice.  The INVITE F4 containing UUI data
   could be:

   INVITE sips:alice@example.com SIP/2.0
   Via: SIP/2.0/TLS lab.example.com:5061
    ;branch=z9hG4bKnashds9
   To: Bob <sips:bob@example.com>
   From: Carol <sips:carol@example.com>;tag=323sf33k2
   Call-ID: dfaosidfoiwe83ifkdf
   Max-Forwards: 70
   Contact: <sips:carol@lab.example.com>
   Supported: histinfo
   User-to-User: 342342ef34;encoding=hex
   History-Info: <sips:bob@example.com>;index=1
   <allOneLine>
   History-Info: <sips:alice@example.com?Reason=SIP%3Bcause%3D302
      &User-to-User=342342ef34%3Bencoding%3Dhex>;index=1.1;rc=1
   </allOneLine>

   Without the redirection captured in the History-Info, Alice would
   conclude the UUI data was inserted by Carol.  However, the History-
   Info containing UUI data (index=1.1) indicates that the inserter was
   Bob (index=1).

   Note that the <allOneLine> tag convention from SIP  Torture Test
   Messages [RFC4475] is used to show that there are no line breaks in
   the actual message syntax.

   To enable maintaining a record of the inserter identity of UUI data,
   UAs supporting this mechanism SHOULD support History-Info
   [I-D.ietf-sipcore-rfc4244bis] and include Supported: histinfo in all
   requests and responses.

   Border elements such as proxies or Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs)
   which anonymize a SIP URI in a History-Info header field SHOULD leave
   the corresponding User-to-User parameter, if present, and the
   corresponding User-to-User header field unchanged.  Border elements
   removing a History-Info header containing a User-to-User parameter
   SHOULD NOT drop the corresponding User-to-User header.  Otherwise,
   the UA consuming the UUI data may not be able at SIP level to
   identify the source of the UUI data.


5.  Guidelines for UUI Packages

   UUI packages defined using this SIP UUI mechanism MUST follow the



Johnston & Rafferty      Expires April 24, 2014                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 October 2013


   "RFC Required" guideline as defined in [RFC5226] and publish a
   standards track RFC which describes the usage.  Note that this
   mechanism is not suitable for the transport of arbitrary data between
   UAs.  The following guidelines are provided to help determine if this
   mechanism is appropriate or some other SIP mechanism should be used.
   The SIP UUI mechanism is applicable when all of the following
   conditions be met:

      1.  The information is generated and consumed by an application
      during session setup using SIP, but the application is not
      necessarily SIP aware.

      2.  The behavior of SIP entities that support it is not
      significantly changed (as discussed in Section 4 of [RFC5727]).

      3.  User Agents (UAs) are the generators and consumers of the UUI
      data.  Proxies and other intermediaries may route based on the
      presence of a User-to-User header field or a particular package
      tag but do not otherwise consume or generate the UUI data.

      4.  There are no overriding privacy issues associated with the
      information being transported (e.g., geolocation or emergency-
      related information are examples of inappropriate UUI data).

      5.  The UUI data is not being utilized for user-to-user Remote
      Procedure Call (RPC) calls.

   UUI packages define the semantics for a particular application usage
   of UUI data.  The content defines the syntax of the UUI data, while
   the encoding defines the encoding of the UUI data for the content.
   Each content is defined as a stream of octets, which allows multiple
   encodings of that content.  For example, packages may define:

      1.  The SIP methods and responses in which the UUI data may be
      present.

      2.  The maximum number of UUI data elements that may be inserted
      into a request or response.  (The default is one per encoding.)
      Note that a UA may still receive a request with more than this
      maximum number due to redirection.  The package must define how to
      handle this situation.

      3.  The default values for content and encoding if they are not
      present.  If the same UUI data may be inserted multiple times with
      different encodings, the packages must state this.  A package may
      support and define multiple contents and their associated
      encodings, and reuse contents defined by other packages.

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 October 2013


      4.  Any size limitations on the UUI data.  Size should be
      specified in terms of the octet stream output of the content,
      since the size of the resulting uui-data element will vary
      depending on the encoding scheme.

   A package MUST define a "purpose" header field value to identify the
   package in the coding.  A package MUST describe the new application
   which is utilizing the UUI data and provide some use case examples.
   The default "content" value MUST be defined or referenced in another
   document for the package.  Additional allowed contents MAY also be
   defined or referenced.  Any restrictions on the size of the UUI data
   MUST be described.  In addition, a package MAY define a Media Feature
   tag per RFC 3840 [RFC3840] to indicate support for this UUI package.
   For example, the media feature tag sip.uui-pk1 could be defined to
   indicate support for a UUI package named pk1.  The definition of a
   new SIP option tag solely to identify support for a UUI package is
   NOT RECOMMENDED unless there are additional SIP behaviors needed to
   implement this feature.

   For an example UUI package definition, see
   [I-D.ietf-cuss-sip-uui-isdn].

5.1.  Extensibility

   New "content" values MUST describe the semantics of the UUI data,
   valid encodings, and give some example use cases.  A previously
   defined UUI content value can be used in a new package.  In this
   case, the semantics and usage of the content by the new package is
   defined within the new package.  New UUI content types cannot be
   added to existing packages - instead, a new package would need to be
   defined.  New content values defined are added to the IANA registry
   with a standards track RFC, which needs to discuss the issues in this
   section.  If no new encoding value is defined for a content, the
   encoding defaults to "hex" as defined in this document.  In this
   case, the "hex" value will be explicitly stated via the encoding
   parameter as the encoding for the content.

   New "encoding" values associated with a new content MUST reference a
   specific encoding scheme (such as "hex" which is defined in this
   specification) or define the new encoding scheme.  A previously
   defined UUI encoding value can be used with a newly defined content.
   In this case, the usage of the encoding is defined by the content
   definition.  New UUI encodings cannot be added to existing contents -
   instead, a new content would need to be defined.  Newly defined
   encoding values are added to the IANA registry with a standards track
   RFC, which needs to discuss the issues in this section.

7.  Security Considerations

   User to user information can potentially carry sensitive information
   that might require privacy or integrity protection from third parties
   that may wish to read or modify the UUI data.  [RFC6567] describes
   three security models which may be applicable for the UUI mechanism.

   One model treats the SIP layer as untrusted and requires end-to-end
   integrity protection and/or encryption.  This model can be achieved
   by providing these security services at a layer above SIP.  In this
   case, applications are encouraged to use their own integrity
   mechanisms such as encrypting the UUI data before passing it to the
   SIP layer.

   The second approach is for the application to pass the UUI without
   any protection to the SIP layer and require the SIP layer to provide
   this security.  This approach is possible in theory, although its
   practical use would be extremely limited.  To preserve multi-hop or
   end-to-end confidentiality and integrity of UUI data, approaches
   using S/MIME or IPSec can be used, as discussed in the review of
   REQ-13 and REQ-14 in section 3 of this document.  However, the lack
   of deployment of these mechanisms means that applications cannot in
   general rely on them being present.

   The third model utilizes a trust domain and relies on perimeter
   security at the SIP layer.  This is the security model of the PSTN
   and ISDN where UUI is commonly used today.  This approach uses hop-
   by-hop security mechanisms and relies on border elements for
   filtering and application of policy.  Standard deployed SIP security
   mechanisms such as TLS transport, offer privacy and integrity
   protection properties on a hop-by-hop basis at the SIP layer.

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 October 2013


   If the UUI data was included by the UA originator of the SIP request
   or response, normal SIP mechanisms can be used to determine the
   identity of the inserter of the UUI data.  If the UUI data was
   included by a UA that was not the originator of the request, History-
   Info can be used to determine the identity of the inserter of the UUI
   data.  UAs can apply policy based on the origin of the UUI data using
   this information.  In short, the UUI data included in an INVITE can
   be trusted as much as the INVITE itself can be trusted.


8.  Appendix - Other Possible Mechanisms

   Two other possible mechanisms for transporting UUI data will be
   described: MIME body and URI parameter transport.

8.1.  Why INFO is Not Used

   Since the INFO method [RFC6086], was developed for ISUP interworking
   of user-to-user information, it might seem to be the logical choice
   here.  For non-call control user-to-user information, INFO can be
   utilized for end to end transport.  However, for transport of call
   control user-to-user information, INFO can not be used.  As the call
   flows in [RFC6567] show, the information is related to an attempt to
   establish a session and must be passed with the session setup request
   (INVITE), responses to that INVITE, or session termination requests.
   As a result, it is not possible to use INFO in these cases.

8.2.  Why Other Protocol Encapsulation UUI Mechanisms are Not Used

   Other protocols have the ability to transport UUI data.  For example,
   consider the ITU-T Q.931 User to User Information Element (UU IE)
   [Q931] and the ITU-T Q.763 User to User Information Parameter [Q763].
   In addition, NSS (Narrowband Signaling System) [Q1980] is also able
   to transport UUI data.  Should one of these protocols be in use, and
   present in both User Agents, then utilizing these other protocols to
   transport UUI data might be a logical solution.  Essentially, this is
   just adding an additional layer in the protocol stack.  In these
   cases, SIP is not transporting the UUI data; it is encapsulating
   another protocol, and that protocol is transporting the UUI data.
   Once a mechanism to transport that other protocol using SIP exists,
   the UUI data transport function is essentially obtained without any
   additional effort or work.

   However, the authors believe that SIP needs to have its own native
   UUI data transport mechanism.  It is not reasonable for a SIP UA to
   have to implement another entire protocol (either ISDN or NSS, for
   example) just to get the very simple UUI data transport service.  Of
   course, this work does not preclude anyone from using other protocols

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 October 2013


   with SIP to transport UUI data.

8.3.  MIME body Approach

   One method of transport is to use a MIME body.  This is in keeping
   with the SIP-T architecture [RFC3372] in which MIME bodies are used
   to transport ISUP information.  Since the INVITE will normally have
   an SDP message body, the resulting INVITE with SDP and UUI data will
   be multipart MIME.  This is not ideal as many SIP UAs do not support
   multipart MIME INVITEs.

   A bigger problem is the insertion of a UUI message body by a redirect
   server or in a REFER.  The body would need to be encoded in the
   Contact URI of the 3xx response or the Refer-To URI of a REFER.
   Currently, the authors are not aware of any UAs that support this
   capability today for any body type.  As such, the complete set of
   semantics for this operation would need to be determined and defined.
   Some issues will need to be resolved, such as, do all the Content-*
   header fields have to be included as well?  And, what if the included
   Content-Length does not agree with the included body?

   Since proxies cannot remove a body from a request or response, it is
   not clear how this mechanism could meet REQ-9.

   The requirement for integrity protection could be met by the use of
   an S/MIME signature over the body, as defined in Section 23.3 of RFC
   3261 "Securing MIME bodies".  Alternatively, this could be achieved
   using RFC 4474 [RFC4474].  The requirement for end-to-end privacy
   could be met using S/MIME encryption or using encryption at the
   application layer.  However, note that neither S/MIME or RFC 4474
   enjoys deployment in SIP today.

   An example:

   <allOneLine>
   Contact: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com?Content-Type=
   application/uui&body=ZeGl9i2icVqaNVailT6F5iJ90m6mvuTS4OK05M0vDk0Q4Xs>
   </allOneLine>

   As such, the MIME body approach meets REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-4, REQ-5,
   REQ-7, REQ-11, REQ-13, and REQ-14.  Meeting REQ-12 seems possible,
   although the authors do not have a specific mechanism to propose.
   Meeting REQ-3 is problematic, but not impossible for this mechanism.
   However, this mechanism does not seem to be able to meet REQ-9.

Internet-Draft               SIP UUI for CC                 October 2013


8.4.  URI Parameter

   Another proposed approach is to encode the UUI data as a URI
   parameter.  This UUI parameter could be included in a Request-URI or
   in the Contact URI or Refer-To URI.  It is not clear how it could be
   transported in a responses which does not have a Request-URI, or in
   BYE requests or responses.

  <allOneLine>
  Contact: <sip:+12125551212@gateway.example.com;uui=ZeGl9i2icVqaNVailT6
  F5iJ90m6mvuTS4OK05M0vDk0Q4Xs>
  </allOneLine>

   An INVITE sent to this Contact URI would contain UUI data in the
   Request-URI of the INVITE.  The URI parameter has a drawback in that
   a URI parameter carried in a Request-URI will not survive retargeting
   by a proxy as shown in Figure 2 of [RFC6567].  That is, if the URI is
   included with an Address of Record instead of a Contact URI, the URI
   parameter in the Reqeuest-URI will not be copied over to the Contact
   URI, resulting in the loss of the information.  Note that if this
   same URI was present in a Refer-To header field, the same loss of
   information would occur.

   The URI parameter approach would meet REQ-3, REQ-5, REQ-7, REQ-9, and
   REQ-11.  It is possible the approach could meet REQ-12 and REQ-13.
   The mechanism does not appear to meet REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-4, and
   REQ-14.
