                      RBridge: Pseudonode Nickname
                 draft-hu-trill-pseudonode-nickname-01

Abstract

   The Appointed Forwarder on a link for VLAN-x is the RBridge that
   ingresses native frames from the link and egresses native frames to
   the link in VLAN-x.  If the appointed forwarder for an end station is
   changed, the remote data traffic to the end station could fail.  This
   document is proposed to assign a nickname for pseudonode identifying
   a multi-access link to solve the issue.  When any appointed forwarder
   encapsulates a packet, it uses the pseudonode nickname as "ingress
   nickname" rather than its own nickname.  If it does, then if the
   appointed forwarder changes, or the DRB changes, and the pseudonode
   still uses the same nickname, then the remote RBridge caches won't
   need to change, and the data traffic to the end station would reach
   the link uninterruptedly.

Internet-Draft             Pseudonode Nickname             November 2011


1.  Problem Statement

   The IETF TRILL protocol [RFC6325] provides optimal pair-wise data
   frame forwarding without configuration, safe forwarding even during
   periods of temporary loops, and support for multipathing of both
   unicast and multicast traffic.  TRILL accomplishes this by using
   [IS-IS] [RFC1195] link state routing and encapsulating traffic using
   a header that includes a hop count.  The design supports VLANs and
   optimization of the distribution of multi-destination frames based on
   VLANs and IP derived multicast groups.  Devices that implement TRILL
   are called RBridges.

   The AF (Appointed Forwarder) on a link for VLAN-x is the RBridge that
   ingresses native frames from the link and egresses native frames to
   the link in VLAN-x.  If the appointed forwarder for an end station
   goes down and a different RBridge is appointed as appointed forwarder
   on the link, the end station will not perceive the changes.
   Therefore, the cache in remote RBridge could not be correct until it
   receives the data traffic from the end station, and the traffic from
   the remote RBridge to the end station could fail for a while.  It is
   even worse for the Swap Nickname Field approach in multi-level TRILL
   network, for the egress RBridge of remote level 1 area cannot update
   the correspondence of MAC/VLAN-x and the pair of {ingress nickname,
   swap ingress nickname} until it receives the data traffic from end
   station [Mltrill].

   Pseudonode nickname is proposed in this document to solve the above
   issue.  Pseudonode nickname is assigned by DRB and used to identify a
   multi-access link.  With pseudonode nickname, the data traffic to the
   end station can reach the destination link uninterruptedly and be
   forwarded to the end station by other RBridge even if the appointed
   forwarder for the VLAN on the link is changed.

   This document is organized as following: Section 2 is the concept of
   pseudonode nickname.  Section 3 introduces the LSP announcement
   mechanism for the pseudonode nickname.  Section 4 describes the
   RBridges processing of transit frame traffic when considering
   pseudonode nickname.  Section 6 specifies pseudonode nickname
   capability TLV and pseudonode nickname TLV format.

   Familiarity with [RFC6325] is assumed in this document.

1.1.  Terminology and Acronyms

   This document uses the acronyms defined in [RFC6325] and the
   following additional acronym:

   AF - Appointed Forwarder

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   When used in lower case, these words convey their typical use in
   common language, and are not to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


2.  Pseudonode Nickname

   Pseudonode nickname is used to identify a link and SHOULD be reused
   after DRB changed.  It is assigned by DRB on the link.  When the
   RBridge becomes DRB and it doesn't find the pseudonode nickname from
   TRILL Hello of other RBridges, DRB assigns and announces a pseudonode
   nickname in its TRILL Hello on the link.  If the new DRB obtains the
   pseudonode nickname from the TRILL Hellos of adjacent RBridges on the
   link, it reuses this nickname.  The nickname for the pseudonode
   SHOULD keep unchanged even if the DRB or AF changed.

   All the RBridges on the link should support pseudonode nickname,
   otherwise the RBridges that don't understand pseudonode nickname on
   the link cannot forward the encapsulated TRILL frame with pseudonode
   nickname.  Each RBridge on the link announces its pseudonode nickname
   capability in its TRILL Hello.  Only if DRB checks that all the
   adjacencies in Report state support and enable the pseudonode
   nickname capability, DRB assigns pseudonode nickname on the link.  If
   not, DRB MUST NOT announce the pseudonode nickname in its pseudonode
   LSP in the TRILL campus network, otherwise, the remote data traffic
   may be forwarded to the RBridge without pseudonode nickname
   capability, and be discarded in the RBridge.

   The bypass pseudonode bit is used to determine whether DRB should
   generate the pseudonode LSP.  When bypass pseudonode bit is reset,
   the DRB should support pseudonode function and generate the
   pseudonode LSP [RFC6327].  So if DRB assigns pseudonode nickname on
   the link, the bypass pseudonode bit MUST be reset in its TRILL Hello.

   For an acess port, no TRILL frames, except TRILL-Hello frames, can be
   transmitted (see Section 4.9.1 in [RFC6325]).  However, some TRILL
   data frames may be transmitted among RBridges on a pseudonode
   nickname enabled link (see Section 4).  Therefore, if an RBridge
   supports pseudonode nickname function on a link, its port(or ports)
   to this link MUST NOT be access port (or ports), i.e., the TRILL
   traffic disable (access port) bit MUST NOT be set on the port (or
   ports).

3.  LSP Announcement

   Pseudonode nickname is only announced in the DRB's pseudonode LSP in
   TRILL campus.  If one of the RBridges on the link is disabled of the
   pseudonode nickname function, that is, DRB receives a TRILL Hello
   without pseudonode nickname capability enabled from the port on the
   link, the pseudonode nickname function should be disabled on the
   link, and then DRB updates its pseudonode LSP which doesn't include
   pseudonode nickname TLV in the TRILL campus campus.

   While if an RBridge (not DRB) supporting pseudonode nickname joins
   into or exits from the link, it has no influence to the pseudonode
   nickname LSP originated by DRB.  If an RBridge is selected as new DRB
   and the pseudonode nickname capability on the link is confirmed, it
   will generate and flood pseudonode LSP including the pseudonode
   nickname TLV in the TRILL campus.  If DRB finds that the pseudonode
   nickname function is disabled on the link, it will updates its
   pseudonode LSP which doesn't include pseudonode nickname TLV in the
   TRILL campus network.

   The pseudonode nickname is participated in path computing.  The
   procedure of path computing of pseudonode nickname is same as the
   routing computing of IPv4 or IPv6 address in layer 3 IS-IS network
   [RFC1195].

   Furthermore, pseudonode nickname can also be used to designate a
   distribution tree rooted at the pseudonode it identifies.  If it is
   desired for a pseudonode to be a tree root, the DRB MUST advertise in
   its pseudonode LSP a "tree root" priority for this pseudonode
   nickname.


4.  Influece on Transit Frame Processing

   In TRILL protocol, Layer 2 frames are divided into five categories:
   native frames, TRILL Data frames, Layer 2 control frames, TRILL
   control frames and TRILL other frames(see Section 1.4 of [RFC6325]).
   Only the first two categories of frames are forwarded by RBridges, so
   they are called transit frames.  Pseudonode nickname are only used
   for transit frames in this specification.

   From a forwarding standpoint, transit frames may be classified into
   two categories: unicast and multi-destination.  Section 4.1 covers
   the changes in processing unicast frames on RBridges that
   participates in a pseudonode nickname group.  Section 4.2 describes
   the special processing of multi-destination frames on RBridges with
   pseudonode nickname capability enabled.

Internet-Draft             Pseudonode Nickname             November 2011


4.1.  Unicast

   The processing of unicast frames on both ingress and egress RBridges
   will be influenced by pseudonode nickname.  However, the processing
   on transit RBridges remains unchanged.

   Section 4.1.1 covers the changes of processing native frames on a
   pseudonode nickname participated ingress RBridge.  Section 4.1.2
   describes two methods to process TRILL data frames on egress RBridge.

4.1.1.  Ingress Processing

   When a VLAN-x tagged native frame is sent onto a multi-access link,
   only the appointed forwarder for that VLAN-x can ingress this frame
   into TRILL campus.  If the pseudonode nickname capability is enabled
   on the link, the default is the forwarder uses the link's pseudonode
   nickname rather than the RBridge's nickname as ingress nickname when
   it converts a native frame received from this link, to TRILL data
   frames.  This forwarder MAY use other nickname(such as the RBridge's
   nickname) than the pseudonode nickname as ingress nickname when it
   does TRILL-encapsulation to native frames received from this link if
   it has been configured to do so.  The encapsulation of the native
   frame is as same as Section 4.1 of [RFC6325] except for the ingress
   nickname in TRILL header.

4.1.2.  Egress Processing

   On receiving a unicast TRILL data frame, the egress nickname in the
   TRILL header is examined, and if it is unknown or reserved, the frame
   is discarded.  Then the Inner.VLAN ID, i.e., VLAN-x, is checked.  If
   it is 0x0 or 0xFFF, the frame is discarded.

   This RBridge will be the egress RBridge for the TRILL data frame, if
   the egress nickname is one of the RBridge's nicknames or one of the
   pseudonode nicknames of the connected links.  If the egress RBridge
   is the VLAN-x forwarder on the destination link for this TRILL data
   frame, the frame is processed and the original self-learning is
   performed by this RBridge as described in [RFC6325].  Otherwise, the
   frame will be re-encapsulated and transmitted on the link by the
   egress RBridge.  Only the VLAN-x forwarder can decapsulate the TRILL
   data frame to native form and forward it to the end station on the
   link, which is consistent with the principle of ingressing and
   egressing native frame into and out of TRILL campus, i.e., there is
   only a single RBridge on each link that is in charge of ingressing
   and egressing native frames from and to that link [RFC6327].

   There are two methods for the egress to transmit the re-encapsulated
   TRILL data frame to VLAN-x forwarder on the link.  In



Zhai, et al.              Expires May 15, 2012                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft             Pseudonode Nickname             November 2011


   Section 4.1.2.1, the egress unicasts the re-encapsulated TRILL data
   frame to the VLAN-x forwarder, and in Section 4.1.2.2, the egress
   multicasts the TRILL data frame on the link.

4.1.2.1.  Unicasting to VLAN-x Forwarder

   To make the final hop, i.e., the egress RBridge (not VLAN-x
   forwarder), work for a frame addressed to the pseudonode, the
   forwarding table has to be based on {nickname, VLAN}, instead of
   {nickname} currently.  In the couple of {nickname, VLAN}, nickname is
   the pseudonode nickname, and VLAN is the VLAN Id of VLAN-x forwarder
   on this link.  If there are several appointed forwarders (each for a
   VLAN) on this link, several entries (each for a forwarder) exist in
   the forwarding table.  In the couple of {nickname, VLAN}, the VLAN
   will be ignored if the nickname is not a pseudonode nickname on one
   of local links, and will be set to invalid value(such as 0x0 or
   0xFFF).  In other words, if the VLAN in an entry is invalid, the
   nickname is not a pseudonode nickname.

   If the RBridge is not VLAN-x forwarder on the link, it goes to its
   forwarding table that says, based on the pseudonode nickname and
   VLAN-x Id, which of its RBridge neighbors, i.e., VLAN-x forwarder on
   this link, to forward to.  The forwarder is identified by the next
   hop MAC address in the found entry from the above table, which is one
   of the unicast MAC addresses on one of its ports connected directly
   on this link.  The TRILL data frame is discarded if no entry is
   found.  Otherwise, the outer frame header of the TRILL data frame is
   stripped, the TRILL header remains unchanged, and a new outer frame
   header is prepended before the frame is forwarded to the VLAN-x
   forwarder on the link.  For the forwarded frame, the Outer.MacSA is
   the MAC address of the transmitting port on the destination link, the
   Ouer.MacDA is the next hop MAC address in the found entry and the
   Outer.VLAN is the designated VLAN on the destination link.

   If the above re-encapsulated TRILL data frame is received by a stale
   VLAN-x forwarder on the destination link, it will be dropped by the
   RBridge.  Otherwise, the re-encasulated frame is processed as
   [RFC6325], and the Inner.MacSA and Inner.VLAN ID are, by
   default,learned as associated with the ingress nickname unless that
   nickname is unknown.

4.1.2.2.  Multicasting to VLAN-x Forwarder

   Alternatively, a special multicast MAC address, named "AF RBridges on
   this link", can be introduced for the final hop to forward such a
   TRILL data frame.  The scope of the above MAC is limited to local
   link, just as the MAC for IS-IS hello PDUs.  If a TRILL data frame is
   addressed to this special MAC and transmitted on a link, all the

Internet-Draft             Pseudonode Nickname             November 2011


   Appointed Forwarder (AF) RBridges on the link will process it to some
   extent.

   With "AF RBridges on this link" MAC address, the forwarding table can
   remain unchanged in form, i.e., still based {nickname}.  For an
   entry, the next hop MAC address will be "AF RBridges on this link",
   if the nickname is the pseudonode nickname on one of local links.  In
   other words, if the nickname is a pseudonode nickname, the next hop
   MAC MUST be "AF RBridges on this link".

   If not VLAN-x forwarder, the final hop RBridge, RBn, looks up its
   forwarding table, based on the egress nickname in TRILL header of the
   received frame.  The frame will be discarded if no entry is found.
   Otherwise, RBn re-encapsulates the frame just like what a transit
   Rridge does, except that the TRILL header remains unchanged and the
   Ouer.MacDA is "AF RBridges on this link".  If the egress nickname is
   pseudonode nickname, the re-encapsulated TRILL data frame is
   multicasted onto the link.

   The TRILL data frame with "AF RBridges on this link" as Ouer.MacDA is
   discarded by other RBridges, which are not AF RBridges, on the link.
   Otherwise, the Inner.VLAN ID, i.e., VLAN-x, is checked.  If the VLAN
   ID is not valid or the receiving RBridge, RBi, is not VLAN-x
   forwarder on this link, the frame is also discarded.  Else, the TRILL
   data frame is decapsulated into native form and forwarded to the
   destination end station, and the Inner.MacSA and Inner.VLAN ID are
   also, by default, learned as associated with the ingress nickname
   unless that nickname is unknown by RBi.

4.1.2.3.  Comparison

   With the Unicasting method described in Section 4.1.2.1, the re-
   encapsulated TRILL data frame by the final hop RBridge is only
   processed by the VLAN-x forwarder on the link, which can reduce the
   burden of other RBridges as much as possible.  But the forwarding
   table on ingress/egress SHOULD be changed to be based on {nickname,
   VLAN}, instead of {nickname}, where each AF Rbridge on a local link
   is identified by the pseudonode nickname and the vlan id of the AF on
   the link.

   With Multicasting method described in Section 4.1.2.2, although all
   the AF RBridges, except for the final hop RBridge, on the link are
   required to process, to some extent, the re-encapsulated TRILL data
   frame, only the VLAN-x forwarder decapsulates the frame to native
   form and forwards it to the destination end station.  However, the
   forwarding table can remain the same as current table in form, i.e.,
   only based on {nickname}.

4.2.  Multi-Destination

   If pseudondoe nickname function is enabled on a link, a forwarder
   SHOULD use the link's pseudonode nickname as ingress nickname, except
   that it has been configured not to do so, when it does TRILL-
   encapsulation for a native frame received from this link.  In TRILL
   campus, multi-destination TRILL data frames are propagated along the
   distribution trees chosen by ingress RBridges.  To limit the amount
   of state necessary to perform the RPF (Reverse Path Forwarding)
   check, for a forwarder on the link where the pseudonode nickname
   function is enabled, it MUST select a tree that the DRB has announced
   (in its psedonode LSP) to be one of those that (the RBridges on) this
   link might use, when it uses this nickname as ingress nickname in
   doing TRILL-encapsulation to a native frame.

   RBridges use SPF (Shortest Path First) algorithm, instead of spanning
   tree, to calculate distribution tree based on link state information.
   So the pseudonode, standing for a link, exists in distribution trees
   if the DRB advertises pseudonode LSP for this link.  If a forwarder
   is not attached directly to the pseudonode in the chosen tree, the
   use of the link's pseudonode nickname as ingress nickname by this
   forwarder may mess up the RPF check along this tree.

   For example, a simple topology is given in Figure 1, where RB1
   through RB4 are RBridges, H1 and H2 are end stations, S1 and S2 are
   serial links, and E1 is a multi-access link.  The numbers at the ends
   of each link are the metrics of RBridges' ports to the link.

                 Figure 2 Distribution Tree Rooted at RB1

   Let's assume that the pseudonode nickname function is enabled on link
   E1 and the pseudonode nickname is PseNickE1.  Then, on this tree, RB1
   expects to receive a multi-desitnation TRILL data frame with
   PseNickE1 as ingress nickname only from the right port.  When RB2
   ingresses a native frames from link E1 and propogates it along this
   tree, it uses PseNickE1 as ingress nickname.  However, when this
   TRILL data frame arrives at RB1 from the left port, it will be
   dropped by RB1 for the failure of RPF check.

   Two solutions are given to fix the above problem in this document.
   Section 4.2.1 covers special distribution trees identified by
   pseudonode nicknames.  Section 4.2.2 gives an optional method, which
   modifies the multi-destination frame processing behavior of RBridges,
   to some extent, to solve this problem.

4.2.1.  Distribution Tree Rooted at Pseudonode

   In TRILL protocol, a distribution tree is designated by a root
   nickname which identifies an RBridge or a pseudonode.  So it is

   possible to use a pseudonode nickname as root nickname to calculate a
   tree.  For examble, based on the topology in Figure 1, a distribution
   tree rooted at E1 is given in Figure 3.

            Figure 3 Distribution Tree Rooted at Pseudonode E1

   On this tree, R2 through R4 directly attach to pseudonode E1, so they
   can safely use PseNickE1 as ingress nickname when they ingress native
   frames from E1 and propagate the TRILL-encapsulated frames along this
   tree.

   To calculate such a tree in the campus, if it has confirmed the
   pseudonode nickname function can be enabled on its link, the DRB MUST
   announce in its pseudonode LSP the pseudonode nickname and a "tree
   root" priority for this nickname as well as the willing to use this
   tree when the pseudonode (i.e., all the RBridges on this link)
   ingressing a multi-destination packet.

   If such a tree are not actually calculated by all the RBridges in
   TRILL campus for some reasons, e.g., lower "tree root" priority, the
   RBridges on this link, which don't support the optional method given
   in Section 4.2.2, SHOULD reset pseudonode nickname capability in
   their TRILL Hellos.  Then the DRB on this link disables the
   pseudonode nickname function on this link.

   This method minimizes the change in ingress RBridges, caused by
   pseudonode nickname, but cannot guarantee that the special tree are
   actually calculated, which limits the application of pseudonode
   nickname function in multi-destination frames in TRILL campus.  So an
   optional method is given in Section 4.2.2.

Internet-Draft             Pseudonode Nickname             November 2011


4.2.2.  Changes of Processing Behavior

   From the viewpoint of a distribution tree, for a pseudonode, all the
   adjacencies on the link (represented by the pseudonode) can be
   divided into two categories:

   o  Adjacencies that directly attach the link's pseudonode, for
      examble, RB3 and RB4 in Figure 2;

   o  The rest of adjacencies, which do not directly attach the
      pseudonode, for examble, RB2 in Figure 2.

   For an adjacency in the first category, it is safe to use the
   pseudonode nickname to do TRILL-encapsulation to native frames from
   the link, and to propagate the TRILL data frame along the chosen
   tree.  But in the second category, an RBridge MUST change its
   processing of such a native frame, to some extent, if it desires to
   use the pseudonode nickname to do TRILL-encapsulation and propagate
   the TRILL frame safely along the chosen tree.  The changes of frame
   processing on an RBridge in the second category are as following:

   o  When doing TRILL-encapsulation to a native frame, the RBridge MUST
      NOT send this frame in native form or TRILL form out of any ports
      except the port from which this native frame is received, if it
      uses the link's psuedonode nickname as ingress nickname to
      encapsulate the native frame into TRILL form.  Only the TRILL-
      encapsulated frame is sent back to the link from the only port;

   o  When recieving a multi-destination TRILL data frame, if the
      ingress nickname of the frame is the pseudonode nickname of one of
      its links, the RBridge processes the frame as specified in Section
      4.6.2.5 of [RFC6325], but MUST NOT forward this frame in native
      form to the link represented by the ingress nickname (even if it
      is the appointed forwarder for that link for the frame's VLAN).

   With the help of the first change, the TRILL-encapsulated frame will
   be received by the RBridges in the first categories.  But the frame
   still fails Tree Adjacency Check on these RBridges, which causes the
   drop of this frame (see Section 4.5.2 of [RFC6325]).  So some bogus
   adjacencies on this tree must be added into these RBridges'
   forwarding tables, that is:

   o  For the RBridges in the first category, add all the RBridges in
      the second category as bogus adjacencies into their forwarding
      tables.  These bogus adjacencies are only used for the frame to
      pass the Tree Adjacency Check on the receiving RBridges, and MUST
      NOT be used for TRILL-encapsulated frame proporgating.

Internet-Draft             Pseudonode Nickname             November 2011


   With the help of the above three changes of frame processing, the
   multi-detination TRILL-encapsulated frames can be ingressed into the
   chosen tree from the psudonode and propagated along the tree safely.
   For example, in Figure 2, when RB2 encapsulates a native frame
   (received from H2) to multi-destination TRILL frame where the ingress
   nickname is PseNickE1, it does not sent the native frame to H1 and
   the TRILL frame to RB5 but does send this TRILL frame back to
   pseudonode E1.  Then this TRILL frame will be ingressed into this
   tree by RB3 and RB4.  RB1 will recieve this frame from the correct
   port, i.e., the port on the right side, and propagate it out of the
   left port.  At last, when receiving this frame, RB2 forwards it to
   RB5 and may decapsulate it into native form and forward to H1, but
   does not forward the native frame onto link E1.

   This method is optional.  It does not need special distribution trees
   to be calculated, but changes the frame processing on RBridges on
   this link, which imposes some changes of frame processing on silicon.


5.  Link Partition

   When RBridges on a link cannot receive the DRB's hellos during
   holding time, a new DRB will be elected.  Some issues can cause
   RBridges to receive no hellos from the DRB, for example, the DRB down
   or link partitioned and DRB on the other part of the original link.
   In order to improve the stability of remote RBridges' forwarding
   table, the new DRB should reuse the link's pseudonode nickname if it
   finds such a nickname has been used on this link (i.g., from its
   neighbors' hellos).

   In the issue of link partition, both of the DRBs on the two parts try
   to reuse the original link's psudonode nickname, which causes
   nickname collision.  A method to resolve such collision is given in
   Section 5.1.

5.1.  Solution to Nickname Collision

   To avoid a new DRB to usurp a pseudonode nickname from another DRB
   that is still using this nickname, extra rules are given for the
   priority of the pseudonode nickname reused by a new DRB, that is:

   o  The priority of the nickname reused by a new DRB SHOULD be lower
      than the priority of this nickname found on this link (i.g., from
      its neighbors' hellos), before the DRB ensuring no other DRBs
      using the same nickname in their pseudonode LSPs.

   o  After ensuring no other DRBs using this pseudonode nickname, the
      DRB increases the priority of this nickname to its original found



Zhai, et al.              Expires May 15, 2012                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft             Pseudonode Nickname             November 2011


      value.

   When an RBridge is eleceted as new DRB and advertises its first
   pseudonode LSP where a pseudonode nickname is contained, it should
   start a non-cyclic waiting timer to detect such collision.  If the
   timer expires and no such collision is found, the DRB can ensure that
   no other DRBs using the same pseudonode nickname.

   Whenever receiving a pseudonode LSP originated by other DRB, a DRB
   looks up the LSP in its LSP database to see whether it also has an
   instance of this LSP.  If it does not, or if the database copy is
   less recent, it installs the LSP into its database.  For such a
   pseudonode LSP, its pseudonode nickname will be compared with the
   link's nickname used by the DRB.  If the two nicknames are same,
   pseudonode nickname collision is detected.  Then the prirority of
   this nickname, along with system ID of the RBridge (numerically
   higher = higher priority) as tiebreaker, in the received LSP is
   compared with the priority (of this nickname) used locally.

   For the conflicting pseudonode nickname, the DRB performs the
   following extra steps to clear up this confliction:

   o  if the nickname priority in the received LSP is higher, the DRB
      SHOULD give up this pseudonode nickname and acquire a new one;

   o  else, the DRB continues to use this nickname, but it SHOULD update
      its pseudonode LSP (with a larger sequence number) to the TRILL
      campus.

   If a DRB oughts to give up its pseudonode nickname and acquire a new
   one, it SHOULD inform other RBridges in TRILL campus to clear up some
   the MAC entries whose egress "RBrige" nicknames equal to this
   pseudonode nickname, or to modify the remaining time of these
   entries.

   Since DRB knows all the VLANs for which end-station service is
   enabled on its link, the mechanism of Appointed Forwarder Status Lost
   Counter (AFSLC) (see Section 4.8.3 of [RFC6325]) can be employed for
   this purpose.  The DRB SHOULD update its pseudonode LSP, where the
   AFSLC for all these VLANs is increased at least one, before it uses
   the new acquired pseudonode nickname on this link and its pseudonode
   LSPs.

   Furthermore, if a DRB finds one or more such VLANs lost on its link,
   it SHOULD update its pseudonode LSP, in which the AFSLC for these
   VLANs is increased at least one, to inform other RBridges to handle
   the associated MAC entries in their forwarding tables.

6.  TLV Extensions for Pseudonode Nickname

6.1.  Pseudonode Nickname Capability in Hellos

   The pseudonode nickname capability of an RBridge MUST be included in
   one subTLV of Port Capability TLV in the RBridge's TRILL Hello PDUs.
   This capability is included in Special VLANs and Flags (subTLV Type
   #1) [RFC6326].  This subTLV MUST appear exactly once in a Port
   Information TLV in every TRILL Hello PDU.  The length of the value is
   four octets.

   Pseudonode Nickname capability TLV:


   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Type=VLAN Flags|                  (1 byte)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   +--+--+--+--+-------------------+
   |TR|PN|R |R |    Desig.VLAN     |  (2 bytes)
   +--+--+--+--+-------------------+

   The PN bit, if one, indicates that the sending RBridge supports and
   enables the pseudonode nickname capability.  If an RBridge does not
   support or not enable this capability, the PN bit MUST be set zero.

   Other bits and fields refer to [RFC6326].

   When receiving this subTLV from other RBridges on the link, the DRB
   can confirm whether all the adjacencies, in Report state [RFC6327],
   support and enable this capability.  If not, DRB MUST NOT announce
   pseudonode nickname in its pseudonode LSPs to the TRILL campus, which
   can avoid the issue that remote traffic is forwarded to a RBridges
   without pseudonode nickname capability.

6.2.  Pseudonode Nickname TLV

   If the DRB has confirmed that pseudonode nickname capability can be
   enabled on this link, it will announce the pseudonode nickname to be
   used on this link in its hello PDUs and in its pseudonode nickname.
   The pseudonode nickname is carried in pseudonode Nickname TLV, which
   is formatted as following:

   pseudonode nickname in its Hellos.  From the adjacencies' hellos or
   the nickname stored locally, the new DRB can knows the pseudonode
   nickname already used on its link.

   For an RBridge that is not DRB, it only processes the pseudonode
   nickname announced by DRB, and MUST overwrite its own pseudonode
   nickname with the DRB's pseudonode nickname if the two nicknames are
   different.  DRB should process the pseudonode nickname TLV from all
   the adjacencies in the Report state on the link in order to obtain
   the pseudonode nickname that was being used on this link.

   This TLV MUST appear no more than once in a Port Information TLV in
   every Hello PDU.  Only one nickname record can be contained in this
   TLV, if this subTLV appears in Hello PDUs.

6.2.2.  Pseudonode Nickname TLV in DRB's LSPs

   For a DRB on a link, it MUST originate and flood a pseudonode LSP for
   this link if the bypass pseudonode bit is reset.  All the adjacencies
   in the Report state on this link are contained in its pseudonode LSP.
   Furthermore, if a pseudonode nickname capability is enabled on this
   link, a pseudonode Nickname TLV MUST be contained in its pseudonode
   LSP.

   For a pseudonode LSP, the only one record in this TLV contains the
   nickname for the pseudonode standing for the link.  In this case, the
   value of Nickname.Pri varies from 1 to 255, which describes the DRB's
   priority to hold this nickname as specified in [RFC6325] Section
   3.7.3.
