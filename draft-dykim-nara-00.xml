    <abstract>
      <t>A network architecture based on recursive addressing is proposed. The
      Internet is modeled as a network of autonomous sites, each being a
      collection of nodes. Each site is named by a site address drawn from a
      global number space while each node is named by a node address drawn
      from a number space local to each site. Routing among sites depends
      solely on site addresses while that within each site on node addresses.
      Flat routing to render inherent mobility as well as mapped routing to
      additionally cope with table size are proposed. The model can
      recursively repeat itself both outwards and inwards in the network,
      enabling its applicability, for example, to inter-planetary as well as
      body area networks.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Scalability of the Internet has long been recognized as one of its
      major problems. Explosion of DFZ(Default Free Zone) routing tables, one
      aspect of the problem, has resulted from the Internet's inability of
      efficient multi-homing, for which semantic overloading of IP address has
      been blamed. This semantic overloading, that IP addresses are used as
      both identifiers(IDs) and Locators(Locs) for nodes, has also been
      perceived as against the naming and addressing principles<xref
      target="IEN0001"/><xref target="IEN0019"/><xref target="RFC1498"/> and
      so as the main obstacle hindering the Internet from providing fast
      mobility and multihoming. <vspace blankLines="1"/>A considerable number
      of new protocols based on the Loc/ID Separation(LIS) architecture have
      been proposed thus far. Some of them are host-based solutions <xref
      target="RFC4423"/><xref target="GSE"/><xref target="ILNP"/><xref
      target="IEEE-MCOM"/>while others are router-based<xref
      target="LISP"/><xref target="IRON"/><xref target="Ivip"/>. Most such
      proposals share one thing; IDs and Locs are global. <vspace
      blankLines="1"/>This document proposes an architecture, named NARA,
      based on local addressing in its strict sense. Local addresses, for
      nodes, are never exploited in DFZ (called exterior in this document)
      routing. A collection of nodes under an autonomous administration is
      called a site, and only site addresses identifying them are used for
      exterior routing. That way, the global network is split into two rather
      orthogonal tiers. <vspace blankLines="1"/>NARA is very close to the
      ideas proposed in ENCAPS and hIPv4<xref target="RFC1955"/><xref
      target="RFC6306"/>. The latter two, however, name node interfaces (or
      point of attachment: PoA) with either global IP addresses (in ENCAPS) or
      local Endpoint Locators (in hIPv4), whereas node themselves are named by
      local addresses in NARA. <vspace blankLines="1"/>Node addresses in NARA
      are semantically overloaded. They are used for end-to-end connections as
      well as for routing. This is a stark contrast to prevalent arguments of
      LIS. Semantic overloading is not seen as an evil in NARA, but is rather
      positively exploited to provide fast mobility and seamless multihoming.
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>Although this document describes NARA in two
      tier networks, the same addressing and routing principle can be
      recursively repeated inwards and outwards off a given network tier. In
      this respect, NARA can be considered as one of recursive network
      architectures. <vspace blankLines="1"/>Following sections describe the
      architecture of NARA and associated routing, along with implementation
      choices for a better chance of deployability. Consequences of the
      proposal are provided before concluding the document.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Architecture">
      <t>The Internet is modeled as a networked collection of autonomous
      sites. A site is a collection of nodes, also called either hosts(leaf
      node) or routers(relay nodes). A subset of hosts and an associated
      router forms a subnet. Therefore, a site can also be considered as a
      networked collection of subnets. A site itself can be a leaf or a
      transit.<vspace blankLines="1"/>

      The Internet is therefore governed by two-tier
      administration, i.e., the global authority and site authorities. <vspace
      blankLines="1"/>A site is named by a global site address while a node by
      a node address local to a given site. Now that each subnet is associated
      with a router, it can be identified by a router address. <vspace
      blankLines="1"/>Exterior routing among sites is done solely on site
      addresses while interior routing on node addresses. Node addresses are
      not used in exterior routing. That is, exterior and interior routings
      are orthogonal to each other. <vspace blankLines="1"/>Transport
      connections are also associated with node addresses. In this sense, it
      can be said that node addresses are semantically overloaded. In this
      proposed network architecture, semantic overloading of addresses is not
      considered harmful; it is considered rather natural and even desirable.
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>Neither node- nor site-addresses bear
      topological significance; they each consume separate flat number spaces.
      Node addresses don't change while nodes are moving around within a site.
      Site addresses also don't change at migration between upstream network
      providers as well as at multi-homing. <vspace blankLines="1"/>Node names
      are global. A name server provides mapping between a node name and a
      {node address, site address} tuple. If the site address is local,
      packets are delivered to the target interior node by use of an interior
      routing. If it is foreign, packets are delivered to one of exterior
      routers, aka gateways, interfacing with other sites.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="INTERIOR ROUTING">
      <t>Packets in the site tier, interior to sites, are routed solely on
      node addresses. Site addresses don't come into play in interior routing.
      Any protocols including OSPF and ISIS can be applied to this interior
      routing.</t>

      <section title="Flat-Address Routing">
        <t>In a scenario of flat-address routing, node addresses are directly
        used in routing and forwarding decisions. Each router maintains a
        table of {target node address, target router address, next-hop router
        address} tuples. Tables are updated through routing information
        exchange between routers. <vspace blankLines="1"/>Hosts may not
        involve themselves directly with such routing tables. It is up to
        routers to route packets exiting nodes. <vspace blankLines="1"/>When a
        node moves from one subnet to another, such a membership change is
        broadcast to all other routers in the site by the previous and/or
        newly visited subnet router(s). Host mobility provided directly by
        routers in this way can hence be fast. <vspace blankLines="1"/>When a
        subnet moves along with the associated router, such a move will be
        perceived as a topological change of the network and will be reflected
        in the routing tables at the speed of associated link-state updates.
        Henceforth, (subnet) network mobility is provided also as an inherent
        feature of the routing.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Mapped-Address Routing">
        <t>In a scenario of mapped-address routing, a common mapping server
        inside a given site is used in order to shrink the table size of each
        routers. {target node address, target router address} tuples are
        maintained by the mapping server whereas router tables will keep only
        {target node address, next-hop router address} tuples as with usual
        router activities. At reception of the first packet from a node after
        a given inactive interval, the router will consult the mapping server
        for the associated target router address. The associated next-hop
        router will then be determined by a given routing algorithm. Acquired
        {target node address, target router address} tuples may be cached at
        routers but will be short-lived lest stale information be used for
        mobile hosts. <vspace blankLines="1"/>Hosts themselves need not be
        aware of existence of the mapping server. They will continue to
        involve themselves only with node addresses, for source and target,
        and rely on routers for path finding. They will behave themselves the
        same way as they do with flat routing. <vspace blankLines="1"/> This
        scenario of mapped-address routing is very similar to the related
        operation of cellular networks. This might rather be considered as a
        merit, for cellular networks are known for their fast mobility.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="EXTERIOR ROUTING">
      <t>Packets in the global tier, exterior to sites, are routed solely on
      site addresses. Node addresses are not advertised into the global tier.
      Any protocols, BGP, OSPF or ISIS, can be applied to this exterior
      routing. <vspace blankLines="1"/>

      Each transit-sites can be considered to correspond, in a
      generic network graph, to relay nodes(routers) whereas leaf sites to
      leaf nodes(hosts). Therefore, symmetry of network architecture repeats
      itself at each tier.</t>

      <section title="Flat-Address Routing">
        <t>In a scenario of flat-address routing, site addresses are directly
        used in routing and forwarding decisions. Each transit gateway
        maintains a table of {target site address, target transit-site
        address, next-hop transit-site address} tuples. Tables are updated
        through routing information exchange between transit gateways. For
        multi-homed target sites, multiple entries for the same target site
        may exist with different next-hop transit-site addresses. <vspace
        blankLines="1"/>Leaf gateways may not involve themselves directly with
        such routing tables. It is up to transit gateways to route packets
        exiting leaf sites.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Virtual-Address Routing">
        <t>In a scenario of virtual-address routing, aggregatable addresses
        are used in order to shrink the routing table size. Transit gateways
        may use PA(provider-aggregatable) prefixes as virtual addresses for
        routing instead of site addresses. Each site address will then be
        associated with one or more (for multi-homing) PA prefixes, with such
        mapping maintained by a mapping server in the global tier. A site
        address will be converted by an upstream transit gateway to a PA
        prefix at entering that upstream provider, and the PA prefix will
        subsequently be converted back to the site address at leaving the
        upstream provider into the downstream target site. <vspace
        blankLines="1"/>Leaf gateways themselves need not be aware of
        existence of such PA prefixes. They will continue to involve
        themselves only with site addresses, for source and target, and hence
        behave themselves the same way as they do with flat routing.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="IMPLEMENTATION CHOICES">
      <t>Although the proposed network architecture of NARA is described in a
      generic way, it can be tailored for smooth and incremental deployment in
      the existing Internet.</t>

      <section title="Node Address">
        <t>In principle, both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be used for local
        node addresses. However, since 32-bit might be more than enough for
        most sites, use of IPv4 addresses might be more appealing. <vspace
        blankLines="1"/>Use of IPv4 addresses ensures minimal changes to
        existing vast population of IPv4 hosts. Also, transition to IPv6
        addresses will not be a requisite anymore, but a luxurious option at
        most. <vspace blankLines="1"/>It is to be noted that IP addresses
        adopted as such do not name interfaces anymore but name nodes
        themselves. That is, although IP addresses will continue to be used,
        interpretation of their context will be changed.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Site Address">
        <t>32-bit IP addresses can be used for site addresses. The uniqueness
        of the site addresses will be maintained by the distribution
        authorities like ICANN. <vspace blankLines="1"/>One might wonder where
        to carry site addresses. It is proposed to carry them in the IPv4
        option field of length 32 bits. It is long enough to accommodate a
        considerable number of sites that may additionally come into being in
        the global Internet. <vspace blankLines="1"/>Another option is to
        follow the scheme proposed in hIPv4. That is, node addresses and site
        addresses can be swapped by gateways (called Locator Swap Router in
        hIPv4) at exiting and entering given sites.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Name Servers">
        <t>In the two-tier model described here, names are globally unique.
        DNS can continue to be used with a bit of extension; to return {node
        address, site address} pairs instead of {IP address}. <vspace
        blankLines="1"/>The scope of names can be an issue in recursive
        repetition of this network architecture. If the tiers would recurse
        without bound inwards and/or outwards, demanding uniqueness of names
        in the entire resultant network may not be feasible because of
        excessive length of the names. <vspace blankLines="1"/>Name resolution
        can also be done recursively. For example, if a remote node wants to
        get a body temperature of a human node, an application message "get
        body temperature" may first be targeted to the human node of an
        address pair (node, site), for which a name server as in Fig. 1 has
        done the mapping. Then, the content of the message may be used to
        consult another name server encompassing the tier pair one level
        deeper, that is the tier where the human body belongs and another
        covering the nodes inside the human body. This name server can then
        return an address pair (in-human node, human node) to continue address
        swapping to reach the final thermometer. That is to say,
        context-awareness may ensure recursive name service.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Routing Protocols">
        <t>OSPF or ISIS can be used for interior routing. A difference is that
        IP addresses (as node addresses) now points to nodes instead of
        interfaces. Changes to OSPF coding should be minimal. ISIS might be
        better suited in this sense because it inherently deals with node
        addresses. <vspace blankLines="1"/>Although other protocols, in
        principle, could also be used for exterior routing, BGP4 with some
        modification with virtual-address routing might be a choice more
        acceptable as a start to most existing ISPs and large transit
        sites.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="DEPLOYABILITY">
      <section title="Distribution of Site Addresses">
        <t>The first step towards to introduction of NARA is that site
        addresses be distributed and managed by naming and numbering
        authorities like ICANN and regional Internet registries.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Changes to DNS">
        <t>DNS shall be recoded or reconfigured to deal with {node address,
        site address} pairs in place of only {IP address}. Necessary changes
        would be trivial and so could be done in a global scale with minimal
        pains.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Changes to Hosts">
        <t>As far as transport connections are concerned, nothing changes for
        hosts. <vspace blankLines="1"/>The only change would be reconfigure
        and enable hosts to put the site address acquired from DNS into the IP
        option field. There'll be rare need to look into the site address in
        received packets since it is not associated with transport connections
        at all; the node address only will be.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Changes to Routers">
        <t>If flat-address routing is used, a new column has to be added to
        the routing table to house target node addresses. Also, membership
        change of children nodes per each router should be added to link-state
        update messages. <vspace blankLines="1"/>A potential concern about the
        flat-address routing is that the number of table entries will
        considerably increase to accommodate all possible active nodes in a
        given site. This may be seen as too much a burden for large sites,
        although it may be quite manageable for small sites. The resultant
        table size could be economically affordable even for larger sites,
        considering the current memory technology. Another issue might be the
        lookup speed for such large tables, for which there might be an ample
        number of smart implementation techniques. <vspace
        blankLines="1"/>Benefits from this large flat tables is, however,
        huge. Mobility, for both hosts and subnets, is provided as an inherent
        function of routing. No extra infrastructural element is needed, and
        the provided mobility is very fast, i.e., at the speed of broadcast
        packet propagation. <vspace blankLines="1"/>If mapped-address routing
        should be used, the table to be managed by each router will be the
        same as with usual routing; {target node address, next-hop router
        address}. Only extra action to be taken is consult an in-site server
        for {target node address, target router address} mapping, to be cached
        for persistent continuation of smooth packet flow for an ongoing
        session. Necessary code changes will be minimal.</t>

      <section title="Use of IP Option Field">
        <t>Hosts and routers will have to be ready to use IP option fields. It
        is asserted by a lot of experts that use of the IP option field is not
        going to work since most routers today, interior as well as exterior,
        are configured by network operators simply to ignore any IP options.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>However, as long as the problem is non-use of
        an available facility rather than lack of its implementation, it would
        highly be encouraged to reconfigure the nodes to respond to option
        fields to switch to the operational mode proposed by NARA. <vspace
        blankLines="1"/>Another side effect of the use of the IP option field
        is increasing the packet size by 64-bits; 32 bits for each source and
        target site addresses. This should, however, be a minimal burden in
        view of the benefits from the new architecture as well as compared to
        other new network architectural proposals most of which inevitably
        increase the packet size.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Introduction of Extra Servers">
        <t>If mapped-address interior routing is to be used, a mapping server
        has to be installed inside each site. If virtual-address exterior
        routing is to be used, another mapping server has to be installed in
        the exterior (global) tier. Installation and management of such
        servers involve only central management authorities, not every client
        nodes or sites, and hence any cost or pains should be confined to a
        small number of entities.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="CONSEQUENCES">
      <section title="Recursive Internet">
        <t>In NARA, the network architectures of the interior (in-site) and
        the exterior (global) tiers are symmetric, basically the same.
        Therefore, the same generic architecture can be repeated without bound
        outwards as well as inwards. For example, in the design of an
        inter-planetary Internet, the same architecture can be placed on top
        of the global Internet. Also, in accommodating edge networks like body
        area networks which by themselves may each consist of a huge number of
        internal nodes(e.g. in the case of intelligent robots), repetition of
        the same architecture might significantly reduce the complexity of the
        whole-scale networking. <vspace blankLines="1"/>The Internet modeled
        as with NARA can be asserted to be scalable and expandable without
        bound.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="No Address Depletion">
        <t>Since the global Internet is split into two tiers of manageable
        size, there'd be no danger of address depletion. The 32-bit length for
        node addresses will be more than enough for most sites' need. The same
        should be true of the 32-bit site address length. In fact, migration
        to IPv6 is not a requirement anymore, but merely a luxurious
        option.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="No Inadvertent Internet Governance">
        <t>Since sites don't have to buy node address spaces from any
        authorities, the impact of the Internet governance will reduce only to
        a minimal necessity.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Fast Mobility">
        <t>Host mobility inside a site is provided as default. Transport
        connections are associated with node addresses which don't change
        while nodes are moving inside a given site. Transport connections
        don't break at in-site host mobility. And since such mobility is
        directly provided by link-state routing, with periodic link-state
        updates augmented by immediate event broadcast, host mobility is as
        fast as the speed of broadcast packet propagation. <vspace
        blankLines="1"/>Network(subnet) mobility is also provided as an
        inherent feature of interior routing. Renumbering of mobile subnets is
        not necessary since each subnet is identified by the associated router
        address which, being itself a node address, does not change inside a
        given site. <vspace blankLines="1"/>Mobility across sites poses a
        number of challenges. In order to continue communication in a newly
        visited site, node authentication will have to take place before
        anything. Such authentication process may take a considerable number
        of seconds, if not minutes, hard to guarantee non-breakage of
        transport connections. <vspace blankLines="1"/>Even if authentication
        may be swift enough to guarantee sustaining mobile connections,
        reflection of site changes onto the name server might take at least
        tens of seconds to converge. If this time lag is not to be borne, the
        gateway of the previous site might continue redirecting the incoming
        packets to the newly visited site, just long enough for name servers
        to converge. Engineering techniques employed by cellular networks
        might enlighten the detailed design of fast cross-site mobility in
        NARA.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Site Multi-homing and Migration">
        <t>Site addresses also don't change at migration to new upstream
        transit sites. Therefore, there's no need for refreshing DNS for nodes
        inside migrating sites. The only action might be to update the entries
        for migrating sites in the {site address, PA prefix} mapping server,
        yet only in the case of virtual-address routing. <vspace
        blankLines="1"/>Site multi-homing with flat exterior routing is not a
        problem, either. The same site address of a multi-homed site will
        simply be seen simultaneously in gateway routing tables of involved
        upstream transit sites. In the case of virtual-address routing,
        multiple entries will exist in the mapping server for the same
        multi-homed site, a {site address, PA prefix} pair for each upstream
        transit sites.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Host Multi-homing">
        <t>Host multi-homing can also be supported. If a host is multi-homed
        on multiple sites, there'd be multiple return values {node address,
        site address} for the same name. Transport connections through
        different sites would be considered as different ones. If there's need
        to converge these multiple connections to be presented as a single
        virtual transport connection to a given application, some sort of
        session management function might be exploited on top of the transport
        layer as is done with MPTCP<xref target="RFC6182"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Traffic Engineering">
        <t>Gateways of a multi-homed sites can control inbound traffic
        according to the remote site addresses. Interior routers can also
        choose exit gateways in accordance with target site addresses. <vspace
        blankLines="1"/>If traffic engineering in the granularity of a node is
        desired, nodes may involve themselves in informing the subnet routers
        of their preferred site address of a given remote multi-homed site or
        even the preferred site address of a given remote multi-homed node.
        The same can be done for preference about the exiting gateway. <vspace
        blankLines="1"/>MPTCP can additionally be employed with no impact on
        the normal NARA operation, to benefit from its implicit traffic
        engineering capability, too.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="No Renumbering">
        <t>Since node addresses are local, no renumbering of nodes is
        necessary at site migration or multi-homing.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Semantic Overloading">
        <t>The current proposal implicitly suggests that semantic overloading
        of an address may not be seen as a fatal problem to a network
        architecture. The addresses, of nodes and sites, are used both for
        identification and routing in NARA. This contextual malleability of
        addresses is seen as rather a virtue than an evil. It can also be
        argued that whatever separation one might engineer, semantic
        overloading would inevitably result in one way or another and so
        should rather be received as a natural phenomenon of networking.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="CONCLUSIONS">
      <t>A network architecture based on local and recursive addressing is
      introduced. The Internet is seen as a collection of sites, each being
      itself a collection of nodes. Addresses local to a given sites name
      nodes whereas global addresses do sites. Mobility, of both hosts and
      subnets, is very fast because it is provided directly by routers as one
      of their inherent features. Frozen site- as well as node- addresses
      guarantee seamless site migration and multi-homing with no need of
      renumbering. Address depletion is not an issue anymore and the Internet
      governance reduces to a minimal necessity. The proposed network model
      can repeat itself outwards as well as inwards, enabling its
      applicability to inter-plenary Internet as well as to body area
      networks.</t>
