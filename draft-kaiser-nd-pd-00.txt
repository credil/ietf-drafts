       Prefix Delegation extension to Neighbor Discovery protocol
                         draft-kaiser-nd-pd-00

Abstract

   This document describes an extension to the Neighbor Discovery
   protocol (ND).  The proposed extension enhances ND by providing it a
   new option: the Prefix Delegation option (ND_PD).  ND_PD offers the
   possibility for a router to ask for prefixes to be delegated, even if
   no DHCPv6 Server (or Relay) are present on link.

Internet-Draft                    ND PD                     October 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document describes a new option that extends ND with a PD
   mechanism.  Using this mechanism, a requesting router can ask for a
   global IPv6 prefix to a delegating router even if any DHCPv6 Server
   (or Relay) is present on the link.

   The goal of the ND_PD mechanism described in this document is the
   same as the DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation mechanism (DHCPv6_PD) described
   in [DHCPV6_PD].  Therefore, the ND_PD mechanism can be seen as a
   substitute of the DHCPv6_PD mechanism that can be used on links
   lacking in DHCPv6 Servers (or Relays).  Indeed, there exists a
   various number of situations where the DHCPv6 services may not be
   enabled on a link.  In the context of vehicular networks for
   instance, a vehicle (called Leaf Vehicle (LV)) may access the
   Internet through another vehicle (called Internet Vehicle (IV)) that
   shares its Internet connexion.  In order to provide Internet access
   to the nodes present in the LV, the latter needs a global IPv6
   prefix.  If the IV does not provide DHCPv6 services, the LV will not
   be able to get a global IPv6 prefix.  In this kind of situations, the
   LV can still ask for a prefix using the ND_PD mechanism.  Indeed, as
   the ND protocol is present on each IPv6 capable node (which is not
   the case for DHCPv6), providing ND with a PD extension ensures that
   any IPv6 router is able to request for a prefix in any situation.
   Moreover, as the proposed ND_PD mechanism relies only on the exchange
   of two messages (compared with DHCPv6_PD that needs the exchange of 4
   messages), it can be more suitable in the case of highly mobile
   networks (e.g. vehicular networks).

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in [DHCPV6_PD],
   [NEIGHDISC], and [SLAAC].  Also the following additionnal terms are
   used:

   Requesting router:      A router that is asking for prefixes to be
                           delegated.

   Delegating router:      A router that provides prefixes to requesting
                           routers.

   Prefix Collection:      A logical structure that stores a list of
                           Prefix Informations.  A Prefix Collection is
                           identified by its unique identifier, namely
                           PC_ID.

   Prefix Information:     A logical structure that stores all
                           informations related to a prefix.  A Prefix
                           Information is always associated with a
                           Prefix Collection.

4.  Related works

   A few drafts about providing a PD mechanism to the ND protocol have
   already been proposed in the past.

   In [DRAFT_LUTCHANSKY] the author proposes to add a PD option to the
   Router Solicitation (RS) and Router Advertisement (RA) messages
   generated by routers.  A router that needs a global prefix can ask
   for one by including a PD option in a RS message.  Then, a router
   that owns prefixes for delegation replies to the request with a RA
   that includes a PD option.  The main advantage of this proposal is
   that it is very simple and does not require any additionnal message
   to work.  However it lacks of completeness: the handling as well as
   the renewing and releasing of the delegated prefixes are not taken
   into consideration.

   In [DRAFT_HABERMAN] a more complete PD mechanism for ND protocol is
   proposed.  The mechanism is based on two new ICMP messages: the
   Prefix Request and the Prefix Delegation.  The former is used by a
   requesting router to ask for a prefix.  Conversely, the latter is
   used by a delegating router to reply to the request.  The proposal
   also includes the possibility for a requesting router to renew a
   delegated prefix that has not expired yet and to return a delegated
   prefix that is no longer required.

   The proposed ND_PD mechanism that is described in this document is
   close to the one described in [DRAFT_HABERMAN].  However, our
   mechanism relies on the creation of new RS/RA options rather that the
   creation of new ICMP messages.  Also, the ND_PD service provided by a
   router is advertised in the header of its RA.  This information
   enable requesting routers to be aware of the presence of routers that
   provide the ND_PD service on link without asking for it by, for
   instance, sending a RS on the all-routers link-local multicast
   address.

5.  Protocol overview

   The ND_PD mechanism presented in this document defines a new option
   for the RS and the RA messages.  Using this option, routers on a same
   link can request and/or delegate prefixes to other routers even if
   any DHCPv6_PD Server/Relay is present on the link.

   The Prefix Delegation option proposed in this document adds the
   following functionnalities to the Neighbor Discovery protocol:

   o  Request of prefixes

   o  Delegation of prefixes

   o  Renew of already delegated prefixes

   o  Release of delegated prefixes

   These functionnalities are described in more details in Section 6.

5.1.  Example use case

   In Figure 1 a vehicular scenario is shown.  The figure depicts two
   vehicles: a Leaf Vehicle (LV) and an Internet Vehicle (IV).  Both of
   them embed several Local Fixed Nodes (LFN), like sensors for example,
   and a Mobile Router (MR) that acts as a gateway between the network
   inside the vehicle (made of LFNs) and the outdoor.  The main
   difference between the LV and the IV is the number of interfaces
   present in the MR and its capacity to connect to an infrastructure
   network.  In this figure, the MR-IV has two egress interfaces: one
   connected to the infrastructure (E2) using a long range technology
   (e.g. 3G or LTE) and the other one connected to the LV (E1) in ad-hoc
   using a short range technology (e.g. wifi).  Let us assume that a
   DHCPv6 server exists in the infrastructure.  Therefore, using
   DHCPv6_PD the MR-IV can obtain a global prefix to announce on its
   ingress interface (I1) to configure its LFNs.  In order to enable the
   LFNs of the LV to access the Internet, the LV also needs a global
   prefix to assign on its ingress interface I1.  As the IV is neither a
   DHCPv6 Server nor a DHCPv6 Relay, the LV can still ask for a prefix
   to the IV using the ND_PD mechanism.  If the IV has a pool of
   prefixes to assign, it will delegate a prefix to the LV.  Otherwise,
   the IV can ask the DHCPv6 Server in the infrastructure for an
   additionnal prefix that it will delegate to the LV.

6.  Format of the Prefix Delegation option

   This section details the format of the option used in the ND_PD
   mechanism.  This option is only valid if included in RS or RA
   messages and MUST NOT be included in NS, NA, or Redirect messages.

   The Prefix Delegation option is used to manage everything related to
   delegated prefixes.  The following operations are considered:

   REQ:     Request operation.  A requesting router asks for a prefix to
            a delegating router.

   REP:     Reply operation.  A delegating router replies to a
            requesting router.  Depending on the type of request, a
            reply message acts as a delegating message that contains the
            delegated prefix (i.e. in response of a REQ, REN, or REB
            message) or as an acknoledgment message that contains the
            prefix that has been successfully released (i.e. in response
            of a REL message).

   REN:     Renew operation.  A requesting router asks the delegating
            router that provided it the prefix to extend its lifetime.

   REB:     Rebind operation.  A requesting router asks any delegating
            router present on the link to extend the lifetime of its
            delegated prefix.

   REL:     Release operation.  A requesting router that does not use
            anymore a delegated prefix informs the delegating router
            that provided it the prefix its intention of releasing it.

   The Prefix Delegation option is composed of a Prefix Delegation
   header followed by a list of Prefix Collection structures.  The
   format of the Prefix Delegation header is as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   an IA_PD option in DHCPv6_PD.  The format of the Prefix Collection
   header is as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

6.2.  Format of the Prefix Information structure

   A Prefix Information is a structure that holds all informations
   related to a prefix.  A Prefix Information can be seen as the
   equivalent of an IA_PD Prefix option in DHCPv6_PD.  The format of the
   Prefix Information is as follow:

7.  Prefix Delegation packets format

7.1.  Requesting prefixes

   The request for prefixes is done using the REQ operation.  Thus, the
   "Msg. Type" field in the Prefix Delegation option of the RS message
   MUST be set to REQ.

   When requesting prefixes a requesting router MUST add for each
   requested prefix a Prefix Information in the Prefix Delegation option
   of the RS message.  For example, if a router requests three prefixes,
   three Prefix Information MUST be included in the RS message.  The
   requested prefixes MUST also be associated to a Prefix Collection.
   The number of Prefix Information associated to a Prefix Collection is
   left to the choice of the requesting router.  However a Prefix
   Information MUST be associated with only one Prefix Collection.  The
   format of the RS message is as follows:

   +----+--------+------+------+-----+------+------+----
   | RS | PD opt.| PC 1 | PI 1 | ... | PI x | PC x | ...
   +----+--------+------+------+-----+------+------+----

   The fields "Renew Time" and "Rebind Time" in the Prefix Collection
   header and all the fields in the Prefix Information MAY be set to
   values that the requesting router prefers.  If the requesting router
   has no preference, these fields MUST be set to 0.  Also notice that
   the PC_ID value in the Prefix Collection header is left to the choice
   of the requesting router, following the rule that a PC_ID MUST be
   unique among all PC_ID known by the requesting router.

7.2.  Delegating prefixes

   The delegation of prefixes is done using the REP operation.  Thus,
   the "Msg. Type" field in the Prefix Delegation option of the RA
   message MUST be set to REP.

   Upon reception of a RS message, a delegating router replies with a RA
   message that includes all delegated prefixes.  If, for some reasons,
   the request (or part of the request) cannot be fulfilled, the
   delegating router replies with only the Prefix Collection header and
   the associated Status Code.  The format of the RA message is as
   follows:

   +----+--------+------+------+-----+------+------+------+----
   | RA | PD opt.| PC 1 | PI 1 | ... | PI x | PC 2 | PC x | ...
   +----+--------+------+------+-----+------+------+------+----
                                            \__  __/
                                               \/
                                   An error has occured thus
                                     PC 2 is empty of PIs.

7.3.  Renewing/rebinding prefixes

   The renew or rebind of prefixes is done using the REN or REB
   operation respectively.  Thus, the "Msg. Type" field in the Prefix
   Delegation option of the RS message MUST be set to REN or REB.

   When the Renew Time of a Prefix Collection expires, a requesting
   router SHOULD renew the Prefix Collection in order to continue using
   the associated delegated prefixes.  To this end, the requesting
   router MUST send a RS message to the delegating router that delegated
   it the Prefix Collection.  The RS message MUST contain all Prefix
   Collections (including all the Prefix Informations associated to
   them) that need to be renewed.  The format of the RS message is the
   same as the one presented in Section 7.1.

   When the Rebind Time of a Prefix Collection expires, the behaviour of
   the requesting router is the same as in the renew case.  The only
   difference is that the RS message MUST be sent to all routers present
   in the link.

   The behaviour of a delegating router that receives a Renew or Rebind
   request is as follows:

   1.  The delegating router can identify a Prefix Collection (using its
       PC_ID): it updates the Renew and Rebind Times of the Prefix
       Collection and the Preferred and Valid Lifetimes of all the
       prefixes associated with this Prefix Collection and adds in its
       RA message ("Msg. Type" = REP) the Prefix Collection (including
       all the Prefix Information associated with it).

   2.  The delegating router cannot identify a Prefix Collection: it
       adds in the RA message only the Prefix Collection header with an
       appropriate Status Code.

   The format of the RA message is the same as the one presented in
   Section 7.2.

7.4.  Releasing prefixes

   The release of prefixes is done using the REL operation.  Thus, the
   "Msg. Type" field in the Prefix Delegation option of the RS message
   MUST be set to REL.

   When a requesting router does not use anymore a prefix, it SHOULD
   release it.  To this end, the requesting router SHOULD send a RS
   message to the delegating router that delegated it the prefix.  The
   RS message MUST include the Prefix Collection header to which the
   releasing prefix is associated with and MUST only include the Prefix
   Informations related to the prefixes that should be released.  For
   example, if a requesting router has a Prefix Collection with four
   prefixes associated with it and it wants to release one of the four,
   only the Prefix Information of this prefix MUST be added in the RS
   message.  The format of the RS message is the same as the one
   presented in Section 7.1.

   When a delegating router receives a request for releasing prefixes,
   it replies with a RA message ("Msg. type" = REP) that includes either
   only the Prefix Collection header and an appropriate Status Code if
   an error occurred and the release cannot be fulfilled, or the Prefix
   Collection header and the Prefix Informations associated with it that
   have been successfully released.  Thus, this reply acts as an
   acknoledgment of the prefixes that have been successfully released.
   The format of the RA message is the same as the one presented in
   Section 7.2.

8.  Advertisement of the ND_PD service

   Each router that runs the ND_PD mechanism as described in this
   document MUST advertise the nodes about this service.  To this end
   the new D flag ("prefix Delegation" flag) is added in the header of
   the RA messages (according to [RAFLAGS] and [IANAWEB] the flag space
   could be allocated at position 6).  If set, this flag indicates that
   the router that originated the RA message provides the ND_PD service.
   Figure 2 shows the modified header of the RA messages that includes
   this new flag.

9.  Local operations on requesting and delegating routers

   Upon reception of a RS or a RA message, requesting and delegating
   routers MUST first check the validity of the message as described in
   section 6.1.  "Message Validation" of [NEIGHDISC].  The processing of
   the message itself along with any option other than the Prefix
   Delegation option described in this document is out of the scope of
   this document.

9.1.  Delegating router behaviour

   Upon reception of a REQ message, the delegating router checks the
   possibility to delegate the requested prefixes to the client.  If
   there are prefixes that are available in the pool to satisfy the
   whole or part of the request, the delegating router MUST add in its
   routing table one entry for each delegated prefix via the link-local
   address of the requesting router, and MUST reply with a REP message
   that includes all the delegated prefixes and MUST set the status code
   of the message to either FULL_SUCCESS (if all requested prefixes are
   delegated) or PARTIAL_SUCCESS (if only part of the requested prefixes
   are delegated).  All the prefixes that have been delegated MUST NOT
   be delegated again before being released either by a REL message
   coming from the requesting router or by reaching the valid lifetime
   associated to the prefix.  If the request cannot be satisfied, the
   delegating router MUST reply with a REP message that includes no
   prefix and MUST set the status code to NO_PREF_AVAIL.

   Upon reception of a REN message, the delegating router checks the
   possibility to renew each prefix present in the message.  For each
   prefix that can be renewed, the delegating router MUST update the
   corresponding entry in its routing table.  A REP message MUST then be
   replied with either the FULL_SUCCESS or the PARTIAL_SUCCESS status
   code depending on the number of prefixes that have been successfully
   renewed.  If none of the prefixes can be renewed, the delegating
   router MUST remove all corresponding entries in its routing table and
   MUST reply with a REP message whose status code is set to
   NO_PREF_AVAIL.

   Upon reception of a REB message, the delegating router checks the
   possibility to rebind each prefix included in the message.  For each
   successfully rebinded prefix, the delegating router MUST update its
   routing table by adding one entry for each delegated prefix via the
   link-local address of the requesting router.  A REP message MUST then
   be replied with either the FULL_SUCCESS or the PARTIAL_SUCCESS status
   code depending on the number of prefixes that have been successfully
   rebinded.  If none of the prefixes can be rebinded, the delegating
   router MUST reply with a REP message with a status code set to
   NO_PREF_AVAIL.

Internet-Draft                    ND PD                     October 2012


   Upon reception of a REL message, the delegating router checks the
   possibility to release each prefix included in the REL message.  For
   each successfully released prefix, the delegating router MUST update
   its routing table by removing the corresponding entries.  A REP
   message that includes all successfully released prefixes as well as
   the corresponding FULL_SUCCESS or PARTIAL_SUCCESS status code MUST be
   replied.  If, for any reason, none of the prefixes can be released,
   the delegating router MUST reply with a REP message that do not
   include any prefix and with the NO_PREF_AVAIL status code.

   When the Valid Lifetime of a delegated prefix has been reached, the
   delegating router MUST update its routing table by removing the
   corresponding entry.  The expired prefix is then available for future
   delegation.

9.2.  Requesting router behaviour

   Upon reception of a REP message that includes delegated prefixes
   (i.e. in response of a REQ, REN or REB message), the requesting
   router is free of advertising the prefixes included in the REP
   message on any of its interfaces except the one from which the REP
   message was received.  For each prefix that is advertised on an
   interface, the requesting router MUST add (or update if the entry
   already exists) an entry for the prefix through the interface where
   it is advertised.

   If a REP message is received in response of a REL message, the
   requesting router MUST stop advertising any prefix that is included
   in the REP message.  The requesting router MUST also update its
   routing table by removing each entry that matches the prefixes
   included in the REP message.

   If the Valid Lifetime of a delegated prefix is reached, the
   requesting router MUST stop advertising the expired prefix and MUST
   update its routing table by removing the corresponding entry.

10.  Status codes

   Status codes are present in the Prefix Collection headers.  They are
   used to give additionnal information to a requesting router about the
   result of its request.  Therefore, all Prefix Collections included in
   a REP message MUST include a Status code related to their current
   status.  On the contrary, the Status code has no utility when sending
   requesting messages (REQ, REN, REB and REL messages).  Thus, the
   Status code of a Prefix Collection MUST be set to FULL_SUCCESS
   (default value) by the requesting router and ignored by the
   recipient.  The following Status codes are supported:

   FULL_SUCCESS      Indicates that the request has been successfully
                     processed: the requested operation (REQ, REN, REB
                     or REL) has been successfull on all prefixes listed
                     in the Prefix Collection.

   PARTIAL_SUCCESS   Informs that only part of the request has been
                     successfully processed: the requested operation has
                     been successfull only on part of the prefixes
                     listed in the requested Prefix Collection.  Thus,
                     the replied Prefix Collection includes only the
                     successfull prefixes.

   NO_PREF_AVAIL     Informs that no prefixes are available for
                     delegation.
