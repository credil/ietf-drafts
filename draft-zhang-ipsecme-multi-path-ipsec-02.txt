                       Multiple Path IP Security
                draft-zhang-ipsecme-multi-path-ipsec-02

Abstract

   This document presents one approach to enhance data protection when
   transmitting IPsec datagrams across the insecure networks.  The
   method affords the stronger protection to the traffic by splitting it
   among a set of sub-tunnels.  All the Security Associations (SAs) are
   set up independently for all sub-tunnels.  Both the sending and
   receiving entity combine all the sub-tunnels to one clustered tunnel.
   As different sub-tunnel uses different crypto key materials and
   processing parameters, it may achieve the stronger protection of the
   traffic across the insecure networks.  In addition, it could possibly
   bring more benefits in terms of the network control.

1.  Introduction

   IPsec protocols suite specifies the base architecture for IPsec-
   compliant systems.  It describes how to provide a set of security
   services for traffic at the IP layer, in both the IPv4 and IPv6
   environments.  It defines security association (SA) as the
   fundamental concept to IPsec, which defines a simplex "connection"
   that affords security services to the traffic carried by it.
   Security services are afforded to an SA by the use of AH [RFC4302],
   or ESP [RFC4303], but not both.  If both AH and ESP protection are
   applied to a traffic stream, then two SAs must be created and
   coordinated to effect protection through iterated application of the
   security protocols.

   Since one SA is used to carry uni-cast traffic, a pair of SAs must be
   established in point-to-point communication.  The two SAs create one
   uni-cast IPsec tunnel between two security gateways.  In order to
   differentiate different SAs, the Security Parameters Index (SPI), one
   32-bit value, is used by a receiver to identify the SA to which an
   incoming packet should be bound.  The SPI assignment is done at the
   creator of the SA, or usually the receiving side.  At the sending
   side, additional destination IP address information can be used to
   resolve the SPI conflict.  In this way, the sending side can select
   the correct SA under which IP packet will be processed.  In this
   document, the new method also makes use of multiple SPIs.
   Nevertheless, it enhances the security service in different way from
   SA.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Multiple Path IPsec

   Data confidentiality is the protection of transmitted data from
   passive attacks, such as eavesdropping.  In current IPsec
   implementation, all the IP datagrams transmitted inside one IPsec
   tunnel are afforded protection by one SA.  In order to enhance the
   confidential security service, we use a set of SAs to protect the
   traffic.  We propose to set up multiple tunnels between two entities
   and then cluster them together to form one clustered tunnel.  One IP
   packet is still protected by one single SA.  The sending entity just
   splits the traffic among all these SAs.  The receiving entity must
   multiplex the traffic from the different IPsec tunnels.  All these

   tunnels clustered together are termed "sub-tunnels".  The SAs for
   these sub-tunnels are termed "sub-SA".  The IP traffic, which should
   be protected inside one clustered tunnel, is split among all the sub-
   tunnels.  The term "security association cluster", or "SA cluster",
   is used to describe the combination of SAs through which the traffic
   must be processed to satisfy a security policy.

   As multiple sub-tunnels are set up for the same flow of traffic
   between two secure entities, the physical paths may be different.
   The processing order of these clustered SAs is only local matter as
   all these SAs are not nested SAs.

3.1.  The SA setup

   The SA cluster setup consists of multiple sub-SA setups.  All these
   sub-tunnels are set up independently.  After setup, the sub-tunnel
   can be added to the cluster one by one.  But it is the local matter
   as how to add the sub-SAs into the SA cluster.  All the collaborative
   sub-tunnels have different SPI values.  There is no limitation on how
   many sub-tunnels can be used for one clustered tunnel.  Both the
   sending entity and receiving entity agree on SA cluster which will be
   used before any IPsec traffic goes through any of these sub-tunnels.
   After the traffic flows inside clustered tunnel, new SA can still be
   able to set up and join the SA cluster.

   Even though all the sub-tunnels are independent, they share only one
   sequence number source.  The IPsec packet carried inside the
   clustered tunnel has unique sequence number.

3.2.  The outbound packet processing

   The sending entity splits or alternates the IPsec traffic through
   different sub-tunnels.  When the SA cluster is selected for the
   traffic processing based on security policy configuration, one sub-SA
   is chosen for outbound IPsec processing only for that packet.  It is
   the local implementation that determines which SA should be applied



Zhang, et al.            Expires April 25, 2013                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               IPsec-multipath                October 2012


   to the specific IP packet.  Except that the sequence number is shared
   among all sub-SAs, all the other processing procedures are not
   altered.  A local implementation at sending entity can choose any
   method to obtain the sequence number for this packet, which is
   independent of sub-SA.

3.3.  The inbound packet processing

   The selection of sub-SA is the same as the selection of single SA,
   which is based on SPI and IP address information.  Except that the
   sequence number processing is a bit different, all other aspects are
   not changed.

   With the use of multiple sub-tunnels, by its nature, it could cause
   out-of-order delivery of IPsec packets for the secure communication
   channel between two entities.  As the remedy, the sequence number in
   IPsec header can be used if the receiving entity needs to maintain
   the sending order.

   If anti-replay is enabled, all these sub-tunnels will use one shared
   anti-replay bitmap at the receiving entity.  The anti-replay check is
   done against the SA cluster instead of sub-SA.  But it does not
   change how anti-replay is done.

3.4.  The SA expiration

   If sub-SA is negotiated through IKE negotiation, it may have its own
   soft and hard lifetime.  But there is no lifetime for SA cluster.
   There is no change as to maintenance of each sub-SA.

   If one sub-SA becomes invalid, it could not be used for further
   packet processing.  If SA cluster does not hold any valid sub-SA, it
   becomes invalid too.

3.5.  Multiple paths

   All these sub-tunnels are set up independently.  The traffic through
   the different sub-tunnels can go the same route.  It can also go the
   different routes based on the routing policy.  The path selection
   algorithm is out the scope of this document.

3.6.  Interoperability

   In case that SA cluster contains only one sub-SA, it must not have
   any interoperability issue with the current IPsec implementation if
   the current one does not support SA cluster.

3.7.  Reorder packets

   The solution of multipath introduces the issue of the possibility of
   out of order delivery.  Actually, this is the only solution which
   causes the disorder problem.  Even with single SA, it can also bring
   in the out of order problem.  Technically, the reorder process be can
   be done at aggregate node or end host, based on the topology of
   network, just like TCP reorder or IP reassembly [RFC5236][Zhang02].
   The reorder algorithm is out the scope of this document.


4.  The benefit for SA cluster

   The method enhances the security service by spreading the traffic
   onto multiple paths.  For example, it makes it harder for the
   attacker to intercept all the packets if different routes are used.
   Even with the same route used, it is harder for the attacker to know
   which set of SAs are clustered SA, thus harder to decrypt the
   intercepted packets.  With multiple paths selected, it provides high
   reliability especially in case of link failure.  It also provides the
   option for optimized performance and optimal network control, which
   is not covered in this document.


5.  Acknowledgements

   Wait for comments.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document intends to enhance the security service which IPsec
   provides.  SA cluster provides the option to perform the different
   cryptographic transformation on the different packet.  In addition,
   it also provides the option to transmit the packets along the
   different paths.


7.  IANA Considerations

   None.
