This document presents an ISAMKP Domain of Interpretation (DOI) for
group key management to support secure group communications.  The
GDOI manages group security associations, which are used by IPSEC and
potentially other data security protocols running at the IP or
application layers.  These security associations protect one or more
key-encrypting keys, traffic-encrypting keys, or data shared by group
members.

This document is a product of the Multicast Security Working Group of
the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.
