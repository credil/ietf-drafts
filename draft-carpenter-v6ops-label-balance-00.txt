Internet-Draft          Flow Label Load Balancers           October 2011


1.  Introduction

   The IPv6 flow label has been redefined [I-D.ietf-6man-flow-3697bis]
   and its use for load balancing in multipath routing has been
   specified [I-D.ietf-6man-flow-ecmp].  Another scenario in which the
   flow label could be used is in load balancing for large server farms.
   This document starts with a brief introduction to load balancing
   techniques and then describes how the flow label can be used to
   enhance layer 3/4 flow balancers in particular.

   Load balancing for server farms is achieved by a variety of methods,
   often used in combination [Tarreau].  The flow label is not relevant
   to all of them.  Also, the actual load balancing algorithm (the
   choice of server for a new client session) is irrelevant to this
   discussion.

   o  The simplest method is simply using the DNS to return different
      server addresses for a single name such as www.example.com to
      different users.  Typically this is done by rotating the order in
      which different addresses are listed by the relevant authoritative
      DNS server, assuming that the client will pick the first one.  The
      flow label can have no impact on this method and it is not
      discussed further.
   o  Another method, for HTTP servers, is to operate a layer 7 reverse
      proxy in front of the server farm.  The reverse proxy will present
      a single IP address to the world, communicated to clients by a
      single AAAA record.  For each new client session (an incoming TCP
      connection and HTTP request), it will pick a particular server and
      proxy the session to it.  Hopefully the act of proxying will be
      cheap compared to the act of serving the required content.  The
      proxy must retain TCP state and proxy state for the duration of
      the session.  This TCP state could, potentially, include the
      incoming flow label value.
   o  A component of some load balancing systems is an SSL reverse proxy
      farm.  The individual SSL proxies handle all cryptographic aspects
      and exchange raw HTTP with the actual servers.  Thus, from the
      load balancing point of view, this really looks just like a server
      farm, except that it's specialised for HTTPS.  Each proxy will
      retain SSL and TCP and maybe HTTP state for the duration of the
      session, and the TCP state could potentially include the flow
      label.
   o  Finally the "front end" of many load balancing systems is a layer
      3/4 load balancer.  In this case, it is the layer 3/4 load
      balancer whose IP address is published as the primary AAAA record
      for the service.  All client sessions will pass through this
      device.  According to the precise scenario, it will spread new
      sessions across the actual application servers, across an SSL
      proxy farm, or across a set of layer 7 proxies.  In all cases, the

      layer 3/4 load balancer has to recognize incoming packets as
      belonging to new or existing client sessions, and choose the
      target server or proxy so as to ensure persistence.  'Persistence'
      is defined as guaranteeing that a given session will run to
      completion on a single server.  The layer 3/4 load balancer,
      whatever method it uses for forwarding the session, is certain to
      inspect the source address and the protocol and port numbers in
      each incoming packet.  At the same time, it could inspect and make
      use of the flow label.

      Layer 3/4 load balancers use various techniques to actually reach
      their target server.
      - All servers are configured with the same IP address, they are
      all on the same LAN, and the load balancer sends directly to their
      individual MAC addresses.
      - Each server has its own IP address, and the balancer uses an IP-
      in-IP tunnel to reach it.
      - Each server has its own IP address, and the balancer performs
      NAPT (address and port translation).

   The following diagram, inspired by [Tarreau], shows a maximum layout.

   From the previous paragraphs, we can identify several points in this
   diagram where the flow label may be relevant:

   1.  L3/L4 load balancers.
   2.  SSL proxies.
   3.  HTTP proxies.


2.  Role of the Flow Label

   The IPv6 flow label is included in every IPv6 header [RFC2460] and it
   is defined in [I-D.ietf-6man-flow-3697bis].  According to this
   definition, it should be set to a constant value for a given traffic
   flow (such as an HTTP connection), but until the standard is widely
   implemented it will often be set to the default value of zero.  Any
   device that has access to the IPv6 header has access to the flow



Carpenter & Jiang        Expires April 15, 2012                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft          Flow Label Load Balancers           October 2011


   label, and it is at a fixed position in every IPv6 packet.  In
   contrast, transport layer information, such as the port numbers, is
   not always in a fixed position, since it follows any IPv6 extension
   headers that may be present.  Therefore, within the lifetime of a
   given transport layer connection, the flow label can be a more
   convenient "handle" than the port number for identifying that
   particular connection.

   According to [I-D.ietf-6man-flow-3697bis], source hosts should set
   the flow label, but if they do not (i.e. its value is zero),
   forwarding nodes may do so instead.  In both cases, the flow label
   value must be constant for a given transport session, normally
   identified by the IPv6 and Transport header 5-tuple.  The flow label
   should be calculated by a stateless algorithm.  The value should form
   part of a statistically uniform distribution, making it suitable as
   part of a hash function used for load distribution.  Because of using
   a stateless algorithm to calculate the label, there is a very low
   (but non-zero) probability that two simultaneous flows from the same
   source to the same destination have the same flow label value despite
   having different transport protocol port numbers.

   The suggested model for using the flow label in a load balancing
   mechanism is as follows.

   o  It is clearly better if the original source, e.g. an HTTP client,
      sets the flow label.  However, if the flow label of an incoming
      packet is zero, the ingress router at the server site should
      implement the stateless mechanism in Section 3 of
      [I-D.ietf-6man-flow-3697bis] to set the flow label value to an
      appropriate value.  This relieves the subsequent load balancers of
      the need to fully analyse the IPv6 and Transport header 5-tuple.
   o  The L3/L4 load balancers use the 2-tuple {source address, flow
      label} as the session key for whatever load distribution algorithm
      they support, instead of searching for the transport port number
      later in the header.  This means they can ignore all IPv6
      extension headers, which should simplify their design and lead to
      a performance benefit.
   o  The SSL proxies may do the same.  However, since they have to
      process the transport layer in any case, this might not lead to
      any performance benefit.
   o  The HTTP proxies may do the same.  However, since they have to
      process the transport and application layers in any case, this
      might not lead to any performance benefit.

   Note that in the unlikely event of two simultaneous flows from the
   same source having the same flow label value, the two flows would end
   up assigned to the same server, where they would be distinguished as
   normal by their port numbers.  Since this would be a statistically

   rare event, it would not damage the overall load balancing effect.


3.  Security Considerations

   Security aspects of the flow label are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-6man-flow-3697bis].  As noted there, a malicious source or
   man-in-the-middle could disturb load balancing by manipulating flow
   labels.

   Specifically, [I-D.ietf-6man-flow-3697bis] states that "stateless
   classifiers should not use the flow label alone to control load
   distribution, and stateful classifiers should include explicit
   methods to detect and ignore suspect flow label values."  The former
   point is answered by also using the source address.  The latter point
   is more complex.  If the risk is considered serious, the ingress
   router mentioned above should verify incoming flows with non-zero
   flow label values.  If a flow from a given source address and port
   number does not have a constant flow label value, it is suspect and
   should be dropped.
