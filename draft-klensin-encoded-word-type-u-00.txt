              The "U" Encoding for Encoded-Words in Email
                 draft-klensin-encoded-word-type-u-00

Abstract

   The "Encoded Word" conventions have been used extensively in email
   headers and elsewhere to permit the encoding of non-ASCII characters
   where only ASCII ones are normally permitted.  The existing
   specification defines only two kinds of encoding, one of which cannot
   be understood easily by people and the other of which has been widely
   discredited.  This document specifies a third encoding that is easily
   accessible by users and much more closely tied to contemporary
   practices.

   The current version of the proposal is intended for possible
   discussion in the EAI, IRI, and PRECIS WGs to see if it sheds light
   on other issues being discussed in those WGs.  It is not, at this
   point, proposed for adoption.

Internet-Draft          Encoded-Words: U Encoding          November 2011


1.  Introduction

   The "Encoded Word" conventions [RFC2047] have been used extensively
   in email headers and elsewhere to permit the encoding of non-ASCII
   characters where only ASCII ones are normally permitted.  That
   existing encoded-word specification defines only two kinds of
   encoding, one of which cannot be understood easily by people ("B",
   the MIME "Base64" encoding) and the other of which ("Q", so-called
   Quoted Printable) has been widely discredited.  This document
   specifies a third encoding, based on the "\u'NNNN'" convention, that
   is easily accessible by users and much more closely tied to
   contemporary practices.

   Unlike the "B" and "Q" encodings, which were specified at a time when
   many coded character sets were in common use, it is now appropriate
   [RFC5198] to tie a new encoding specifically to Unicode [Unicode] and
   the corresponding ISO Standard [ISO10646], viewing conversion to
   local character sets, if necessary at all, to be a local matter.
   Consequently, this specification permits only the combination "=?iso-
   10646-UCS-4?u?".

   [[anchor2: Note in Draft: If we were really going to do this, it
   would make sense to define a charset that would actually reflect
   Unicode code points, not some encoding of them.  Neither of the
   currently-registered "iso-10646-UCS-4" nor "UTF-32" and its
   variations are quite right for that purpose.  Cf.
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets]]

   If adopted, it is intended not only as an alternative to "Q" and "B",
   but also as an alternative to the %-encoding of Section 2.1 of the
   URI Specification [RFC3986] of UTF-8 [RFC3629] (and other) strings.
   %-encoding was more than adequate for its original purpose of
   encoding eight-bit character sets, notably ISO 8859-1 [ISO8859-1],
   but is problematic for email (especially addresses and fields related
   to them) because "%" has an important historic (and still
   occasionally used) meaning in those contexts and because its use to
   encode already-encoded forms of multi-octet character sets, such as
   UTF-8 and Unicode, creates strings that are at least as difficult for
   end users to interpret as Base64.

1.1.  Updated Specifications

   This document, if approved, updates the Encoded-Word specification
   [RFC2047] and the specification for the use encoded-words with
   language information [RFC2231] to permit use of an additional
   encoding type, type "U".

Internet-Draft          Encoded-Words: U Encoding          November 2011


1.2.  Terminology

   Some reasonable understanding of Encoded-Words and the Quoted-
   Printable, Base64, and %-encoding conventions are required to
   understand this introductory material but not the proposal itself.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
   in this document are to be interpreted as defined in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

1.3.  Scope and Discussion List

   RFC Editor: In the unlikely event that you see this subsection, it
   should be removed before publication.

   The current version of the proposal is intended for possible
   discussion in the EAI, IRI, and PRECIS WGs to see if it sheds light
   on other issues being discussed in those WGs.  If discussions are of
   interest, they should occur on the mailing lists associated with
   those groups.

   This Internet Draft is, at this point, intended only to promote
   discussion of a possibly-useful building block for other work.  It is
   not proposed for adoption by the IETF for any purpose.


2.  Specification

   A new encoding form for encoded words is defined with code "u".  The
   associated encoded-text string is consistent with the rules in
   Section 4 of RFC 2047, i.e., it consists of ASCII characters with
   space, tab, and "?" characters excluded.  Non-ASCII characters are
   encoded using the \u'NNNN' form, where "NNNN" consists of four to six
   hexadecimal digits designating a Unicode (ISO 10646) code point.
   That encoding convention is defined in RFC 5137 [RFC5137] together
   with an explanation of why the quotes should be required.

   As an example, the German equivalent of the string "This is nuts",
   would appear in the extended form of RFC 2231 (updated by verified
   Erratum 478 [RFC2231-Err478]) as
   =?iso-10646-UCS-4+de?u?Das ist verr\u'00FC'ckt?=


3.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not raise any security issues that are not
   already present in RFC 2047 and its various updates.  Because the
   coding is more transparent to the end user than any of Base64, Quoted

   Printable for non-ASCII text, or %-encoding of UTF-8, it may
   eliminate or reduce one possible attack vector that is present with
   those other approaches.


4.  IANA Considerations

   [[anchor9: RFC Editor: Please remove this section.]]
   Because there does not appear to be a registry for either encoded-
   word encodings or the content-transfer-encodings on which they are
   based, this document requires no actions by the IANA.
