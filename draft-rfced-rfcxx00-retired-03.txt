Abstract

   This document obsoletes RFC 5000 ("Internet Official Protocol
   Standards"), which contained a snapshot of the Standards Track
   documents as of May 2008, and moves RFC 5000 to Historic.  This
   document also retires the subseries identifier STD 1, which has
   previously been associated with publications of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards".

Internet-Draft               Retiring STD 1                  August 2013


1.  Introduction

   [RFC1083], published in December 1988, was the first document
   published in the RFC series that detailed a "list of documents that
   define the standards for the Internet protocol suite" and any ongoing
   experiments.  Snapshots were published on a periodic basis.
   [RFC1280] was the first of these publications to be published as STD
   1.  Starting with [RFC2200], RFC numbers ending with 00 were reserved
   for snapshots of the Official Protocol Standards.  [RFC5000],
   published in May 2008, was the last snapshot documented in an RFC.
   This document obsoletes RFC 5000, moves RFC 5000 to Historic, and
   retires the subseries identifier STD 1.  Additionally, RFC numbers
   typically reserved for these documents (i.e., those numbers ending
   with 00) are available for assignment to other RFCs-to-be.

2. Obsoleting RFC 5000 and Moving It to Historic

   Previously, publishing a snapshot of the current list of Standards
   Track and Experimental documents was helpful to the Internet
   community, as the information was not available otherwise.  However,
   in 2000, the RFC Editor produced an online list that is dynamically
   updated and available to individuals with access to the public
   Internet [STDS-TRK].  As the list has been online for over 10 years,
   it is time to make the online list more official, and formally
   obsolete RFC 5000.

3. Retiring STD 1

   In some sense, STD 1 was retired when RFC 5000 was published.  After
   consultation with the IAB, RFC 5000 was published as an Informational
   document, but was still identified as STD 1 in the document header.
   The status was listed as Informational, as the document does not
   describe an implementable Standard.  However, it was associated with
   STD 1 to keep the document consistent with its historic connection to
   the subseries identifier.

   This document formally retires STD 1.  Identifier STD 1 will not be
   re-used unless there is a future need to publish periodic snapshots
   of the Standards Track documents (i.e., unless the documentation is
   resumed).

4. Cleaning Up RFC Editor Data

   As part of the cleanup related to retiring the publication of the
   Official Protocol Standards, the RFC Editor will mark a number of
   unused numbers ending in 00 through RFC 6800 "never issued".  Moving
   forward, other numbers typically reserved for these documents (i.e.,
   those numbers ending with 00) will be assigned to future RFCs-to-be.

   The RFC Editor's STD index will also be updated accordingly to note
   that STD has been retired.
