			<t>This specification standardizes three media types -- 
application/xml, 
application/xml-external-parsed-entity, and application/xml-dtd --
for use in exchanging network entities that are related to the
Extensible Markup Language (XML) while defining
text/xml and text/xml-external-parsed-entity as aliases for the
respective application/ types.  This specification also standardizes
a convention (using the suffix '+xml') for naming media types
outside of these five types when those media types represent XML MIME
entities.</t>
			<t>Major differences from <xref target="RFC3023"/> are alignment of charset handling for text/xml and text/xml-external-parsed-entity with application/xml, the addition of XPointer and XML Base as fragment identifiers  and base URIs, respectively, mention of the XPointer Registry, and  updating of many references.

			<t>The World Wide Web Consortium has issued the
<xref target="XML">Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0</xref> and <xref target="XML1.1">Extensible Markup
Language (XML) 1.1</xref> specifications.
To enable the exchange of XML network entities, this specification
standardizes three media types -- application/xml,
application/xml-external-parsed-entity, and application/xml-dtd and two aliases -- text/xml and text/xml-external-parsed-entity,
as well as a naming convention for identifying XML-based MIME
media types (using '+xml').</t>
			
			
			
			<t>XML has been used as a foundation for other media
types, including types in every branch of the IETF media types
tree. To facilitate the processing of such types, and in line with the
recognition in <xref target="RFC6838"/> of structured syntax name
suffixes,  a suffix of
'+xml' is described in <xref target="naming"/>. This
will allow generic XML-based tools -- browsers, editors, search engines,
and other processors -- to work with all XML-based media
types.</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Notational Conventions" anchor="conventions">
			<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this specification are to be interpreted as described in
<xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
			<t>As defined in <xref target="RFC2781"/> (informative), the three charsets "utf-16",
"utf-16le", and "utf-16be" are used to label UTF-16 text. In this specification, 
"the UTF-16 family" refers to those three charsets. By contrast, the phrases
"utf-16" or UTF-16 in this specification refer specifically to the single charset
"utf-16".</t>
			<t>As sometimes happens between two
communities, both MIME and XML have defined the term entity, with
different meanings. Section 2.4 of <xref target="RFC2045"/>
says:</t>
			<t>
				<list style="empty">
					<t>"The term 'entity' refers specifically to the MIME-defined header
fields and contents of either a message or one of the parts in the
body of a multipart entity."</t>
				</list>
			</t>
			<t>Section 4 of <xref target="XML"/>
says:</t>
			<t>
				<list style="empty">
					<t>"An XML document may consist of one or many storage units. These are called entities; they all have content and are all (except for the document entity and the external DTD subset) identified by entity name".</t>
				</list>
			</t>
			<t>In this specification, "XML MIME entity" is defined as the latter (an XML entity) encapsulated
in the former (a MIME entity).</t>
   <t>Furthermore, XML provides for the naming and referencing of entities
for purposes of inclusion and/or substitution.  In this specification
"XML-entity declaration/reference/..." is used to avoid confusion when
referring to such cases.</t>
		</section>
		<section title="XML Media Types" anchor="registrations">
			<t>This specification standardizes three media types related to XML MIME
entities: application/xml (with text/xml as an alias),
application/xml-external-parsed-entity (with text/xml-external-parsed-entity as an alias), and application/xml-dtd.
Registration information for these media types is described in
the sections below.</t>
			<t anchor="xml_entities">Within the XML specification, XML MIME entities can be classified
into four types. In the XML terminology, they are called "document
entities", "external DTD subsets", "external parsed entities", and
"external parameter entities". 

Appropriate usage for these types is as follows:
 <list style="hanging">
  <t hangText="document entities">The media types 
application/xml or text/xml MAY be used</t>
  <t hangText="external DTD subsets">The media type application/xml-dtd SHOULD be used.  The media types application/xml and text/xml MUST NOT be used.</t>
  <t hangText="external parsed entities">application/xml-external-parsed-entity or
text/xml-external-parsed-entity SHOULD be used.    The media types
application/xml and text/xml MUST NOT be used unless the parsed entities are also well-formed
"document entities" and are referenced as such.</t>
  <t hangText="external parameter entities">The media type application/xml-dtd
SHOULD be used.  The media types application/xml and text/xml MUST NOT be used.</t>
 </list>

</t>   
 <t>
  <list style="empty">
  <t>Note that <xref target="RFC3023"/> (which this specification obsoletes) recommended
the use of text/xml and text/xml-external-parsed-entity for 
document entities and external parsed entities, respectively,
but described charset handling which differed from common implementation practice.
These media types are still commonly used,
and this specification aligns the charset handling with industry practice.</t>
   <t>Note that <xref target="RFC2376"/> (which is obsolete) allowed
application/xml and text/xml to be used for any of the four types, although 
  in practice it is likely to have been rare.</t>
 </list>
 </t>

			<t>Neither external DTD subsets nor external parameter entities
parse as XML documents, and while some XML document entities may
be used as external parsed entities and vice versa, there are
many cases where the two are not interchangeable. XML also has
unparsed entities, internal parsed entities, and internal
parameter entities, but they are not XML MIME entities.</t>

<t>
Application/xml and
application/xml-external-parsed-entity are recommended.
Compared to <xref target="RFC2376"/> or <xref target="RFC3023"/>, 
this specification alters the charset handling of text/xml and
text/xml-external-parsed-entity, treating them no differently from the
respective application/ types.  The 
reasons are as follows:
	<list style="empty">

	  <t>Conflicting specifications regarding the character encoding have caused
	  confusion.  
On the one hand, <xref target="RFC2046"/> specifies "The default character set, which must be
   assumed in the absence of a charset parameter, is US-ASCII.",
<xref target="RFC2616"/>
   Section 3.7.1, defines that "media subtypes of the 'text' type are
   defined to have a default charset value of 'ISO-8859-1'", and
   <xref target="RFC2376"/> as well as <xref target="RFC3023"/> 
   specify the default charset is US-ASCII.</t>
		<t>On the other hand, 
implementors and users of XML parsers, 
following Appendix F of <xref target="XML"/>, assume that the 
default is provided by the XML encoding declaration or BOM.
Note that this conflict did not exist for application/xml 
or application/xml-external-parsed-entity (see "Optional parameters" of application/xml
registration in <xref target="applicationxml"/>).</t>
<t>The current situation, reflected in this specification, has been
simplified by <xref target="RFC6657"/> updating <xref target="RFC2046"/> to
remove the US-ASCII default. Furthermore, in
  accordance with <xref target="RFC6657"/>'s other recommendations, <xref target="HTTPbis"/> changes
  <xref target="RFC2616"/> by removing the ISO-8859-1 default and not defining any
  default at all.</t>
			<t>The top-level media type "text" has some restrictions on MIME
entities and they are described in 
<xref target="RFC2045"/>
and 
<xref target="RFC2046"/>.
In particular, for transports other than <xref target="RFC2616">HTTP </xref> or HTTPS
(which uses a MIME-like mechanism).
the UTF-16 family, UCS-4, and UTF-32 are not allowed
  However, section 4.3.3 of <xref target="XML"/> says:</t>
		<t>
			<list style="empty">
				<t>"Each external parsed entity in an XML document may use a different encoding for its characters. All XML processors MUST be able to read entities in both the UTF-8 and UTF-16 encodings."</t>
			</list>
			</t>
				
				<t>Thus, although all XML processors can read entities in at least UTF-16, if an
XML document or external parsed entity is encoded in such
character encoding schemes, it could not be labeled as text/xml or
text/xml-external-parsed-entity (except for HTTP).</t>
		
		<t>It is not possible to deprecate text/xml because it is widely used in practice, and implementations are largely interoperable, following the rules of Appendix F of <xref target="XML"/> and ignoring the requirements of <xref target="RFC3023"/>.</t>

	</list>
</t>


<!--			<t>
				<list style="empty">
					<t>NOTE: Users are in general not used to text containing
tags such as &lt;price&gt;, and often find such tags quite disorienting or annoying.
If one is not sure, the conservative principle would suggest using application/*
instead of text/* so as not to put information in front of users that they will quite
likely not understand.</t>
				</list>
			</t>
-->

			<t>XML provides a general framework for defining sequences of
structured data. In some cases, it may be desirable to define new
media types that use XML but define a specific application of
XML, perhaps due to domain-specific display, editing, security considerations or
runtime information. Furthermore, such media types may allow UTF-8 or
 UTF-16 only and prohibit other charsets. This specification does not prohibit such media
types and in fact expects them to proliferate. However, developers of
such media types are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to use this specification as a basis for their registration.
			
In particular, the charset parameter, if used, MUST agree with the in-band XML encoding of the XML entity, as described in <xref target="charset"/>,
in order to enhance interoperability.</t>
			<t>An XML document labeled as application/xml or text/xml, or with a '+xml' media type, might contain
namespace declarations, stylesheet-linking processing instructions (PIs), schema information,
or other declarations that might be used to suggest how the document
is to be processed. For example, a document might have the XHTML
namespace and a reference to a CSS stylesheet. Such a document might
be handled by applications that would use this information to dispatch the document
for appropriate processing.</t>

   <section title="Charset considerations" anchor="charset">
    <t>
							The charset parameter MUST only be used, when the charset is reliably
known and agrees with the in-band XML encoding declaration. This information can be used by non-XML processors to determine authoritatively the charset of the XML MIME entity. The charset
parameter can also be used to provide protocol-specific
operations, such as charset-based content negotiation in
HTTP.</t>
						<t>"utf-8" <xref target="RFC3629"/>
and "utf-16" <xref target="RFC2781"/>
are the recommended values, representing the UTF-8 and UTF-16
charsets, respectively. These charsets are preferred since they
are supported by all conforming processors of 
<xref target="XML"/>.</t>
						<t>If an entity of one of the
types defined above is received where the charset
parameter is omitted, no information is being provided about
the charset by the MIME Content-Type header. Conforming XML
processors MUST follow the requirements in section 4.3.3 of 
<xref target="XML"/>
that directly address this contingency. However, MIME
processors that are not XML processors SHOULD NOT assume a
default charset if the charset parameter is omitted from 
such an entity.</t>
						<t>Since a receiving application can, with very high reliability,
determine the encoding of an XML document by reading it, the in-band XML encoding declaration SHOULD be provided. 

</t>
				
						<section title="Background"><t>There are several reasons that the charset parameter is
optionally allowed.  First, recent web servers have been improved so that
users can specify the charset parameter.  Second, <xref target="RFC2130"/> (informative) specifies that the recommended specification
scheme is the "charset" parameter.</t>
						<t>On the other hand, it has been
argued that the charset parameter should be omitted and the mechanism
described in Appendix F of <xref target="XML"/>  (which is non-normative) should be solely relied on.  This approach would
allow users to avoid configuration of the charset parameter; an XML
document stored in a file is likely to contain a correct encoding
declaration or BOM (if necessary), since the operating system does not
typically provide charset information for files.  If users would like
to rely on the in-band XML encoding declaration or BOM
and/or to conceal charset
information from non-XML processors,
they can omit the 
parameter.</t></section>
    
   </section>
			
		</section>
		<section title="The Byte Order Mark (BOM) and Conversions to/from the UTF-16 Charset">
			<t>Section 4.3.3 of <xref target="XML"/>
 specifies that XML MIME entities in
 the charset "utf-16" MUST begin with a byte order mark (BOM), which
 is a hexadecimal octet sequence 0xFE 0xFF (or 0xFF 0xFE, depending
 on endian). The XML Recommendation further states that the BOM is
 an encoding signature, and is not part of either the markup or the
 character data of the XML document.</t>
			<t>Due to the presence of the BOM, applications that convert XML from "utf-16"
 to a non-Unicode encoding MUST strip the BOM before
 conversion. Similarly, when converting from another encoding into
 "utf-16", the BOM MUST be added after conversion is complete.</t>
			<t>In addition to the charset "utf-16", <xref target="RFC2781"/> introduces "utf-16le" (little endian)
and "utf-16be" (big endian) as well. The BOM is prohibited for these
charsets. When an XML MIME entity is encoded in "utf-16le" or
"utf-16be", it MUST NOT begin with the BOM but SHOULD contain an
in-band XML encoding declaration. Conversion from "utf-16" to "utf-16be" or
"utf-16le" and conversion in the other direction MUST strip or add the BOM,
respectively.</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Fragment Identifiers" anchor="frag">
			<t>Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)
may contain fragment identifiers (see
Section 3.5 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>).
Likewise, Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)
<xref target="RFC3987"/>
may contain fragment identifiers.
</t>

<t>The syntax and semantics of fragment identifiers for the
	XML media types defined in this specification are based on the <xref target="XPointerFramework"/> W3C
	Recommendation.  It allows simple names, and more complex
	constructions based on named schemes.  When the syntax of a fragment
	identifier part of any URI or IRI with a retrieved media type governed
	by this specification conforms to the syntax specified in <xref target="XPointerFramework"/>, conformant applications MUST
interpret such
	fragment identifiers as designating that part of the retrieved
	representation specified by  <xref target="XPointerFramework"/> and whatever other
	specifications define any XPointer schemes used.  Conformant
	applications MUST support the 'element' scheme as defined in
	<xref target="XPointerElement"/>, but need not support other schemes.</t>
   <t>If an
XPointer error is reported in the attempt to process the part, this
specification does not define an interpretation for the part.</t>
			
	<t>A  <xref target="XPtrReg">registry 
	of XPointer schemes</xref> is maintained at the W3C. 
	Document
authors SHOULD NOT use unregistered schemes.  Scheme authors SHOULD register
their schemes.</t>

<t>See <xref target="referencing"/> for additional
rquirements which apply when an XML-based MIME media type follows the naming convention
	'+xml'.
</t>
			

<t>If <xref target="XPointerFramework"/> and <xref target="XPointerElement"/> are inappropriate for some XML-based media
type, it SHOULD NOT follow the naming convention '+xml'.</t>

<t>When a URI has a fragment identifier, it is encoded by a limited
subset of the repertoire of US-ASCII <xref target="ASCII"/>
characters, as defined in <xref target="RFC3986"/>.  When an IRI
contains a fragment identifier, it is encoded by a much wider
repertoire of characters.  The conversion between IRI fragment
identifiers and URI fragment identifiers is presented in Section 7 of
<xref target="RFC3987"/>.</t>



		</section>
		<section title="The Base URI" anchor="xmlbase">
			<t>Section 5.1 of <xref target="RFC3986"/>
specifies that the semantics of a relative URI
reference embedded in a MIME entity is dependent on the base
URI. The base URI is either (1) the base URI embedded in context, 
(2) the base URI from the encapsulating entity,
(3) the base URI from the Retrieval URI, or 
(4) the default base URI, where (1) has the
highest precedence. <xref target="RFC3986"/> further specifies that the
mechanism for embedding the base URI is dependent on the media
type.</t>

<t>The media type dependent mechanism for embedding the base URI
in a MIME entity of type application/xml, text/xml,

		<section title="A Naming Convention for XML-Based Media Types" anchor="naming">
   <t>This section supersedes <xref target="RFC6839">the earlier registration
of the '+xml' suffix</xref>.</t>
			<t>This specification recommends the use of a naming convention (a
suffix of '+xml') for identifying XML-based MIME media types,
whatever their particular content may represent, in line with the
recognition in <xref target="RFC6838"/> of structured syntax name
suffixes. This allows the
use of generic XML processors and technologies on a wide variety
of different XML document types at a minimum cost, using existing
frameworks for media type registration.</t>			
			<t>When a new media type is introduced for an XML-based format,
the name of the media type SHOULD end with '+xml'. This
convention will allow applications that can process XML
generically to detect that the MIME entity is supposed to be an
XML document, verify this assumption by invoking some XML
processor, and then process the XML document accordingly.
Applications may match for types that represent XML MIME entities by
comparing the subtype to the pattern '*/*+xml'.  (Of course, 4 of
the 5 media types defined in this specification -- text/xml,
application/xml, text/xml-external-parsed-entity, and
application/xml-external-parsed-entity -- also represent XML MIME entities
while not conforming to the '*/*+xml' pattern.)</t>
			<t>
				<list style="empty">
					<t>NOTE: Section 14.1 of 
<xref target="RFC2616">HTTP </xref>
does not support Accept headers of the form "Accept: */*+xml"
and so this header MUST NOT be used in this way. Instead,
<xref target="RFC2703">content negotiation </xref> could potentially
be used if an XML-based MIME type
were needed.</t>
				</list>
			</t>

<t>Media types following the naming convention '+xml' SHOULD introduce
the charset parameter for consistency, since XML-generic processing
applies the same program for any such media type.  However, there are
some cases that the charset parameter need not be introduced.  For
example:</t>

<t><list style="empty">

<t>When an XML-based media type is restricted to UTF-8, it is not
necessary to introduce the charset parameter.  "UTF-8 only" is a
generic principle and UTF-8 is the default of XML.</t>

<t>When an XML-based media type is restricted to UTF-8 and UTF-16, it
might not be unreasonable to omit the charset parameter.  Neither
UTF-8 nor UTF-16 require in-band XML encoding declarations.</t>


</list>
</t>

			<t>XML generic processing is not always appropriate for
XML-based media types. For example, authors of some such media
types may wish that the types remain entirely opaque except to
applications that are specifically designed to deal with that
media type. By NOT following the naming convention '+xml', such
media types can avoid XML-generic processing. Since generic
processing will be useful in many cases, however -- including in
some situations that are difficult to predict ahead of time --
those registering media types SHOULD use the '+xml' convention
unless they have a particularly compelling reason not to.</t>
			<t>The registration process for specific '+xml' media types is described in
<xref target="RFC6838"/> and <xref target="RFC6839"/>.
The registrar for the IETF tree will encourage new XML-based
media type registrations in the IETF tree to follow this
guideline. Registrars for other trees SHOULD follow this
convention in order to ensure maximum interoperability of their
XML-based documents. Similarly, media subtypes that do not
represent XML MIME entities MUST NOT be allowed to register with a
'+xml' suffix.</t>
			<section title="Referencing" anchor="referencing">
				
				<t>Registrations for new XML-based media types under top-level types SHOULD, in specifying the charset parameter and encoding considerations, define them as: "Same as [charset parameter / encoding considerations] of application/xml as specified in RFC XXXX."</t>
				<t>The use of the charset parameter is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED, since
this information can be used by XML processors to determine
authoritatively the charset of the XML MIME entity.    If there are some reasons not to follow this advice, they SHOULD be included as part of the registration.  As shown above, two such reasons are "UTF-8 only" or "UTF-8 or UTF-16 only".</t>

			<t>The examples below give the charset portion, if any, of the value of the MIME Content-type 
header and the XML declaration or Text declaration (which includes the encoding
declaration) inside the XML MIME entity. For UTF-16 examples, the
Byte Order Mark character is denoted as "{BOM}", and the XML or Text
declaration is assumed to come at the beginning of the XML MIME
entity, immediately following the BOM. Note that other MIME
headers may be present, and the XML MIME entity may contain other
data in addition to the XML declaration; the examples focus on
the Content-type header and the encoding declaration for
clarity.</t>
   <t>All the examples below apply to all five media types declared
above in <xref target="registrations"/>, as well as to any media types declared
using the '+xml' convention.  See the <xref target="xml_entities">XML
MIME entities table</xref> for discussion of which
types are appropriate for which varieties of XML MIME entities.</t>
   <t>This section is non-normative.  In particular, note that all
"MUST" language herein reproduces or summarizes the consequences of normative
statement already made above, and have no independent normative force.</t>
<section title="UTF-8 Charset" anchor="utf8">
				<t>Content-type charset: charset="utf-8"</t>
				<t>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;</t>
				<t>This is the recommended encoding for use with all the media types defined in
this specification.
Since the charset parameter is provided, both MIME and XML
processors MUST treat the enclosed entity as UTF-8 encoded.</t>
				<t>If sent using a 7-bit transport (e.g. <xref target="RFC5321">SMTP </xref>), the XML MIME entity
MUST use a content-transfer-encoding of either quoted-printable
or base64. For an 8-bit clean transport (e.g., 8BITMIME ESMTP
or NNTP), or a binary clean transport (e.g., HTTP), no
content-transfer-encoding is necessary.</t>
			</section>
			<section title="UTF-16 Charset" anchor="utf16">

				<t>For application... cases, if  sent using a 7-bit transport (e.g., SMTP) or an 8-bit
clean transport (e.g., 8BITMIME ESMTP or NNTP), the XML MIME
entity MUST be encoded in quoted-printable or base64; for a
binary clean transport (e.g., HTTP), no

    <t anchor="tx16">
As described in <xref target="RFC2781"/>,
the UTF-16 family MUST NOT be used with media types under the 
top-level type "text" except over HTTP or HTTPS (see section 19.4.1 of 
<xref target="RFC2616"/>
for details).  Hence this example is only possible in text/... cases when the XML MIME entity is
transmitted via HTTP or HTTPS, which use a MIME-like mechanism and are
binary-clean protocols, hence do not perform CR and LF
transformations and allow NUL octets.  Since HTTP is binary clean, no content-transfer-encoding is
necessary.</t>

XML-unaware MIME processors SHOULD make no assumptions about the charset of the
XML MIME entity.</t>

    <t>This example shows a 16-bit MIME entity with no charset
parameter.  Since the charset parameter is not provided in the Content-Type
header, in this case XML processors MUST treat the "utf-16" encoding and/or the BOM as authoritative. 
XML-unaware MIME processors SHOULD make no assumptions about the charset of the
XML MIME entity.</t>
				<t>Omitting the charset parameter is NOT RECOMMENDED
for application/... when used with transports other than HTTP or HTTPS---text/... SHOULD NOT
be used for 16-bit MIME with transports other than HTTP or HTTPS (see <xref target="tx16">discussion above</xref>).</t>
			</section>
   <section title="Omitted Charset, no Internal Encoding Declaration and UTF-8 Entity">
				<t>Content-type charset: [none]</t>
				<t>&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;</t>
				<t>In this example, the charset parameter has been omitted, the is
no internal encoding declaration, and
there is no BOM. Since there is no BOM, the XML processor
follows the requirements in section 4.3.3, and optionally
applies the mechanism described in Appendix F (which is
non-normative) of 
<xref target="XML"/> 
to determine the charset encoding of UTF-8.
Although the XML MIME entity does
not contain an encoding declaration, the encoding
actually <spanx>is</spanx>
UTF-8, so this is still a conforming XML MIME entity.</t>
				<t>An XML-unaware MIME processor SHOULD make no assumptions
about the charset of the XML MIME entity.</t>

   <section title="UTF-16BE Charset">
				<t>Content-type charset: charset="utf-16be"</t>
				<t>&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-16be'?&gt;</t>
				<t>Observe that the BOM does not exist. Since the charset
 parameter is provided, MIME and XML processors MUST treat the
 enclosed entity as UTF-16BE encoded.</t>
    <t>See also the additional considerations in <xref target="utf16">the UTF-16
example</xref> above.</t>
			</section>
			
   <section title="Non-UTF Charset">
				<t>Content-type charset: charset="iso-2022-kr"</t>
				<t>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-2022-kr"?&gt;</t>
				<t>This example shows the use of a non-UTF charset
(in this case Hangul, but this example
is intended to cover all non-UTF-family charsets).
Since the charset parameter is provided, MIME 
processors MUST treat the enclosed entity as encoded per RFC 1557. Since  the XML MIME entity has an internal
encoding declaration (this example does show such a
declaration, which agrees with the charset parameter) XML processors MUST also treat the enclosed entity as encoded per RFC 1557. Thus, interoperability is assured.</t>
				<t>Since ISO-2022-KR <xref target="RFC1557"/> has been defined to use only 7 bits of
data, no content-transfer-encoding is necessary with any
transport: for charsets needing 8 or more bits, considerations such as
those discussed above (<xref target="utf8"/>, <xref target="utf16"/>) would apply.</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Omitted Charset with Internal Encoding Declaration">
				<t>Content-type charset: [none]</t>
				<t>&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding="iso-10646-ucs-4"?&gt;</t>
				<t>In this example, the charset parameter has been omitted, and
there is no BOM. However, the XML MIME entity does have an
encoding declaration inside the XML MIME entity that specifies
the entity's charset. Following the requirements in section
4.3.3, and optionally applying the mechanism described in
Appendix F (non-normative) of 
<xref target="XML"/>,
the XML processor determines the charset
encoding of the XML MIME entity (in this example, UCS-4).</t>
				<t>An XML-unaware MIME processor SHOULD make no assumptions
about the charset of the XML MIME entity.</t>
    <t>For charsets needing 8 or more bits, considerations such as
those discussed above (<xref target="utf8"/>, <xref target="utf16"/>) would apply</t>

				<t>Content-type charset: charset="utf-8"</t>
				<t>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?&gt;</t>
				<t>Since the charset parameter is provided in the Content-Type header and differs from the XML encoding declaration, MIME and XML
processors will not interoperate. MIME processors will treat the enclosed entity as UTF-8 encoded. That is, the "iso-8859-1" encoding will be ignored. XML processors on the other hand will ignore the charset parameter and treat the XML entity as encoded in iso-8859-1.</t>
				<t>Processors generating XML MIME entities MUST NOT label conflicting charset
information between the MIME Content-Type and the
XML declaration. In particular, the addition of an explicit, site-wide charset
without inspecting the XML MIME entity 
has frequently lead to interoperability problems.</t>

		<section title="IANA Considerations">
			<t>As described in <xref target="naming"/>, this specification updates the <xref target="RFC6838"/> and <xref target="RFC6839"/>  registration process for XML-based MIME types.</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
			
			<t>XML MIME entities contain information which may be parsed and
further processed by the recipient's XML system. These entities may
contain and such systems may permit explicit system level
commands to be executed while processing the data. To the extent
that an XML system will execute arbitrary command strings,
recipients of XML MIME entities may be a risk. In general, it
may be possible to specify commands that perform unauthorized
file operations or make changes to the display processor's
environment that affect subsequent operations.</t>
			<t>
In general, any information stored outside of the direct control of the user -- including CSS style sheets, XSL transformations, XML-entity declarations, and DTDs -- can be a source of insecurity, by either obvious or subtle means. For example, a tiny "whiteout attack" modification made to a "master" style sheet could make words in critical locations disappear in user documents, without directly modifying the user document or the stylesheet it references.  Thus, the security of any XML document is vitally dependent on all of the documents recursively referenced by that document.</t>
			<t>
The XML-entity lists and DTDs for <xref target="XHTML">XHTML 1.0 </xref>, for instance, are likely to be a commonly used set of information. Many developers will use and trust them, few of whom will know much about the level of security on the W3C's servers, or on any similarly trusted repository.</t>
			<t>
The simplest attack involves adding declarations that break validation. Adding extraneous declarations to a list of character XML-entities can effectively "break the contract" used by documents. A tiny change that produces a fatal error in a DTD could halt XML processing on a large scale. Extraneous declarations are fairly obvious, but more sophisticated tricks, like changing attributes from being optional to required, can be difficult to track down. Perhaps the most dangerous option available to crackers is redefining default values for attributes: e.g., if developers have relied on defaulted attributes for security, a relatively small change might expose enormous quantities of information.</t>
			<t>
			Apart from the structural possibilities, another option, "XML-entity spoofing,"
can be used to insert text into documents, vandalizing and perhaps conveying an
unintended message. Because XML permits multiple XML-entity
 declarations, and the first declaration takes precedence, it's possible to insert malicious content where an XML-entity reference is used, such as by inserting the full text of Winnie the Pooh in every occurrence of &amp;mdash;.</t>
			
			
			<t>Security considerations will vary by domain of use. For
example, XML medical records will have much more stringent
privacy and security considerations than XML library metadata.
Similarly, use of XML as a parameter marshalling syntax
necessitates a case by case security review.</t>
			<t>XML may also have some of the same security concerns as plain
text. Like plain text, XML can contain escape sequences that,
when displayed, have the potential to change the display
processor environment in ways that adversely affect subsequent
operations. Possible effects include, but are not limited to,
locking the keyboard, changing display parameters so subsequent
displayed text is unreadable, or even changing display parameters
to deliberately obscure or distort subsequent displayed material
so that its meaning is lost or altered. Display processors SHOULD
either filter such material from displayed text or else make sure
to reset all important settings after a given display operation
is complete.</t>
			<t>Some terminal devices have keys whose output, when pressed,
can be changed by sending the display processor a character
sequence. If this is possible the display of a text object
containing such character sequences could reprogram keys to
perform some illicit or dangerous action when the key is
subsequently pressed by the user. In some cases not only can keys
be programmed, they can be triggered remotely, making it possible
for a text display operation to directly perform some unwanted
action. As such, the ability to program keys SHOULD be blocked
either by filtering or by disabling the ability to program keys
entirely.</t>
			<t>Note that it is also possible to construct XML documents that
make use of what XML terms "[XML-]entity references"
to construct repeated expansions of
text. Recursive expansions are prohibited by 
<xref target="XML"/> 
and XML processors are required to detect them. However, even
non-recursive expansions may cause problems with the finite
computing resources of computers, if they are performed many
times.  (XML-entity A consists of 100 copies of XML-entity B, which in turn consists of 100 copies of XML-entity C, and so on)</t>

			<section title="Why Use the '+xml' Suffix for XML-Based MIME Types?" anchor="suffix_explanation">
    <t><xref target="RFC3023"/> contains a detailed discussion of the (at
the time) novel use of a suffix, a practice which has since become widespread. 
Interested parties are referred to <xref target="RFC3023"/>, Appendix A.</t>
			
			
		</section>
		<section title="Changes from RFC 3023">
			<t>There are numerous and significant differences between this specification and
<xref target="RFC3023"/>, which it obsoletes.  This appendix summarizes the major 
differences only.</t>
			<t>First, XPointer (<xref target="XPointerFramework"/> and <xref target="XPointerElement"/> 
				has been added as fragment identifier syntax for 
				"application/xml", and the XPointer Registry (<xref target="XPtrReg"/>) mentioned.
Second, <xref target="XBase"/> has been added as a mechanism for 
specifying
base URIs.  Third, the language regarding charsets was updated to correspond to
the W3C TAG finding 
<xref target="TAGMIME">Internet Media Type registration, consistency of use</xref>.
				Fourth, many references are updated, and the existence and relevance of XML
1.1 acknowledged.  Finally, a number of
justifications and contextualizations which were appropriate when XML was new
have been removed, including the whole of the original Appendix A.
