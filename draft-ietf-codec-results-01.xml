    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>This document describes and examines listening test results obtained
      for the Opus codec. Some of the test results presented are based on
      older versions of the codec or on older versions of the SILK or CELT
      components. While they do not necessarily represent the exact quality of
      the current version, they are nonetheless useful for validating the
      technology used and as an indication of a lower bound on quality (based
      on the assumption that the codec has been improved since they were
      performed).</t>

      <t>Throughout this document, all statements about one codec being better
      than or worse than another codec are based on 95% confidence. When no
      statistically significant difference can be shown with 95% confidence,
      then two codecs are said to be "tied".</t>

      <t>In addition to the results summarized in this draft, Opus has been
      subjected to many informal subjective listening tests, as well as
      objective testing.</t>

    <section anchor="opus" title="Opus listening tests on final bit-stream">
      <t>The following tests were performed on the Opus codec <spanx
      style="emph">after</spanx> the bit-stream was finalized.</t>

      <section anchor="opus-google" title="Google listening tests">
        <t>The tests followed the MUSHRA test methodology. Two anchors were
        used, one lowpass-filtered at 3.5 kHz and one lowpass-filtered at 7.0
        kHz. Both trained and untrained listeners participated in the tests.
        The reference signals were manually normalized to the same subjective
        levels according to the experimenters' opinion. Experiments with
        automatic normalization with respect to both level and loudness (in
        Adobe Audition) did not result in signals having equal subjective
        loudness. The sample magnitude levels were kept lower than 2^14 to
        provide headroom for possible amplification through the codecs.
        However, the normalization exercise was not repeated with the
        processed sequences as neither the experimenters nor any of the
        subjects (which included expert listeners) noticed any significant
        level differences between the conditions in the tests. The only
        post-processing performed was to remove noticeable delays in the MP3
        files, as one could identify the MP3 samples when switching between
        conditions when the MP3 had the longer delay. The testing tool Step
        from ARL was used for tests and all listeners were instructed to to
        carefully listen through the conditions before starting the grading.
        The results of the tests are a available on the testing slides <xref
        target="Prague-80"> presented at the Prague meeting</xref>.</t>

        <section anchor="opus-google-narrowband"
                 title="Google narrowband listening test">
          <t>The test sequences in Test 1 were mono recordings (between 2 and
          6 seconds long) of 4 different male and 4 different female speakers
          sampled at 48 kHz in low background noise. 17 listeners were
          presented with 6 stimuli according to <xref
          target="narrowband-conditions"></xref> for each test sequence. The
          corresponding bit rate for the reference is 48000 (sampling
          frequency in Hz) x 16 (bits/sample) = 768 kbps. Since the anchors
          are low-pass filtered they can also be downsampled for transmission
          which corresponds to lower bit rates. Three narrowband codecs were
          compared in this test: Opus NB, the royalty-free iLBC, and the
          royalty-free Speex. The codecs all have an encoder frame length of
          20 ms. Both Opus and Speex had variable rate whereas iLBC operated
          at a fixed bit rate.</t>

          suggest that Opus at 11 kbps is superior to both iLBC at 15 kpbs and
          Speex at 11 kbps. T-tests performed by Greg Maxwell confirm that
          there is indeed a statistically significant difference. Note also
          that Opus has a slightly higher average score than the 3.5 kHz
          anchor, likely due to the higher bandwidth of Opus.</t>

          <t>The eight test sequences for the previous test were also used in
          this Test. 16 listeners rated the stimuli listed in Table 2. In this
          test comparisons were made between four wideband codecs: Opus WB,
          the royalty-free Speex, the royalty-free ITU-T G.722.1, AMR-WB
          (ITU-T G.722.2), and two fullband codecs: Opus FB and the
          royalty-free ITU-T G.719. All six codecs utilize 20 ms encoding
          frames. Opus used variable bitrate, while other codecs used constant
          bit rate.</t>

          <t>These sequences were originally recorded at a sampling frequency
          of 44.1 kHz and were upsampled to 48 kHz prior to processing. Test 3
          included comparisons between six codecs (c.f., Table 3): Opus at
          three rates, G.719, AAC-LC (Nero 1.5.1), and MP3 (Lame 3.98.4).
          G.719 is a mono codec, so the two channels were each coded
          independently at 32 kbps. 9 listeners participated in Test 3, and
          the results are depicted in the Prague meeting slides<xref
          target="Prague-80"></xref>. The codecs operated at constant (or
          comparable) bit rate.</t>

          <t>Under the given statistical confidence, narrowband tandem coding
          condition using AMR and/or Opus are of similar quality. However, the
          results have indications that Opus outperforms AMR NB slightly. In
          any case, narrow band transcoding is worse than a low pass filtering
          at 3.5kbps.</t>

          <t>Opus at 20kbps outperforms AMR WB at a similar coding rate and
          matches the quality of a 7kHz lowpass filtered signal. Tandem coding
          with Opus does not reduce the quality of AMR WB encoded speech in
          the studied conditions.</t>

          <t>Modern Standard Chinese - also called Mandarin - is a tonal

          <t>Under the given confidence intervals, the quality of Opus at 11
          kbps equals the quality of iLBC at 15 kbps and the quality
          aferlowpass filtering at 3.5 kHz. Speex at 11 kbps does not perform
          as well. According to the listening-only tests, Opus at 32 kbps is
          better than G.719 at 32 kbps. Opus at 20 kbps outperforms G.722.1
          and Speex at 24 kbps. If one compares the Mandarin results with
          those for English (<xref target="opus-google-narrowband"></xref> and
          <xref target="opus-google-wideband"></xref>), one can see that are
          pretty consistent. The only difference is that using English stimuli
          Opus at 20 kbps outperforms G.719 at 32 kbps. Probabily, this is due
          to the fact that Mandarin speech does not contain as many high
          frequency-rich consonants such as [s] as English.</t>

        <t>The results show Opus clearly out-performing both G.722.1C and
        G.719 on clean speech at 24 kb/s and above, while on noisy speech all
        codecs and bit-rates above 24 kb/s are very close. It is also found
        that the Opus hybrid mode at 28 kb/s has quality that is very close to
        the recent G.718B standard at the same rate. At 20 kb/s, the Opus
        wideband mode also out-performs AMR-WB, while the situation is
        reversed for 12 kb/s and below. The only narrowband rate tested is 6
        kb/s, which is below what Opus targets and unsurprisingly shows poorer

    <section title="Conclusion on the requirements">
      <t>The requirements call for the Opus codec to be better than Speex and
      iLBC in narrowband mode, better than Speex and G.722.1 in wideband mode,
      and better than G.722.1C in super-wideband/fullband mode.</t>

      <section title="Comparison to Speex (narrowband)">
        <t>The Opus codec was compared to Speex in narrowband mode in the
        <xref target="opus-google-narrowband">Google narrowband test</xref>.
        This test showed that Opus at 11 kb/s was significantly better than
        Speex at the same rate. In fact, Opus at 11 kb/s was tied with the 3.5
        low-pass of the original. Considering the results, we conclude that
        the Opus codec is better than the Speex codec.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Comparison to iLBC">
        <t>The Opus codec was compared to iLBC in the <xref
        target="opus-google-narrowband">Google narrowband test</xref>. This
        test showed that Opus at 11 kb/s was significantly better than iLBC
        running at 15 kb/s. Considering the results, we conclude that the Opus
        codec is better than the iLBC codec.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Comparison to Speex (wideband)">
        <t>The Opus codec was compared to Speex in wideband mode in the <xref
        target="opus-google-wideband">Google wideband and fullband
        test</xref>. This test showed that Opus at 20 kb/s was significantly
        better than Speex at at 24 kb/s. In fact, Opus at 20 kb/s was better
        than the 7 kHz low-pass of the original. These results are consistent
        with an earlier <xref target="silk-dynastat">Dynastat test</xref> that
        also concluded that SILK had significantly higher quality than Speex
        in wideband mode at the same bit-rate. Considering the results, we
        conclude that the Opus codec is better than the Speex codec for
        wideband.</t>

      <section title="Comparison to G.722.1">
        <t>In the <xref target="opus-google-wideband">Google wideband and
        fullband test</xref>, Opus at 20 kb/s was shown to significantly
        out-perform G.722.1 operating at 24 kb/s. An indirect comparison point
        also comes from the <xref target="nokia-2011">Nokia Interspeech 2011
        listening test</xref> that shows Opus out-performing AMR-WB at 20
        kb/s, while AMR-WB is known to out-perform G.722.1. Considering these
        results, we conclude that the Opus codec is better than the G.722.1
        codec for wideband.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Comparison to G.722.1C">
        <t>Opus has been compared to G.722.1C in multiple listening tests. As
        early as 2008, an <xref target="celt-aslp">old version of the CELT
        codec</xref> using very short frames was found to have higher quality
        than G.722.1C at 48 kb/s. More recently, the <xref
        target="nokia-2011">Nokia Interspeech 2011 listening test</xref>
        showed that Opus out-performed G.722.1C at 24 kb/s, 32 kb/s, and 48
        kb/s. We thus conclude that the Opus codec is better than the G.722.1C
        codec for superwideband/fullband audio.</t>

      <section title="Comparison to AMR-NB">
        <t>In the <xref target="opus-google-narrowband">Google narrowband

        listening test</xref>, AMB-NB was found to have better quality than
        Opus at 6 kb/s. This indicates that Opus is better than AMR-NB at
        higher rates and worse at lower rates, which is to be expected given
        Opus' emphasis on higher quality and higher rates.</t>

      <t>Several listening tests have been performed on the SILK and CELT
      codecs prior to them being merged as part of the Opus codec.</t>

      <section anchor="silk-dynastat" title="SILK Dynastat listening test">
        <t>The original (pre-Opus) SILK codec was characterized in a <xref
        target="SILK-Dynastat">Dynastat listening test</xref>. The test
        included 32 conditions with 4 male and 4 female talkers. The test
        signals were wideband speech with and without office background noise
        at 15 dB SNR. Packet loss was tested at 2, 5, and 10% loss rates. The
        bitrates ranged from 8.85 kb/s to 64 kb/s. The codecs included in the
        test were SILK-WB, AMR-WB, Speex-WB and G.722 (which ran at 64
        kb/s).</t>

        <t>The results showed that for clean speech (1) SILK out-performs
        AMR-WB at all bit-rates except 8.85 kb/s (which was a tie); (2) SILK
        out-performs Speex at all bit-rates; and (3) SILK running at 18.25
        kb/s and above out-performs G.722 at 64 kbps. For noisy speech, tested
        at 18.25 kb/s, SILK is tied with AMR-WB, and out-performs Speex. For
        2, 5 and 10% packet loss, tested at 18.25 kb/s, SILK out-performs both
        AMR-WB and Speex in all conditions.</t>

      <section anchor="silk-nokia" title="SILK Nokia test">
        <t>In 2010, Anssi Ramo from Nokia <xref
        target="Ramo2010">presented</xref> the results of a listening test
        focusing on open-source codecs at Interspeech 2010. The methodology
        used was a 9-scale ACR MOS test with clean and noisy speech
        samples.</t>

        <t>It was noted in the test that:</t>

        <t>"Especially at around 16 kbit/s or above Silk is better than AMR-WB
        at comparable bitrates. This is due to the fact that Silk wideband is
        critically sampled up to 8 kHz instead of ITU- T or 3GPP defined 7
        kHz. This added bandwidth (from 7 to 8 kHz) shows up in the results
        favourable to Silk. It seems that Silk provides quite artifact free
        voice quality for the whole 16- 24 kbit/s range with WB signals. At 32
        and 40 kbit/s Silk is SWB and competes quite equally against G.718B or
        G.722.1C although having a slightly narrower bandwidth than the ITU-T
        standardized codecs."</t>

      <section anchor="celt-aslp" title="CELT 0.3.2 listening test">
        <t>The first listening tests conducted on CELT version 0.3.2 in 2009
        and <xref target="valin2010">published in 2010</xref> included AAC-LD
        (Apple), G.722.1C and MP3 (Lame). Two MUSHRA tests were conducted: a
        48 kb/s test and a 64 kb/s test, both at a 44.1 kHz sampling rate.
        CELT was used with 256-sample frames (5.8 ms). All codecs used
        constant bit-rate (CBR). The algorithmic delay was 8.7 ms for CELT,
        34.8 ms for AAC-LD, 40 ms for G.722.1C and more than 100 ms for
        MP3.</t>

        <t>The 48 kb/s test included two clean speech samples (one male, one
        female) from the EBU SQAM database, four clean speech files (two male,
        two female) from the NTT multi-lingual speech database for
        telephonometry, and two music samples. In this test, CELT
        out-performed AAC-LD, G.722.1C and MP3.</t>

        <t>The 64 kb/s test included two clean speech samples (one male, one
        female) from the EBU SQAM database, and six music files. In this test,
        AAC-LD out-performed CELT, but CELT out-performed both MP3 and
        G.722.1C (running at its highest rate of 48 kb/s).</t>

      <t>The following listening tests were conducted on the Opus codec on

      <section anchor="opus-maastricht" title="First hybrid mode test">
        <t>In July 2010, the Opus codec authors conducted a preliminary MUSHRA
        listening test to evaluate the quality of the recently created
        "hybrid" mode combining the SILK and CELT codecs. That test was
        conducted at 32 kb/s and compared the following codecs: <list
            style="symbols">
            <t>Opus hybrid mode (fullband)</t>

            <t>G.719 (fullband)</t>

            <t>BroadVoice32 (wideband)</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The test material consisted of two English speech samples from the
        EBU SQAM (one male, one female) database and six speech samples (three
        male, three female) from the NTT multi-lingual speech database for
        telephonometry. Although only eight listeners participated to the
        test, the difference between the Opus hybrid mode and all other codecs
        was large enough to obtain 95% confidence that the Opus hybrid mode
        provided better quality than all other codecs tested. This test is of
        interest because it shows that the hybrid clearly out-performs the
        codecs that it combines (SILK and CELT). It also out-performs G.719,
        which is the only fullband interactive codec standardized by the
        ITU-T. These results were <xref target="Maastricht-78">

      <section anchor="opus-broadcom" title="Broadcom stereo music test">
        <t>In December 2010, Broadcom conducted an ITU-R BS.1116-style
        subjective listening test comparing different configurations of the
        CELT-only mode of the IETF Opus codec along with MP3 and AAC-LC. The
        test included stereo 10 audio samples sampled at 44.1 kHz and
        distributed as follows: <list style="symbols">
            <t>2 pure speech</t>

        <t>A total of 17 listeners participated to the test. The results of
        the test are a available on the testing slides <xref
        target="Prague-80"> presented at the Prague meeting</xref>. Although
        at the time, Opus was not properly optimised for 44.1 kHz audio, the
        quality of the Opus codec at 96 kb/s with 22 ms frame was
        significantly better than MP3 and only slightly worse than AAC-LC.
        Even in ultra low-delay mode (5.4 ms), Opus still outperformed MP3.
        The test also confirmed the usefulness of the prefilter/postfilter
        contribution by Raymond Chen, showing that this contribution
        significantly improves quality for small frames (long frames were not
        tested with the prefilter/postfilter disabled).</t>
