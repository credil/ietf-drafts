Internet-Draft                   RTC-Web                    October 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document presents a few use-cases of web applications that are
   executed in a browser and use real-time communication capabilities.
   In most of the use-cases all end-user clients are web applications,
   but there are some use-cases where at least one of the end-user
   client is of another type (e.g. a telephone).

   Based on the use-cases, the document derives requirements related to
   browser functionality.  These requirements are named "Fn", where n is
   an integer, and are described in Section 4.2.

   This document was developed in an initial phase of the work with
   rather minor updates at later stages.  It has not really served as a
   tool in deciding features or scope for the WGs efforts so far.  It is
   proposed to be used in a later phase to evaluate the protocols and
   solutions developed by the WG.

   This document also lists requirements related to the API to be used
   by web applications as an appendix.  The reason is that the W3C
   WebRTC WG has decided to not develop its own use-case/requirement
   document, but instead use this document.  These requirements are
   named "An", where n is an integer, and are described in Appendix A-

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

3.  Use-cases

3.1.  Introduction

   This section describes web based real-time communication use-cases,
   from which requirements are derived.

   The following considerations are applicable to all use cases:

   o  Clients can be on IPv4-only

   o  Clients can be on IPv6-only

   o  Clients can be on dual-stack

   o  Clients can be connected to networks with different throughput
      capabilities

Internet-Draft                   RTC-Web                    October 2013


   o  Clients can be on variable-media-quality networks (wireless)

   o  Clients can be on congested networks

   o  Clients can be on firewalled networks with no UDP allowed

   o  Clients can be on networks with a NAT using any type of Mapping
      and Filtering behaviors (as described in RFC4787).

3.2.  Common requirements

   The requirements retrived from the "Simple Video Communication
   Service" by default apply to all other use-cases, and are considred
   common.  For each individual use-case, only the additional
   requirements are listed.  The following requirements can be retrieved
   from, and apply to, each of the documented use-cases.  For each
   individual use-case, only requirements that are not part of the
   common requirements are listed.

3.3.  Browser-to-browser use-cases

3.3.1.  Simple Video Communication Service

3.3.1.1.  Description

   Two or more users have loaded a video communication web application
   into their browsers, provided by the same service provider, and
   logged into the service it provides.  The web service publishes
   information about user login status by pushing updates to the web
   application in the browsers.  When one online user selects a peer
   online user, a 1-1 audiovisual communication session between the
   browsers of the two peers is initiated.  The invited user might
   accept or reject the session.

   During session establishment a self-view is displayed, and once the
   session has been established the video sent from the remote peer is
   displayed in addition to the self-view.  During the session, each
   user can select to remove and re-insert the self-view as often as
   desired.  Each user can also change the sizes of his/her two video
   displays during the session.  Each user can also pause sending of
   media (audio, video, or both) and mute incoming media

   It is essential that media and data be encrypted, authenticated and
   integrity protected on a per-packet basis and that media and data
   packets failing the integrity check not be delivered to the
   application.

   The application gives the users the opportunity to stop it from
   exposing the host IP address to the application of the other user.

   Any session participant can end the session at any time.

   The two users may be using communication devices of different makes,
   with different operating systems and browsers from different vendors.

   The web service monitors the quality of the service (focus on quality
   of audio and video) the end-users experience.

3.3.1.2.  Common Requirements

   F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F8, F9, F10, F20, F25, F28, F35, F36, F38, F39

   A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, A10, A11, A12, A25, A26

3.3.2.  Simple Video Communication Service, NAT/FW that blocks UDP

3.3.2.1.  Description

   This use-case is almost identical to the Simple Video Communication
   Service use-case (Section 3.3.1).  The difference is that one of the
   users is behind a NAT that blocks UDP traffic.

3.3.2.2.  Additional Requirements

   F29

3.3.3.  Simple Video Communication Service, FW that only allows http

3.3.3.1.  Description

   This use-case is almost identical to the Simple Video Communication
   Service use-case (Section 3.3.1).  The difference is that one of the
   users is behind a FW that only allows traffic via a HTTP Proxy.

3.3.3.2.  Additional Requirements

   F37

3.3.4.  Simple Video Communication Service, global service provider

3.3.4.1.  Description

   This use-case is almost identical to the Simple Video Communication
   Service use-case (Section 3.3.1).

   What is added is that the service provider is operating over large
   geographical areas (or even globally).

   Assuming that ICE will be used, this means that the service provider
   would like to be able to provide several STUN and TURN servers (via
   the app) to the browser; selection of which one(s) to use is part of
   the ICE processing.  Other reasons for wanting to provide several
   STUN and TURN servers include support for IPv4 and IPv6, load
   balancing and redundancy.

3.3.4.2.  Additional Requirements

   F31

   A22

3.3.5.  Simple Video Communication Service, enterprise aspects

3.3.5.1.  Description

   This use-case is similar to the Simple Video Communication Service
   use-case (Section 3.3.1).

   What is added is aspects when using the service in enterprises.  ICE
   is assumed in the further description of this use-case.

   An enterprise that uses a RTCWEB based web application for
   communication desires to audit all RTCWEB based application session
   used from inside the company towards any external peer.  To be able
   to do this they deploy a TURN server that straddle the boundary
   between the internal network and the external.

   The firewall will block all attempts to use STUN with an external
   destination unless they go to the enterprise auditing TURN server.
   In cases where employees are using RTCWEB applications provided by an
   external service provider they still want to have the traffic to stay
   inside their internal network and in addition not load the straddling
   TURN server, thus they deploy a STUN server allowing the RTCWEB
   client to determine its server reflexive address on the internal
   side.  Thus enabling cases where peers are both on the internal side
   to connect without the traffic leaving the internal network.  It must
   be possible to configure the browsers used in the enterprise with
   network specific STUN and TURN servers.  This should be possible to

   achieve by auto-configuration methods.  The RTCWEB functionality will
   need to utilize both network specific STUN and TURN resources and
   STUN and TURN servers provisioned by the web application.

3.3.5.2.  Additional Requirements

   F32

3.3.6.  Simple Video Communication Service, access change

3.3.6.1.  Description

   This use-case is almost identical to the Simple Video Communication
   Service use-case (Section 3.3.1).  The difference is that the user
   changes network access during the session:

   The communication device used by one of the users have several
   network adapters (Ethernet, WiFi, Cellular).  The communication
   device is accessing the Internet using Ethernet, but the user has to
   start a trip during the session.  The communication device
   automatically changes to use WiFi when the Ethernet cable is removed
   and then moves to cellular access to the Internet when moving out of
   WiFi coverage.  The session continues even though the access method
   changes.

3.3.6.2.  Additional Requirements

   F26

3.3.7.  Simple Video Communication Service, QoS

3.3.7.1.  Description

   This use-case is almost identical to the Simple Video Communication
   Service, access change use-case (Section 3.3.6).  The use of Quality
   of Service (QoS) capabilities is added:

   The user in the previous use case that starts a trip is behind a
   common residential router that supports prioritization of traffic.
   In addition, the user's provider of cellular access has QoS support
   enabled.  The user is able to take advantage of the QoS support both
   when accessing via the residential router and when using cellular.

   F24, F26

3.3.8.  Simple Video Communication Service with sharing

3.3.8.1.  Description

   This use-case has the audio and video communication of the Simple
   Video Communication Service use-case (Section 3.3.1).

   But in addition to this, one of the users can share what is being
   displayed on her/his screen with a peer.  The user can choose to
   share the entire screen, part of the screen (part selected by the
   user) or what a selected application displays with the peer.

3.3.8.2.  Additional Requirements

   F30

   A21

3.3.9.  Simple Video Communication Service with file exchange

3.3.9.1.  Description

   This use-case has the audio and video communication of the Simple
   Video Communication Service use-case (Section 3.3.1).

   But in addition to this, the users can send and receive files stored
   in the file system of the device used.

3.3.9.2.  Additional Requirements

   F30, F33

   A21, A24

3.3.10.  Hockey Game Viewer

3.3.10.1.  Description

   An ice-hockey club uses an application that enables talent scouts to,
   in real-time, show and discuss games and players with the club
   manager.  The talent scouts use a mobile phone with two cameras, one
   front facing and one rear facing.





Holmberg, et al.         Expires April 17, 2014                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                   RTC-Web                    October 2013


   The club manager uses a desktop, equipped with one camera, for
   viewing the game and discussing with the talent scout.

   Before the game starts, and during game breaks, the talent scout and
   the manager have a 1-1 audiovisual communication session.  On the
   mobile phone, only the camera facing the talent scout is used.  On
   the user display of the mobile phone, the video of the club manager
   is shown with a picture-in-picture thumbnail of the rear facing
   camera (self-view).  On the display of the desktop, the video of the
   talent scout is shown with a picture-in-picture thumbnail of the
   desktop camera (self-view).

   When the game is on-going, the talent scout activates the use of the
   front facing camera, and that stream is sent to the desktop (the
   stream from the rear facing camera continues to be sent all the
   time).  The video stream captured by the front facing camera (that is
   capturing the game) of the mobile phone is shown in a big window on
   the desktop screen, with picture-in-picture thumbnails of the rear
   facing camera and the desktop camera (self-view).  On the display of
   the mobile phone the game is shown (front facing camera) with
   picture-in-picture thumbnails of the rear facing camera (self-view)
   and the desktop camera.  As the most important stream in this phase
   is the video showing the game, the application used in the talent
   scout's mobile sets higher priority for that stream.

3.3.10.2.  Additional Requirements

   F17, F34

   A17, A23

3.3.11.  Multiparty video communication

3.3.11.1.  Description

   In this use-case is the Simple Video Communication Service use-case
   (Section 3.3.1) is extended by allowing multiparty sessions.  No
   central server is involved - the browser of each participant sends
   and receives streams to and from all other session participants.  The
   web application in the browser of each user is responsible for
   setting up streams to all receivers.

   In order to enhance intelligibility, the web application pans the
   audio from different participants differently when rendering the
   audio.  This is done automatically, but users can change how the
   different participants are placed in the (virtual) room.  In addition
   the levels in the audio signals are adjusted before mixing.

Internet-Draft                   RTC-Web                    October 2013


   Another feature intended to enhance the use experience is that the
   video window that displays the video of the currently speaking peer
   is highlighted.

   Each video stream received is by default displayed in a thumbnail
   frame within the browser, but users can change the display size.

   Note: What this use-case adds in terms of requirements is
   capabilities to send streams to and receive streams from several
   peers concurrently, as well as the capabilities to render the video
   from all received streams and be able to spatialize, level adjust and
   mix the audio from all received streams locally in the browser.  It
   also adds the capability to measure the audio level/activity.

3.3.11.2.  Additional Requirements

   F11, F12, F13, F14, F15, F16, F17

   A13, A14, A15, A16, A17

3.3.12.  Multiparty on-line game with voice communication

3.3.12.1.  Description

   This use case is based on the previous one.  In this use-case, the
   voice part of the multiparty video communication use case is used in
   the context of an on-line game.  The received voice audio media is
   rendered together with game sound objects.  For example, the sound of
   a tank moving from left to right over the screen must be rendered and
   played to the user together with the voice media.

   Quick updates of the game state is required, and have higher priority
   than the voice.

   Note: the difference regarding local audio processing compared to the
   "Multiparty video communication" use-case is that other sound objects
   than the streams must be possible to be included in the
   spatialization and mixing.  "Other sound objects" could for example
   be a file with the sound of the tank; that file could be stored
   locally or remotely.

3.4.  Browser - GW/Server use cases

3.4.1.  Telephony terminal

3.4.1.1.  Description

   A mobile telephony operator allows its customers to use a web browser
   to access their services.  After a simple log in the user can place
   and receive calls in the same way as when using a normal mobile
   phone.  When a call is received or placed, the identity is shown in
   the same manner as when a mobile phone is used.

   Note: With "place and receive calls in the same way as when using a
   normal mobile phone" it is meant that you can dial a number, and that
   your mobile telephony operator has made available your phone contacts
   on line, so they are available and can be clicked to call, and be
   used to present the identity of an incoming call.  If the callee is
   not in your phone contacts the number is displayed.  Furthermore,
   your call logs are available, and updated with the calls made/
   received from the browser.  And for people receiving calls made from
   the web browser the usual identity (i.e. the phone number of the
   mobile phone) will be presented.

3.4.3.1.  Description

   An organization uses a video communication system that supports the
   establishment of multiparty video sessions using a central conference
   server.

   The browser of each participant send an audio stream (type in terms
   of mono, stereo, 5.1, ... depending on the equipment of the
   participant) to the central server.  The central server mixes the
   audio streams (and can in the mixing process naturally add effects
   such as spatialization) and sends towards each participant a mixed
   audio stream which is played to the user.

   The browser of each participant sends video towards the server.  For
   each participant one high resolution video is displayed in a large
   window, while a number of low resolution videos are displayed in
   smaller windows.  The server selects what video streams to be
   forwarded as main- and thumbnail videos respectively, based on speech
   activity.  As the video streams to display can change quite
   frequently (as the conversation flows) it is important that the delay
   from when a video stream is selected for display until the video can
   be displayed is short.

   All participants are authenticated by the central server, and
   authorized to connect to the central server.  The participants are
   identified to each other by the central server, and the participants
   do not have access to each others' credentials such as e-mail
   addresses or login IDs.

   Note: This use-case adds requirements on support for fast stream
   switches F7, on encryption of media and on ability to traverse very
   restrictive FWs.  There exist several solutions that enable the
   server to forward one high resolution and several low resolution
   video streams: a) each browser could send a high resolution, but
   scalable stream, and the server could send just the base layer for
   the low resolution streams, b) each browser could in a simulcast
   fashion send one high resolution and one low resolution stream, and
   the server just selects or c) each browser sends just a high
   resolution stream, the server transcodes into low resolution streams
   as required.

4.  Requirements

4.1.  General

   This section contains the requirements on the browser derived from
   the use-cases in Section 3.

   NOTE: It is assumed that the user applications are executed on a
   browser.  Whether the capabilities to implement specific browser
   requirements are implemented by the browser application, or are
   provided to the browser application by the underlying operating
   system, is outside the scope of this document.

4.2.  Browser requirements

   F2      The browser must be able to send streams and
           data to a peer in the presence  of NATs.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   F3      Transmitted streams and data must be rate
           controlled (meaning that the browser must, regardless
           of application behavior, reduce send rate when
           there is congestion).
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   F4      The browser must be able to receive, process and
           render streams and data ("render" does not
           apply for data) from peers.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   F5      The browser should be able to render good quality
           audio and video even in the presence of
           reasonable levels of jitter and packet losses.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   F7      The browser must support insertion of reference frames
           in outgoing media streams when requested by a peer.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   F8      The browser must detect when a stream from a
           peer is not received anymore
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   F9      When there are both incoming and outgoing audio
           streams, echo cancellation must be made
           available to avoid disturbing echo during
           conversation.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   F20     It must be possible to protect streams and data
           from wiretapping [RFC2804].

   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   F25     The browser should use encoding of streams
           suitable for the current rendering (e.g.
           video display size) and should change parameters
           if the rendering changes during the session

           and TURN servers
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   F32     There browser must support that STUN and TURN
           servers to use are supplied by other entities
           than via the web application (i.e. the network
           provider).
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   F33     The browser must be able to send reliable
           data traffic to a peer browser.

           and data packets that fail the per-packet
           integrity check.  In addition, the browser
           must support a mechanism for cryptographically
           binding media and data security keys to the

5.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA actions in this document.

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Introduction

   A malicious web application might use the browser to perform Denial
   Of Service (DOS) attacks on NAT infrastructure, or on peer devices.
   Also, a malicious web application might silently establish outgoing,
   and accept incoming, streams on an already established connection.

   Based on the identified security risks, this section will describe
   security considerations for the browser and web application.

6.2.  Browser Considerations

   The browser is expected to provide mechanisms for getting user
   consent to use device resources such as camera and microphone.

   The browser is expected to provide mechanisms for informing the user
   that device resources such as camera and microphone are in use
   ("hot").

   The browser is expected to provide mechanisms for users to revise and
   even completely revoke consent to use device resources such as camera
   and microphone.

   The browser is expected to provide mechanisms for getting user
   consent to use the screen (or a certain part of it) or what a certain
   application displays on the screen as source for streams.

   The browser is expected to provide mechanisms for informing the user
   that the screen, part thereof or an application is serving as a
   stream source ("hot").

   The browser is expected to provide mechanisms for users to revise and
   even completely revoke consent to use the screen, part thereof or an
   application is serving as a stream source.

   The browser is expected to provide mechanisms in order to assure that
   streams are the ones the recipient intended to receive.

   The browser is expected to provide mechanisms that allows the users
   to verify that the streams received have not be manipulated (F35).

   The browser needs to ensure that media is not sent, and that received
   media is not rendered, until the associated stream establishment and
   handshake procedures with the remote peer have been successfully
   finished.

   The browser needs to ensure that the stream negotiation procedures
   are not seen as Denial Of Service (DOS) by other entities.

6.3.  Web Application Considerations

   The web application is expected to ensure user consent in sending and
   receiving media streams.

7.  Additional use-cases

   Several additional use-cases have been discussed.  At this point
   these use-cases are not included as requirement deriving use-cases
   for different reasons (lack of documentation, overlap with existing
   use-cases, lack of consensus).  For completeness these additional
   use-cases are listed below:

   1.   Use-cases regarding different situations when being invited to a
        "session", e.g. browser open, browser open but another tab
        active, browser open but active in session, browser closed, ....

9.  Change Log

   [RFC EDITOR NOTE: Please remove this section when publishing]

   Changes from draft-ietf-rtcweb-use-cases-and-requirements-10

   o  Described that the API requirements are really from a W3C
      perspective and are supplied as an appendix in the introduction.
      Moved API requirements to an Appendix.

   o  Removed the "Conventions" section with the key-words and reference
      to RFC2119.  Also changed uppercase MUST's/SHOULD's to lowercase.

   o  Added a note on the proposed use of the document to the
      introduction.

   o  Removed the note talking about WS from the "FW that only allows
      http" use-case.

   o  Removed the word "Skype" that was used as example in one of the
      use-cases.

   o  Clarified F3 (the req saying the everything the browser sends must
      be rate controlled).

   o  Removed the TBD saying we need to define reasonable levels from
      the requirement saying that quality must be good even in presence
      of packet losses (F5), and changed "must" to "should" (Based on a
      list discussion involving Bernard).

   o  Removed F6 ("The browser must be able to handle high loss and
      jitter levels in a graceful way."), also after a list discussion.

   o  Clarified F7 (used to say that the browser must support fast
      stream switches, now says that reference frames must be inserted
      when requested).

   o  Removed the questions from F9 (echo cancellation), F10
      (synchronization), F21 (telephony codec).

   o  Exchanged "restrictive firewalls" for "limited middleboxes" in F19
      (as proposed by Martin).

   o  Expanded DTMF and IVR in F22 (proposed by Martin)

   o  Added ref to RFC5405 in F23 (proposed by Lars Eggert).

   o  Exchanged "service provided" for "web application" in F32.

   o  Changed the text in 3.2.1 that motivates F36 (new text "It is
      essential that media and data be encrypted, authenticated ...
      bound to the user identity."); and rewrote F36, included a ref to
      RFC5479.

   o  Changed "quality of service" to "quality of experience" in F38.

   o  Added F39.

   o  Used new formulation of A17 (proposed by Martin).

   o  Updated A20.

   o  Updated A25.

   Changes from draft-ietf-rtcweb-use-cases-and-requirements-09

   o  Changed "video communication session" to "audiovisual
      communication session.

   Changes from draft-ietf-rtcweb-use-cases-and-requirements-08

   o  Changed "eavesdropping" to "wiretapping" and referenced RFC2804.

   o  Removed informal ref webrtc_req; that document has been abandoned
      by the W3C webrtc WG.

   o  Added use-case where one user is behind a FW that only allows
      http; derived req.  F37.

   o  Changed F24 slightly; MUST-> SHOULD, inserted "available".

   o  Added a clause to "Simple video communication service" saying that
      the service provider monitors the quality of service, and derived
      reqs F38 and A26.

   Changes from draft-ietf-rtcweb-use-cases-and-requirements-07

   o  Added "and data exchange" to 1.  Introduction.

   o  Removed cone and symmetric NAT from 4.1 Introduction, refers to
      RFC4787 instead.

   o  Added text on enabling verification of that the media has not been
      manipulated by anyone to use-case "Simple Video Communication
      Service", derived req.  F35

      A22)

   Changes from draft-ietf-rtcweb-use-cases-and-requirements-05

   o  Added use-case "global service provider", derived reqs associated
      with several STUN/TURN servers

      accordingly

   o  Separated the requirements phrased like "processing such as pan,
      mix and render" for audio to be specific reqs on spatialization,
      level measurement, level adjustment and mixing (discussed on the
      lists in http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/rtcweb/current/
      msg01648.html and http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-
      webrtc/2011Sep/0102.html)

   o  Added use-case on sharing as decided in http://www.ietf.org/mail-
      archive/web/rtcweb/current/msg01700.html, derived reqs F30 and A21

           application to ask the browser for permission
           to use cameras and microphones as input devices.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A2      The Web API must provide means for the web
           application to control how streams generated
           by input devices are used.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A3      The Web API must provide means for the web
           application to control the local rendering of
           streams (locally generated streams and streams
           received from a peer).
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A4      The Web API must provide means for the web
           application to initiate sending of
           stream/stream components to a peer.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A5      The Web API must provide means for the web
           application to control the media format (codec)
           to be used for the streams sent to a peer.

           NOTE: The level of control depends on whether
           the codec negotiation is handled by the browser
           or the web application.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A6      The Web API must provide means for the web
           application to modify the media format for
           streams sent to a peer after a media stream
           has been established.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A7      The Web API must provide means for
           informing the web application of whether the
           establishment of a stream with a peer was
           successful or not.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A8      The Web API must provide means for the web
           application to mute/unmute a stream or stream
           component(s). When a stream is sent to a peer
           mute status must be preserved in the stream
           received by the peer.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A9      The Web API must provide means for the web
           application to cease the sending of a stream
           to a peer.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A10     The Web API must provide means for the web
           application to cease processing and rendering
           of a stream received from a peer.

   A11         The Web API must provide means for
           informing the web application when a
           stream from a peer is no longer received.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A12         The Web API must provide means for

           application to detect the level in audio
           streams.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A15     The Web API must provide means for the web
           application to adjust the level in audio
           streams.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A16     The Web API must provide means for the web
           application to mix audio streams.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A17     The Web API must provide a way to identify
           streams such that an application is able to
           match streams on a sending peer with the same
           stream on all receiving peers.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A18     The Web API must provide a mechanism for sending
           and receiving isolated discrete chunks of data.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A19     The Web API must provide means for the web
           application to indicate the type of audio signal
           (speech, audio) for audio stream(s)/stream
           component(s).
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A20     It must be possible for an initiator or a
           responder web application to indicate the types
           of media it is willing to accept incoming
           streams for when setting up a connection (audio,
           video, other). The types of media to be accepted
           can be a subset of the types of media the browser
           is able to accept.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   A21     The Web API must provide means for the
           application to ask the browser for permission
