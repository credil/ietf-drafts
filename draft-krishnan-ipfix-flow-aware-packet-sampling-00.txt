Abstract

   The demands on the networking infrastructure and thus the
   switch/router bandwidths are growing exponentially; the drivers are
   bandwidth hungry rich media applications, inter data center
   communications etc. Using sampling techniques, for a given sampling
   rate, the amount of samples that need to be processed is increasing
   exponentially. This draft suggests flow aware sampling techniques for
   handling various scenarios with minimal sampling overhead.

1. Introduction

   Packet sampling techniques in switches and routers provide an
   effective mechanism for approximate detection of various types of
   flows (long-lived and short-lived) with minimal packet replication
   bandwidth overhead. A large percentage of the packet samples comprise
   of long-lived large flows and a small percentage of the packet
   samples comprise of other flows. The long-lived large flows aka top-
   talkers consume a large percentage of the bandwidth and small
   percentage of the flow space. The other flows, which are the typical
   cause of security threats like Denial of Service (DOS) attacks,
   Scanning attacks etc., consume a small percentage of the bandwidth
   and a large percentage of the flow space. This draft explores light-
   weight techniques for automatically detecting the top-talkers in
   real-time with a high degree of accuracy and sampling only the other
   flows - this makes security threat detection more effective with
   minimal sampling overhead.

1.1. Conventions used

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The following acronyms are used:


   DOS: Denial of Service

   MPLS: Multi Protocol Label Switching

   NVGRE: Network Virtualization using Generic Routing Encapsulation

   TCAM: Ternary Content Addressable Memory

   VXLAN: Virtual Extensible LAN

2. Flow Aware Packet Sampling

   The steps in flow aware packet sampling are described below

   1) Any flow which exceeds minimum flow duration and a minimum
     bandwidth would be characterized as a long-lived large flow. For
     identifying long-lived large flows, use the techniques described
     in Section 2.1. This helps in identifying the long-lived large
     flows aka top-talkers in real-time with a high degree of accuracy.

   2) The identified long-lived large flows can be broadly classified
     into 2 categories as detailed below; these flows can be sampled at
     a low rate or need not be sampled.

        a.  Well behaved (steady rate) long-lived large flows, e.g.
          video streams

        b.  Bursty (fluctuating rate) long-lived large flows e.g. Peer-
          to-Peer traffic

   3) The other flows (excluding the long-lived large flows) can be
     sampled at a normal rate. The other flows can be examined for
     determining security threats like DOS attacks, Scanning attacks
     etc. [LANCOPE]

   For packet sampling, it is recommended to use PSAMP [RFCs 5474-5477]
   or sFlow [RFC 3176].

 2.1. Long-lived Large Flow Identification

   A flow (long-lived large/small flow or short-lived large/small flow)
   can be defined using one or more of the following suggested formats
   as described below

     .  IP 5 tuple: IP Protocol, IP source address, IP destination
        address, TCP/UDP source port, TCP/UDP destination port

     .  IP 3 tuple: IP Protocol,  IP source address, IP destination
        address

     .  MPLS Labels

     .  VXLAN, NVGRE

     .  IP source address, IP destination address and IPv6 flow label
        (RFC 6437)

     .  Other formats

   The techniques described in this document are agnostic to the format
   of the flow.

2.1.1. Automatic identification

   Automatic identification of long-lived large flows can be implemented
   in ingress and/or egress processing elements of switches and routers.
   The characteristics of such an implementation would be

     .  Inline solution

     .  Minimal system resources

     .  Maintain line-rate performance

     .  Perform accounting of long-lived large flows with a high degree
        of accuracy

   The advantages and disadvantages of automatic identification are
   detailed below.

   Advantages of Automatic Identification

     .  Accurate identification of long-lived large flows

     .  Real-time identification of long-lived large flows

   Disadvantages of Automatic Identification

     .  Not supported in many switches and routers

   The implementation of automatic identification of long-lived large
   flows is vendor dependent. Below is a suggested technique.

   Note: Netflow learns all the flows (long-lived and short-lived) and
   has scalability issues in terms of flow-cache size and CPU
   utilization.

2.1.1.1. Programmable parameters in Switches and Routers for
     Automatic Identification

     .  Minimum measurement interval for determining a candidate long-
        lived large flow (for e.g. 60 seconds)

     .  Minimum bandwidth of long-lived large flow (for e.g. 100 Mbps)

     .  Policy specification (for e.g. flows from a given IP source
        and/or destination address)

2.1.1.2. Suggested Technique for Automatic Identification

   Step 1) If the long-lived large flow exists in a flow-table (e.g.
   TCAM), increment a per flow counter. Else, proceed to Step 2.

   Step 2) There are multiple hash tables, each with a different hash
   function. Each hash table entry has an associated counter. On packet
   arrival, a new flow is looked up in parallel in all the hash tables
   and the corresponding counter is incremented. If the counter exceeds
   a programmed threshold in a given time interval in all the hash table
   entries, a candidate long-lived-flow is learnt and programmed in a
   flow-table.

   There may be some false positives due to multiple other flows
   masquerading as a long-lived large flow; the amount of false
   positives is reduced by parallel hashing using different hash
   functions.

   This technique is also suggested in [draft-krishnan-opsawg-large-flow-
   load-balancing].

4. IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

5. Security Considerations

   This document does not directly impact the security of the Internet
   infrastructure or its applications. In fact, it proposes techniques
   which could help in identifying a DOS attack pattern.

6. Data Model Considerations

   In Section 2, for exporting the identified long-lived large flows to
   an external entity, it is recommended to use one of the protocols
   recommended in evaluation of candidate protocols for IPFIX [RFC
   3955]. For any packet formats (for e.g. VXLAN, NVGRE) which are not
   covered by the above RFCs, a flow export data model needs to be
   defined - IETF could potentially consider a standards-based activity
   around this.

   Section 2.1.1.1 defines programmable parameters in switches and
   routers for automatic identification. IETF could potentially consider
   a standards-based activity around defining a data model for moving
   this information from a central management entity to the
   switch/router.
