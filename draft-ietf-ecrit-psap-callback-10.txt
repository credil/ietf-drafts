             Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) Callback
                 draft-ietf-ecrit-psap-callback-10.txt

Abstract

   After an emergency call is completed (either prematurely terminated
   by the emergency caller or normally by the call taker) it is possible
   that the call taker feels the need for further communication.  For
   example, the call may have been dropped by accident without the call
   taker having sufficient information about the current situation of a
   wounded person.  A call taker may trigger a callback towards the
   emergency caller using the contact information provided with the
   initial emergency call.  This callback could, under certain
   circumstances, be treated like any other call and as a consequence it
   may get blocked by authorization policies or may get forwarded to an
   answering machine.

   The IETF emergency services architecture specification already offers
   a solution approach for allowing PSAP callbacks to bypass
   authorization policies to reach the caller without unnecessary
   delays.  Unfortunately, the specified mechanism only supports limited
   scenarios.  This document discusses shortcomings of the current
   mechanisms and illustrates additional scenarios where better-than-
   normal call treatment behavior would be desirable.  A solution based
   on a new header field value, called "psap-callback", for the SIP
   Priority header field is specified to accomplish the PSAP callback
   marking.

1.  Introduction

   Summoning police, the fire department or an ambulance in emergencies
   is one of the fundamental and most-valued functions of the telephone.
   As telephone functionality moves from circuit-switched telephony to
   Internet telephony, its users rightfully expect that this core
   functionality will continue to work at least as well as it has for
   the legacy technology.  New devices and services are being made
   available that could be used to make a request for help, which are
   not traditional telephones, and users are increasingly expecting them
   to be used to place emergency calls.

   An overview of the protocol interactions for emergency calling using
   the IETF emergency services architecture are described in [RFC6443]
   and [RFC6881] specifies the technical details.  As part of the
   emergency call setup procedure two important identifiers are conveyed
   to the PSAP call taker's user agent, namely the Address-Of-Record
   (AOR), and, if available, the Globally Routable User Agent (UA) URIs
   (GRUU).  RFC 3261 [RFC3261] defines the AOR as:

      "An address-of-record (AOR) is a SIP or SIPS URI that points to a
      domain with a location service that can map the URI to another URI
      where the user might be available.  Typically, the location
      service is populated through registrations.  An AOR is frequently
      thought of as the "public address" of the user."

   In SIP systems a single user can have a number of user agents
   (handsets, softphones, voicemail accounts, etc.) which are all
   referenced by the same AOR.  There are a number of cases in which it
   is desirable to have an identifier which addresses a single user
   agent rather than the group of user agents indicated by an AOR.  The
   GRUU is such a unique user-agent identifier, which is still globally
   routable.  RFC 5627 [RFC5627] specifies how to obtain and use GRUUs.
   [RFC6881] also makes use of the GRUU for emergency calls.

   Regulatory requirements demand that the emergency call setup
   procedure itself provides enough information to allow the call taker
   to initiate a callback to the emergency caller.  This is desirable in
   those cases where the call got dropped prematurely or when further
   communication need arises.  The AOR and the GRUU serve this purpose.

   The communication attempt by the PSAP call taker back to the
   emergency caller is called 'PSAP callback'.

   A PSAP callback may, however, be blocked by user configured
   authorization policies or may be forwarded to an answering machine
   since SIP entities (SIP proxies as well as the SIP user equipment
   itself) cannot differentiate the PSAP callback from any other SIP

   call.  "Call barring", "do not disturb", or "call diversion"(aka call
   forwarding) are features that prevent delivery of a call.  It is
   important to note that these features may be implemented by SIP
   intermediaries as well as by the user agent.

   Among the emergency services community there is the desire to offer
   PSAP callbacks a treatment such that chances are increased that it
   reaches the emergency caller.  At the same time a design must deal
   with the negative side-effects of allowing certain calls to bypass
   call forwarding or other authorization policies.  Ideally, the PSAP
   callback has to relate to an earlier emergency call that was made
   "not too long ago".  An exact time interval is difficult to define in
   a global IETF standard due to the variety of national regulatory
   requirements.

   To nevertheless meet the needs from the emergency services community
   a basic mechanism for preferential treatment of PSAP callbacks was
   defined in Section 13 of [RFC6443].  The specification says:

      "A UA may be able to determine a PSAP callback by examining the
      domain of incoming calls after placing an emergency call and
      comparing that to the domain of the answering PSAP from the
      emergency call.  Any call from the same domain and directed to the
      supplied Contact header or AOR after an emergency call should be
      accepted as a callback from the PSAP if it occurs within a
      reasonable time after an emergency call was placed."

   This approach mimics a stateful packet filtering firewall and is
   indeed helpful in a number of cases.  It is also relatively simple to
   implement even though it requires call state to be maintained by the
   user agent as well as by SIP intermediaries.  Unfortunately, the
   solution does not work in all deployment scenarios.  In Section 3 we
   describe cases where the currently standardized approach is
   insufficient.

2.  Terminology

   Emergency services related terminology is borrowed from [RFC5012].
   This includes terminology like emergency caller, user equipment, call
   taker, Emergency Service Routing Proxy (ESRP), and Public Safety
   Answering Point (PSAP).

3.  Callback Scenarios

   This section illustrates a number of scenarios where the currently
   specified solution, as specified in [RFC6881], for preferential
   treatment of callbacks fails.  As explained in Section 1 a SIP entity
   examines an incoming PSAP callback by comparing the domain of the
   PSAP with the destination domain of the emergency call.

   NOTE: All FQDNs used in the subsections below are used for
   illustrative purposes.  They are examples to demonstrate the
   limitations of the technical solution outlined in RFC 6881.

3.1.  Routing Asymmetry

   In some deployment environments it is common to have incoming and
   outgoing SIP messaging routed through different SIP entities.  Figure
   1 shows this graphically whereby a VoIP provider uses different SIP
   proxies for inbound and for outbound call handling.  Unless the two
   devices are synchronized as to state the callback hitting the inbound
   proxy would get treated like any other call since the emergency call
   established state information at the outbound proxy only.

3.2.  Multi-Stage Routing

   Consider the following emergency call routing scenario shown in
   Figure 2 where routing towards the PSAP occurs in several stages.  In
   this scenario we consider a SIP UA that uses LoST to learn the next
   hop destination closer to the PSAP.  This call is then sent to the
   user's VoIP provider.  The user's VoIP provider receives the
   emergency call and creates state based on the destination domain,
   namely state.org.  It then routes it to the indicated ESRP.  When the
   ESRP receives it it needs to decide what the next hop is to get it
   closer to the PSAP.  In our example the next hop is the PSAP with the
   URI psap@town.com.

   When a callback is sent from psap@town.com towards the emergency
   caller the call will get normal treatment by the VoIP providers
   inbound proxy since the domain of the PSAP does not match the stored
   state information.

3.3.  Call Forwarding

   Imagine the following case where an emergency call enters an
   emergency network (state.org) via an ESRP but then gets forwarded to
   a different emergency services network (in our example to police-
   town.org, fire-town.org or medic-town.org).  The same considerations
   apply when the police, fire and ambulance networks are part of the
   state.org sub-domains (e.g., police.state.org).

   Similarly to the previous scenario the problem here is with the wrong
   state information being established during the emergency call setup
   procedure.  A callback would originate in the police-town.org, fire-
   town.org or medic-town.org domain whereas the emergency caller's SIP
   UA or the VoIP outbound proxy has stored state.org.

3.4.  Network-based Service URN Resolution

   The IETF emergency services architecture also considers cases where
   the resolution from the Service URN to the PSAP URI does not only
   happen at the SIP UA itself but at intermediate SIP entities, such as
   the user's VoIP provider.

3.5.  PSTN Interworking

   In case an emergency call enters the PSTN, as shown in Figure 5,
   there is no guarantee that the callback some time later does leave
   the same PSTN/VoIP gateway or that the same end point identifier is
   used in the forward as well as in the backward direction making it
   difficult to reliably detect PSAP callbacks.

4.  SIP PSAP Callback Indicator

4.1.  General

   This section defines a new header field value, called "psap-
   callback", for the SIP Priority header field defined in [RFC3261].
   The value is used to inform SIP entities that the request is
   associated with a PSAP callback SIP session.

4.2.  Usage

   SIP entities that receive the header field value within an initial
   request for a SIP session can, depending on local policies, apply
   PSAP callback specific procedures for the session or request.

Internet-Draft                PSAP Callback                    July 2013


   The PSAP callback specific procedures may be applied by SIP-based
   network entities and by the callee.  The specific procedures taken
   when receiving such a PSAP callback marked call, such as bypassing
   services and barring procedures, are outside the scope of this
   document.

4.3.  Syntax

4.3.1.  General

   This section defines the ABNF for the new SIP Priority header field
   value "psap-callback".

4.3.2.  ABNF

    priority-value  /=  "psap-callback"

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Security Threat

   The PSAP callback functionality described in this document allows
   marked calls to bypass blacklists, ignore call forwarding procedures
   and other similar features used to raise the attention of emergency
   callers when attempting to contact them.  In the case where the SIP
   Priority header value, 'psap-callback', is supported by the SIP UA,
   it would override user interface configurations, such as vibrate-only
   mode, to alert the caller of the incoming call.

5.2.  Security Requirements

   The requirement is to ensure that the mechanisms described in this
   document can not be used for malicious purposes, including
   telemarketing.

   Furthermore, if the newly defined extension is not recognized, not
   verified adequately, or not obeyed by SIP intermediaries or SIP
   endpoints then it must not lead to a failure of the call handling
   procedure.  Such call must be treated like a call that does not have
   any marking attached.

5.3.  Security Solution

   Figure 7 shows the architecture that utilizes the identity of the
   PSAP to decide whether a preferential treatment of callbacks should
   be provided.  To make this policy decision, the identity of the PSAP
   is compared with a white list of valid PSAPs available to the SIP
   entity.  The identity assurance in SIP can come in different forms,
   such as SIP Identity [RFC4474] or with P-Asserted-Identity [RFC3325].
   The former technique relies on a cryptographic assurance and the
   latter on a chain of trust.  Also the usage of TLS between
   neighboring SIP entities may provide useful identity information.

                  Figure 7: Identity-based Authorization

   An important aspect from a security point of view is the relationship
   between the emergency services network (containing PSAPs) and the
   VoIP provider (assuming that the emergency call travels via the VoIP
   provider and not directly between the SIP UA and the PSAP).

   If there is some form of relationship between the emergency services
   operator and the VoIP provider then the identification of a PSAP
   callback is less problematic than in the case where the two entities
   have not entered in some form of relationship that would allow the
   VoIP provider to verify whether the marked callback message indeed
   came from a legitimate source.

   The establishment of a whitelist with PSAP identities maybe be
   operationally complex.  When there is a local relationship between
   the VoIP provider and the PSAP then populating the whitelist is
   fairly simple.  For SIP UAs there is no need to maintain a list of
   PSAPs.  Instead SIP UAs are assumed to trust the correct processing
   of their VoIP provider, i.e., the VoIP provider processes the PSAP
   callback marking and, if it cannot be verified, the PSAP callback
   marking is removed.  If it is left untouched then the SIP UA should
   assume that it has been verified successfully by the VoIP provider
   and it should therefore be obeyed.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds the "psap-callback" value to the SIP Priority
   header IANA registry allocated by [RFC6878].  The semantic of the
   newly defined "psap-callback" value is defined in Section 4.
