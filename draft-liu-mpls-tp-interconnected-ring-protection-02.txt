              MPLS-TP protection for interconnected rings
          draft-liu-mpls-tp-interconnected-ring-protection-02

Abstract

   According to the ring protection Requirements in RFC 5654,
   Requirement 93 : When a network is constructed from interconnected
   rings, MPLS-TP MUST support recovery mechanisms that protect user
   data that traverses more than one ring.  This includes the
   possibility of failure of the ring-interconnect nodes and links,so
   this document will describle all kinds of interconnected ring
   Scenarios and several protection solutions for recovery the failure
   of the ring-interconnect nodes and Links. .


   This document is a product of a joint Internet Task Force(IETF) /
   International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as
   defined by the ITU-T.

1.  Introduction

   This document describles different interconnected ring scenarios and
   several protection solutions to protect against the failure of the
   ring-interconnect nodes and links. there are mainly three common
   interconnection scenarios that we will address in this document:

   Dual-node interconnection - when the interconnected rings are
   interconnected by two nodes from each ring (see Figure 1);

   Single-node interconnection - when the connection between the
   interconnected rings are through a single node (see Figure 2).As the
   interconnnection node(LSR-A) is a single-point of failure, such the
   interconnection scenario should be avoided in real network;

   Chain of rings - when a series of rings are connected through
   interconnection nodes that are part of both interconnected rings (see
   Figure 3)

   Regarding traffic that traveres more than two rings.the different
   interconnection scenarios could be mixed.

   Dual-node and single-node mixed interconnection-when there not only
   exist two interconnected rings are interconnected by two nodes from
   each ring. but also there exist two interconnected rings are
   interconnected by single node( see figure 5);

   Dual-node and chained mixed interconnection-when there exist two
   interconnnected rings are interconnected by two nodes from each ring.
   in addtion, there still exist two interconnnected rings are
   interconnected by a common chained link(see figure 4);

   single-node and chained mixed interconnection-when there exist two
   interconnected rings are interconnected by single node, in addtion,
   there still exist two interconnected rings are interconnected by a
   common chained link(see figure 6);

   Dual-node, single-node and chained mixed interconnection-when there
   exist all three interconnection scenrios in the network domain
   including Dual-node interconnnection, single-node interconnection and
   chained interconnnection( see figure 7);

   For a multi-ring service, it will be accross more than one ring just
   like above seven scenrios. if a failur happens on a multi-ring path,
   quickly recovery is necessary requirement for MPLS-TP network, so
   there are describles for recoverying the failure in the multi-ring
   interconnection sencrios in the following sections .

3.  recovery mechanisms

   This following sections propose different mechanisms that may be used
   to protect traffic that traverses multiple rings in the different
   interconnection scenarios.

3.1.  recovery mechanism for Dual-node interconnected-ring

   Under the interconnected-ring scenrio just as figure 1,multi-ring
   traffic will be transported by interconnection link(LSR C-LSR
   6).protecting against a failure on the interconnection link could be
   based on 1:1 linear protection of the segment from LSR-A to LSR-6 by
   using the protection path LSR-A to LSR-F to LSR-6.  Alternatively, an
   end-to-end protection path(LSR-C to LSR-2 through D-E-F-5-4-3) could
   be used to protect all traffic.  For the two alternatives, they both
   have different advantage and disadvantage. 1:1 linear segment
   protection may be faster than end-to-end protection. but when the
   interconnection node(LSR-A or LSR-6) has a failure, it maybe need
   another protection solution to recovery it. but end-to-end protection
   may protect one or multiple failures on multi-ring working path.in
   specially, it may protect the failure of interconnection node. .

3.2.  recovery mechanism for Chained interconnected-ring

   For the chained interconnected-ring scenrio, if the interconnection
   nodes(LSR-A and LSR-F) or the shared link(LSR-A-LSR-F) have failures,
   protecting each single ring will fail to provide recovery of the
   failure, so the affected multi-ring traffic should be protected by an
   end-to-end protection path. .

3.3.  recovery mechanism for Dual-node and Single-node mixed
      interconnected-ring

   For the mixed interconnected-ring scenrio, As the single-node
   interconnection scenario should be avoided. if we only consider
   segment protection between two rings, the solution is the same as
   dual-node interconnected-ring. .

3.4.  recovery mechanism for Dual-node and Chained mixed interconnected-
      ring

   . for the mixed interconnected-ring scenrio, each interconnection
   nodes or shared interconnection link will be protected by setting up
   segment protection path seperately. in addition, it may still use end
   to end multi-ring protection path to protect multiple interconnection
   nodes or shared interconnection link failure.

3.5.  recovery mechanism for Single-node and Chained mixed
      interconnected-ring

   for the mixed interconnected-ring scenrios, As the single-node
   interconnection scenario should be avoided. if we only consider
   segment protection between two rings, the solution is the same as
   chained interconnected-ring.

3.6.  recovery mechanism for Dual-node ,Single-node and Chained mixed
      interconnected-ring

   for the mixed interconnected-ring scenrios, As the single-node
   interconnection scenario should be avoided. here we can consider the
   protection solution maybe like solution of dual-node and chained
   mixed interconnected-ring scenario.
