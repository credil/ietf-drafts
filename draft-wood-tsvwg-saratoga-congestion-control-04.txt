              Congestion control for the Saratoga protocol
            draft-wood-tsvwg-saratoga-congestion-control-04

Abstract

   Saratoga is a data transfer protocol designed to carry potentially
   large volumes of data over difficult network paths, often including
   only a single high-rate link and only one application flow.  As the
   requirements for use vary across deployment environments, the base
   Saratoga specification only assumes that an implementation will be
   able to clock packets out at a configurable rate, and beyond this
   specifies no inherent or particular congestion-control behaviour.
   The design of Saratoga deliberately supports the integration of
   congestion-control algorithms without modification to the base
   protocol.  This document describes how congestion control can be
   supported in the Saratoga transfer protocol.  Saratoga is intended
   for use in private networks, where its use is engineered as a single
   flow to fill a link.  However, as Saratoga is implemented over UDP,
   it can be multiplexed, and can be run across the public Internet, in
   which case congestion control in accordance with the UDP Guidelines
   becomes necessary.

Internet-Draft         Saratoga congestion control          October 2013


   The Saratoga data transfer protocol is described in
   [draft-wood-tsvwg-saratoga].  Given that Saratoga was originally
   developed for scheduled peer-to-peer communications over dedicated
   links in private networks, where each application has the entire link
   for the duration of its transfer, many Saratoga implementations
   deliberately lack any form of congestion control and send at line
   rate to maximise throughput and link utilisation in their
   environments.  Congestion control is necessary for use in the public
   Internet, in accordance with the UDP Guidelines [RFC5405].  Newer
   Saratoga implementations may use timestamps to perform TCP-Friendly
   Rate Control (TFRC) [RFC5348] or other congestion control mechanisms
   such as LEDBAT [RFC6817], if appropriate for the environment, and
   where simultaneous sharing of capacity with other traffic and
   applications is required.  Sender-side TFRC for Saratoga has been
   shown to be possible without modifications to the Saratoga protocol
   specification, using existing timestamps on selective negative
   acknowledgement messages [draft-eddy-tsvwg-saratoga-tfrc].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.  [RFC2119]

2.  Approaches to congestion control

   Saratoga can be implemented to perform congestion control at the
   sender, based on feedback from acknowledgement STATUS packets, or
   have the sender configured to use simple open-loop rate control to
   only use a fixed amount of link capacity.  Congestion control is
   expected to be undesirable for many of Saratoga's use cases and
   expected environmental conditions, while simple rate control is
   considered useful for some use cases.  Use over the public Internet
   requires congestion control.

   Congestion control MUST be supported and used if Saratoga is being
   used across paths that go over the public Internet, and SHOULD be
   supported in environments where links in the path are shared by
   traffic flows.  Congestion control MAY NOT be supported across
   private, single-flow links engineered for performance: Saratoga's
   primary use case.

2.1.  TCP-friendly rate control

   Sender-side TCP-friendly rate control can be implemented by mirroring
   timestamps in STATUS messages and using the approach outlined in
   [draft-eddy-tsvwg-saratoga-tfrc].

   Other approaches to TCP-friendly congestion control are possible, and
   Saratoga and its selective negative acknowledgements may prove useful

   as an implementation testbed for developing and refining new
   congestion-control algorithms.

2.2.  Explicit Congestion Notification

   Supporting Explicit Congestion Notification in a UDP-based protocol
   such as Saratoga requires that ECN events be exposed to userspace
   applications using UDP via a programming interface.  Once such a
   programming interface becomes available, providing counts of ECN
   events in STATUS and DATA packets will be straightforward.  Until
   that time, specifying ECN support in more detail is not required.

3.  Security Considerations

   Use of effective congestion control mechanisms always raises concerns
   about fairness and spoofing or misleading senders - issues not unique
   to Saratoga.

4.  IANA Considerations

   There should be no additional IANA considerations.

5.  Acknowledgements

   We thank the IETF for reminding us about the importance of congestion
   for standards-track protocols.
