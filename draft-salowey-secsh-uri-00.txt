    Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Scheme for Secure Shell (SSH)
                     draft-salowey-secsh-uri-00.txt

Abstract

   This document describes the Uniform Resource Identifiers used to
   locate resources for the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol.  The document
   describes the generic syntax involved in URI definitions as well as
   specific definitions for the protocol.  These specific definitions
   include user credentials such as username and other parameters such
   as host key fingerprint.

Internet-Draft             URI Scheme for SSH              November 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to be
   used with the Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC4251] protocos.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  General Syntax

   A hierarchical URI shall consist of the scheme and the scheme
   specific portion separated by a colon ":" followed by the
   hierarchical part, as discussed in [RFC3986].  This specification
   uses the definitions "port", "host", "scheme", "userinfo", "path-
   empty", "path-abempty" and "authority" from [RFC3986].  This document
   follows the ABNF notation defined in [RFC5234].


3.  Secure Shell (SSH) URI

   This section describes the SSH URI and contains the information
   necessary to register the URI according to the template in [RFC4395].

3.1.  Scheme Name

   The Secure Shell scheme name is "ssh".

3.2.  Status

   The requested status of the SSH URI is "permanent".

3.3.  URI Scheme Syntax

   The Secure Shell (SSH) scheme shall consist of the scheme name "ssh"
   followed by a colon ":" followed by hier-part defined in [RFC3986].
   The SSH URI ABNF definition follows.

Internet-Draft             URI Scheme for SSH              November 2010


   sshURI        =  "ssh:" hier-part
   hier-part     =  "//" authority path-abempty
   authority     =  [ [ ssh-info ] "@" ] host [ ":" port ]
   host          =  <as specified in [RFC3986]>
   port          =  <as specified in [RFC3986]>
   path-abempty  =  <as specified in [RFC3986]>
   ssh-info      =  [ userinfo ] [";" c-param *("," c-param)]
   userinfo      =  <as specified in [RFC3986]>
   c-param       =  paramname "=" paramvalue
   paramname     =  *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" )
   paramvalue    =  *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" )

   The following reserved characters from [RFC3986] are used as
   delimiters within the SSH URI: ";", ",", ":", and "=" .  They must
   not be escaped when used as delimiters and must be escaped when the
   appear in other uses.

3.4.  URI Semantics

   The intended usage of the SSH URI is to establish an interactive SSH
   terminal session with the host defined in the authority portion of
   the URI.  The only operation defined for the URI is to establish an
   SSH terminal session with a remote host.

   If the userinfo or connection parameters are present the at-sign "@"
   shall precede the authority section of the URI.  Optionally, the
   authority section MAY also include the port preceded by a colon ":".
   The host SHOULD be a non-empty string.  If the port is not included,
   the default port is assumed.

   The ssh-info portion of the URI MAY include credentials consisting of
   a username followed by optional parameters.  The convention of
   including the password separated from the username by a ":" in the
   URI is NOT RECOMMENDED and is deprecated in accordance with
   [RFC3986].

   One or more optional connection parameters (c-param) may be specified
   within the userinfo section of the URI.  These conn-parameters are
   separated from the userinfo by a semi-colon ";".  The only connection
   parameter defined in this document is for the host-key fingerprint
   described in Section 4.1.  It is possible that additional parameters
   be defined in the future.  If a connection parameter is not
   understood it SHOULD be ignored.

   The SSH URI does not define a usage for a non-empty path element.  If
   a non-empty path element is included in an SSH URI then it SHOULD be
   ignored.

3.5.  Encoding Considerations

   The encoding of the "host" portion of the URI is as defined in
   [RFC3986].  The encoding of the connection parameters is described in
   Section 4.1

3.6.  Protocols using this URI scheme

   This URI scheme is used by the SSH protocol version 2 defined in
   [RFC4251].

3.7.  Security Considerations

   See Section 7.

3.8.  Contact

   This document is discussed on the IETF SSH list: ietf-ssh@netbsd.org


4.  Parameters

4.1.   SSH connection parameters

   The following parameters are associated with an SSH connection and
   are applicable to SSH and SFTP.  All parameters are optional and MUST
   NOT overwrite configured defaults.  Individual parameters are
   separated by a comma (",").

   fingerprint

      The fingerprint parameter contains the fingerprint of the host key
      for the host specified in the URL.  The fingerprint is encoded as
      host-key-alg-fingerprint.  Host-key-alg is host public key
      algorithm defined in [RFC4253] and the fingerprint format is
      [RFC4716].  For use in a URI, the fingerprint shall use a single
      dash "-" as a separator instead of the colon ":" as described in
      [RFC4716].  This parameter MUST NOT overwrite a key that is
      already configured for the host.  The fingerprint MAY be used to
      validate the authenticity of the host key if the URL was obtained
      from an authenticated source with its integrity protected.  If
      this parameter is not included then the host key is validated
      using another method.  See Security Considerations section for
      additional considerations.  There MUST be only one fingerprint
      parameter present in a given URL.

5.  Examples

   The following section shows basic examples of URLs for each protocol.
   This section should not be considered to include all possible
   combinations of URLs for each protocol.

   An SSH connection to the host host.example.com on the standard port
   using username user.

        ssh://user@host.example.com

   An SSH connection to the host host.example.com on port 2222 using
   username user.

        ssh://user@host.example.com:2222

   An SSH connection to the host having the specified host-key
   fingerprint at host.example.com on the standard port using username
   user.

        ssh://user;fingerprint=ssh-dss-c1-b1-30-29-d7-b8-de-6c-97-
             77-10-d7-46-41-63-87@host.example.com


6.  IANA Considerations

   Section 3 provides the information required in the URL registration
   template in accordance with [RFC4395].


7.  Security Considerations

   Passwords SHOULD NOT be included within the URI as doing so poses a
   security risk.  URIs are usually sent in the clear with no encryption
   or other security, any password or other credentials included in the
   userinfo could be seen by a potential attacker.

   Although the host-key fingerprint is not confidential information,
   care must be taken in handling fingerprints associated with URIs
   because URIs transmitted or stored without protection may be modified
   by an attacker.  In general an implementation cannot determine the
   source of a URI so a fingerprint received in a URI should have no
   more trust associated with it than a raw public key received in the
   SSH protocol itself.  If a locally configured key exists for the
   server already it MUST NOT be automatically overwritten with
   information from the URI.  If the host is unknown then the
   implementation should treat the fingerprint received with the same
   caution that it does with any unknown public key.  The client MAY

   offer the fingerprint and URI for external validation before allowing
   a connection based on this information.  If the client chooses to
   make a connection based on the URI information and it finds that the
   fingerprint in the URI and the public key offered by the server do
   not match then it SHOULD provide a warning and provide a means to
   abort the connection.  Sections 4.1 and 9.2.4 of [RFC4251] provide a
   good discussion of handling public keys received in the SSH protocol.
