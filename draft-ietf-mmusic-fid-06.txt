This document defines two Session Description Protocol (SDP)
attributes: "group" and "mid".  They allow to group together several
"m" lines for two different purposes: for lip synchronization and for
receiving media from a single flow (several media streams) that are
encoded in different formats during a particular session, on different
ports and host interfaces.

This document is a product of the Multiparty Multimedia Session
Control Working Group of the IETF.

This is now Proposed Standard Protocol.
