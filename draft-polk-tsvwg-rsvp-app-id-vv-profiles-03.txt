Abstract

   RFC 2872 defines an Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) object for 
   application identifiers.  This document uses that App-ID and gives 
   implementers specific guidelines for differing voice and video 
   stream identifications to nodes along a reservation path, creating 
   specific profiles for voice and video session identification.

1.  Introduction  

   RFC 2872 [RFC2872] describes the usage of policy elements for 
   providing application information in Resource Reservation Protocol 
   (RSVP) signaling [RFC2205]. The intention of providing this 
   information is to enable application-based policy control. However, 
   RFC 2872 does not enumerate any application profiles. The absence 
   of explicit, uniform profiles leads to incompatible handling of 
   these values and also to interoperability problems. An application 
   profile defined by a sender may not be understood by the

   intermediaries or receiver in the same or different domain. 
   Therefore, there is a need to enumerate application profiles that 
   are universally understood and applied for correct policy control. 

   Call control between endpoints has the ability to bind or associate 
   many attributes to a reservation. One new attribute currently being 
   defined is to establish the type of traffic contained that 
   reservation. This is accomplished via assigning a traffic label to 
   the call (or session or flow) [ID-TRAF-CLASS].

   This document takes the application traffic classes from 
   [ID-TRAF-CLASS] and places those strings in the APP-ID object 
   defined in RFC 2872.  Thus, the intermediary devices (e.g., routers)
   processing the RSVP message can learn the identified profile within 
   the Application-ID policy element for a particular reservation, and 
   possibly be configured with the profile(s) to understand them 
   correctly, thus performing the correct admission control.

   Another goal of this document is to the ability to signal an 
   application profile which can then be translated into a DSCP value 
   as per the choice of each domain. While the DCLASS object [RFC2996] 
   allows the transfer of DSCP value in an RSVP message, it does not 
   allow the flexibility of having different domains choosing the DSCP 
   value for the traffic classes that that they maintain.  

   How these labels indicate the appropriate Differentiated Services 
   Codepoint (DSCP) is out of scope for this document. 

   This document will break out each application type and propose how 
   the values in application-id template should be populated for 
   uniformity and interoperability.



2.  Application ID Template

   The template from RFC 2872 is as follows:

            0              1               2               3
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |    PE Length (8)              |   P-type = AUTH_APP           |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |    Attribute Length           |   A-type =    |  Sub-type =   |
   |                               | POLICY_LOCATOR|   ASCII_DN    |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                 Application name as ASCII string              |
   |                         (e.g. SAP.EXE)                        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   In line with how this policy element is constructed in RFC 2872, the
   A-type will remain "POLICY_LOCATOR".

Internet-Draft            RSVP APP-ID Profiles                 Mar 2012


   The P-type field is first created in [RFC2752]. This document 
   creates the new P-type "APP_TC" for application traffic class, which 
   is more appropriately named for the purpose described in this 
   extension. 

   The first Sub-type will be mandatory for every profile within this 
   document, and will be "ASCII_DN".  No other Sub-types are defined by
   any profile within this document, but can be included by individual 
   implementations - and MUST be ignored if not understood by receiving
   implementations.

   RFC 2872 states the #1 sub-element from RFC 2872 as the "identifier 
   that uniquely identifies the application vendor", which is optional 
   to include.  This document modifies this vendor limitation so that 
   the identifier need only be unique - and not limited to an 
   application vendor (identifier). For example, this specification now
   allows an RFC that defines a well known word or string to be a valid
   identifier. This sub-element is still optional to include.

   The following subsections will define the values within the above 
   template into specific profiles for voice and video identification.


3.  The Voice and Video Application-ID Profiles

   This section contains the elements of the Application ID policy 
   object which is used to signal the application classes defined in 
   [ID-TRAF-CLASS]. 

3.1 The Broadcast Profiles

   Broadcast profiles are for minimally buffered one-way streaming 
   flows, such as video surveillance, or Internet based concerts or 
   non-VOD TV broadcasts such as live sporting events.

   There will be Broadcast profiles for 

   - Broadcast IPTV for audio and video
   - Broadcast Live-events for audio and video
   - Broadcast Video-Surveillance for video

   Here is an example profile for identifying Broadcast 
   Video-Surveillance

      APP_TC, POLICY_LOCATOR, ASCII_DN, 
     "GUID=http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/
                  draft-ietf-mmusic-traffic-class-for-sdp-01.txt,
      APP=broadcast.video-surveillance, VER="

   Where the Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) indicates the documented 
   reference that created this well known string [ID-TRAF-CLASS], the

Internet-Draft            RSVP APP-ID Profiles                 Mar 2012

   APP is the profile name with no spaces, and the "VER=" is included, 
   but has no value at this time.


3.2 The Realtime Interactive Profiles

   Realtime Interactive profiles are for on-line gaming, and both 
   remote and virtual avconf applications.

   There will be Realtime Interactive profiles for 

   - Realtime-Interactive Gaming
   - Realtime-Interactive Remote-Desktop
   - Realtime-Interactive Virtualized-Desktop

   Here is the profile for identifying Realtime-Interactive Gaming 

      APP_TC, POLICY_LOCATOR, ASCII_DN, 
     "GUID=http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/
                  draft-ietf-mmusic-traffic-class-for-sdp-01.txt,
      APP=realtime-interactive.gaming, VER="

   Where the Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) indicates the documented 
   reference that created this well known string [ID-TRAF-CLASS], the 
   APP is the profile name with no spaces, and the "VER=" is included, 
   but has no value, but MAY if versioning becomes important.


3.3 The Multimedia Conferencing Profiles

   There will be Multimedia Conferencing profiles for presentation 
   data, application sharing and whiteboarding.

   - Multimedia-Conferencing presentation-data
   - Multimedia-Conferencing application-sharing
   - Multimedia-Conferencing whiteboarding

   Here is the profile for identifying Multimedia-Conferencing 
   Application-sharing

      APP_TC, POLICY_LOCATOR, ASCII_DN, 
     "GUID=http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/
                  draft-ietf-mmusic-traffic-class-for-sdp-01.txt,
      APP=multimedia-conferencing.application-sharing, VER="

   Where the Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) indicates the RFC 
   reference that created this well known string [ID-TRAF-CLASS], the 
   APP is the profile name with no spaces, and the "VER=" is included, 
   but has no value, but MAY if versioning becomes important.

3.4 The Multimedia Streaming Profiles

   Multimedia Streaming profiles are for more significantly buffered 
   one-way streaming flows than Broadcast profiles. These include...

   There will be Multimedia Streaming profiles for 

   - Multimedia-Streaming multiplex
   - Multimedia-Streaming webcast

   Here is the profile for identifying Multimedia Streaming 
   webcast

      APP_TC, POLICY_LOCATOR, ASCII_DN, 
     "GUID=http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/
                  draft-ietf-mmusic-traffic-class-for-sdp-01.txt,
      APP=multimedia-streaming.webcast, VER="

   Where the Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) indicates the documented 
   reference that created this well known string [ID-TRAF-CLASS], the 
   APP is the profile name with no spaces, and the "VER=" is included, 
   but has no value, but MAY if versioning becomes important.


3.5 The Conversational Profiles

   Conversational category is for realtime bidirectional 
   communications, such as voice or video, and is the most numerous due
   to the choices of application with or without adjectives. The number
   of profiles is then doubled because there needs to be one for 
   unadmitted and one for admitted.  The IANA section lists all that 
   are currently proposed for registration at this time, therefore 
   there will not be an exhaustive list provided in this section.

   There will be conversational profiles for 

   - Conversational Audio 
   - Conversational Audio Admitted
   - Conversational Video 
   - Conversational Video Admitted
   - Conversational Audio Avconf
   - Conversational Audio Avconf Admitted
   - Conversational Video Avconf
   - Conversational Video Avconf Admitted
   - Conversational Audio Immersive
   - Conversational Audio Immersive Admitted
   - Conversational Video Immersive
   - Conversational Video Immersive Admitted

   Here is an example profile for identifying Conversational Audio:

     APP_TC, POLICY_LOCATOR, ASCII_DN, 
     "GUID=http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/
                  draft-ietf-mmusic-traffic-class-for-sdp-01.txt,
     APP=conversational.audio, VER="

   Where the Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) indicates the documented 
   reference that created this well known string [ID-TRAF-CLASS], the 
   APP is the profile name with no spaces, and the "VER=" is included, 
   but has no value, but MAY if versioning becomes important.


4.  Security considerations

   The security considerations section within RFC 2872 sufficiently 
   covers this document, with one possible exception - someone using 
   the wrong template values (e.g., claiming a reservation is 
   Multimedia Streaming when it is in fact Real-time Interactive).  
   Given that each traffic flow is within separate reservations, and 
   RSVP does not have the ability to police the bits within any 
   reservation, solving for this appears to be administratively handled
   at best. This is not meant to be a 'punt', but there really is 
   nothing this template creates that is going to make things any 
   harder for anyone (that we know of now).


5.  IANA considerations

5.1 New RSVP Policy Element (P-Type) 

   In line with the convention created in RFC 3182, the following 
   P-Type is created in the RSVP Policy Element registry [TBD]:

     4   APP_TC      Traffic Class identification of applications

   [Editor's note: Unfortunately, RFC 2750 specified the creation of 
                   the "RSVP Policy Element" IANA registration, which 
                   does not appear at the 
                   http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-parameters 
                   page, therefore it appears this registry does not 
                   yet exist. We will get with the chairs to work on 
                   this.]


5.2 Application Profiles

   This document requests IANA create a new registry for the 
   application identification classes similar to the following table 
   within the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Parameters registry:

   Registry Name: RSVP APP-ID Profiles
   Reference: [this document]
   Registration procedures: Standards Track document [RFC5226]

Appendix - Changes to ID

A.1 - Changes from Individual -02 to -03

   The following changes were made in this version:

   - Added [ID-TRAF-CLASS] as a reference

   - Changed to a new format of the profile string.

   - Added many new profiles based on the new format into each parent 
     category of Section 3.

   - changed the GUID to refer to draft-ietf-mmusic-traffic-class-for-
     sdp-01.txt

   - changed 'desktop' adjective to 'avconf' to keep in alignment with 
     draft-ietf-mmusic-traffic-class-for-sdp-01.txt

   - Have a complete IANA Registry proposal for each application-ID 
     discussed in this draft.

   - General text clean-up of the draft.
