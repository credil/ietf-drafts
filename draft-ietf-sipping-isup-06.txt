This document describes a way to perform the mapping between two
signaling protocols: the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) User Part (ISUP) of
Signaling System No. 7 (SS7).  This mechanism might be implemented
when using SIP in an environment where part of the call involves
interworking with the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).

This document is a product of the Session Initiation Proposal
Investigation Working Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.
