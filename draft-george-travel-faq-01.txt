      IETF meeting attendees' Frequently Asked (travel) Questions
                       draft-george-travel-faq-01

Abstract

   This document attempts to provide a list of the common Frequently
   Asked Questions (FAQs) that IETF meeting attendees often ask
   regarding travel logistics and local information.  It is intended to
   assist those who are willing to provide local information, so that if
   they wish to pre-populate answers to some or all of these questions
   either in the IETF Wiki or a meeting-specific site, they have a
   reasonably complete list of ideas to draw from.  It is not meant as a
   list of required information that the host or secretariat needs to
   provide, merely as a guideline.

1.  Introduction

   IETF attendees come from all over the world.  The typical IETF
   meeting has representatives from in excess of 50 countries.  As such,
   it is quite likely that a large portion of the participants in any
   given IETF are newcomers to the specific location where it is being
   held.  It is also possible that this is their first trip to the
   country or region.  As such, they are going to have questions
   regarding their own personal travel needs and logistics that may only
   be answerable by someone who has either been to the area before,
   someone who lives there, and/or someone who speaks the local
   language.

   While the IETF, its secretariat, and any local host organizations
   responsible for the logistics of making IETF meetings happen are not
   travel agencies, there is a set of information that most travelers
   wish to have while they are planning their trip.  This document
   attempts to cover the most commonly asked questions and categories
   for information.  This document is not intended to provide answers to
   these questions for every possible location in which IETF meetings
   may be held.  Rather, it is intended to provide a set of FAQs for use
   by the hosts and others who have experience with the area where the
   event is being held, so that the questions and answers can be handled
   more efficiently than waiting until someone sends an email to the
   XXattendees@ietf.org list in the days leading up to the meeting.


2.  Why is this document necessary?

   In reading this document, one may ask, "why would such a
   technologically advanced and internet-savvy organization need such
   help?  Isn't that why search engines exist?"  And the answer is that
   yes, we can sometimes find what we're looking for with search
   engines, but that results in hundreds of people spending their time
   searching, which is not very efficient.  In addition, despite the
   widely held belief that if it is published on the Internet, it
   therefore must be true, sometimes the information that is available
   is either inaccurate, incomplete, or out of date, so it may well be
   less reliable than firsthand info from someone that has been there.
   Also, no matter how good online translation is getting, some of the
   most informative sites may be difficult for non-native speakers to
   navigate and find information - navigation buttons, graphics, and
   other active content are typically not machine-translatable, and non-
   native speakers may not realize when machine translation is
   inaccurate in a critical way.

   For some past IETF meetings, the hosting organization has set up a
   special website, usually containing "IETF" and the number of the

   meeting (e.g. ietf75.se [STOCKHOLM], ietf71.comcast.net [PHILLY],
   etc).  This has been a source of much additional information about
   the location, and is always quite helpful.  If the host decides to
   set up a site like this, the hope is that this document will provide
   guidance as to the sorts of information with which to populate such a
   site.  However, it is by no means a requirement that the host set up
   an external website.  Further, not every IETF meeting has a local
   host, or even a host at all.  In these cases, the need for the same
   set of information is not lessened, but the IETF will be more reliant
   on the willingness of those with experience in the area where the
   meeting will be held to share the benefit of that experience with
   others.  The IETF has provided a hosted Wiki [WIKI] which can simply
   be populated with the same sorts of information.  This has the added
   benefit of having a single location where additional information can
   be provided by experienced travelers, locals, and host
   representatives alike.  In the case where the IETF-hosted Wiki is to
   be used, this document may serve as a framework of categories that
   could be pre-built when the site-specific page is set up, so that
   others can begin populating the information.


3.  Helpful information

   There are a number of general categories of information listed below.
   Some of it is necessary for travel, the rest can be considered nice-
   to-have at best.  All of it has come from actual frequently asked
   questions from the attendees mailing lists.

   Much of this information may already be available in another form
   online.  There is no need to reproduce information that can be found
   on external websites, so simply providing pointers to information
   already available in other locations is quite appropriate.  However,
   it is very helpful if some validation and vetting of the provided
   information is performed in order to avoid outdated or inaccurate
   information.

3.1.  Travel

   o  Recommended airport(s) for domestic and international connections
      - include the appropriate IATA Airport code(s) whenever possible
      to avoid confusion.

   o  Transit between primary hotels and the airport

      *  estimated time

      *  Taxi information

         +  credit cards accepted?

         +  Estimated costs for Taxis

         +  description of "official" taxis if appropriate

         +  Links to websites or phone numbers for remote/pre-booking
            Taxis

         +  printable local-language address card to show taxi driver in
            case of language barrier

         +  Ride sharing - the IETF Wiki usually has a section where
            attendees can post arrival times and work out Taxi sharing

      *  Mass Transit - navigating an unfamiliar mass transit system can
         be challenging.  Things that seem obvious to the locals may not
         be as obvious to out-of-town travelers.

         +  English map

         +  How and where to purchase farecards/tokens

         +  How to use tickets/tokens (where to insert them, get them
            stamped, how to transfer, etc)

         +  how trains/buses are labeled and how to identify the
            destination of a particular train/bus

         +  nearby stations

      *  Shuttles (if applicable)

   o  Getting to/from the conference venue

      *  same info as for airport transit

   o  Parking availability and costs for those driving to the venue or
      hotel

3.2.  Food

   It's generally helpful to note whether restaurants require/recommend
   reservations, if they have busy/rush times, etc.

   o  Restaurants, categorized by:

      *  price

      *  proximity to venue

         +  useful to highlight quick options for lunch breaks

      *  type of cuisine

         +  this is a great place to highlight local specialties and
            favorites

      *  special dietary needs

         +  Vegan/Vegetarian

         +  Halal/Kosher

         +  a more in-depth discussion of this can be found in
            [I-D.barnes-healthy-food]

   o  Local grocery/convenience stores - for those who cannot find
      restaurant options which meet their dietary need

   o  Coffee shops nearby - specifically, where is the best espresso?

   o  Bars/pubs nearby

   o  restaurants/pubs with private rooms or large seating areas for big
      groups

3.3.  International considerations

   o  Plug type/voltage - this can simply be a reference to
      electricaloutlet.org [PLUGS] unless there are specific exceptions
      or details that need to be highlighted

   o  Health and Safety

      *  phone numbers to access local emergency services (e.g. 911,
         999, etc)

      *  tap water safe to drink?

      *  areas of high crime to avoid

      *  common local scams

      *  smoking rules

         +  are most bars/restaurants smoking or non-smoking?  Separate
            smoking section?

         +  Rules on smoking in public places?

         +  Rules on smoking outdoors?

   o  Visa requirements, pointers regarding travel documents

   o  Languages commonly spoken

3.3.1.  Money

   o  General credit card acceptance in common locations, including any
      restrictions (requires a PIN or chip, no AMEX, etc)

   o  ATM locations near the venue, at the airport

   o  Tipping customs, particularly for Taxis, restaurants, and hotel
      staff

   o  Currency conversion rate - a reference to a currency converter
      site, e.g.  Yahoo!  [CURRENCY] will suffice unless there are
      specific conversion details that one believes to be relevant

3.4.  Communications and electronics

   o  Places to purchase local SIMs, and types of mobile voice/data
      service supported, (e.g.  GSM, LTE, UMTS, CDMA, etc)

   o  places to get replacement electronics and accessories (e.g. power
      cords, adaptors, etc)

   o  Public Wi-Fi access (outside of hotel and venue)

3.5.  Weather

   o  link to a site or brief info on temperature and humidity norms for
      the time of year when the meeting will be held

   o  this also refers to indoor weather: what is the common indoor
      temperature?

3.6.  Fitness

   o  Soccer: If the weather cooperates, it is common for some IETFers
      to try to hold a "soccer BoF" - a pick-up soccer game sometime
      during the week of IETF.  If you know of a field appropriate for
      soccer in proximity to the venue, this is useful information to
      have.

   o  Running/walking paths or routes - some folks prefer this method
      for exercise over using a treadmill

3.7.  Tourism

   While this is certainly not necessary information for the primary
   goal of an IETF attendee, many attendees earmark a day or two on
   either side of the conference for sightseeing, and this is an
   opportunity to highlight local attractions.  Links to sites
   containing information about walking tours, local tourist attractions
   and the like are certainly appreciated.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document is not a protocol specification and therefore contains
   no protocol security considerations.  However, some of the above
   items refer to the physical security of IETF participants and their
   property.  This document is not intended to be a comprehensive
   discussion of physical security matters for IETF attendees.
