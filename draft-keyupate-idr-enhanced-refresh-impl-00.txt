1.  Introduction

   It is sometimes necessary to perform routing consistency validations
   such as checking for possible missing withdraws between BGP speakers
   [RFC4271].  Currently such validations typically involve off-line,
   manual operations which can be tedious and time consuming.  BGP
   Enhanced Route Refresh enhances the existing BGP route refresh
   mechanism to provide for the demarcation of the beginning and the
   ending of a route refresh (which refers to the complete re-
   advertisement of the Adj-RIB-Out to a peer, subject to routing
   policies).  BGP Enhanced Route refresh can be used to facilitate on-
   line, non-disruptive consistency validation of BGP routing updates.

   This document provides an implementation report for BGP Enhanced
   Route Refresh as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-enhanced-route-refresh].
