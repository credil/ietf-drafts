Internet-Draft       PRECIS for HTTP Authentication            July 2013


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   This document describes how to handle Unicode strings representing
   user names and passwords for HTTP authentication.

   For a long time starting HTTP/1.0 [RFC1945], character encodings of
   HTTP authentication related parameters are defined and handled quite
   loosely.  [RFC1945] defined user-names of Basic authentication to be
   a subset of ASCII strings (token), and passwords to be assumed as
   ISO-8859-1 by recipients.  Initial version of HTTP/1.1 [RFC2068] and
   later revisions define grammar rules which indirectly (through the
   definition of "TEXT" element) insist that both user-names and
   passwords are in ISO-8859-1.  In any way, these definitions are quite
   often disregarded, and implementations tend to use their local
   character sets and encodings, which has caused several
   interoperability problems.

   At the time of being (writing this document), the most promising way
   of solving this problem is to use Unicode [UNICODE] character set
   along with UTF-8 encoding [RFC3629] as a common vehicle.  However,
   just using UTF-8 does not completely solve the problem, or even makes
   it worse, because of the non-unique encoding nature of Unicode
   character sets.

   Recently, a PRECIS [I-D.ietf-precis-framework] framework is being
   standardized to cover this problem set.  It defines a framework to
   resolve non-uniqueness problem of Unicode character sets for
   information-comparison purposes, especially useful for user
   identifications.  This document describes how to apply the PRECIS
   framework for general HTTP user authentications, who to implement
   such framework, and how to use it.

1.2.  Applicability

   The rules defined in this document can be used in two ways: one way
   is to use them as MUST- (or SHOULD-) obey rules, by referring it from
   another standard or non-standard document.  In such case, the rules
   defined in this document will have a normative property.

   Another way is to use them as "best current practices", when some
   specific HTTP authentication scheme does not define any specific
   method of string preparations.  In such case, any implementations are
   not required to implement (or not to implement) the string
   preparation rule in this document, but using it may sometimes improve
   interoperability between implementations.

Internet-Draft       PRECIS for HTTP Authentication            July 2013


   Any specific authentication scheme MAY define its own string
   preparation method, especially when an underlying software layer
   supporting the authentication scheme (such as SASL) defines (or
   recommends) its own string preparation method.  In such cases,
   implementations SHOULD NOT use the preparation rules described in
   this document, and these SHOULD obey the scheme-specific requirement.

   It is not feasible to implement the string preparation within all
   HTTP implementations.  For interoperability of authentication
   process, only a small portion of involved softwares are required to
   actually implement the string preparation algorithms.  To this
   purpose, general application notes are provided in the latter part of
   this document.

1.3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


2.  Rules

   This section defines two PRECIS string preparation rules for user
   names and passwords.

   Note: the RFC 2119 requirements keywords such as "MUST" within this
   section are effective as the RFC keywords only when the application
   of these rules are either REQUIRED or RECOMMENDED by any
   authentication scheme definitions.

2.1.  User Names

2.1.1.  Definition

   User names are strings to identify the user in HTTP authentication.

      username       = 1*(idpoint)
                       ;
                       ; an "idpoint" is a UTF-8 encoded
                       ; Unicode code point that conforms to
                       ; the PRECIS "IdentifierClass"
                       ;

   Note that some authentication schemes like Basic MAY restrict several
   characters to be used in username.

Internet-Draft       PRECIS for HTTP Authentication            July 2013


   Note also that some authentication schemes like Digest modifies
   users' inputs to other forms like quoted-string.  This document
   specifies only string preparation.

2.1.2.  Preparation

   A user name MUST NOT be zero bytes in length.  This rule is to be
   enforced after any normalization and mapping of code points.

   Each username MUST conform to the definition of the PRECIS
   IdentifierClass provided in [I-D.ietf-precis-framework], where the
   width mapping, additional mapping, case mapping, normalization, and
   directionality rules are as described below.

   1.  Fullwidth and halfwidth characters MUST be mapped to their
       decomposition equivalents.
   2.  Additional mappings SHOULD NOT be applied, such as those defined
       in [I-D.ietf-precis-mappings], unless there are implementation-
       dependent reasons to do so, or these are exceptionally required
       by specific authentication schemes.
   3.  Case mapping is not applied.
   4.  Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC) MUST be applied to all
       characters.

   With regard to directionality, the "Bidi Rule" provided in [RFC5893]
   applies.

2.2.  Passwords

2.2.1.  Definition

   Passwords are strings to authenticate the user in HTTP
   authentication.

      password       = 1*(freepoint)
                       ;
                       ; a "freepoint" is a UTF-8 encoded
                       ; Unicode code point that conforms to
                       ; the PRECIS "FreeformClass"
                       ;

   Note that some authentication schemes MAY restrict several characters
   to be used in passwords.

2.2.2.  Preparation

   A password MUST NOT be zero bytes in length.  This rule is to be
   enforced after any normalization and mapping of code points.

Internet-Draft       PRECIS for HTTP Authentication            July 2013


   A password MUST be treated as follows, where the operations specified
   MUST be completed in the order shown:

   1.  Width mapping is not applied.
   2.  Map any instances of non-ASCII space to ASCII space (U+0020).
   3.  Case mapping is not applied.
   4.  Apply Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC) to all characters.
   5.  Ensure that the resulting string conforms to the definition of
       the PRECIS FreeformClass.

   With regard to directionality, the "Bidi Rule" (defined in [RFC5893])
   and similar rules do not apply.


3.  Application Notes

   Implementation of the above rules are sometimes resource-consuming
   and not realistic, especially when the implementation is not aware of
   any Unicode string and is handling the authentication credentials as
   opaque byte strings.  This section provides a general application
   notes for how to realize the above string preparation in the real
   software.

   Note: the note for RFC keywords in the previous section does apply
   also for this section.

   The general principle for the application is: "to send the string
   correctly, by some means."  In particular, if there is "some"
   provision (either manually or automatically) to ensure the correct
   encoding and preparation of string at the time of sending, it is
   considered enough.  As a definitive rule, the following provisions
   are to be taken:
   o  Recipient side (i.e.  HTTP servers) MAY omit any part of string
      preparation, including Unicode normalization.  It MAY process any
      received strings as is.
   o  Senders which forward already-prepared strings (i.e.  HTTP proxies
      etc.)  MAY omit any part of string preparation.
   o  Interactive clients which receive human users' input, as form of
      "characters", have an obligation to prepare the input string into
      a correct UTF-8 string with regards to the scheme-specific
      preparation rules.  When the authentication scheme specifies that
      the preparation is a MUST, they MUST do it.
   o  Clients which receive credentials in a form of "list of octets"
      (such as those within configuration files) MAY require its users
      to prepare the string correctly within configuration phases, and
      MAY omit any part of string preparation at runtime.

   As a reverse to these rules, any recipients MUST be prepared to



Oiwa, et al.             Expires January 9, 2014                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft       PRECIS for HTTP Authentication            July 2013


   receive any unprepared byte lists or character lists as inputs.  Such
   recipients MAY prepare the string by its own, MAY reject such inputs
   explicitly, or MAY process these inputs silently when it will lead to
   failed authentication attempts.  However, Such recipients MUST NOT
   process such inputs in any way which leads to false authentication
   successes (modulo cryptographically negligible level of
   probabilities).


4.  Design principles

   Note: the content of this section is not normative.

   The design of the rules provided in previous sections are made under
   the following concerns and observations.

   o  ASCII transparency:
      Every code-point within U+0020 to U+007E MUST be preserved,
      distinguished, and mapped to its one-byte equivalent respectively.
      This is a strong requirement for compatibility with existing HTTP
      authentication.
   o  Latin-1 preservation:
      Code-points U+00A1 to U+00FE SHOULD be preserved and distinguished
      in the output string.  This enables non-crashing mapping from
      existing ISO-8859-1 user databases, and, if applicable, enables
      backward-compatible server-side implementation for Basic plain-
      text authentication.
   o  Case (non-)mapping:
      As a subset of the above two rules, no case mapping shall be
      applied (as a basic rule).  Without this, some existing user
      database will become non-useful, especially when it has already
      used a non-mapped credentials, and its entries are hashed or one-
      way encrypted.  The opposite case (case-mapped existing databases)
      can be at least worked around by users, server implementations, or
      both.
      Of course, some authentication schemes designed for specific use-
      cases can always define a case-folded mappings whenever needed.
   o  Strong normalizations:
      All representations (decomposed and composed) of every single
      "character" within Unicode MUST be normalized to exactly one UTF-8
      byte sequence.  Without this, virtually all "non-Basic"
      authentication may become broken with regard to internationalized
      username and passwords (e.g.  Digest).


5.  Security Considerations

   As mentioned previously, any recipients MUST NOT assume that senders



Oiwa, et al.             Expires January 9, 2014                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       PRECIS for HTTP Authentication            July 2013


   will always send a correctly-prepared strings.  Care must be taken
   that incorrectly-prepared strings MUST lead to either a correct
   result or an authentication failure.


6.  IANA Considerations

   [[TBD: more precise IANA Considerations here.]]

   The IANA shall add the following two entries to the PRECIS Usage
   Registry:
