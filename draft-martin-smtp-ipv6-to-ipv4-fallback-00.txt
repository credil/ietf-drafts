1.  Introduction

   The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is defined in [RFC5321].
   Section 5 of that document describes the process of host selection.
   SMTP clients in well known Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) software will
   retry a message using a different Mail Exchanger (MX) or network
   address if the message is temporarily rejected.  This document
   describes under which circumstances well known and widely deployed
   open source MTAs (and others) can be made to retry over IPv4 when an
   initial connection to IPv6 results in a temporary rejection.
   Furthermore, the purpose of this document is to record that behaviour
   and encourage its further adoption while at the same time providing
   for the future a well defined mechanism via a service extension with
   cooperating SMTP clients.  This behavior could be useful in, for
   instance, enforcing higher requirements for Simple Mail Transfer
   Protocol (SMTP) sessions over IPv6 than what exists on IPv4 without
   simply rejecting the message outright.

1.1.  Moving from IP Reputation to Domain Based Reputation

   IPv6 brings more IP addresses, which means building an IP-based
   reputation system using IPv6 addresses could be difficult to achieve.

Internet-Draft         SMTP IPv6 to IPv4 Fallback          November 2013


   Moving from an IP based reputation system to a domain based
   reputation system is expected to be easier.  However, it requires
   that all SMTP servers participate.

   IPv4 address space is well known and many tools have been built to
   handle unwanted emails from certain IPv4 addresses.  There is not yet
   such expertise on IPv6 nor tools.  However, labels, like domain names
   are more stable, unlike the more dynamic nature of IP address
   allocation, and provide a relatively better chain to associate an
   email to its author, provided such labels can be authentified.  Such
   labels allow better reporting of unwanted emails to the system
   administrators of mail servers in these domains.

   As IPv6 is still relatively nascent, there is a chance to mandate use
   of the Sender Policy Framework (SPF, [RFC4408]) or DomainKeys
   Identified Mail (DKIM, [RFC6376]) or similar domain-based
   authentication mechanisms for messages sent over IPv6 and, if these
   fail, to do retries over IPv4.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Indicating the sender-SMTP server to fall back to IPv4

   To move from IP based reputation to a domain based reputation system
   for email, a receiver-SMTP could, for example, require that messages
   pass SPF [RFC6652] or DKIM [RFC6376].  This section does not discuss
   the merit of such policy but proposes mechanisms for any policy to
   get the sender-SMTP to fall back to IPv4 from an IPv6 connection.

3.1.  With the service extension IPV6-IPV4-FALLBACK

   The receiver-SMTP MAY addvertise a service extension
   IPV6-IPV4-FALLBACK, which the sender-SMTP replies by
   IPV6-IPV4-FALLBACK if capable

   In this condition for each message not acceptable due to policy where
   a retry over IPv4 is requested, the sender-SMTP server MUST reply by
   the reply code 456, where the sender-SMTP requeues the message for
   immediate retry by selecting a receiver, according to Section 5 of
   [RFC5321], that is at an IPv4 address..

   If there is no IPv4 address to be tried, the sender-SMTP SHOULD fail
   the message.

Internet-Draft         SMTP IPv6 to IPv4 Fallback          November 2013


   If the receiver-SMTP implements enhanced status codes [RFC5248], The
   SMTP enhanced status code SHOULD be 4.4.8.

   Example status message

            456 4.4.8 please retry immediately the message over IPv4
            because it fails SPF and DKIM


   The SMTP status code 456 is introduced in this document, and has a
   very specific meaning associated to the service extension.  The SMTP
   enhanced status code is also introduced in this document, but like
   all enhanced status codes, they are usually not interpreted by the
   SMTP client, but for the bounce processor as to provide more
   meaningful reports to the mail administrator.

3.2.  Without service extension

   The receiver-SMTP server MUST have MX RR pointing to single stack
   hostnames and for same MX RR preference MUST have a MX RR pointing to
   an hostname with an A RR and a MX RR pointing to an hostname with an
   AAAA RR.  No hostname pointed by a MX RR have a A RR and an AAAA RR.

   For example:

      example.org.            IN MX   1  mx1-6.example.org.
                              IN MX   1  mx1.example.org
                              IN MX   10 mx10-6.example.org.
                              IN MX   10 mx10.example.org
      mx1-6.example.org.      IN AAAA 2001:db8:ffff::1
      mx1.example.org.        IN A    192.0.2.1
      mx10-6.example.org.     IN AAAA 2001:db8:ffff::2
      mx10.example.org        IN A    192.0.2.2


   When a receiver-SMTP makes a policy decision not to accept a message
   over IPv6, it rejects the message with a 451 code if done at
   connection time and 421 code if done later and terminates the
   connection so the sender-SMTP requeues the message for immediate
   retry by selecting a receiver, according to Section 5 of [RFC5321],
   that is at an IPv4 address..

   If the receiver-SMTP implements enhanced status codes [RFC5248], The
   SMTP enhanced status code SHOULD be 4.4.8.

   The rejection at connection time MAY be issued only when it has been
   demonstrated that a majority of messages would not pass the policy
   and that the sender-SMTP is not capable of the service extension
   IPV6-IPV4-FALLBACK.

   The rejection at connection time SHOULD be for a limited time to give
   a chance for later messages to be re-evaluted against the policy.

   456 is not used here, as it is a new SMTP status code introduced for
   clients that understand the service extension IPV6-IPV4-FALLBACK.  It
   is not sure that sender-SMTP without this service extension would
   behave as expected with a new SMTP status code.

   Research presented in annexes has shown that common MTA exhibit this
   behavior.

4.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Murray Kucheraway for guidance in getting this draft out.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This section describes actions requested of IANA.

5.1.  SMTP Enhanced Status Codes Registry update

   IANA is requested to add the following to the Simple Mail Transfer
   Protocol (SMTP) Enhanced Status Codes Registry:

   o  Enumerated Status Codes

   o  Code: X.4.8

   o  Summary: retry on IPv4

   o  Associated basic status code: 421,451,456

   o  Description: the mail system will not accept this message over
      IPv6 because it lacks some requirments described in the full text
      of the rejection, however the sending mail system can retry
      immediately to submit the message over IPv4 only.

5.2.  Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) Service Extensions Registry
      update

   IANA is requested to add the following to the Simple Mail Transfer
   Protocol (SMTP) Service Extensions Registry:

   o  Textual name: Capable to retry the message over IPv4 from IPv6 if
      requested

   o  EHLO Keyword: IPV6-IPV4-FALLBACK

   o  There is no parameters associated with the extension

   o  SMTP verb: IPV6-IPV4-FALLBACK

   o  Description: When the server indicates the service extension and
      the client indicates via the SMTP verb that it supports such
      extension, if the server rejects the message with the status code
      456, the client will requeue the message to be delivered over
      IPv4.

   o  This extension does not increase the length of the MAIL and RCPT
      commands

6.  Security Considerations

   SMTP clients might not not fall back to IPv4 when requested (by not
   implementing this proposal) and keep retrying on IPv6.  MTA
   administrators ought to monitor for such servers, and could whitelist
   them to accept messages over IPv6 or take other action as
   appropriate.

   Messages may start to queue on the sender-SMTP side and the mail
   administrator may not notice it or take appropriate action in time.

   If the policy is not explained clearly the mail administrator may not
   know what is required to pass the policy.

   If the policy is to cumbersome and is not based on widely adopted
   standards and recommendations, the mail administrator may decide not
   to jump through hoops to get the email delivered.

   The fall back mechanism without service extension may create
   unecessary burden for the sender as well as the receiver.

         Message is then retried immediately over IPv4


A.3.  Common Open Source MTA Design

   This secton discusses current implementations in common open source
   MTAs.

   SMTP clients only interpret SMTP status codes, but the use of SMTP
   enhanced status codes can be used to better monitor and act on the
   reason of the temporary failure.

   For instance, at the end of DATA, if the message was sent over IPv6,
   the SMTP server can evalute whether the message passes SPF or DKIM
   and reject the message using 421 if neither pass.  If one passes,
   then an authenticated domain name is available and domain reputation
   rules can be applied.  The IPv6 address of the SMTP client can be
   noted, and futher connections over IPv6 can be temporarily failed
   using the 451 status code for some period of time period so as to
   minimize resources to evaluate each message after the end of DATA.
   On the other hand, if a message coming from an IPv6 address does not
   pass SPF or DKIM, it is unlikely that this state would quickly change
   for the next message coming from the same network address.

Internet-Draft         SMTP IPv6 to IPv4 Fallback          November 2013


   For proprietary mail systems or large mailbox providers, they all do
   a form of domain authentication, either SPF or DKIM, so the above may
   not apply to them.  Not all are yet enabled to send email over IPv6.

   Some observations:

   o  When presented with a permanent failure code (5yz) during
      connection establishment, MTA clients will declare the message non
      deliverable and will not retry it on a different MX.  Some clients
      do retry however.

   o  When an SMTP server rejects during the connection phase using the
      code 451 and disconnects, the SMTP client will typically retry the
      message immediately on a different MX.

   o  When an SMTP server rejects after the DATA phase using a 421 SMTP
      reply code followed by a disconnect, the SMTP client will retry
      the message immediately on a different MX.

   MX RR configuration and the proper rejection need both to be properly
   defined.

A.3.1.  MX RR configuration

   When a message is temporarily refused, using a 400-series SMTP error
   code, the strategy for the SMTP client is sometimes to retry
   immediately to a different MTA, as defined by the target selection
   process defined in [RFC5321].

   When the new MX refers to a dual-stacked machine (see [RFC3974]),
   some MTA software will not pick up all of the A or AAAA RRs (Resource
   Records), but will instead select only the RRs matching the address
   family preferred by the local TCP/IP implementation.  Thus, MX RRs
   MUST NOT refer to dual-stacked machines.

   For instance, the following configuration is desired:

      example.org.            IN MX   10  mx1.example.org.
                              IN MX   10 mx1-6.example.org.
      mx1.example.org.        IN A    192.0.2.1
      mx1-6.example.org.      IN AAAA 2001:db8:ffff::1

Internet-Draft         SMTP IPv6 to IPv4 Fallback          November 2013


   In this configuration, the SMTP client see two MXes at the same
   preference, and will automatically pick one and try the other one if
   the message is properly temp-failed.  Therefore, in the above
   example, if the first connection was over IPv6 and the message
   temporarly refused and the session disconnected, the next connection
   will be over IPv4.

A.3.2.  Rejecting Messages for Immediate Retry on IPv4

   Here is an example of an initial message sent over IPv6.  The SMTP
   client then retries immediately on the next MX record, here an IPv4
   address.  "S" indicates text sent by a server, and "C" indicates text
   sent by a client.  Line terminations are omitted in this
   illustration.
