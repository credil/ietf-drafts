    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes one of the network models that
	are designed for smooth transition to IPv6.
	It is called NAT444 model. NAT444 model is composed of IPv6,
	and IPv4 with Carrier Grade (CGN).</t>

      <t>NAT444 is the only scheme not to require replacing Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) even if IPv4 address exhausted.  But it must be noted that NAT444 has serious restrictions i.e. it limits the number of sessions per CPE so that rich applications such as AJAX and RSS feed cannot work well.</t>

      <t>Therefore, IPv6 which is free from such a difficulty has to be introduced into the network at the same time.  In other words, NAT444 is just a tool to make IPv6 transition easy to be swallowed.  It is designed for the days IPv4 and IPv6 co-existence.</t>
    </abstract>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
<t>The only permanent solution of the IPv4 address exhaustion is to deploy IPv6. Now, just before the exhaustion, it's time to make a transition to IPv6.</t>

<t>After the exhaustion, unless ISP takes any action, end users will not be able to get IPv4 address.</t>

<t>The servers that have only IPv4 address will continue to exist on the Internet after the IPv4 address exhaustion.
In this situation, IPv6 only hosts cannot reach IPv4 only hosts.</t>

<t>This document explains NAT444 model that bridges the gap between the coming IPv6 Internet and the present IPv4 Internet.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Definition of NAT444 Model">
      <t>NAT444 Model is a network model that uses
	two Network Address and Port Translators (NAPTs)
	with three types of IPv4 address blocks.</t>
      <t>The first NAPT is in CPE, and the second NAPT is in
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-lsn-requirements">Carrier Grade NAT (CGN)</xref>.
	CGN is supposed to be installed in the ISP's network.</t>

      <t>The first IPv4 address block is
	<xref target="RFC1918">Private Address</xref> inside CPE.
	The second one is an IPv4 Address block between CPEs and CGN.
	The third one is IPv4 Global Addresses that is outside CGN.
	The ISPs using NAT444 provide IPv6 connectivity by dual stack model.</t>

      <t>The IPv6 packets from the host reach the IPv6 Internet without using NAT functionality.</t>

<t>The following figure shows the behavior of the IPv4 packet from the host to the IPv4 server via two NATs. The first NAT in CPE overwrites the Source IP Address and Source Port from 10.0.0.2:tt to w.w.w.w:uu. Then the second NAT in CGN overwrites them from w.w.w.w:uu to y.y.y.y:vv. 
 Destination IP Address and Port are not overwritten.</t>

      <section anchor="cons" title="Cons of NAT444 Model">
	<t>This network model has some technical restrictions.</t>

	<t>- Some application such as SIP requires special treatment,
	  because IP address is written in the payload of the packet.
	  Special treatment means application itself aware double NAPT
	  or both of two NAPTs support inspecting and rewriting the packets.
	  <vspace blankLines="0" />
	  - Because both IPv4 route and IPv6 route exist,
	  it doubles the number of IGP route inside the CGN.
	  <vspace blankLines="0" />

      <t>The steps of IPv6 transition are as follows.</t>

      <t>Step 1: Enabling softwire client in host</t>

      <t>ISP provides IPv6 connectivity to customers with <xref target="RFC4925">softwire</xref>. ISP installs CGN and softwire concentrator in its network. A softwire client in host connects to the IPv6 internet via ISP's concentrator.
ISP can use existing IPv4 equipments. Customers can just use existing CPE.</t>
