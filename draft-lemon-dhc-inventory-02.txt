          Techniques for Tracking Inventory Using DHCPv6 DUID
                      draft-lemon-dhc-inventory-02

Abstract

   In the years since DHCPv4 gained widespread popularity, one of the
   uses to which organizations have put it is inventory tracking:
   associating identifiers scanned from packaging with records in an
   inventory database.  This document describes various means for
   accomplishing the same purpose using DHCPv6.  This document also
   updates RFC3315 by clarifying the meaning of some normative language
   regarding the DUID-LL and DUID-LLT DUID types.

1.  Introduction

   In DHCPv4 DHCPv4 [RFC2131], the link-layer address of a DHCP client
   is commonly used to identify the client.  The link-layer address
   appears in the chaddr field of the DHCP packet, and is also
   frequently included in the Client Identifier option.

Internet-Draft     Tracking Inventory with DHCPv6 DUID      October 2013


   Not coincidentally, the link-layer addresses of network devices are
   almost always present as bar codes and machine-readable text on the
   outside of the boxes in which these devices are delivered.  This is
   true of most mobile phones, laptop computers, desktop computers,
   network routers and switches, and so on.

   Services providers and enterprises have taken advantage of these two
   facts in their inventory tracking systems: when a new device arrives,
   the bar codes are scanned into a database, and an inventory tracking
   number is assigned to the device.  When the device is assigned to a
   user or to a use, that information can be added to the database.

   This means that, for example, when a network router is installed, the
   inventory tracking system can be updated both with the physical
   location of the router and with its intended purpose: for example,
   "router between backbone and first floor network."  This information
   can in turn be used to provision the router: to send it a
   configuration.  When a router is replaced, the provisioning system
   can then automatically configure the new router simply by knowing
   that it is the "router between backbone and first floor network";
   DHCPv4 takes care of noticing that the device is new on the network,
   and that can trigger the provisioning of the device.

   Unlike DHCPv4, DHCPv6 [RFC3315] does not directly make use of a
   device's link-layer address as an identifier.  This is because the
   link-layer address is specific to an interface, and it was considered
   useful to be able to notice that requests being issued on multiple
   interfaces related to the same device.  It was also considered useful
   that the device's identifier remain stable when network hardware was
   added or removed.

   Consequently, the inventory management solution in DHCPv6 is somewhat
   more complicated than that in DHCPv4.  This document describes
   several mechanisms that are available to administrators to address
   this concern.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Scope of applicability

   This document is intended to provide guidance to implementors of DHCP
   servers, network device inventory management systems and provisioning
   systems as to how to connect information sent over the network by
   devices with the physical devices that sent the information.

Internet-Draft     Tracking Inventory with DHCPv6 DUID      October 2013


   Nothing in this document should be construed as a requirement for
   such systems; rather, it is intended as helpful advice.  The
   normative language in the document applies to implementations that
   attempt to follow the advice given in this document, and is not
   intended to apply to systems that solve the same problem in different
   ways.

2.  General Mechanism

   This mechanism takes as its input two pieces of information: one of
   the link-layer addresses of a device, and the DUID of the device.  If
   the DUID is known, the link-layer address MUST be ignored.  If the
   DUID is unknown, the link-layer address is used to find the the
   inventory record for the device, and then the the DUID is added to
   the inventory record.

2.1.  Entering a new device into inventory

   We assume that when a new device arrives, the box has one bar code on
   the side for the link layer address of each network interface on the
   device.  The person responsible for receiving the device scans each
   bar code off of the box.  This person then generates an inventory
   control tag for the device, and scans that into the system as well.
   The inventory control tag is affixed to the device in a location
   where it can be easily scanned or read in the future.

   Suppose a new router arrives.  It has two network interfaces: one
   with a link-layer address of 00:53:01:1f:24:32 and one with a link-
   layer address of 00:53:02:05:49:ad.  The device is assigned an
   inventory control tag number of 11029938.  This will produce several
   rows in a database table listing link-layer addresses:

                 +--------------------+------------------+
                 | link-layer address | inventory number |
                 +--------------------+------------------+
                 | 00:53:01:1f:24:32  |     11029938     |
                 | 00:53:02:05:49:ad  |     11029938     |
                 +--------------------+------------------+

              Table 1: Link Layer address to Inventory Table

   It will also produce one additional row in a database table listing
   inventory items:

         +------------------+-------------+------+-------+------+
         | inventory number | description | DUID | user? | use  |
         +------------------+-------------+------+-------+------+
         |     11029938     |    router   | NULL | false | NULL |

Internet-Draft     Tracking Inventory with DHCPv6 DUID      October 2013


         +------------------+-------------+------+-------+------+

                      Table 2: Inventory Items Table

   Note that the DUID and use fields are NULL at this point, because the
   device hasn't yet been assigned a user, and has never been connected
   to the network.  The user field in this example is a flag indicating
   whether the device will be assigned to the user (true), or is
   infrastructure equipment (false).

2.2.  Distributing the new device

   Eventually the new device is moved from inventory to its intended
   use: either on a machine room rack somewhere, or to a user's desk,
   for example.  When this happens, the inventory record is updated; the
   link layer address records are not:

    +------------------+-------------+------+-------+-----------------+
    | inventory number | description | DUID | user? |       use       |
    +------------------+-------------+------+-------+-----------------+
    |     11029938     |    router   | NULL | false | bb::first floor |
    +------------------+-------------+------+-------+-----------------+

               Table 3: Inventory Items Table (distributed)

   In this example the router is marked with a token that will be
   meaningful to the provisioning system: "backbone::first floor".

2.3.  First appearance on the network

   Now the device is plugged into a rack in a distribution closet; one
   network interface is plugged into the backbone network; the other is
   plugged into the cascade of switches that support the first floor
   network.  The device is powered on.

   When the device is powered on, it first does router solicitation and
   gets a prefix on the backbone network (we assume that there is no
   router on the first floor network, so it doesn't get a prefix there).
   The prefix is marked with the 'M' bit, indicating that this is a
   managed network, so the router issues a DHCP Solicit message.

   The solicit messages is received by the DHCP server.  The DHCP server
   does not have a record of the DUID presented by the router, so it
   logs it as unknown in the provisioning system and does nothing
   further.  The DHCP server provides both the link-layer address of the
   router's interface on the backbone network, and the DUID that the
   router presented.

Internet-Draft     Tracking Inventory with DHCPv6 DUID      October 2013


   If the DHCP server and router are connected to the same physical
   link, the DHCP server can acquire the router's link-layer address
   from the link-layer framing of the DHCP Solicit message.  Otherwise,
   the server must obtain the link-layer address using the techniques
   described in Sections 3 or, if possible, 4.

   In this example we'll assume that the link-layer address the router
   sent is 00:53:01:1f:24:32, and that the DUID is
   00:03:00:01:00:53:02:05:49:ad.

   The provisioning system takes the log entry for the unknown device
   and does a lookup in the Inventory Items table for the DUID that the
   router presented.  The DUID is not in the table, so the provisioning
   system gets an empty result table, indicating that the DUID is
   currently unknown to the provisioning system.

   The provisioning system then looks up the link-layer address in the
   Link Layer Address to Inventory table.  This produces a result table
   with a single row:

                 +--------------------+------------------+
                 | link-layer address | inventory number |
                 +--------------------+------------------+
                 | 00:53:01:1f:24:32  |     11029938     |
                 +--------------------+------------------+

           Table 4: Link Layer address to Inventory Result Table

   The provisioning system now uses the inventory number to find the
   inventory table entry and update it with the DUID; after this is
   done, the record looks like this:

   +-----------+-------------+-------------------+---------+-----------+
   | inventory | description |        DUID       |  user?  |    use    |
   |   number  |             |                   |         |           |
   +-----------+-------------+-------------------+---------+-----------+
   |  11029938 |    router   |    00:03:00:01    |  false  | bb::first |
   |           |             | 00:53:02:05:49:ad |         |   floor   |
   +-----------+-------------+-------------------+---------+-----------+

                 Table 5: Inventory Items Table (finished)

   The provisioning system now has enough information to configure the
   DHCP server with an IP address specific to the router, and to
   configure the router itself with information about prefixes on the
   first floor network.  How this is done is beyond the scope of this
   document.

3.  Using DUID-LL or DUID-LLT

   RFC3315 defines the DHCP Unique Identifier (DUID) and describes
   several different formats suited to various uses.  Two of those
   formats, DUID-LL and DUID-LLT, include the link-layer address of the
   client.  RFC3315 states:

      Clients and servers MUST treat DUIDs as opaque values and MUST
      only compare DUIDs for equality.  Clients and servers MUST NOT in
      any other way interpret DUIDs.  Clients and servers MUST NOT
      restrict DUIDs to the types defined in this document, as
      additional DUID types may be defined in the future.

   This text is specifically intended to exclude the possibility that
   the DHCP server might treat some portion of the DUID, rather than the
   entire DUID, as a unique identifier for the client.  However, the
   text is stated so unequivocally that it is often interpreted to mean
   that it's not permissible to look at the contents of the option for
   any other reason; this was not the original intent of the
   requirement.

   We therefore update the above paragraph from RFC3315 as follows:

      Clients and servers MUST NOT use any part of a DUID as a unique
      identifier.  Clients and servers MUST use the entire contents of
      the DUID as an opaque token for the purpose of uniquely
      identifying the client.  Clients and servers MUST NOT restrict
      DUIDs to the types defined in this document, as additional DUID
      types may be defined in the future.  Clients and servers MAY use
      the semantic contents of the DUID to generate a one-time mapping
      between a link-layer address known to be configured in a specific
      device, and that device's DUID.

   This change to RFC3315 allows DHCP servers or provisioning systems to
   use the link-layer address from a DUID-LL or DUID-LLT as input to the
   process described in Section 2 for mapping the DUID to a specific
   device in an inventory database.

   It is important to note that the usual reason for using a DUID-LLT,
   as opposed to a DUID, is that the network interface used to generate
   the DUID-LLT is not permanently installed in the device.  This means
   that there is no assurance that a device that came with a removable
   network interface will not have a new interface installed when it
   generates its DUID.  In that case, the device will present an unknown
   link-layer address to the DHCP server in the DUID-LLT.

   For this reason, nodes that contain both removable and fixed
   interfaces MUST use the link-layer address of a fixed interface when

Internet-Draft     Tracking Inventory with DHCPv6 DUID      October 2013


   generating a DUID-LL or DUID-LLT.  Devices using the link-layer
   address of a fixed interface to generate the DUID SHOULD use DUID-LL,
   not DUID-LLT, since there is no benefit to the additional timestamp
   in DUID-LLT.

4.  Using the DHCPv6 Client Link-layer Address Option

   The DHCPv6 Client Link-layer Address option [RFC6939] is a new DHCPv6
   extension which allows the DHCPv6 relay agent to include the client's
   link-layer address as an option in the RELAY-FORW message.  The DHCP
   server can use the provided link-layer address as a key in the lookup
   described in Section 2.  Note that the link-layer address will come
   from the RELAY-FORW message, but the DUID to be mapped will come from
   the inner encapsulated packet-\u002Dfor example, a DHCP Solicit or
   other client-sourced packet.

5.  Which algorithm to use

   Since the use of DUID-LL and DUID-LLT is not required, it is best not
   to rely on these DUIDs as a source for the client's link-layer
   address.  If the client is connected to the same link as the server,
   the server SHOULD use the link-layer address presented by the client
   for the inventory table lookup.  If the client is configured through
   a relay, and the relay provides the Client Link-layer Address option,
   the server SHOULD use the contents of that option to identify the
   client.

6.  New labeling requirements

   The extra work involved in matching link-layer addresses to DUIDs is
   only necessary because network equipment boxes typically only have
   bar code labels for link-layer addresses and not for DUIDs.  It would
   greatly simplify inventory management for dual-stack and IPv6-only
   sites if these boxes were additionally labeled with DUIDs.

   However, this is not as simple as it sounds.  The problem is the
   DUID, like a link-layer address, is simply a sequence of octets.  A
   bar code containing a DUID would therefore be difficult to reliably
   distinguish from a link-layer address.  It might be possible for the
   person receiving the box to scan only the DUID.  However, this is an
   extra bit of training that would be required, and of course it is
   error-prone.

   For this reason, manufacturers of DHCPv6-capable network hardware
   with predetermined DUIDs are strongly encouraged to add a bar code
   label to the box containing the equipment with a DUID that matches
   the following ABNF [RFC5234]:

Internet-Draft     Tracking Inventory with DHCPv6 DUID      October 2013


      label = "DUID:" hex-sequence
      hex-sequence = hex-octet * ( ":" hex-sequence )
      hex-octet = hex-digit hex-digit
      hex-digit = %x30 - %x39 / %x41 - %x46


   For example, a device with a DUID in the DUID-LL format might might
   have a bar code that reads as follows:

      DUID:00:03:00:01:08:00:2b:4c:3d:9f


7.  Acknowledgments

   This document was motivated by my realization during a private
   conversation with Leaf Yeh that although this technique for mapping
   client link-layer addresses to inventory tracking systems is well-
   known to some experts in the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 user community, it has
   not been documented by the IETF, and that readers of RFC2131 and
   RFC3315 might therefore be unaware that this usage pattern exists.

   Thanks to Sten Carlsen, Niall O'Reilly and Simon Hobson for their
   careful review and discussion of this work.

8.  Security Considerations

   DHCP servers rely on information provided by the DHCP client to
   identify the client.  In DHCPv6, the server typically relies on the
   DUID to uniquely identify the client; unless the DHCP packet is
   authenticated in some way, one clients can masquerade as another by
   presenting that client's DUID instead of its own.

   This document proposes using one of the client's link-layer addresses
   as a means of identifying the client when it first connects to the
   network.  This mechanism presents the same sorts of risks as does
   using the DUID to identify the client.  Existing mitigation
   strategies in RFC3315 will work equally well to prevent clients from
   presenting fraudulent link-layer identifiers.

   In addition, there are several factors that make this less of an
   issue with the mechanisms described in this document.  First, the
   link-layer address is only used as an identifier the first time the
   client connects to the network; like leap-of-faith authentication,
   this presents a very brief window of opportunity for an attack using
   the link-layer address.

   Secondly, because the attack has to occur the first time the client
   connects to the network, it's more complicated to effect the attack:

   the attacker has to snoop the link-layer address from the wire, and
   then attempt a DHCP transaction before the legitimate client starts
   its DHCP transaction.  Provisioning software can detect such an
   attack, because two conflicting records for the same client will
   appear in the log in quick succession.  If the attacker happens to
   guess the same DUID that the client chooses, this attack has no
   effect at all, since the correct information will be entered into the
   database.
