                  SSRC Group Based Simulcast Signaling
               draft-nandakumar-mmusic-rtcweb-grouping-00

Abstract

   In some applications it may be necessary to send multiple media
   encodings corresponding to a media source with in independent RTP
   media streams.  This is called Simulcast.  This document discusses a
   framework for describing simulcast media streams in SDP and also
   defines semantics to express relationship amongst them.  The
   semantics defined in this document are to be used with the source
   specific grouping framework defined in the [RFC5576]

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Capture Device: The physical source of stream of media data of one
   type such as camera or microphone.

   Media Source: A Media Source logically defines the source of a raw
   stream of media data as generated either by a single capture device
   or by a conceptual source.  A Media Source represents an Audio Source
   or a Video Source.

   Media Encoding: A particular encoding applied to the media data from
   a media source through the choice of sampling, bit-rate and other
   codec configuration parameters.

   Media Stream: Media from a Media Source is encoded and packetized to
   produce one or more Media Streams representing a sequence of RTP
   packets.

   RTP Source: Same as Media Stream.

   RTP Session: An RTP session is an association among a group of
   participants communicating with RTP.  It is a group communications
   channel which can potentially carry a number of Media Streams.
   Within an RTP session, every participant finds out meta-data and
   control information (over RTCP) about all the Media Streams in the

   RTP session.  The bandwidth of the RTCP control channel is shared
   within an RTP Session.

   Media Transport: A Media Transport defines an end-to-end transport
   association for carrying one or more RTP Sessions.  The combination
   of a network address and port uniquely identifies such a transport
   association, for example an IP address and a UDP port.

2.  Introduction

   Simulcast refers to taking media from a single media capture (e.g., a
   camera), and encoding it multiple times at different resolutions and
   / or frame rates.  For example, a device with a single HD camera may
   send one version of the video at full HD resolution, and a second
   version encoded at a low resolution.  This would allow a video
   conferencing bridge to be able to send the high resolution copy to
   some destination and low resolution copy to other destinations
   without having to recode the video at the conference bridge.

   [I-D.westerlund-avtcore-rtp-simulcast] describes different encodings
   of a media content to be combination of the following:

   o  Bit-rate: The difference is the amount of bits spent to encode the
      media thus giving different quality.

   o  Codec: Different media codecs are used to ensure that different
      receivers that do not have a common set of decoders can decode at
      least one of the versions.  This can include codec configuration
      options that are not compatible, like video encoder profiles, or
      the capability of receiving the transport packetization.

   o  Sampling: Different sampling of media, in spatial as well as in
      temporal domain, may be used to suit different rendering
      capabilities or needs at the receiving endpoints, as well as a
      method to achieve different bit-rates.  For video streams, spatial
      sampling affects image resolution and temporal sampling affects
      video frame rate.  For audio, spatial sampling relates to the
      number of audio channels and temporal sampling affects audio
      bandwidth.  Obviously, a difference in sampling may result in
      difference in bit-rate.

   In any application that needs to send multiple encodings, there is a
   potential need for simulcast.  The purpose of this document is to
   discuss suitable signaling solution in SDP for describing and
   negotiating simulcast streams, within the context of the Real Time
   Transport Protocol(RTP).

3.  Solution Overview

   The source-attribute specification [RFC5576] provides mechanisms
   describing Real-Time Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550]  sources, identified by
   their synchronization source (SSRC) identifier, in the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566], to associate attributes with
   these sources, and to express relationships among individual sources.

   To describe and negotiate simulcast streams with in SDP for a given
   media source, the following framework is been proposed:

   o  Each physical media source is represented by its own unique
      m-line.  This is a strict one-to-one mapping; a single media
      source device cannot be spread across several m-lines, nor may a
      single m-line represent multiple media sources.

   o  Each simulcast media stream is marked with an a=ssrc attribute to
      correlate it with its RTP Packets

   o  A new SSRC Grouping semantic is proposed to express the simulcast
      relationship between the media streams.

   o  In the absence of the above grouping semantic, multiple SSRCs in a
      single m-line are interpreted as alternate sources for the same
      media source.

   o  For multi-resolution simulcast, [RFC6236]  imageattr is proposed
      for a=ssrc attribute line, to specify send multiple resolutions,
      for example.

   o  For the receiver control of selecting the simulcast stream to
      receive, the mechanisms defined in
      [I-D.lennox-mmusic-sdp-source-selection] is proposed.

   o  When multicast topology is used to distribute RTP/RTCP packets,
      having same multicast address across all the m=lines is proposed
      when multiplexing framework such as BUNDLE
      [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation] is in operation.

   Providing explicit resolutions on a per-SSRC basis for SIMULCAST
   groupings allows an intermediary (such as a Media Translator
   [RFC5117]) to be able to select an appropriate SIMULCAST layer
   without inspecting the media stream, which could otherwise require
   decrypting and possibly partially decoding media packets.

   This document extends a=ssrc attribute [RFC5576] by introducing
   [RFC6236] imageattr enabling specification of multi-resolution
   simulcast streams for a given media source.

5.  The SIMUCAST ssrc-group attribute

   This document also extends [RFC5576] SSRC Grouping Framework
   semantics (a=ssrc-group) to indicate relationship between the
   simulcast media streams for a given media source.  A semantic called
   "SIMULCAST" is defined to achieve this purpose.

6.  SDP Examples

   The example SDP in Figure 1 shows simulcast encoding with the use of
   different codec-specific parameters using two different payload types
   for a camera source.  It also describes different resolutions for
   each encoded simulcast media stream.  The "SIMULCAST" SSRC grouping
   semantic is included to signal the relationship.

7.  Offer/Answer Consideration

   The Offer/Answer model for this specification adheres to the model as
   applicable to Source-Specific Media SDP attributes [RFC5576] and its
   extensions [I-D.lennox-mmusic-sdp-source-selection].

8.  Simulcast and Multiplexing

   Multiplexing in RTP can be achieved in several ways as listed:

      Payload Type based Multiplexing

      Media Stream Multiplexing based on SSRC in a Single RTP Session

      RTP Session Multiplexing over a single Media Transport.

   The proposed solution in this document assumes Media Stream
   Multiplexing to transport the simulcast encodings from several media
   sources with in a single RTP Session,whenever possible.  Such a
   solution can be envisioned by the usage of multiplexing frameworks,
   such as, BUNDLE [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation].  In the
   absence of such a framework, each media source gets its own RTP
   Session with its associated simulcast encodings multiplexed based on
   their respective SSRCs.

9.  Simulcast under Multicast RTP Topology

   [RFC5117] describes several underlying network topologies supported
   by RTP.  In this section the operation of the solution under
   multicast topologies is analyzed.

   The proposed solution enables right behavior for RTCP reporting
   across the members of the group, since all the sources and their
   simulcast streams form a single RTP Session under the BUNDLE
   multiplexing framework.

Internet-Draft            SSRC Group Simulcast                 July 2013


   In the scenarios where using a single 5-tuple for all the media
   sources is not possible, carrying each source with its simulcast
   encodings in its own RTP Session ensures correct behavior.

   Allowing media sources to send different simulcast encodings to
   different multicast group addresses is not directly enabled within
   the solution proposed.  Such a situation might arise to enable the
   receivers to selectively choose the multicast groups based on their
   receiving capabilities or interests.  However, the mechanisms defined
   in [I-D.lennox-mmusic-sdp-source-selection] enables receiver control
   to selectively choose the simulcast streams of interest.
