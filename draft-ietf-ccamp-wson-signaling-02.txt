     Signaling Extensions for Wavelength Switched Optical Networks
                 draft-ietf-ccamp-wson-signaling-02.txt

Abstract

   This memo provides extensions to Generalized Multi-Protocol Label
   Switching (GMPLS) signaling for control of wavelength switched
   optical networks (WSON).  Such extensions are necessary in WSONs
   under a number of conditions including: (a) when optional processing,
   such as regeneration, must be configured to occur at specific nodes
   along a path, (b) where equipment must be configured to accept an
   optical signal with specific attributes, or (c) where equipment must
   be configured to output an optical signal with specific attributes.
   In addition this memo provides mechanisms to support distributed
   wavelength assignment with bidirectional LSPs, and choice in
   distributed wavelength assignment algorithms. These extensions build
   on previous work for the control of lambda and G.709 based networks.

1. Introduction

   This memo provides extensions to Generalized Multi-Protocol Label
   Switching (GMPLS) signaling for control of wavelength switched
   optical networks (WSON).  Fundamental extensions are given to permit
   simultaneous bi-directional wavelength assignment while more advanced
   extensions are given to support the networks described in [RFC6163]
   which feature connections requiring configuration of input, output,
   and general signal processing capabilities at a node along a LSP

   These extensions build on previous work for the control of lambda and
   G.709 based networks.

   the optical signals for data transmission.



3. Requirements for WSON Signaling

   The following requirements for GMPLS based WSON signaling are in
   addition to the functionality already provided by existing GMPLS
   signaling mechanisms.

3.1. WSON Signal Characterization

   WSON signaling MUST convey sufficient information characterizing the
   signal to allow systems along the path to determine compatibility and
   perform any required local configuration. Examples of such systems
   include intermediate nodes (ROADMs, OXCs, Wavelength converters,
   Regenerators, OEO Switches, etc...), links (WDM systems) and end
   systems (detectors, demodulators, etc...). The details of any local
   configuration processes are out of the scope of this document.

   From [RFC6163] we have the following list of WSON signal
   characteristic information:

                    List 1. WSON Signal Characteristics


Bernstein et al.        Expires March 13, 2012                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        WSON Signaling Extensions          September 2011


  1. Optical tributary signal class (modulation format).
  2. FEC: whether forward error correction is used in the digital stream
     and what type of error correcting code is used
  3. Center frequency (wavelength)
  4. Bit rate
  5. G-PID: General Protocol Identifier for the information format

   The first three items on this list can change as a WSON signal
   traverses a network with regenerators, OEO switches, or wavelength
   converters. An ability to control wavelength conversion already
   exists in GMPLS signaling along with the ability to share client
   signal type information (G-PID). In addition, bit rate is a standard
   GMPLS signaling traffic parameter. It is referred to as Bandwidth
   Encoding in [RFC3471]. This leaves two new parameters: modulation
   format and FEC type, needed to fully characterize the optical signal.

3.2. Per LSP Network Element Processing Configuration

   In addition to configuring a network element (NE) along an LSP to
   input or output a signal with specific attributes, we may need to
   signal the NE to perform specific processing, such as 3R
   regeneration, on the signal at a particular NE.  In [RFC6163] we
   discussed three types of processing not currently covered by GMPLS:

     (A) Regeneration (possibly different types)

     (B) Fault and Performance Monitoring

     (C) Attribute Conversion

   The extensions here MUST provide for the configuration of these types
   of processing at nodes along an LSP.



3.3. Bi-Directional Distributed Wavelength Assignment

   WSON signaling MAY support distributed wavelength assignment
   consistent with the wavelength continuity constraint for bi-
   directional connections. The following cases MAY be separately
   supported:

   (a)Where the same wavelength is used for both upstream and downstream
        directions

Internet-Draft        WSON Signaling Extensions          September 2011


   (b)Where different wavelengths can be used for both upstream and
        downstream directions.

3.4. Distributed Wavelength Assignment Support

   As discussed in [HZang00] and [Sambo11] different computational
   approaches for distributed wavelength assignment are available. Hence
   it may be advantageous to allow the specification of a particular
   approach when more than one mechanism is implemented in the systems
   along the path.

   WSON signaling MAY support the selection of a specific distributed
   wavelength assignment method.

3.5. Out of Scope

   This draft does not address signaling information related to optical
   impairments.

4. WSON Signal Traffic Parameters, Attributes and Processing

   As discussed in [RFC6163] single channel optical signals used in
   WSONs are called "optical tributary signals" and come in a number of
   classes characterized by modulation format and bit rate. Although
   WSONs are fairly transparent to the signals they carry, to ensure
   compatibility amongst various networks devices and end systems it can
   be important to include key lightpath characteristics as traffic
   parameters in signaling [RFC6163].

4.1. Traffic Parameters for Optical Tributary Signals

   In [RFC3471] we see that the G-PID (client signal type) and bit rate
   (byte rate) of the signals are defined as parameters and in [RFC3473]
   they are conveyed Generalized Label Request object and the RSVP
   SENDER_TSPEC/FLOWSPEC objects respectively.



4.2. Signal Attributes and Processing

   Section 3.2. gave the requirements for signaling to indicate to a
   particular NE along an LSP what type of processing to perform on an
   optical signal or how to configure that NE to accept or transmit an
   optical signal with particular attributes.

   One way of accomplishing this is via a new EXPLICIT_ROUTE subobject.
   Reference [RFC3209] defines the EXPLICIT_ROUTE object (ERO) and a

Internet-Draft        WSON Signaling Extensions          September 2011


   number of subobjects, while reference [RFC5420] defines general
   mechanisms for dealing with additional LSP attributes. Although
   reference [RFC5420] defines a RECORD_ROUTE object (RRO) attributes
   subobject, it does not define an ERO subobject for LSP attributes.

   Regardless of the exact coding for the ERO subobject conveying the
   input, output, or processing instructions. This new "processing"
   subobject would follow a subobject containing the IP address, or the
   interface identifier [RFC3477], associated with the link on which it
   is to be used along with any label subobjects [RFC3473].

   The contents of this new "processing" subobject would be a list of
   TLVs that could include:

   o  Modulation Type TLV (input and/or output)

   o  FEC Type TLV (input and/or output)

   o  Processing Instruction TLV

   Currently the only processing instruction TLV currently defined is
   for regeneration. The [WSON-Info] and [WSON-Encode] provides the
   details for these specifics sub-TLVs.

   Possible encodings and values for these TLV are given in below.

4.2.1. Modulation Type sub-TLV

   The encoding for modulation type sub-TLV is defined in [WSON-Encode]
   Section 4.2.1.

   It may come in two different formats: a standard modulation field or
   a vendor specific modulation field. Both start with the same 32 bit
   header shown below.

      0                   1                   2                   3

   Where S bit set to 1 indicates a standardized modulation format and S
   bit set to 0 indicates a vendor specific modulation format. The
   length is the length in bytes of the entire modulation type field.

   Where I bit set to 1 indicates an input modulation format and where I
   bit set to 0 indicates an output modulation format. Note that the
   source modulation type is implied when I bit is set to 0 and that the
   sink modulation type is implied when I bit is set to 1. For signaling
   purposes only the output form (I=0) is needed.

   The format for the standardized type is given by:

   in their characterization.

   The encoding for FEC Type TLV is defined in [WSON-Encode] Section
   4.3.1.

   It indicates the FEC type output at particular node along the LSP.
   The FEC type sub-TLV comes in two different types: a standard FEC

5. Bidirectional Lightpath Setup

   With the wavelength continuity constraint in CI-incapable [RFC3471]
   WSONs, where the nodes in the networks cannot support wavelength
   conversion, the same wavelength on each link along a unidirectional
   lightpath should be reserved. In addition to the wavelength
   continuity constraint, requirement 3.2 gives us another constraint on
   wavelength usage in data plane, in particular, it requires the same
   wavelength to be used in both directions. [RFC6163] in section 6.1
   reports on the implication to GMPLS signaling related to both bi-
   directionality and Distributed Wavelengths Assignment.

5.1. Possible Solutions for Bidirectional Lightpath

   A first classification is using a unique bidirectional LSP (as
   defined by [RFC3471]) two unidirectional LSPs as per [RFC2205]
   approach, so possible options are the following:

      o  Bidirectional LSP

           1.  Current [RFC3471], [RFC3473] co-routed approach. The
             label distribution is based on Label_Set and
             Upstream_Label objects. In case of specific constraints
             such as the same wavelengths in both directions, it may
             require several signaling attempts using information from
             the Acceptable_Label_Set received from path error
             messages.

           2.  Using a specific LSP_ATTRIBUTE or a newly defined
             Upstream_Label_Set object. This mechanism seems to be more
             efficient (i.e. one signaling attempt) in case of
             distributed wavelength assignment and same wavelength in
             both directions.

      o  Two Unidirectional LSPs. This solution has been always
        available as per [RFC3209] however recent work introduces the
        association concept [RFC4872] and [ASSOC-Info]. Recent
        transport evolutions [ASSOC-ext] provide a way to associate two
        unidirectional LSPs as a bidirectional LSP. In line with this,
        a small extension can make this approach work for the WSON
        case.

5.2. Bidirectional Lightpath Signaling Procedure

   [TO BE UPDATED ACCORDING TO THE BIDIRECTIONAL METHOD CHOOSEN FOR WSON
   either new objects or assoc ]

   Considering the system configuration mentioned above, it is needed to
   add a new function into RSVP-TE to support bidirectional lightpath
   with same wavelength on both directions.

   The lightpath setup procedure is described below:

   1. Ingress node adds the new type lightpath indication in an
      LSP_ATTRIBUTES object.  It is propagated in the Path message in
      the same way as that of a Label Set object for downstream;

   2. On reception of a Path message containing both the new type
      lightpath indication in an LSP_ATTRIBUTES object and Label Set
      object, the receiver of message along the path checks the local
      LSP database to see if the Label Set TLVs are acceptable on both
      directions jointly.  If there are acceptable wavelengths, then
      copy the values of them into new Label Set TLVs, and forward the
      Path message to the downstream node.  Otherwise the Path message
      will be terminated, and a PathErr message with a "Routing
      problem/Label Set" indication will be generated;

   3. On reception of a Path message containing both such a new type
      lightpath indication in an LSP_ATTRIBUTES object and an Upstream
      Label object, the receiver MUST terminate the Path message using
      a PathErr message with Error Code "Unknown Attributes TLV" and
      Error Value set to the value of the new type lightpath TLV type
      code;

   4. On reception of a Path message containing both the new type
      lightpath indication in an LSP_ATTRIBUTES object and Label Set
      object, the egress node verifies whether the Label Set TLVs are
      acceptable, if one or more wavelengths are available on both
      directions, then any one available wavelength could be selected.
      A Resv message is generated and propagated to upstream node;

   5. When a Resv message is received at an intermediate node, if it is
      a new type lightpath, the intermediate node allocates the label
      to interfaces on both directions and update internal database for
      this bidirectional same wavelength lightpath, then configures the
      local ROADM or OXC on both directions.

   Except the procedure related to Label Set object, the other processes
   will be left untouched.

Internet-Draft        WSON Signaling Extensions          September 2011




5.3. Backward Compatibility Considerations

   Due to the introduction of new processing on Label Set object, it is
   required that each node in the lightpath is able to recognize the new
   type lightpath indication Flag carried by an LSP_ATTRIBUTES object,
   and deal with the new Label Set operation correctly.  It is noted
   that this new extension is not backward compatible.

   According to the descriptions in [RFC5420], an LSR that does not
   recognize a TLV type code carried in this object MUST reject the Path
   message using a PathErr message with Error Code "Unknown Attributes
   TLV" and Error Value set to the value of the Attributes Flags TLV
   type code.

   An LSR that does not recognize a bit set in the Attributes Flags TLV
   MUST reject the Path message using a PathErr message with Error Code
   "Unknown Attributes Bit" and Error Value set to the bit number of the
   new type lightpath Flag in the Attributes Flags. The reader is
   referred to the detailed backward compatibility considerations
   expressed in [RFC5420].



6. RWA Related

6.1. Wavelength Assignment Method Selection

   Routing + Distributed wavelength assignment (R+DWA) is one of the
   options defined by the [RFC6163]. The output from the routing
   function will be a path but the wavelength will be selected on a hop-
   by-hop basis.

   Under this hypothesis the node initiating the signaling process needs
   to declare its own wavelength availability (through a label_set
   object). Each intermediate node may delete some labels due to
   connectivity constraints or its own assignment policy. At the end,
   the destination node has to make the final decision on the wavelength
   assignment among the ones received through the signaling process.

   As discussed in [HZang00] and [Sambo11] a number of different
   wavelength assignment algorithms maybe employed. In addition as
   discussed in [RFC6163] the wavelength assignment can be either for a
   unidirectional lightpath or for a bidirectional lightpath constrained
   to use the same lambda in both directions.

Internet-Draft        WSON Signaling Extensions          September 2011


   A simple TLV could be used to indication wavelength assignment
   directionality and wavelength assignment method. This would be placed
   in an LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object per [RFC5420]. The use of a TLV
   in the LSP required attributes object was pointed out in [Xu].

   [TO DO: The directionality stuff needs to be reconciled with the
   earlier material]

   Unique Wavelength: 0 same wavelength in both directions, 1 may use
   different wavelengths [TBD: shall we use only 1 bit]

   Wavelength Assignment Method: 0 unspecified (any), 1 First-Fit, 2
   Random, 3 Least-Loaded (multi-fiber).  Others TBD.

7. Security Considerations

   This document has no requirement for a change to the security models
   within GMPLS and associated protocols. That is the OSPF-TE, RSVP-TE,
   and PCEP security models could be operated unchanged.

   However satisfying the requirements for RWA using the existing
   protocols may significantly affect the loading of those protocols.
   This makes the operation of the network more vulnerable to denial of
   service attacks. Therefore additional care maybe required to ensure
   that the protocols are secure in the WSON environment.

   Furthermore the additional information distributed in order to
   address the RWA problem represents a disclosure of network
   capabilities that an operator may wish to keep private. Consideration
   should be given to securing this information.

   things and modulation types, modulation parameters, wavelength
   assignment methods, etc...
