1.  Introduction and Scope

   This document provides non-normative guidance to aid in the
   understanding of collaboration on standards development between
   Project 802 of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
   (IEEE) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) of the Internet
   Society (ISOC).  Early identification of topics of mutual interest
   will allow for constructive efforts between the two organizations
   based on mutual respect.

   EDITOR'S NOTE: This version of the draft is very rough, and is being
   submitted so we have something concrete to talk about.

2.  Guidance on Collaboration

   This section describes how the existing processes within the IETF and
   IEEE 802 may be utilized to enable collaboration between the
   organizations.

2.1.  Organization, Participation and Membership

   IEEE 802 and IETF are similar in some ways, but different in others.
   When working on project that's of interest to both organizations,
   it's important to understand these differences.

2.1.1.  IEEE 802 Organization, Participation and Membership

   Standardization in IEEE 802 takes place within Working Groups
   operating under an Executive Committee.  Most Working Groups have one
   or more Task Groups.  A Task Group is responsible for a project or
   group of projects.  The IEEE 802 Executive Committee and Working
   Groups meet at plenary sessions in March, July and November.  Most
   Working Groups hold interim meetings, usually in January, April and
   September.  An IEEE 802 Orientation for new participants that gives
   an overview of IEEE 802 process is available.

   A good place to to learn more is the IEEE 802 Home Page: [1]

   Participation in IEEE 802 Working Groups is by individual and is
   open.  Individuals are required to declare their affiliation.
   Working Groups maintain membership rosters, with voting membership
   attained and retained on the basis of in-person meeting attendance.

   EDITOR'S NOTE: Do we need to explain "affiliation"?  An individual is
   deemed "affiliated" with any individual or entity that has been, or
   will be, financially or materially supporting that individual's
   participation in a particular IEEE standards activity.  This
   includes, but is not limited to, his or her employer and any
   individual or entity that has or will have, either directly or
   indirectly, requested, paid for, or otherwise sponsored his or her
   participation.

2.1.2.  IETF Organization, Participation and Membership

   In the IETF, work is done in working groups (WGs), mostly through
   open, public mailing lists rather than face-to-face meetings.  WGs
   are organized into areas, each area being managed by two co-area
   directors.  Collectively, the area directors comprise the Internet
   Engineering Steering Group (IESG).

   Participation in the IETF is open to anyone (technically, anyone with



Dawkins                  Expires April 18, 2013                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      The IEEE 802 / IETF Relationship        October 2012


   access to e-mail sufficient to allow subscription to one or more IETF
   mailing lists).  All IETF participants act as individuals.  There are
   a small number of IETF procedures that recognize organizations that
   may sponsor IETF participants, but these are organizational and do
   not apply to the standard specification process itself.  There is no
   concept of "IETF membership".

   A good place to to learn more is the IETF Home Page: [2]

   To foster ongoing communication between IEEE 802 and IETF, it is
   important to identify and establish contact points within each
   organization.  Contact points on the IETF side may include:

   IETF Area Director:  An IETF area director is the individual
             responsible for overseeing a major focus of activity (an
             "Area").  These positions are relatively long- term (of
             several years) and offer the stability of contact points
             between the two organizations for a given topic.

   IETF Working Group Chair:  An IETF working group chair is an
             individual who is assigned to lead the work on a specific
             task within one particular area.  These positions are
             working positions (of a year or more) that typically end
             when the work on a specific topic ends.  Collaboration here
             is very beneficial to ensure the actual work gets done.

   Other Contact Points:  It may be beneficial to establish additional
             contact points for specific topics of mutual interest.
             These contact points should be established early in the
             work effort, and in some cases the contact point identified
             by each organization may be the same individual.

   Note: The current list of IETF area directors and working group
   chairs can be found in the IETF working group charters.

2.2.  Exchange of information about new Work Items

   The following sections outline a process that can be used to enable
   each group to be informed about the other's active and proposed new
   work items.

2.2.1.  How IEEE 802 is informed about active IETF work items

   The responsibility is on individual IEEE 802 working groups to review
   the current IETF working groups to determine if there are any topics
   of mutual interest.  Working group charters and active Internet-
   Drafts can be found on the IETF web site
   (http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/).  If an IEEE 802 working group



Dawkins                  Expires April 18, 2013                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      The IEEE 802 / IETF Relationship        October 2012


   identifies a common area of work, the IEEE 802 working group
   leadership should contact both the IETF working group chair and the
   area director(s) responsible.  This may be accompanied by a formal
   liaison statement (see Section X.X).

2.2.2.  How IETF is informed about active IEEE 802 work items

   IEEE Working Group status reports are published at the beginning and
   end of each plenary at on the IEEE802 website: [3].  Each Working
   Group includes a list of their active projects and the status.  The
   charter of an IEEE 802 project is defined in an approved Project
   Authorization Request (PAR).  PARs are accessible in IEEE Standards
   myProject: [4].  Access requires an IEEE web account which is free
   and has no membership requirement.  In myProject, a search on "View
   Active PARs" for 802 will bring up a list of all active IEEE 802
   PARs.  If an IETF working group identifies a common area of work or a
   need for coordination, the working group leadership should contact
   the IEEE 802 Working Group chair and Task Group chair.  This may be
   accompanied by a formal liaison statement (see Section xx).

2.2.3.  How IEEE 802 is informed about proposed new IETF work items

   The IETF maintains a mailing list for the distribution of proposed
   new work items among standards development organizations.  Many such
   items can be identified in proposed Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF)
   sessions, as well as draft charters for working groups.  The IETF
   forwards all such draft charters for all new and revised working
   groups and BOF session announcements to the IETF new-work mailing
   list.  An IEEE 802 mailing list is subscribed to this list.
   Leadership of the IEEE working groups may subscribe to this IEEE 802
   mailing list, which is maintained by the Executive Committee (EC).
   Each IEEE 802 Working Group will delegate at least one expert to
   subscribe to this list and be ready to dispatch any information
   relevant for their activity.  This will enable the IEEE 802 working
   groups to monitor the new work items for possible overlap or interest
   to their IEEE 802 working group.  It is expected that this mailing
   list will see a few messages per month.

   Each IEEE 802 working group chairman, or designated representative,
   may provide comments on these charters by responding to the IESG
   mailing list at iesg@ietf.org clearly indicating their IEEE 802
   position and the nature of their concern.  Plain-text email is
   preferred on the IESG mailing list.

   It should be noted that the IETF turnaround time for new working
   group charters can be as short as two weeks.  As a result, the
   mailing list should be consistently monitored.

Internet-Draft      The IEEE 802 / IETF Relationship        October 2012


2.2.4.  How IETF is informed about proposed new IEEE 802 work items

   An IEEE project is initiated by approval of a Project Authorization
   Request (PAR) which includes a description of the scope of the work.
   Any IEEE 802 PARs which introduce new functionality are required to
   be available for review no less than 30 days prior to the Monday of
   the IEEE 802 plenary session where they will be considered.

   IEEE considers Five Criteria when deciding whether to approve new
   work: Broad Market Potential, Compatibility, Distinct Identity and
   Technical Feasibility.  The criteria are defined in the IEEE 802 LAN/
   MAN Standards Committee (LMSC) Operations Manual.  The PARs are
   accompanied by responses on the 5 Criteria.

   Any comments on proposed PARs should be submitted to the Working
   Group chair and copied to the Executive Committee chair by e-mail not
   later than 5:00 PM Tuesday of the plenary session (in the time zone
   where the plenary is located).

2.3.  Document Access

   During the course of IEEE 802 and IETF collaboration, it is important
   to share internal documents among the technical working groups.  In
   addition, draft standards, Internet Drafts, and RFCs may also be
   distributed.

2.3.1.  IEEE 802 Documentation System

   Each IEEE 802 standardization project is assigned to a Working Group
   (WG) for development.  In IEEE 802, the working methods of the WGs
   vary in detail.  The documentation system is one area in which WG
   operations differ, based on varying needs and traditions.  In some
   cases, the WGs assign the core development to a subgroup (typically
   known as a Task Group or Task Force), and the documentation
   procedures may vary among he subgroups as well.  Prior to project
   authorization, or on topics not directly related to development of a
   standard, the WG may consider and develop documents itself, or using
   other subgroups (standing committees, ad hocs, etc.).  IEEE 802 also
   supports Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs) that conduct business and
   develop documents, although not standards.  References here to WGs
   apply to TAGs as well.

2.3.1.1.  IEEE 802 Documentation System

   In general, development of standards is IEEE 802 is contribution-
   driven.  Content toward draft standards is submitted to WGs by
   individual participants, or groups of participants.  Content toward
   other group documents (such as, for example, external communication

Internet-Draft      The IEEE 802 / IETF Relationship        October 2012


   statements or foundation documents underlying a draft standard) might
   also be contribution-driven.  At some point, the group assembles
   contributed material to develop group documents, and revision takes
   place within group meetings or by assignment to editors.  For the
   most part, the contributions toward discussion as well as the group
   documents (including minutes and other reports) are openly available
   to the public.

2.3.1.2.  Access to internal IEEE 802 Working Group Documents

   In general, development of standards is IEEE 802 is contribution-
   driven.  Content toward draft standards is submitted to WGs by
   individual participants, or groups of participants.  Content toward
   other group documents (such as, for example, external communication
   statements or foundation documents underlying a draft standard) might
   also be contribution-driven.  At some point, the group assembles
   contributed material to develop group documents, and revision takes
   place within group meetings or by assignment to editors.  For the
   most part, the contributions toward discussion as well as the group
   documents (including minutes and other reports) are openly available
   to the public.

   Many IEEE 802 groups use a documentation system provided by IEEE and
   known as "Mentor".  The list of these groups is available at IEEE 802
   Mentor Home Page: [5].  Mentor has some particularly notable aspects:

   1.  The documentation system is structured and ordered, with
       documentation tags and unique numbering and revisioning.

   2.  On-line documentation is available.

   3.  Generally speaking, the archives are publicly and freely
       available.

   4.  Limited search functionality is provided, and publicly-available
       search engines index the data.

   5.  The ability to submit documents to Mentor is limited but is
       generally available to any interested party.  An IEEE Account is
       required but can be easily and freely established IEEE Account
       Request: [6].  If submission is protected, the privilege can be
       requested via the Mentor system (using the "Join group" link on
       each WG Mentor page) and would typically be granted by the WG
       documentation manager in a manual approval.

   6.  Submitted documents are immediately available to the general
       public at the same instant they become available for
       consideration by the group.



Dawkins                  Expires April 18, 2013                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft      The IEEE 802 / IETF Relationship        October 2012


   In most cases, WGs that use the Mentor system use it exclusively, so
   that any substantive document will be available through the system.
   In a few cases (for example, the IEEE 802 Executive Committee),
   document distribution is by multiple means (including an email
   reflector), so it may be difficult to compile a complete set of
   documents.

   Some WGs do not use the Mentor system.  In this case, documents are
   nevertheless generally publically available and indexed.  Typically,
   the index may be presented via a human-managed web site.  In such
   cases, the contributions may be submitted via email to a document
   manager, so they may not be immediately available to the public.  For
   WGs not using the Mentor system, it should be relatively
   straightforward to find documents of interest by reviewing the
   group's main web page, at IEEE 802 working group pages: [7], where
   [i] is the one-digit or two-digit numerical desigation for the WG or
   TAG.  In some cases, links to documents may be available only by
   reviewing the WG or subgroup meeting minutes.

2.3.1.3.  Submission of Contributions to IEEE 802 Working Groups

   IEEE 802 Working Groups are open to contribution.  In many cases, a
   WG or subgroup will issue a call for contributions with a specific
   technical solicitation, including deadlines and submission
   instructions.  Some groups maintain specific submission procedures
   and specify a contribution cover sheet to clarify the status of the
   contribution.

2.3.1.4.  Access to IEEE 802 Working Group Drafts

   The IEEE owns the copyright to draft standards developed within IEEE
   standardization projects.  As a result, such drafts are never made
   publicly available.  The IEEE-SA grants permission for an IEEE draft
   standard to be distributed without charge to the participants for
   that IEEE standards development project.  Typically, such
   distribution is on the Internet under password protection, with the
   password provided to the members of the participating WG.  Requests
   to the relevent WG chair for access to a draft for purposes of
   participation in the project are typically granted.  In some cases,
   under an organizational agreement, the IEEE-SA allows for ready
   document exchange with other entities.  No such agreement currently
   exists to cover exchanges between IEEE-SA and IETF.

2.3.1.5.  Access to IEEE 802 Standards

   IEEE standards, once approved, are published and made available for
   sale.  They can be purchased from the IEEE Standards Store: [8].
   They are also available from other outlets, including the IEEE Xplore

   digital library: [9] .  The Get IEEE 802 program: [10] grants public
   access to download individual IEEE 802 standards at no charge.  IEEE
   802 standards are added to the Get IEEE 802 program six months after
   publication.

2.3.2.  Access to IETF Documents

   Internet-Drafts are available on the IETF web site.  IEEE 802 can
   make selected IEEE 802 documents at any stage of development
   available to the IETF by attaching them to a formal liaison
   statement.  Although a communication can point to a URL where a non-
   ASCII document (e.g., Word) can be downloaded, attachments in
   proprietary formats to an IETF mailing list are discouraged.  It
   should also be recognized that the official versions of all IETF
   documents are in ASCII.

2.4.  Participation in Document Review and Approval

   During the course of IEEE 802 and IETF collaboration, it is important
   for technical experts to review documents of mutual interest and,
   when appropriate, to provide review comments to the approving body as
   the document moves through the approval process.

2.4.2.  IETF balloting processes and opportunities for IEEE 802
        participation

   Technical contributions are welcome at any point in the IETF document
   review and approval process, but there are some points where
   contribution is more likely to be effective.

   1.  When a working group is considering adoption of an individual
       draft.  Adoption is often signaled on the working group's mailing
       list.

   2.  When a working group issues a "Working Group Last Call" ("WGLC")
       for a draft.  Although this is not a mandatory step in the
       document review and approval process, most IETF working groups do
       issue WGLCs for most working group documents.  WGLC would be
       signaled on the working group's mailing list.

   3.  When the Internet Engineering Steering Group issues an "IETF Last
       Call" ("Last Call") for a draft.  This is similar in spirit to
       WGLC, but is a request for review and approval that is addressed

       to the larger IETF community.  IETF Last Call is signaled on the
       IETF-Announce Mailing List, and comments and feedback are
       ordinarily directed to the IETF Discussion Mailing List.

2.5.  Expert Review Processes

   With the areas of cooperation between IEEE 802 and IETF increasing,
   the document review process has extended beyond the traditional
   subjects of SNMP MIBs and AAA.  For example, as part of the IETF
   CAPWAP WG charter, IEEE 802.11 was asked to review the CAPWAP
   Taxonomy Document [RFC4118]; Dorothy Stanley organized an ad hoc
   group for this purpose.  IEEE 802.11 has also reviewed [IDSEL] and
   [IABLINK].  Within IETF, IEEE 802 comments are resolved using normal
   WG and IETF processes.

   IETF participants can comment as part of the IEEE 802 ballot process,
   regardless of their voting status within IEEE 802.  Comments must be
   composed in the format specified for the ballot, and submitted by the
   ballot deadline.

2.6.  Liaison Officials and Liaison Statements

   Both IEEE 802 and IETF work best when people participate directly in
   work of mutual interest, but that's not always possible, and
   individuals speaking as individuals may not provide effective
   communication between the two SDOs.  From time to time, it may be
   appropriate for a technical body in one SDO to communicate as a body
   with a technical body in the other SDO.  This section describes the
   mechanisms used to provide formal communication between the two
   organizations, should that become necessary.

3.  Mailing Lists

   EDITOR NOTE: This section is hacked out of RFC 6756, so needs IEEE-
   side attention.

   All IETF working groups and all ITU-T study group Questions have
   associated mailing lists.

   In the IETF, the mailing list is the primary vehicle for discussion
   and decision-making.  It is recommended that the ITU-T experts
   interested in particular IETF working group topics subscribe to and
   participate in these lists.  IETF WG mailing lists are open to all
   subscribers.  The IETF working group mailing list subscription and
   archive information are noted in each working group's charter.  In
   the ITU-T, the TSB has set up formal mailing lists for Questions,
   working parties, and other topics within study groups (more detail
   can be found on the ITU-T web site).  These mailing lists are
   typically used for ITU-T correspondence, including technical
   discussion, meeting logistics, reports, etc.

   IETF participants may subscribe to ITU-T focus group email lists if
   they are individuals from a country that is a member of ITU-T.

4.  Cross-Referencing

   Need text here.

   EDITOR NOTE: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6756#section-2.6 is
   primarily from the ITU-T side; I don't think IETF requires anything
   special (except document availability and stability) to reference
   documents from another SDO, so I don't think IETF needs to say
   anything here.

5.  Protocol Parameter Allocation

   Both IEEE 802 and IETF maintain registries of assigned protocol
   parameters, and some protocol parameters assigned in one organization
   are of interest to the other organization.  This section describes
   the way each organization registers protocol parameters.

5.1.  IANA

   The IETF uses the Internet Assigned Numbering Authority (IANA) as a
   registry for protocol parameter allocation.  The overarching document
   describing this is RFC 5226.  RFC 5342 discusses use of IEEE 802-
   specific IANA parameters in IETF protocols and specifies IANA
   considerations for allocation of code points under the IANA OUI
   (Organizationally Unique Identifier).

5.2.  IEEE Registration Authority

   EDITOR'S NOTE: This section is on one (important) specific example -
   do we need text that describes general operation first?

   EtherType Allocation - The EtherType field is very limited, so that
   allocations are made solely on an "as needed" basis.  For related
   uses, a single EtherType should be requested, with additional fields
   serving as sub-protocol identifiers, rather than applying for
   multiple EtherTypes.  EtherType allocation policy is described in
   [TYPE-TUT].

   While a fee is normally charged by IEEE 802 for the allocation of an
   EtherType, IEEE 802 will consider waiving the fee for allocations
   relating to an IETF standards track document, based on a request from
   the IESG.

5.3.  IEEE Registration at IEEE working group level

   Need text here.

5.4.  Pointers to Additional Useful Information

   This section provides pointers to additional useful information for
   paricipants in IEEE 802 and IETF.

7.  Security Considerations

   Documents that describe cooperation procedures, like this one does,
   have no direct Internet security implications.

   EDITOR NOTE: This text was taken from RFC 6756, and it's probably
   defensible.  RFC 4441 called out a lot of specifics (the need for
   security review when working with RADIUS, EAP, etc.).  We could do
   the same here, if we had to, and if someone provided text.

B.1.  MIB Review

   Historically the MIB modules for IEEE 802.1 and IEEE 802.3 were
   developped in the IETF Bridge MIB and Hub MIB Working Groups
   respectively.  With travel budgets under pressure, it has become
   increasingly difficult for companies to fund employees to attend both
   IEEE 802 and IETF meetings.  As a result, an alternative was found to
   past arrangements that involved chartering MIB work items within an
   IETF WG by transferring the work to IEEE 802 with expert support for
   MIB review from the IETF.  In order to encourage wider review of MIBs
   developed by IEEE 802 WGs, it is recommended that MIB modules
   developed in IEEE 802 follow the MIB guidelines [RFC4181].  An IEEE
   802 group may request assignment of a 'MIB Doctor' to assist in a MIB
   review by contacting the IETF Operations and Management Area
   Director.

   By standardizing IEEE 802 MIBs only within IEEE 802 while utilizing
   the SNMP quality control process, the IETF and IEEE 802 seek to
   ensure quality while decreasing overhead.  The process of transfer of
   the MIB work from the IETF to IEEE 802 is documented in [RFC4663] and
   in [I-D ETHERNET-MIB-TRANSFER].
