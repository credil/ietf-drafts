                   RPKI Router Implementation Report
                    draft-ietf-sidr-rpki-rtr-impl-04

Abstract

   This document is an implementation report for the RPKI Router
   protocol as defined in [RFC6810].  The editor did not verify the
   accuracy of the information provided by respondents.  The respondents
   are experts with the implementations they reported on, and their
   responses are considered authoritative for the implementations for
   which their responses represent.  Respondents were asked to only use
   the YES answer if the feature had at least been tested in the lab.

1.  Introduction

   In order to formally validate the origin Autonomous Systems (ASs) of
   BGP announcements, routers need a simple but reliable mechanism to
   receive Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) [RFC6810] prefix
   origin data from a trusted cache.  The RPKI Router protocol defined
   in [RFC6810] provides a mechanism to deliver validated prefix origin
   data to routers.

Internet-Draft     RPKI Router Implementation Report        October 2013


   This document provides an implementation report for the RPKI Router
   protocol as defined in RFC 6810 [RFC6810].

   The editor did not verify the accuracy of the information provided by
   respondents or by any alternative means.  The respondents are experts
   with the implementations they reported on, and their responses are
   considered authoritative for the implementations for which their
   responses represent.  Respondents were asked to only use the YES
   answer if the feature had at least been tested in the lab.

   1) YES, but... fatal, so connection is dropped, but cache does not
   conclude it's inconsistent.

10.  Interoperable Implementations

   List other implementations that you have tested interoperability of
   RPKI Router Implementation.

10.1.  Cisco Implementation

   Cisco: The Cisco IOS and IOS-XR implementation should be
   interoperable with other vendor RPKI Router Protocol implementations.
   In particular we have tested our interoperability with rpki.net's
   RPKI Router implementation.

10.2.  Juniper Implementation

   Juniper: The Juniper Networks, Inc.  JUNOS implementation should be
   interoperable with other vendor RPKI Router Protocol implementations.
   In particular we have tested our interoperability with rpki.net's and
   NCCs RPKI Router Cache implementation.

10.3.  rpki.net Implementation

   rpki.net: The rpki.net implementation should operate with other rpki-
   rtr implementations.  In particular, we have tested our rpki-rtr
   server's interoperability with Cisco IOS, Cisco IOS-XR, and Juniper.

10.4.  RIPE NCC Implementation

   RIPE NCC: The RIPE NCC validator has been tested by us with other
   rpki-rtr implementations.  In particular we have tested with RTRLib
   and CISCO IOS.  We received positive feedback from close contacts
   testing our validator with JUNOS and Quagga.

10.5.  RTRlib Implementation

   RTRlib: The RTRlib has been tested by us with other rpki-rtr
   implementations.  In particular, we have tested with rtr-origin from
   rpki.net and RIPE NCC Validator.

10.6.  BBN RPSTIR Implementation

   BBN RPSTIR: We have not yet tested with any other implementations.

11.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.
