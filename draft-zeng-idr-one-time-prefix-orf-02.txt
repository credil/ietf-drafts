     One-time Address-Prefix Based Outbound Route Filter for BGP-4
                 draft-zeng-idr-one-time-prefix-orf-02

Abstract

   This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter (ORF) type for
   BGP, termed "One-time Address Prefix Outbound Route Filter", which
   would allow a BGP speaker to send to its BGP peer a route refresh
   request with a set of address-prefix-based filters to make the peer
   re-advertise only the specific routes matching the filters to the
   speaker.  This ORF-type enables a BGP speaker to replay or recover
   some specific "problematic" routes without requiring its peer to re-
   advertise the whole Adj-RIB-Out of a specific address family, which
   makes the trouble shooting operation (such as packets tracking) more
   efficient and reduces the impact on network stability.  This filter
   does not change the outbound route filters on BGP peers and should
   only be used for one-time filtering.

Internet-Draft      One-time Address-Prefix Based ORF          July 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Outbound Route Filtering Capability defined in [RFC5291] provides
   a mechanism for a BGP speaker to send to its BGP peer a set of
   Outbound Route Filters (ORFs) that can be used by its peer to filter
   its outbound routing updates to the speaker.

   During some network maintenance, BGP speaker only needs to retrieve
   some specific "problematic" routes from its peer if the routes are
   possibly lost or contain some problematic attributes for some reason,
   but send ROUTE-REFRESH will lead to the peer re-advertising its whole
   Adj-RIB-Out.  Such large numbers of updates include a lot of
   unnecessary routes which would make trouble shooting operation (such
   as packets tracking) more difficult, and is a waste of processing
   resources and bandwidth.  With the increase of IPV6 deployment, this
   problem could be more significant.  Even configured with ORF
   mechanism as defined in [RFC5291], on receipt of a ROUTE-REFRESH
   message, the peer will re-advertise all the routes matching current
   outbound route filters, i.e., the whole Adj-Rib-Out for this BGP
   speaker.  Since in this case the BGP speaker does not want to change
   the outbound route filters on its peer, this problem cannot be solved
   by current ORF mechanism.

   This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter (ORF) type for
   BGP, termed "One-time Address Prefix Outbound Route Filter", which
   would allow a BGP speaker to send to its BGP peer a route refresh
   request with a set of address-prefix-based filters to make the peer
   re-advertise only the specific routes matching the filters to the
   speaker.  This ORF-type enables a BGP speaker to replay or recover
   some specific "problematic" routes without requiring its peer to re-
   advertise the whole Adj-RIB-Out of specific address family, which
   makes the trouble shooting operation (such as packets tracking) more
   efficient and reduces the impact on network stability.  This filter
   does not change the outbound route filters on BGP peers and should
   only be used for one-time filtering.

   Consider the following scenario: In an Inter-AS environment, if
   ASBR-A received a malformed UPDATE from ASBR-B and treated it as
   withdraw.  For Operator-A, the log on the ASBR-A was not enough to
   judge whether the UPDATE was incorrectly sent by ASBR-B or
   incorrectly processed by ASBR-A.  A good method is to replay and
   debug the packets.  One-time Prefix ORF is a low impact way to
   refresh the UPDATE.


2.  One-time Address Prefix ORF-Type

   This document defines a new ORF type: One-time Address Prefix ORF.

Internet-Draft      One-time Address-Prefix Based ORF          July 2012


   In the following description, the sending speaker sends a one-time
   ORF request and the receiving speaker receives it and sends back the
   routes to satisfy the request.

   As specified in the [RFC5291], an ORF entry is a tuple of the form
   <AFI/SAFI, ORF-Type, Action, Match, ORF-value> an ORF consists of one
   or more ORF entries that have a common AFI/SAFI and ORF-Type.  An ORF
   is identified by <AFI/SAFI, ORF-Type>.

   The format of One-time Address Prefix ORF-Type entry is the same as
   the encoding of Address Prefix ORF in [RFC5292], the specific fields
   are defined as follows:

   Since the semantics of this new ORF-Type is always "one-time
   filtering" and has no impact on existing ORFs, the Action field MUST
   be ignored.

   The matching rules of the One-time Address Prefix ORF are the same as
   defined in Address-Prefix-Based ORF [RFC5292].

   The ORF entries of this type are used as one-time filters that MUST
   not change any previously installed ORF entry on the receiving
   speaker.


3.  Operation

   The capability negotiation of <AFI/SAFI, One-time Address Prefix ORF>
   MUST NOT delay the advertisement of routes with this AFI/SAFI.

   The received One-time Address Prefix ORF entries SHOULD only be used
   for one-time route filtering and MUST NOT be saved locally.  The
   received One-time Address Prefix ORF entries MUST NOT modify the
   outbound route filters on the receiving speaker (either locally
   configured or received from the sending speaker through ORF).

   On receipt of ROUTE-REFRESH message with One-time Address Prefix ORF
   entries, the receiving speaker SHOULD re-advertise to the sending
   speaker the routes from the Adj-RIB-Out associated with the sending
   speaker which pass the entries carried in the One-time Address Prefix
   ORF as well as the locally saved ORFs (if any) received from the
   sending speaker.

   Since different processing orders may lead to different results, the
   One-time ORFs and the regular ORFs SHOULD not be encoded in one
   route-refresh message.

   During the period when the receiving speaker is sending updates to

   satisfy the One-time ORF request, it may experience other routing
   activity that will require it to send updates unrelated to the One-
   time ORF request.  It is permitted to send these updates before it
   has completed sending the One-time ORF related updates.

   Similarly, if a route that passes the One-time ORF has already been
   sent and the receiving speaker experiences routing activity that
   changes this route and the receiving speaker has not yet sent all
   routes to satisfy the One-time ORF request, it is permitted to send
   the changed route immediately.

   Details about how to interoperate when both One-time ORF Capability
   and the Enhanced Route Refresh Capability as described in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-enhanced-route-refresh] are enabled will be
   discussed in the next version.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document specifies a new Outbound Route Filtering (ORF) type,
   One-time Address-Prefix ORF.  The value of the ORF-type needs to be
   assigned by the IANA.


5.  Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues
   in [RFC4271].
