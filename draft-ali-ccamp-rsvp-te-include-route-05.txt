     There are scenarios that require two or more LSPs or segments of 
     LSPs to follow same route in the network. This document specifies 
     methods to communicate route inclusions along the loose hops during 
     path setup using the Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic 
     Engineering (RSVP-TE) protocol.

     1. Introduction 

        There are scenarios that require two or more Label Switched 
        Paths (LSPs) to follow same route in the network. E.g., many 
        deployments require member LSPs of a bundle/ aggregated link (or 
        Forwarding Adjacency (FA))) follow the same route. Possible 
        reasons for two or more LSPs to follow the same end-to-end or 
        partial route include, but are not limited to:  

        .  Fate sharing: an application may require that two or more 
          LSPs fail together. In the example of bundle link this would

          mean that if one component goes down, the entire bundle goes 
          down. 

        .  Homogeneous Attributes: it is often required that two or more 
          LSPs have the same TE metrics like latency, latency variation, 
          etc. In the example of a bundle/ aggregated link this would 
          meet the requirement that all component links (FAs) of a 
          bundle should have same latency and latency variation. As 
          noted in [OSPF-TE-METRIC] and [ISIS-TE-METRIC], in certain 
          networks, such as financial information networks, network 
          performance (e.g. latency and latency variation) is becoming 
          critical and hence having bundles with component links (FAs) 
          with homogeneous latency and latency variation is important.  

        The RSVP-TE specification [RFC3209] and GMPLS extensions to 
        RSVP-TE [RFC3473] allow abstract nodes and resources to be 
        explicitly included in a path setup, e.g., using IPv4 prefix ERO 
        subobject [RFC3209], IPv6 prefix ERO subobject [RFC3209] and 
        Unnumbered Interface ID ERO subobject [RFC3477], etc. However, 
        such inclusion may not be possible in the following scenarios:  

        .  Inclusion of an LSP path which, while known at the source 
          node of the to-be-signaled LSP, where the required detail of 
          the route is incomplete or unavailable, e.g. due to 
          confidentiality of the path attributes. Such cases are likely 
          to arise in Inter-domain and GMPLS overlay networks.  

       These use-cases require the relevant path-inclusion information 
       to be communicated to the route expanding nodes. This document 
       defines the necessary information, encodings, and procedures. 

       This document assumes that node expanding the route is normally a 
       hop of the included LSP. However, there is a race condition in 
       which included LSP is yet to be signaled. This draft addresses 
       this race condition, as detailed in Section 2.2.  

     2. RSVP-TE signaling extensions 

        New IPv4 and IPv6 Point-to-Point (P2P) Path ERO subobject types 
        are defined in this document. These ERO subobjects are used to 
        communicate path inclusion requirements to the ERO expanding 
        node(s). For this purpose, the subobjects carry RSVP-TE 
        Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) of the reference LSP who's 
        Path is be used to expand the loose hop of the LSP being 
        signaled.

          M bit: The M bit usage is as defined for the M bit of IPv4 
          Point-to-Point Path ERO subobject.  
           
          The remaining fields are used to specific RSVP-TE FEC of the 
          reference LSP who's Path is be used to expand the route of the 
          LSP being signaled, as detailed in Section 2.1.  

     2.3. Processing rules for Path ERO subobjects 

        The basic processing rules of an ERO are not altered.  Please 
        refer to [RFC3209] for details.  

        If an LSR strips all local subobjects from an ERO carried in a 
        Path message (according to the procedures in [RFC3209]) and 
        finds that the next subobject is an IPv4 P2P Path ERO subobject 
        or IPv6 P2P LSP subject, it MUST attempt to resolve the Path ERO 
        subobject as described in the following.  

        If the L bit of the Path ERO subobject is not set, i.e., the 
        subobject represents a strict hop in the explicit route, the 
        processing node MUST respond with a PathErr message with the 
        error code "Routing Problem" (24) and the error value "Bad 
        initial subobject" (4). 

        If the M bit is set, the processing node follows the following 
        procedure: 

        -  If the path taken by the LSP referenced in the Path ERO 
          subobject is known to the processing node and the path 
          contains the loose abstract node in the ERO hop, the 
          processing node MUST ensure that loose hop expansion to the 
          next abstract node follows the referenced path.  

        -  If the path taken by the LSP referenced in the Path ERO 
          subobject does not contain the loose abstract node in the ERO 
          hop, the processing node MUST sent a PathErr message with the 
          error code "Routing Problem" (24) and the new error value 
          "unknown or inconsistent LSP suboject" (value to be assigned 
          by IANA) for the signaled LSP.  

        -  If the path referenced in the LSP subobject is unknown to the 
          processing node, the processing node SHOULD ignore the Path 
          ERO subobject and SHOULD proceed with the signaling request. 
          After sending the Resv for the signaled LSP, the processing

          Error" (25) and error sub-code "TBD" (value to be assigned by 
          IANA, suggested value: TBD) for the signaled LSP. 

        If the M bit is not set, the processing node follows the 
        following procedure: 

        -  If the path taken by the LSP referenced in the Path ERO 
          subobject is known to the processing node and the path 
          contains the loose abstract node in the ERO hop, the 
          processing node SHOULD ensure that loose hop expansion to the 
          next abstract node follows the referenced path.  

        -  If the path taken by the LSP referenced in the Path ERO 
          subobject is unknown to the processing node and/ or the 
          referenced path does not contain the loose abstract node in 
          the ERO hop, the processing node SHOULD ignore the route 
          inclusion specified in the Path ERO subobject and SHOULD 
          compute a suitable path to the loose abstract node in the ERO 
          hop and proceed with the signaling request. After sending the 
          Resv for the signaled LSP, the processing node SHOULD return a 
          PathErr with the error code "Notify Error" (25) and error sub-
          code " unknown or inconsistent LSP suboject" (value to be 
          assigned by IANA) for the signaled LSP. 

     3. Security Considerations 

        This document does not introduce any additional security issues 
        above those identified in [RFC5920], [RFC2205], [RFC3209], and 
        [RFC3473] and [RFC4874].  

     4. IANA Considerations 

     4.1. New ERO subobject types 

        This document adds the following new subobject of the existing 
        entry for ERO (20, EXPLICIT_ROUTE):  

        Value                      Description 

        -----                      ------------ 

        TBA                        IPv4 Point-to-Point Path ERO 
        subobject 

        TBA                        IPv6 Point-to-Point Path ERO 
        subobject

        These subobject may be present in the Explicit Route Object, but 
        not in the Route Record Object.  

         
     4.2. New RSVP error sub-codes  

        IANA registry: RSVP PARAMETERS 
        Subsection: Error Codes and Globally-Defined Error Value Sub-
        Codes  
         
        For Error Code "Routing Problem" (24) (see [RFC3209]) the 
        following sub-codes are defined. 
         
        Sub-code                               Value 
        --------                               ----- 
      
        Unknown or inconsistent LSP suboject   To be assigned by IANA. 
         
        For Error Code "Notify Error" (25) (see [RFC3209]) the following 
        sub-codes are defined. 
         
         
        Sub-code                               Value 
        --------                               ----- 
      
        Unknown or inconsistent LSP suboject   To be assigned by IANA.
