Internet-Draft                    MAP                       January 2013

1.  Introduction

   Mapping of IPv4 addresses in IPv6 addresses has been described in
   numerous mechanisms dating back to 1996 [RFC1933].  The Automatic
   tunneling mechanism described in RFC1933, assigned a globally unique
   IPv6 address to a host by combining the host's IPv4 address with a
   well-known IPv6 prefix.  Given an IPv6 packet with a destination
   address with an embedded IPv4 address, a node could automatically
   tunnel this packet by extracting the IPv4 tunnel end-point address
   from the IPv6 destination address.

   There are numerous variations of this idea, described in 6over4
   [RFC2529], 6to4 [RFC3056], ISATAP [RFC5214], and 6rd [RFC5969].

   The commonalities of all these IPv6 over IPv4 mechanisms are:

   o  Automatically provisions an IPv6 address for a host or an IPv6
      prefix for a site

   o  Algorithmic or implicit address resolution of tunnel end point
      addresses.  Given an IPv6 destination address, an IPv4 tunnel
      endpoint address can be calculated.

   o  Embedding of an IPv4 address or part thereof into an IPv6 address.

   In phases of IPv4 to IPv6 migration, IPv6 only networks will be
   common, while there will still be a need for residual IPv4
   deployment.  This document describes a generic mapping of IPv4 to
   IPv6, and a mechanism for encapsulating IPv4 over IPv6.

   Just as the IPv6 over IPv4 mechanisms referred to above, the residual
   IPv4 over IPv6 mechanism must be capable of:

   o  Provisioning an IPv4 prefix, an IPv4 address or a shared IPv4
      address.

   o  Algorithmically map between an IPv4 prefix, IPv4 address or a
      shared IPv4 address and an IPv6 address.

   The mapping scheme described here supports encapsulation of IPv4
   packets in IPv6 in both mesh and hub and spoke topologies, including
   address mappings with full independence between IPv6 and IPv4
   addresses.

   This document describes delivery of IPv4 unicast service across an
   IPv6 infrastructure.  IPv4 multicast is not considered further in
   this document.

   The A+P (Address and Port) architecture of sharing an IPv4 address by
   distributing the port space is described in [RFC6346].  Specifically
   section 4 of [RFC6346] covers stateless mapping.  The corresponding

   stateful solution DS-lite is described in [RFC6333].  The motivation
   for the work is described in [I-D.ietf-softwire-stateless-
   4v6-motivation].

   A companion document defines a DHCPv6 option for provisioning of MAP
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-dhcp].  Other means of provisioning is
   possible.  Deployment considerations are described in [I-D.mdt-
   softwire-map-deployment].

   MAP relies on IPv6 and is designed to deliver production-quality
   dual-stack service while allowing IPv4 to be phased out within the SP
   network.  The phasing out of IPv4 within the SP network is
   independent of whether the end user disables IPv4 service or not.
   Further, "Greenfield"; IPv6-only networks may use MAP in order to
   deliver IPv4 to sites via the IPv6 network.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   MAP domain:             One or more MAP CEs and BRs connected to the
                           same virtual link.  A service provider may
                           deploy a single MAP domain, or may utilize
                           multiple MAP domains.

   MAP Rule                A set of parameters describing the mapping
                           between an IPv4 prefix, IPv4 address or
                           shared IPv4 address and an IPv6 prefix or
                           address.  Each domain uses a different
                           mapping rule set.

   MAP node                A device that implements MAP.

   MAP Border Relay (BR):  A MAP enabled router managed by the service
                           provider at the edge of a MAP domain.  A
                           Border Relay router has at least an
                           IPv6-enabled interface and an IPv4 interface
                           connected to the native IPv4 network.  A MAP
                           BR may also be referred to simply as a "BR"
                           within the context of MAP.

   MAP Customer Edge (CE): A device functioning as a Customer Edge
                           router in a MAP deployment.  A typical MAP CE
                           adopting MAP rules will serve a residential
                           site with one WAN side interface, and one or

                           more LAN side interfaces.  A MAP CE may also
                           be referred to simply as a "CE" within the
                           context of MAP.

   Port-set:               The separate part of the transport layer port
                           space; denoted as a port-set.

   Port-set ID (PSID):     Algorithmically identifies a set of ports
                           exclusively assigned to a CE.

   Shared IPv4 address:    An IPv4 address that is shared among multiple
                           CEs.  Only ports that belong to the assigned
                           port-set can be used for communication.  Also
                           known as a Port-Restricted IPv4 address.

   End-user IPv6 prefix:   The IPv6 prefix assigned to an End-user CE by
                           other means than MAP itself.  E.g.
                           Provisioned using DHCPv6 PD [RFC3633],
                           assigned via SLAAC [RFC4861], or configured
                           manually.  It is unique for each CE.

   MAP IPv6 address:       The IPv6 address used to reach the MAP
                           function of a CE from other CEs and from BRs.

   Rule IPv6 prefix:       An IPv6 prefix assigned by a Service Provider
                           for a mapping rule.

   Rule IPv4 prefix:       An IPv4 prefix assigned by a Service Provider
                           for a mapping rule.

   Embedded Address (EA) bits: The IPv4 EA-bits in the IPv6 address
                           identify an IPv4 prefix/address (or part
                           thereof) or a shared IPv4 address (or part
                           thereof) and a port-set identifier.

4.  Architecture

   The MAP mechanism uses existing standard building blocks.  The
   existing NAPT on the CE is used with additional support for
   restricting transport protocol ports, ICMP identifiers and fragment
   identifiers to the configured port set.  MAP supports the
   encapsulation mode specified in [RFC2473].  In addition MAP specifies
   an algorithm to do "address resolution" from an IPv4 address and port
   to an IPv6 address.  This algorithmic mapping is specified in Section
   5.

   A full IPv4 address or IPv4 prefix can be used like today, e.g.  For
   identifying an interface or as a DHCP pool.  A shared IPv4 address on
   the other hand, MUST NOT be used to identify an interface.  While it
   is theoretically possible to make host stacks and applications port-

   aware, that is considered a too drastic change to the IP model
   [RFC6250].

   The MAP architecture described here, restricts the use of the shared
   IPv4 address to only be used as the global address (outside) of the
   NAPT [RFC2663] running on the CE.  The NAPT MUST in turn be connected
   to a MAP aware forwarding function, that does encapsulation/
   decapsulation of IPv4 packets in IPv6.

   When MAP is used to provision a full IPv4 address or an IPv4 prefix
   to the CE, these restrictions do not apply.

   For packets outbound from the private IPv4 network, the CE NAPT MUST
   translate transport identifiers (e.g.  TCP and UDP port numbers) so
   that they fall within the assigned CE's port-range.

   The MAP BR is responsible for connecting external IPv4 networks to
   the IPv4 nodes in one or more MAP domains.

5.  Mapping Algorithm

   A MAP node is provisioned with one or more mapping rules.



Troan, et al.            Expires July 28, 2013                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                    MAP                       January 2013


   Mapping rules are used differently depending on their function.
   Every MAP node must be provisioned with a Basic mapping rule.  This
   is used by the node to configure its IPv4 address, IPv4 prefix or
   shared IPv4 address.  This same basic rule can also be used for
   forwarding, where an IPv4 destination address and optionally a
   destination port is mapped into an IPv6 address.  Additional mapping
   rules are specified to allow for multiple different IPv4 sub-nets to
   exist within the domain and optimize forwarding between them.

   Traffic outside of the domain (i.e.  When the destination IPv4
   address does not match (using longest matching prefix) any Rule IPv4
   prefix in the Rules database) is forwarded to the BR.

   There are two types of mapping rules:

   1.  Basic Mapping Rule (BMR) - mandatory, used for IPv4 prefix,
       address or port set assignment.  There can only be one Basic
       Mapping Rule per End-user IPv6 prefix.  The Basic Mapping Rule is
       used to configure the MAP IPv6 address or prefix.

   2.  Forwarding Mapping Rule (FMR) - optional, used for forwarding.
       The Basic Mapping Rule is also a Forwarding Mapping Rule.  Each
       Forwarding Mapping Rule will result in an entry in the Rules
       table for the Rule IPv4 prefix.

   Both mapping rules share the same parameters:

   o  Rule IPv6 prefix (including prefix length)

   o  Rule IPv4 prefix (including prefix length)

   o  Rule EA-bits length (in bits)

   o  Rule Port Parameters (optional)

   A MAP node finds its Basic Mapping Rule by doing a longest match
   between the End-user IPv6 prefix and the Rule IPv6 prefix in the
   Mapping Rules table.  The rule is then used for IPv4 prefix, address
   or shared address assignment.

   A MAP IPv6 address is formed from the BMR Rule IPv6 prefix.  This
   address MUST be assigned to an interface of the MAP node and is used
   to terminate all MAP traffic being sent or received to the node.

Internet-Draft                    MAP                       January 2013

   Port-aware IPv4 entries in the Rules table are installed for all the
   Forwarding Mapping Rules and an IPv4 default route to the MAP BR.

   Forwarding rules are used to allow direct communication between MAP
   CEs, known as mesh mode.  In hub and spoke mode, there are no
   forwarding rules, all traffic MUST be forwarded directly to the BR.

5.1.  Port mapping algorithm

   The port mapping algorithm is used in domains whose rules allow IPv4
   address sharing.

   The simplest way to represent a port range is using a notation
   similar to CIDR [RFC4632].  For example the first 256 ports are
   represented as port prefix 0.0/8.  The last 256 ports as 255.0/8.  In
   hexadecimal, 0x0000/8 (PSID = 0) and 0xFF00/8 (PSID = 0xFF).

   To minimise dependencies between the End-user IPv6 prefix and the
   resulting port set, a PSID of 0, would, in the naive representation
   assign the system ports [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-iana-ports] to the user.
   Instead using an infix representation, and requiring that the first
   bit field (A) is greater than 0, the well known ports are excluded.

5.2.  Basic mapping rule (BMR)

   The Basic Mapping Rule is mandatory, used by the CE to provision
   itself with an IPv4 prefix, IPv4 address or shared IPv4 address.

   |<---  End-user IPv6 prefix  --->|
   

                     Figure 3: IPv6 address format

   The Rule IPv6 prefix is the part of the End-user IPv6 prefix that is
   common among all CEs using the same Basic Mapping Rule within the MAP
   domain.  The EA bits encode the CE specific IPv4 address and port
   information.  The EA bits, which are unique for a given Rule IPv6
   prefix, can contain a full or part of an IPv4 address and, in the
   shared IPv4 address case, a Port-Set Identifier (PSID).  An EA-bit
   length of 0 signifies that all relevant MAP IPv4 addressing
   information is passed directly in the BMR rule, and not derived from
   the End-user IPv6 prefix.

   The MAP IPv6 address is created by concatenating the End-user IPv6
   prefix with the MAP subnet-id (if the End-user IPv6 prefix is shorter
   than 64 bits) and the interface-id as specified in Section 6.

   The MAP subnet ID is defined to be the first subnet (all bits set to
   zero).  Unless configured differently, a MAP node MUST reserve the
   first IPv6 prefix in an End-user IPv6 prefix for the purpose of MAP.

   The MAP IPv6 is created by combining the End-User IPv6 prefix with
   the all zeros subnet-id and the MAP IPv6 interface identifier.

                           Shared IPv4 address:

                         Figure 6: IPv4 prefix

   The length of r MAY be zero, in which case the complete IPv4 address
   or prefix is encoded in the EA bits.  If only a part of the IPv4
   address/prefix is encoded in the EA bits, the Rule IPv4 prefix is
   provisioned to the CE by other means (e.g.  a DHCPv6 option).  To
   create a complete IPv4 address (or prefix), the IPv4 address suffix
   (p) from the EA bits, are concatenated with the Rule IPv4 prefix (r
   bits).

   The offset of the EA bits field in the IPv6 address is equal to the
   BMR Rule IPv6 prefix length.  The length of the EA bits field (o) is
   given by the BMR Rule EA-bits length, and can be between 0 and 48.
   The sum of the Rule IPv6 Prefix length and the Rule EA-bits length
   MUST be less or equal than the End-user IPv6 prefix length.

   If o + r < 32 (length of the IPv4 address in bits), then an IPv4
   prefix is assigned.

   If o + r is equal to 32, then a full IPv4 address is to be assigned.
   The address is created by concatenating the Rule IPv4 prefix and the
   EA-bits.

   If o + r is > 32, then a shared IPv4 address is to be assigned.  The
   number of IPv4 address suffix bits (p) in the EA bits is given by 32
   - r bits.  The PSID bits are used to create a port-set.  The length

   of the PSID bit field within EA bits is: o - p.

   The length of r MAY be 32, with no part of the IPv4 address embedded
   in the EA bits.  This results in a mapping with no dependence between
   the IPv4 address and the IPv6 address.  In addition the length of o
   MAY be zero (no EA bits embedded in the End-User IPv6 prefix),
   meaning that also the PSID is provisioned using e.g.  the DHCP
   option.

   See Appendix A for an example of the Basic Mapping Rule.

5.3.  Forwarding mapping rule (FMR)

   The Forwarding Mapping Rule is optional, and used in mesh mode to
   merit direct CE to CE connectivity.

   On adding an FMR rule, an IPv4 route is installed in the Rules table
   for the Rule IPv4 prefix.

   On forwarding an IPv4 packet, a best matching prefix look up is done
   in the Rules table and the correct FMR is chosen.

5.4.  Destinations outside the MAP domain

   To reach IPv4 destinations outside of the MAP domain, traffic is sent
   to the configured address of the MAP BR.  On the CE, the default can

   be represented as a point to point IPv4 over IPv6 tunnel [RFC2473] to
   the BR.

6.  The IPv6 Interface Identifier

   The Interface identifier format of a MAP node is based on the format
   specified in section 2.2 of [RFC6052], with the added PSID field if
   present, as shown in figure Figure 8.

   
   +--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   |PL|   8  16  24  32  40  48  56   |
   +--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   |64| u | IPv4 address  |  PSID | 0 |
   +--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   

                                Figure 8

   In the case of an IPv4 prefix, the IPv4 address field is right-padded
   with zeroes up to 32 bits.  The PSID field is left-padded to create a
   16 bit field.  For an IPv4 prefix or a complete IPv4 address, the
   PSID field is zero.

   If the End-user IPv6 prefix length is larger than 64, the most
   significant parts of the interface identifier is overwritten by the
   prefix.

7.  MAP Configuration

   For a given MAP domain, the BR and CE MUST be configured with the
   following MAP elements.  The configured values for these elements are
   identical for all CEs and BRs within a given MAP domain.

   o  The End-User IPv6 prefix (Part of the normal IPv6 provisioning).

   o  The Basic Mapping Rule and optionally the Forwarding Mapping
      Rules, including the Rule IPv6 prefix, Rule IPv4 prefix, and
      Length of EA bits

   o  The IPv6 address of the MAP BR.

   o  Hub and spoke mode or Mesh mode.  (If all traffic should be sent
      to the BR, or if direct CE to CE traffic should be supported).

7.1.  MAP CE









Troan, et al.            Expires July 28, 2013                 [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                    MAP                       January 2013


   The MAP elements are set to values that are the same across all CEs
   within a MAP domain.  The values may be configured in a variety of
   manners, including provisioning methods such as the Broadband Forum's
   "TR-69" Residential Gateway management interface, an XML-based object
   retrieved after IPv6 connectivity is established, or manual
   configuration by an administrator.  This document describes how to
   configure the necessary parameters via a single IPv6 DHCP option.  A
   CE that allows IPv6 configuration by DHCP SHOULD implement this
   option.  Other configuration and management methods may use the
   format described by this option for consistency and convenience of
   implementation on CEs that support multiple configuration methods.

   The only remaining provisioning information the CE requires in order
   to calculate the MAP IPv4 address and enable IPv4 connectivity is the
   IPv6 prefix for the CE.  The End-user IPv6 prefix is configured as
   part of obtaining IPv6 Internet access.

   A single MAP CE MAY be connected to more than one MAP domain, just as
   any router may have more than one IPv4-enabled service provider
   facing interface and more than one set of associated addresses
   assigned by DHCP.  Each domain a given CE operates within would
   require its own set of MAP configuration elements and would generate
   its own IPv4 address.

   The MAP DHCP option is specified in [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-dhcp].

7.2.  MAP BR

   The MAP BR MUST be configured with the same MAP elements as the MAP
   CEs operating within the same domain.

   For increased reliability and load balancing, the BR IPv6 address MAY
   be an anycast address shared across a given MAP domain.  As MAP is
   stateless, any BR may be used at any time.  If the BR IPv6 address is
   anycast the relay MUST use this anycast IPv6 address as the source
   address in packets relayed to CEs.

   Since MAP uses provider address space, no specific routes need to be
   advertised externally for MAP to operate, neither in IPv6 nor IPv4
   BGP.  However, if anycast is used for the MAP IPv6 relays, the
   anycast addresses must be advertised in the service provider's IGP.

7.3.  Backwards compatibility

   A MAP-E CE provisioned with only the IPv6 address of the BR, and with
   no IPv4 address and port range configured by other means, MUST
   disable its NAT44 functionality.  This characteristic makes a MAP CE
   compatible with DS-Lite [RFC6333] AFTRs, whose addresses are
   configured as the MAP BR.

7.4.  Address Independence



Troan, et al.            Expires July 28, 2013                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                    MAP                       January 2013


   The MAP solution supports use and configuration of domains in so
   called 1:1 mode (meaning 1 mapping rule set per CE), which allows
   complete independence between the IPv6 prefix assigned to the CE and
   the IPv4 address and/or port-range it uses.  This is achieved in all
   cases when the EA-bit length is set to 0.

   The constraint imposed is that each such MAP domain be composed of
   just 1 MAP CE which has a predetermined IPv6 prefix, i.e.  The BR
   would be configured with a rule-set per CPE, where the FMR would
   uniquely describe the IPv6 prefix of a given CE.  Each CE would have
   a distinct BMR, that would fully describe that CE's IPv4 address, and
   PSID if any.

8.  Forwarding Considerations

   Figure 1 depicts the overall MAP architecture with IPv4 users (N and
   M) networks connected to a routed IPv6 network.

   MAP supports Encapsulation mode as specified in [RFC2473].

   For a shared IPv4 address, a MAP CE forwarding IPv4 packets from the
   LAN performs NAT44 functions first and creates appropriate NAT44
   bindings.  The resulting IPv4 packets MUST contain the source IPv4
   address and source transport identifiers defined by MAP.  The
   resulting IPv4 packet is forwarded to the CE's MAP forwarding
   function.  The IPv6 source and destination addresses MUST then be
   derived as per Section 5 of this draft.

   A MAP CE receiving an IPv6 packet to its MAP IPv6 address sends this
   packet to the CE's MAP function.  All other IPv6 traffic is forwarded
   as per the CE's IPv6 routing rules.  The resulting IPv4 packet is
   then forwarded to the CE's NAT44 function where the destination port
   number MUST be checked against the stateful port mapping session
   table and the destination port number MUST be mapped to its original
   value.

8.1.  Receiving rules

   The CE SHOULD check that MAP received packets' transport-layer
   destination port number is in the range configured by MAP for the CE
   and the CE SHOULD drop any non conforming packet and respond with an
   ICMPv6 "Address Unreachable" (Type 1, Code 3).

8.2.  MAP BR










Troan, et al.            Expires July 28, 2013                 [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                    MAP                       January 2013


   A MAP BR receiving IPv6 packets selects a best matching MAP domain
   rule based on a longest address match of the packets' source address
   against the BR's configured MAP BMR prefix(es), as well as a match of
   the packet destination address against the configured BR IPv6 address
   or FMR prefix(es).  The selected MAP rule allows the BR to determine
   the EA-bits from the source IPv6 address.  The BR MUST perform a
   validation of the consistency of the source IPv6 address and source
   port number for the packet using BMR.  If the packets source port
   number is found to be outside the range allowed for this CE and the
   BMR, the BR MUST drop the packet and respond with an ICMPv6
   "Destination Unreachable, Source address failed ingress/egress
   policy" (Type 1, Code 5).

9.  ICMP

   ICMP message should be supported in MAP domain.  Hence, the NAT44 in
   MAP CE must implement the behavior for ICMP message conforming to the
   best current practice documented in [RFC5508].

   If a MAP CE receives an ICMP message having ICMP identifier field in
   ICMP header, NAT44 in the MAP CE must rewrite this field to a
   specific value assigned from the port-set.  BR and other CEs must
   handle this field similar to the port number in the TCP/UDP header
   upon receiving the ICMP message with ICMP identifier field.

   If a MAP node receives an ICMP error message without the ICMP
   identifier field for errors that is detected inside a IPv6 tunnel, a
   node should relay the ICMP error message to the original source.
   This behavior should be implemented conforming to the section 8 of
   [RFC2473].

10.  Fragmentation and Path MTU Discovery

   Due to the different sizes of the IPv4 and IPv6 header, handling the
   maximum packet size is relevant for the operation of any system
   connecting the two address families.  There are three mechanisms to
   handle this issue: Path MTU discovery (PMTUD), fragmentation, and
   transport-layer negotiation such as the TCP Maximum Segment Size
   (MSS) option [RFC0897].  MAP uses all three mechanisms to deal with
   different cases.

10.1.  Fragmentation in the MAP domain

   Encapsulating an IPv4 packet to carry it across the MAP domain will
   increase its size (40 bytes).  It is strongly recommended that the
   MTU in the MAP domain is well managed and that the IPv6 MTU on the CE
   WAN side interface is set so that no fragmentation occurs within the







Troan, et al.            Expires July 28, 2013                 [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                    MAP                       January 2013

   boundary of the MAP domain.

   Fragmentation on MAP domain entry is described in section 7.2 of
   [RFC2473]

   The use of an anycast source address could lead to any ICMP error
   message generated on the path being sent to a different BR.
   Therefore, using dynamic tunnel MTU Section 6.7 of [RFC2473] is
   subject to IPv6 Path MTU black-holes.  A MAP BR SHOULD NOT by default
   use Path MTU discovery across the MAP domain.

   Multiple BRs using the same anycast source address could send
   fragmented packets to the same CE at the same time.  If the
   fragmented packets from different BRs happen to use the same fragment
   ID, incorrect reassembly might occur.  See [RFC4459] for an analysis
   of the problem.  Section 3.4 suggests solving the problem by
   fragmenting the inner packet.

10.2.  Receiving IPv4 Fragments on the MAP domain borders

   Forwarding of an IPv4 packet received from the outside of the MAP
   domain requires the IPv4 destination address and the transport
   protocol destination port.  The transport protocol information is
   only available in the first fragment received.  As described in
   section 5.3.3 of [RFC6346] a MAP node receiving an IPv4 fragmented
   packet from outside has to reassemble the packet before sending the
   packet onto the MAP link.  If the first packet received contains the
   transport protocol information, it is possible to optimize this
   behavior by using a cache and forwarding the fragments unchanged.  A
   description of this algorithm is outside the scope of this document.

10.3.  Sending IPv4 fragments to the outside

   If two IPv4 host behind two different MAP CE's with the same IPv4





















Troan, et al.            Expires July 28, 2013                 [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                    MAP                       January 2013

   address sends fragments to an IPv4 destination host outside the
   domain.  Those hosts may use the same IPv4 fragmentation identifier,
   resulting in incorrect reassembly of the fragments at the destination
   host.  Given that the IPv4 fragmentation identifier is a 16 bit
   field, it could be used similarly to port ranges.  A MAP CE SHOULD
   rewrite the IPv4 fragmentation identifier to be within its allocated
   port set.

11.  NAT44 Considerations

   The NAT44 implemented in the MAP CE SHOULD conform with the behavior
   and best current practice documented in [RFC4787], [RFC5508], and
   [RFC5382].  In MAP address sharing mode (determined by the MAP domain
   /rule configuration parameters) the operation of the NAT44 MUST be
   restricted to the available port numbers derived via the basic
   mapping rule.

12.  IANA Considerations

   This specification does not require any IANA actions.

13.  Security Considerations

   Spoofing attacks: With consistency checks between IPv4 and IPv6
      sources that are performed on IPv4/IPv6 packets received by MAP
      nodes, MAP does not introduce any new opportunity for spoofing
      attacks that would not already exist in IPv6.

   Denial-of-service attacks: In MAP domains where IPv4 addresses are
      shared, the fact that IPv4 datagram reassembly may be necessary
      introduces an opportunity for DOS attacks.  This is inherent to
      address sharing, and is common with other address sharing
      approaches such as DS-Lite and NAT64/DNS64.  The best protection
      against such attacks is to accelerate IPv6 deployment, so that,
      where MAP is supported, it is less and less used.

   Routing-loop attacks: This attack may exist in some automatic


















Troan, et al.            Expires July 28, 2013                 [Page 17]

Internet-Draft                    MAP                       January 2013

      tunneling scenarios are documented in [RFC6324].  They cannot
      exist with MAP because each BRs checks that the IPv6 source
      address of a received IPv6 packet is a CE address based on
      Forwarding Mapping Rule.

   Attacks facilitated by restricted port           set: From hosts that
      are not subject to ingress filtering of [RFC2827], some attacks
      are possible by an attacker injecting spoofed packets during
      ongoing transport connections ([RFC4953], [RFC5961], [RFC6056].
      The attacks depend on guessing which ports are currently used by
      target hosts, and using an unrestricted port set is preferable,
      i.e.  Using native IPv6 connections that are not subject to MAP
      port range restrictions.  To minimize this type of attacks when
      using a restricted port set, the MAP CE's NAT44 filtering behavior
      SHOULD be "Address-Dependent Filtering".  Furthermore, the MAP CEs
      SHOULD use a DNS transport proxy function to handle DNS traffic,
      and source such traffic from IPv6 interfaces not assigned to MAP.
      Practicalities of these methods are discussed in Section 5.9 of
      [I-D.dec-stateless-4v6].

   [RFC6269] outlines general issues with IPv4 address sharing.

      Given the MAP domain information and an IPv6 address of
      an endpoint:
   
      IPv6 prefix assigned to the end user:  2001:db8:0012:3400::/56
      Basic Mapping Rule:  {2001:db8:0000::/40 (Rule IPv6 prefix),
         192.0.2.0/24 (Rule IPv4 prefix), 16 (Rule EA-bits length)}
      PSID length:  (16 - (32 - 24) = 8. (Sharing ratio of 256)
      PSID offset:  4
   
      A MAP node (CE or BR) can via the BMR, or equivalent FMR,
      determine the IPv4 address and port-set as shown below:
   
      EA bits offset:  40
      IPv4 suffix bits (p)  Length of IPv4 address (32) - IPv4 prefix
         length (24) = 8
      IPv4 address  192.0.2.18 (0xc0000212)
      PSID start:  40 + p = 40 + 8 = 48
      PSID length:  o - p = (56 - 40) - 8 = 8
      PSID:  0x34
   
      Port-set-1:  4928, 4929, 4930, 4931, 4932, 4933, 4934, 4935, 4936,

      The BMR information allows a MAP CE also to determine (complete)
      its IPv6 address within the indicated IPv6 prefix.
   
      IPv6 address of MAP CE:  2001:db8:0012:3400:00c0:0002:1200:3400

      Another example can be made of a hypothetical MAP BR,
      configured with the following FMR when receiving a packet
      with the following characteristics:
   
      IPv4 source address:  1.2.3.4 (0x01020304)
      IPv4 source port:  80
      IPv4 destination address:  192.0.2.18 (0xc0000212)
      IPv4 destination port:  9030
   
      Configured Forwarding Mapping Rule:  {2001:db8:0000::/40
         (Rule IPv6 prefix), 192.0.2.0/24 (Rule IPv4 prefix),
         16 (Rule EA-bits length)}
   
      MAP BR Prefix  2001:db8:ffff::/64
   
      The above information allows the BR to derive as follows
      the mapped destination IPv6 address for the corresponding
      MAP CE, and also the mapped source IPv6 address for
      the IPv4 source.
   
      IPv4 suffix bits (p)  32 - 24 = 8 (18 (0x12))
      PSID length:  8
      PSID:  0x34 (9030 (0x2346))
   
      The resulting IPv6 packet will have the following key fields:
   
      IPv6 source address  2001:db8:ffff:0:0001:0203:0400::
      IPv6 destination address:  2001:db8:0012:3400:00c0:0002:1200:3400
      IPv6 source Port:  80
      IPv6 destination Port:  9030
   

   Example 3 - FMR:

   
      An IPv4 host behind the MAP CE (addressed as per the previous
      examples) corresponding with IPv4 host 1.2.3.4 will have its
      packets converted into IPv6 using the IPv6 address of the BR
      configured on the MAP CE as follows:
   
      IPv6 address of BR used by MAP CE:  2001:db8:ffff::1
      IPv4 source address (post NAT44 if present)  192.0.2.18
      IPv4 destination address:  1.2.3.4
      IPv4 source port (post NAT44 if present):  9030
      IPv4 destination port:  80
      IPv6 source address of MAP CE:
                           2001:db8:0012:3400:00c0:0002:1200:3400
      IPv6 destination address:  2001:db8:ffff:0:0001:0203:0400::

Appendix B.  Alternate description of the Port mapping algorithm

   The port mapping algorithm is used in domains whose rules allow IPv4
   address sharing.  Different Port-Set Identifiers (PSID) MUST have
   non-overlapping port-sets.  The two extreme cases are: (1) the port
   numbers are not contiguous for each PSID, but uniformly distributed
   across the port range (0-65535); (2) the port numbers are contiguous
   in a single range for each PSID.  The port mapping algorithm proposed
   here is called the Generalized Modulus Algorithm (GMA) and supports
   both these cases.

   For a given sharing ratio (R) and the maximum number of contiguous
   ports (M), the GMA algorithm is defined as:

   1.  The port number (P) of a given PSID (K) is composed of:

   P = R * M * j + M * K + i


Troan, et al.            Expires July 28, 2013                 [Page 26]

Internet-Draft                    MAP                       January 2013


   Where:

   *  PSID: K = 0 to R - 1

   *  Port range index: j = (4096 / M) / R to ((65536 / M) / R) - 1, if
      the port numbers (0 - 4095) are excluded.

   *  Contiguous Port index: i = 0 to M - 1

   2.  The PSID (K) of a given port number (P) is determined by:

   K = (floor(P/M)) % R

   Where:

   *  % is the modulus operator

   *  floor(arg) is a function that returns the largest integer not
      greater than arg.

B.1.  Bit Representation of the Algorithm

   Given a sharing ratio (R=2^k), the maximum number of contiguous ports
   (M=2^m), for any PSID (K) and available ports (P) can be represented
   as:

   0                          8                         15

   Where j and i are the same indexes defined in the port mapping
   algorithm.

   For any port number, the PSID can be obtained by bit mask operation.

   For a > 0, j MUST be larger than 0.  This ensures that the algorithm
   excludes the system ports ([I-D.ietf-tsvwg-iana-ports]).  For a = 0,
   j MAY be 0 to allow for the provisioning of the system ports.

B.2.  GMA examples

   For example, for R = 1024, PSID offset: a = 4 and PSID length: k = 10
   bits

             Port-set-1                Port-set-2
   PSID=0   | 4096, 4097, 4098, 4099, | 8192,  8193,  8194,  8195, | ...
   PSID=1   | 4100, 4101, 4102, 4103, | 8196,  8197,  8198,  8199, | ...
   PSID=2   | 4104, 4105, 4106, 4107, | 8200,  8201,  8202,  8203, | ...
   PSID=3   | 4108, 4109, 4110, 4111, | 8204,  8205,  8206,  8207, | ...
   ...
   PSID=1023| 8188, 8189, 8190, 8191, | 12284, 12285, 12286, 12287,| ...
   

   For example, for R = 64, a = 0 (PSID offset = 0 and PSID length = 6
   bits):

             Port-set
   PSID=0   | [   0 - 1023]
   PSID=1   | [1024 - 2047]
   PSID=2   | [2048 - 3071]
   PSID=3   | [3072 - 4095]
   ...
   PSID=63  | [64512 - 65535]
   

B.3.  Port Offset

   The number of offset bits (excluded ports) are optionally provisioned
   via the "Rule Port Mapping Parameters" in the Basic Mapping Rule.

   The default Offset bits (a) are: 4

   To simplify the GMA port mapping algorithm the defaults are chosen so
   that the PSID field starts on a nibble boundary and the excluded port
   range (0-1023) is extended to 0-4095.

   For (a) offset bits, the range of excluded ports is 0 to 2 ^ (16-a) -
   1.
