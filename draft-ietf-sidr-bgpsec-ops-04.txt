Internet-Draft      BGPsec Operational Considerations         March 2012


1.  Introduction

   BGPsec is a new protocol with many operational considerations.  It is
   expected to be deployed incrementally over a number of years.  As
   core BGPsec-capable routers may require large memory and/or modern
   CPUs, it is thought that origin validation based on the RPKI will
   occur over the next one to three years and that BGPsec will start to
   deploy late in that window.

   BGPsec relies on widespread propagation of the Resource Public Key
   Infrastructure (RPKI) [RFC6480].  How the RPKI is distributed and
   maintained globally and within an operator's infrastructure may be
   different for BGPsec than for origin validation.

   BGPsec need be spoken only by an AS's eBGP speaking, AKA border,
   routers, and is designed so that it can be used to protect
   announcements which are originated by small edge routers.  This has
   special operational considerations.

   Different prefixes have different timing and replay protection
   considerations.


2.  Suggested Reading

   It is assumed that the reader understands BGP, [RFC4271], BGPsec,
   [I-D.lepinski-bgpsec-overview], the RPKI, see [RFC6480], the RPKI
   Repository Structure, see [RFC6481], and ROAs, see [RFC6482].


3.  RPKI Distribution and Maintenance

   All non-ROA considerations in the section on RPKI Distribution and
   Maintenance of [I-D.ietf-sidr-origin-ops] apply.


4.  AS/Router Certificates

   As described in [I-D.ymbk-bgpsec-rtr-rekeying] routers MAY be capable
   of generating their own public/private key-pairs and having their
   certificates signed and published in the RPKI by the RPKI CA system,
   and/or MAY be given public/private key-pairs by the operator.

   A site/operator MAY use a single certificate/key in all their
   routers, one certificate/key per router, or any granularity in
   between.

   A large operator, concerned that a compromise of one router's key

Internet-Draft      BGPsec Operational Considerations         March 2012


   would make other routers vulnerable, MAY accept a more complex
   certificate/key distribution burden to reduce this exposure.

   On the other extreme, an edge site with one or two routers MAY use a
   single certificate/key.


5.  Within a Network

   BGPsec is spoken by edge routers in a network, those which border
   other networks/ASs.

   In a fully BGPsec enabled AS, Route Reflectors MUST have BGPsec
   enabled if and only if there are eBGP speakers in their client cone,
   i.e. an RR client or the transitive closure of their customers'
   customers' customers' ....

   A BGPsec capable router MAY use the data it receives to influence
   local policy within its network, see Section 7.  In deployment this
   policy should fit into the AS's existing policy, preferences, etc.
   This allows a network to incrementally deploy BGPsec capable border
   routers.

   eBGP speakers which face more critical peers or up/downstreams would
   be candidates for the earliest deployment.  Both securing one's own
   announcements and validating received announcements should be
   considered in partial deployment.

   On the other hand, an operator wanting to monitor router loading,
   shifts in traffic, etc. will want to deploy incrementally while
   watching those and similar effects.

   As they are not signed, an eBGP listener SHOULD NOT strongly trust
   unsigned markings such as communities received across a trust
   boundary.


6.  Considerations for Edge Sites

   An edge site which does not provide transit and trusts its
   upstream(s) SHOULD only originate a signed prefix announcement and
   need not validate received announcements.

   BGPsec protocol capability negotiation provides for a speaker signing
   the data it sends but being unable to accept signed data.  Thus a
   smallish edge router may hold only its own signing key(s) and sign
   it's announcement but not receive signed announcements and therefore
   not need to deal with the majority of the RPKI.  Thus such routers

Internet-Draft      BGPsec Operational Considerations         March 2012


   CPU, RAM, and crypto needs are trivial and additional hardware should
   not be needed.

   As the vast majority (84%) of ASs are stubs, and they announce the
   majority of prefixes, this allows for simpler and less expensive
   incremental deployment.  It may also mean that edge sites concerned
   with routing security will be attracted to upstreams which support
   BGPsec.


7.  Routing Policy

   Unlike origin validation based on the RPKI, BGPsec marks a received
   announcement as Valid or Invalid, there is no NotFound state.  How
   this is used in routing is up to the operator's local policy.  See
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-pfx-validate].

   As BGPsec will be rolled out over years and does not allow for
   intermediate non-signing edge routers, coverage will be spotty for a
   long time.  Hence a normal operator's policy SHOULD NOT be overly
   strict, perhaps preferring valid announcements and giving very low
   preference, but still using, invalid announcements.

   A BGPsec speaker validates signed paths at the eBGP edge.

   Local policy on the eBGP edge MAY convey the validation state of a
   BGP signed path through normal local policy mechanisms, e.g. setting
   a BGP community, or modifying a metric value such as local-preference
   or MED.  Some MAY choose to use the large Local-Pref hammer.  Others
   MAY choose to let AS-Path rule and set their internal metric, which
   comes after AS-Path in the BGP decision process.

   Because of possible RPKI version skew, an AS Path which does not
   validate at router R0 might validate at R1.  Therefore, signed paths
   that are invalid and yet propagated (because they are chosen as best
   path) SHOULD have their signatures kept intact and MUST be signed if
   sent to external BGPsec speakers.

   This implies that updates which a speaker judges to be invalid MAY be
   propagated to iBGP peers.  Therefore, unless local policy ensures
   otherwise, a signed path learned via iBGP MAY be invalid.  If needed,
   the validation state should be signaled by normal local policy
   mechanisms such as communities or metrics.

   On the other hand, local policy on the eBGP edge might preclude iBGP
   or eBGP announcement of signed AS Paths which are invalid.

   A BGPsec speaker receiving a path SHOULD perform origin validation

   per [I-D.ietf-sidr-pfx-validate].

   If it is known that a BGPsec neighbor is not a transparent route
   server, and the router provides a knob to disallow a received pCount
   (prepend count, zero for transparent route servers) of zero, that
   knob SHOULD be applied.  Routers should default to this knob
   disallowing pCount 0.

   To prevent exposure of the internals of BGP Confederations [RFC5065],
   a BGPsec speaker which is a Member-AS of a Confederation MUST NOT
   sign updates sent to another Member-AS of the same Confederation.


8.  Notes

   For protection from attacks replaying BGP data on the order of a day
   or longer old, re-keying routers with new keys (previously)
   provisioned in the RPKI is sufficient.  For one procedure, see
   [I-D.rogaglia-sidr-bgpsec-rollover]

   Like the DNS, the global RPKI presents only a loosely consistent
   view, depending on timing, updating, fetching, etc.  Thus, one cache
   or router may have different data about a particular prefix than
   another cache or router.  There is no 'fix' for this, it is the
   nature of distributed data with distributed caches.

   Operators who manage certificates SHOULD have RPKI Ghostbuster
   Records (see [I-D.ietf-sidr-ghostbusters]), signed indirectly by End
   Entity certificates, for those certificates on which others' routing
   depends for certificate and/or ROA validation.

   Operators should be aware of impending algorithm transitions, which
   will be rare and slow-paced, see see
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-algorithm-agility].  They should work with their
   vendors to ensure support for new algorithms.

   As a router must evaluate certificates and ROAs which are time
   dependent, routers' clocks MUST be correct to a tolerance of
   approximately an hour.

   If a router has reason to believe its clock is seriously incorrect,
   e.g. it has a time earlier than 2011, it SHOULD NOT attempt to
   validate incoming updates.  It SHOULD defer validation until it
   believes it is within reasonable time tolerance.

   Servers should provide time service, such as [RFC5905], to client
   routers.
