                Two Dimensional IP Routing Architecture
                   draft-xu-rtgwg-twod-ip-routing-00

Abstract

   This document describes Two Dimensional IP (TwoD-IP) routing, a new
   Internet routing architecture which makes forwarding decisions based
   on both source address and destination address.  This presents a
   fundamental extension from the current Internet, which makes
   forwarding decisions based on the destination address, and provides
   shortest single-path routing towards destination.  Such extension
   provides rooms to solve fundamental problems of the past and foster
   great innovations in the future.

   We present the TwoD-IP routing framework and its two underpinning
   schemes.  The first is a new hardware-based forwarding table
   structure for TwoD-IP, FIST, which achieves line-speed lookup with
   acceptable storage space.  The second is a policy routing protocol
   that flexibly diverts traffic.

Internet-Draft        TwoD-IP Routing Architecture              Mar 2012


1.  Introduction

   Since IP routing took place, the current Internet has been making
   forwarding decisions based on destination addresses.  The
   destination-based routing system provides limited semantics with only
   a single path towards each destination.  Many services, such as
   multi-homing, multi-path and traffic engineering, face difficulties
   within the current Internet routing system.  Due to the important
   semantics of source address, recent years see increasing works on
   adding source addresses into routing controls.

   IP source routing [3] carries the routes in packet header.  However,
   IP source routing is disabled in most networks due to security
   reasons.  MPLS [4] uses label switching to manage traffic per-flow.
   However, MPLS raises scalability issues when the number of label
   switching paths (LSPs) increases [5].  What's more, many ISPs prefer
   pure-IP networks.

   In this draft, we describe Two Dimensional IP (TwoD-IP) routing,
   which makes forwarding decisions based on both source and destination
   addresses.  TwoD-IP routing presents a fundamental extension of the
   semantics from the current Internet.  The network will become more
   flexible, manageable, reliable, etc.  Such extension provides rooms
   to solve problems of the past and foster innovations in the future.

   TwoD-IP routing framework is divided into data plane and control
   plane.  In data plane, packet forwarding needs to check both source
   and destination addresses.  Though current TCAM-based forwarding
   table can match line speeds with parallel search over the table, with
   one more dimension in the table, the forwarding table will explode
   and exceed the maximum storage space of current TCAM.  We devise a
   new forwarding table structure for TwoD-IP, FIB Structure for TwoD-IP
   (FIST).  The new structure makes a separation between TCAM and SRAM,
   where TCAM contributes to fast lookup speeds and SRAM contributes to
   a larger memory space.  In the control plane, we devise a simple
   policy based routing protocol.  For the traffic of a customer network
   of an ISP, this policy routing protocol can flexibly divert the
   traffic from one edge router to another edge router.

   This document also presents the deployment issues and objectives of
   the TwoD-IP routing.

2.  Benefits of Introducing TwoD-IP Routing

   In this section, we list the use cases that can benefit from TwoD-IP
   routing.

2.1.  Multi-homing

   Multi-homing is prevalent among ISPs for better traffic distribution
   and reliability.  Traditionally, Provider Independent (PI) address is
   used.  Because PI address can not be aggregated by higher level ISPs,
   it will cause explosion of routing table.  To solve the problem,
   Provider Aggregatable (PA) address is proposed.  However, PA address
   complicates network configurations for ISP operators.  Besides, due
   to destination-based routing in traditional networks, PA address has
   difficulties when facing failures, i.e., the network has to re-
   compute a new path when failures happen.

                Figure 1: TwoD-IP routing for multi-homing

   For example, in Figure 1, assume a multi-homed site is connected to
   two ISPs: ISP1 and ISP2.  ISP1 has a prefix P1, and ISP2 has a prefix
   P2.  A host connect to the multi-homed site has two addresses,

   address A that can be aggregated into P1, and address B that can be
   aggregated into P2.  With TwoD-IP routing, the multi-homed site can
   deliver the traffic from A towards the Internet to ISP1, and deliver
   the traffic from B towards the Internet to ISP2.  If the host is
   using address A, and the link l1 or l3 fails.  Then the host can
   immediately detect the failure, then switch to address B, and
   continue to communicate with the Internet via ISP2.  With TwoD-IP,
   the host does not have to wait for routing convergence in the multi-
   homed site when failures happen.

2.2.  Load Balancing

   Compared to destination-based routing, TwoD-IP routing can manipulate
   traffic in a finer-grained granularity.  Such that TwoD-IP can
   achieve better traffic distribution.  For example, in Figure 2,
   assume that there are 5 hosts that are communicating with the same
   server at 10Mbps.  Our goal is to minimize the maximum link
   utilization over the network.  Within destination-based routing,
   traffic towards the same destination has to travel along the same
   path in the network.  Thus the best traffic distribution is to let
   all traffic take the north route via router b, and the Min-max link
   utilization is 83.3%.

          +-----+   |      |        +-----+         |

          +-----+


               Figure 2: TwoD-IP routing for load balancing

   With TwoD-IP routing, we can let the traffic of three hosts (e.g.,
   Host1, Host2 and Host3) take the north route via b, and let the
   traffic of the other two hsots (e.g., Host4 and Host5) take the south
   route via d.  Thus the Min-max link utilization is only 50.0%.

2.3.  Diagnosis

   In Figure 3, assume a network has four routers: a, b, c and d.  The
   operator wants to monitor the status of the link between b and d.
   Thus the operator sets up a monitor at router a, and sends probe
   packets to d.  Theoretically, the probe packets will flow on the
   shortest path, i.e., a-b-d.  However, the network provides traffic
   engineering capabilities.  If there is congestion on the link between
   b and d, and router b moves the traffic towards d to the north path
   via c.  Thus, the probe packets will flow on the path a-b-c-d, which
   does not include the link between b and d.


                                     +------+
                             +-------+  c   +-----+
                             |       +------+     |
                             |                    |
                             |                    |
        +------+          +--+---+            +---+--+
        |  a   +----------+  b   +------------+   d  |
        +------+          +------+            +------+


               Figure 3: TwoD-IP routing for Diagnosability

   With TwoD-IP routing, router b can identify the probe packets from a
   towards d, and deliver them directly to router d.  Thus the link
   between b and d can be easily monitored.

2.4.  Policy Routing

   Assume in an ISP network, ISP operator wants that the traffic from
   source address A towards destination address B passes by router C.
   With TwoD-IP routing, routers make forwarding decisions based on both
   destination and source addresses, thus can easily identify the
   traffic from A towards B, and divert it to the next hop towards C.

2.5.  Others

   Besides the above-mentioned use cases, TwoD-IP routing is beneficial
   in many other use-cases.  We list the other use-cases briefly.

   o  Reliability: TwoD-IP provides multiple paths towards destination,
      rather than the shortest path only.  When one path breaks down,
      routers can immediately switch to another path.

   o  Multi-path: TwoD-IP can forward packets towards the same
      destination, and from different sources to different next hops.

Internet-Draft        TwoD-IP Routing Architecture              Mar 2012


      If a host has multiple source addresses, the host will have
      multiple paths towards the same destination.

   o  Security: Traditional network pushes the security devices to the
      border routers, the intermediate network just delivers the
      packets.  With TwoD-IP, intermediate routers also have source
      checking functionality.  Thus, the whole network rather than the
      border network, can defense attacks.

   o  Measurability: With TwoD-IP, ISP operators can explicitly control
      the routing paths of probe packets.  Thus the number of monitors,
      and the additional traffic caused by the probe packets, can be
      reduced [6].

3.  Framework

   Similar with traditional routing, TwoD-IP routing can be separated
   into two parts: data plane and control plane.

3.1.  Data Plane

   Data plane contains the forwarding table, that decides what to do
   when a packet arrives.  Different with traditional destination-based
   routing, each entry in the TwoD-IP routing forwarding table is a
   3-tuple: {destination address, source address, next hop}.  When a
   packet arrives, routers extract both destination and source addresses
   from the packet, then lookup the forwarding table, and output a
   matched entry.  Finally, routers will forward the packet to the next
   hop associated with the matched entry.

   With a new dimension, the size of forwarding table will increase to
   be O(N^2) (where N is the size of source/destination address space),
   which is too large for current TCAM-based storage to accomodate.  To
   avoid forwarding table explosion, we design a new forwarding table
   structure in Section 4.

3.2.  Control Plane

   In traditional routing, the control plane is concerned with the
   network status, e.g., network topology.  Within TwoD-IP routing, the
   control plane is concerned with both network status and user demands.
   TwoD-IP routing not only provides basic connectivity service, but
   also satisfies kinds of user demands, e.g., policy routing, multi-
   path and traffic engineering.  TwoD-IP routing protocol has two
   components:

   o  Destination-based routing protocol: To be compatible with
      traditional routing (especially when most networks only support
      destination-based routing), TwoD-IP routing protocol should
      support destination-based routing.  Such that ISPs can provide the
      same connectivity service, while upgrading routers with TwoD-IP
      functionality.  To provide better connectivity services,
      destination-based routing protocol should respond instantly to the
      changes of network topology.

   o  Source-related routing protocol: Combined with source addresses,
      TwoD-IP routing can make better forwarding decisions for users.
      Source-related routing protocols focus on providing services that
      are related with source addresses.  They may need to collect
      demands from users, and compute the routing table to satisfy these
      demands.  Depending on the specific user demands, some source-
      related routing protocols need real-time updates, while others do

      not.  The newly designed source-related routing protocols should
      be:

      *  Consistent, they should be consistent with other routing
         protocols, including the destination-based routing protocol and
         other new source-related routing protocols;

      *  Efficient, they should not bring lots of additional overheads
         to the network.

4.  Forwarding Table Design

4.1.  Design Goals

   The forwarding table stores a set of 3-tuple rules, {pd, ps, nh},
   where pd is a destination prefix, ps is a source prefix, and nh
   indicates the next hop.  When a packet arrives, if its destination
   address matches pd according to LMF (longest match first) rule among
   all rules, and its source address matches ps according to LMF rule
   among all rules that are associated with pd.  Then the router will
   forward the packet to the next hop nh.

   The new forwarding table should satisfy the following requirements.

   o  Storage requirement: The new forwarding table should not cause
      forwarding table explosion problem.  Current storage technology
      should be able to accomodate the table.

   o  Speed requirement: The new forwarding table should match line-
      speeds.

4.2.  Forwarding Table Structure

   We design a new TwoD-IP forwarding table structure, called FIST.  As
   shown in Figure 4, FIST consists of four parts.

   o  Destination table: It resides in TCAM, and stores the destination
      prefixes.  Each destination prefix in destination table
      corresponds to a row number.

   o  Source table: It resides in TCAM, and stores the source prefixes.
      Each source prefix in source table corresponds to a column number.

   o  Two Dimensional Table (TD-table): It is a two dimensional array
      that resides in SRAM.  Given a row and column numbers, we can find
      a cell in TD-table.  Each cell in TD-table stores an index value,
      that can be mapped to a next hop.

   o  Mapping table: It resides in SRAM, and maps index values to next
      hops.

   For example, in Figure 4, the destination table contains 5
   destination prefixes, and the destination prefix 101* corresponds to
   a row number 2.  The source table contains 4 source prefixes and a
   default one (can be see as "****"), the source prefix 11**
   corresponds to a column number 4.  The TD-table has 5 rows and 5
   columns, the cell that is in the 2nd row and the 4th column has index
   value 2.  In the mapping table, we can see that the index value 2 is
   related with the next hop 1.0.0.2.

   If destination prefix pd outputs row number n, and source prefix ps
   outputs column number m, we use (pd, ps) to denote a cell in the nth
   row and mth column of the TD-table.

4.3.  Lookup Action

   When a packet arrives at a router, the lookup action is as follows.

   1.  Extract the destination address d and source address s from the
       packet;

   2.  Perform the following two operations in parallel:

       *  Lookup the destination address d in the destination table
          using the LMF rule, and output the row number n;

       *  Lookup the source address s in the source table using the LMF
          rule, and output the column number m;

   3.  Lookup the cell that is in the nth row and mth column of the TD-
       table, and output the index value v;

   4.  Lookup v in the mapping table, and ouput the corresponding next
       hop;

   5.  Forward the packet to the next hop.

   The 2nd step takes one TCAM clock cycle to match both d and s, and
   one SRAM clock cycle to get the row/column number.  The 3rd step
   takes one SRAM clock cycle to get the index value, the 4th step takes
   one SRAM clock cycle to get the next hop.  Thus, the lookup speed is
   one TCAM clock cycle plus three SRAM clock cycles.  Beside, the
   lookup process can be pipelined to achieve higher speed.

4.4.  Update Action

   Although FIST can reduce TCAM storage space, and achieve fast lookup
   speed, it also faces new challenges.  The challenges are caused by
   performing LMF rule on source addresses.  Assume a packet should
   match destination prefix pd, and source prefix ps.  However, if the
   source table contains a source prefix ps' that also mathces the
   packet and is longer than ps, then the packet will match (pd, ps')
   within FIST.

   For example, if the forwarding table on a router is shown in
   Figure 4, and a packet with destination address of 1011 and source
   address of 1111 arrives on the router.  According to the matching
   rule, destination prefix 101* is matched first, and source prefix
   11** should be matched.  However, within FIST, destination prefix
   101* and source prefix 111* are matched.  But the cell (101*, 111*)
   is empty.

   To resolve the confliction, we should pre-compute and fill the empty
   cell with appropriate index value.  For example, in Figure 4, we
   should fill the cell (101*, 111*) with the index value 2, that is the
   index value of cell (101*, 11**).  We will discuss the update action
   in the next version of this document.

4.5.  Scalability Improvements

   In Section 4.2, we design the FIST structure, where each destination
   prefix corresponds to a row, and each source prefix corresponds to a
   column.  Considering the large number of address prefixes, we can
   make improvements in the following two aspects:

   o  Not every destination prefix need to be mapped to a row, because
      ISPs only need to divert traffic for part of the destination
      prefixes.  The destination table of FIST should be divided into
      two parts, each destination prefixes in the first part points to a
      row and each destination prefix in the second part points directly
      to an index value.

   o  Different destination/source prefixes can be mapped to the same
      row/column, because ISPs may implement the same policy on
      different prefixes.  For example, ISPs wants to divert the traffic
      of some customer network, which has multiple prefixes, to another
      path.

5.  Routing Protocol Design

5.1.  Protocol Overview

   In this section, to illustrate TwoD-IP routing protocol, we design a
   simple policy routing protocol.  The routing protocol provides a
   flexible tool for ISPs to divert traffic (that is from some customer
   networks towards the foreign Internet) to another path.

          +---------+     |    )  (               |     |          |
          |0.0.1.*  |     |   )    (              |     | 1.0.2.*  |
          |         +-----+-B1       I1---I2---E1-+-----+          |
          +---------+     +-----------------------+     +----------+

      The second customer


                Figure 5: A simple policy routing protocol

   For example, in Figure 5, the ISP has two customer networks, the
   first customer network has domain number of 0 and one prefix of
   0.0.0.*, the second customer network has domain number of 1 and one
   prefix of 0.0.1.*.  The first customer network is conneted to
   provider edge router (PE router) B0 and the second customer network
   is connected to PE router B1.  The ISP is connected to the foreign
   Internet through two edge routers, E0 and E1, besides, it has four
   intermediate routers (P router), I0, I1, I2 and I3.  The shortest
   paths from the customer networks to the foreign Internet are B0-I0-
   I3-E0 and B1-I0-I3-E0.  However, due to congestion on E0, the ISP
   operator wants to divert the traffic of the second customer network
   (behind B1) to the path through E1, i.e., B1-I0-I1-I2-E1.

   We design the protocol based on the extension of OSPF [2], which can
   disseminate the information within the network.  To illustrate the
   protocol, we first clarify the following aspects.

   o  Through e-BGP, edge routers know the prefixes of foreign Internet,
      e.g., both E0 and E1 know that there are three foreign Internet
      prefixes, 1.0.0.*, 1.0.1.*, 1.0.2.*;

Internet-Draft        TwoD-IP Routing Architecture              Mar 2012


   o  Through OSPF, PE routers know the prefixes of the customer
      networks behind them, e.g., B0 knows that prefix 0.0.0.* belong to
      the first customer network in Figure 5.  Besides, PE routers know
      the customer domain number of the customer networks behind them,
      e.g, B0 knows that the customer domain number of the first
      customer network is 0.  Through manual configuration or automatic
      selection (e.g., selecting the router that has lower utilization),
      edge routers know the preferences of customer networks on edge
      routers, e.g., B1 knows that the second customer network in
      Figure 5 prefers to pass by E1.

   With these preconditions, each edge router can announce the foreign
   Internet prefixes combined with its own router identification to the
   network, each PE router can announce the customer prefixes combined
   with the corresponding customer domain number, PE routers are also
   responsible for announcing the preference of customer networks on
   edge routers.  When receiving all necessary information, both PE and
   P routers will construct the routing table, which can be used to
   generate the forwarding table.

5.2.  Router Actions

   We first define three types of messages.

   Announce(Prefixes, Router_ID):  Edge routers send this message, to
      announce the binding relations between foreign IP perfixes and the
      edge router identification (can be represented by the IP address
      of the edge router).  This message indicates that traffic can
      reach the foreign Internet through the edge router.

   Bind(Prefixes, Domain_Number):  PE routers send this message, to
      announce the binding relations between customer network IP
      prefixes and customer domain number.  This message indicates that
      the customer network IP prefixes belong to the cusomter network
      that owns the Domain_Number.

   Pref(Domain_Number, Router_ID):  PE routers send this message, to
      announces the preference of a customer network on an edge router.
      This message indicates that the customer network that owns the
      Domain_Number prefers to pass by the edge router that owns the
      Router_ID.

   Then the actions on different types of routers are as follows.

   Edge Routers:  Edge routers have to send Announce(Prefixes,
      Router_ID) to announce the foreign Internet prefixes to the
      network.  For example, in Figure 5, E0 will send Announce(1.0.0.*,
      E0), Announce(1.0.1.*, EO) and Announce(1.0.2.*, EO).  E1 will



Xu, et al.              Expires September 2, 2012              [Page 16]

Internet-Draft        TwoD-IP Routing Architecture              Mar 2012


      send Announce(1.0.0.*, E1), Announce(1.0.1.*, E1) and
      Announce(1.0.2.*, E1).

   PE Routers:

      1.  PE routers have to send Bind(Prefixes, Domain_Number) to
          announce the customer network prefixes to the network.  For
          example, B0 will send Bind(0.0.0.*, 0), B1 will send
          Bind(0.0.1.*, 1).

      2.  PE routers have to send Pref(Domain_Number, Router_ID) to
          announce the preference of the cusomter network on an edge
          routers.  For example, B1 will send Pref(1, E1).

      3.  After receiving Announce(Prefixes, Router_ID) from edge
          routers, PE routers should construct the routing table.

   Intermediate Routers:  After receiving Announce(Prefixes, Router_ID)
      from edge routers, Bind(Prefixes, Domain_Number) and
      Pref(Domain_Number, Router_ID) from PE routers, P routers should
      construct the routing table.

5.3.  TwoD-IP Routing Table Construction

   Receiving the necessary information (including customer network
   prefixes, foreign Internet prefixes and preferences of customer
   networks), both PE and P routers should construct the routing table.
   Edge routers do not need to construct the routing table, unless they
   also belong to PE/P routers.

   The routing table consists of two parts, the first part (traditional
   routing table) is constructed based on OSPF, the second part (TwoD-IP
   routing table) is construted based on our TwoD-IP policy routing
   protocol.  When forwarding a packet to the destination, routers first
   lookup the TwoD-IP routing table, if there does not exist a matched
   entry, routers will lookup the traditional routing table.  We focus
   on the construction of TwoD-IP routing table in this document.  For
   simplicity, we assume that there are only threee fields in each entry
   of TwoD-IP routing table, i.e., (Destination, Source, Next hop).
   Both the destination and source fields represent an IP prefix, the
   next hop field denotes the outgoing router interface to use (see
   Section 11 of [1] for more details).

   The routing table construction process is as follows.

   1.  For each received Pref(Domain_Number, Router_ID), lookup the
       traditional table, and obtain the next hop towards the edge
       router that owns Router_ID.  We use Next_Hop to denote the

Internet-Draft        TwoD-IP Routing Architecture              Mar 2012


       obtained next hop.

   2.  For each foreign Internet prefix (Foreign_Prefix), lookup the
       traditional table, and obtain the next hop towards the
       Foreign_Prefix.  We use Next_Hop' to denote the obtained next
       hop.

   3.  If Next_Hop!=Next_Hop', for each customer network prefix
       (Customer_Prefix) that belongs to the customer network that own
       Domain_Number, we add a new entry (Foreign_Prefix,
       Customer_Prefix, Next_Hop) to the TwoD-IP routing table.

   For example, we continue the example in Figure 5, the TwoD-IP routing
   table on the P router I0 is shown in Figure 6.


           Destination          Source            Next hop

6.  Deployment

   TwoD-IP should support incremental deployment, and during deployment,
   the following requirements should be satisfied.

   Backward compatibility:  During deployment, reachability should be
      guaranteed, and loops should be avoided.

   Incentive:  After deploying partial routers, ISPs should be able to
      see visible gains, e.g., their policies are implemented, traffic
      distribution is improved or security level is enhanced.

   Effectivity:  The deployment should maximize the benefits for ISPs,
      e.g., the deployment sequence should be carefully scheduled, such
      that ISPs can obtain maximum benefits in each step.

7.  Implementation Status

   We have developed a prototype of the TwoD-IP policy routing protocol
   (see Section 5) on a commercial router, and set up small scale tests
   under VegaNet [7], a high performance virtualized testbed.

   Currently, we are developing the prototype of TwoD-IP router, that
   uses the FIST forwarding table strucute (see Section 4.2).

8.  Security Considerations

   TwoD-IP routing will enhance the security level of the networks,
   because routers will check source addresses, which is an important
   identity of the senders.  Distributed attack defenses will be an
   important topic of TwoD-IP routing, because source checking
   functionality is deployed deeper in the network.

   However, TwoD-IP routing protocols must be carefully designed, to
   avoid to be used by hackers.
