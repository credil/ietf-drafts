1.  Introduction

   The Diameter Base specification [2] offers security protection
   between neighboring Diameter peers and mandates that either TLS (for
   TCP), DTLS (for SCTP), or IPsec is used.  These security protocols
   offer a wide range of security properties, including entity
   authentication, data-origin authentication, integrity,
   confidentiality protection and replay protection.  They also support
   a large number of cryptographic algorithms, algorithm negotiation,
   and different types of credentials.

   The need to also offer additional security protection of AVPs between
   non-neighboring Diameter nodes was recognized very early in the work
   on Diameter.  This lead to work on Diameter security using the
   Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [3].  Due to lack of deployment
   interest at that time (and the complexity of the developed solution)
   the specification was, however, never completed.

   In the meanwhile Diameter had received a lot of deployment interest
   from the cellular operator community and because of the
   sophistication of those deployments the need for protecting Diameter
   AVPs between non-neighboring nodes re-surfaced.  Since early 2000
   (when the work on [3] was discontinued) the Internet community had
   seen advances in cryptographic algorithms (for example, authenticated
   encryption algorithms) and new security building blocks were
   developed.

   This document collects requirements for developing a solution to
   protect Diameter AVPs.

2.  Terminology

   The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT',
   'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this
   specification are to be interpreted as described in [1].

   This document re-uses terminology from the Diameter base
   specification [2].

   In the figures below we use the symbols 'AVP' and '{AVP}k'.  AVP
   refers to an unprotected AVP and {AVP}k refers to an AVP that
   experiences security protection (using key "k") without further
   distinguishing between integrity and confidentiality protection.

3.  Security Threats

   The follow description aims to illustrate various security threats
   that raise the need for protecting Diameter Attribute Value Pairs
   (AVPs).  Figure 1 illustrates an example Diameter topology where a
   Diameter clients want to interact with the example.com home domain.
   To interconnect the two visited networks a AAA interconnection
   provider, labeled as AAA Broker, is used.

                  Figure 1: Example Diameter Deployment.

   Eavesdropping:  Some Diameter applications carry information that is
      only intended for consumption by end points, either by the
      Diameter client or by the Diameter server but not by
      intermediaries.  As an example, consider the Diameter EAP
      application [4] that allows keying material for the protection of
      air interface between the end device and the network access server
      to be carried from the Diameter server to the Diameter client
      (using the EAP-Master-Session-Key AVP).  The content of the EAP-
      Master-Session-Key AVP would benefit from protection against
      eavesdropping by intermediaries.  Other AVPs might also carry
      sensitive personal data that, when collected by intermediaries,
      allow for traffic analysis.

      In context of the deployment shown in Figure 1 the adversary
      could, for example, be in the AAA broker network.

   Injection and Manipulation:  The Diameter base specification mandates
      security protection between neighboring nodes but Diameter agents
      may be compromised or misconfigured and inject/manipulate AVPs.
      To detect such actions additional security protection needs to be
      applied at the Diameter layer.

      Nodes that could launch such an attack are any Diameter agents
      along the end-to-end communication path.

   Impersonation:  Imagine a case where a Diameter message from
      Example.net contains information claiming to be from Example.org.
      This would either require strict verification at the edge of the
      AAA broker network or cryptographic assurance at the Diameter
      layer to provent a successful impersonation attack.

      Any Diameter realm could launch such an attack aiming for
      financial benefits or to disrupt service availability.

4.  Scenarios for Diameter AVP-Level Protection

   This scenario outlines a number of cases for deploying security
   protection of individual Diameter AVPs.

   In the first scenario, shown in Figure 2, end-to-end security
   protection is provided between the Diameter client and the Diameter
   server.  Diameter AVPs exchanged between these two Diameter nodes are
   protected.


   +--------+                                                +--------+
   |Diameter| AVP, {AVP}k                                    |Diameter|
   |Client  +-----------------........... -------------------+Server  |
   +--------+                                                +--------+


          Figure 2: End-to-End Diameter AVP Security Protection.

   In the second scenario, shown in Figure 3, a Diameter proxy acts on
   behalf of the Diameter client with regard to security protection.  It
   applies security protection to outgoing Diameter AVPs and verifies
   incoming AVPs.


   +--------+     +--------+                                 +--------+
   |Diameter| AVP |Diameter|   AVP, {AVP}k                   |Diameter|
   |Client  +-----+Proxy A +---------- .......... -----------+Server  |
   +--------+     +--------+                                 +--------+


         Figure 3: Middle-to-End Diameter AVP Security Protection.

   In the third scenario shown in Figure 4 a Diameter proxy acts on
   behalf of the Diameter server.


   +--------+                                 +--------+     +--------+
   |Diameter| AVP, {AVP}k                     |Diameter| AVP |Diameter|
   |Client  +-----------------........... ----+Proxy D +-----+Server  |
   +--------+                                 +--------+     +--------+


         Figure 4: End-to-Middle Diameter AVP Security Protection.

   The fourth and the final scenario (see Figure 5) is a combination of
   the end-to-middle and the middle-to-end scenario shown in Figure 4
   and in Figure 3.  From a deployment point of view this scenario is
   easier to accomplish for two reasons: First, Diameter clients and
   Diameter servers remain unmodified.  This ensures that no
   modifications are needed to the installed Diameter infrastructure.
   Second, key management is also simplified since fewer number of key
   pairs need to be negotiated and provisioned.

       Figure 5: Middle-to-Middle Diameter AVP Security Protection.

   Various security threats are mitigated by selectively applying
   security protection for individual Diameter AVPs.  Without protection
   there is the possibility for password sniffing, confidentiality
   violation, AVP insertion, deletion or modification.  Additionally,
   applying digital signature offers non-repudiation capabilities; a
   feature not yet available in today's Diameter deployment.
   Modification of certain Diameter AVPs may not necessarily be the act
   of malicious behavior but could also be the result of
   misconfiguration.  An over-aggressively configured firewalling
   Diameter proxy may also remove certain AVPs.  In most cases data
   origin authentication and integrity protection of AVPs will provide
   most benefits for existing deployments with minimal overhead and
   (potentially) operating in a full-backwards compatible manner.

5.  Requirements

   Requirement #1:  Solutions MUST support an extensible set of
      cryptographic algorithms.

         Motivation: Crypto-agility is the ability of a protocol to
         adapt to evolving cryptographic algorithms and security
         requirements.  This may include the provision of a modular
         mechanism to allow cryptographic algorithms to be updated
         without substantial disruption to deployed implementations.

   Requirement #2:  Solutions MUST support confidentiality, integrity,
      and data-origin authentication.  Solutions for integrity
      protection MUST work in a backwards-compatible way with existing
      Diameter applications.

   Requirement #3:  Solutions MUST support replay protection.  Any
      Diameter node has an access to network time and thus can
      synchronise their clocks.

   Requirement #4:  Solutions MUST support the ability to delegate
      security functionality to another entity

         Motivation: As described in Section 4 the ability to let a
         Diameter proxy to perform security services on behalf of all
         clients within the same administrative domain is important for



Tschofenig, et al.       Expires April 24, 2014                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         Diameter AVP Level Security          October 2013


         incremental deployability.  The same applies to the other
         communication side where a load balancer terminates security
         services for the servers it interfaces.

   Requirement #5:  Solutions MUST be able to selectively apply their
      cryptographic protection to certain Diameter AVPs.

         Motivation: Some Diameter applications assume that certain AVPs
         are added, removed, or modified by intermediaries.  As such, it
         MUST be possible to apply security protection selectively.

   Requirement #6:  Solutions MUST recommend a mandatory-to-implement
      cryptographic algorithm.

         Motivation: For interoperability purposes it is beneficial to
         have a mandatory-to-implement cryptographic algorithm specified
         (unless profiles for specific usage environments specify
         otherwise).

   Requirement #7:  Solutions MUST support symmetric keys and asymmetric
      keys.

         Motivation: Symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic algorithms
         provide different security services.  Asymmetric algorithms,
         for example, allow non-repudiation services to be offered.

   Requirement #8:  A solution for dynamic key management MUST be
      included in the overall solution framework.  However, it is
      assumed that no "new" key management protocol needs to be
      developed; instead existing ones are re-used, if at all possible.
      Rekeying could be triggered by (a) management actions and (b)
      expiring keying material.

   Requirement #9:  The ability to statically provisioned keys
      (symmetric as well as asymmetric keys) has to be supported to
      simplify management for small-scale deployments that typically do
      not have a back-end network management infrastructure.

6.  Open Issues

   Open Issue #1:  Capability/Policy Discovery: This document talks
      about selectively protecting Diameter AVPs between different
      Diameter nodes.  A Diameter node has to be configured such that it
      applies security protection to a certain number of AVPs.  A number
      of policy related questions arise: What keying material should be
      used so that the intended recipient is also able to verify it?
      What AVPs shall be protected so that the result is not rejected by
      the recipient?  In case of confidentiality protection the Diameter

      node encrypting AVPs needs to know ahead of time what other node
      is intended to decrypt them.  Should the list of integrity
      protected AVP be indicated in the protected payload itself (or is
      it known based on out-of-band information)?  Is this policy /
      capability information assumed to be established out-of-band
      (manually) or is there a protocol mechanism to distribute this
      information?

   Open Issue #2:  Command-Line Support: Should solutions allow the
      provisioning of long-term shared symmetric credentials via a
      command-line interface / text file?  This allows easier management
      for small-scale deployments.

7.  Security Considerations

   This entire document focused on the discussion of new functionality
   for securing Diameter AVPs selectively between non-neighboring nodes.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require actions by IANA.
