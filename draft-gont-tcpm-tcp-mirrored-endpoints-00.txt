          Processing of TCP segments with Mirrored End-points
             draft-gont-tcpm-tcp-mirrored-endpoints-00.txt

Abstract

   This document describes a problem found in some popular
   implementations regarding the processing of TCP segments in which the
   local endpoint is equal to the remote endpoint.  Additionally, it
   formally updates RFC 793 clarifying how this scenario should be
   handled.

Internet-Draft    TCP segments with mirrored endpoints        March 2012


1.  Introduction

   Some systems have been found to be unable to process TCP segments in
   which the source endpoint {Source Address, Source Port} is the same
   than the destination end-point {Destination Address, Destination
   Port}.  Such TCP segments have been reported to cause malfunction of
   a number of implementations [CERT1996], and have been exploited in
   the past to perform Denial of Service (DoS) attacks [Meltman1997].
   While these packets are very very unlikely to exist in legitimate
   scenarios, TCP should nevertheless be able to process them without
   the need of any "extra" code.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Updating RFC 793

   TCP MUST be able to gracefully handle the case where the source end-
   point (IP Source Address, TCP Source Port) is the same as the
   destination end-point (IP Destination Address, TCP Destination Port).

      A SYN segment in which the source end-point {Source Address,
      Source Port} is the same as the destination end-point {Destination
      Address, Destination Port} will result in a "simultaneous open"
      scenario, such as the one described in page 32 of RFC 793
      [RFC0793].  Therefore, those TCP implementations that correctly
      handle simultaneous opens should already be prepared to handle
      these unusual TCP segments.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.  The RFC Editor is requested to
   remove this section before publishing this document as an RFC.


4.  Security Considerations

   This document describes a problem found in some popular
   implementations regarding the processing of TCP instances in which
   the local and the remote TCP endpoints are the equal.  It formally
   updates RFC 793, clarifying how such packets should be handled, thus
   helping prevent unexpected behaviors in host implementations.
