            Advertising per-node administrative tags in OSPF
                   draft-hegde-ospf-node-admin-tag-00

Abstract

   This document describes an extension to OSPF protocol [RFC2328] to
   add an optional operational capability, that allows tagging and
   grouping of the nodes in an OSPF domain.  This allows
   simplification,ease of management and control over route and path
   selection based on configured policies.

   This document describes the protocol extensions to disseminate per-
   node admin-tags to the OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 protocols.

1.  Introduction

   This document provides mechanisms to advertise per-node
   administrative tags in the OSPF router information LSA [RFC4970].  In
   certain path-selection applications like for example in traffic-
   engineering or LFA backup selection there is a need to tag the nodes
   based on their roles in the network and have policies to prefer or
   prune a certain group of nodes.

2.  Applicability

   For the purpose of advertising per-node administrative tags within
   OSPF a new TLV is proposed.  Because path selection is a functional
   set which applies both to TE and non-TE applications, this new TLV is
   carried in the Router Information LSA [RFC4970]

3.  Administrative Tag TLV

Internet-DrafAdvertising per-node administrative tags in OS October 2013


   An administrative Tag is a 32-bit integer value that can be used to
   identify a group of nodes in the OSPF domain.

   The new TLV defined will be carried within an RI LSA for OSPFV2 and
   OSPFV3.  Router information LSA [RFC4970] can have link,area or AS
   level flooding scope.  Choosing the flooding scope to flood the group
   tags are defined by the policies and is a local matter.

   The TLV specifies one or more administrative tag values.  An OSPF
   node advertises the set of groups it is part of in the OSPF domain.
   (for example, all PE-nodes are configured with certain tag value, all
   P-nodes are configured with a different tag value in a domain).

4.  TLV format

4.1.  OSPF per-node administrative tag TLV

   The format of the TLVs within the body of an RI LSA is the same as
   the format used by the Traffic Engineering Extensions to OSPF
   [RFC3630].

   The LSA payload consists of one or more nested Type/Length/Value
   (TLV) triplets.  The format of each TLV is:




   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Type                          | Length                        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |           Administrative Tag #1                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |           Administrative Tag #2                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   //                                                             //
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |           Administrative Tag #N                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

              Figure 1: OSPF per-node Administrative Tag TLV


   Type : TBA

   Length: A 16-bit field that indicates the length of the value portion
   in octets and will be a multiple of 4 octets dependent on the number
   of tags advertised.

Internet-DrafAdvertising per-node administrative tags in OS October 2013


   Value: A sequence of multiple 4 octets defining the administrative
   tags.

4.2.  Ordering of tags

   The semantics of the tag order are implementation-dependent.  That
   is, there is no implied meaning to the ordering of the tags that
   indicates a certain operation or set of operations that need to be
   performed based on the ordering.

   Each tag SHOULD be treated as an independent identifier that MAY be
   used in policy to perform a policy action.  Whether or not tag A
   precedes or succeeds tag B SHOULD not change the meaning of the tag
   set.

5.  Applications

   Increased deployment of Loop Free Alternates (LFA) as defined in
   [RFC5286] has exposed some limitations.New draft Operation management
   of Loop Free Alternates [I-D.litkowski-rtgwg-lfa-manageability]
   proposes refinements to address those limitations.

   One of the proposed refinements is to be able to group the nodes in
   IGP domain with administrative tags and engineer the LFA based on
   configured policies.

   The mechanisms outlined in this document helps provide the capability
   to advertise group tags within OSPF protocol in order to achieve
   policy based LFA selection.

   The policies configured on each node can then make use of these tags
   to prefer or prune certain group of nodes for selecting LFAs.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any further security issues other
   than those discussed in [RFC2328] and [RFC5340].

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains the registry for the TLVs.  OSPF Administrative Tags
   will require one new type code for the TLV defined in this document.
