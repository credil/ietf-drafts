2.  Introduction

   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [I-D.ietf-core-coap] is a
   RESTful protocol for constrained nodes and networks.

   Often, a client first learns about a resource through the link format
   [I-D.ietf-core-link-format].  The link format only provides basic
   information, for example the resource URL.  However, it would be good
   if the client could get more extensive information on the resources
   when required.  This document defines a profile description format,
   which can be used to signal several parameters about resources and
   their servers.

   One of the main features of the CoAP protocol is the ability to
   include CoAP options.  These options can be either elective or
   critical.  A message with an unsupported critical option will be
   rejected, whereas unsupported elective options will be ignored.

   Even though it is well defined how the server must respond to
   unsupported options, it is useful for the client to know which
   options are supported in advance.  In this way, it can determine
   which options are viable to use in a transaction, and which features
   cannot be exploited.  This specification allows signalling of the
   supported options by the resource.

   Another important feature of a CoAP server is which content formats
   it supports.  CoAP provides a mechanism for the client to indicate to
   the server which content format the client prefers.  The use of
   profiles allows signalling what content formats are supported by the
   server, so that the client can decide which content type it prefers.

   It is anticipated that more profile descriptions will become
   available in the future.

Internet-Draft       CoAP Profile Description Format        October 2012


3.  Obtaining the profile information

   Similar to the link format from [RFC6690], the profile interface uses
   a well-known resource URI as a pointer to the profile description.

   The host component of the URI of the profile description should be
   equal to the URI of the associated resource, whereas the path
   component begins with ".well-known" as specified in [RFC5785].  The
   complete path component equals ".well-known/profile".

   For example, if the client wants to get the profile description of a
   server with URI "www.example.org", it can send a GET request for
   "coap://www.example.org/.well-known/profile".  In this case the
   server SHOULD respond with the profile details of all resources on
   the server.  The server MAY use the reserved resource name "." to
   provide a default profile.  This default profile applies to all
   resources that are not specifically listed in the profile (e.g.
   because they do not have their individual profile) and describes the
   general CoAP capabilities of the server.  If a resource has its own
   profile, then this profile MUST be used and the default profile field
   MUST be ignored.

   If only the profile of a particular resource is needed, the client
   SHOULD send a GET request including the "path" URI-query.  If the
   resource has no specific profile the server MUST respond with the
   default profile.

   For example, the profile of the sensor "coap://www.example.org/s" can
   be acquired with a GET to:
   "coap://www.example.org/.well-known/profile?path=s".

   Section 5 covers this in more detail.

4.  The Profile Format

   The profile description is formatted as a JSON document.  It consists
   of several profile fields, each of which has associated parameters.

4.1.  The path "path" profile field

   The "path" profile field contains the Uri-Path component associated
   with the resource.  It can be used to filter on certain profile
   properties, as described in Section 5.

4.2.  The options "op" profile field

   The options "op" profile field contains a list of options that are
   supported by a resource.  It has the format depicted in Figure 1,
   where op1, op2, ... are integers representing the option numbers of
   the supported options, as defined in [I-D.ietf-core-coap] and/or
   through IANA.  The option numbers MUST appear in numerical order,
   starting with the lowest number.

                             "op":[op1,op2,...]

                           Figure 1: "op" syntax

   When including the "op" profile field in the profile description of a
   resource, all option numbers of the CoAP options supported by that
   resource MUST be included.  Options that are not supported by the
   resource MUST NOT be included in the "op" profile field.

   If the "op" profile field is available, the receiving party SHALL
   assume a non-listed option is not supported by the associated
   resource.

4.3.  The Content-Formats "cf" profile field

   The content formats "cf" profile field indicates which content
   formats are supported.  It has the format depicted in Figure 2, where
   cf1, cf2, ... are integers representing the numbers of the supported
   content formats, as defined in [I-D.ietf-core-coap] and/or through
   IANA.  The content format numbers MUST appear in numerical order,
   starting with the lowest number.

                             "cf":[cf1,cf2,...]

                           Figure 2: "cf" syntax

   When including the "cf" profile field in the profile description of a
   resource, all content formats of the CoAP options supported by that



Greevenbosch, et al.     Expires April 25, 2013                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       CoAP Profile Description Format        October 2012


   resource MUST be included.  Content formats that are not supported by
   the resource MUST NOT be included in the "cf" profile field.

   If the "cf" profile field is available, the receiving party SHALL
   assume a non-listed content format is not supported by the associated
   resource.

4.4.  The Block-Sizes "b1s" and "b2s" profile fields

   The block sizes "b1s" and "b2s" profile fields indicate which block
   sizes are supported for Block1 and Block2 options when block-wise
   transfer is used.  It has the format depicted in Figure 3, where
   b1s1, b1s2, ... are three-bit unsigned integers indicating the size
   of a block to the power of two.  Thus block size = 2**(b1 + 4).  The
   allowed values of b1 are 0 to 6, i.e., the minimum block size is
   2**(0+4) = 16 and the maximum is 2**(6+4) = 1024.  The block-size
   numbers MUST appear in numerical order, starting with the lowest
   number (see [I-D.ietf-core-block]).

                           "b1s":[b1s1,b1s2,...]
                           "b2s":[b2s1,b2s2,...]

                     Figure 3: "b1s" and "b2s" syntax

   When including the "b1s" or the "b2s" profile fields in the profile
   description of a resource, all respective Block1 and Block2 sizes
   that are supported in block-wise transfer by that resource MUST be
   included.  Block sizes that are not supported by the resource MUST
   NOT be included in the "b1s" or the "b2s" profile fields.

   If the "b1s" or the "b2s" profile fields are available, the receiving
   party SHALL assume a non-listed block size is not supported by the
   associated resource.  If only one of the "b1s" and the "b2s" profile
   fields is available, the receiving party SHALL assume that the other
   block transfer is not supported by the associated resource.

Internet-Draft       CoAP Profile Description Format        October 2012


5.  Usage of URI Queries

   To specify which information is needed, the client MAY include an
   "Uri-Query" option in its request for the profile description.  The
   server SHOULD understand and process this information, although
   constraint servers MAY omit the functionality.  In the latter case,
   they SHOULD return the same results as if the "Uri-Query" option was
   not included.

   The URI Queries are of the form "N=V", where N is the name of the
   field to filter on, and V is the desired value.

   For example, if the client wants to know all resources on the server
   that support content format "application/json", which has the number
   50 (see [I-D.ietf-core-coap]), then it will include a "Uri-Query"
   option with the value "cf=50".

   When the request contains multiple "Uri-Query" options, "AND"
   semantics hold.

6.  Forward compatibility

   To allow addition of new profile fields in the future, unknown
   profile fields SHOULD be ignored by the client.

7.  Examples

   The following is an example of a camera sensor at
   "coap://www.example.org/cam", that supports the "Uri-Host" (3),
   "ETag" (4), "Uri-Port" (7), "Uri-Path" (11), "Content-Format" (12),
   "Token" (19), "Block2" (23) and "Proxy-Uri" (35) options.

   The supported content formats are "text/plain" (0), "application/
   link-format" (40) and "application/json" (50).

   The camera can support Block2 with Block sizes of 256 or 512 bytes.

            Req: GET coap://www.example.org/.well-known/profile

            Res: 2.05 Content (application/json)
            {
              "profile":
              {
                "path":"cam",
                "op":[3,4,7,11,12,19,23,35],
                "cf":[0,40,50]
                "b2s":[4,5]
              }
            }

   If the server also supports three other resources, such as a
   temperature sensor (which can do observe), a humidity and a fire
   detector, the request/response pair would look as follows:

Internet-Draft       CoAP Profile Description Format        October 2012


            Req: GET coap://www.example.org/.well-known/profile

            Res: 2.05 Content (application/json)
            {
              "profile":[
                {
                  "path":".",
                  "op":[3,4,7,11,12,19,35],
                  "cf":[0]
               },
               {
                  "path":"cam",
                  "op":[3,4,7,11,12,19,23,35],
                  "cf":[0,40,50]
                  "b2s":[4,5]
                },
                {
                  "path":"temperature",
                  "op":[3,4,6,7,11,12,19,35],
                  "cf":[0]
                },
              ]
            }

   Please note that the response did not include profiles for the "fire"
   and "humidity" resources.  Instead it included a default profile that
   applies for these two not explicitly mentioned resources.

   If the client now wants to get the resources that support content-
   format "application/json" (50) it looks as follows:

         Req: GET coap://www.example.org/.well-known/profile?cf=50

         Res: 2.05 Content (application/json)
         {
           "profile":
           {
             "path":"cam",
             "op":[3,4,7,11,12,19,23,35],
             "cf":[0,40,50]
             "b2s":[4,5]
           }
         }

8.  Open topics

8.1.  Open since v00

   o  How to signal the client profile?

   o  Which other profile data needs signalling?

   o  A natural content format for a camera would be JPEG.  Therefore
      the "image/jpeg" content format may need CoAP registration.

   o  Currently, support of observe can be signalled in the link format
      as well as through the mechanism described here.

   o  Is it needed to signal the profile description on a resource
      basis, or would it be enough to have only one, associated with the
      server?

   o  Fix the order in which the profile fields must appear?

   o  Make a distinction between "critical" and "elective" profile
      fields?

8.2.  Open since v01

   o  Addition of the "path" option seems to create overlap with the
      link format.

   o  For the time being, text about the hierarchy of profiles in
      servers, batches and resources has been removed.  This leads to a
      requirement to provide the profile description for each separate
      resource.  A mechanism to re-introduce hierarchy may make
      significantly reduce the profile description verboseness.

10.  Security Considerations

   For general CoAP security considerations see [I-D.ietf-core-coap].

   In an unprotected environment, an attacker can change the profile
   description.  For example, the list of supported options may be
   changed.  This could cause the client to make a wrong decision on
   which mechanisms to use.  However, such a threat is normal in
   environments that lack secure authentication.

11.  IANA Considerations

   o  A registry for profile fields as well as possible values needs to
      be set up.

   o  The ".well-known/profile" path component must be registered.
