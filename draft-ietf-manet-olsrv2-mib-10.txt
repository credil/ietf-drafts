Abstract

   This document defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module
   for configuring and managing the Optimized Link State Routing
   protocol version 2 (OLSRv2).  The OLSRv2-MIB module is structured
   into configuration information, state information, performance
   information, and notifications.  This additional state and
   performance information is useful to troubleshoot problems and
   performance issues of the routing protocol.  Two levels of compliance
   allow this MIB module to be deployed on constrained routers.

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                    June 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module
   for configuring and managing the Optimized Link State Routing
   protocol version 2 (OLSRv2).  The OLSRv2-MIB module is structured
   into configuration information, state information, performance
   information, and notifications.  In addition to configuration, this
   additional state and performance information is useful to
   troubleshoot problems and performance issues of the routing protocol.
   Different levels of compliance allow implementers to use smaller
   subsets of all defined objects, allowing for this MIB module to be
   deployed on more constrained routers.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to Section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB module are defined using the mechanisms defined in
   the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This document
   specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is
   described in [RFC2578], [RFC2579], and [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2) [OLSRv2]
   is a table driven, proactive routing protocol, i.e., it exchanges
   topology information with other routers in the network periodically.
   OLSRv2 is an optimization of the classical link state routing
   protocol.  Its key concept is that of MultiPoint Relays (MPRs).  Each
   router selects a set of its neighbor routers (which "cover" all of
   its symmetrically connected 2-hop neighbor routers) as MPRs.  MPRs
   are then used to achieve both flooding reduction and topology
   reduction.

   This document provides management and control capabilities of an
   OLSRv2 instance, allowing to monitor the state and performance of an

   OLSRV2 router, as well as to change settings of the OLSRv2 instance
   (e.g., router or interface parameters such as message intervals
   etc.).

   As OLSRv2 relies on the neighborhood information discovered by the
   "Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Neighborhood Discovery Protocol
   (NHDP)" [RFC6130], the OLSRv2-MIB module is aligned with the NHDP-MIB
   [RFC6779] module and augments several of the tables and objects in
   the NHDP-MIB.  In particular, common indexes for router interfaces
   and discovered neighbors are used, as described in Section 5.2.

4.1.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Configuration Objects - switches, tables, objects which are
      initialized to default settings or set through the management
      interface defined by this MIB module.

   o  State Objects - automatically generated values which define the
      current operating state of the OLSRv2 protocol process in the
      router.

   o  Performance Objects - automatically generated values which help an
      administrator or automated tool to assess the performance of the
      OLSRv2 routing process on the router.

   o  Notification Objects - define triggers and associated notification
      messages allowing for asynchronous tracking of pre-defined events
      on the managed router.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the OLSRv2-MIB module.  The
   objects are arranged into the following structure:

   o  olsrv2MIBObjects - defines objects forming the basis for the
      OLSRv2-MIB module.  These objects are divided up by function into
      the following groups:

      *  Configuration Group - defining objects related to the
         configuration of the OLSRv2 instance on the router.

      *  State Group - defining objects which reflect the current state
         of the OLSRv2 instance running on the router.

      *  Performance Group -defining objects which are useful to a
         management station when characterizing the performance of

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                    June 2013


         OLSRv2 on the router and in the MANET.

   o  olsrv2MIBNotifications - objects defining OLSRv2-MIB module
      notifications.

   o  olsrv2MIBConformance - defining the minimal and maximal
      conformance requirements for implementations of this MIB module.

5.1.  The Configuration Group

   The OLSRv2 router is configured with a set of controls.  The
   authoritative list of configuration controls within the OLSRv2-MIB
   module are found within the MIB module itself.  Generally, an attempt
   was made in developing the OLSRv2-MIB module to support all
   configuration objects defined in [OLSRv2].  For all of the
   configuration parameters, the same constraints and default values of
   these parameters as defined in [OLSRv2] are followed.

5.2.  The State Group

   The State Group reports current state information of a router running
   [OLSRv2].  The OLSRv2-MIB module State Group tables were designed to
   contain the complete set of state information defined within the
   information bases in [OLSRv2].

   The OLSRv2-MIB module State Group tables are constructed as
   extensions to the corresponding tables within the State Group of the
   NHDP-MIB [RFC6779] module.  Use of the AUGMENTS clause is made, when
   possible, to accomplish these table extensions.  Further, the State
   Group tables defined in this MIB module are aligned with the
   according tables in the NHDP-MIB [RFC6779] module, as described in
   Section 6.2.

5.3.  The Performance Group

   The Performance Group reports values relevant to system performance.
   Frequent changes of sets or frequent recalculation of the routing set
   or the MPRs can have a negative influence on the performance of
   OLSRv2.  This MIB module defines several objects that can be polled
   in order to, e.g., calculate histories or monitor frequencies of
   changes.  This may help the network administrator to determine
   unusual topology changes or other changes that affect stability and
   reliability of the MANET.  One such framework is specified in REPORT-
   MIB [REPORT-MIB].

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                    June 2013


5.4.  The Notifications Group

   The Notifications Group contains Control
   (olsrv2NotificationsControl), Objects (olsrv2NotificationsObjects)
   and States (olsrv2NotificationsStates), where the Control contains
   definitions of objects to control the frequency of notifications
   being generated.  The Objects define the supported notifications and
   the State is used to define additional information to be carried
   within the notifications.

   The olsrv2NotificationsObjects sub-tree contains the list of
   notifications supported within the OLSRv2-MIB module and their
   intended purpose or utility.

   The same mechanisms for improving the network performance by reducing
   the number of notifications apply as defined in Section 5.1 of
   [RFC6779].  The following objects are used to define the thresholds
   and time windows for specific notifications defined in the NHDP-MIB
   module: olsrv2RoutingSetRecalculationCountThreshold,
   olsrv2RoutingSetRecalculationCountWindow,
   olsrv2MPRSetRecalculationCountThreshold, and
   olsrv2MPRSetRecalculationCountWindow.

5.5.  Tables and Indexing

   The OLSRv2-MIB module's tables are indexed by the following
   constructs:

   o  nhdpIfIndex - the ifIndex of the local router on which NHDP is
      configured.  This is defined in the NHDP-MIB.

   o  nhdpDiscIfIndex - a locally managed index representing a known
      interface on a neighboring router.  This is defined in the NHDP-
      MIB.

   o  nhdpDiscRouterIndex - a locally managed index representing an ID
      of a known neighboring router.  This is defined in the NHDP-MIB.

   o  {olsrv2LibOrigSetIpAddrType, olsrv2LibOrigSetIpAddr} - this index
      (pair) uniquely identifies recently used originator addresses
      found within the olsrv2LibOrigSetTable.

   o  {olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetIpAddrType, olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetIpAddr,
      olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetIpAddrPerfixLen} - this index (triplet)
      uniquely identifies local attached networks reachable through
      local (non-OLSRv2) interfaces on this router.  These are recorded
      in the olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetTable.

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                    June 2013


   o  {olsrv2TibAdRemoteRouterSetIpAddrType,
      olsrv2TibAdRemoteRouterSetIpAddr} - this index (pair) uniquely
      identifies each router in the network that transmits TC messages
      received by this router.  These records are recorded in the
      olsrv2TibAdRemoteRouterSetIpAddr.

   o  {olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetFromOrigIpAddrType,
      olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetFromOrigIpAddr,
      olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetToOrigIpAddrType,
      olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetToOrigIpAddr} - this index (quadruplet)
      uniquely identifies discovered links within the network recorded
      by this router.  Information associated with each link is stored
      in the olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetTable.

   o  {olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetFromOrigIpAddrType,
      olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetFromOrigIpAddr,
      olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetFromDestIpAddrType,
      olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetFromDestIpAddr} - this index
      (quadruplet) uniquely identifies reachable addresses within the
      network and the router's advertising these addresses.  This
      information is stored in the
      olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetTable.

   o  {olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetOrigIpAddrType,
      olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetOrigIpAddr,
      olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetNetIpAddrType,
      olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetNetIpAddr,
      olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetNetIpAddrPrefixLen} - this index
      (quintuplet) uniquely identifies the networks (which may be
      outside the MANET) and the routers through which these networks
      can be reached.  This information is stored in the
      olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetTable.

   o  {olsrv2TibRoutingSetDestIpAddrType, olsrv2TibRoutingSetDestIpAddr,
      olsrv2TibRoutingSetDestIpAddrPrefixLen} - this index (triplet)
      uniquely identifies the address of a reachable destination in the
      network.  This indexes the olsrv2TibRoutingSetTable which contains
      the next hop information to reach the indexed addresses.

   These tables and their indexing are:

   o  olsrv2InterfaceTable - describes the OLSRv2 status on the NHDP
      interfaces of this router.  This table augments nhdpInterfaceEntry
      and as such it is indexed by the {nhdpIfIndex} from the NHDP-MIB.

   o  olsrv2IibLinkSetTable - records all links from other routers which
      are, or recently were, 1-hop neighbors.  This table augments
      nhdpIibLinkSetEntry and as such it is indexed by nhdpIfIndex and

      nhdpDiscIfIndex.

   o  olsrv2Iib2HopSetTable - records network addresses of symmetric
      2-hop neighbors and the links to the associated 1-hop neighbors.
      This table augments nhdpIib2HopSetEntry and as such it is indexed
      by {nhdpIfIndex, nhdpDiscIfIndex, nhdpIib2HopSetIpAddressType,
      nhdpIib2HopSetIpAddress}.

   o  olsrv2LibOrigSetTable - records addresses that were recently used
      as originator addresses by this router.  This table is indexed by
      {olsrv2LibOrigSetIpAddrType, olsrv2LibOrigSetIpAddr}.

   o  olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetTable - records its local non-OLSRv2
      interfaces via which it can act as gateways to other networks.
      This table is indexed by {olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetIpAddrType,
      olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetIpAddr,
      olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetIpAddrPerfixLen}.

   o  olsrv2NibNeighborSetTable - records all network addresses of each
      1-hop neighbor.  This table augments nhdpNibNeighborSetEntry and
      as such it is indexed by the {nhdpDiscRouterIndex}.

   o  olsrv2TibAdRemoteRouterSetTable - records information describing
      each remote router in the network that transmits TC messages.
      This table is indexed by {olsrv2TibAdRemoteRouterSetIpAddrType,
      olsrv2TibAdRemoteRouterSetIpAddr}.

   o  olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetTable - records topology information
      about the network.  This table is indexed by
      {olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetFromOrigIpAddrType,

      from the NHDP-MIB.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   This section specifies the relationship of the MIB modules contained
   in this document to other standards, particularly to standards
   containing other MIB modules.  MIB modules and specific definitions
   imported from MIB modules that SHOULD be implemented in conjunction
   with the MIB module contained within this document are identified in
   this section.

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The System group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] module is defined as
   being mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity
   as a whole.  The System group provides identification of the
   management entity and certain other system-wide data.  The OLSRv2-MIB
   module does not duplicate those objects.

6.2.  Relationship to the NHDP-MIB

   OLSRv2 depends on the neighborhood information that is discovered by
   [RFC6130].  An instance of OLSRv2 MUST have an associated instance of
   NHDP running on the same device for proper operations of the
   discovery and routing system.  In order for the OLSRv2-MIB module to
   correctly populate the objects relating to discovered neighbors, the
   State Group tables of the NHDP-MIB [RFC6779] module are aligned with
   the State Group tables of this MIB module.  This is accomplished
   through the use of the AUGMENTS capability of SMIv2 (where
   appropriate).  This will allow for cross referencing of information
   between the two MIB modules within a given SNMP context.

6.3.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The following OLSRv2-MIB module IMPORTS objects from NHDP-MIB
   [RFC6779], SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF

     DESCRIPTION
        "This data type is used as the syntax of the
         olsrv2LinkMetricType object in the definition
         of the OLSRv2-MIB module.

         The olsrv2LinkMetricType corresponds to
         LINK_METRIC_TYPE of OLSRv2 (RFC XXXX).
         OLSRv2 uses bidirectional additive link metrics
         to determine shortest distance routes (i.e.,
         routes with smallest total of link metric values).

         OLSRv2 has established a registry for the LINK_METRIC_TYPEs
         (denoted 'LINK_METRIC Address Block TLV Type Extensions'):
                http://www.iana.org/assignments/manet-parameters/
                     manet-parameters.xml#
                     link-metric-address-block-tlv-type-extension

         This is done in Section 24.5 in OLSRv2. The LINK_METRIC_TYPE
         (which has as corresponding object in the MIB module
         olsrv2LinkMetricType) corresponds to the type extension of
         the LINK_METRIC TLV that is set up in the
         'LINK_METRIC Address Block TLV Type Extensions' registry.
         Whenever new link metric types are added to that registry,
         IANA MUST update this textual convention accordingly.

         The definition of this textual convention with the
         addition of newly assigned values is published
         periodically by the IANA, in either the Assigned
         Numbers RFC, or some derivative of it specific to
         Internet Network Management number assignments.  (The
         latest arrangements can be obtained by contacting the
         IANA.)

         Requests for new values should be made to IANA via

     STATUS      current
     DESCRIPTION
        "OLSRv2 Metrics are expressed in terms of a Link Metric
         Compressed Form within the OLSRv2 protocol.  This textual
         convention defines the syntax of the metric objects
         consistent with the definitions of the OLSRv2 Link
         Metric Compressed Form.

         The 12-bit compressed form of a link metric uses a modified
         form of a representation with an 8-bit mantissa (denoted a)
         and a 4-bit exponent (denoted b).  Note that if represented
         as the 12 bit value 256b+a then the ordering of those 12 bit
         values is identical to the ordering of the represented values.

         The value so represented is (257+a)2^b - 256, where ^ denotes
         exponentiation.  This has a minimum value
         (when a = 0 and b = 0) of MINIMUM_METRIC = 1 and a maximum
         value (when a = 255 and b = 15) of MAXIMUM_METRIC = 2^24 - 256.

         Hence the compressed form metric values range from 1 to
         16776960.  The special value of 0 is reserved for the
         UNKNOWN_METRIC value."

            Sequence numbers are used in the OLSRv2 protocol
            for the purpose of discarding 'old' information,
            i.e., messages received out of order.  However
            with a limited number of bits for representing
            sequence numbers, wrap-around (that the sequence
            number is incremented from the maximum possible
            value to zero) will occur.  To prevent this from
            interfering with the operation of this protocol,
            the following MUST be observed when determining
            the ordering of sequence numbers.

            The term MAXVALUE designates in the following one
            more than the largest possible value for a sequence
            number.  For a 16 bit sequence number (as are those
            defined in this specification) MAXVALUE is 65536.

            The sequence number S1 is said to be 'greater than'
            the sequence number S2 if:

               o  S1 > S2 AND S1 - S2 < MAXVALUE/2 OR

               o  S2 > S1 AND S2 - S1 > MAXVALUE/2

            When sequence numbers S1 and S2 differ by MAXVALUE/2
            their ordering cannot be determined.  In this case,
            which should not occur, either ordering may be

8.  Security Considerations

   This MIB module defines objects for the configuration, monitoring and
   notification of the Optimized Link State Routing protocol version 2
   [OLSRv2].  OLSRv2 allows routers to acquire topological information
   of the routing domain by virtue of exchanging TC message, to
   calculate shortest paths to each destination router in the routing

   domain, to select relays for network-wide transmissions etc.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      control the rate at which TC messages are sent.  If set at too
      high a rate, this could represent a form of DOS attack by
      overloading interface resources.  If set low, OLSRv2 may not
      converge fast enough to provide accurate routes to all
      destinations in the routing domain.

   o  olsrv2TcHopLimit - defines the hop limit for TC messages.  If set
      too low, messages will not be forwarded beyond the defined scope,
      and thus routers further away from the message originator will not
      be able to construct appropriate topology graphs.

   o  olsrv2OHoldTime, olsrv2THoldTime, olsrv2AHoldTime,
      olsrv2RxHoldTime, olsrv2PHoldTime, olsrv2FHoldTime - define hold
      times for tuples of different Information Bases of OLSRv2.  If set
      too low, information will expire quickly, and may this harm a
      correct operation of the routing protocol.

   o  olsrv2WillFlooding and olsrv2WillRouting - define the willingness
      of this router to become MPR.  If this is set to WILL_NEVER (0),
      the managed router will not forward any TC messages, nor accept a
      selection to become MPR by neighboring routers.  If set to
      WILL_ALWAYS (15), the router will be preferred by neighbors during
      MPR selection, and may thus attract more traffic.

   o  olsrv2TpMaxJitter, olsrv2TtMaxJitter, olsrv2FMaxJitter - define
      jitter values for TC message transmission and forwarding.  If set
      too low, control traffic may get lost if the channel is lossy.

   o  olsrv2LinkMetricType - defines the type of the link metric that a
      router uses (e.g., ETX or hop-count).  Whenever this value
      changes, all link metric information recorded by the router is
      invalid, causing a reset of information acquired from other
      routers in the MANET.  Moreover, if olsrv2LinkMetricType on a
      router is set to a value that is not known to other routers in the
      MANET, these routers will not be able to establish routes to that
      router or transiting that router.  Existing routes to the router
      with a olsrv2LinkMetricType unknown to other routers in the MANET

      will be removed.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetTable - The contains information on the
      topology of the MANET, specifically the IP address of the routers
      in the MANET (as identified by
      olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetFromOrigIpAddr and
      olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetToOrigIpAddr objects).  This information
      provides an adversary broad information on the members of the
      MANET, located within this single table.  This information can be
      used to expedite attacks on the other members of the MANET without
      having to go through a laborious discovery process on their own.

   Some of the Tables in this MIB AUGMENT Tables defined in NHDP-MIB
   [RFC6779].  Hence, care must be taken in configuring access control
   here in order make sure that the permitted permissions granted for
   the AUGMENT-ing Tables here are consistent with the access controls
   permitted within the NHDP-MIB.  The below list identifies the
   AUGMENT-ing Tables and their NHDP-MIB counterparts.  It is recommend
   that access control policies for these Table pairs are consistently
   set.

   o  The olsrv2InterfaceTable AUGMENTs the nhdpInterfaceTable.

   o  The olsrv2IibLinkSetTable AUGMENTs the nhdpIibLinkSetTable.

   o  The olsrv2Iib2HopSetTable AUGMENTs the nhdpIib2HopSetTable.

   o  The olsrv2NibNeighborSetTable AUGMENTs the
      nhdpNibNeighborSetTable.

   o  The olsrv2InterfacePerfTable AUGMENTs the nhdpInterfacePerfTable.

   MANET technology is often deployed to support communications of
   emergency services or military tactical applications.  In these
   applications, it is imperative to maintain the proper operation of
   the communications network and to protect sensitive information
   related to its operation.  Therefore, when implementing these
   capabilities, the full use of SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms for
   authentication and privacy is RECOMMENDED.

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                    June 2013


   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  Applicability Statement

   This document describes objects for configuring parameters of the
   Optimized Link State Routing version 2 (OLSRv2) Protocol [OLSRv2]
   process on a router.  This MIB module, denoted OLSRv2-MIB, also
   reports state, performance information and notifications.  The OLSRv2
   protocol relies upon information gathered via the Neighborhood
   Discovery Protocol [RFC6130] in order to perform its operations.  The
   NHDP protocol is managed via the NHDP-MIB [RFC6779].

   MANET deployments can greatly differ in aspects of dynamics of the
   topology, capacity and loss rates of underlying channels, traffic
   flow directions, memory and CPU capacity of routers etc.  SNMP and
   therefore this MIB module are only applicable for a subset of MANET
   deployments, in particular deployments:

   o  In which routers have enough memory and CPU resources to run SNMP
      and expose the MIB module.

   o  Where a network management station (NMS) is defined to which
      notifications are generated, and from which routers can be
      managed.

   o  Where this NMS is reachable from routers in the MANET most of the
      time (as notifications to the NMS and management information from

Internet-Draft               The OLSRv2-MIB                    June 2013


      the NMS to the router will be lost when connectivity is
      temporarily lost).  This requires that the topology of the MANET
      is only moderately dynamic.

   o  Where the underlying wireless channel supports enough bandwidth to
      run SNMP, and where loss rates of the channel are not exhaustive.

   Certain MANET deployments, such as community networks with non-mobile
   routers, dynamic topology because of changing link quality, and a
   pre-defined gateway (that could also serve as NMS), are examples of
   networks applicable for this MIB module.  Other, more constrained
   deployments of MANETs may not be able to run SNMP and require
   different management protocols.

   Some level of configuration, i.e., read-write objects, is desirable
   for OLSRv2 deployments.  Topology related configuration such as the
   ability to enable OLSRv2 on new interfaces or initially configure
   OLSRv2 on a router's interfaces through the
   olsrv2InterfaceAdminStatus object is critical to initial system
   startup.  The OLSRv2 protocol allows for some level of performance
   tuning through various protocol parameters and this MIB module allows
   for configuration of those protocol parameters through read-write
   objects such as the olsrv2TcHopLimit or the olsrv2FMaxJitter.  Other
   read-write objects allow for the control of Notification behavior
   through this MIB module, e.g., the
   olsrv2RoutingSetRecalculationCountThreshold object.  A fuller
   discussion of MANET network management applicability is to be
   provided elsewhere [USE-CASES].

10.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER value recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

         Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
