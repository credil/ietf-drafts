1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) protocol ([RFC1034], [RFC1035]) as
   implemented and deployed on the Internet includes thirteen so-called
   "Root Servers".  These servers are authoritative-only DNS servers
   which answer authoritatively for the root zone of the DNS, often
   denoted by a single period (".").  The operators of such servers are
   known as Root Server Operators.

   [RFC2870] was originally published to document operational
   requirements for Root Server Operators.

   This document reclassifies [RFC2870] to Historic.  This memo also
   obsoletes [RFC2870].

2.  Guidance for Root Server Operation

   Guidance to Root Server Operators, and information which might help
   set expectations of Root Server Operators by the rest of the
   technical community, can be found in [RSSAC001].  This document is a
   product of the ICANN Root Server System Advisory Committee (RSSAC).

3.  Reclassification of RFC 2870 to Historic

   [RFC2870] presented a set of technical implementation and operational
   requirements for Root Servers.  It included detailed requirements for
   service implementation that were useful for the time in which the
   document was published; however, that guidance has decreased in
   relevance as experience with large-scale authoritative DNS server
   deployment has increased.  Modern DNS infrastructure typically
   incorporates a variety of deployment techniques intended to
   facilitate very high query rates, and in the modern environment any
   Root Server built precisely to the specification presented in
   [RFC2870] would be grossly inadequate.  Today, [RFC2870] provides
   value only as a part of the historical record of the ongoing
   development of the DNS.

   This document directs the RFC Editor to mark the document [RFC2870]
   as historic.
