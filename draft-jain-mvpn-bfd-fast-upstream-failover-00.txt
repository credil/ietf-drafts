1.  Introduction

   In case of multicast in BGP/MPLS VPNs deployment, for purpose of
   redundancy the multicast source could be dual-homed to the Root
   PE(s).  The dual-homed Root PE(s) could individually originate
   P-Tunnel towards the Leaf PE.  This mechanism is described in
   [I-D.draft-morin-l3vpn-mvpn-fast-failover].  The Leaf PE can source
   the traffic from either of the upstream dual-homed Root PE node.  In
   such a deployment, there could be two types of failure scenarios:-

   1.  Failure of any network element in the provider network between
       Root PE and Leaf PE.

   2.  Failure of any network element between the Multicast Source and
       the Root PEs.

   It is desirable to achieve fast failure detection and switchover for
   any failure from above scenarios.

   This document addresses both the above failure scenarios by using BFD
   for Multipoint Networks [I-D.katz-ward-bfd-multipoint] and defining
   new BGP extensions for advertising the BFD parameters which will be
   used for fast failure detection of scenarios mentioned above.

2.  Terminology

   Terminology used in this document:

   Root PE: PE closest to the Multicast Source (This could be either
   directly connected to Multicast Source or via some network).
   P-Tunnel would be originating at this node.  This P-Tunnel could be
   Inclusive or Selective.

   Leaf PE: PE Node closest to the Multicast Receiver (This could be
   either directly connected to Multicast Source or via some network).
   P-Tunnel would be terminating at this node.

   BFD : Bidirectional Forwarding Detection.

   Other terminologies are as defined in [RFC6513] and [RFC6514].

      <--Source to Root Network--><---------MVPN Context------------>




   As seen in the above diagram, all the PEs would be part of same
   multicast VPN.  Multiple multicast sources (S1..Sn) could be dual-
   homed to two PEs (PE1 and PE2), referenced as Root PEs.  Both the
   Root PEs would originate P-tunnel, which would terminate at Leaf PE
   (PE3).

   As long as C-S is reachable via both Root PEs, the Leaf PE will
   select one of the PEs connected to C-S as its Upstream PE with
   respect to C-S, this PE would be referred as "Primary Upstream PE".
   We will refer to the other PE connected to C-S as the "Standby
   Upstream PE".  Note that if the connectivity to C-S through the
   Primary Upstream PE becomes unavailable, then the PE will select the
   Standby Upstream PE as its Upstream PE with respect to C-S.  This
   procedure is described in [I-D.draft-morin-l3vpn-mvpn-fast-failover].

   If it is desired to use BFD to monitor the status of the P-Tunnel,
   then there is a need to exchange the BFD discriminator between the
   Root PE node and Leaf PE.

   If it is desired to use BFD to monitor the status of individual
   Multicast Source and P-Tunnel pair, then there is also a need to
   exchange the BFD discriminator between the Root PE node and Leaf PE
   to track the Multicast-Source and P-Tunnel pair status.

   This document defines new BGP extensions for advertising the BFD
   parameters to bring up BFD for Multipoint Networks session
   [I-D.katz-ward-bfd-multipoint] which would be used to track and
   addresses both the above failure scenarios.

4.  BGP-BFD Attribute

   This document defines and uses a new BGP attribute called the "BGP-
   BFD attribute".  This is an optional transitive BGP attribute.  The
   format of this attribute is defined as follows:

           +-------------------------------+
           |       Flags (1 octet)         |
           +-------------------------------+
           |  BFD Discriminator (2 octets) |
           +-------------------------------+

   The Flags field has the following format:

                 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
                 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                 |   reserved    |
                 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   BFD Discriminator: This is the local discriminator for this BFD
   session, and is used to uniquely identify it.  It MUST be unique
   across all BFD sessions on this system, and nonzero.  It SHOULD be
   set to a random (but still unique) value to improve security.  The
   value is otherwise outside the scope of this specification.

5.  Signaling procedures and usage considerations

   If it is desired to track the P-tunnel status or status of the
   Multicast Source connected to Root PE using BFD.  It could be
   explicitly configured under the MVPN Service.

5.1.  Tunnel Status Tracking for I-PMSI P-tunnel

5.1.1.  Root PE Procedures

   When it is desired to track the P-Tunnel status using BFD, the Root
   PE MUST include the BGP-BFD Attribute in the I-PMSI A-D Route
   specified in [RFC6514] Section 4.1.

   If a P-Tunnel is already signaled, and then it is desired to track
   the P-Tunnel status using BFD, I-PMSI A-D Route must be re-sent with
   the same attributes as before, but the BGP-BFD Attribute MUST be
   included.

   If P-Tunnel is already signaled, and P-Tunnel status tracked using
   BFD and it is desired to stop tracking P-Tunnel status using BFD,
   then I-PMSI A-D Route MUST be re-sent with the same attributes as
   before, but the BGP-BFD Attribute MUST be excluded.

5.1.2.  Leaf PE Procedures

   On receiving the BFD attribute in the I-PMSI A-D Route, the Leaf PE
   MUST associate the received discriminator with the P-Tunnel
   originating from the Root PE.  Once the Leaf PE start getting the BFD
   probes from the Root PE with the said discriminator, the BFD session
   will be declared up and will then be used to track the health of the
   P-Tunnel.

   If the Leaf PE does not receive BFD probes for a P-Tunnel from give
   Root PE for Detection Time, the BFD session would be brought down.
   And, it would declare the P-tunnel associated with the discriminator
   as down.

   Leaf PE then can then initiate a switchover of the traffic from the
   Primary Tunnel, to the Standby Tunnel.

   When Leaf PE's P-Tunnel is already up, it receives new I-PMSI A-D
   Route with BGP-BFD attribute, it must accept the I-PMSI A-D Route and
   associate the discriminator with the P-tunnel.  When the BFD probes
   are received with the said discriminator, the BFD session is declared
   up.

   When Leaf PE's P-Tunnel is already up, and is tracked with BFD, and



Jain, et al.            Expires October 23, 2012                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft    BGP Extensions for MVPN Fast Failover       April 2012


   it receives new I-PMSI A-D Route without BGP-BFD attribute, it must
   accept the I-PMSI A-D Route the BFD session should be declared admin
   down.  Receiver node SHOULD not switch the traffic to the Standby
   P-tunnel.

5.2.  Tunnel Status Tracking for S-PMSI P-tunnel

   All procedures mentioned in this section are same as of tracking of
   I-PMSI P-Tunnel, except that the BGP-BFD Attribute would be sent in
   S-PMSI A-D Route.

5.2.1.  Root PE Procedures

   When is desired to track the P-Tunnel status using BFD, the Root PE
   MUST include the BGP-BFD Attribute in the S-PMSI A-D Route specified
   in [RFC6514] Section 4.4.

   If a P-Tunnel is already signaled, and then it is desired to track
   the P-Tunnel status using BFD, S-PMSI A-D Route must be re-sent with
   the same attributes as before, but the BGP-BFD Attribute MUST be
   included.

   If P-Tunnel is already signaled, and P-Tunnel status tracked using
   BFD and it is desired to stop tracking P-Tunnel status using BFD,
   then S-PMSI A-D Route MUST be re-sent with the same attributes as
   before, but the BGP-BFD Attribute MUST be excluded.

5.2.2.  Leaf PE Procedures

   On receiving the BFD attribute in the S-PMSI A-D Route, the Leaf PE
   MUST associate the received discriminator with the P-Tunnel
   originating from the Root PE.  Once the Leaf PE start getting the BFD
   probes from the Root PE with the said discriminator, the BFD session
   will be declared up and will then be used to track the health of the
   P-Tunnel.

   If the Leaf PE does not receive BFD probes from give Detection Time
   for a give P-Tunnel, it would declare the P-tunnel associated with
   the discriminator as down.

   Leaf PE then can then initiate a switchover of the traffic from the
   Primary Tunnel, to the Standby Tunnel.

   When Leaf PE's P-Tunnel is already up, it receives new S-PMSI A-D
   Route with BGP-BFD attribute, it must accept the S-PMSI A-D Route and
   associate the discriminator with the P-tunnel.  When the BFD probes
   are received with the said discriminator, the BFD session is declared
   up.

   When Leaf PE's P-Tunnel is already up, and is tracked with BFD, and
   it receives new S-PMSI A-D Route without BGP-BFD attribute, it must
   accept the S-PMSI A-D Route the BFD session should be declared admin
   down.  Receiver node SHOULD not switch the traffic to the Standby
   P-tunnel.

5.3.  Multicast Source Status Tracking

5.3.1.  Root PE Procedures

   When is desired to track the connectivity status of Multicast-Source
   at the Root PE(s), the Root PE MUST include the BGP-BFD Attribute in
   the Source Active A-D Route specified in [RFC6514] Section 4.5.

   The discriminator advertised in BGP-BFD Attribute in the Source
   Active A-D Route, would be used track the Multicast Source and the
   P-Tunnel from the Root PE that originated the Source Active A-D
   Route.

   When the Root PE detects that Multicast Source is reachable, it will
   start BFD probes over the P-Tunnel, for P-Tunnel and Multicast Source
   combination.

   The procedure or techniques used for tracking the Multicast-Source
   reachibility at the Root PE(s) could be router reachibility,
   interface tracking for directly connected Multicast Source, BFD,
   traffic monitoring from a given Multicast Source etc.  The details of
   the above techniques is outside the scope of this document.

5.3.2.  Leaf PE Procedures

   On receiving the BFD attribute in the Source Active A-D Route, the
   Leaf PE MUST associate the received discriminator with the P-Tunnel
   and Multicast Source combination.  Once the Leaf PE start getting the
   BFD probes from the Root PE with the said discriminator, the BFD
   session will be declared up and will then be used to track the health
   of the P-Tunnel and Multicast Source combination.

   When the Root PE detects that Multicast Source is no longer
   reachable, it will advertise the BFD Status for P-Tunnel and
   Multicast Source combination to be down by signaling it in DIAG field
   of BFD.  Leaf PE on receipt of BFD status down for P-Tunnel and
   Multicast Source combination, SHOULD declare the source un-reachable
   through the given PMSI and can then initiate a switchover of the
   traffic from the Primary Tunnel, to the Standby Tunnel.
