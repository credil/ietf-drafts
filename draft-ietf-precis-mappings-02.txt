                 Mapping characters for PRECIS classes
                     draft-ietf-precis-mappings-02

Abstract

   The framework for preparation and comparison of internationalized
   strings ("PRECIS") defines several classes of strings for preparation
   and comparison.  In the framework, case mapping is defined because
   many protocols handle case-sensitive or case-insensitive string
   comparison and therefore preparation of the string is mandatory.  As
   described in the mapping for Internationalized Domain Names in
   Applications (IDNA) and the PRECIS problem statement, mappings for
   internationalized strings are not limited to case, but also width
   mapping and mapping of delimiters and other specials can be taken
   into consideration.  This document provides guidelines for authors of
   protocol profiles of the PRECIS framework and describes several
   mappings that can be applied between receiving user input and passing
   permitted code points to internationalized protocols.  The mappings
   described here are expected to be applied as Addtional mapping in the
   PRECIS framework.

1.  Introduction

   In many cases, user input of internationalized strings is generated
   through the use of an input method editor ("IME") or through copy-
   and-paste from free text.  Usually users do not care about the case
   and/or width of input characters because they appear to be visually
   identical.  Further, users rarely switch IME state to input special
   characters such as protocol elements.  For Internationalized Domain
   Names ("IDNs"), the IDNA Mapping specification [RFC5895] describes
   methods for handling these issues.  For PRECIS strings, case mapping
   and width mapping are defined in the PRECIS framework specification
   [I-D.ietf-precis-framework], but delimiter mapping, special mapping,
   and language dependent mapping are not defined.  Handling of mappings

   other than case and width is also important to increase chance of
   strings match as users expect.  This document provides guidelines for
   authors of protocol profiles of the PRECIS framework and describes
   mappings that can be applied between receiving user input and passing
   permitted code points to internationalized protocols.  The mappings
   described in this document are expected to be applied as Addtional
   mapping in the PRECIS framework.

2.  Protocol dependent mappings

   The PRECIS framework defines several protocol-independent mappings.
   The additional mappings defined in this document are protocol-
   dependent, i.e., they depend on the rules for a particular
   application protocol.

2.1.  Delimiter mapping

   Some application protocols define delimiters for use in such
   protocols, but the delimiters are different for each protocols.
   Therefore, the delimiter mapping table should be based on a well-
   defined mapping table for each protocol.

   Delimiter mapping is supposed to map delimiter characters that have
   compatible characters to canonical characters.  For example, '@' in
   mail address or ':' and '/' in URI has width compatible character.
   And '+', '-', '<' and '>' may be such character.  Another example is
   the FULL STOP character (U+002E) which is a delimiter in the visual
   presentation of domain names.  Some IMEs generate semantic or width
   compatible character of FULL STOP such as IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP
   (U+3002) when a user types FULL STOP on the keyboard.  Such FULL STOP
   compatible characters need to be mapped to the FULL STOP before
   passing the string to the protocol.

2.2.  Special mapping

   Aside from delimiter characters, certain protocols have characters
   which need to be mapped in ways that are different from the rules
   specified in the PRECIS framework (e.g., mapping non-ASCII space
   characters to ASCII space).  In this document, these mappings are
   called "special mappings".  They are different for each protocol.
   Therefore, the special mapping table should be based on a well-
   defined mapping table for each protocol.  Examples of special mapping
   are the following;

   o  White spaces are mapped to SPACE (U+0020)

   o  Some characters such as control characters are mapped to nothing
      (Deletion)



YONEYA & NEMOTO        Expires November 25, 2013                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               precis mapping                     May 2013


   As examples, EAP [RFC3748], SASLprep [RFC4013], IMAP4 ACL [RFC4314]
   and LDAPprep [RFC4518] define the rule that some codepoints for non-
   ASCII space are mapped to SPACE (U+0020).

2.3.  Local case mapping

   Local case mapping is case folding that depends on language and
   context.  For example, the mapping of LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049)
   depends on the language context of the user: if the language is
   Turkish (or one of several other languages), the character should be
   mapped into LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I (U+0131) as this character's
   lower case equivalent.

   To solve such problems for PRECIS framework, this document defines
   characters that need local case mapping based on the
   Specialcasing.txt [Specialcasing] file in section 3.13 of The Unicode
   Standard [Unicode].  Local case mapping targets only characters that
   get two different results to perfom just casefolding that is defined
   in the Casefolding.txt [Casefolding] and perfom special casefolding
   that is defined in the Specialcasing.txt then casefolding, because
   PRECIS framework have casefolding.

   There are two types casefoldings defined as Unconditional Mappings
   and Conditional Mappings in the Specialcasing.txt file.  Conditional
   mappings have Language-Insensitive Mappings that target characters
   whose full case mappings do not depend on language, but do depend on
   context.  Language-Sensitive Mappings that these are characters whose
   full case mappings depend on language and perhaps also context.

   Of these mappings, characters with Unconditional Mappings or with
   Language-Insensitive Mappings in Conditional Mappings target are
   mapped into same codepoint(s) with just casefolding or special
   casefolding then casefolding.  But characters with Language-Sensitive
   Mappings in Conditional Mappings targets are mapped into different
   codepoints.  Therefore this document defines characters that are a
   part of characters of Lithuanian(lt), Turkish(tr) and
   Azerbaijanian(az) that Language-Sensitive Mappings targets as targets
   for local case mapping.

   The following are the methods to calculate codepoints that local case
   mapping targets.  Here Casefolding() means casefolding described in
   the Casefolding.txt file [Casefolding] and Specialcasing() means
   specialcasing described in the Specialcasing.txt file
   [Specialcasing].

   If Casefolding(Specialcasing(cp)) != Casefolding(cp)
   Then cp is a target
   Else cp is not a target;

Internet-Draft               precis mapping                     May 2013


   Application developers should calculate codepoints that local case
   mapping targets by using the latest Casefolding.txt and
   Specialcasing.txt.  Appendix B "Code points list for local case
   mapping" lists codepoints in Unicode 6.2 calculated by this method.

3.  Order of operations

   The mappings described in this document are expected to be applied as
   Addtional mapping in the PRECIS framework.  Basically, the mappings
   described in this document describes could be applied in any order.
   However, this section specifies a particular order to minimize the
   effect of codepoint changes introduced by the mappings.  This mapping
   order is very general and was designed to be acceptable to the widest
   user community.

   1.  Delimiter mapping

   2.  Special mapping

   3.  Local case mapping

4.  Open issues

   Followings are current open issues for this document.

   1.  Some protocols requires local case mapping as normative of the
       PRECIS framework.  Is it necessary to define the local case
       mapping in the framework document?  Issue here is that the local
       case mapping is for localizaion and the PRECIS framework is for
       internationalization.  Following to IDNA2008, PRECIS core
       protocol should concentrate to internationalization, and
       localization should be separated from the core protocol (like
       this document).

5.  Security Considerations

   As well as Mapping Characters for IDNA2008 [RFC5895], this document
   suggests creating mappings that might cause confusion for some users
   while alleviating confusion in other users.  Such confusion is not
   covered in any depth in this document.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for the IANA.

   Martin Duerst suggested a need for the case folding about the mapping
   (map final sigma to sigma, German sz to ss,.).

   Joe Hildebrand, John Klensin, Marc Blanchet, Pete Resnick and Peter
   Saint-Andre, et al.  gave important suggestion for this document
   during at WG meeting.
