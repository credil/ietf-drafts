    <section title="Introduction">
	<t>
	  The field of vehicular communications is encompassing a
	  large number of wired and wireless technologies.  In
	  particular, the breakthrough advancements in wide-area
	  cellular telecommunications, the advent of inexpensive
	  hardware, impressively high bandwidth and low-cost data
	  subscription plans make possible new paradigms which put the
	  vehicle at the center of a communications ecosystem.  It can
	  be observed that whereas only in the recent past linking
	  vehicles in a robust manner to a fixed infrastructure
	  represented endeavors available only to top categories, more
	  and more middle category vehicles are announced to take
	  advantage of data connectivity.
	</t>

	<t>
	  Communication protocols used in the fixed and mobile
	  (terminal) Internet can be applied in the scenarios
	  employing vehicles which communicate.  A number of
	  particular aspects make vehicular communications different,
	  not least being the that mobility is the norm, rather than
	  the exception.  At the same time, several protocols
	  developped at IETF are good candidates to form basis of
	  further development of IP protocols for vehicular
	  communications.
	</t>

	<t>
	  The use of Internet protocols in the vehicular scenarios may
	  prove advantageous from several standpoints:
	  <list style='symbols'>
	    <t>
	      immediate availability of a large number of applications
	      with an established customer base.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      scalability: large numbers of inter-communicating
	      vehicles can be accommodated across large distances.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      accessing heterogeneous, mixed and multiple-standard
	      link layer technologies.
	    </t>
	  </list>	  
	</t>

	<t>
	  The context of vehicular communications considers the use of
	  several classes of Internet protocols for vehicular
	  applications.  One particular family of protocols is Mobile
	  IP.  Its salient features characterize well several mobility
	  aspects such as reachability at permanent addresses,
	  seamless handovers and group mobility management.  Earlier
	  documents at IETF idenfitied a number of scenarios and
	  potential requirements for further work towards improving
	  the Mobile IP protocols for a better adaptation in vehicular
	  environments (see for example the draft titled "Automotive
	  Industry Requirements for NEMO Route Optimization" edited
	  in 2009 <xref
	  target="I-D.ietf-mext-nemo-ro-automotive-req"/>.)
	</t>

	<t>
	  A Vehicle-to-Infrastructure scenario (V2I) is a typical
	  setting in which a vehicle uses a long-range wireless
	  interface (cellular, sattelite) to connect to a fixed
	  infrastructure.  As a separate matter, scenarios of
	  Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications consider direct
	  communications between vehicles, without, or with minimal,
	  assistance from the infrastructure.  In areas where wireless
	  coverage is absent, Vehicle-to-Vehicle-to-Infrastructure
	  communications are scenarios where covered vehicles offer
	  access to non covered vehicles, in a multi-hop manner.

      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Scenarios">

      <t>
	Several scenarios of vehicular communications are described.
	We choose a set of illustrative scenarios, described next, and
	then followed by a list of high-level topologies which may be
	considered in terms of IP communications (V2V, V2I, etc.)
      </t>
      <t>
	Scenario 1: A rented car (for instance a autolib as in
	Paris) is (will be) equipped with the car manufacturer
	network (sensors, CAN bus monitoring, infotainement), the
	car rental owner network (accidents detection, geolocation,
	etc.), the insurer network for behavior detection (speed,
	location, distance, etc.), and other stakeholders network
	such as highway company, municipality public service company
	(detection of free parking for instance), etc.  Those
	sub-networks may be interconnected together by one (mobile)
	router that ensures stable IP connectivity.
      </t>

      <t>
	Scenario 2: Because of the wide variety of available
	wireless technologies, the vehicle should dispose of more
	than one wireless interface towards the infrastructure.  In
	city center, Wi-Fi hotspots may provide Internet access at
	crossing roads stops. In the suburbs, Internet Access may
	only be available with LTE or 3G.
      </t>

      <t>
	Scenario 3: An ambulance may need to stream video to the
	main hospital requesting minimum bandwidth during the whole
	operation. The mobile router should consider this
	requirement and prevent other less important traffic from
	the vehicle to have a negative impact on the stream.
      </t>

      <t>
	Scenario 4: 802.11p may support the broadcast of alerts to
	vehicles. If the mobile router hosts a 802.11p interface,
	such alerts should be handled accordingly and routed to the
	right subnetworks.
      </t>

      <t>
	Scenario 5: The vehicle may have a large amount of data to
	transfer to another vehicle but have only an Edge connection
	with the infrastructure.  The transmission of the data may
	be delayed until a WiFi, 3G, or LTE connection becomes
	available.
      </t>

      <t>
	Scenario 6: MANET routing between vehicles may be
	inefficient if the two communicating vehicles are not in
	vicinity. By using geographical information, the mobile
	router may know how to route data towards the destination
	efficiently.
      </t>

      <t>
	Scenario 7: The insurer (generic term), the car
	manufacturer, and other stakeholder do not want to share
	their (private) data. The insurer do not want to let data
	coming from a network where the driver is active to have an
	influence on the reported behavioral information.
      </t>      

      <section title="Intra-Vehicular (V)">
	<t>
	  Within one particular vehicle, an entire network may and
	  will be deployed.  This network is constituted of routers,
	  hosts and other entities configured each with one or several
	  IP addresses.  Devices within vehicles are reachable to
	  other vehicles and to Internet at large.
	</t>

	<t>
	  One illustration of an intra-vehicular network is depicted
	  in the next figure:

	</figure>

	<t>
	  This figure tries to illustrate the complexity of a
	  intra-vehicular network.  Even though the first deployments
	  of intra-vehicular networks were being constructed using a
	  single IP subnet, the most recent advancements propose the
	  use of multiple subnets within one vehicle.
	</t>
	<t>
	  In this example deployment, the moving vehicle holds
	  on-board a Mobile Router.  The MR is in charge of
	  communicating to the outside world.  It is equipped with one
	  or several wireless interfaces towards the outside world
	  (the world 'wireless' should be understood largely as
	  'without wires'; near-field contact-less communications are
	  proposed for vehicular communications as well).
	</t>

	<t>
	  Within a vehicle, a dedicated router (D.Router) is in charge
	  of subnets whose purpose is more application specific.  The
	  applications are typical vehicular, like the applications
	  communicating on CAN (Car Area Network).  This router may
	  also be forwarding packets of less importance (less
	  constrained in terms of real time) which are related to
	  entertainment (e.g. video stream to a screen built into a
	  front seat).
	</t>

	<t>
	  Within one vehicle, there may thus be deployed several IP
	  subnets, with traffic separated, dedicated to particular
	  applications.  The network within a vehicle may be formed by
	  Routers, Switches and Hosts.  It is also very probable that
	  mobile devices carried by passengers connect to the
	  vehicle's network, in a dynamic manner (users would expect
	  and IP session ongoing on their personal terminal to
	  continue working when getting into and outside of a vehicle).
	</t>

	<t>
	  The IP addressing scheme for deployment in a vehicle is not
	  straightforward.  The addresses should follow the pattern of
	  use of applications: constrained applications may need to be
	  separated from the entertainment applications right at the
	  addressing level.  For example, it may be needed to assign
	  ULAs to some devices dedicated to some applications, Global
	  addresses to other devices and link-local addresses on links
	  where communication is local.
	</t>

	<t>
	  The topology of the intra-vehicular network may be
	  interpreted as a multi-stage deployment; the multiplicity of
	  stages is serving to protect against external attacks from
	  the Internet to the inherent mechanisms of the vehicle
	  dedicated CAN.
	</t>

	<t>
	  The Mobile Router deployed in a vehicle is in charge of
	  communications to the outside world.  One example
	  application on the MR is the following: in case that two
	  versions of the IP protocol need to be deployed and
	  interoperable, then the MR may run a proxy HTTP function to
	  allow IPv6 clients on-board to query IPv4 servers in the
	  fixed Internet.
	</t>

	<t>
	  Some scenarios considered for vehicle communications need to
	  take into account that the vehicle is powered by very
	  complex schemes which include power-saving mechanisms as
	  well as eventual power distribution.  It is important to
	  consider mechanisms to wake-up the vehicle by messages
	  coming from the outside network (IP Router Alert, or SMS of
	  LTE).

	<t>
	  In this figure, the wireless link used between the vehicle
	  and the fixed infrastructure is of type 'long range' -
	  typically a cellular link terminal-infrastructure,
	  alternatively named a Wireless Metropolitan Area Network.  A
	  vehicle-to-infrastructure scenario considers often that the
	  vehicle uses a cellular interface attached to an on-board
	  router.
	</t>

	<t>
	  A different V2I scenario involves the use of short-range
	  wireless links between the vehicle and the infrastructure.
	  For example, it is possible to use interfaces of type IEEE
	  802.11b, or 802.11p to connect to a fixed infrastructure,
	  which is itself connected to the Internet.  The first IP hop
	  between the vehicle and the infrastructure is using a
	  short-range communication link.

	</figure>

	<t>
	  In this figure, the wireless link is of type short range.
	  One vehicle uses a interface of kind IEEE 802.11b, for
	  example, and communicates to another vehicle using same kind
	  of interface.  Contrary to cellular links, the short-range
	  wireless links are active in smaller areas (in terms of
	  square meters of area).  Typical examples of short-range
	  wireless links are IEEE 802.11b, or IEEE 802.11p.
	</t>

	<t>
	  There are several possibilities of using short-range
	  wireless between vehicles.  In one scenario, the link uses
	  the ad-hoc mode of operation between the egress interfaces
	  of on-board vehicles.  This works without the use of a fixed
	  infrastructure.  In another scenario, the link may use the
	  'managed' mode of operation between the egress interfaces of
	  on-board vehicles; an Access Point is necessary for this to
	  operate; the Access Point may be elected among one of the
	  vehicles, or it may be deployed in a fixed manner along the
	  road.
	</t>

	<t>
	  A distinctive factor may be constructed between the V2V and
	  the V2I scenarios with respect to fixed infrastructure.  At
	  one extreme, the presence of fixed infrastructure is
	  completely  disallowed for V2V communications, and the
	  short-range communications are completely disallowed between
	  vehicles which perform V2I.  Along the spectrum of
	  scenarios, one scenario is possible where fixed
	  infrastructure is deployed with the goal to support V2V
	  communications but without offering Internet access; this is
	  often the case with the scenarios currently described with
	  IEEE 802.11p.  At another extreme, V2I communications may be
	  realized by building a complete infrastructure with moving
	  vehicles.

	<t>
	  In Vehicle-to-Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2V2I)
	  communications a mix is realized between V2V communications
	  and V2I communications.  For example, a subnet is
	  established between two vehicles in a V2V manner (e.g. using
	  the ad-hoc mode between egress interfaces of on-board
	  routers of vehicles), and one of the vehicles is
	  simultaneously connected to the fixed infrastructure (and to
	  the Internet) using a V2I cellular link.
