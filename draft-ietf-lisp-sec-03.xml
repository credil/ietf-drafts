    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>The Locator/ID Separation Protocol <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-lisp"></xref> defines a set of functions for routers to
      exchange information used to map from non-routable Endpoint Identifiers
      (EIDs) to routable Routing Locators (RLOCs). If these EID-to-RLOC
      mappings, carried through Map-Reply messages, are transmitted without
      integrity protection, an adversary can manipulate them and hijack the
      communication, impersonate the requested EID or mount Denial of Service
      or Distributed Denial of Service attacks. Also, if the Map-Reply message
      is transported unauthenticated, an adversarial LISP entity can overclaim
      an EID-prefix and maliciously redirect traffic directed to a large
      number of hosts. A detailed description of "overclaiming" attack is
      provided in <xref target="I-D.ietf-lisp-threats"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This memo specifies LISP-SEC, a set of security mechanisms that
      provide origin authentication, integrity and anti-replay protection to
      LISP's EID-to-RLOC mapping data conveyed via mapping lookup process.
      LISP-SEC also enables verification of authorization on EID-prefix claims
      in Map-Reply messages, ensuring that the sender of a Map-Reply that
      provides the location for a given EID-prefix is entitled to do so
      according to the EID prefix registered in the associated Map Server.
      Map-Register security, including the right for a LISP entity to register
      an EID-prefix or to claim presence at an RLOC, is out of the scope of
      LISP-SEC. Additional security considerations are described in Section
      6.</t>

    <section anchor="threat-model" title="LISP-SEC Threat Model">
      <t>LISP-SEC addresses the control plane threats, described in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-lisp-threats"></xref>, that target EID-to-RLOC
      mappings, including manipulations of Map-Request and Map-Reply messages,
      and malicious xTR EID overclaiming. However LISP-SEC makes two main
      assumptions that are not part of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-lisp-threats"></xref>. First, the LISP Mapping System
      is expected to deliver Map-Request messages to their intended
      destinations as identified by the EID. Second, no man-in-the-middle
      attack can be mounted within the LISP Mapping System. Furthermore, while
      LISP-SEC enables detection of EID prefix over claiming attacks, it
      assumes that Map Servers can verify the EID prefix authorization at time
      of registration.</t>

      <t>Accordingly to the threat model described in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-lisp-threats"></xref> LISP-SEC assumes that any kind of
      attack, including MITM attacks, can be mounted in the access network,
      outside of the boundaries of the LISP mapping system. An on-path
      attacker, outside of the LISP mapping service system can, for instance,
      hijack mapping requests and replies, spoofing the identity of a LISP
      node. Another example of on-path attack, called over claiming attack,
      can be mounted by a malicious Egress Tunnel Router (ETR), by over
      claiming the EID-prefixes for which it is authoritative. In this way the
      ETR can maliciously redirect traffic directed to a large number of
      hosts.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="operations" title="Protocol Operations">
      <t>The goal of the security mechanisms defined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-lisp"></xref> is to prevent unauthorized insertion of
      mapping data, by providing origin authentication and integrity
      protection for the Map-Registration, and by using the nonce to detect
      unsolicited Map-Reply sent by off-path attackers.</t>

      <t>LISP-SEC builds on top of the security mechanisms defined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-lisp"></xref> to address the threats described in <xref
      target="threat-model"></xref> by leveraging the trust relationships
      existing among the LISP entities participating to the exchange of the
      Map-Request/Map-Reply messages. Those trust relationships are used to
      securely distribute a One-Time Key (OTK) that provides origin
      authentication, integrity and anti-replay protection to mapping data
      conveyed via the mapping lookup process, and that effectively prevent
      over claiming attacks. The processing of security parameters during the
      Map-Request/Map-Reply exchange is as follows:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The ITR-OTK is generated and stored at the ITR, and securely
          transported to the Map-Server.</t>

          <t>The Map-Server uses the ITR-OTK to compute an HMAC that protects
          the integrity of the mapping data provided by the Map-Server to
          prevent overclaiming attacks. The Map-Server also derives a new OTK
          (MS-OTK) that is passed to the ETR, by applying a Key Derivation
          Function (KDF) to the ITR-OTK.</t>

          <t>The ETR uses the MS-OTK to compute an HMAC that protects the
          integrity of the Map-Reply sent to the ITR.</t>

          <t>Finally, the ITR uses the stored ITR-OTK to verify the integrity
          of the mapping data provided by both the Map-Server and the ETR, and
          to verify that no overclaiming attacks were mounted along the path
          between the Map-Server and the ITR.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t><xref target="encap"></xref> provides the detailed description of the
      LISP-SEC control messages and their processing, while the rest of this
      section describes the flow of protocol operations at each entity
      involved in the Map-Request/Map-Reply exchange:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The ITR, upon transmitting a Map-Request message, generates and
          stores an OTK (ITR-OTK). This key is included into the Encapsulated
          Control Message (ECM) that contains the Map-Request sent to the
          Map-Resolver. To provide confidentiality to the ITR-OTK over the
          path between the ITR and its Map-Resolver, the ITR-OTK SHOULD be
          encrypted using a preconfigured key shared between the ITR and the
          Map-Resolver, similar to the key shared between the ETR and the
          Map-Server in order to secure ETR registration <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-lisp-ms"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The Map-Resolver decapsulates the ECM message, decrypts the
          ITR-OTK, if needed, and forwards through the Mapping System the
          received Map-Request and the ITR-OTK, as part of a new ECM message.
          As described in <xref target="map-resolver"></xref>, the LISP
          Mapping System delivers the ECM to the appropriate Map-Server, as
          identified by the EID destination address of the Map-Request.</t>

          <t>The Map-Server is configured with the location mappings and
          policy information for the ETR responsible for the destination EID
          address. Using this preconfigured information the Map-Server, after
          the decapsulation of the ECM message, finds the longest match
          EID-prefix that covers the requested EID in the received
          Map-Request. The Map-Server adds this EID-prefix, together with an
          HMAC computed using the ITR-OTK, to a new Encapsulated Control
          Message that contains the received Map-Request.</t>

          <t>The Map-Server derives a new OTK (MS-OTK) by applying a Key
          Derivation Function (KDF) to the ITR-OTK. MS-OTK is included in the
          Encapsulated Control Message sent to the ETR. To provide MS-OTK
          confidentiality over the path between the Map-Server and the ETR,
          the MS-OTK should be encrypted using the key shared between the ETR
          and the Map-Server in order to secure ETR registration <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-lisp-ms"></xref>.</t>

          <t>If the Map-Server is acting in proxy mode, as specified in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-lisp"></xref>, the ETR is not involved in the
          generation of the Map-Reply. In this case the Map-Server generates
          the Map-Reply on behalf of the ETR as described below.</t>

          <t>The ETR, upon receiving the Encapsulated Map-Request from the
          Map-Server, decrypts the MS-OTK, if needed, and originates a
          Map-Reply that contains the EID-to-RLOC mapping information as
          specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-lisp"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The ETR computes an HMAC over the original LISP Map-Reply, keyed
          with MS-OTK to protect the integrity of the whole Map-Reply. The ETR
          also copies the EID-prefix authorization data that the Map-Server
          included in the Encapsulated Map-Request into the Map-Reply
          message.</t>

          <t>The ITR, upon receiving the Map-Reply, uses the locally stored
          ITR-OTK to verify the integrity of the EID-prefix authorization data
          included in the Map-Reply by the Map-Server. The ITR computes the
          MS-OTK by applying the same KDF used by the Map-Server, and verifies
          the integrity of the Map-Reply. If the integrity checks fail, the
          Map-Reply MUST be discarded. Also, if the EID-prefixes claimed by
          the ETR in the Map-Reply are not equal or less specific than the
          EID-prefix authorization data inserted by the Map-Server, the ITR
          MUST discard the Map-Reply.</t>

        MUST set the S bit in its Map-Register messages.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="itr" title="ITR Processing">
        <t>Upon creating a Map-Request, the ITR generates a random ITR-OTK
        that is stored locally, together with the nonce generated as specified
        in <xref target="I-D.ietf-lisp"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The Map-Request MUST be encapsulated in an ECM, with the S-bit set
        to 1, to indicate the presence of Authentication Data. If the ITR and
        the Map-Resolver are configured with a shared key, the ITR-OTK
        confidentiality SHOULD be protected by wrapping the ITR-OTK with the
        algorithm specified by the OTK Encryption ID field. See <xref
        target="encryption"></xref> for further details on OTK encryption.</t>

        <t>The Requested HMAC ID field contains the suggested HMAC algorithm
        to be used by the Map-Server and the ETR to protect the integrity of
        the ECM Authentication data and of the Map-Reply.</t>

        <t>The KDF ID field, specifies the suggested key derivation function
        to be used by the Map-Server to derive the MS-OTK.</t>

        <t>The EID-AD length is set to 4 bytes, since the Authentication Data
        does not contain EID-prefix Authentication Data, and the EID-AD
        contains only the KDF ID field.</t>

        <t>In response to an encapsulated Map-Request that has the S-bit set,
        an ITR MUST receive a Map-Reply with the S-bit set, that includes an
        EID-AD and a PKT-AD. If the Map-Reply does not include both ADs, the
        ITR MUST discard it. In response to an encapsulated Map-Request with
        S-bit set to 0, the ITR expects a Map-Reply with S-bit set to 0, and
        the ITR SHOULD discard the Map-Reply if the S-bit is set.</t>

        <t>Upon receiving a Map-Reply, the ITR must verify the integrity of
        both the EID-AD and the PKT-AD, and MUST discard the Map-Reply if one
        of the integrity checks fails.</t>

        <t>The integrity of the EID-AD is verified using the locally stored
        ITR-OTK to re-compute the HMAC of the EID-AD using the algorithm
        specified in the EID HMAC ID field. If the EID HMAC ID field does not
        match the Requested HMAC ID the ITR SHOULD discard the Map-Reply and
        send, at the first opportunity it needs to, a new Map-Request with a
        different Requested HMAC ID field, according to ITR's local policy.
        The ITR MUST set the EID HMAC ID field to 0 before computing the
        HMAC.</t>

        <t>To verify the integrity of the PKT-AD, first the MS-OTK is derived
        from the locally stored ITR-OTK using the algorithm specified in the
        KDF ID field. This is because the PKT-AD is generated by the ETR using
        the MS-OTK. If the KDF ID in the Map-Reply does not match the KDF ID
        requested in the Map-Request, the ITR SHOULD discard the Map-Reply and
        send, at the first opportunity it needs to, a new Map-Request with a
        different KDF ID, according to ITR's local policy. The derived MS-OTK
        is then used to re-compute the HMAC of the PKT-AD using the Algorithm
        specified in the PKT HMAC ID field. If the PKT HMAC ID field does not
        match the Requested HMAC ID the ITR SHOULD discard the Map-Reply and
        send, at the first opportunity it needs to, a new Map-Request with a
        different Requested HMAC ID according to ITR's local policy.</t>

        <t>Each individual Map-Reply EID-record is considered valid only if:
        (1) both EID-AD and PKT-AD are valid, and (2) the intersection of the
        EID-prefix in the Map-Reply EID-record with one of the EID-prefixes
        contained in the EID-AD is not empty. After identifying the Map-Reply
        record as valid, the ITR sets the EID-prefix in the Map-Reply record
        to the value of the intersection set computed before, and adds the
        Map-Reply EID-record to its EID-to-RLOC cache, as described in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-lisp"></xref>. An example of Map-Reply record
        validation is provided in <xref target="validation"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The ITR SHOULD send SMR triggered Map Requests over the mapping
        system in order to receive a secure Map-Reply. If an ITR accepts
        piggybacked Map-Replies, it SHOULD also send a Map-Request over the
        mapping system in order to securely verify the piggybacked
        Map-Reply.</t>

        <t></t>

        <section anchor="validation" title="Map-Reply Record Validation">
          <t>The payload of a Map-Reply may contain multiple EID-records. The
          whole Map-Reply is signed by the ETR, with the PKT HMAC, to provide
          integrity protection and origin authentication to the EID-prefix
          records claimed by the ETR. The Authentication Data field of a
          Map-Reply may contain multiple EID-records in the EID-AD. The EID-AD
          is signed by the Map-Server, with the EID HMAC, to provide integrity
          protection and origin authentication to the EID-prefix records
          inserted by the Map-Server.</t>

          <t>Upon receiving a Map-Reply with the S-bit set, the ITR first
          checks the validity of both the EID HMAC and of the PKT-AD HMAC. If
          either one of the HMACs is not valid, a log message is issued and
          the Map-Reply is not processed any further. If both HMACs are valid,
          the ITR proceeds with validating each individual EID-record claimed
          by the ETR by computing the intersection of each one of the
          EID-prefix contained in the payload of the Map-Reply with each one
          of the EID-prefixes contained in the EID-AD. An EID-record is valid
          only if at least one of the intersections is not the empty set.</t>

          <t>For instance, the Map-Reply payload contains 3 mapping record
          EID-prefixes:<list style="empty">
              <t>1.1.1.0/24</t>

              <t>1.1.2.0/24</t>

              <t>1.2.0.0/16</t>
            </list>The EID-AD contains two EID-prefixes: <list style="empty">
              <t>1.1.2.0/24</t>

              <t>1.2.3.0/24</t>
            </list>The EID-record with EID-prefix 1.1.1.0/24 is not processed
          since it is not included in any of the EID-ADs signed by the
          Map-Server. A log message is issued.</t>

          <t>The EID-record with EID-prefix 1.1.2.0/24 is stored in the
          map-cache because it matches the second EID-prefix contained in the
          EID-AD.</t>

          <t>The EID-record with EID-prefix 1.2.0.0/16 is not processed since
          it is not included in any of the EID-ADs signed by the Map-Server. A
          log message is issued. In this last example the ETR is trying to
          over claim the EID-prefix 1.2.0.0/16, but the Map-Server authorized
          only 1.2.3.0/24, hence the EID-record is discarded.</t>

        between the ITR and the Map-Resolver.</t>

        <t>The OTK is encrypted using the algorithm specified in the OTK
        Encryption ID field. When the AES Key Wrap algorithm is used to
        encrypt a 128-bit OTK, according to [RFC3339], the AES Key Wrap
        Initialization Value MUST be set to 0xA6A6A6A6A6A6A6A6 (64 bits). The
        output of the AES Key Wrap operation is 192-bit long. The most
        significant 64-bit are copied in the One-Time Key Preamble field,
        while the 128 less significant bits are copied in the One-Time Key
        field of the LISP-SEC Authentication Data.</t>

        <t>When decrypting an encrypted OTK the receiver MUST verify that the
        Initialization Value resulting from the AES Key Wrap decryption
        operation is equal to 0xA6A6A6A6A6A6A6A6. If this verification fails
        the receiver MUST discard the entire message.</t>

        <t>When a 128-bit OTK is sent unencrypted the OTK Encryption ID is set

        BGP, should be less complex, as ALT is currently small and with a
        limited number of operators. Ultimately, deploying the SIDR
        recommendations in ALT further ensures that the fore mentioned
        assumption is true.</t>

        <t>It is also assumed that no man-in-the-middle attack can be carried
        out against the ALT router to ALT router tunnels, and that the
        information included into the Map-Requests, in particular the OTK,
        cannot be read by third-party entities. It should be noted that the
        integrity of the Map-Request in the ALT is protected by BGP
        authentication, and that in order to provide OTK confidentiality in
        the ALT mapping system the ALT router to ALT router tunnels MAY be
        deployed using IPsec (ESP).</t>

        <t>Map-Register security, including the right for a LISP entity to
        register an EID-prefix or to claim presence at an RLOC, is out of the
        scope of LISP-SEC.</t>

        <t>If the Map-Server and the ETR are colocated, LISP-SEC does not
        provide protection from overclaiming attacks mounted by the ETR.
        However, in this particular case, since the ETR is within the trust
        boundaries of the Map-Server, ETR's overclaiming attacks are not
        included in the threat model.</t>
