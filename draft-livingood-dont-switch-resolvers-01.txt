     In Case of DNSSEC Validation Failures, Do Not Change Resolvers
                draft-livingood-dont-switch-resolvers-01

Abstract

   DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is beginning widespread deployment.
   However, domain signing tools and processes are not yet as mature and
   reliable as is the case for non-DNSSEC-related domain administration
   tools and processes.  As a result, some DNSSEC validation failures
   may occur.  When these failures do occur, end users SHOULD NOT change
   to a non-validating DNS resolver.

Internet-Draft           Do Not Change Resolvers          September 2013


1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS), DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC), and
   related operational practices are defined extensively [RFC1034]
   [RFC1035] [RFC4033] [RFC4034] [RFC4035] [RFC4398] [RFC4509] [RFC6781]
   [RFC5155].

   DNSSEC has now entered widespread deployment.  However, domain
   signing tools and processes are not yet as mature and reliable as is
   the case for non-DNSSEC-related domain administration tools and
   processes.  As a result, some DNSSEC validation failures may occur.
   When these failures do occur, end users SHOULD NOT change to a non-
   validating DNS resolver.


3.  Domain Validation Failures

   A domain name can fail validation for two general reasons, a
   legitimate security failure such as due to an attack or compromise of
   some sort, or as a result of misconfiguration (mistake) on the part
   of an domain administrator.  There is no way for end users to discern
   which of these issues has caused a DNSSEC-signed domain to fail
   validation, and end users should therefore assume that it may be due
   to a legitimate security problem.


4.  Misunderstanding DNSSEC Validation Failures

   End users may incorrectly interpret the failure to reach a domain due
   to DNSSEC-related misconfiguration as their ISP or DNS resolver
   operator purposely blocking access to the domain, or as a
   performance-related failure on the part of their ISP.  In reality,
   these failures may be due to a security issue of which the end user
   is not aware.


5.  Comparison to Other DNS Misconfigurations

   Authoritative DNS-related mistakes and errors typically affect the
   entire Internet, and all DNS recursive resolver operators equally.
   So for example, in an A record is incorrect, an end user would get

   the incorrect record in a DNS response no matter what resolver they
   used.

   In contrast to this, DNSSEC-related mistakes, errors, or validation
   security failures would only affect end users of validating
   resolvers.


6.  Switching to a Non-Validating Resolver is NOT Recommended

   As noted in Section 4 some end users may not understand why a domain
   fails to validate on one network but not another (or with one DNS
   resolver but not another) Section 5.  As a result, they may consider
   switching to an alternative, non-validating resolver themselves.  But
   if a domain fails DNSSEC validation and is inaccessible, this could
   very well be due to a security-related issue.

   As a best practice: In order to be as safe and secure as possible,
   end users SHOULD NOT change to DNS servers that do not perform DNSSEC
   validation as a workaround.

   Even if a website in a domain seems to look "normal" and valid,
   according to the DNSSEC protocol, that domain is not secure.  Domains
   that fail DNSSEC for legitimate reasons may be in control of hackers
   or there could be other significant security issues with the domain.
   Thus, switching to a non-validating resolver to restore access to a
   domain that fails DNSSEC validation is NOT recommended and is
   potentially harmful to end user security.


7.  Other Considerations

7.1.  Security Considerations

   The use of a non-validating DNS recursive resolver has comparatively
   less security capabilities than a validating resolver, since one
   implements DNS Security Extensions and one does not.

   In the case of a DNSSEC validation failure, if an end user changes to
   a non-validating resolver they may subject themselves to increased
   security risks and threats against which DNS Security Extensions may
   have provided protection.

7.2.  Privacy Considerations

   There are no privacy considerations in this document.
