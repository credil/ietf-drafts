          OSPF Extensions to Support Maximally Redundant Trees
                        draft-atlas-ospf-mrt-01

Abstract

   This document specifies extensions to OSPF to support the distributed
   computation of Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT).  Some example uses of
   the MRTs include IP/LDP Fast-Reroute and global protection or live-
   live for multicast traffic.  The extensions indicate what MRT
   profile(s) each router supports.  Different MRT profiles can be
   defined to support different uses and to allow transitioning of
   capabilities.  An extension is introduced to flood MRT-Ineligible
   links, due to administrative policy.

   The need for a mechanism to allow routers to advertise a worst-case
   FIB compute/install time is well understood for controlling
   convergence.  This specification introduces the Controlled
   Convergence TLV to be carried in the Router Information LSA.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the OSPF extensions necessary to support the
   architecture that defines how IP/LDP Fast-Reroute can use MRTs
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture].  At least one common
   standardized algorithm (such as the lowpoint algorithm explained and
   fully documented in [I-D.enyedi-rtgwg-mrt-frr-algorithm]) is required
   so that the routers supporting MRT computation consistently compute
   the same MRTs.  MRT can also be used to protect multicast traffic via

   either global protection or local
   protection.[I-D.atlas-rtgwg-mrt-mc-arch]

   IP/LDP Fast-Reroute using MRTs can provide 100% coverage for link and
   node failures in an arbitrary network topology where the failure
   doesn't split the network.  It can also be deployed incrementally
   inside an OSPF area; an MRT Island is formed of connected supporting
   routers and the MRTs are computed inside that island.

   In the default MRT profile, a supporting router both computes the
   MRTs and creates the necessary transit forwarding state necessary to
   provide the two additional forwarding topologies, known as MRT-Blue
   and MRT-Red.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]

3.  Terminology

   For ease of reading, some of the terminology defined in
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture] is repeated here.

   network graph:   A graph that reflects the network topology where all
      links connect exactly two nodes and broadcast links have been
      transformed into the standard pseudo-node representation.

   Redundant Trees (RT):   A pair of trees where the path from any node
      X to the root R along the first tree is node-disjoint with the
      path from the same node X to the root along the second tree.
      These can be computed in 2-connected graphs.

   Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT):   A pair of trees where the path
      from any node X to the root R along the first tree and the path
      from the same node X to the root along the second tree share the
      minimum number of nodes and the minimum number of links.  Each
      such shared node is a cut-vertex.  Any shared links are cut-links.
      Any RT is an MRT but many MRTs are not RTs.

   MRT Island:   From the computing router, the set of routers that
      support a particular MRT profile and are connected via MRT-
      eligible links.

   GADAG:   Generalized Almost Directed Acyclic Graph - a graph that is
      the combination of the ADAGs of all blocks.  Transforming a
      network graph into a GADAG is part of the MRT algorithm.

Internet-Draft       OSPF Extensions to Support MRT         October 2013


   MRT-Red:   MRT-Red is used to describe one of the two MRTs; it is
      used to described the associated forwarding topology and MT-ID.
      Specifically, MRT-Red is the decreasing MRT where links in the
      GADAG are taken in the direction from a higher topologically
      ordered node to a lower one.

   MRT-Blue:   MRT-Blue is used to describe one of the two MRTs; it is
      used to described the associated forwarding topology and MT-ID.
      Specifically, MRT-Blue is the increasing MRT where links in the
      GADAG are taken in the direction from a lower topologically
      ordered node to a higher one.

4.  Overview of OSPF Extensions for MRT

   There are two separate aspects that need to be advertised in OSPF.
   Both derive from the need for all routers supporting an MRT profile
   to compute the same pair of MRTs to each destination.  By executing
   the same algorithm on the same network graph, distributed routers
   will compute the same MRTs.  Convergence considerations are discussed
   in [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture].

   The first aspect that must be advertised is which MRT profile(s) are
   supported and the associated GADAG Root Selection Priority.  The
   second aspect that must be advertised is any links that are not
   eligible, due to administrative policy, to be part of the MRTs.  This
   must be advertised consistently across the area so that all routers
   in the MRT Island use the same network graph.

4.1.  Supporting MRT Profiles

   An MRT Profile defines the exact MRT Algorithm, the MRT-Red MT-ID,
   the MRT-Blue MT-ID, and the forwarding mechanisms supported for the
   transit MRT-Red and MRT-Blue forwarding topologies.  Finally, the MRT
   Profile defines exact behavioral rules such as:

   o  how reconvergence is handled,

   o  inter-area forwarding behavior,

   A router that advertises support for an MRT Profile MUST provide the
   specified forwarding mechanism for its MRT-Red and MRT-Blue
   forwarding topologies.  A router that advertises support for an MRT
   Profile MUST implement an algorithm that produces the same set of
   MRT-Red and MRT-Blue next-hops for its MRT-Red and MRT-Blue
   topologies as is provided by the algorithm specified in the MRT
   Profile.

Internet-Draft       OSPF Extensions to Support MRT         October 2013


   A router MAY indicate support for multiple MRT Profiles.  A router
   computes its local MRT Island for each separate MRT Profile that the
   router supports.  The MT-IDs used in one supported MRT Profile MUST
   NOT overlap with those MT-IDs used in a different supported MRT
   Profile.  Supporting multiple MRT Profiles provides a mechanism for
   transitioning from one profile to another.  Different uses of MRT
   forwarding topologies may behave better on different MRT profiles.

   The default MRT Profile is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture].  Its behavior is intended to
   support IP/LDP unicast and multicast fast-reroute.

4.2.  GADAG Root Selection

   One aspect of the MRT algorithms is that the selection of the GADAG
   root can affect the alternates and the traffic through that GADAG
   root.  Therefore, it is important to provide an operator with control
   over which router will play the role of GADAG root.  A measure of the
   centrality of a node may help determine how good a choice a
   particular node is.

   GADAG Root selection is done using the GADAG Root Selection Priority
   advertised in the MRT Profile TLV of the Router Information LSA.
   When the MRTs need to be recalculated, the MRT Island is determined.
   Inside the set of routers identified as in the MRT Island, routers
   that are marked as unusable or overloaded (e.g. [RFC3137]) are
   removed from consideration.  Among the remaining routers, the router
   with the highest GADAG Root Selection Priority is picked to be the
   GADAG Root.  If there are multiple at the same priority, then the
   router with the highest Router ID is selected.

4.3.  Triggering an MRT Computation

   When an MRT Computation is triggered, it is triggered for a given MRT
   Profile in a given area.  First, the associated MRT Island is
   determined.  Then, the GADAG Root is selected.  Finally, the actual
   MRT algorithm is run to compute the transit MRT-Red and MRT-Blue
   topologies.  Additionally, the router MAY choose to compute MRT-FRR
   alternates or make other use of the MRT computation results.

   Prefixes can be attached and detached and have their associated MRT-
   Red and MRT-Blue next-hops computed without requiring a new MRT
   computation.

5.  MRT Capability Advertisement

   A router that supports MRT indicates this by setting a newly defined
   M bit in the Router LSA.  If the router provides no other information

   via a separate MRT Profile TLV, then the router supports the default
   MRT Profile with a GADAG Root Selection Priority of 100.

   In addition, a router can advertise a newly defined MRT Profile TLV
   within the scope of the OSPF router information LSA [RFC4970].  This
   TLV also includes the GADAG Root Selection Priority.

5.1.  Advertising MRT Capability in OSPFv2

5.3.  MRT Profile TLV in Router Information LSA

   A router may advertise an MRT Profile TLV to indicate support for
   multiple MRT Profiles, for a non-default MRT Profile, and/or to
   indicate a non-default GADAG Root Selection Priority.  The MRT
   Profile TLV is advertised within the OSPF router information LSA
   [RFC4970]; the RI LSA MUST have area scope.

                 MRT Profile TLV in Router Information LSA

   The GADAG Priority is the GADAG Root Selection Priority associated
   with the advertising router in the MRT Island for the associated MRT
   Profile, as indicated by the Profile ID.  If multiple MRT Profiles
   are supported, then the length of this TLV varies.  The ordering of
   the profiles inside the TLV is not significant.  Multiple appearances
   of this TLV is not an error.

6.  Advertising MRT-ineligible links for MRT

   Due to adminstrative policy, some otherwise eligible links in the
   network topology may need to be excluded from the network graph upon
   which the MRT algorithm is run.  Since the same network graph must be
   used across the area, it is critical for OSPF to flood which links to
   exclude from the MRT calculation.  This is done by introducing a new
   MRT-Ineligible Links TLV to be carried in the Router Information LSA.

   If a link is marked by administrative policy as MRT-Ineligible, then
   a router MUST flood that link in either the MRT-Ineligible TLV or
   OSPFv3 MRT-Ineligible TLV in the Router Information LSA.

   MRT-Ineligible links are specified by the Link ID, Link Data, and
   Type fields, as normally sent in the Router-LSA.  See Section A4.1.2
   of [RFC2328] for descriptions of these fields.

            MRT-Ineligible Links TLV in Router Information LSA

   Multiple links can be flooded as MRT-ineligible by listing them

   relevant.  Multiple appearances of this TLV is not an error.

6.2.  MRT-Ineligible Link TLV for OSPFv3

   Since links are differently represented in OSPFv2 and OSPFv3, an
   OSPFv3 MRT-Ineligible Link TLV is defined.

   An OSPFv3 MRT-Ineligible Link is defined by its Interface ID,
   Neighbor Interface ID, Neighbor Router ID, and Type fields.  See
   Appendix A4.1.3 [RFC5340] for the description of these fields.

7.  Worst-Case Network Convergence Time

   As part of converging the network after a single failure,
   Section 11.2 of [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture] describes the
   need to wait for a configured or advertised period for all routers to
   be using their new SPTs.  Similarly, any work on avoiding micro-
   forwarding loops during convergence[RFC5715] requires determining the
   maximum among all routers in the area of the worst-case route
   computation and FIB installation time.  More details on the specific
   reasoning and need for flooding it are given in
   [I-D.atlas-bryant-shand-lf-timers].


      TYPE:  To Be Allocated by IANA; experimental is 32775
      LENGTH: 4
      VALUE:

      0                   1                   2                   3

      |   Reserved                    |    FIB compute/install time   |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      FIB compute/install time:  This is the worst-case time the router
          may take to compute and install all OSPF routes in the area
          after a change to a stable network.  The value is
          in milliseconds.


           Controlled Convergence TLV in Router Information LSA

   The Controlled Convergence TLV is carried in the Router Information
   LSA and flooded with area-wide scope.  A router MUST compute the
   maximum FIB compute/install time from those flooded in the area.  A
   router MAY use a configured maximum time instead of using and
   flooding the Controlled Convergence TLV.

8.  Backwards Compatibility

Internet-Draft       OSPF Extensions to Support MRT         October 2013


   The MRT capability bit, the MRT Profile, the MRT-Ineligible Link, and
   the OSPFv3 MRT-Ineligible Link TLVs are defined in this document.
   They should not introduce any interoperability issues.  Routers that
   do not support the MRT capability bit in the router LSA SHOULD
   silently ignore it.  Routers that do not support the new MRT-related
   TLVs SHOULD silently ignore them.

8.1.  Handling MRT Capability Changes

   When a router changes from supporting MRT to not supporting MRT, it
   is possible that Router Information LSAs with MRT-related TLVs remain
   in the neighbors' database briefly.  Such MRT-related TLVs SHOULD be
   ignored when the associated Router LSA from that router does not have
   the MRT capability set in its Router LSA.

   When a router changes from not supporting MRT to supporting MRT, it
   will flood its Router LSA(s) with the M-bit set and may send an
   updated Router Information LSA.  If a Router LSA is received with the
   M-bit newly set, an MRT computation SHOULD be scheduled but MAY be
   delayed up to 60 seconds to allow reception of updated related Router
   Information LSAs.  In general, when changes in MRT-related
   information is received, an MRT computation SHOULD be triggered.

   The rationale behind using the M bit in router LSA is to handle the
   MRT capability changes gracefully in case of version upgrade/
   downgrade.  The M bit in router LSA ensures the latest "MRT
   capability" information is available for computation when there is a
   downgrade to the version that doesn't support MRT and RI LSA.

9.  Security Considerations

   This OSPF extension is not believed to introduce new security
   concerns.  It relies upon the security architecture already provided
   for Router LSAs and Router Information LSAs.

10.  IANA Considerations

   Please allocate a value from the OSPF Router Information TLV Types
   [RFC4970] for the MRT Profile TLV, for the MRT-Ineligible Link TLV,
   and for the OSPFv3 MRT-Ineligible Link TLV.

   Please create an MRT Profile registry for the MRT Profile TLV.  The
   range is 0 to 255.  The default MRT Profile has value 0.  Values
   1-200 are by Standards Action.  Values 201-220 are for
   experimentation.  Values 221-255 are for vendor private use.
