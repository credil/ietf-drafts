                 Proposed Plan for Usage of SDP and RTP
                     draft-jennings-rtcweb-plan-01

Abstract

   This draft outlines a bunch of the remaining issues in RTCWeb related
   to how the the W3C APIs map to various usages of RTP and the
   associated SDP.  It proposes one possible solution to that problem
   and outlines several chunks of work that would need to be put into
   other drafts or result in new drafts being written.  The underlying
   design guideline is to, as much as possible, re-use what is already
   defined in existing SDP [RFC4566] and RTP [RFC3550] specifications.

   This draft is not intended to become an specification but is meant
   for working group discussion to help build the specifications.  It is
   being discussed on the rtcweb@ietf.org mailing list though it has
   topics relating to the CLUE WG, MMUSIC WG, AVT* WG, and WebRTC WG at
   W3C.

Internet-Draft                 RTCWeb Plan                 February 2013


1.  Overview

   The reoccurring theme of this draft is that SDP [RFC4566] already has
   a way of solving many of the problems being discussed at the RTCWeb
   WG and we SHOULD not try to invent something new but rather re-use
   the existing methods for describing RTP [RFC3550] media flows.

   The general theory is that, roughly speaking, the m-line corresponds
   to flow of packets that can be handled by the application in the same
   way.  This often results in more m-lines than there are media sources
   such as microphones or cameras.  Forward Error Correction (FEC) is
   done with multiple M-lines as shown in [RFC4756].  Retransmission
   (RTX) is done with multiple m-lines as shown in [RFC4588].  Layered
   coding is done with multiple m-lines as shown in [RFC5583].
   Simulcast, which is really just multiple video stream from the same
   camera, much like layered coding but with no inter m-line dependency,
   is done with multiple m-lines modeled after the Layered coding
   defined in in [RFC5583].

   The significant addition to SDP semantics is an multi-render media
   level attribute that allows a device to indicate that it makes sense
   to simultaneously use multiple stream of video that will be
   simultaneously displayed but share the same SDP characteristics and
   semantics such that they can all be negotiated under a single m-line.
   When using features like RTX, FEC, and Simulcast in a multi-render
   situation, there needs to be a way to correlate a given related media
   flow with the correct "base" media-flow.  This is accomplished by
   having the related flows carry, in the CSRC, the SSRC of their base
   flow.  An example SDP might look like as provided in the example
   Section 7.2.1.

   This draft also propose that advanced usages, including WebRTC to
   WebRTC scenarios, uses a Media Stream Identifier (MSID) that is
   signaled in SDP and also attempts to negotiate the usage of a RTP
   header extension to include the MSID in the RTP packet.  This
   resolves many long term issues.

   This does results in lots of m lines but all the alternatives designs
   resulted in an roughly equivalent number of SSRC lines with a
   possibility of redefining most of the media level attributes.  So
   it's really hard to see the big benefits defining something new over
   what we have.  One of the concerns about this approach is the time to
   collect all the ICE candidates needed for the initial offer.
   Section 7.2.1 provides mitigations to reduce the number of ports
   needed to be the same as an alternative SSRC based design.  This
   assumes that it is perfectly feasible to transport SDP that much
   larger than a single MTU.  The SIP [RFC3261] usage of SDP has
   successfully passed over this long ago.  In the cases where the SDP

   is passed over web mechanisms, it is easy to use compression and the
   size of SDP is more of an optimization criteria than a limiting
   issue.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This draft uses the API and terminology described in [webrtc-api].

   Transport-Flow: An transport 5 Tuple representing the UDP source and
   destination IP address and port over which RTP is flowing.

   5-tuple: A collection of the following values: source IP address,
   source transport port, destination IP address, destination transport
   port and transport protocol.

   PC-Track: A source of media (audio and/or video) that is contained in
   a PC-Stream.  A PC-Track represents content comprising one or more
   PC-Channels.

   PC-Stream: Represents stream of data of audio and/or video added to a
   Peer Connection by local or remote media source(s).  A PC-Stream is
   made up of zero or more PC-Tracks.

   m-line: An SDP [RFC4566] media description identifier that starts
   with "m=" field and conveys following values:media type,transport
   port,transport protocol and media format descriptions.

   m-block: An SDP [RFC4566] media description that starts with an
   m-line and is terminated by either the next m-line or by the end of
   the session description.

   Offer: An [RFC3264] SDP message generated by the participant who
   wishes to initiate a multimedia communication session.  An Offer
   describes participants capabilities for engaging in a multimedia
   session.

   Answer: An [RFC3264] SDP message generated by the participant in
   response to an Offer.  An Answer describes participants capabilities
   in continuing with the multimedia session with in the constraints of
   the Offer.

   This draft avoids using terms that implementors do not have a clear
   idea of exactly what they are - for example RTP Session.

3.  Requirements

   The requirements listed here are a collection of requirements that
   have come from WebRTC, CLUE, and the general community that uses RTP
   for interactive communications based on Offer/Answer.  It does not
   try to meet the needs of streaming usages or usages involving
   multicast.  This list also does not try to list every possible
   requirement but instead outlines the ones that might influence the
   design.

   o  Devices with multiple audio and/or video sources

   o  Devices that display multiple streams of video and/or render
      multiple streams of audio

   o  Simulcast, wherein a video from a single camera is sent in a few
      independent video streams typically at different resolutions and
      frame rates.

   o  Layered Codec such as H.264 SVC

   o  One way media flows and bi-directional media flows

   o  Support asymmetry, i.e. to send a different number of type of
      media streams that you receive.

   o  Mapping W3C PeerConnection (PC) aspects into SDP and RTP.  It is
      important that the SDP be descriptive enough that both sides can
      get the same view of various identifiers for PC-Tracks, PC-Streams
      and their relationships.

   o  Support of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) [RFC5245]

   o  Support of multiplexing multiple media flows, possible of
      different media types, on same 5-tuple.

   o  Synchronization - It needs to be clear how implementations deal
      with synchronization, in particular usages of both CNAME and LS
      group.  The sender needs be able to indicate which Media Flows are
      intended to be synchronized and which are not.

   o  Redundant codings - The ability to send some media, such as the
      audio from a microphone, multiple times.  For example it may be
      sent with a high quality wideband codec and a low bandwidth codec.
      If packets are lost from the high bandwidth steam, the low
      bandwidth stream can be used to fill in the missing gaps of audio.
      This is very similar to simulcast.

Internet-Draft                 RTCWeb Plan                 February 2013


   o  Forward Error Correction - Support for various RTP FEC schemes.

   o  RSVP QoS - Ability to signal various QoS mechanism such Single
      Reservation Flow (SRF) group

   o  Desegregated Media (FID group) - There is a growing desire to deal
      with endpoints that are distributed - for example a video phone
      where the incoming video is displayed on the an IP TV but the
      outgoing video comes from a tablet computer.  This results in
      situations where the SDP sets up a session with not all the media
      transmitted to a single IP address.

   o  In flight change of codec: Support for system that can negotiate
      the uses of more than one codec for a given media flow and then
      the sender can arbitrarily switch between them when they are
      sending but they only send with one codec as at time.

   o  Distinguish simulcast (e.g. multiple encoding of same source) from
      multiple different sources

   o  Support for Sequential and Parallel forking at the SIP level

   o  Support for Early Media

   o  Conferencing environments with Transcoding MCU that decodes/mixes/
      recodes the media

   o  Conferencing environments with Switching MCU where the MCU mucks
      the header information of the media and do not decode/recode all
      the media

4.  Background/Solution Overview

   The basic unit of media description in SDP is the m-line/m-block.
   This allows any entity defined by a single m-block to be individually
   negotiated.  This negotiation applies not only to individual sources
   (e.g., cameras) but also to individual components that come from a
   single source, such as layers in SVC.

   For example, consider negotiation of FEC as defined in [RFC4756].

   Offer

          v=0
          o=adam 289083124 289083124 IN IP4 host.example.com
          s=ULP FEC Seminar
          t=0 0
          c=IN IP4 192.0.2.0
          a=group:FEC 1 2
          a=group:FEC 3 4

          m=audio 30000 RTP/AVP 0
          a=mid:1

          m=audio 30002 RTP/AVP 100
          a=rtpmap:100 ulpfec/8000
          a=mid:2

          m=video 30004 RTP/AVP 31
          a=mid:3

          m=video 30004 RTP/AVP 101
          c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1
          a=rtpmap:101 ulpfec/8000
          a=mid:4

   When FEC is expressed this way, the answerer can selectively accept
   or reject the various streams by setting the port in the m-line to
   zero.  RTX [RFC4588], layered coding [RFC5583], and Simulcast are all
   handled the same way.  Note that while it is also possible to
   represent FEC and SVC using source-specific attributes [RFC5576],
   that mechanism is less flexible because it does not permit selective
   acceptance and rejection as described in [RFC 5576; Section 8].  Most
   deployed systems which implement FEC, layered coding, etc. do so with
   each component on a separate m-line.

   Unfortunately, this strategy runs into problems when combined with
   two new features that are desired for WebRTC:

Internet-Draft                 RTCWeb Plan                 February 2013


   m-line multiplexing (bundle):

      The ability to send media described in multiple media over the
      same 5-tuple.



   multi-render:

      The ability to have large numbers of multiple similar media flows
      (e.g., multiple cameras).  The paradigmatic case here is multiple
      video thumbnails.

   Obviously, this strategy does not scale to large numbers For
   instance, consider the case where we want to be able to transmit 35
   video thumbnails (this is large, but not insane).  In the model
   described above, each of these flows would need its own m-line and
   its own set of codecs.  If each side supports three separate codecs
   (e.g., H.261, H.263, and VP8), then we have just consumed 105 payload
   types, which exceeds the available dynamic payload space.

   In order to resolve this issue, it is necessary to have multiple
   flows (e.g., multiple thumbnails) indicated by the same m-line and
   using the same set of payload types (see Section XXX for proposed
   syntax for this.)  Because each source has its own SSRC, it is
   possible to divide the RTP packets into individual flows.  However,
   this solution still leaves us with two problems:

   o  How to individually address specific RTP flows in order to, for
      instance, order them on a page or display flow-specific captions.

   o  How to determine the relationship between multiple variants of the
      same stream.  For instance, if we have multiple cameras each of
      which is present in a layered encoding, we need to be able to
      determine which layers go together.

   For reasons described in Section 5, the SSRC learned visa SDP is not
   suitable for individually addressing RTP flows.  Instead, we
   introduce a new identifier, the MSID, which can be carried both in
   the SDP and the RTP and therefore can be used to correlate SDP
   elements to RTP elements.  See Section 7.1

   By contrast, we can use RTP-only mechanisms to express the
   correlation between RTP flows: while all the flows associated with a
   given camera have distinct SSIDs, we can use the CSRC to indicate
   which flows belong together.  This is described in Section 7.2

5.  Overall Design

   The basic unit of media description in SDP is the m-line/m-block and
   this document continues with that assumption.  In general, different
   cameras, microphones, etc. are carried on different m-lines.  The
   exceptions to this rule is when using the multi-render extension in
   which case:

   o  Multiple sources which are semantically equivalent and multiplexed
      on a time-wise basis.  For instance, if an MCU mixes multiple
      camera feeds but only some subset is displayed at a time, they can
      all appear on the same m-line.

   By contrast, multiple sources which are semantically distinct cannot
   appear on the same m-line because that does not allow for clear
   negotiation of which sources are acceptable, or which sets of RTP
   SSRCs correspond to which flow.

   The second basic assumption is that SSRCs cannot always be safely
   used to associate RTP flows with information in the SDP.  There are
   two reasons for this.  First, in an offer/answer setting, RTP can
   appear at the offerer before the answer is received; if SSRC
   information from the offerer is required, then these RTP packets
   cannot be interpreted.  The second reason is that RTP permits SSRCs
   to be changed at any time.

   This assumption makes clear why the two exceptions to the "one flow
   per m-line" rule work.  In the case of time-based multiplexing (multi
   render) of camera sources, all the cameras are equivalent from the
   receiver's perspective; he merely needs to know which ones to display
   now and he does that based on which ones have been most recently
   received.  In the case of multiple versions of the same content,
   payload types or payload types plus SSRC can be used to distinguish
   the different versions.

7.  Solutions

   This section outlines a set of rules for the usage of SDP and RTP
   that seems to deal with the various problems and issues that have
   been discussed.  Most of these are not new and are pretty much how
   many systems do it today.  Some of them are new, but all the items
   requiring new standardization work are called out in the Section 9.

   Approach:

   1.   If a system wants to offer to send two sources, such as two
        camera, it MUST use a separate m-block for each source.  The
        means that each PC-Track corresponds to one or more m-blocks.

   2.   In cases such as FEC, simulcast, SVC, each repair stream, layer,
        or simulcast media flow will get an m-block per media flow.

   3.   If a systems wants to receive two streams of video to display in
        two different windows or screens, it MUST use separate m-blocks
        for each unless explicitly signaled to be otherwise (see
        Section 7.2).

   4.   Unless explicitly signaled otherwise (see Section 7.2), if a
        given m-line receives media from multiple SSRCs, only media from
        the most recently received SSRC SHOULD be rendered and other
        SSRC SHOULD NOT and if it is video it SHOULD be rendered in the
        same window or screen.

   5.   If a camera is sending simulcast video and three resolutions,
        each resolution MUST get its own m-block and all the three
        m-blocks will be grouped.  A new SDP group will be defined for
        this.

   6.   If a camera is using a layered codec with three layers, there
        MUST be an m-block for each, and they will be grouped using
        standard SDP for grouping layers.

   7.   To aid in synchronized playback, there is exactly one, and only
        one, LS group for each PC-Stream.  All the m-blocks for all the
        PC-Tracks in a given PC-Stream are synchronized so they are all
        put in one LS group.  All the PC-Tracks in a given PC-Stream
        have the same CNAME.  If a PC-Track appears in more than one PC-
        Stream, then all the PC-Streams with that PC-Track MUST have the
        same CNAME.

   8.   One way media MUST use the sendonly or recvonly attributes.

Internet-Draft                 RTCWeb Plan                 February 2013


   9.   Media lines that are not currently in use but may be used later,
        so that the resources need to be kept allocated, SHOULD use the
        inactive attribute.

   10.  If an m-line will not be used, or it is rejected, it MUST have
        its port set to zero.

   11.  If a video switching MCU produces a virtual "active speaker"
        media flow, that media flow should have its own SSRC but include
        the SSRC of the current speaker's video in the CSRC packets it
        produces.

   12.  For each PC-Track, the W3C API MUST provide a way to set and
        read the CSRC list, set and read the content RFC 4574 "label",
        and read the SSRC of last packet received on a PC-Track.

   13.  The W3C API should have a constraint or API method to allow a
        PC-Stream to indicate the number of multi-render video streams
        it can accept.  Each time a new stream is received up to the
        maximum, a new PC-Track will be created.

   14.  Applications MAY signal all the SSRC they intend to send using
        RFC 5576, but receivers need to be careful in their usage of the
        SSRC in signaling, as the SSRC can change when there is a
        collision and it takes time before that will be updated in
        signaling.

   15.  Applications can get out of band "roster information" that maps
        the names of various speakers or other information to the MSID
        and/or SSRCs that a user is using

   16.  Applications MAY use RFC 4574 content labels to indicate the
        purpose of the video.  The additional content types, main-left
        and main-right, need to be added to support two- and three-
        screen systems.

   17.  The CLUE WG might want to consider SDP to signal the 3D location
        and field of view parameters for captures and renderers.

   18.  The W3C API allows a "label" to be set for the PC-Track.  This
        MUST be mapped to the SDP label attribute.

7.1.  Correlation and Multiplexing

   The port number that RTP is received on provides the primary
   mechanism for correlating it to the correct m-line.  However, when
   the port does not uniquely male the RTP packet to the correct m-block
   (such as in multiplexing and other cases), the next thing that can be



Jennings                 Expires August 29, 2013               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                 RTCWeb Plan                 February 2013


   looked at is the PT number.  Finally there are cases where SSRC can
   be used if that was signaled.

   There are some complications when using SSRC for correlation with
   signaling.  First, the offerer may end up receiving RTP packets
   before receiving the signaling with the SSRC correlation information.
   This is because the sender of the RTP chooses the SSRC; there is no
   way for the receiver to signal how some of the bits in the SSRC
   should be set.  Numerous attempts to provide a way to do this have
   been made, but they have all been rejected for various reasons, so
   this situation is unlikely to change.  The second issue is that the
   signaled SSRC can change, particularly in collision cases, and there
   is no good way to know when SSRC are changing, such that the
   currently signaled SSRC usage maps to the actual RTP SSRC usage.
   Finally SSRC does not always provide correlation information between
   media flows - take for example trying to look at SSRC to tell that an
   audio media flow and video media flow came from the same camera.  The
   nice thing about SSRC is that they are also included in the RTP.

   The proposal here is to extend the MSID draft to meet these needs:
   each media flow would have a unique MSID and the MSID would have some
   level of internal structure, which would allow various forms of
   correlation, including what WebRTC needs to be able to recreate the
   MS-Stream / MS-Track hierarchy to be the same on both sides.  In
   addition, this work proposes creating an optional RTP header
   extension that could be used to carry the MSID for a media flow in
   the RTP packets.  This is not absolutely needed for the WebRTC use
   cases but it helps in the case where media arrives before signaling
   and it helps resolve a broader category of web conferencing use
   cases.

   The MSID consists of three things and can be extended to have more.
   It has a device identifier, which corresponds to a unique identifier
   of the device that created the offer; one or more synchronization
   context identifiers, which is a number that helps correlate different
   synchronized media flows; and a media flow identifier.  The
   synchronization identifier and flow identifier are scoped within the
   context of the device identifier, but the device identifier is
   globally unique.  The suggested device identifier is a 64-bit random
   number.  The synchronization group is an integer that is the same for
   all media flows that have this device identifier and are meant to be
   synchronized.  Right now there can be more than one synchronization
   identifier, but the open issues suggest that one would be preferable.
   The flow identifier is an integer that uniquely identifies this media
   flow within the context of the device identifier.

   Open Issues: how to know if the MSID RTP Header Extension should be
   included in the RTP?

Internet-Draft                 RTCWeb Plan                 February 2013


   An example MSID for a device identifier of 12345123451234512345,
   synchronization group of 1, and a media flow id of 3 would be:

      a=msid:12345123451234512345 s:1 f:3

   When the MSID is used in an answer, the MSID also has the remote
   device identifier included.  In the case where the device ID of the
   device sending the answer was 22222333334444455555, the MSID would
   look like:

      a=msid:22222333334444455555 s:1 f:3 r:12345123451234512345

   Note: The 64 bit size for the device identifier was chosen as it
   allows less than a one in a million chance of collision with greater
   than 10,000 flows (actually it allows this probability with more like
   6 million flows).  Much smaller numbers could be used but 32 bits is
   probably too small.  More discussion on the size of this and the
   color of the bike shed is needed.

   When used in the WebRTC context, each PeerConnection should generate
   a unique device identifier.  Each PC-Stream in the PeerConnection
   will get a a unique synchronization group identifier, and each PC-
   Track in the Peer Connection will get a unique flow identifier.
   Together these will be used to form the MSID.  The MSID MUST be
   included in the SDP offer or answer so that the WebRTC connection on
   the remote side can form the correct structure of remote PC-Streams
   and PC-Tracks.  If a WebRTC client receives an Offer with no MSID
   information and no LS group information, it MUST put all the remote
   PC-Tracks into a single PC-Stream.  If there is LS group information
   but no MSID, a PC-Stream for each LS group MUST be created and the
   PC-Tracks put in the appropriate PC-Stream.

   The W3C specs should be updated to have the ID attribute of the MS-
   Stream be the MSID with no flow identifier, and the ID attribute of
   the MS-Track be the MSID.

   In addition, the SDP will attempt to negotiate sending the MSID in
   the RTP using a RTP Header Extension.  WebRTC clients SHOULD also
   include the a=ssrc attributes if they know which SSRC they plan to
   send but they can not rely on this not changing, being compete, or
   existing in all offers or answers they receive - particularly when
   working with SIP endpoints.

   When using multiplexing, the SDP MUST be distinct enough where the
   combination of payload type number and SSRC allows for unique
   demultiplexing of all the media on the same transport flow without
   use of MSID though the MSID can help in several use cases.

7.2.  Multiple Render

   There are cases - such as a grid of security cameras or thumbnails in
   a video conference - where a receiver is willing to receive and
   display several media flows of video.  The proposal here is to create
   a new media level attribute called multi-render that includes an
   integer that indicates how many streams can be rendered at the same
   time.

   As an example of a m-block, a system that could display 16 thumbnails
   at the same time and was willing to receive H261 or H264 might offer

   Offer

    m=video 52886 RTP/AVP 98 99
    a=multi-render:16
    a=rtpmap:98 H261/90000
    a=rtpmap:99 H264/90000
    a=fmtp:99 profile-level-id=4de00a;
           packetization-mode=0; mst-mode=NI-T;
           sprop-parameter-sets={sps0},{pps0};

   When combining this multi-render feature with multiplexing, the
   answer will might not know all the SSRCs that will be send to this
   m-block so it is best to use payload type (PT) numbers that are
   unique for the SDP: the demultiplexing may have to only use the PT if
   the SSRCs are unknown.

   The intention is that the most recently sent SSRC are the ones that
   are rendered.  Some switching MCU will likely only send the correct
   number of SSRC and not change the SSRC but will instead update the
   CSRC as the switching MCU select a different participant to include
   in the particular video stream.

   The receiver displays, in different windows, the video from the most
   recent 16 SSRC to send video to m-block.

   This allows a switching MCU to know how many thumbnail type streams
   would be appropriate to send to this endpoint.

7.2.1.  Complex Multi Render Example

   The following shows a single multi render m-line that can display up
   to three video streams, and send 3 streams, and support 2 layers of
   simulcast with FEC on the high resolution layer and bundle.  Note
   that only host candidates are provided for the FEC and lower
   resolution simulcast so if the device is behind a NAT, those streams
   will not be used.

7.3.  Dirty Little Secrets

   If SDP offer/answers are of type AVP or AVPF but contain a crypto of
   fingerprint attribute, they should be treated as if they were SAVP or
   SAVPF respectively.  The Answer should have the same type as the
   offer but for all practical purposes the implementation should treat
   it as the secure variant.

   If SDP offer/answers are of type AVP or SAVP, but contain an
   a=rtcp-fb attribute, they should be treated as if they were AVPF or
   SAVPF respectively.  The SDP Answer should have the same type as the
   Offer but for all practical purposes the implementation should treat
   it as the feedback variant.

   If an SDP Offer has both a fingerprint and a crypto attribute, it
   means the Offerer supports both DTLS-SRTP and SDES and the answer
   should select one and return an Answer with only an attribute for the
   selected keying mechanism.

   These may not look appealing but the alternative is to make cap-neg
   mandatory to implement in WebRTC.

7.4.  Open Issues

   What do do with unrecognized media received at W3C PerrConnection
   level?  Suggestion is it creates a new track in whatever stream the
   MSID would indicate if present and the default stream if no MSID
   header extension in the RTP.

7.5.  Confusions

   You can decrypt DTLS-SRTP media before receiving an answer, you can't
   determine if it is secure or not till you have the fingerprint and
   have verified it

   You can use RTCP-FB to do things like PLI without signaling the SSRC.
   The PLI packets gets the sender SSRC from the incoming media that is
   trying to signal the PLI for.

8.  Examples

   Example of a video client joining a video conference.  The client can
   produce and receive two streams of video, one from the slides and the
   other of the person.  The video of the person is synchronized with
   the audio.  In addition, the client can display up to 10 thumbnails
   of video.  The main video is simulcast at HD size and a thumbnail
   size.

9.  Tasks

   This section outlines work that needs to be done in various
   specifications to make the proposal here actually happen.

   Tasks:

   1.   Extend the W3C API to be able to set and read the CSRC list for
        a PC-Track.

   2.   Extend the W3C API to be able to read SSRC of last RTP packed
        received.

   3.   Write an RTP Header Extension draft to cary the MSID.

   4.   Fix up MSID draft to align with this proposal.

   5.   Write a draft to add left, right to the SDP content attribute.
        Add the stuff to the W3C API to read and write this on a track.

   6.   Write a draft on SDP "SIMULCAST" group to signal multiple
        m-block as are simulcast of same video content.

   7.   Complete the bundle draft.

   8.   Provide guidance for ways to use SDP for reduced glare when
        adding of one way media streams.

   9.   Write a draft defining the multi render attribute.

   10.  Change W3C API to say that a PC-Track can be in only one
        PeerConnection or make an object inside the PeerConnection for
        each track in the PC that can be used to set constraints and
        settings and get information related to the RTP flow.

   11.  Sort out how to tell a PC-Track, particularly one meant for
        receiving information, that it can do simulcast, layered coding,
        RTX, FEC, etc.

13.  Open Issues

   The overall solution is complicated considerably by the fact that
   WebRTC allows a PC-Track to be used in more than one PC-Stream but
   requires only one copy of the RTP data for the track to be sent.  I
   am not aware of any use case for this and think it should be removed.
   If a PC-Track needs to be synchronized with two different things,
   they should all go in one PC-Stream instead of two.

14.  Existing SDP

   The following shows some examples of SDP today that any new system
   needs to be able to receive and work with in a backwards compatible
   way.

        a=rtpmap:31 H261/90000
        a=rtpmap:32 MPV/90000


   This means that a sender can switch back and forth between H261 and
   MVP without any further signaling.  The receiver MUST be capable of
   receiving both formats.  At any point in time, only one video format
   is sent, thus implying that only one video is meant to be displayed.
