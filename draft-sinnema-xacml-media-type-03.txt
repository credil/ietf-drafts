Internet-Draft              XACML Media Type                    May 2013


1.  Introduction

   The eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) [XACML-3]
   defines an architecture and a language for access control
   (authorization).  The language consists of requests, responses, and
   policies.  Clients sends a request to a server to query whether a
   given action should be allowed.  The server evaluates the request
   against the available policies and returns a reponse.  The policies
   implement the organization's access control requirements.


2.  XACML Media Type

   This specification registers an XML-based media type for the
   eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) that will be
   registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
   following the "Media Type Specifications and Registration Procedures"
   [RFC6838].  The XACML media type represents an XACML request,
   response, or policy in the XML-based format defined by the core XACML
   specification [XACML-3].


3.  XACML Media Type application/xacml+xml

   This specification requests the registration of an XML-based media
   type for the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML).

3.1.  Media Type Name

   application

3.2.  Subtype Name

   xacml+xml

3.3.  Required Parameters

   none

3.4.  Optional Parameters

   charset: The charset parameter is the same as the charset parameter
   of application/xml [RFC3023].

   version: The version parameter indicates the version of the XACML
   specification.  It can be used for content negotiation when dealing
   with clients and servers that support multiple XACML versions.  Its
   range is the range of published XACML versions.  As of this writing

Internet-Draft              XACML Media Type                    May 2013


   that is: 1.0 [XACML-1], 1.1 [XACML-1.1], 2.0 [XACML-2], and 3.0
   [XACML-3].  These and future version identifiers consist of a series
   of non-negative decimal numbers with no leading zeros separated by
   dots, where the first decimal must be positive.  If this parameter is
   not specified by the client, the server is free to return any version
   it deems fit.  If a client cannot or does not want to deal with that,
   it should explicitly specify a version.

3.5.  Encoding Considerations

   Same as for application/xml [RFC3023].

3.6.  Security Considerations

   Per their specification, application/xacml+xml typed objects do not
   contain executable content.  However, these objects are XML-based,
   and thus they have all of the general security considerations
   presented in section 10 of RFC 3023 [RFC3023].

   XACML [XACML-3] contains information whose integrity and authenticity
   is important - identity provider and service provider public keys and
   endpoint addresses, for example.  Sections 9.2.1 Authentication and
   9.2.4 Policy integrity in XACML [XACML-3] describe requirements and
   considerations for such authentication and integrity protection.

   To counter potential issues, the publisher may sign application/
   xacml+xml typed objects.  Any such signature should be verified by
   the recipient of the data - both as a valid signature, and as being
   the signature of the publisher.  The XACML v3.0 XML Digital Signature
   Profile [XACML-3-DSig] describes how to use XML-based digital
   signatures with XACML.

   Additionally, various of the possible publication protocols, for
   example HTTPS, offer means for ensuring the authenticity of the
   publishing party and for protecting the policy in transit.

   For a more detailed discussion of XACML policy and its security
   considerations, please see XACML 3.0 [XACML-3] and the associated XML
   Digital Signature Profile [XACML-3-DSig].

3.7.  Interoperability Considerations

   Different versions of XACML use different XML namespace URIS:

   o  1.0 & 1.1 use the urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:policy XML
      namespace URI for policies, and the
      urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:context XML namespace URI for
      requests and responses

Internet-Draft              XACML Media Type                    May 2013


   o  2.0 uses the urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:2.0:policy XML namespace URI
      for policies, and the urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:2.0:context XML
      namespace URI for requests and responses

   o  3.0 uses the urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:core:schema:wd-17 XML
      namespace URI for policies, requests, and responses

   Signed XACML has a wrapping SAML 2.0 assertion [SAML-2], which uses
   the urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion namespace URI.
   Interoperability with SAML is defined by the SAML 2.0 Profile of
   XACML [XACML-3-SAML] for all versions of XACML.

3.8.  Applications which use this media type

   Potentially any application implementing or using XACML, as well as
   those applications implementing or using specifications based on
   XACML.

3.9.  Magic number(s)

   In general, the same as for application/xml [RFC3023].  In
   particular, the XML document element of the returned object will be
   one of xacml:Policy, xacml:PolicySet, context:Request, or context:
   Response.  The xacml and context prefixes differ for the various
   versions of XACML as follows:

   o  1.0 & 1.1: The xacml prefix maps to
      urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:policy, the context prefix maps to
      urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:context

   o  2.0: The xacml prefix maps to urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:2.0:policy,
      the context prefix maps to urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:2.0:context

   o  3.0: Both the xacml and context prefixes map to the namespace URI
      urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:core:schema:wd-17

   For signed XACML [XACML-3-DSig], the XML document element is saml:
   Assertion, where the saml prefix maps to the SAML 2.0 namespace URI
   urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion [SAML-2]

3.10.  File extension(s)

   none

3.11.  Macintosh File Type Code(s)

   none
