            <t>
	      This document is a problem statement for a Trust Router
	      Protocol.  A Trust Router Protocol is needed to support
	      large, multihop ABFAB federations, without the need for
	      credentials to be configured for every pair of Identity
	      Providers and Relying Parties.
            </t>
        </abstract>

        <section title="Introduction">
	    <t>
	      The ABFAB architecture
	      <xref target="I-D.lear-abfab-arch" /> describes an
	      access management model that enables the application of
	      federated identity within a broad range of use cases.
	      This is achieved by building on proven technologies and
	      widely deployed infrastructures.  Some of these use
	      cases are described in
	      <xref target="I-D.ietf-abfab-usecases" />.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      In the canonical case, an ABFAB transaction only implies
	      two organizations: an Identity Provider (IdP) and a Relying
	      Party (RP). In this simplest case of a bilateral connection,
	      the amount of configuration needed by both partners is
	      very small; probably just an AAA credential and the peer
	      system's host name for the other party.
 	    </t>
	    <t>
	      However, in practice an organization may have more than
	      one partner. In the case where bilateral connections are
	      used, the amount of configuration at each partner
	      increases in proportion to the number of connections. As
	      the number of partners increases, the amount of
	      configuration churn may become too onerous to manage.
	      Also, the operational costs of managing that
	      configuration information is borne, to an unreasonable
	      degree, by the RPs.  When a new IdP is added to a
	      partnership, it is necessary for all of the RPs to
	      update their configuration information before the new
	      IdP's users will have full access to the services
	      accessible to the partnership.
 	    </t>
	    <t>
	      This document is a problem statement for a Trust Router
	      Protocol.  A Trust Router Protocol is needed to
	      eliminate the need the need for a bilateral exchange of
	      credentials between each IdP and RP.
	    </t>
            <t>
	      A Trust Router Protocol allows a new partner to be added
	      to an ABFAB partnership by peering with any member of
	      the Trust Router network, instead of requiring
	      configuration changes by every partner who may wish to
	      connect with the new partner.  A Trust Router protocol
	      addresses the problems described in this document by
	      distributing information about existing trust
	      relationships within the partnership, thus avoiding the
	      operational costs and limitations of using a Public Key
	      Infrastructure (PKI).
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      This document is broken into two sections: High-Level
	      Problems and Specific Problems.  The High-Level Problems
	      section describes the problems that the Trust Router
	      Protocol has been designed to address at a conceptual
	      level, and the Specific Problems section discusses a
	      more concrete set of problems that the Trust Router
	      Protocol is intended to address.

	<section title="High-Level Problems">
          <section title="Connecting your Partners">
	    <t>
	      Organizations want to be able to connect to an arbitrary
	      number of partners without being overwhelmed by
	      configuration management of many bilateral connections.
	    </t>
          </section>        
          <section title="Identifying your Partners ">        
	    <t>
		It is not generally sufficient to simply configure a
		partner. In most cases, it is also necessary for
		organizations to have confidence that the
		configuration that they have for their partner(s)
		actually corresponds to their partner(s) and is not,
		for example, an attacker claiming to be their partner.
		Unfortunately identifying partners and binding them
		cryptographically to the corresponding configuration
		can be very expensive.
	    </t>
	    <t>
		Organizations want to minimise the cost of validating
		their partners' identities, and of proving their own
		identity to their partners.
	    </t>
          </section>        
          <section title="Knowing your Partners">        
	    <t>
		Organizations and their partners generally interact
		within the context of a particular context. The
		context can be established in a number of ways; for
		example:
		<list style="symbols">
		  <t>
		    A pair of organization may have a formal business
		    relationship that unambiguously establishes the
		    nature of the relationship between the partners
		    (for example, in the case of a supplier's
		    relationship with a customer). In this case, the
		    customer's ABFAB-based interactions with the
		    supplier are governed by this business
		    relationship.
		  </t>
		  <t>
		    A group of organization may also share a formal
		    business relationship (for example, a number of
		    suppliers within a manufacturer's supply
		    chain). In this case, the business relationship
		    might govern the ABFAB-based interactions between
		    the suppliers, and the suppliers and the
		    manufacturer.
		  </t>
		  <t>
		    A group of organizations may not share a formal
		    business relationship but instead share common
		    best practices. In this case, the best practices
		    might govern the ABFAB-based interactions between
		    these organizations.
		  </t>
		</list>
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Given the potential diversity of contexts, organizations
	      need to know which context is in force for a particular
	      ABFAB-based transaction and apply policy that
	      controls which entities within an organization are
	      permitted to operate within particular business
	      contexts.
	    </t>
          </section>        
          <section title="Policing and Managing Policy">        
	    <t>
	      Organizations want to have effective tools for policing
	      and managing policies controlling ABFAB-based
	      transactions with their partners.
	    </t>
          </section>        
        </section>
	<section title="Specific Problems">
	  <section title="Many IdPs, Many RPs">
	    <t>
	      It is fairly easy to see how ABFAB, without Trust
	      Routers, could be deployed in a small federation with
	      stable membership, or even in a large federation with a
	      single RP that provides services to all of the other
	      members, such as an industry consortium.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      However, there are operational problems that arise when
	      ABFAB is used in a federation with a large number of RPs
	      providing services to an even larger number of IdPs.  In
	      these cases, it can be challenging to manage the
	      credentials that need to be exchanged, and manually
	      configured, between each RP/IdP pair.
	    </t>
	  </section>
	  <section title="Frequent Changes in Membership">
	    <t>
	      It must be possible to support changes in membership
	      (adding new partners, or removing former partners) with
	      minimal operational effort, and without requiring manual
	      configuration changes that could result in new partners
	      having delayed or incomplete access to services, or
	      former partners retaining some access to services beyond
	      the end of their membership.
	    </t>
	  </section>
	  <section title="Minimal Costs for Adding a New Partner">
	    <t>
	      There is a need to support large federations in a
	      cost-effective manner.  This includes minimizing the
	      operational costs of adding a new member (either an IdP
	      or RP) to an existing partnership.  Without Trust
	      Router, the operational costs of adding a new member to
	      an existing partnership might be quite high -- requiring
	      credential exchange between a large number of parties,
	      and requiring manual configuration changes on a large
	      number of different systems.
	    </t>
	  </section>
	  <section title="Costs Incurred by the Party that Benefits">
	    <t>
	      Without Trust Routers, a high portion of the operational
	      cost related to adding and removing partners is born by
	      the RPs, who need to maintain bilateral credentials for
	      each IdP whose users can access the services provided by
	      the RP.  This is fine in a case where a single RP
	      provides services to a group of IdPs that pay for
	      membership in the group or pay for access to the
	      services, but in a less-centralized partnership the costs
	      of exchanging credentials with each IdP could
	      serve as a disincentive for organizations to provide
	      services to the partnership and/or result in cases where
	      an RP is unwilling or unable to incur the costs of
	      providing access to new members.  Therefore, it is
	      important that we devise a mechanism where the
	      operational costs are distributed to the organizations
	      that are receiving benefit from incurring the costs.
	    </t>
	  </section>
	  <section title="Deployment Challenges with Public Key Infrastructure">
	    <t>
	      Deployment problems with Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) 
	      make it unsuitable for use by many ABFAB federations.  The costs
	      are prohibitive for the use of ABFAB federations in many 
	      educational environments, the policies of PKI Certificate
	      Authorities are not well-aligned with the policies of many
	      membership organizations.  Also, the support costs associated
	      with having every every IdP generate keys and provide a public
	      key (but not their private key) to each RP in a partnership
	      may be prohivitive.
