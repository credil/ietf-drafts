             Interoperability Impacts of IPv6 Interworking
                 with Existing IPv4 SIP Implementations
               draft-klatsky-dispatch-ipv6-impact-ipv4-01

Abstract

   This document captures potential impacts to IPv4 SIP implementations
   when interworking with IPv6 SIP implementations.  Although some
   amount of interworking translation will occur at the network and
   application layers, an IPv4 SIP application may still encounter a SIP
   message with some IPv6 values in it, resulting in unforeseen error
   conditions.  Such potential scenarios will be identified in this
   document so that SIP application developers can define solutions to
   handle these cases.  Note, this document is not intended to be an
   exhaustive list, rather to provide an overview of some of the more
   commonly encountered potential scenarios.

Internet-Draft      IPv4/IPv6 Interoperability in SIP          July 2013


1.  Introduction

   The continued proliferation of IPv6 infrastructure deployments has
   resulted in more IPv6 Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agents
   (UAs) being turned up on the network.  Considering the large deployed
   install base of IPv4 SIP UAs developed prior to the widespread
   deployment of IPv6, it is a well known fact that not all IPv4 SIP UAs
   have taken into account all possible IPv4 SIP-to-IPv6 SIP
   interoperability considerations at the time of their development.
   The scenarios outlined in this document are intended as guidance for
   application developers to help identify solutions to resolve the
   identified interoperability challenges.

2.  Terminology and Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   RFC 3261 [RFC3261] defines additional terms used in this document
   that are specific to the SIP domain such as "proxy"; "registrar";
   "redirect server"; "user agent server" or "UAS"; "user agent client"
   or "UAC"; "back-to-back user agent" or "B2BUA"; "dialog";
   "transaction"; "server transaction".

   This document uses the term "SIP Server" that is defined to include
   the following SIP entities: user agent server, registrar, redirect
   server, a SIP proxy in the role of user agent server, and a B2BUA in
   the role of a user agent server.

   This document also uses the following terminology to make clear
   distinction between SIP entities supporting only IPv4, only IPv6 or
   supporting both IPv4 and IPv6.

   IPv4-only UA/UAC/UAS:  An IPv4-only UA/UAC/UAS supports SIP signaling
      and media only on the IPv4 network.  It does not understand IPv6
      addresses.

   IPv6-only UA/UAC/UAS:  An IPv6-only UA/UAC/UAS supports SIP signaling
      and media only on the IPv6 network.  It does not understand IPv4
      addresses.

   IPv4/IPv6 UA/UAC/UAS:  A UA/UAC/UAS that supports SIP signaling and
      media on both IPv4 and IPv6 networks; such a UA/UAC/UAS is known
      (and will be referred to in this document) as a "dual-stack"
      [RFC4213] UA/UAC/UAS.

3.  Potential IPv4/IPv6 Interoperability Failure Scenarios

3.1.  IPv6 Address Handling in Via Headers

   As an IPv6 SIP message makes its way through the network, the Via
   header is updated and includes specific IPv6 addresses of IPv6 nodes
   that it has traversed.  If the message arrives at an IPv4-only UAS it
   may still contain those IPv6 addresses in the Via header.  Presumably
   the topmost Via header references an IPv4 address or a Fully
   Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) resolvable to any IPv4 address.  In this
   case the IPv4-only UAS is able to send its response on to its next
   hop, otherwise the message would not have made it to the IPv4-only UA
   at all.  The challenge for the IPv4-only UA then becomes to not
   generate an error even if the other Via headers that it does not need
   to act upon contain IPv6 addresses.

3.2.  IPv6 Address Handling in Record-Route and Route Headers

   Similar to the concerns of having IPv6 addresses in the Via headers,
   IPv4 SIP UAS may also encounter Record-Route headers that contain
   IPv6 addresses of IPv6 nodes the SIP message has traversed.  It is
   again assumed that if the SIP message arrives at an IPv4-only UA that
   the topmost Record-Route header references an IPv4 address or a FQDN
   resolvable to any IPv4 address, such that the response may be routed
   back to a node reachable by the IPv4-only UAS.  In this instance the
   IPv4-only UA should not generate an error when parsing the IPv6
   addresses.  Additionally, the IPv4-only UA may also need to populate
   the Route header in the response that includes the IPv6 addresses
   learned from previously received Record-Route header, and again do so
   without generating an error.

3.3.  IPv6 Address Handling in From / To / Contact Headers

   Another scenario with possible IPv6-to-IPv4 interoperability
   implications is the case where the IPv4-only UAS receives an IPv6
   address in the Contact header and no Record-Route header.  Since this
   represents the peer's reachable contact IP, it may not have been
   modified by any interworking element in the communications path.  The
   IPv4-only UAS will have to send its requests through its outbound SIP
   server, and not generate an error upon receipt of a message with this
   IPv6 information.

   In addition, using an IP address instead of domain in To and/or From
   headers may impact communication, as the From header is used for
   other communication sessions or added to a phone book.

3.4.  IPv6 Address Handling in SDP Body




Klatsky, et al.         Expires January 10, 2014                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft      IPv4/IPv6 Interoperability in SIP          July 2013


   IPv4-only UASs may also receive SDP offers with IPv6 addresses in the
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] portion of the message.
   An IPv6 address can appear in multiple places in the SDP, such as the
   o= line, c= line or a= lines (for Interactive Connectivity
   Establishment (ICE) [RFC5245] attributes).  A working assumption is
   that minimally the c= line will reference an IPv4 address of a media
   interworking element to allow the media communications being
   established by this session to work.  Nonetheless the IPv4-only UAS
   needs be aware and properly handle any IPv6 addresses that may be
   within the received SDP.

3.5.  IPv6 Address Handling in 'reginfo' XML Registration Information
      Document

   There may be instances where an IPv4-only UAC subscribes to the
   registration event package [RFC3680] as a "watcher" for a specific
   entity, to be informed of registration state changes for that entity.
   The "watcher" may have no knowledge of the IP address family in use
   on the "watched" entity, and it is possible that a NOTIFY indicating
   an IPv6 address in the Extensible Markup Language (XML) [XML] body is
   received.  The "watcher" needs to properly parse such a NOTIFY and
   provide the status update of the "watched" entity to the user or
   system that requested the information.

3.6.  IPv6 Address Handling in 30x Redirect

   There may be scenarios where an IPv4-only UAC receives a 30x redirect
   message in response to a request it has sent.  This 30x message may
   contain a Contact header with an IPv6 address.  This is the case
   where the call is being redirected to an IPv6-only UAS.  Since this
   represents the peer's reachable contact IP, it may not have been
   modified by any interworking element in the communications path.

   If the UAC has a configured outbound proxy the new call will be setup
   to that proxy.  If that proxy is not dual stack, the call will fail.
   If there's no outbound proxy configured, the call will fail.  If the
   UAC is a soft phone or hard phone, an error message should be
   displayed.

3.7.  IPv6 Address Handling in REFER-based Transfer

   After establishing a call between two IPv4-only UAs, one of the
   parties in the call may attempt to transfer the other party to a 3rd
   party using the REFER method [RFC5589].  This transfer may be to an
   IPv6-only UAS.  The implication is that both IPv4-only UASs involved
   in the call transfer need to be able to handle a REFER with an IPv6
   address in the Refer-To header.  The transferor needs to be able to
   form the proper REFER message with the IPv6 Contact and the

Internet-Draft      IPv4/IPv6 Interoperability in SIP          July 2013


   transferee needs to be able to process the REFER message and attempt
   to establish a call with the transfer target.

3.8.  DNS Resolution of IPv4/IPv6 in SRV Records

   A dual-stack UA may use the Domain Name System (DNS) SRV mechanism to
   resolve addresses of proxies that it needs to communicate with.  In
   such a case it needs to be able to locate both IPv4 proxies and IPv6
   proxies.  This implies that the DNS server has been updated with both
   A and AAAA records for the SIP server, and that the dual-stack UA
   requests for both IPv4 and IPv6 SIP server addresses.

3.9.  IPv6 Address Handling in Multiple Contact Registrations

   A 200 OK to a REGISTER request might include multiple Contact headers
   because the user has registered his or her Address of Record (AOR) on
   multiple clients.  Some of these Contact headers might have IPv6
   addresses.  An IPv4-only UAC must be able to handle the IPv6
   information properly.

3.10.  Unsupported Address

   If the endpoint is an IPv4-only client and it receives a request with
   an SDP offer that has IPv6 address(es) only, the IPv4-only client
   should decline the request by returning 488 "Not Acceptable Here" (as
   defined in section 13.3.1.2 of RFC3261) with Warning header that has
   warning code of 301 "Incompatible Network Address Formats" (as
   defined in section 20.43 of RFC3261).  If the ipv4-only client
   receives a request with an SDP offer that has a mixed set of IPv4 and
   IPv6 addresses, then the IPv4-only client should accept the IPv4
   address(es) and decline the IPv6 address(es) by setting the port
   number in the m-line to zero.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document merely describes the potential impacts of IPv6 on IPv4
   SIP implementations.  The scenarios discussed in this informational
   document do not introduce any new security threats.  The specific
   security vulnerabilities, attacks, threat models of the various
   protocols discussed in this document (SIP, SDP, ICE, etc.) are well
   documented in their respective documents.

A.1.  IPv6 Implementation Guidelines

   This section lists basic IPv6 recommendations for SIP
   implementations:

   To avoid parsing errors, IPv6 address MUST be delimited by "[" and "
   ]" in the following cases:

   * If an IPv6 address is included in a SIP Request URI
   * If an IPv6 address is included in a SIP "Via" header
   * If an IPv6 address is included in a SIP "Contact" header

   No delimiters are needed for other SIP tags such as "received" or
   even at the SDP level.

   The SIP ABNF for IPv6 reference defined in [RFC3261] MUST NOT be
   used.  Instead, rules defined in [RFC3986] MUST be supported.

   To compare SIP URIs, [RFC5954] MUST be used instead of [RFC3261].

   [RFC5952] MUST be supported for IPv6 textual representation purposes.

   An IPv6-enabled SIP MUST NOT include any loopback address (::1) or
   link local address (fe80) in SIP headers and SDP body.

A.2.  IPv6/IPv4 Interworking Function: Avoid IPv6 address Leakage?

   The introduction of IPv6-enabled SIP UAs may lead to some failure
   issues of the legacy (IPv4-only) UA are unable to parse IPv6
   addresses.  To prevent those failure cases, an IPv6/IPv4 Interworking
   Function may be deployed in the SIP infrastructure to adapt SIP
   messages.  In particular, this interworking function may be
   configured to avoid leaking any IPv6 address to a legacy IPv4-only
   SIP UA (and vice versa).  An IPv6-only SIP UA will be seen by a
   remote IPv4-only SIP UA as any legacy IPv4-only SIP UA.  Leaking IPv6
   addresses in headers is a concern only for headers used for session
   routing purposes (e.g., topmost via, contact, etc.).

   Within managed SIP networks, the impact of leaking addresses of
   distinct address family should be assessed through testing campaigns.
   If no failures are experienced, enabling the function which prevents
   leaking addresses of distinct address family may be avoided.

Internet-Draft      IPv4/IPv6 Interoperability in SIP          July 2013


   In order to promote the use of IPv6 transfer capabilities and avoid
   extensive usage of IPv4/IPv6 interworking resources, leaking IPv6
   addresses in a backward compatible manner should be encouraged.  For
   instance, the SDP offer can include both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
   (e.g., [RFC6947]).  The address family to be used to place the
   session will be decided by the remote peer.

   When both IPv4 and IPv6 SIP UA are deployed in a network, the SIP
   Proxy Server will need a trigger to decide whether invoking IPv4/IPv6
   Interworking function is required; otherwise IPv4/IPv6 IWF resources
   won't be optimized.  A potential solution for this problem is
   discussed in [I-D.boucadair-dispatch- ipv6-atypes].  Relying on the
   address of contact is not deterministic since a dual-stack SIP UA may
   be registered with its IPv4 address while it supports also IPv6.
