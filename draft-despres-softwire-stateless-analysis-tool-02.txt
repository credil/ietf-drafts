   Feature Analysis Tool for stateless IPv4/IPv6 (MAP-T, MAP-E, 4rd)
           draft-despres-softwire-stateless-analysis-tool-02

Abstract

   This document proposes a discussion tool for the Softwire meeting at
   IETF 84 in Vancouver.

   Significant differentiating features between the MAP approach
   (proposed standards MAP-T and MAP-E) and the unified approach
   (proposed standard 4rd) are presented in tabular format.

   Its purpose is to facilitate decision making, and is therefore
   temporary.

Internet-Draft           Stateless Analysis Tool               July 2012


1.  Introduction

   Stateless solutions that are proposed for residual IPv4 service
   across IPv6-only networks will be discussed at IETF 84 in Vancouver,
   July 27 to August 3 2012.  This document proposes a tool to
   facilitate common understanding during these discussions, and thus
   facilitate decision making on what to standardize and why.

   It contains tables in which, for each of the major proposed
   specifications, MAP-T, MAP-E and 4rd, the most significant
   differentiating features are listed:

   o  Table 1 deals with features that depend on whether IPv4 packets
      are twice translated (MAP-T), tunneled with packet encapsulation
      (MAP-E), or tunneled with reversible IPv4/IPv6 header translation
      (4rd).

   o  Table 2 deals with features that depend on how IPv6 addresses are
      derived from IPv4 addresses, plus ports if applicable.  Table 3
      deals with miscellaneous features.

   Documents used are:

   o  [I-D.ietf-softwire-map] for MAP-T and MAP-E

   o  [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] for 4rd

   Issues identified on the tracker of trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/softwire/
   trac/report/1 are referenced by their ticket numbers.
