1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivations

   In the PAWS protocol, the master device queries the database for
   available spectrum, but the device MUST determine the URL for the
   database before it can send any PAWS messages.  Brief discussions of
   database discovery can be found in [RFC6953] and [PAWS PROTOCOL].

   Several different choices can be taken for the device to determine
   the appropriate URL(s) for connection.  There are some possible
   methods for this purpose (not all methods are included here): (1) The
   manufacture or the user of device can manually pre-configure
   statically the URL(s) of one or more databases that is available for
   the device to query white space spectrum (e.g. the device and
   database have agreements with each other.), for example, if the
   device is to be used in US, it will be configured with the database
   of US, and then it directly connects to the database in US, or if the
   device is to be used in several countries it can be configured with
   different database for each country. (2) The device can be configured
   by certain provisioning process after attaching to operator's
   network. (3) An entity of Listing server[PAWS PROTOCOL], providing
   the URLs for one or more Spectrum Databases, could be deployed in a
   regulatory domain, then the device queries and checks available
   databases from the Listing server. (4) When the database which the
   device currently connects to cannot provide service for this device
   any more, it can redirects this device to anther database that can
   serve the master [PAWS PROTOCOL].

   But in some scenarios the methods above may not work well: (1) To
   pre-configure device, the user has to know the available database(s)
   that can be used in the regulatory domain, it may be inconvenient
   especially when the device is moved to a different regulatory domain.
   (2) It is possible that some databases are not available any more or
   some new databases are setup, the pre-configuring and provisioning
   method may not cope with it very well. (3) It is possible that in
   pre-configuring method the available databases of several regulatory
   domains may be pre-configured in device, and whether it is convenient
   for a device to know which regulatory domain it currently locates at
   the beginning. (4) In the method that database provides redirecting
   to the master device some security related issues have to be
   considered.  It might be ok for a database to provide master device
   with URL of another database in the same regulatory domain.  But in
   case when master moves from regulatory domain A to regulatory domain
   B, it might not all seems right for database of A to provide
   regulatory domain information and available databases or Listing
   server of B to the device, because PAWS databases and master devices
   are each certified to operate in certain regulatory domains.

   So a dynamic database discovery mechanism is provided here, the
   mechanism can be used independently or cooperate with other methods,
   e.g. device can first connect to the configured or provisioned
   databases, if that fails then the device can use the dynamic
   mechanism to find out available databases.

   The discovery mechanism discussed here will provide master device
   with two kind of information: the regulatory domain where the device
   locates now and the available list of DBs or a Listing server in that
   domain.

   The mechanism discussed in this memo will be provided as an OPTIONAL
   method as described in PAWS PROTOCOL [PAWS PROTOCOL].

1.2.  Mechanism overview

   The dynamic database discovery mechanism provided here is used by a
   device to discover the available white space databases for its
   current location and related regulatory domain information.

   In discovery procedure, the URI for the database SHOULD be obtained
   from an authorized and authenticated entity.  The master device
   provides its current geo-location information to the entity in
   Database Discovery Request message, and the entity will return a list
   of available databases/or Listing server and the regulatory body
   related information that has jurisdiction over the master device's
   location.

   When the master device gets the information about available database
   and regulatory body, it can choose the proper database for querying
   white space spectrum by PAWS procedures.


2.  Terminology and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

   The terminology from PAWS: problem statement, use cases and
   requirements RFC6953 [RFC6953] is applicable to this document.

   White Space Database (WSDB)

   In the context of white space and cognitive radio technologies, the
   database is an entity which contains, but is not limited to, current
   information as required by the regulatory policies about available
   spectrum at any given location and time, and other types of related

   (to the white space spectrum) or relevant information.

   White Space Database Discovery Server (WSDB DS)

   A server function provided to a white space device, the client.  The
   white space device contacts a white space database discovery server
   to receive the service of discovering or identifying one or more
   white space databases.  The white space database discovery server is
   a known entity to the white space device, which knows at least a
   useable internet address for the white space database discovery
   server.  The white space database discovery server takes as input
   positioning information from the white space device and returns both
   URLs of white space databases that cover white space device's current
   location and indication of the regulatory domain governing at the
   white space device's current location.  A single white space database
   discovery server may have global scope, serving clients located
   globally.

   Mapping

   Mapping is a process that takes a location and a service identifier
   as inputs and returns one or more URLs.  Those URLs can point either
   to a host providing that service or to a host that in turn routes the
   request to the final destination.

   Device

   The device in this memo is equivalent to the master device described
   in RFC6953 [RFC6953].


3.  System Architecture Description

   Before the WSD can query a trusted WSDB for a list of available
   frequencies or channels for use in the white space spectrum, the WSD
   must first discover the available databases and addresses serving the
   regulatory domain in which the device is currently located.  At
   power-up the WSD does not reliably know the regulatory domain
   corresponding to its current location, and therefore does not
   reliably know with which white space database(s) it can communicate.
   Furthermore it is essential that the WSD connect with a trusted WSDB
   for proper operation and indeed regulatory compliance.

   The discovery system is based on client-server model; the basic model
   is shown in Figure 1.

                    Figure 1: DB discovery system model

   The WSDB DS takes as input location information from the WSD and
   returns to the WSD one or more addresses of WSDBs or WSDB Listing
   servers as appropriate to the WSD.

   For the discovery mechanism to work well, some assumptions have to be
   considered:

   (1) Master device can get its geo-location directly or indirectly.

   (2) Master device has gotten the URL (or IP address) of a trusted
   WSDB DS before starting the discovery procedure.

   The URL or IP address of WSDB DS can be found by any method such as
   DNS, manually configuring etc, and it is out of scope of this
   document.

   The WSDB DSs can be deployed independently without knowledge of each
   other; a lot of WSDB DS can be deployed all around the world.

   When the WSD does not have the address of a serviceable WSDB (e.g. at
   power-up or failed to get the current regulatory domain etc), the WSD
   sends a Discovery Request message to a WSDB DS.  The WSD includes in
   the Discovery Request information about its current location.  The
   WSDB DS uses this location information to determine the regulatory
   domain where the WSD is located, and returns a Discovery Response
   message which includes the address of one or more WSDBs (or WSDB
   listing server as appropriate) and regulatory domain related
   information to the WSD.

   An overview of procedures of how master device gets available
   spectrum from WSDB is depicted in Figure 2.

   (0) Discovery trigger.  There are several conditions that could
   trigger the database discovery procedure, for example, after master
   device's power-up, or when master device moves into a new regulatory
   domain, or when master device fails to connect to all of the pre-
   configured databases etc.

   (1) Discovery Request procedure.  This message is used by master
   device to query available WSDB from WSDB DS; it conveys master's
   location and some other related information to WSDB DS.

   (2) Discovery Response procedure.  This procedure conveys the
   regulatory domain and either the address of a listing server or the
   address of one or more WSDB authorized to provide service where the
   WSD is physically located to the master device.  If spectrum access
   is not authorized at the WSD physical location, the response will
   contain an error code and no address information.

   (3) After WSDB discovery procedure, the master device can query
   available white space spectrum from the WSDB using PAWS protocol.

   After master device has selected a available database for service, it
   can then use the PAWS protocol [PAWS PROTOCOL] to retrieve the
   available spectrum for its location.


4.  Specification

   In this document, a dynamic database discovery mechanism based on
   existing LoST protocol [RFC5222] is discussed.

4.1.  Brief introduction of LoST

   LoST (Location-to-Service Translation Protocol) is an XML-based
   protocol for mapping service identifiers and geodetic or civic
   location information to service contact URIs and associated
   information.

            Figure 4: n overview of procedures in LoST protocol

   The LoST client sends its location information and service type it
   wants to LoST server to retrieve one or more service URIs.

   The LoST server maintains the mapping relationship between location
   and service URI, on receiving request message it maps the location
   and service identifier in the request to one or more service URLs
   that can offer the service in the location.

   LoST messages are carried in HTTP and HTTPS protocol exchanges,
   facilitating use of TLS for protecting the integrity and
   confidentiality of requests and responses.

   This discovery mechanism utilizes LoST to communicate between master
   device and WSDB DS, the master device acts as LoST client and WSDB DS
   plays the role of LoST server.  The protocol stack is shown in Figure
   5.  To use LoST for this discovery mechanism, several issues have to
   be clarified.

4.2.  Issues to be clarified

4.2.1.  Service Identifier

   A new service identifier for PAWS database discovery needs to be
   defined, according to RFC5031 [RFC5031], a top-level service and a
   sub-service are defined here.

         +----------------+-------------------------------------+
         |     Service    |             Description             |
         +----------------+-------------------------------------+
         |      paws      |      top-level service of PAWS      |
         | paws.discovery | the PAWS database discovery service |
         +----------------+-------------------------------------+

                                  Table 1

   So according to the service-identifying labels defined above, the
   service URN for PAWS database discovery service is as follow:

   urn:service:paws.discovery

4.2.2.  Conveying of regulatory domain

   The name of regulatory domain can be conveyed using <displayName>
   element in the LoST response message.

   [Note: the format and content of the regulatory domain information
   are TBD.]

4.2.3.  URL-related information

   The WSDB DS may return database or Listing server to master device,
   but because the database and Listing server are all in the form of
   URL, so it may be difficult for mater device to distinguish between

   database URL and Listing server URL.  Here an extension to LoST is
   needed: for every <URI> element that used for conveying URL a new
   attribute ("indicator") which indicates whether it is a URL of
   database or a URL of Listing server.

   When the URL is for a database, then master device can run PAWS
   protocol to query white space spectrum from the database; or when the
   URL is for a Listing server, then master device connects to the
   Listing server for available database(s) in the domain.

4.3.  Discovery procedures

4.3.1.  Discovery Request procedure

   The discovery request procedure uses the <findService> query message
   of LoST for conveying parameters.  Master device's location
   information will be included in the <location> element.

   The service identifier defined in Section 4.2.1 is specified in the
   <service> element.

   The following is an example of discovery request procedure message,
   using geodetic coordinates.


   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <findService
        xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:lost1"
        xmlns:p2="http://www.opengis.net/gml"
        serviceBoundary="value"
   recursive="true">
        <location id="6020688f1ce1896d" profile="geodetic-2d">
          <p2:Point id="point1" srsName="urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326">
             <p2:pos>37.775 -122.422</p2:pos>
          </p2:Point>
        </location>
        <service>urn:service:paws.discovery</service>
      </findService>


4.3.2.  Discovery Response procedure

   The discovery response procedure uses the <findServiceResponse>
   response message of LoST for conveying parameters.

   After receiving the <findService> query message, the WSDB DS will map
   the location information and service identifier to one or more
   available WSDBs' URL.

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                   Oct 2013


   Then in the <findServiceResponse> message, a list of WSDBs' URL and
   regulatory domain that has jurisdiction over the current location
   will be conveyed to master device.  The regulatory domain is
   contained in <displayName> element.

   The service boundary of the WSDB can also be included in the response
   message to indicate the region for which the service URL returned
   would be the same as in the actual query.  Or a service boundary
   reference can be returned to master device, and master device
   retrieve service boundary by this reference as needed.  Next time
   when the master device powers up, if its location is within the
   service boundary it then may use the WSDB retrieved before.

   An example of discovery response procedure message is shown as
   follow:

4.3.3.  Recursion and Iteration

   If the WSDB DS can not provide available WSDB for master device, then
   it may wish other WSDB DS to serve the master device's query request.
   In LoST, recursion and iteration patterns are provided for this
   purpose.

   In recursive mode, the LoST server initiates queries on behalf of the
   requester and returns the result to the requester.

   In iterative mode, the server contacted returns a redirection
   response indicating the next server to be queried if the server
