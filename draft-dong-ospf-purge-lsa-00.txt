Abstract

   In some scenarios current OSPF flushing mechanism may incur problem
   of delaying the deletion of invalid Link State Advertisement (LSA)
   and result in desynchronization of link state database.  This
   document proposes a backward compatible solution to solve this
   problem.

Internet-Draft               OSPF Purge LSA                 October 2011


1.  Introduction

   The LSA flushing mechanism of OSPF is described in [RFC2328].  In
   some scenarios such as route oscillation, this flushing mechanism may
   incur problem of delaying the deletion of invalid LSA on some
   routers, and result in desynchronization of link state database.

   This document proposes a backward compatible solution to solve this
   problem.


2.  Problem with OSPF Flushing Mechanism

   As described in section 14.1 of [RFC2328], an LSA can be flushed from
   the routing domain by setting its LS age to MaxAge, while leaving its
   LS sequence number alone, and then reflooding the LSA.  The MaxAge
   LSA must be removed immediately from the router's link state database
   as soon as both a) it is no longer contained on any neighbor Link
   state retransmission lists and b) none of the router's neighbors are
   in states Exchange or Loading.  And section 12.1.6 of [RFC2328]
   specifies that "As soon as this flood has been acknowledged by all
   adjacent neighbors, a new instance can be originated with sequence
   number of InitialSequenceNumber."  Thus after the MaxAge LSA is
   removed, a new instance with sequence number equal to
   InitialSequenceNumber would be originated.

   Under some scenarios such as route oscillation, such procedure may
   delay the deletion of invalid LSA in the link state database of some
   routers thus cause desynchronization of link state database.  One
   example is described as below:

   a.  Router X and router Y formed OSPF adjacency, X advertised an AS-
   external-LSA with sequence number set to InitialSequenceNumber to Y.
   Then route oscillation happens to this external route.

   b.  X flushes the AS-external-LSA by setting the LS age to MaxAge and
   sends it to Y. After some time X does not receive the acknowledgment
   from Y, then X retransmits the flushing LSA to Y.

   c.  Y receives the first flushing LSA and sends Acknowledgment back
   to X. Then Y receives the second flushing LSA and sends back the
   second acknowledgment.

   d.  X receives the first Acknowledgment and remove the flushing LSA
   from its link state database.  Then X originates this AS-external-LSA
   with InitialSequenceNumber and sends it to Y. Soon the LSA is flushed
   again due to route oscillation.  After doing this, X receives the
   second acknowledgment for the previous flushing from Y, then the

   flushing LSA is removed from X's link state database.

   e.  Y receives this new LSA and install it into its link state
   database.  Then in a short time Y receives the flushing LSA.  If the
   time interval between this flushing LSA and previous LSA is shorter
   than MinLSArrival, this flushing LSA would be discarded by Y.

   As a result, router X does not have this LSA in its link state
   database, but router Y will keep this LSA until the LS age reaches
   MaxAge.  Such desynchronization of link state database may cause
   traffic blackholing or forwarding loops.

   The root cause of this problem is that after LSA flushing the router
   would set the LS sequence number of the new LSA instance back to
   InitialSequenceNumber.  And in some cases the LSA updates and the
   acknowledgments may become out of sync.


3.  Proposed Flushing Mechanism

   This section defines a flushing mechanism to solve the problem
   described in section 2.  This flushing mechanism SHOULD be used when
   LS sequence number is not to wrap.  When it is time for the LS
   sequence number is to wrap, procedures in Section 14.1 of [RFC2328]
   MUST be used.

   When an LSA needs to be flushed, the router SHOULD keep only the
   header of the LSA, set its LS age to 0 and increment the LS sequence
   number by 1.  Such an LSA is called Purge LSA.  The router SHOULD
   flood this Purge LSA to neighbors for LSA flushing.  The Purge LSA
   SHOULD be retained in the database until the LS age reaches MaxAge.

   When a new instance of the LSA is to be originated, if a
   corresponding Purge LSA exists in the database, the router SHOULD
   advance the LSA's LS sequence number one past the LS sequence number
   of the corresponding Purge LSA.  Then the corresponding Purge LSA
   SHOULD be removed from the router's link state database.


4.  Backward Compatibility

   The proposed flushing mechanism is backward compatible with legacy
   OSPF implementations.  Legacy OSPF routers would treat the received
   Purge LSA as a newer instance than its database copy, since the
   sequence number is larger.  And since the Purge LSA contains only LSA
   header, it will not be used in the routing table calculation.  When
   the LS age of this purge LSA reaches MaxAge, it would be removed from
   the router's link state database.
