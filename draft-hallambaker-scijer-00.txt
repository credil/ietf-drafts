Abstract

   SCIJER (pronounced skyjer) specifies a mapping of data types to
   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) encoding.  The JSON specification
   defines encodings for integers, strings, arrays and objects.  This
   document specifies a mapping between JSON encoding and an extended
   set of types.

1.  Definitions

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Defined Terms

   The following terms are used in this document:




2.  Introduction

   JSON is a format for encoding data structures in UTF8 text format
   with similar capabilities to XML and ASN.1 but with lower coding
   overhead.  Unlike XML and ASN.1, JSON does not have a schema
   language.

   This draft defines a mapping between JSON data types and programming
   language types that MAY be used as the basis for a schema language
   definition.


3.  Bindings

   Specify conversions between JSON encoding and C, C# and Java types.

3.1.  Object

   JSON

   C

   C#

   Java

3.2.  Serializable

3.2.1.  Array

   JSON

3.2.2.  List

   JSON

   C

3.3.  Boolean

   JSON  true | false

   C  int

   C# bool

   C# boolean

3.4.  Integer

   JSON  number without decimal point

   C, C#, Java  int or long

3.5.  Floating Point

   JSON  number with decimal point

   C, C#, Java  float or double

3.6.  String

   The String type maps to the JSON string encoding.  The following
   subtypes are defined to represent commonly used syntactic
   restrictions.

   JSON  String encoding

   C  char * [NB must use appropriate wrappers to encode/decode UTF8]

   C#, Java  String

      URI

      Label

      Name

3.6.1.  URI

   A URI is a string that contains a URI as specified in [RFC3986].

3.6.2.  Label

   A label is a string that MUST NOT contain any ASCII character other
   than digits (0-9), alphabetic (a-z, A-Z), underscore or dash.  All
   other UNICODE characters are permitted.

   The Label type provide a means of avoiding content injection attacks
   by ensuring that a field does not contain characters commonly used as
   control characters in scripting languages.

3.6.3.  Name

   A Name is a sequence of Labels separated by period characters '.'.

   Note that the syntactic restriction of a Name is not exactly the same
   as the restriction on a DNS address.

3.7.  Enumeration

   An enumeration is encoded as a Label.

3.8.  Time

   SSCIJER supports two encodings

   DateTime  A string encoded in [RFC3339] format.  This provides a
      human readable representation.

   ElapsedTime  A number that represents the number of seconds that have
      elapsed since January 1, 0001 at 00:00:00.000 in the Gregorian
      calendar.  Decimals MAY be used to represent time intervals of
      less than a second.

   Conversion between the two encodings MUST be informed by the times at
   which leap seconds were introduced into the UTC coding.  This creates
   a challenge in the case that a device only has access to time in one
   form but not the other.

   In order to address this problem, implementations MUST accept time
   values encoded in either format and SHOULD emit the encoding
   specified in the schema.

3.8.1.  DateTime

   JSON  String [Encoded in [RFC3339] format.]

   C  System dependent

   C# DateTime

   Java  Date

   Represents a date and time in the Gregorian callendar using the
   format described in [RFC3339].

3.8.2.  ElapsedTime

   JSON  Number

   C  System dependent

   C# DateTime

   Java  Date

   A number that represents the number of seconds that have elapsed
   since January 1, 0001 at 00:00:00.000 in the Gregorian calendar.
   Decimals MAY be used to represent time intervals of less than a
   second.

3.9.  Binary

   JSON  String [Base64 encoding of binary data]

   C  {unsigned char *, length}

   C#, Java  byte []

3.10.
