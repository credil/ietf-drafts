 Make-Before-Break MPLS-TE LSP restoration and reoptimization procedure
                           using Stateful PCE
                  draft-tanaka-pce-stateful-pce-mbb-02

Abstract

   Stateful PCE (Path Computation Element) and its corresponding
   protocol extensions provide a mechanism that enables PCE to do
   stateful control of MPLS Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE
   LSP).  Stateful PCE supports manipulating the existing LSP's state
   and attributes (e.g., bandwidth and route) and also creating totally
   new LSPs in the network.

   In the current MPLS TE network using RSVP-TE, LSPs are often
   controlled by "make-before-break (M-B-B)" signaling by headend for
   the purpose of LSP restoration and reoptimization.  In most cases, it
   is an essential operation to reroute LSP traffic without any data
   disruption.

   This document specifies the procedure of applying stateful PCE's
   control to make-before-break RSVP-TE signaling.  In this document,
   two types of restoration/reoptimization procedures are defined,
   implicit mode and explicit mode.  This document also specifies the
   usage and handling of stateful PCEP (PCE Communication Protocol)
   messages, expected behavior of PCC as RSVP-TE headend and several
   extensions of additional PCEP objects.

Internet-Draft     M-B-B procedure using Stateful PCE           Oct 2013


1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] describes the stateful Path Computation
   Elements(PCE).  Stateful PCE defines the extensions to PCEP to enable
   stateful control of LSPs between and across PCEP sessions, and it
   also describes mechanisms to effect LSP state synchronization between
   PCCs and PCEs, and PCE control of timing and sequence of path
   computations within and across PCEP sessions.

   Today, however, there is no detailed procedure specified as to how to
   restore and reoptimize one particular MPLS-TE LSP using stateful PCE.
   In today's MPLS RSVP-TE mechanism, make-before-break (M-B-B) is a
   widely common scheme supported by headend LER in order to assure no
   traffic disruption during restoration and reoptimization.  Hence it
   is naturally desirable for stateful PCE to control M-B-B based
   signaling and forwarding process.

   This document specifies the definite procedures of applying stateful
   PCE's control to M-B-B method.  In this document, two types of
   restoration/reoptimization procedures are defined, Implicit mode and
   explicit mode.  This document also specifies the usage and handling
   of stateful PCEP (PCE Communication Protocol) messages, expected
   behavior of PCC as RSVP-TE headend and several extensions of
   additional objects.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119[RFC2119].


3.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC5440]: PCC,
   PCE, PCEP Peer.

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC3209]: make-
   before-break, Path State Block.

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC4426] and
   [RFC4427]: recovery, protection, restoration.

   According to their definition the term "recovery" is generically used
   to denote both protection and restoration; the specific terms
   "protection" and "restoration" are used only when differentiation is
   required.  The subtle distinction between protection and restoration

Internet-Draft     M-B-B procedure using Stateful PCE           Oct 2013


   is made based on the resource allocation done during the recovery
   period.  Hence the protection allocates LSP resource in advance of a
   failure, while the restoration allocates LSP resource after a failure
   occur.


4.  Motivation

   As for current MPLS mechanism, make-before-break(M-B-B) concept is
   outlined in [RFC3209], which allows adaptive and smooth RSVP-TE LSP
   rerouting that does not disrupt traffic or adversely impact network
   operations while rerouting is in progress.  M-B-B is applicable for
   reoptimizing LSP's route and resources for several use cases, for
   example, to adopt better path for reversion after failure, to change
   traversing node/links for planned maintenance, to change bandwidth of
   LSPs.  M-B-B is also used for global restoration scenario in case of
   failure, which is effective if operators do not want to reserve both
   working and standby LSPs' bandwidth in advance.  Once failure occur,
   LSP becomes down, however PSB (Path State Block) of a headend node
   remains and keep resources.  Using M-B-B, the headend node is able to
   resignals working LSP while the PSB remains until new restoration LSP
   is successfully established.  In real deployment, it can also be
   operated with local protection scheme FRR (Fast ReRoute).

   Since M-B-B operational scheme is universally common in MPLS network
   today, it is naturally much desirable to utilize it under the
   architecture of stateful PCE.

   The basic procedure of the Make-Before-Break method is outlined as
   follows:

      1.  Establish a new LSP
      2.  Transfer data traffic from old LSP onto the new LSP
      3.  Tear down the old LSP (Release old PSB)

   In M-B-B, it is an important behavior that headend node handles the
   sequence of data traffic switchover.  The headend is able to "make"
   one or more new LSPs for a particular Tunnel (i.e., it is allowed to
   signal multiple RSVP sessions with different LSP-IDs that share a
   common Tunnel IDs), and the headend will switch the traffic upon only
   one (or some) of those LSPs.  In some use cases about stateful PCE,
   it is expected that operators can watch and control when the data is
   switched over and which LSPs are used.  Therefore, this document
   covers such a procedure and related message extensions.

5.  Make-Before-Break LSP procedures

   There are possibly two modes introduced for Make-Before-Break
   procedure under stateful PCE.  The first one is "implicit M-B-B
   mode", where the operation is triggered by a PC Update Request(PCUpd)
   message from a PCE, and a PCC handles whole Make-Before-Break steps
   (signaling and transferring data traffic) for itself.  This mode
   utilizes the existing messages as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] .

   The second one is "explicit M-B-B mode", where the operation is
   triggered by a PCUpd message with TRIAL LSP TLV, which is defined in
   Section 6.1.  A PCE also controls timing and sequence of the M-B-B
   steps that a PCC takes.  This procedure additionally uses a new
   extended TLV that is defined in
   [I-D.tanaka-pce-stateful-pce-data-ctrl].

   Both types of procedure require at least two LSPs residing in a
   single MPLS-TE tunnel, working LSP and trial LSPs.  An ingress node
   is currently transporting data traffic on the working LSP, and then
   it establishes one or more trial LSPs.  As per [RFC3209] Section 2.5.
   "LSP ID" of a restoration LSP, which is newly signaled, differs from
   that of a working LSP.  Note that it is used for LSP-ID in LSP
   Ideitifiers TLVs in PCEP messages, and it differs from PLSP-ID.  In
   this document, LSP ID of a working LSP describes "old" and that of a
   trial LSP describes "new" as a simple example.

   Implicit mode has high affinity with most existing MPLS edge node
   implementations which perform entire steps of M-B-B automatically at
   once.  This mode is particularly applicable for migration scenario
   for the existing deployment where service providers want their
   recovery/reoptimization operation be delegated to centralized PCE.

   Explicit mode is much more flexible than Implicit mode since it
   allows PCEs to manage each LSP step-by-step.  Explicit mode is
   applicable to several new use cases that require split control of
   signaling and data switchover.  For example, if end-to-end data path
   is created by connecting multiple individual LSPs across different
   segments (e.g., LSP stitching), in reoptimization scenario, data
   flowing cannot be started unless all signaling of all LSPs is
   completed.  Similarly, there is a case under Software Defined
   Networking (SDN) applications, where MPLS domain is connected to
   other non-MPLS domains, and the end-to-end data switchover timing
   should be carefully coordinated with various different methods of
   path/flow setup in each domain.

   PCC and PCE can distinguish which mode, implicit mode or explicit
   mode, is to be performed by checking the type of PCEP messages that

Internet-Draft     M-B-B procedure using Stateful PCE           Oct 2013


   are exchanged.  The implementation MAY support both modes, but for
   each restoration/reoptimization operation, either one of them SHOULD
   be exclusively selected.

5.1.  Implicit Make-Before-Break Mode

   This specifies the detailed procedure of M-B-B LSP restoration and
   reoptimization using exsisting messages which are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] .  This procedure is based on the current
   existing messages/TLVs and no extended TLV is used.  Once a PCC
   receives PCUpd message from a PCE, the PCC automatically executes the
   implicit M-B-B procedure as described in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]
   Section 6.2.

   First, A PCUpd message is sent from a PCE to trigger M-B-B procecure.
   Once a PCC received the PCUpd message, the PCC starts signaling a new
   restoration/reoptimization LSP and it replies back to the PCE a PCRpt
   message with LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV in the LSP Object to notify the
   result of signaling.  If the new LSP failed in setup, the PCC sends
   to the PCE the detail of the result in a PCErr message with the same
   SRP (Stateful PCE Request Parameters) object as that of the PCUpd
   message and it MAY wait for a next instruction from the PCE.

   Second, once a new LSP is successfully established, a PCC transfers
   data traffic from working LSP to new LSP.

   Finally, when a PCC successfully transfered data traffic to the new
   LSP, the PCC tears down the (previous) working LSP by RSVP-TE
   signaling, then the PCC MUST send another PCRpt message.  That PCRpt
   message MUST carry a LSP Object with LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV which
   indicates the value of RSVP-TE signaling the PCC has just torn down.
   As per [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce], the message has to have SRP-ID
   set to 0x00000000.

   Following Figure 1 illustrates the example of implicit M-B-B
   procedure, in following conditions.  Tunnel ID and LSP ID are
   included in an LSP Identifiers TLV in a LSP Object.
   working LSP :  ERO=a-b, Tunnel ID=T1, LSP ID=old
   restoration LSP :  ERO=a-c-b, Tunnel ID=T1, LSP ID=new

5.2.  Explicit Make-Before-Break Mode

   Comparing to the implicit M-B-B mode, explicit M-B-B mode allows a
   PCE to control timing and sequence of subsequent make-before-break
   steps as follows.

   Prior to start of explicit M-B-B mode, the PCE initiates Association
   Group for working LSP by sending a PCUpd message with ASSOCIATION-
   GROUP TLV in the LSP Object that are defined in
   [I-D.tanaka-pce-stateful-pce-data-ctrl].

Internet-Draft     M-B-B procedure using Stateful PCE           Oct 2013


   First step of the explicit M-B-B, the PCE triggers PCC's signaling of
   a new LSP by sending a PCUpd message with TRIAL-LSP TLV that are
   defined in this document.  The PCC sends back to the PCE a PCRpt
   message to notify the result of signaling new LSP.

   Second, the PCE creates a new Association Group for the new LSP by
   sending a PCUpd message with both TRILAL-LSP TLV and ASSOCIATION-
   GROUP TLV in a LSP Object.

   Third, the PCE instructs the PCC to transfer data traffic from old
   LSP to new LSP by sending a PCUpd message with DATA-CONTROL TLV.  The
   PCC automatically tears down the (previous) working LSP once the
   traffic switchover successfully is executed.  Then it sends back to
   the PCE a PCRpt message to notify the result of the switchover.

   The operator may want to separate the third step into traffic
   switchover and tearing down old LSP.  It is further study about the
   separate operation of third step.

   The following subsections specify each Make-Before-Break step in
   detail.

5.2.1.  Initiate Association Group for old LSP

   The very first of step before starting explicit M-B-B is to initiate
   association group for working LSP.  The PCE sends to the PCC a PCUpd
   message that contain both TRIAL-LSP TLV and DATA-CONTROL TLV in a LSP
   object.  RSVP-TE LSP ID that the PCE knows from LSP Identifiers TLVs
   in a PCRpt message MUST be set to LSP-ID of TRIAL-LSP TLV.  The PCE
   assignes ASSOCIATION-GROUP ID in DATA-CONTROL TLV that is unique in
   the PCEP session.

   Figure 2 illustrates an example of working LSP(PLSP-ID P1, Tunnel ID
   T1, LSP-ID old, Association Group ID G1 and ERO Ingress-a-b-Egress).

5.2.2.  Establish new Trial LSP

   As a first step of M-B-B procedure, a PCC establishes a new LSP for
   restoration once PCC receives a PCUpd message with TRIAL-LSP TLV from
   a PCE.  We call this newly established LSPs for restoration "trial
   LSP".  A trial LSP is signaled the same RSVP-TE Tunnel ID but
   different LSP ID from active working LSP, and both the active working
   LSP and new trial LSPs MUST be signaled with Shared Explicit style as
   describes in [RFC3209].

   TRIAL-LSP TLV triggers explicit mode M-B-B.  A PCE do not have to
   assign RSVP-TE LSP ID for trial LSP signaling, LSP-ID in the TRIAL-
   LSP TLV SHOULD be set to 0x0000.  The PCC assigns new LSP-ID to
   signal new LSP on the same RSVP-TE tunnel.

   When a new trial LSP was signaled successfully, the PCC sends a PCRpt
   message toward the PCE to notify the result.  The PCRpt message from
   the PCC MUST have the LSP object with LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV that
   indicates RSVP-TE Tunnel ID and LSP ID the PCC has just established.

   If a new trial LSP failed to be established by some reason of RSVP-TE
   signaling, the PCC MUST send to the PCE a PCRpt message carrying LSP-
   IDENTIFIERS TLV and RSVP-ERROR-SPEC TLV as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] Section 7.3.4..

   A PCC SHOULD accept multiple PCUpd messages with TRIAL-LSP TLV in a
   LSP Object.  And a PCC SHOULD establish as many trial lsps as the
   number of PCUpd messages it receives.

                        Figure 3: Establish new LSP

5.2.3.  Create a New Association Group

   As a second step, the PCE creates a new Association Group for the new
   LSP by sending a PCUpd message with both TRILAL-LSP TLV and
   ASSOCIATION-GROUP TLV in a LSP Object.  The PCE assignes a new
   ASSOCIATION-GROUP-ID, which MUST be different from that of working
   LSP and be unique in the PCEP session.  LSP-ID in the TRIAL-LSP TLV
   MUST be the RSVP-TE LSP ID of the newly established LSP on the
   previous step.

   If the PCUpd message has invalid either ASSOCIATION-GROUP-ID or
   LSP-ID of TRIAL-LSP, the PCC sends a PCErr message with Error-type=19
   (Invalid Operation) and Error-vale=TBD (Specified LSP-ID/
   ASSOCIATION-GROUP-ID is not existing).

   Figure 4 illustrates an example to create a new ASSOCIATION-GROUP-ID
   G2 for a new trial LSP(PLSP-ID P1, Tunnel ID T1, LSP-ID new and ERO
   Ingress-a-b-Egress).

5.2.4.  Switchover Data Traffic triggered by a PCUpd message

   As a third step, the PCC(Ingress) transfers data traffic from a
   working LSP to a trial LSP.  To specify desired LSP for transferring
   data traffic, a PCUpd message from a PCE MUST have a DATA-CONTROL TLV
   in a LSP Object.

   Data switchover from old (origin) ASSOCIATION-GROUP to new (target)
   has to be executed in the same manner as described in
   [I-D.tanaka-pce-stateful-pce-data-ctrl].

   The PCC SHOULD tear down the old working LSP and other trial LSPs
   which the data traffic is no longer used immediately once the data
   traffic succesfully switched over (See Figure 5).  In OPTIONAL, a PCC
   tears down old lsp separately.  The PCC sends to the PCE a PCRpt
   message to notify the removal of both old LSP and other trial LSPs,
   which SRP-ID is set to 0x00000000.

                      Figure 6: TRIAL-LSP TLV format

   TRIAL-LSP TLV is sub-TLV of the LSP Object and is used in a PCUpd
   message especially to perform explicit mode M-B-B.  A PCC signals a
   trial LSP once it receives a PCUpd in which LSP object has a TRIAL-
   LSP TLV(LSP-ID=0x0000).

   LSP-ID:   This field MUST be zero in a PCUpd message when a PCE
      requests a PCC to signal new trial LSP.  It MUST be non-zero and
      fill in the RSVP-TE LSP ID when a PCE sends a PCUpd message to
      initiate or to create Association Groups for a working/trial LSP.

8.  Operational Considerations

8.1.  Operation in multiple PCEs

   In addition to basic operations under multiple PCEs as described in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce], a PCC supports both types of M-B-B
   operations.

   Implicit mode M-B-B requires only one PCUpd message to trigger M-B-B
   process, therefore a PCC accepts a message from a primary PCE whom
   the PCC delegates the LSPs to.  An attempt to update parameters of a
   non-delegated LSP results in the PCC sending a PCErr message as
   defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].

   Explicit mode M-B-B requires at least three PCUpd messages(1. for
   trial-LSP signaling, 2. for new Association-Group creation, 3. for
   traffic switchover) to trigger each subsequent step.  All steps MUST
   be taken by one primary PCE because state synchronization of trial-
   LSPs between the primary and backup PCE may be complex.  If the PCC
   revokes LSP delegations after a Redelegation Timeout Interval, the
   PCC MUST tear down all trial-LSPs and redelegate a working LSP to
   alternate PCE.  An attempt to trigger either step of explicit mode
   M-B-B of a non-delegeted LSP results in the PCC sending the same
   PCErr as implicit mode M-B-B.


9.  Security Considerations

   TBD
