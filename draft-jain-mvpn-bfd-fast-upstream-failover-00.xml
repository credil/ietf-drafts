      <t>This document defines BGP extensions and procedures that allows use
      of BFD for Multi Point Networks for fast detection and failover for
      upstream faults in Multicast VPNs. The upstream failures addressed in
      this proposal can be failure of any node between the Root PE and Leaf PE
      or failure between the Multicast Source and Root PE.</t>

    <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 <xref

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In case of multicast in BGP/MPLS VPNs deployment, for purpose of
      redundancy the multicast source could be dual-homed to the Root PE(s).
      The dual-homed Root PE(s) could individually originate P-Tunnel towards
      the Leaf PE. This mechanism is described in <xref
      target="I-D.draft-morin-l3vpn-mvpn-fast-failover" />. The Leaf PE can
      source the traffic from either of the upstream dual-homed Root PE node.
      In such a deployment, there could be two types of failure
      scenarios:-</t>

      <list style="numbers">
        <t>Failure of any network element in the provider network between Root
        PE and Leaf PE.</t>

        <t>Failure of any network element between the Multicast Source and the
        Root PEs.</t>
      </list>

      <t>It is desirable to achieve fast failure detection and switchover for
      any failure from above scenarios.</t>

      <t>This document addresses both the above failure scenarios by using BFD
      for Multipoint Networks <xref target="I-D.katz-ward-bfd-multipoint" />
      and defining new BGP extensions for advertising the BFD parameters which
      will be used for fast failure detection of scenarios mentioned
      above.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>Terminology used in this document:</t>

      <t>Root PE: PE closest to the Multicast Source (This could be either
      directly connected to Multicast Source or via some network). P-Tunnel
      would be originating at this node. This P-Tunnel could be Inclusive or
	  Selective.</t>

      <t>Leaf PE: PE Node closest to the Multicast Receiver (This could be
      either directly connected to Multicast Source or via some network).
      P-Tunnel would be terminating at this node.</t>

      <t>BFD : Bidirectional Forwarding Detection.</t>

      <t>Other terminologies are as defined in <xref target="RFC6513" /> and
      <xref target="RFC6514" />.</t>

      <t>As seen in the above diagram, all the PEs would be part of same
      multicast VPN. Multiple multicast sources (S1..Sn) could be dual-homed
      to two PEs (PE1 and PE2), referenced as Root PEs. Both the Root PEs
      would originate P-tunnel, which would terminate at Leaf PE (PE3).</t>

      <t>As long as C-S is reachable via both Root PEs, the Leaf PE will
      select one of the PEs connected to C-S as its Upstream PE with respect
      to C-S, this PE would be referred as "Primary Upstream PE". We will
      refer to the other PE connected to C-S as the "Standby Upstream PE".
      Note that if the connectivity to C-S through the Primary Upstream PE
      becomes unavailable, then the PE will select the Standby Upstream PE as
      its Upstream PE with respect to C-S. This procedure is described in
      <xref target="I-D.draft-morin-l3vpn-mvpn-fast-failover" />.</t>

      <t>If it is desired to use BFD to monitor the status of the P-Tunnel,
      then there is a need to exchange the BFD discriminator between the Root
      PE node and Leaf PE.</t>

      <t>If it is desired to use BFD to monitor the status of individual
      Multicast Source and P-Tunnel pair, then there is also a need to exchange the
      BFD discriminator between the Root PE node and Leaf PE to track the
      Multicast-Source and P-Tunnel pair status.</t>

      <t>This document defines new BGP extensions for advertising the BFD parameters 
	  to bring up BFD for Multipoint Networks session <xref target="I-D.katz-ward-bfd-multipoint"/>
	  which would be used to track and addresses both the above failure scenarios.
      </t>

    <section title="BGP-BFD Attribute">
      <t>This document defines and uses a new BGP attribute called the
      "BGP-BFD attribute". This is an optional transitive BGP attribute. The format of
      this attribute is defined as follows:</t>

      <figure>
        <artwork>

        |       Flags (1 octet)         |

        |  BFD Discriminator (2 octets) |

      <t>The Flags field has the following format:</t>

      </figure>

      <t>BFD Discriminator: This is the local discriminator for this BFD
      session, and is used to uniquely identify it. It MUST be unique across
      all BFD sessions on this system, and nonzero. It SHOULD be set to a
      random (but still unique) value to improve security. The value is
      otherwise outside the scope of this specification.</t>

        <section title="Root PE Procedures">

          Root PE MUST include the BGP-BFD Attribute in the I-PMSI A-D Route
          specified in <xref target="RFC6514" /> Section 4.1.</t>

          <t>If a P-Tunnel is already signaled, and then it is desired to
