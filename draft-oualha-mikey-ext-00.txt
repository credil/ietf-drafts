Abstract

   The Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) protocol is a key management
   standard defined in RFC 3830 for streaming and real-time
   applications. In these applications, the MIKEY protocol may be used
   to provide group key management. With the base protocol, the change
   of one group member triggers the unicast transmission of a new group
   key to all members. In the context of an application delivering
   multicast streams to end-users located at multiple capillary
   networks, the key update messages may scale in proportion to the
   number of nodes; thus creating a substantial overhead. This I-D
   proposes an extension to the MIKEY protocol allowing the management
   of the group as a set of clusters, but with fewer changes to the RFC
   3830 standard. Clustering helps in reducing the communication
   overhead produced during key update by using unicast mode only with
   nodes that belong to clusters where group membership changes

Internet-Draft     Extending MIKEY for use in LLNs           June 2013

1. Introduction

   The Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) protocol [RFC3830] is a key
   management standard that has been designed to be easily integrated
   with the existing security protocols. The extensions proposed for
   this protocol (like [RFC4650], [RFC4738], [RFC5197], [RFC6043], and
   [RFC6267]) focus mainly on providing different encryption modes and
   algorithms to be used by the protocol. Other efforts have recently
   been undertaken (e.g., [I-D.ietf-roll-mikey-lln-key-mgmt]) to
   lighten the protocol in order to extend the applicability of the
   protocol to resource constrained-device networks. To further adapt
   MIKEY to these networks, we propose a group-clustering-based
   approach that uses unicast mode only within a cluster of nodes of
   the group whenever group key update is needed. The approach requires
   few changes to the base MIKEY protocol.

     1.1. Terminology and definitions

   The following gives the definitions and abbreviations that are
   mostly a remainder from [RFC3830].

1.1.1. Definitions

   (Data) Security Protocol: the security protocol used to protect the
   actual data traffic.  Examples of security protocols are IPsec and
   SRTP.

   Data Security Association (Data SA): information for the security
   protocol, including a TEK and a set of parameters/policies.

   Crypto Session (CS): uni- or bi-directional data stream(s),
   protected by a single instance of a security protocol.

   Crypto Session Bundle (CSB): collection of one or more Crypto
   Sessions, which can have common TGKs and security parameters.

   Crypto Session ID: unique identifier for the CS within a CSB.

   Crypto Session Bundle ID (CSB ID): unique identifier for the CSB.

   TEK Generation Key (TGK): a bit-string agreed upon by two or more
   parties, associated with CSB. From the TGK, Traffic-encrypting Keys
   can then be generated without needing further communication.

   Traffic-Encrypting Key (TEK): the key used by the security protocol
   to protect the CS (this key may be used directly by the security
   protocol or may be used to derive further keys depending on the
   security protocol).  The TEKs are derived from the CSB's TGK.

   Key Index: The Key Index (KI) is used as identifier to allow
   referencing the key(s) that are associated with a given CS. Each TGK
   is associated with a KI as defined in [I-D.ietf-roll-mikey-lln-key-
   mgmt].

   TGK re-keying: the process of re-negotiating/updating the TGK (and
   consequently future TEK(s)).

   Initiator: the initiator of the key management protocol, not
   necessarily the initiator of the communication.

   Responder: the responder in the key management protocol.

1.1.2. Abbreviations

   CSB    Crypto Session Bundle

   SIP    Session Initiation Protocol
   SRTP   Secure RTP

   TGK    TEK Generation Key

1.1.3. Rationale

   The approach proposed in this I-D is intended for networks that are
   composed of resource constrained devices. Examples of such networks
   are wireless sensor networks or multiple of these networks receiving
   the same streaming content. Devices in these networks are generally
   large in number, but they can be divided into multiple clusters
   where they are highly correlated to each other (e.g., by type or by
   location). The dynamics of devices (e.g., device join/leave to the
   group, failure) could be different in these clusters.

   The proposed approach aims at MIKEY objective to establish a
   security association and keys for a security protocol like SRTP. It
   extends the base MIKEY protocol by considering the group divided
   into multiple clusters based on group members' dynamics. The group
   clustering reduces the communication overhead caused by group key
   updating due to members' dynamics, which contributed in unloading
   the constrained-network nodes.

1.1.4. Outline

   Section 2. describes the context for which the approach is proposed.
   The section gives also an overview of the architecture that is
   considered and illustrates the main contribution of the approach
   using a demonstrative example.

   Section Erreur ! Source du renvoi introuvable.details the practical
   extensions and added elements to the base MIKEY protocol [RFC3830].

2. Clustering-based approach overview

   This section gives an overview of the proposed approach. It first
   defines the context in which the approach can be applied. It then
   details the description of the approach pinpointing the changes
   proposed to the base MIKEY protocol.

     2.1. Context

   The proposed approach uses the architecture of [RFC3740] composed of
   the group controller/key server (GCKS) and a group of
   sender/receiver nodes. The GCKS authenticates nodes. If nodes are
   authorized to receive or send the stream, they will be provided from
   the GCKS with the required keying materials.

   The approach assumes that the group of receiver nodes is divided
   into a number of clusters. The management of clusters is handed out
   to the GCKS. Since the GKCS is responsible of the issuance and
   management of cryptographic keys and also user-authentication and
   authorization checks, we can assume that this entity is responsible
   of affecting nodes to clusters based on their location, their
   mobility pattern, etc. For example, clusters may be mapped to the
   physical network topology: each cluster may correspond to a
   different capillary network. The assignment of nodes to clusters is
   out of the scope of this I-D.

     2.2. Description

   The idea behind the proposed approach is summarized with the
   following:

   o The GCKS launches multiple instances of the MIKEY protocol. Each
      MIKEY protocol instance corresponds to a different cluster of
      receiver nodes (seen Figure 1).

   o Each cluster receives a set of TGKs. Subsets of these TGKs are
      shared with some other clusters. Additionally, each TGK is
      identified by the same KI along the different clusters. The GCKS
      ensures this dependency between the different protocol instances.

Internet-Draft     Extending MIKEY for use in LLNs           June 2013

   o Key management is handled independently for each MIKEY instance;
      though the GCKS ensures that at all times, all clusters share at
      least one TGK that is used to establish common security
      associations for the underlying security protocol e.g., SRTP.

   o Whenever a node leaves or joins the group, the GCKS dynamically
      update the group key TGK, by synchronizing key update operation
      for each of the MIKEY protocol instances. The usual unicast key
      update is used for the cluster concerned with the membership
      change. On the other hand, the remaining clusters will update
      their security association based on the KI associated with the
      new shared TGK.

   Figure 1 The clustering-based approach

2.2.1. Demonstrative example

   Demonstrative example: We consider a group composed of two clusters
   C1 and C2 of identical size. The nodes in both clusters share a
   group key TGK1 and TGK2. Additionally, nodes in the cluster C1
   (respectively C2) share an additional group key TGK3 (respectively
   TGK4) with the GCKS.

   At first, we assume TGK1 needs to be updated (e.g., because it has
   been compromised). In this case, nodes will be simply notified of
   the new group key, TGK2 that is shared by all nodes in the group,
   using the corresponding KI in the underlying security protocol.

   Later, we assume that a node from C2 leaves the group. This event
   triggers TGK key update. For the remaining members of C2, TGK3 is

Internet-Draft     Extending MIKEY for use in LLNs           June 2013

   distributed based on the base MIKEY unicast mode. On the other hand,
   members of C1 will be notified of TGK update by simply using KI to
   identify the new group key TGK3 through the underlying security
   protocol. With this proposed approach, the communication overhead
   due to group key update is divided by 2, compared to the basic MIKEY
   protocol, thanks to the use of multiple instances of MIKEY.

3. Extension elements to MIKEY

   The proposed approach was thought in a way where changes to the base
   MIKEY protocol are limited. Since management of MIKEY instances is
   handled by the GCKS, the main transformation is carried out at this
   entity. No extra signaling is needed in the network. At the receiver
   node side, no transformation occurs, apart from the consideration of
   a KI to notify nodes of the update of the TGK key.

   The GCKS is in charge of launching MIKEY protocol instances for each
   of the different clusters. The GCKS must guarantee that these
   instances are synchronized and that they share the same group key
   TGK at all times. Each receiver node within the same cluster will
   share other TGK keys shared with nodes from some other clusters.

   The base MIKEY protocol does not provide TGK rekeying in the GKMARCH
   sense [RFC4046]. The MIKEY protocol is re-executed again and keys
   are updated using unicast messages. With the approach proposed in
   this I-D, TGK update uses the same procedure as the base MIKEY
   protocol for nodes in the cluster where membership changes occur.
   Otherwise, a notification of the change of the group key is
   performed at the underlying security protocol using the key index
   associated with the new group key.

   The decision of TGK update procedure is carried out by the GCKS that
   ensures synchronization between the different instances of MIKEY for
   the same group communication.

4. Security Considerations

   Since the proposed approach relies on multiple instances of the base
   MIKEY protocol, it does not perform significant changes to the base
   protocol, and rather focuses on the group architecture without
   impacting the security of the protocol.

5. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to record the pre-defined values defined in
   [RFC3830]. The name spaces for the new field Key index identified in
   [I-D.ietf-roll-mikey-lln-key-mgmt] are requested to be managed by
   IANA.
