        Structured Access Token for Sharing Authorization Grant

Abstract

   This specification defines a format of structured access tokens that
   are issued by the authorization server and received by the resource
   server in the OpenID Connect protocol. By using this format, the
   authorization server and the resource server can be easily separated
   and the validation of the access token can be performed offline.

INTERNET DRAFT      Structured Access Token in OIDC        February 2013


1.  Introduction

   The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework ([RFC6749]) defines a method
   for third-party client authorization using access tokens. In OAuth,
   an authorization server issues an access token to a client, and the
   client requests resources from a resource server sending the access
   token. The OpenID Connect protocol ([OIDF.Connect.Standard]) is based
   on the OAuth framework; an OpenID provider as an authorization server
   issues an access token to a relying party as a client, and the
   relying party obtains claims about an entity from a resource server
   in exchange for the access token.

   In OAuth, an authorization server and a resource server need neither
   be the same server nor be closely-coupled. That is, a resource server
   may has to validate access tokens without information that is
   implicitly passed from authorization servers. The OAuth 2.0
   ([RFC6749]) framework does not define methods for resource servers to
   validate access tokens and resource servers validate access tokens in
   implementation-defined behaviors.

   This specification defines a format of structured access tokens that
   are issued by the authorization server and received by the resource
   server in the OpenID Connect protocol ([OIDF.Connect.Standard]). By
   using this format, the authorization server and the resource server
   can be easily separated and the validation of the access token can be
   performed offline.

   The format of structured access tokens specified in this document is
   based on the JSON Web Token (JWT) format ([I-D.ietf-oauth-json-web-
   token]).

   [[Note: this document should be harmonized with the jwt-bearer
   draft.]]

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Structured Access Token Format

   A structured access token will be a JWT ([I-D.ietf-oauth-json-web-
   token]) that contains claims defined in the following sections and
   other claims. The JWT MUST be signed unless otherwise the
   authenticity of the JWT is assured. The JWT MAY be encrypted by the
   issuer.

2.1.  "iss" (Issuer) Claim

   The "iss" (issuer) claim contains the identifier of the authorization
   server that issues the access token. Use of this claim is REQUIRED.

2.2.  "sub" (Subject) Claim

   The "sub" (subject) claim contains the identifier of the entity whose
   claims are provided in exchange for the access token. The value of
   this claims needs to be shared between the authorization server and
   the resource server. Use of this claim is REQUIRED.

2.3.  "aud" (Audience) Claim

   The "aud" (audience) claim contains the identifier of the resource
   server that receives the access token and returns claims. Use of this
   claim is REQUIRED.

2.4.  "exp" (Expiration Time) Claim

   The "exp" (expiration time) claim contains the expiration time on or
   after which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted. The value is an integer of
   seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. Use of this claim is REQUIRED.

2.5.  "nbf" (Not Before) Claim

   The "nbf" (not before) claim contains the time before which the JWT
   MUST NOT be acceppted. The value is an integer of seconds from 1970-
   01-01T00:00:00Z. Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.

2.6.  "iat" (Issued At) Claim

   The "iat" (issued at) claim contains the time at which the JWT was
   issued. The value is an integer of seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
   Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.

2.7.  "claims" Claim

   The "claims" claim contains the required claims about the entity
   identified by the "sub" claim. The value is an array of strings. Use

   of this claim is OPTIONAL.

2.8.  "issued_for" Claim

   The "issued_for" claim contains the identifier of the party which is
   intended to use the access token and to request resources. Use of
   this claim is OPTIONAL.

3.  Structured Access Token Usage

   Structured access tokens can be used for accessing protected
   resources like end-users' claims. The resource server and the
   authorization server need to share entities' identifiers beforehand
   in order to validate access tokens and provide resources by the "sub"
   claim.

   When a resource server received a structured access token, the
   resource server is RECOMMENDED to validate the token in the following
   criteria. Note that the validation criteria MAY vary by the contents
   of tokens.

   o The "aud" claim MUST be the identifier of the resource server or
     the value that the resource server can accept as the audience of
     the token.
   o The value of the "exp" claim MUST be more than the current time.
   o If the "nbf" claim exists, the value MUST be less than or equal to
     the current time.
   o If the "iat" claim exists, the value can be used to reject tokens
     that are issued at an unacceptable time (e.g., future or too far
     past). The acceptable range is determined by the resource server.
   o The token MUST be a valid JWT and signed by the authorization
     server identified by the "iss" claim.
   o The "iss" claim MUST be an identifier of an acceptable
     authorization server. The acceptable values MAY vary by the "sub"
     claim or other claims.
   o The "sub" claim MUST be a valid identifier of an entity. The value
     will be authorization-server specific, so the resource server needs
     to evaluate the "sub" claim together with the "iss" claim.
   o The authorization server specified by the "iss" claim MUST be
     granted to manage authorization by the entity specified by the
     "sub" claim.

   After validating a structured access token, a resource server will
   provide resources specified by the "claims" claim or other claims.

3.1.  UserInfo Request

   When using a structured access token at UserInfo Endpoint, the
   "claims" claim will be used to specify requested claim names. The
   following

   The following is a non-normative example of a JSON object ([RFC4627])
   that could be encoded into a JWT ([I-D.ietf-oauth-json-web-token])
   for a UserInfo request:

      {

        "aud":"https://op.example.com/",
        "iss":"https://op.example.com/",
        "sub":"alice",
        "exp":1360387733,
        "iat":1360386833,
        "nbf":1360385933,
        "claims": [
          "gender",
          "picture"
        ],
        "issued_for":"https://rp.example.com/"
      }

3.2.  Aggregated/Distributed Claims

   When using a structured access token for requesting claims to a
   claims provider in aggregated claims or distributed, the "claims"
   claim will be used alike the UserInfo request. Typically the claims
   provider and the OpenID provider will be separated parties, so they
   need to share the identifier of the entity specified by the "sub"
   claim beforehand. This may be done, for example, by the claims
   provider performing as a relying party to the OpenID provider.

   The following is a non-normative example of a JSON object ([RFC4627])
   that could be encoded into JWT:

      {
        "aud":"https://cp.example.com/",
        "iss":"https://op.example.com/",
        "sub":"82FB7D5C-C6F1-4505-B230-796F31DF683E",
          // PPID from the OpenID provider to the claims provider
        "exp":1360847733,
        "iat":1360846833,
        "nbf":1360845933,
        "claims": [
          "gender",
          "picture"
        ],
        "issued_for":"https://rp.example.com/"
      }
