                Deprecating EUI-64 Based IPv6 Addresses
           draft-gont-6man-deprecate-eui64-based-addresses-00

Abstract

   Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) for IPv6 typically
   results in hosts configuring one or more stable addresses composed of
   a network prefix advertised by a local router, and an Interface
   Identifier that typically embeds a hardware address (e.g., an IEEE
   LAN MAC address).  The security and privacy implications of embedding
   hardware addresses in the Interface Identifier have been known and
   understood for some time now, and some popular IPv6 implementations
   have already deviated from such scheme to mitigate these issues.
   This document deprecates the use of hardware addresses in IPv6
   Interface Identifiers, and recommends the use of an alternative
   scheme ([I-D.ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses]) for the generation
   of IPv6 stable addresses.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC4862] specifies Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) for
   IPv6 [RFC2460], which typically results in hosts configuring one or
   more "stable" addresses composed of a network prefix advertised by a
   local router, and an Interface Identifier (IID) [RFC4291] that
   typically embeds a hardware address (e.g., an IEEE LAN MAC address).

   The security and privacy implications of embedding a hardware address
   in an IPv6 Interface ID have been known for some time now, and are
   discussed in great detail in
   [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy]; they include:

   o  Network activity correlation

   o  Location tracking

   o  Address scanning

   o  Device-specific vulnerability exploitation

Internet-Draft           Generation of IPv6 IIDs            October 2013


   Some popular IPv6 implementations have already deviated from the
   traditional IID generation scheme to mitigate the aforementioned
   security and privacy implications [Microsoft].

   As a result of the afforementioned issues, this document deprecates
   the use of hardware addresses in Interface Identifiers, and
   recommends the implementation of an alternative scheme
   ([I-D.ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses]) that mitigates most of the
   aforementioned issues.

   NOTE: [RFC4291] defines the "Modified EUI-64 format" (which this
   document does not deprecate) for Interface identifiers.  Appendix A
   of [RFC4291] then describes how to transform an IEEE EUI-64
   identifier, or an IEEE 802 48-bit MAC address from which an EUI-64
   identifier is derived, into an interface identifier in the Modified
   EUI-64 format.  Deriving an IPv6 interface identifier based on an
   IEEE EUI-64 identifier is what is deprecated in this document.  Other
   ways of generating an interface identifier in the Modified EUI-64
   format are unaffected.

2.  Terminology

   Stable address:
      An address that does not vary over time within the same network
      (as defined in [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Generation of IPv6 Interface Identifiers

   Nodes MUST NOT employ IPv6 address generation schemes that embed the
   underlying hardware address in the Interface Identifier.  Namely,
   nodes MUST NOT generate Interface Identifiers with the schemes
   specified in [RFC2464], [RFC2467], and [RFC2470].

   Nodes SHOULD implement and employ
   [I-D.ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses] as the default scheme for
   generating stable IPv6 addresses with SLAAC.

4.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA registries within this document.  The RFC-Editor
   can remove this section before publication of this document as an
   RFC.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document deprecates the use of hardware addresses in IPv6
   Interface Identifiers, and recommends an alternative scheme for
   generating IPv6 addresses with SLAAC such that a number of security
   and privacy issues are mitigated.
