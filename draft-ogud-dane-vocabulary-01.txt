          Harmonizing how applications specify DANE-like usage
                     draft-ogud-dane-vocabulary-01

Abstract

   There is no standard terminology as how to talk about use of DNS in
   various application contexts, this document goal is to facilitate
   creation of such a vocabulary/taxonomy.

   This document started out as proposal for specific word usage for
   specifications of adding DANE like technology by different protocols/
   services.  DANE is a method for specifying in DNS records acceptable
   keys/certificates for application servers.

   The terms defined in this document should be applicable to all uses
   of service specification that uses DNS records.

1.  Introduction

   DNS [RFC1034] is being used by many protocols to express where
   services are located on the internet, today there is no good way to
   express exactly what people have in mind when specifying a new
   service/protocol exactly and in concise manner how the service is
   looked up in the DNS.

   DANE [RFC6698] is a powerful new way to provide/amend how
   authentication/authorization/confidencialty of a connection to a
   server can be protected by leveraging DNSSEC [RFC4033] [RFC4034]
   [RFC4035] for the establishment of TLS connection [RFC5246] [RFC6347]
   which in many cases uses PKIX [RFC5280].  All of these technologies
   are complicated.  People familiar with one or two are not necessarily
   familiar with all the parts that needed to apply DANE like mechanism
   to other protocols.

   The goal of this document is three fold:

Internet-Draft DANE common vocabulary: Defintion of Terms   October 2013


   o  To provide common vocabulary for usage of DNS records in service
      specification.

   o  To provide an overview of the non protocol specific parts needed
      to specify an DANE like addition.

   o  To provide a common framework for such specifications making it
      easy to review/compare the specifications.  An important goal is
      to allow the new specifications to avoid repeating explanations
      and/or definitions.

   When below the notation "foo/bar" is used that is because the editor
   is not sure if both apply or which one is more appropriate, please
   advise.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Proposed Terms

   The terms below are being proposed to reduce confusion when reading
   protocol specifications, related to DNS and DANE, for various
   application protocols.

   At this point all the terms below are proposals and better terms are
   welcome.

2.1.  DNS Navigation Records

   DNS Navigation refers to any records used to traverse the DNS tree to
   find the records requested.  This includes

   NS records:  that provide a referral to DNS servers for more specific
         part of the name being looked up.  Example: name server for
         "example." will hand out a referral to server for
         "bar.example." when asked about "foo.bar.example."

   CNAME records:  records that change the location of an record, this
         for all practical purposes a pointer that only applies to that
         specific name.

Internet-Draft DANE common vocabulary: Defintion of Terms   October 2013


   DNAME records:  specify a rewrite rule for a name to a new name.
         Example: "bar.example."  DNAME "foo.example." means that
         "www.bar.example." is to be looked up as "www.foo.example".
         DNAME applies to names that are longer than the name it, i.e.
         "bar.example." is not rewritten but "www.bar.example." is

   DANE specification explicitly requires all of these records to be
   validated by DNSSEC.

   See section Section 2.2

   While traversing the DNS tree other records like A and AAAA are used
   but these records do not change the "navigation", these records do
   not explicitly need to be protected as the data retrieved from the
   addresses is expected to be protected.

2.2.  DNS Integrity

   DNSSEC defines a records and procedures to provide integrity and
   authentication to data stored in DNS [RFC4033].  The records used to
   provide the keying information and chain of trust are DNSKEY, DS
   records.  NSEC/NSEC3 provide information about existence/non-
   existence of the requested information.  RRSIG provides a digital
   signature for a RRset.

   DNSSEC provides both Integrity and Authenticity i.e. it says the
   records came from the right source and have not been changed.

   Any DNS record(s) that is DNS Integrity protected, will pass DNSSEC
   validation for all DNS Navigation records leading to the name and the
   record(s) also pass DNSSEC validation.

   In the case of CNAME and DNAME that go "sideways" i.e. to a different
   branch of the DNS tree, both branches MUST be validated, this
   principle needs to be applied to all such redirection.

2.3.  Service Specification Records

   Protocols have different ways to provide information about where
   servers are located.  Web servers are frequently specified by name
   i.e. the "www" prefix.  Email servers have a special RR type (MX),
   Jabber uses SR records, ENUM uses NAPTR records etc. and there are
   also protocols that use a combination like S-NAPTR a schema where
   NAPTR records are used to specify where to look for SRV records.  For
   all practical purposes NAPTR + SRV should combined be treated as the
   Service Specification.

Internet-Draft DANE common vocabulary: Defintion of Terms   October 2013


   For a DANE like specification it has to be clear as what the service
   specification records are and that these records use requires DNS
   Integrity.

   NOTE: when a client supplies a string to the server as a indicator of
   what service the the client wants, the string supplied MAY depend on
   redirection in DNS navigation as well as results of NAPTR records,
   etc.  See section Section 2.6

2.4.  Service Address Records

   This is where the address records used by the servers reside,
   specifications SHOULD NOT make a difference between what kind of
   address records are used.

   In some cases the Service Specification records reside at the same
   name or are the same as the Service Address records.  Example:
   original TLS/DANE, thus both kinds of records are covered by the same
   DNS integrity rules.

2.5.  Application Authentication Records

   This term refers to the records that provide information about what
   are acceptable keys/certificates for the servers to offer.

   Application Authentication Records MUST be protected by DNS Integrity
   and each protocol specification MUST explicitly state where/how to
   look up the Authentication records.

   In some cases all the servers for a service will have the same
   authentication information, in other cases it is on server by server
   case.  In the first case it is "natural" to store the Authentication
   records "at" the Service Specification records.  In the second case
   it more natural to store them "at" the Address Records.  In this
   context "at" means the authentication records are stored at name that
   is an extension of the location example: "_443._tcp.www.example.com"
   for [RFC6698].  It is possible that neither of these locations is the
   right one and in that case the specification MUST explicitly express
   a rule to find the Authentication Records.

   Note: above that there is no a requirement that the Application
   Address records be covered by DNS Integrity.  This is because when
   the Application Authentication records reside "at" the address
   records, DNS Integrity is inherited.  On the other hand when when
   Application Authentication Records are stored "at" the Service
   Specification Record, DNS Integrity for the address records is
   optional, as any connection to a bogus/wrong server should fail the
   Authentication tests performed at connection time.

Internet-Draft DANE common vocabulary: Defintion of Terms   October 2013


   Note: When a Address record search starts with CNAME or DNAME, where
   should the Authentication Records reside ? With redirection record or
   with final address record ?

2.6.  Offered Names

   When DNAME is used the name queried for is rewritten into a new name.
   To disambiguate these cases following prefix terms are defined.
   Similar rules apply NAPTR + SRV combinations.  It is important for
   many applications to be able to express what name is presented to the
   service at connection time.

   Query:  The name the application issues the query for that RRset.

   Final:  The name after all the indirection records have been applied.

   SRV   The name on the SRV record used.

   NAPTR The name on the first NAPTR record used, prefix with Final if
         that is the one wanted.

   Intermediate  A particular location in the indirection chain.  The
         specification needs to handle this case if it ever occurs.
         NOTE: not sure this is needed???

3.  DANE Example specifcation

   This section is an short example for a protocol that is like SSH
   [RFC4253] we will call this protocol HISS.  This is not an actual
   full specification, just here to give an idea of how to go about
   extending DANE-like to a random protocol using the terminology from
   this document.

   Location of HISS protocol DNS records:

   Service Specification Records:
         HISS uses the address records as the service specification
         record.  This record MUST have "DNS Integrity" as explained in
         RFC-to-be-this-document.

   Service Address Records:
         see: Service Specification Records.

   Application Authentication Records:
         The protocol uses the DNS HISSFP that is stored at the same
         name as the service is specified.  The HISSFP record, if
         present, takes precedence over keys stored in client cache.

   The HISS protocol and HISSFP DNS RR do not exist

4.  IANA considerations

   None

   [RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication ]

5.  Security considerations

   TBD

6.  Internationalizaiton Considerations

   Does this document, in a later version needs to address how to deal
   with special cases resulting from IDN DNAME use?

   When selecting terms to use in standards documents it is important to
   select works that do not confuse international readers.  This
   document goes out of its way in selecting English terms that are
   dissimilar to avoid confusions.
