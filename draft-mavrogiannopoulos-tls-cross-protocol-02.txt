Internet-Draft    Preventing TLS cross-protocol attacks    November 2012


1.  Introduction

   The TLS protocol [RFC5246] suffers from an issue in the
   ServerKeyExchange message signature discovered by Wagner and Schneier
   in [WS-ATTACK].  They describe a cross-protocol attack on the SSL 3.0
   [RFC6101] protocol, that re-uses a signed ServerKeyExchange packet in
   another session with a different key exchange algorithm.  In effect
   the attack uses a server as an oracle to obtain signed
   ServerKeyExchange messages that are relayed to another, unrelated,
   session.  The described attack turned to be impossible to implement
   in practice, but the underlying idea is applicable to all TLS
   protocol versions, and it provides a tool for new attacks on the
   protocol.  The [CROSS-PROTOCOL] attack is a prominent example, which
   takes advantage of interactions between the Diffie-Hellman and
   Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman ciphersuites to perform a TLS server
   impersonation after obtaining 2^40 signed messages.

   In this document we propose a fix for the TLS protocol which makes it
   immune to these attacks, but does not require a protocol version
   upgrade.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the same notation and terminology used in the TLS
   Protocol specification [RFC5246].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  The new ServerKeyExchange signature

   The goal of this memo is to restrict the applicability of the server
   provided signed ServerKeyExchange to the current session.  A simple
   fix may be to include the negotiated ciphersuite into the signature.
   However, the TLS protocol is complex and a key exchange method does
   not always imply a single format of the ServerKeyExchange signature.
   For example, the elliptic curves key exchange method may be used with
   an arbitrary elliptic curve [RFC4492] which requires different data
   in the ServerKeyExchange than when used with a named curve.  Such key
   exchange suboptions are negotiated using TLS extensions and such
   extensions should be covered by the signature, to prevent any attack
   that takes advantage of the different signature format.

   For that we propose that the signature of the ServerKeyExchange
   message to be modified to include in addition to explicit identifiers
   of the algorithms, all the previously exchanged messages.  The
   proposed signature for a ServerKeyExchange message is shown below.

     enum { server (0), client (1) } ConnectionEnd;

     enum { dhe_dss (0), dhe_rsa (1),
            ec_diffie_hellman (2)
          } KeyExchangeAlgorithm;

     struct {
         KeyExchangeAlgorithm kx_algorithm;
         select (KeyExchangeAlgorithm) {
           case dhe_dss:
           case dhe_rsa:
             ServerDHParams params;
           case ec_diffie_hellman:
             ServerECDHParams;
         }
     } Parameters;

     struct {
       Parameters params;
       digitally-signed struct {
         ConnectionEnd entity;
         Parameters params;
         opaque handshake_messages<0..2^24-1>;
       }
     } ServerKeyExchange;

   The new format includes explicit indicators of the entity (server),
   the key exchange algorithm used, the handshake messages exchanged,
   and the parameters of the key exchange.  This modification will be
   negotiated by using a new TLS extension to allow backwards
   compatibility.

4.  The extension

   In order for a client to advertise its support for the new
   ServerKeyExchange format we add a new extension
   "new_server_key_exchange", with value TBD-BY-IANA, to the enumerated
   ExtensionType defined in [RFC5246].  The "extension_data" field of
   this extension is empty.

5.  Server and client behavior

   Clients, that wish to protect against cross-protocol attacks, SHOULD
   include the extension of type "new_server_key_exchange" in the
   (extended) client hello.

   Servers that receive an extended client hello containing a
   "new_server_key_exchange" extension, MAY accept the request for the

   new ServerKeyExchange format by including an extension of type
   "new_server_key_exchange" in the extended server hello.

   Servers compliant to this document, that did not receive the
   extension MUST set the gmt_unix_time part of the Random value
   included in ServerHello to zero.  Because in cross-protocol attacks
   the server's random value is redirected to the client, this is a way
   for the server to indicate support for the extension even in the
   presence of an adversary.

   Clients compliant to this document, that advertised this extension
   but didn't receive a corresponding extension from the server, MUST
   check the gmt_unix_time part of the Random value included in
   ServerHello message for the value zero.  If the gmt_unix_time is zero
   the client MUST abort the handshake with an "illegal_parameter" fatal
   alert.

   Note that this extension is applies to all versions of the TLS
   protocol including TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] and SSL 3.0 [RFC6101].

6.  Security considerations

   This extension modifies the ServerKeyExchange message in order to
   prevent attacks to the protocol similar in nature with the Wagner and
   Schneier attack.  In order for the protection to be applicable, both
   the client and the server must support this extension.

   Compliant servers that did not receive the extension from the client
   are required to set the 4 bytes of the server's random value, that
   encodes the time, as zero.  This provides a tool to indicate support
   for the extended format even in the presence of an adversary, but
   comes at the cost of reducing the total randomness from the server
   from 32 bytes to 28 bytes.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines the TLS extension "new_server_key_exchange"
   (value TBD-BY-IANA) whose value should be assigned from the TLS
   ExtensionType Registry defined in [RFC5246].
