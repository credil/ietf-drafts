    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This specification defines an optional mechanism and the related
      DHCPv6 option to allow DHCPv6 client or first hop DHCPv6 relay agent
      directly connected to the client to populate client hardware address in
      the DHCPv6 messages being sent towards the server.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Problem Background and Scenario">
      <t>DHCPv4 protocol specification <xref target="RFC2131"></xref> provides
      a way to specify the client hardware address in the DHCPv4 message
      header. DHCPv4 message header has 'htype' and 'chaddr' fields to specify
      client hardware address type and hardware address respectively. The
      client hardware address thus learnt can be used by DHCPv4 server and
      relay in different ways. In some of the deployments DHCPv4 servers use
      'chaddr' as a customer identifier and a key for lookup in the client
      lease database.</t>

      <t>With the incremental deployment of IPv6 to existing IPv4 networks,
      effectievly an enablement of dual-stack, there will be devices that act
      as both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 clients. In service provider deployments, a
      typical DHCPv4 implemention will use the client hardware address as one
      of the keys to build DHCP client lease database. In dual stack scenarios
      it is desirable for the operator to associate DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 messages
      as belonging to the same client interface based on an identifier that is
      already used by that operator such as the client hardware address.</t>

      <t>Currently, the DHCPv6 protocol specification <xref
      target="RFC3315"></xref> does not define a way for DHCP clients to
      specify client hardware address in the DHCPv6 message sent towards
      DHCPv6 Server. Similarly DHCPv6 Relay or Server cannot glean client
      hardware address from the contents of DHCPv6 message received. DHCPv6
      protocol specification mandates all clients to prepare and send DUID as
      the client identifier option in all the DHCPv6 message exchange. However
      none of these methods provide a simple way to extract client's hardware
      address.This presents a problem to an operator who is using an existing
      DHCPv4 system with the client hardware address as the customer
      identifier, and desires to correlate DHCPv6 assignments using the same
      identifier. Modifying the system to use DUID based correlation across
      DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 is possible, but it requires a modification of the
      DHCPv4 system and associated back-ends.</t>

      <t>Providing an option in DHCPv6 messages to carry client hardware
      address explicitly will help above mentioned scenarios. For e.g. it can
      be used along with other identifiers to associate DHCPv4 and DHCPv6
      messages from a dual stack client. Further, having client hardware
      address in DHCPv6 will help in proving additional information in event
      debugging and logging related to the client at relay and server.</t>

    <section title="DHCPv6 Client Behavior">
      <t>All hosts or clients MAY include DHCPv6 Client hardware address
      option in all the upstream DHCPv6 messages like SOCILIT, REQUEST, RENEW,
      REBIND, CONFIRM, RELEASE and DELCINE.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="DHCPv6 Relay Agent Behavior">
      <t>DHCPv6 Relay agents which are directly connected to clients/hosts MAY
      look for Client Hardware Address option in the incoming DHCPv6 client
      message. In absence of client hardware option, DHCPv6 Relay agents MAY
      include client hardware address option in relayed DHCPv6 (RELAY-FORW)
      message. The DHCPv6 Relay agent behaviour can depend on configuration
      that decides whether Client Hardware Address option needs to be
      processed and included.</t>

      <t>In Relay chaining scenarios, any other relay agent other than first
      hop DHCPv6 Relay agent or DHCPv6 LDRA <xref target="RFC6221"></xref>
      MUST not add this option.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="DHCPv6 Server Behavior">
      <t>If DHCPv6 Server is configured to store or use client hardware
      address, it MUST first look for the client hardware address option in
      the client DHCP message. In case it is not found, Server SHOULD look for
      client hardware option in the RELAY-FORW message of the DHCPv6 Relay
      agent closest to the client.</t>

      <t>There is no requirement that a server return this option and its data
      in a downstream DHCP message.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA is requested to assign an option code to
      OPTION_CLIENT_HARDWARE_ADDR from the "DHCPv6 and DHCPv6 options"
      registry (http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters/dhcpv6-
