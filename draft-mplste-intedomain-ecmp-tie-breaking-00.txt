              draft-mplste-intedomain-ecmp-tie-breaking-00

Abstract

   This document specifies RSVP-TE extensions that will communicate to
   all the ABRs that they need to explicitly perform a tie-breaking
   process to select a particular path if path calculation results in
   multiple equal-cost paths across different TE-Domains.  This will
   help is efficient utilization of end-to-end network resources for
   Inter-Domain TE LSPs

1.  Introduction

   If multiple equal-cost paths exists for a constraint TE-LSP, then we
   typically use tie-breaking process to select a particular path.  This
   tie-breaking process is executed at the Head-End node where
   Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) computation is exercised.

   In case of RSVP Inter-Domain TE-LSPs of type Contiguous LSP RFC4726
   [RFC4726] and RFC5151 [RFC5151] each ABR is specified as loose hop
   and each ABR along the path whose next hop is specified as a loose
   hop triggers a path computation (also referred to as an ERO
   expansion), before forwarding the RSVP Path message downstream.
   Thus, each ABR is responsible for calculating path within its TE-
   Domain.

   Every node that triggers path computation for its TE-Domain can have
   multiple equal-cost paths and has to chose one of them.  Since there
   are multiple nodes that perform path computation (w.r.t. their
   respective TE-Domains), hence there is no common selection criteria
   for tie-breaking to be followed by each node performing ERO
   expansion.

   This document specifies RSVP-TE extensions that will communicate to
   all the nodes doing ERO expansion that they need to explicitly
   perform common tie-breaking process to select a particular path if
   path calculation results in multiple equal-cost paths across its TE-
   Domain.  By doing this we achieve uniform path selection criteria for
   Inter-Domain TE LSPs.

3.  Establishment and Inability of End-to-End Load Balancing of Inter-
    Domain Contigous TE LSP

   The aim of this section is purely to summarize the mechanisms
   involved in the establishment of a loosely routed TE LSP, based on
   RSVP as specified in RFC3209 [RFC3209], RFC4726 [RFC4726] and RFC5151
   [RFC5151].

   In the context of this document, a loosely routed Inter-Domain TE LSP
   is defined as one that does not contain a full, explicit route
   identifying each LSR along the path of the LSP at the time it is
   signaled by the ingress LSR.  Such an LSP is signaled with an ERO
   that contains at least one loose hop that identifies ABR node.  Each
   LSR along the path whose next hop is specified as a loose hop
   triggers a path computation (also referred to as an ERO expansion),
   before forwarding the RSVP Path message downstream.  The computed
   path may be either partial (up to the next loose hop) or complete
   (set of strict hops up to the TE LSP destination).

   Note that although the examples in the rest of this document are
   provided in the context of MPLS Inter-Domain TE, the proposed
   mechanism applies equally to loosely routed paths within a single
   routing domain and across multiple Autonomous Systems.  The examples
   below are provided with OSPF as the IGP, but the described set of
   mechanisms similarly apply to IS-IS.

   An example of an explicit loosely routed TE LSP signaling follows.

   Assumptions.
          <-area 1-><-area 0-><-area 2->

          R1---R2---R3---R6----R8---R10
          |      / | \   |   / |    |
          |    /   |  \  |  /  |    |
          |  /     |   \ | /   |    |
          R4-------R5---R7----R9---R11


   o  R3, R5, R8, and R9 are ABRs.

   o  The path of an Inter-Domain TE LSP T1 from R1 (head-end LSR) to
      R11 (tail-end LSR) is defined on R1 as the following loosely
      routed path: R1-R3(loose)-R8(loose)-R11(loose).  R3, R8, and R11
      are defined as loose hops.

   o  Step 1: R1 determines that the next hop (R3) is a loose hop (not
      directly connected to R1) and then performs an ERO expansion
      operation to reach the next loose hops R3.  The new ERO could

      become: R2(S)-R3(S)-R8(L)-R11(L) or R4(S)-R3(S)-R8(L)-R11(L),
      where S is a strict hop (L=0) and L is a loose hop (L=1).  Both
      the paths R1-R2-R3 and R1-R4-R3 are equal-cost paths and satisfies
      T1's set of constraints.

   o  Step 2: The RSVP Path message is then forwarded by R1 following
      the path specified in the ERO object and reaches R3 with the
      following content: R8(L)-R11(L).

   o  Step 3: R3 determines that the next hop (R8) is a loose hop (not
      directly connected to R3) and then performs an ERO expansion
      operation to reach the next loose hops R8.  The new ERO could
      become: R6(S)-R8(S)-R11(L) or R7(S)-R8(S)-R11(L).  Both paths R3-
      R6-R8 and R3-R7-R8 are equal-cost paths and satisfies T1's set of
      constraints.

   o  Step 4: The same procedure is repeated by R8 to reach T1's
      destination (R11) and which may also lead to two equal-cost paths
      R8-R10-R11 and R8-R9-R11.

   In the above example we see that there are two equal-cost paths that
   results from path computation done by ingress node (R1) and
   subsequent ABRs (R3 and R8) for their TE-Domain.  In order of
   efficiently using the links as desired by network administrator only
   the ingress node can know about the tie-breaking process to be use as
   part of the TE-LSP configuration, which may lead to efficient use of
   the links in area-1 (or domain 1) only.  However there is no way to
   communicate that subsequent ABRs (R3 and R8) also needs to use common
   tie-breaking process so as to efficiently use the link in their
   subsequent domains.

   This document defines mechanisms that would allow each ABR to know
   what tie-breaking process to use among equal-cost paths when doing
   path computation for their respective TE-domain.

4.  RSVP-TE Extensions

   There are following well known and understood techniques followed by
   various routing vendors used for tie-breaking in case multiple equal-
   cost paths exists.

   o  Least-Fill.

   o  Most-Fill.

   o  Random.

   Most known and deployed implementations employ a consistent
   definition of above three Path Selection tie-breaking schemes, and
   the specifications of each tie-breaking load balancing algorithms is
   outside the scope of this document.  This document only lays down the
   mechanism for signaling what type of tie-breaking process is intended
   to be used for a given Inter-Domain TE LSP.  Such that all the nodes
   along the Inter-Domain TE LSP which does path computations can factor
   such constraints and help in signaling end-to-end TE-LSP which is
   efficiently using links as desired by network administrator spanning
   across multiple TE-Domains.

   In order to indicate nodes (e.g ABRs) that are participating ERO
   expansion for Inter-Domain Contiguous TE LSP to exercise either
   Least-Fill or Most-Fill type of tie-breaking procedure for equal-cost
   paths, this document defines new set of flag values in the Attribute
   Flags TLV, which are carried in LSP_ATTRIBUTES Object RFC5420:.

   o Bit Number (to be assigned by IANA, recommended bit one) : Least-
   Fill Bit.

   o Bit Number (to be assigned by IANA, recommended bit two) : Most-
   Fill Bit.

   Both the bits would together can be referred as ECMP tie-breaking
   bits.  Both the proposed bits would have meaning only in Path
   message.

   If Least-Fill Bit is set, then the node responsible for Path
   expansion MUST use the Least-Fill process for tie-breaking of ECMP
   paths.

   If Most-Fill Bit is set, then the node responsible for Path expansion
   MUST use the Most-Fill process for tie-breaking of ECMP paths.

   If none of the Bit (Least-Fill Bit or Most-Fill Bit) is set, then the
   node responsible for Path expansion can use the default process for

   tie-breaking of ECMP paths.  This could be Random or whatever is
   configured as default tie-breaking process on the node.

   The rules of the processing of the Attribute Flags TLV are not
   changed.

Internet-Draft    Inter-Domain TE-LSP ECMP Tie Breaking       March 2012


5.  Signaling Procedures

   If it is desired to perform uniform way of tie-breaking process (with
   could be Least-Fill, Most-Fill or Random) across all domains for
   Inter-Domain TE-LSP, then head-end node is responsible for setting
   Least-Fill or Most-Fill Bit in the Attribute Flags TLV which is
   carried in LSP_ATTRIBUTES Object.

   When a node receives a Path message which carries an LSP_ATTRIBUTES
   Object with either Least-Fill or Most-Fill Bit set in Attribute Flags
   TLV, then :-.

   If the node is going to perform the ERO expansion (e.g ABR node),
   then it MUST use the appropriate method as what is been signaled
   (Least-Fill or Most-Fill) to perform tie-breaker of ECMP paths.  If
   both Least-Fill and Most-Fill bits are unset, then node can use the
   default process for breaking the tie-breaker of ECMP paths.  This
   could be Random or whatever is configured as default tie-breaking
   process on the node.

   If the node does not need to perform the path expansion (e.g non-ABR
   node), it should do regular Path message processing as defined in
   RFC2205 [RFC2205] and RFC3209 [RFC3209].

   If the node does not support Least-Fill or Most-Fill process of tie-
   breaking of ECMP paths, then it MUST send PathErr to reject the Path
   message with the defined error code ''Policy Control
   Failure''/''Inter- domain policy failure''.

9.1.  IANA Considerations for RSVP-TE

   IANA will assign two Bits in Attribute Flags TLV, which is carried in
   an LSP_ATTRIBUTES Object RFC5420 [RFC5420].  First bit would
   communicate Least-Fill, and the second bit would communicate Most-
   Fill type of tie-breaking procedure for equal-cost paths.

       Following Bit values for Attribute Flags TLV are suggested:-
