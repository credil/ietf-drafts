Abstract

   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) requires the use of
   cryptographic algorithm suites for generating digital signatures over
   DNS data.  There is currently an IANA registry for these algorithms
   that is incomplete in that it lacks the recommended implementation
   status of each algorithm.  This document provides an applicability
   statement on algorithm implementation status for DNSSEC component
   software.  This document lists each algorithm's status based on the
   current reference.  In the case that an algorithm is specified
   without an implementation status, this document assigns one.

Internet-Draft              Algorithm-Status                  April 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) Security Extensions (DNSSEC) [RFC4033],
   [RFC4034], [RFC4035], [RFC4509], [RFC5155], and [RFC5702] uses
   digital signatures over DNS data to provide source authentication and
   integrity protection.  DNSSEC uses an IANA registry to list codes for
   digital signature algorithms (consisting of a cryptographic algorithm
   and one-way hash function).

   The original list of algorithm status is found in [RFC4034].  Other
   DNSSEC RFC's have added new algorithms or changed the status of
   algorithms in the registry.  However, implementers must read through
   all the documents in order to discover which algorithms are
   considered wise to implement, which are not, and which algorithms may
   become widely used in the future.  This document includes the current
   implementation status for certain algorithms.

   This implementation status indication is only to be considered for
   implementation, not deployment or operations.  Operators are free to
   deploy any digital signature algorithm available in implementations
   or algorithms chosen by local security policies.  This status is to
   measure compliance to this document only.

   This document updates the following: [RFC2536], [RFC2539], [RFC3110],
   [RFC4034], [RFC4398], [RFC5155], [RFC5702], and [RFC5933].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The DNS Security Algorithm Implementation Status Lists

2.1.  Algorithm Implementation Status Assignement Rationale

   The status of RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1 is set to RECOMMENDED TO IMPLEMENT
   as major deployments (such as the root zone) use NSEC3 [ROOTDPS].
   The status of RSA/SHA-256 and RSA/SHA-512 are also set to RECOMMENDED
   TO IMPLEMENT as it is believed that these algorithms will replace
   older algorithms (e.g.  RSA/SHA-1) that have a perceived weakness or
   these recommended algorithms are seen in major deployments.

   All other algorithms used in DNSSEC specified without an
   implementation status are currently set to OPTIONAL.

2.2.  DNSSEC Implementation Status Table

   The DNSSEC algorithm implementation status table is listed below.
   Only the algorithms already specified for use with DNSSEC (at the
   time of writing) are listed.


    +------------+------------+-------------------+-------------------+
    |    MUST    |  MUST NOT  |    RECOMMENDED    |      OPTIONAL     |
    |  IMPLEMENT | IMPLEMENT  |   TO IMPLEMENT    |                   |
    +------------+------------+-------------------+-------------------+
    |            |            |                   |                   |
    |   RSASHA1  |   RSAMD5   |   RSASHA256       |   DSASHA1         |
    |            |            |   RSASHA1-NSEC3   |   DH              |
    |            |            |    -SHA1          |   DSA-NSEC3-SHA1  |
    |            |            |   RSASHA512       |   GOST-ECC        |
    |            |            |   ECDSAP256SHA256 |                   |
    |            |            |   ECDSAP384SHA384 |                   |
    +------------+------------+-------------------+-------------------+


   This table does not list the Reserved values in the IANA registry
   table or the values for INDIRECT (252), PRIVATE (253) and PRIVATEOID
   (254).  These values may relate to more than one algorithm and are
   therefore up to the implementer's discretion.  Their implementation
   (or lack thereof) therefore cannot be included when judging
   compliance to this document.

2.3.  Specifying New Algorithms and Updating Status of Existing Entries

   [RFC6014] establishes a parallel procedure for adding a registry
   entry for a new algorithm other than a standards track document.
   Algorithms entered into the registry using that procedure are to be
   considered OPTIONAL for implementation purposes.  Specifications that
   follow this path do not need to obsolete or update this document.

   Adding a newly specified algorithm to the registry with an
   implementation status other than OPTIONAL SHALL entail making this
   document obsolete and replacing the table in Section 2.2 (with the
   new algorithm entry).  Altering the status value of any existing
   algorithm in the registry SHALL entail making this document obsolete
   and replacing the table in Section 2.2 above.

   This document cannot be updated, only made obsolete and replaced by a
   successor document.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document lists the implementation status of cryptographic
   algorithms used with DNSSEC.  These algorithms are maintained in an
   IANA registry.  There are no changes to the registry in this
   document.  However this document asks to be listed as a reference for
   the entire registry.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document lists, and in some cases assigns, the implementation
   status of cryptographic algorithms used with DNSSEC.  It is not meant
   to be a discussion on algorithm superiority.  No new security
   considerations are raised in this document.
