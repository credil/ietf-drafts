1.  Introduction

   Network and services monitoring become more important as we rely more
   on them for our critical operations.  Depending of the complexity of
   our monitor solution we would be able to have more control and
   information from our network and services.  Among other things, a
   good monitor solution allows to::

   o  Detect and avoid network incidents

   o  Determine which actions may solve a network incident

   o  Execute recovery and contingency plans

   All these make sense when we monitor our network responsibly trying
   to cover all the variables.  In the context of this memo, it means
   that we should monitor our services and networks running IPv6 as we
   have/had done in the IPv4 world..

   There are many documents and guides explaining how to deploy IPv6
   networks and services but there are so few that describe in detail
   how to monitor them.  This document tries to encompass a set of
   recommendations and guidelines to help network and system
   administrators to monitor dual-stack/IPv6-only network and services.


2.  Network Monitoring

   In this section we describe SNMP and IPFIX as protocols able to
   manage IP devices and to monitor a variety of data from dual stack
   and IPv6-only networks.  We also discuss traffic analyzers as other
   tools to monitor IP networks.

2.1.  Transport vs. Data

   It is important to understand the difference between IPv6 Transport
   vs. IPv6 data.  In other words, protocols for monitor network
   infrastructure such as SNMP or IPFIX can send IPv6 collected data
   (e.g. the count of forwarded packets of an interface, flow
   information) using either IPv4 or IPv6 transport.

   It is important to note that some node implementations would only
   send data (either IPv4 or IPv6) over IPv4 networks.  Nevertheless
   these are implementation limitations not related to the monitoring
   protocol.

2.2.  Simple Network Management Protocol

   Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) defines the protocol suite
   to monitor and manage IP networks.  SNMP works over UDP that allows
   it to work over IPv4 or IPv6 networks.  However, the definitions that
   allow SNMP to collect data from IP devices know as "Management
   Information Base" (MIB) had to be modified from the original
   specifications.  The most used versions of SNMP are Version 1 and
   Version 2 [RFC1441].  Version 3 is defined in [RFC3411].

   SNMP MIB was defined in [RFC1156] and extended by [RFC1158].  Later
   it was modified by [RFC1213] in 1990 and in 1996 deprecated by RFCs
   [RFC2011], [RFC2012] and [RFC2013] that separated the MIB in IP, TCP
   and UDP.  However all these modifications did not considered IPv6
   yet.  It was until [RFC2465] and [RFC2466] that MIB definitions were
   specified for IPv6 and ICMPv6.  These RFCs described a dissociated
   definition for IPv4 and IPv6.  The last MIB definitions came in 2006
   when [RFC4292] (IP-Forwarding) and [RFC4293] (IP-MIB) defined an
   unified set of managed objects independent of the IP version.

   Today there are many agent and collector implementations that support
   [RFC4292] and [RFC4293].  Nevertheless not all of them support them
   over IPv6 transport and IPv4 has to be used.

2.3.  Flow Analyzers

   Knowing the packet count that goes in and out from an interface it is
   very important but many times is not enough to detect faults or to
   get more detailed traffic information about the network.  Netflow and
   IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) [RFC5101] and [RFC5102] are
   protocols that monitor the IP flows passing through network devices.
   An IP flow is a sequence of packets identified by a common set of
   attributes such as IP Source Address, IP Destination Address, Source
   Port, Destination Port, Layer 3 protocol type, Class of service, etc.

2.3.1.  Netflow

   Netflow is a protocol developed by Cisco Systems and version 9 is
   described in the informational [RFC3594].  Other vendors have adopted
   equivalent technology such as Jflow (Juniper Networks), Cflowd
   (Alcatel-Lucent) and SFlow (sFlow.org consortium).

   Netflow defines nine versions from which version 5 is the most common
   and only versions 9 and 10 support IPv6.  Versions 9 and 10 are
   commonly known as the base of IPFIX.  Although Netflow version 9
   supports the collection of IPv6 flows, not all implementations of
   agents and collectors support IPv6 transport and IPv4 has to be used.

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                August 2013


2.3.2.  Sflow

   Sflow is defined in [RFC3176] and it is very similar to netflow and
   IPFIX.  It differs basically in the method to collect flow
   information.  In the case of Sflow, it uses statistical packet-based
   sampling of switched flows and time-based sampling.  The Sflow
   version described in [RFC3176] supports IPv4 and IPv6 address
   families.

2.3.3.  IPFIX

   IPFIX architecture and message format is defined in RFC5101
   [RFC5101]and RFC5102 [RFC5102] defines its information model.  From
   the operational standpoint of this document IPFIX and Netflow v9 are
   not very different and there is not much more to say besides that
   IPFIX as a relatively new protocol has not been widely implemented.
   For this reason finding an implementation supporting IPv6 transport
   may be hard to find.

2.3.4.  Network/Traffic Analyzers

   Besides SNMP and Flow analyzers IPv6 can be monitored using a variety
   of network/traffic analyzers.  These devices come in a variety of
   flavors and some are open source or free and can be installed in
   commodity hardware, some other are expensive and run on specialized
   equipment.  Commonly they are installed using promiscuous port that
   mirror all the network traffic or they are installed somewhere in the
   network where they can inspect most of the traffic.

   Network/traffic analyzers are a quick way to inspect IPv6 traffic,
   however they may have scalability and privacy issues which make them
   unsuitable for large networks.

2.4.  Command line interface tools

   When SNMP and flow tools are not available in the network device and
   traffic analyzers are not suitable as a long term solution it may be
   possible to use in-house development or other tools to access
   networks devices and parse command line instructions that monitor
   IPv6 traffic.  This solution could be used as well in IPv6 only
   networks when the device implementation does not support IPv6 transit
   to deliver monitoring data.

2.5.  Software Defined Networks

   TBD, In this section we will discuss the use of Software Defined
   Network (SDN) for the purposes of gathering data from the network.

3.  Addressing

   TBD.  In this section we will discuss the implications to use of
   link-local, ULAs and Global Unicast Addresses for the purpose of
   monitor network infrastructure.


4.  Application Monitoring

   Beyond the traffic that goes through the network, network operators
   require to monitor other services such HTTP servers, email
   infrastructure, DNS, sensors, etc.

4.1.  Services

   Besides network information, network operators require to know other
   variables that could affect the good operation of the network.  Dual
   stack networks pose an important challenge to network and system
   administrators.  In principle we are talking about two different
   networks that may have different paths and users may perceive a
   difference in quality.  Furthermore, thanks to Happy Eye Balls
   RFC6555 [RFC6555] that improves the user experience, service
   operators may have no idea to which protocol users are connected.
   This impose the need to monitor two networks and two set of services
   such as HTTP servers, email infrastructure, DNS, etc. to guarantee
   the service expectations from users.

   In order to monitor service uptime and performance, it is common to
   use service probes that frequently poll a specific service to verify
   its reachability.  Most of the time this probes are configured to
   access a service using a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) but
   sometimes literals are used as well.

   To monitor services using FQDNs with A and AAAA records network/
   system administrator must be aware that they do not have a guarantee
   that the probe is using IPv4 or IPv6 transport unless is forced to do
   so.  Some tools provide configuration or execution flags to force the
   use of IPv4 or IPv6 transport.  To guarantee a reliable monitoring
   strategy, we recommend using those flags to set up two monitor
   instances, one for each address family.  Needless to say that in case
   of using literals instead of FQDNs, a new service monitor instance
   using an IPv6 address must be added.

4.2.  FQDN as connection discriminator

   We mentioned that one possible solution to discriminate between IPv4
   and IPv6 services is to use some of the flags provided by the
   monitoring tool to force a connection either in IPv4 or IPv6.

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                August 2013


   Depending of the tool used, this option may not be always available.
   To address this restriction it is possible to use a special FQDN with
   only an A record to force an IPv4 connection and a different FQDN
   with only an AAAA record for IPv6.

   For example suppose that the main organization website has the name
   www.example.com.  The name www.example.com would have A and AAAA
   records as normally, however it would also contain an A record of the
   form www.v4-test.example.com pointing to its IPv4 address and an AAAA
   record www.v6-test.example.com point to the IPv6 address of the
   service.  Other variants may be www.v6.example.com, www-
   v4.example.com, etc.  As these FQDNs are meant to be only internally
   the selection of which to use is left to the network operator.

   Bear in mind that using this alternative may introduce an extra
   overhead related to DNS management and should be used only when
   strictly necessary.


5.  IPv6-Only Networks

   The critical path to monitor IPv6 data on dual-stack networks is the
   device support of the IPv6 only MIBs ([RFC2465], [RFC2466], [RFC2452]
   and [RFC2454]), the unified MIBs ([RFC4293], [RFC4022], [RFC4113] and
   [RFC4292] or flow tools as Netflow 9 or IPFIX.  As long as these
   protocols are supported, the device can be monitor using IPv4 or IPv6
   transport.  However, in IPv6-only networks supporting IPv6 data
   monitoring is not enough.  In order to work it is critical for the
   device or collector to support the delivery or polling data using
   IPv6 transport.

   For SNMP data there are a variety of agents and collectors that
   support IPv6 MIBs (IPv6 and Protocol Independent) using IPv6
   transport.  Nevertheless still exist devices that do not support
   neither IPv6 MIBs nor IPv6 transport of monitoring data.

   With respect of flow tools, the authors of this document are aware of
   only a few implementations that support IPv6 transport.


6.  Operational Challenges

   Even though the end of IPv4 is near, there are still many network
   devices that cannot provide any type of IPv6 monitor data.  In other
   cases the device can provide some sort of data through command line
   interfaces or in the best scenario through out the old IPv6 MIBs and
   using only IPv4 transit for delivery.

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                August 2013


   Still many network devices do not support to collect or send data
   related to IPv6.  Also, some implementations are not widely tested
   and they may not support IPv6 monitoring correctly.  For example,
   there were in the past cases where network devices did not correctly
   reported data collected from interface counters as they only counted
   packets that were process switched.  Eventually this bug was fixed to
   include hardware-processed packets.  It will still possible to find
   more of these types of bugs whilst IPv6 support mature.  For that
   reason we recommend to network operators to always double check the
   IPv6 data retrieved from SNMP agents and interface counters at least
   for a short period of time.  As the IPv6 support moves forward and
   matures, this practice would be less important in the future.


7.  Security Considerations

   From the security stand point, monitoring IPv4, IPv6 or Dual Stack
   networks is no different and the same preventions have to be taken.
   In order to protect SNMP agents, Network Monitoring Systems (NMS),
   flow collectors, network analyzers, etc. operators are advised to use
   a variety of methods such as access list, separate networks for
   management and monitoring, avoid the use of clear text access, etc.


8.  IANA Considerations

   None.
