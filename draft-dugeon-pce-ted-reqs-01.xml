    <abstract>
      <t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) working group (WG) has produced a
      set of RFCs to standardize the behavior of the Path Computation Element
      as a tool to help MPLS-TE and GMPLS LSP tunnels placement. In the PCE
      architecture, a main assumption has been done concerning the information
      that the PCE needs to perform its computation: the Traffic Engineering
      Database (TED) contains all pertinent and suitable information regarding
      the network that is in the scope of a PCE. Nevertheless, the TED
      requirements as well as the TED information have not yet been
      formalized. In addition, some recent RFC (like the Backward Recursive
      Path Computation procedure) or WG draft (like draft-ietf-pce-hierarchy
      ...) suffer from a lack of information in the TED, leading to a non
      optimal result or to some difficulties to deploy them. This memo tries
      to identity some TED requirements for the PCE. It is split in two main
      section: the identification of the specific information to be stored in
      the TED and how it may be populated.</t>
    </abstract>

    <note title="Requirements Language">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

    <section title="Problem Statement">
      <t>Looking to the different RFCs that describe the PCE architecture and
      in particular <xref target="RFC4655">RFC 4655</xref>, <xref
      target="RFC5440">RFC 5440</xref> and <xref target="RFC5441"> RFC
      5441</xref> as well as the draft <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pce-hierarchy-fwk">H-PCE</xref>, the Path Computation
      Element (PCE) needs to acquire a set of information that is usually
      store in the Traffic Engineering Database (TED) in order to perform its
      path computation. Even if intra-domain topology acquisition is well
      documented and known (e.g. by listening to the IGP-TE protocol that runs
      inside the network), inter-domain topology information, PCE peer
      address, neighbor AS ... that are necessary for the Backward Recursive
      Path Computation (BRPC) and the Hierarchical PCE are not documented and
      not completely standardized.</t>

      <t>The purpose of this memo is to inventory the required information
      that should be part of the PCE TED and the different mechanisms that
      allow an operator to populate it.</t>

      <section title="PCE Assumption and Hypothesis">
        <t>In some cases, both the path computation and the TED operations are
        slightly coupled: border node identification, endpoint localization
        and topology aggregation for domain sequence selection... to name a
        few in which an IGP-based TED may not be sufficient. It is also
        important to differentiate several environments with different
        requirements, especially for the multi-domain problem. The PCE is
        scoped for any kind of network, from transport networks (TDM/WDM) with
        a rather limited number of domains, few interconnections, and few
        confidentiality issues; transport networks with a large number of
        domains; MPLS networks with several administrative domains; and big
        IP/MPLS networks with a large number of domains with peering
        agreements. For each of them, a different solution for the
        multi-domain path computation may apply. A solution may not be
        scalable for one, but perfectly suitable for another.</t>

        <t>Up to now, PCE WG has based its work and standard on the assumption
        and hypothesis that the TED contains all pertinent information
        suitable for the PCE to compute an optimal TE-LSP placement, over one
        or several domains a PCE has visibility on or over a set of
        PCE-capable domains (e.g. using BRPC procedure). We could identify two
        major sources of information for the TED:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The intra-domain routing protocol like OSPF-TE or IS-IS-TE
            (including extensions for border links),</t>

            <t>The inter-domain routing protocol, i.e. BGP for the inter-AS
            case.</t>
          </list>If the first source gives a precise and synchronize view of
        the controlled network, BGP typically just provides network
        reachability with only one AS path (unless using recent add path
        option). Nevertheless, to optimize inter-domain path computation,
        route diversity and a minimum set of Traffic Engineering information
        about the foreign domains could be helpful.</t>

        <t>Another source of information, mainly static information can be the
        management plane, e.g. using SNMP, CLI... So, it is necessary to
        classify the source of information by their frequency of update:
        static or dynamic, e.g. a domain ID is unlikely to change, while
        unreserved bandwidth of a link may be continuously changing.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>ABR: Area Border Routers. Routers used to connect two IGP areas
        (areas in OSPF or levels in IS-IS).</t>

        <t>ASBR: Autonomous System Border Router. Router used to connect
        together ASes of the same or different service providers via one or
        more inter-AS links.</t>

        <t>AS: Autonomous System</t>

        <t>Boundary Node (BN): a boundary node is either an ABR in the context
        of inter-area Traffic Engineering or an ASBR in the context of
        inter-AS Traffic Engineering.</t>

        <t>Domain: an Autonomous System</t>

        <t>Entry BN of domain(n): a BN connecting domain(n-1) to domain(n)
        along a determined sequence of domains.</t>

        <t>Exit BN of domain(n): a BN connecting domain(n) to domain(n+1)
        along a determined sequence of domains.</t>

        <t>Inter-area TE LSP: A TE LSP that crosses an IGP area boundary.</t>

        <t>Inter-AS TE LSP: A TE LSP that crosses an AS boundary.</t>

        <t>IGP-TE: Interior Gateway Protocol with Traffic Engineering support.
        Both OSPF-TE and IS-IS-TE are indentified in this category.</t>

        <t>PCE: Path Computation Element. An entity (component, application,
        or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or route
        based on a network graph and applying computational constraints.</t>

        <t>PCE(i) is a PCE with the scope of domain(i).</t>

    <section title="TED Population">
      <t>This section aims to provide best current practices when mechanisms
      are well-known and some hints when standard solutions exist to populate
      the PCE TED, and so give directions to extend them. In particular, we
      aim at providing input on whether the TED gets the information from the
      routing protocol and how it gets it, which specific routing protocols
      are suited, whether it gets it from an NMS, at what frequency the TED is
      updated... and if it needs extra information.</t>

      <section title="Intra-domain">
        <t/>

        <section title="MPLS">
          <t>As the TED mainly contains the intra-domain topology graph, it is
          RECOMMENDED to link the PCE with the underlying IGP-TE (OSPF-TE or
          IS-IS-TE routing protocol). By adding the PCE into the IGP-TE
          routing intra-domain, it is possible to listen to the routing
          protocol and then acquired the complete topology graph as well as
          let the PCE announce itself (see RFC5088 and RFC5089). In addition,
          the TED will synchronize as fast as the routing protocol converges
          like any router in the domain. Best current practices are also of
          interest when a PCE compute path that spawn to several area /
          region. In that case, the PCE must be aware of the topology details
          of each area / region and not only the backbone area / region 1 with
          the summary of stub area / region 2.</t>

          <t>In addition, management tools may be used to complement the
          topology graph provided by the routing protocol.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="GMPLS">
          <t>To be provided later.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Inter-Domain">
        <t>First of all, RFC 5316 or RFC 5392 MUST be activated in the IGP-TE
        (respectively in IS-IS-TE or OSPF-TE) in order to advertise TE
        information on the inter-domain links. This give the advantage for the
        PCE to determine what could be feasible, during path computation, on
        the peering links.</t>

        <t>In MPLS, AS path and network reachability are obtained from BGP and
        routing tables. However, it is not straightforward to collect route
        diversity or TE information (i.e. bandwidth, transit delay, packet
        loss ratio, jitter ...) on a foreign domain. Right now, we have
        identified several methods, which have been tested to fill in the TED
        with this kind of information:<list style="symbols">
            <t>Use of the management plane;</t>

            <t>Use of the <xref
            target="I-D.gredler-idr-ls-distribution">"north bound distribution
            of Link-State and TE Information using BGP"</xref> proposal to
            exchange TE information about the foreign domain;</t>

            <t>Use of PCNtf message to convey, inside vendor attribute (but in
            a non standardized way), TE information of foreign domain between
            PCE</t>
          </list>As well as some potential alternative mechanisms that would
        need more standardization effort:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>A hierarchical TE that could help to advertise, at the AS
            level, TE information on an abstract/aggregate view of the foreign
            AS topology;</t>

            <t>A PCEP extension to convey such TE information to the foreign
            PCE.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Operational information">
        <t>Most of the time operationals information are provided through the
        management system of the operator, but some could be automatically
        discovered. In particular, in intra-domain, PCCs and PCEs can discover
        automatically reachable PCEs (as well as computation domains) through
        the deployment of <xref target="RFC5088">RFC 5088</xref>, for
        OSPF-controlled networks, and <xref target="RFC5089">RFC 5089</xref>
        for IS-IS-controlled networks. However, for the inter-PCE discovery at
        the inter-AS level, no mechanism has been standardized (unless ASes
        are owned by the same ISP).</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Acquisition of information for the PCE TED is of course sensible from
      a security point of view, especially when acquiring information from
      others AS. This section aims at providing best practices to prevent some
      security threat when the PCE try to acquire TED information.</t>

      <section title="Intra-domain information">
        <t>Same security considerations must be applied to the PCE when it is
        connected to an IGP-TE protocol as the routing protocol itself. Best
        practices observed and deployed by operators must also be taken into
        account when installing some PCEs. Indeed, even when deployed as a
        standalone server, PCEs must be considered as a typical router from
        the IGP-TE perspective. As a result, beyond OSPF or IS-IS tehmselves,
        the usual security rules must be applied, e.g. login/passwd,
        authentication/digest... to protect the connectivity.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Inter-domain information">
        <t>Inter-domain relation and so information exchange are subject to
        high potential hijack and so need attention from the security point of
        view. To avoid disclosing or expose confidential information that two
        operators would exchange to fill in the TEDs of their respective PCEs,
        the relation SHOULD be protected by standard cryptography mechanism.
        E.g. using IPsec tunnel is RECOMMENDED to protect the connectivity
        between PCEs and the TED exchanges.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Operational information">
        <t>All operational information like PCE peer addresses are generally
        added manually to the TED and so do not need any particular protection
        nor subject to security. But, as this basic information is needed to
        connected the PCEs to their peers, it could potentially be associated
        to sensitive parameters like login and password. So, standard Best
        Practices are RECOMMENDED to avoid basic security exposition.</t>
