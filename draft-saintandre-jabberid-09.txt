                       The Jabber-ID Header Field
                      draft-saintandre-jabberid-09

Abstract

   email or netnews message to include a Jabber Identifier in the
   message header block for the purpose of associating the author with a
   particular Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) address.

Internet-Draft                  Jabber-ID                 September 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), documented in
   [RFC6120], is a streaming XML technology that enables any two
   entities on a network to exchange well-defined but extensible XML
   elements (called "XML stanzas") in close to real time.  Given XMPP's
   heritage in the Jabber open-source community, one of the primary uses
   for XMPP is instant messaging and presence as documented in
   [RFC6121], and XMPP addresses are still referred to as Jabber IDs.

   Because almost all human users of Jabber/XMPP instant messaging and
   presence systems also use email systems [RFC5322] and because many
   such users also use netnews systems [RFC5536], it can be helpful for
   such users to specify their Jabber IDs in the messages they author.
   The Jabber-ID header field provides a standard location for that
   information.  Members of the XMPP instant messaging and presence
   community have been experimenting with this usage for many years.  As
   a result, this document provides informational documentation
   regarding the syntax and implementation of the Jabber-ID header
   field, including the information necessary to register the Jabber-ID
   field in the Provisional Message Header Field Registry maintained by
   the IANA.


2.  Syntax

   The syntax of the Jabber-ID header field is defined below using
   Augmented Backus-Naur Form [RFC5234], where the "pathxmpp" rule is
   defined in the XMPP URI specification [RFC5122] and the remaining
   rules are defined in the Internet Message Format specification
   [RFC5322]:

      Jabber-ID = SP *WSP pathxmpp *WSP CRLF

   Although a native XMPP address can contain virtually any Unicode
   character [UNICODE], the header of an email or netnews message is
   allowed to contain only printable ASCII characters (see Section 2 of
   [RFC5322]).  Therefore, any characters outside the ASCII range
   [RFC20] in an XMPP address needs to be converted to ASCII before
   inclusion in a Jabber-ID header field, in accordance with the rules
   specified in the XMPP URI specification [RFC5122].  In addition,
   characters allowed in XMPP localparts and XMPP resourceparts but
   disallowed by the relevant URI rules need to be percent-encoded in
   accordance with the rules specified in the URI specification
   [RFC3986].

3.  Implementation Notes

3.1.  Inclusion

   The Jabber-ID header field is associated with the author of the
   message; see [RFC5322].  If the "From:" header field of an email
   message contains more than one mailbox, the Jabber-ID header field
   ought not be added to the message.  There ought to be no more than
   one instance of the Jabber-ID header field.

3.2.  Generation

   For a user whose XMPP address is "juliet@example.com", the
   corresponding Jabber-ID header field would be:

      Jabber-ID: juliet@example.com

   As noted, non-ASCII characters in XMPP addresses need to be converted
   into ASCII before inclusion in a Jabber-ID header field.  Consider
   the following XMPP address:

      ji&#x159;i@&#x10D;echy.example

   In the foregoing example, the string "&#345;" stands for the Unicode
   character LATIN SMALL LETTER R WITH CARON and the string "&#269;"
   stands for the Unicode character LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH CARON,
   following the "XML Notation" used in [RFC3987] to represent
   characters that cannot be rendered in ASCII-only documents.  For
   those who do not read Czech, this example could be Anglicized as
   "george@czech-lands.example".

   Following the rules in [RFC5122] and the Jabber-ID header field
   syntax, the resulting header field might be as shown below (note that
   this representation includes folding white space, which is allowed in
   accordance with the ABNF):

      Jabber-ID:
             ji%C5%99i@%C4%8Dechy.example

3.3.  Processing

   Upon receiving an email or netnews message containing a Jabber-ID
   header field, a user agent that supports the field ought to process
   the field by converting any escaped characters to characters outside
   the ASCII range in accordance with the rules specified in [RFC5122],
   thus yielding a Jabber Idenfitier that can be used for native
   communication on an XMPP network.

3.4.  Disposition

   A user agent that has processed a Jabber-ID header field can provide
   appropriate interface elements if it has independent information
   linking the author of the email or netnews message with the specified
   Jabber Identifier (e.g., via a user-controlled address book or
   automated directory lookup).  Such interface elements might include
   an indicator of "presence" (i.e., that the author is online and
   available for communication via XMPP) if the user is subscribed to
   the presence of the author, and an element that enables the user to
   initiate a text chat with the author.


4.  IANA Considerations

   Header field name:  Jabber-ID
   Applicable protocol:  mail, netnews
   Status:  provisional
   Author/Change contoller  Peter Saint-Andre
      <mailto:stpeter@jabber.org>
   Specification document:  RFC XXXX
   Related information:  See RFC 6120

   Note to IANA and RFC Editor: Please replace "XXXX" with the number of
   the RFC that results from this specification.


5.  Security Considerations

   Message headers are an existing standard and are designed to easily
   accommodate new types.  Although the Jabber-ID header field could be
   forged, this problem is inherent in Internet email and netnews;
   however, because a forged Jabber-ID header field might break
   automated processing, applications ought not depend on the Jabber-ID
   header field to indicate the authenticity of an email or netnews
   message, or the identity of its author or sender.  Including the
   Jabber-ID header field among the signer header fields in DomainKeys
   Identified Mail (DKIM) can help to mitigate against forging of the
   header (see [RFC6376]).

   Advertising XMPP addresses in email or netnews headers might make it
   easier for malicious users to harvest XMPP addresses and therefore to
   send unsolicited bulk communications to the users or applications
   represented by those addresses.  Care ought to be taken in balancing
   the benefits of open information exchange against the potential costs
   of unwanted communication.  An email or netnews user agent that is
   capable of including the Jabber-ID header field in outgoing email or
   netnews messages ought to provide an option for its user to disable

   inclusion of the Jabber-ID header field generally, on a per-recipient
   basis, and on a per-message basis.

   The security considerations discussed in [RFC3986], [RFC3987],
   [RFC5122], [RFC6120], and [RFC6121] also apply to the Jabber-ID
   message header.
