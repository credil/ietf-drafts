Abstract

   This document proposes an alternative 6rd deployment model to that of
   RFC 5969.  The basic 6rd model allows IPv6 hosts to gain access to
   IPv6 networks across an IPv4 access network using 6-in-4 tunnels. 6rd
   requires support by a device (the 6rd-CE) on the customer site, which
   must also be assigned an IPv4 address.  The alternative model
   described in this document initiates the 6-in-4 tunnels from an
   operator-owned gateway collocated with the operator's IPv4 network
   edge, rather than from customer equipment.  The advantages of this
   approach is that it requires no modification to customer equipment
   and avoids assignment of IPv4 addresses to customer equipment.  The
   latter point means less pressure on IPv4 addresses in a high-growth
   environment.

1.  Introduction

   6rd ([RFC5969]) provides a transition tool for connecting IPv6
   devices across an IPv4 network to an IPv6 network, at which point the
   packets can be routed natively.  The network topology is shown in
   Figure 1.

      +--------------+     +-----------------+      +---------+

                     Figure 1: 6rd Deployment Topology

   In Figure 1, the CE is the customer edge router.  It is provisioned
   with a delegated IPv6 prefix, but also with an IPv4 address so that
   it is reachable through the IPv4 network.  If public IPv4 address is
   provisioned to every customer, it will aggravate the pressure due to
   IPv4 address shortage for operators faced with a high rate of growth
   in the number of broadband subscribers to their network.  It is out
   of scope of this document if private IPv4 address is provisioned.


2.  Problem Statement

   Consider an operator facing a high subscriber growth rate.  As a
   result of this growth rate, the operator faces pressure on its stock
   of available public IPv4 addresses.  For this reason, the operator is
   motivated to offer IPv6 access as quickly as possible.

   The backbone network will be the first part of the operator's network
   to support IPv6.  The metro network is not so easily upgraded to
   support IPv6 since many devices need to be modified and there may be
   some impact to existing services.  Thus any means of providing IPv6
   access has to minimize the changes required to devices in the metro
   network.

   In contrast to the situation described for basic 6rd [RFC5569], the
   operator is assumed to be unable to manage IP devices on the customer
   premises.  As a result, the operator cannot assume that any of these
   devices are capable of supporting 6rd.

   If the customer equipment is in bridged mode and IPv6 is deployed to
   sites via a Service Provider's (SP's) IPv4 network, the IPv6-only

   host needs a IPv6 address to visit the IPv6 service.  In this
   scenario, 6to4 or 6RD can be used.  However, each IPv6-only host may
   need one corresponding IPv4 address when using public IPv4 address in
   6to4 or 6rd, which brings great address pressure to the operators.

   If the customer equipment is in routing mode, the operator has an
   opportunity to avoid assigning IPv4 addresses to sites running IPv6
   only.  Some other means is available for routing IPv6 traffic through
   the IPv4 network to that site.  The GateWay in the existing IPv4
   access network should be updated to support IPv6.  But the metro
   network does not need to be updated.

   In 6rd scenario, reachability between CEs in 6RD should go to BR.
   But in this Gateway-initiated 6rd case, it does not need to go to BR
   which only needs gateway to gateway traffic.  How the interaction
   between GW and GW works is for further elaboration.


3.  Proposed Solution

   For basic 6rd, the 6rd-CE described in [RFC5969] initiates the 6-in-4
   tunnel to the Border Router to carry its IPv6 traffic.  To avoid the
   requirement for customer premises equipment to fulfill this role, it
   is necessary to move the tunneling function to a network device.
   This document identifies a functional element termed the 6rd PE to
   perform this task.  The functions of 6rd PE are:

   o  to generate and allocate gateway initiated 6rd delegated prefixes
      for IPv6-capable customer devices, as described in Section 3.1.

   o  to forward outgoing IPv6 packets through a tunnel to a Border
      Relay, which extracts and forwards them to an IPv6 network as for
      6rd;

   o  to extract incoming IPv6 packets tunneled from the 6rd Border
      Relay and forward them to the correct user device.

   In the proposed solution, there is only one tunnel initiated from
   each Gateway to the Border Router, which greatly reduces the number
   of tunnels the Border Router has to handle.  The deployment scenario
   consistent with the problem statement in Section 2 collocates the
   Gateway with the IP edge of the access network.  This is shown in
   Figure 2, and is the typical placement of the Broadband Network
   Gateway (BNG) in a fixed broadband network.  By assumption, the metro
   network beyond the BNG is IPv4.  Transport between the customer site
   and the Gateway is over layer 2.

              Figure 2: Gateway-Initiated 6rd At the IP Edge

   The elements of the proposed solution are these:

   o  The IPv6 prefix assigned to the customer site contains the
      compressed IPv4 address of the network-facing side of the Gateway,
      plus a manually provisioned or Gateway-generated customer site
      identifier.  This is illustrated in Figure 3 below.

   o  The Border Router is able to route incoming IPv6 packets to the
      correct Gateway by extracting the compressed Gateway address from
      the IPv6 destination address of the incoming packet, expanding it
      to a full 32-bit IPv4 address, and setting it as the destination
      address of the encapsulated packet.

   o  The Gateway can route incoming packets to the correct link after
      decapsulation using a mapping from either the full IPv6 prefix or
      the customer site identifier extracted from that prefix to the
      appropriate link.

3.1.  Prefix Delegation

   Referring back to Figure 2, prefix assignment to the customer
   equipment occurs in the normal fashion through the Gateway/IP edge,
   using either DHCPv6 or SLAAC.  Figure 3 illustrates the structure of
   the assigned prefix, and how the components are derived, within the
   context of a complete address.

    Figure 3: Gateway-Initiated 6rd Address Format for a Customer Site

   The common prefix, i.e., the first p bits of the GI 6rd delegated
   prefix, is configured in the Gateway.  This part of the prefix is
   common across multiple customers and multiple Gateways.  Multiple
   common prefix values may be used in a network either for service
   separation or for scalability.

   The Gateway Identifier is equal to the o low-order bits of the
   Gateway IPv4 address on the virtual link to the Border Router.  The
   number of bits o is equal to 32 - IPv4MaskLen, where the latter is
   the length of the IPv4 prefix from which the Gateway IPv4 addresses
   are derived.  The value of IPv4MaskLen is configured in both the
   Gateways and the Border Routers.

   The Customer Site Index is effectively a sequence number assigned to
   an individual customer site served by the Gateway.  The value of the
   index for a given customer site must be unique across the Gateway.
   The length n of the Customer Site Index is provisioned in the
   Gateway, and must be large enough to accommodate the number of
   customer sites that the Gateway is expected to serve.

   To give a numerical example, consider a 6rd domain containing ten
   million IPv6-capable customer devices (a rather high number given
   that 6rd is meant for the early stages of IPv6 deployment).  The
   estimated number of 6rd Gateways needed to serve this domain would be
   in the order of 3,300, each serving 30,000 customer devices.
   Assuming best-case compression for the Gateway addresses, the Gateway
   Identifier field has length o = 12 bits.  If IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling
   is being used, this best case is more likely to be achievable than it
   would be if the IPv4 addresses belonged to the customer devices.
   More controllably, the customer device index has length n = 15 bits.

   Overall, these figures suggest that the length p of the common prefix
   can be 29 bits for a /56 delegated prefix, or 21 bits if /48
   delegated prefixes need to be allocated.

3.2.  Relevant Differences From Basic 6rd

   A number of the points in [RFC5969] apply with the simple
   substitution of the Gateway for the 6rd CE.  When it comes to
   configuration, the definition of IPv4MaskLen changes, and there are
   other differences as indicated in the previous section.  Since
   special configuration of customer equipment is not required, the 6rd
   DHCPv6 option is inapplicable.

   Since the link for the customer site to the network now extends only
   as far as the Gateway, Neighbour Unreachability Detection on the part
   of customer devices is similarly limited in scope.

3.3.  Security Considerations

   No change from [RFC5969].

3.4.  IANA Considerations
