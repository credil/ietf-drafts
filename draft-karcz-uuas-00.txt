1. Introduction

   So far User-Agent strings are long, complicated and often ambiguous.
   (e.g. "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; X11; Linux i686; en) Opera
   8.01" - it is Opera Browser, but it can be read as Internet Explorer
   or Netscape Navigator.) This document specifies a new, easy and clear
   format of Unified User-Agent String (UUAS).

2. Structure

   Unified User-Agent String is separated by space into two parts:

   o Agent signature (REQUIRED) - overview Section 2.1

   o Engine signature (OPTIONAL) - overview Section 2.2

   General ABNF notation of UUAS is:

         uuas = agent *1(SP engine)

   2.1. Agent signature

   In Unified User-Agent String signature contains two main parts
   separated by space:

INTERNET-DRAFT    Unified User-Agent String (UUAS)     27 January 2012


   o Agent identifier, containing name and version of Agent - Section
      2.1.1

   o Agent features, containing information about Agent platform. -
      Section 2.1.2

   General ABNF notation of Agent signature is:

        agent = agent_id SP agent_ft

2.1.1. Agent identifier

   Agent identifier contains two parts separated by a slash sign:

   o Agent name, e.g. "FooBrowser"

   o Agent version, e.g. "1.0"

   Characters allowed to use in Agent name are: small and capital
   letters and a minus sign. Characters allowed to use in Agent version
   are: digits, dot, a minus sign and small and capital letters.

2.1.2. Agent Features

   Data contained in Agent features are (in turn):

   1. Security level flag - Section 2.1.2.1

   2. Operating system - Section 2.1.2.2

   3. Hardware platform - Section 2.1.2.3

   4. Client language - Section 2.1.2.4

   5. OPTIONAL Contact - Section 2.1.2.5

   6. OPTIONAL Addition data - Section 2.1.2.6

   All of Agent features is contained in brackets. Data are separated by
   semicolon and space.

2.1.2.1. Security level flag

   Security level flag indicates client.s security level. This field may
   contain these values:

   o "N" - no encryption

INTERNET-DRAFT    Unified User-Agent String (UUAS)     27 January 2012


   o "I" - 40-bit encryption

   o "U" - encryption stronger than 40-bit.

2.1.2.2. Operating system

   Operating system field indicates client.s operating system, e.g.
   "Windows NT 6.1", "FreeBSD 8.7" or "Mac OS X 10.7".

   Characters allowed to be used in this field are: small and capital
   letters, digits, dot, a minus sign and space.

2.1.2.3. Hardware platform

   Hardware platform field indicates client.s processor.s Instruction
   Set Architecture, e.g. "i386", "ppc" or "m68k".

   Character allowed to be used in this field are: small and capital
   letters, digits, dot and a minus sign. Maximum length of this field
   is 10 characters.

2.1.2.4. Client language

   This field indicates client application.s language. It may contain
   language tags defined in [RFC5646].

2.1.2.5. Contact

   This field contains one HTTP URL and zero or more client application-
   related e-mail addresses.

   URL and e-mail addresses are preceded by a plus sign. All subfields
   are separated by a semicolon and a space.

   ABNF notation of this field is here:

     contact = curl *(break cemail)
     curl = plus <rfc1738-httpurl>
     cemail = plus <rfc5322-addr-spec>

2.1.2.6. Additional data

   Additional data field can contain any data. All subfields are
   separated by semicolon and space.

   Characters allowed to be used in this field are: characters x20-x24,
   x26-x27, x2A-x2E, x30-x3A, x3C-x7E and hexadecimal-defined characters

INTERNET-DRAFT    Unified User-Agent String (UUAS)     27 January 2012


   Hexadecimal-defined character ABNF notation is here:

     hexchar = %x25 2HEXDIG

   This is ABNF notation of Additional data (one):

     addit_data = break 1*adchar

   2.2. Engine signature

   Engine signature indicates information about basis of the client
   application, e.g. HTML rendering engine. This signature contains two
   parts separated by space:

   o Engine identifier - structure identical as in Agent identifier

   o OPTIONAL Engine information - Section 2.2.1

   ABNF notation of Engine signature is:

     engine = engine_id *1(SP engine_if)

2.2.1. Engine information

   This field contains contact information and/or other data about
   engine separated by semicolon and space.

   This is ABNF notation of Engine information:

     engine_if = obracket (1* adchar / contact) *addit_data cbracket

      plus = %x2B

      break = %x3B SP
      hexchar = %x25 2HEXDIG

      nmchar = ALPHA / "-"
      vrchar = nmchar / DIGIT / "."
      adchar = %x20-24 / %x26-27 / %x2A-2E / %x30-3A / %x3C-7E / hexchar

3. Security Considerations

   Security is truly believed to be irrelevant to this document.
