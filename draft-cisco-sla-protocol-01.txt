1.  Introduction

   Network performance measurements are becoming critical data points
   for administrators monitoring the health of the network.  As Service
   Providers look to differentiate their offerings, performance
   measurement is an important tool to monitor Service Level guarantees
   and, in general, is a useful tool for administrators to monitor the
   health of a network.

   Performance metrics can be used for pre-deployment validation as well
   as for measuring in-band live network performance characteristics.
   Cisco's Service Level Assurance Protocol measures both round trip and
   one-way metrics.  It can be used to measure service levels in L2 and
   L3 networks and applications running on top of L3.  The performance
   measurement is achieved by actively generating synthetic test packets
   and sending them across the network, and analyzing those packets and
   packets that are returned in response.  This is in contrast to
   passive measurements that analyze production traffic flowing through
   a particular network element.

   The Cisco Service Level Assurance Protocol has a rich set of
   measurement types that can be classified as those that test
   connectivity (ping like) by providing round trip or, one-way latency
   measures and those that provide a greater variety of statistics
   including network jitter and packet/frame loss.  Each type of active
   measurement simulates an actual protocol exchange.

   The UDP measurement type message exchanges, as covered in this
   document, simulates an UDP application and can be used to simulate
   both Voice and Video traffic that is carried in RTP frames within UDP
   envelopes.  The UDP measurement type message exchanges carry
   information that provide the ability to derive a robust set of
   statistics.


2.  Protocol

   The Cisco Service Level Assurance Protocol consists of two distinct
   phases, the Control Phase and the Measurement Phase.  Each phase is
   comprised of exchange of information between a network element acting
   as the Sender and another element designated as the Responder.

   The Control Phase is the first phase of message exchanges and forms
   the base protocol.  This phase establishes the identity of the Sender
   and provides information for the Measurement Phase.  A single message
   pair of Control Request and Control Response marks this phase.  The
   Sender initiates a Control Request message that is acknowledged by
   the Responder with a Control Response message.  The Control Request

   may be sent multiple times if a Control Response has not been
   received; the number of times the message is retried is configurable
   on the Sender element.

   The Measurement Phase forms the second phase and is comprised of a
   sequence of Request/Response messages.  These messages may be
   exchanged as often as required.  Each Measurement Request message is
   acknowledged by the Responder with a Measurement Response Message.

   The number and frequency with which messages are sent SHOULD be
   controlled by configuration on the Sender element, along with the
   waiting time for a Control Response.

   The following sequence diagram depicts the message exchanges:

2.1.  Control Phase

   The Control Phase begins with the Sender sending a Control Request
   message to the Responder.  The Control Request message is sent to UDP
   port 1167 on the Responder requesting a measurement phase UDP port be
   opened and indicates the requested amount of time that the port needs
   to be opened for.  The Responder replies by sending a Control
   Response with appropriate Status indicating Success when the sender
   identity is verified (if used) and that the UDP port was successfully
   opened.  In all other cases a non-zero Status is returned.

   The sequence of exchanges is as indicated in the diagram.

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                                +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

2.1.1.  Control Request

   The Control Request message consists of a Command Header followed by
   one or more Command, Status, Length and Data sections (henceforth
   known as CSLD).  At the minimum, there SHOULD be at the least two
   CSLD sections, one of which is the authentication CSLD section and
   the other carries information for the Measurement Phase simulation
   type.

   The sequence number field MUST include a new number for each new
   request and is monotonically increasing.  When the Control Request is
   to be retried, the sequence number MUST remain unchanged.

2.1.1.2.  CSLDs

   The two CSLDs to be included, in order, along with the Command Header
   are:

   o  The Authentication CSLD

   o  A Measurement Type CSLD

   In this revision of the protocol, only a single Measurement Type CSLD
   has been defined, the UDP Measurement Type CSLD.  For future
   extensions it is possible to add additional Measurement Type CSLDs.
   For more details please see the section on Extensions.

2.1.1.2.1.  Authentication CSLD

   The Authentication CSLD provides the message authentication and
   verifies the requester knows the shared-secret.  The following is the
   format for the Authentication CSLD

2.1.2.  Control Response Message

   In response to the Control Request Message the network element
   designated the Responder sends back a Control Response Message that
   reflects the Command Header with an updated Status field and includes
   the two CSLD sections that also carry updated Status fields.  Hence,
   the format is identical to the Control Request message as described
   above.

   Following table shows the supported values of the Status fields:

   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+

   The Command Header Status indicates Success only if all the CSLD
   sections have Status as Success.  It is non-zero otherwise.  Future
   extensions MAY extend these values as appropriate.

   The Control Response message, besides the update of the Status
   fields, SHOULD also update the Sent Timestamp (if used) in the
   Command Header and the Message Authentication Digest in the
   Authentication CSLD.  The Message Authentication Digest is computed
   in the same way as the Control Request message.  The Random Number
   field can be reflected without modification.  The Session Identifier
   MAY be updated to reflect a locally significant unique value, MUST be
   0 if not specified.

2.2.  Measurement Phase

   Upon receiving the Control Response message with the Status set to
   Success, the second phase of the protocol, the Measurement Phase, is
   initiated.  In all other cases when the Status is not success no
   measurement traffic is initiated.  In the Measurement Phase the
   Sender sends a stream of measurement messages.  The measurement
   message stream consists of packets/frames that are spaced a
   configured number of milliseconds apart.

   The format of the Measurement messages as defined by this document
   for UDP Measurements is as shown below and is the same for the
   exchange in both directions, that is the format is the same when sent
   from the Sender to the Responder and when sent back from the
   Responder to the Sender with the only difference being the update of
   those fields that are designated with the Responder prefix, all other
   fields MUST remain unchanged.

   |             |           | 512 bytes and this field will be of     |

   Note: All timestamps have the format as described in RFC 5905
   [RFC5905] and is as follows: the first 32 bits represent the unsigned
   integer number of seconds elapsed since 0h on 1 January 1900; the
   next 32 bits represent the fractional part of a second thereof.  The
   timestamp definition is also similar to RFC 4656 [RFC4656]


3.  Implementation notes

   Responder implementations SHOULD support simultaneous measurements
   destined to a single port either from the same or a different Sender.
   For different measurements that originate from the same sender, there
   MUST be a clear method for the Responder to distinguish the traffic,
   for example per a unique 5-tuple of protocol, source address, source
   port, destination address and destination port.

   A Control Request that is received for the same measurement request
   as identified by the 5-tuples, for instance, SHOULD result in the
   resetting of the duration timer as well as the Responder Sequence
   Number.

   A Control Phase followed by the Measurement Phase can be repeated to
   have continuous measurement over the entire time a device is alive.

   The Random Number field in the Measurement packets is to be set to a
   random value in environments where security is a concern.  It MUST
   always be included, when not used it MUST be set to all 0s.

   The Authentication CSLD MUST always be included.  When the mode field
   is set to 0, the Random Number field and the Message Authentication
   Digest MUST both be set to all 0s.  For the SHA256 authenticator mode
   the shared secret is prepended to the Control Message and the
   authentication algorithm is then run over the complete data including
   the shared secret.

   If the UDP port indicated in the UDP Measurement CSLD is busy, the
   Responder MAY suggest an alternative port, the Status of the UDP
   Measurement CSLD MUST be set to Success in that case.  The Sender MAY
   set a value of 0 in the field, in which case the Responder MAY choose

Internet-Draft             Cisco SLA Protocol                   May 2012


   to open a port and send that back along with the Status of Success.
   It should be noted that this behavior has security ramifications and
   the port needs to be chosen very carefully by the Responder.

   The measurement stream typically consists of packets/frames with a
   periodic inter-packet distribution.  The Sender need not wait for a
   Measurement Response packet to arrive before sending another
   Measurement Request packet, and in many cases it will not be possible
   in order to maintain the desired inter-packet distribution.

   All messages and all fields within a message are assumed to be in
   network order.  In addition, all data fields are unsigned unless
   mentioned otherwise.


4.  Extensions

   This section describes how the protocol can be extended to allow for
   additional functionality, such as new types of measurements.

   In order to allow for new types of measurements, additional
   Measurement Type CSLDs can be defined, to be carried in place of the
   UDP Measurement CSLD defined in this document within the Control
   Request and Control Response messages.  The meaning and precise
   format of such CSLD needs to be defined in a separate specification.
   Such a specification will also need to describe the appropriate
   formats for the messages in the Measurement Phase.

   In addition, the protocol can be extended by adding support for new
   registry values for registries defined in this document.


5.  IANA Considerations

   The following registries are needed to maintain the extensibility of
   the protocol.

   Command Messages is different from the basic Command Header and CSLD
   structure described in this document.

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Message Authentication

   When the mode for the Authentication CSLD is set to 1, the Message
   Authentication Digest is generated using the SHA 256 algorithm and is
   to be calculated over the entire packet including the Message
   Authentication Digest field which MUST be set to all 0s.

   When the mode for the Authentication CSLD is set to 2, the Message
   Authentication Digest is generated using the HMAC-SHA-256 as
   described in RFC 4868 [RFC4868]algorithm and is to be calculated over
   the entire packet including the Message Authentication Digest field
   which MUST be set to all 0s

   When the mode field is set to 0, the Random Number field and the
   Message Authentication Digest MUST both be set to all 0s.

6.2.  IPSec Considerations

   It is RECOMMENDED that IPSec be employed to afford better security.
   IPSec provides enhanced privacy as well as an automated key
   distribution mechanism.  The following recommendations are similar to
   RFC3579, Section 2 [RFC3579]

6.2.1.  Control Traffic

   For Senders implementing this specification, the IPSec policy would
   be "Initiate IPSec, from me to any, destination port UDP 1167".  This
   causes the Sender to initiate IPSec when sending Control traffic to
   any Responder.  If some Responders contacted by the Sender do not
   support IPSec, then a more granular policy will be required, such as
   "Initiate IPSec, from me to IPSec-Capable-Responder, destination port
   UDP 1167".

   For Responders implementing this specification, the IPSec policy
   would be "Require IPSec, from any to me, destination port UDP 1167".
   This causes the Responder to require use of IPSec.  If some Sender
   does not support IPSec, then a more granular policy will be required:
   "Require IPSec, from IPSec-Capable-Sender to me".

6.2.2.  Measurement Traffic

   As the Control Phase occurs before the Measurement Phase, it should
   be possible to build an IPSec Security Association once a successful
   Control Response is received.

   For Senders implementing this specification, the IPSec policy would



Murtaza S. Chiba, et al.  Expires November 23, 2012            [Page 22]

Internet-Draft             Cisco SLA Protocol                   May 2012


   be "Initiate IPSec, from me to negotiated address, destination is
   negotiated port".  This causes the Sender to initiate IPSec when
   sending Measurement traffic to the Responder.  If some Responders
   contacted by the Sender do not support IPSec, then a more granular
   policy will be required, such as "Initiate IPSec, from me to IPSec-
   Capable-Responder, destination is negotiated port".

   For Responders implementing this specification, the IPSec policy
   would be "Require IPSec, from negotiated address to me, destination
   is negotiated port".  This causes the Responder to require use of
   IPSec.  If some Sender does not support IPSec, then a more granular
   policy will be required: "Require IPSec, from IPSec-Capable-Sender to
   me, destination is negotiated port".

6.3.  Replay Protection

   For the Control Messages the originator of the message MAY choose to
   include a current value in the Sent Timestamp field indicating the
   time the message was submitted for transmission, it MUST be set to 0
   otherwise.  The receiver of the message MAY choose to validate if the
   timestamp is within an acceptable range.  The Measurement Traffic
   described in this document contains a timestamp to indicate the sent
   time and hence no new field is required.
