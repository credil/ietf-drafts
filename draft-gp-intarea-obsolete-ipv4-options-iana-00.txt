             Formally Obsoleting some Historic IPv4 Options
             draft-gp-intarea-obsolete-ipv4-options-iana-00

Abstract

   A number of IPv4 options have become obsolete in practice, but have
   never been formally obsoleted.  This document obsoletes such IPv4
   options, thus cleaning up the corresponding IANA registry, and
   serving as a basis for providing advice about the filtering of
   packets containing these options.

Internet-Draft           Obsoleting IPv4 Options           February 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) [RFC0791] provides for
   expansion of the protocol by supporting a number of "options" in the
   variable-length IPv4 header.  IPv4 options are identified by an
   option "type" value, whose registration is managed by IANA [IANA-IP].
   A number of IPv4 options have become obsolete in practice, but have
   never been formally obsoleted.  This document obsoletes such IPv4
   options, "cleaning up" the corresponding IANA registry.


2.  Discussion of Obsoleted Options

2.1.  Stream ID

   The Stream ID option is obsolete.  It is specified in RFC 791
   [RFC0791], and obsoleted in Section 3.2.1.8 of RFC 1122 [RFC1122] and
   Section 4.2.2.1 of RFC 1812 [RFC1812].

2.2.  Extended Internet Protocol

   The Extended Internet Protocol option is defined in [RFC1385], and is
   superseded by [RFC2460].

2.3.  Traceroute

   The Traceroute option is defined in [RFC1393].  The Traceroute option
   is defined as "experimental" and it was never widely deployed on the
   public Internet.

2.4.  Address Extension

   The Address Extension option is defined in the Experimental
   [RFC1475], and marked as IPv7.

2.5.  Selective Directed Broadcast

   The Selective Directed Broadcast option is originally defined in
   [RFC1770].

2.6.  Dynamic Packet State

   The Dynamic Packet State option was specified in
   [I-D.stoica-diffserv-dps].  The aforementioned document was meant to
   be published as "Experimental", but never made it into an RFC.

2.7.  Upstream Multicast Pkt.

   This options was originally specified in [draft-farinacci-bidir-pim].
   Its use was obsoleted by [RFC5015], which employs a control plane
   mechanism to solve the problem of doing upstream forwarding of
   multicast packets on a multi-access LAN.


3.  IANA Considerations

   The "IP OPTION NUMBERS" registry [IANA-IP] contains the list of the
   currently assigned IP option numbers.  This registry also denotes an
   obsoleted IP Option Number by marking it with a single asterisk
   ("*").

   This document formally obsoletes the following options, and requests
   IANA to mark them as such in the corresponding registry [IANA-IP].

   Copy Class Number Value Name                               Reference
   ---- ----- ------ ----- ------------------------------- ------------
      1     0      8   136 SID    - Stream ID              [RFC791,JBP]*
      0     0     11    11 MTUP   - MTU Probe                 [RFC1191]*
      0     0     12    12 MTUR   - MTU Reply                 [RFC1191]*
      1     0     17   145 EIP    - Extended Internet Protocol[RFC1385]*
      0     2     18    82 TR     - Traceroute                [RFC1393]*
      1     0     19   147 ADDEXT - Address Extension    [Ullmann IPv7]*
      1     0     21   149 SDB    - Selective Directed Broadcast[Graff]*
      1     0     23   151 DPS    - Dynamic Packet State        [Malis]*
      1     0     24   152 UMP    - Upstream Multicast Pkt. [Farinacci]*



4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not modify the security properties of the IPv4
   Options being obsoleted.  However, formally obsoleting these options
   serves as a basis for e.g. providing advice about filtering packets
   containing these options (as in
   [I-D.gont-opsec-ip-options-filtering]).


5.  Acknowledgments

   The authors would like to thank Ron Bonica for his guidance.

   The authors would like to thank Ran Atkinson, Fred Baker, Dino
   Farinacci, and Andrew Malis for providing insights on some of the
   options being formally obsoleted by this document.
