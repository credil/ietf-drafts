1.  Introduction

   CDC (Cloud Data Center) network has the fastest innovation of the
   network standards and the most proposed technology.  Especially in
   the public clouds.  From our prespective, there are several network
   capacity can be sold by public clouds' operator: IP address, VLAN,
   bandwidth, loadbalance, firewall and some other network resouces.
   The target of NAAS(network as a service) is to provide end to end
   virual network with above capacity for tenants in datacenter.
   However, many taditional tochonlogy become the bottleneck of public
   cloud service, such as the number of VLAN.  It becomes unable to meet
   the constantly updated needs of providing users with the hosted
   networks for the data segregation.

   In this draft, we forcus on proposing network requirement of NAAS.

2.  Problem statement

   NAAS is supposed to provide a virtual CDC network for a tenant. we
   propose four specific network features of NAAS as follows

   a. The isolation of different tenants

   Different tenants are isolated by vpn, No matter layer 2 or layer 3,
   no matter by vlan tag or mpls tag or some others.  Meanwhile, the
   network service devices, such as loadbalance and firewall, also need
   to be isolated.tenants have a logical isolated network, which can be
   implement any IP and VLAN by themselves (different tenants should
   reused IP/VLAN).

   b. tenant's logical network in GUI

   tenant's logical network GUI should be simple and intuitive.  For
   example it only display a L2 switch, a L3 gateway, a broader router,
   a loadbalance, a firewall and some other security devices.  All the
   link is logical.  VMs or servers connect to these logical network
   devices.

   c. bandwidth guarantee

   Each logical network should allocate the specific end to end
   bandwidth, including server uplink switch port rate, switch to
   gateway link rate, gateway to LB/FW link rate and broader router link
   rate.

   all the logical bandwidth allocation should map in physical network
   devices.

   d. self network management

   Each tenant manage and config their own logical network.  While
   operator is responsible for the physical one.

3.  Solution

   to be continued.
