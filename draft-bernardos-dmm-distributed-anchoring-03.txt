Abstract

   Distributed Mobility Management solutions allow for setting up
   networks so that traffic is distributed in an optimal way and does
   not rely on centralized deployed anchors to provide IP mobility
   support.

   There are many different approaches to address Distributed Mobility
   Management, as for example extending network-based mobility protocols
   (like Proxy Mobile IPv6), or client-based mobility protocols (as
   Mobile IPv6), among others.  This document follows the former
   approach, and proposes a solution based on Proxy Mobile IPv6 in which
   mobility sessions are anchored at the last IP hop router (called
   distributed gateway).  The distributed gateway is an enhanced access
   router which is also able to operate as local mobility anchor or
   mobility access gateway, on a per prefix basis.  The draft focuses on
   the required extensions to effectively support simultaneously
   anchoring several flows at different distributed gateways.

   This draft introduces the concept of distributed logical interface
   (at the distributed gateway), which is a software construct that
   allows to easily hide the change of anchor from the mobile node.
   Additionally, the draft describes how to provide session continuity
   in inter-domain scenarios in which dynamic tunneling or signaling
   between distributed gateways from different operators is not allowed.

1.  Introduction

   The Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) paradigm aims at minimizing
   the impact of currently standardized mobility management solutions,
   which are centralized (at least to a considerable extent).

   Centralized mobility solutions, such as Mobile IPv6 or the different
   macro-level mobility management solutions of 3GPP EPS, base their
   operation on the existence of a central entity (e.g., HA, LMA, PGW or
   GGSN) that anchors the IP address used by the mobile node and is in
   charge of coordinating the mobility management (MM) (sometimes helped
   by a third entity like the MME or the HSS).  This central anchor
   point is in charge of tracking the location of the mobile and
   redirecting its traffic towards its current topological location.
   While this way of addressing mobility management has been fully
   developed by the Mobile IP protocol family and its many extensions,
   there are also several limitations that have been identified
   [I-D.chan-distributed-mobility-ps].  Among them, we can just
   highlight sub-optimal routing, scalability problems (in the network
   and in the centralized anchor) and reliability
   [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements].

   Several DMM-based approaches are being proposed and explored now
   [I-D.ietf-dmm-best-practices-gap-analysis], [commag.dmm-standards].
   One of them is based on extending network-based mobility protocols
   (such as Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] or GTP) to operate in
   distributed fashion.  This document proposes a solution that falls in
   this category, defining a new logical entity, called Distributed
   Gateway (D-GW) which basically encompasses the functionalities of
   plain IPv6 access router, MAG and LMA, on a per-IPv6 prefix basis.
   The main contribution of this draft is the definition of the
   mechanisms required to support the operation of such a network-based
   mobility solution when several flows are simultaneously anchored at
   different D-GWs, by introducing the concept of Distributed Logical
   Interface (DLIF).  The document also defines the required PMIPv6
   signaling extensions.  Last, but not least, the solution is also
   extended to provide session continuity across different domains.


2.  Terminology

   The following terms used in this document are defined in the Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 specification [RFC5213]:

      Local Mobility Anchor (LMA)

      Mobile Access Gateway (MAG)

      Mobile Node (MN)

      Binding Cache Entry (BCE)

      Proxy Care-of Address (P-CoA)

      Proxy Binding Update (PBU)

      Proxy Binding Acknowledgment (PBA)

   The following terms are defined and/or used in this document:

   D-GW (Distributed Gateway).  First IP hop router used by the mobile
      node.  It provides an IPv6 prefix (topologically anchored at the
      D-GW) to each attaching mobile node.

   Anchoring D-GW.  A previously visited D-GW anchoring an IPv6 prefix
      which is still used by a mobile node.

   Serving D-GW.  The D-GW the MN is currently attached to.

   DLIF (Distributed Logical Interface).  It is a logical interface at
      the IP stack of the D-GW.  For each active prefix used by the
      mobile node, the serving D-GW has a DLIF configured (associated to
      the anchoring D-GW).  In this way, a serving D-GW exposes itself
      towards each MN as multiple routers, one per active anchoring
      D-GW.

   HSS (Home Subscriber Server).  In a 3GPP architecture, it is the
      master user database that contains the subscription-related
      information (subscriber profiles), performs authentication and
      authorization of the user, and can provide information about the
      subscriber's location and IP information.


3.  Solution's overview

   A new logical network entity, called Distributed Gateway (D-GW) is
   introduced at the edge of the network, close to the MN.  It
   implements the functionality of a plain IPv6 access router (AR), a
   mobile access gateway (MAG) and a local mobility anchor (LMA), on a
   per-MN and per-IPv6-prefix, as described later.

   The solution basically extends Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] to behave
   in a distributed fashion, similarly as what has been proposed in
   [I-D.seite-dmm-dma] and [I-D.bernardos-dmm-pmip].  This is achieved
   by the D-GW logically behaving as a distributed mobility anchor,
   which comprises the following:

   o  When a mobile node attaches to a D-GW (initial attachment or
      handover), the D-GW provides an IPv6 prefix to the MN, acting as a
      regular IPv6 router (with the only difference that the delegated
      prefix is only assigned to one single MN, not being shared with
      any other node).  The D-GW that the mobile node is currently
      attached to is called "serving D-GW".

   o  When a mobile node performs a handover, it attaches to a new D-GW
      and configures a new IPv6 address out of the prefix provided and
      anchored by the new serving D-GW.  As before, the serving D-GW
      behaves as a plain IPv6 router for that particular MN and the
      delegated (locally anchored) prefix.  If the MN has active traffic
      using addresses anchored by other D-GWs (which are called
      "anchoring D-GWs") or it just needs to keep the reachability of
      these addresses, the current serving D-GW also acts as MAG, by
      sending the required proxy binding update (PBU) to the
      corresponding anchoring D-GWs.  The anchoring D-GWs therefore
      behave as LMA for this particular MN and the IPv6 prefixes they
      are anchoring, replying with a PBA.

   o  Once the PBU/PBA signaling is completed, a bidirectional tunnel is
      established between the serving D-GW and the anchoring D-GW (one
      per D-GW anchoring an active prefix used by the MN).  These
      tunnels are used to provide IP address continuity to prefixes that
      are not anchored at the serving D-GW.

   o  The means for a serving D-GW to obtain the information about the
      prefixes that a locally attached mobile node wants to keep
      reachable, and the associated anchoring D-GWs are out of the scope
      of this draft.  Among the possible mechanisms that can be used to
      let the D-GW know about the prefixes that should be kept
      reachable, we can cite for instance layer-2 triggers/signaling.
      Regarding the mapping of IPv6 prefixes to anchoring D-GWs, there
      might be either fully distributed mechanisms in place, or the
      information can be maintained in a centralized repository (e.g.,
      in the HSS, using a centralized LMA [I-D.bernardos-dmm-pmip],
      etc.).

   The basic operation of the solution is shown with an example in
   Figure 1.  MN1 attaches to D-GW1 (thus becoming its serving D-GW) and
   configures an IPv6 address (prefA::MN1) out of a prefix locally
   anchored at D-GW1 (prefA::/64).  At this point, MN1 can communicate
   with any correspondent node of the Internet, being the traffic
   anchored at D-GW1.  If later on MN1 moves to D-GW2, a new IPv6
   address (PrefB::MN1) is configured by the mobile node, this time out
   of prefB::/64, which is anchored at D-GW2 (which becomes the new
   serving D-GW).  D-GW2 also exchanges the required PBU/PBA signaling
   to ensure that data traffic using prefA::MN1 still reaches the mobile

4.1.  The Distributed Logical Interface (DLIF) concept

   One of the main challenges of a network-based DMM solution is how to
   allow a mobile node to simultaneously send/receive traffic which is
   anchored at different D-GWs, and how to influence on the preference
   of the mobile selecting the source IPv6 address for a new
   communication, without requiring special support on the mobile node
   stack.  This document defines the Distributed Logical Interface
   (DLIF), which is a software construct that allows to easily hide the
   change of anchor from the mobile node.

    Figure 2: DLIF: exposing multiple routers (one per active anchoring
                                   D-GW)

   The basic idea of the DLIF concept is the following.  Each serving
   D-GW exposes itself towards a given MN as multiple routers, one per
   active anchoring D-GW associated to the MN.  Let's consider the
   example shown in Figure 2, MN1 initially attaches to D-GW1,
   configuring an IPv6 address (prefA::MN1) from a prefix locally
   anchored at D-GW1 (prefA::/64).  At this stage, D-GW1 plays both the
   role of anchoring and serving D-GW, and also it behaves as a plain
   IPv6 access router.  D-GW1 creates a distributed logical interface to
   communicate (point-to-point link) with MN1, exposing itself as a
   (logical) router with a specific MAC (e.g., 00:11:22:33:01:01) and
   IPv6 addresses (e.g., prefA::DGW1/64 and fe80:211:22ff:fe33:101/64)

   using the DLIF mn1dgw1.  As explained below, these addresses
   represent the "logical" identity of D-GW1 towards MN1, and will
   "follow" the mobile node while roaming within the domain (note that
   the place where all this information is maintained and updated is
   out-of-scope of this draft; potential examples are to keep it on the
   HSS or the user's profile).

   If MN1 moves and attaches to a different D-GW of the domain (D-GW2 in
   the example of Figure 2), this D-GW will create a new logical
   interface (mn1dgw2) to expose itself towards MN1, providing it with a
   locally anchored prefix (prefB::/64).  In this case, since the MN1
   has another active IPv6 address anchored at a D-GW1, D-GW2 also needs
   to create an additional logical interface configured to exactly
   resemble the one used by D-GW1 to communicate with MN1.  In this
   example, there is only one active anchoring D-GW (in addition to
   D-GW2, which is the serving one): D-GW1, so only the logical
   interface mn1dgw1 is created, but the same process would be repeated
   in case there were more active anchoring D-GWs involved.  In order to
   maintain the prefix anchored at D-GW1 reachable, a tunnel between
   D-GW1 and D-GW2 is established and the routing is modified
   accordingly.  The PBU/PBA signaling is used to set-up the bi-
   directional tunnel between D-GW1 and D-GW2, and it might also be used
   to convey to D-GW2 the information about the prefix(es) anchored at
   D-GW1 and about the addresses of the associated DLIF (i.e., mn1dgw1).

   Figure 3 shows the logical interface concept in more detail.  The
   figure shows two D-GWs and three MNs.  D-GW1 is currently serving MN2
   and MN3, while D-GW2 is serving MN1.  MN1, MN2 and MN3 have two
   active anchoring D-GWs: D-GW1 and D-GW2.  Note that a serving D-GW
   always plays the role of anchoring D-GW for the attached (served)
   MNs.  Each D-GW has one single physical wireless interface.

   As introduced before, each MN always "sees" multiple logical routers
   -- one per active anchoring D-GW -- independently of to which serving
   D-GW the MN is currently attached.  From the point of view of the MN,
   these D-GWs are portrayed as different routers, although the MN is
   physically attached to one single interface .  The way this is
   achieved is by the serving D-GW configuring different logical
   interfaces.  If we focus on MN1, it is currently attached to D-GW2
   (i.e., D-GW2 is its serving D-GW) and, therefore, it has configured
   an IPv6 address from D-GW2's pool (e.g., prefB::/64).  D-GW2 has
   set-up a logical interface (mn1dgw2) on top of its wireless physical
   interface (phy if D-GW2) which is used to serve MN1.  This interface
   has a logical MAC address (LMAC6), different from the hardware MAC
   address (HMAC2) of the physical interface of D-GW2.  Over the mn1dgw2
   interface, D-GW2 advertises its locally anchored prefix prefB::/64.
   Before attaching to D-GW2, MN1 visited D-GW1, configuring also an
   address locally anchored at this D-GW, which is still being used by
   the MN1 in active communications.  MN1 keeps "seeing" an interface
   connecting to D-GW1, as if it were directly connected to the two
   D-GWs.  This is achieved by the serving D-GW (D-GW1) configuring an
   additional distributed logical interface: mn1dgw1, which behaves
   exactly as the logical interface configured by the actual D-GW1 when
   MN1 was attached to it.  This means that both the MAC and IPv6
   addresses configured on this logical interface remain the same
   regardless of the physical D-GW which is serving the MN.  The
   information required by a serving D-GW to properly configure this
   logical interfaces can be obtained in different ways: as part of the
   information conveyed in the PBA, from an external database (e.g., the
   HSS) or by other means.  As shown in the figure, each D-GW may have
   several logical interfaces associated to each attached MN, having
   always at least one (since a serving D-GW is also an anchoring D-GW
   for the attached MN).

   In order to enforce the use of the prefix locally anchored at the
   serving D-GW, the router advertisements sent over those logical
   interfaces playing the role of anchoring D-GWs (different from the
   serving one) include a zero prefix lifetime.  The goal is to
   deprecate the prefixes delegated by these D-GWs (which will be no
   longer serving the MN).  Note that on-going communications keep on
   using those addresses, even if they are deprecated, so this only
   affects to new sessions.

   The distributed logical interface concept also enables the following
   use case.  Suppose that access to a local IP network is provided by a
   given D-GW (e.g., D-GW1 in the example shown in Figure 2) and that
   the resources available at that network cannot be reached from
   outside the local network (e.g., cannot be accessed by an MN attached
   to D-GW2).  This is similar to the LIPA scenario currently being
   consider by 3GPP.  The goal is to allow an MN to be able to roam
   while still being able to have connectivity to this local IP network.
   The solution adopted to support this case makes use of RFC 4191
   [RFC4191] more specific routes when the MN moves to a D-GW different
   from the one providing access to the local IP network (D-GW1 in the
   example).  These routes are advertised through the distributed
   logical interface representing the D-GW providing access to the local
   network (D-GW1 in this example).  In this way, if MN1 moves from
   D-GW1 to D-GW2, any active session that MN1 may have with a node of
   the local network connected to D-GW1 will survive, being the traffic
   forwarded via the tunnel between D-GW1 and D-GW2.  Also, any
   potential future connection attempt towards the local network will be
   supported, even though MN1 is no longer attached to D-GW1.

4.2.  D-GW protocol operation

   This section describes the D-GW operation in more detail.

   Figure 4 shows an example of the D-GW operation:

   1.  MN1 attaches to D-GW1.  This event is detected by D-GW1 (based on
       layer 2 signaling/triggers or the reception of a Router
       Solicitation sent by MN1).

   2.  An IPv6 prefix from the pool of locally anchored prefixes is
       selected by D-GW1 to be delegated to MN1 (prefA::/64).  D-GW1
       sets up a distributed logical interface aimed at interfacing with
       MN1, called mn1dgw1.  D-GW1 starts sending router advertisements
       to MN1, including the delegated prefix.

   3.  D-GW1 learns if it is an attachment due to a handover (how this
       is done is out-of-scope of this draft).  In this case it is an
       initial attachment, so nothing else is required.

   4.  The DLIF mn1dgw1 is used by D-GW1 to advertise the locally
       anchored prefix (prefA::/64) to MN1.  Using this prefix, MN1
       configures an IPv6 address (prefA::MN1/64) that can be used to
       start new sessions (which will be anchored at D-GW1).  Traffic
       using the address prefA::MN1 is received at the interface mn1dgw1
       and directly forwarded by D-GW1 towards its destination.  Traffic
       between MN1 and the local network reachable via D-GW1 (localnet)
       is handled normally by D-GW1 (as MN1 is locally attached).

   5.  MN1 performs a handover to D-GW2.  This event is detected by
       D-GW2.

   6.  An IPv6 prefix from the pool of locally anchored prefixes is
       selected by D-GW2 to be delegated to MN1 (prefB::/64).  D-GW2
       sets up a distributed logical interface aimed at interfacing with
       MN1, called mn1dgw2.  D-GW2 starts sending router advertisements
       to MN1, including the delegated prefix.  Traffic using the
       address prefB::MN1 is received at the interface mn1dgw2 and
       directly forwarded by D-GW2 towards its destination.

   7.  D-GW2 learns that this is a handover of MN1, and that it
       previously visited D-GW1.  D-GW2 sends a PBU to D-GW1, which
       replies with a PBA.  This PBA MAY include information about the
       prefix(es) anchored at D-GW1, the parameters needed by D-GW2 to
       set-up the DLIF mn1dgw1, and the prefixes of local networks
       reachable via D-GW (if any).  Alternatively, this information MAY
       be obtained using a different approach (such as storing it in the
       HSS or some other external repository).  A bi-directional tunnel
       between D-GW1 and D-GW2 is set-up, as well as the required
       routing entries.

   8.  D-GW2 sets up the DLIF mn1dgw1, aimed at "logically" resembling
       D-GW1, so MN1 does not detect any change at layer-3.  D-GW2
       starts sending router advertisements to MN1 through mn1dgw2,
       which include the prefix anchored at D-GW1 (prefA::/64) with zero
       lifetime to deprecate the prefix (or alternatively it MAY include
       a low Default Router Preference [RFC4191] if communication to
       this D-GW is still needed in the future).  In this way, prefA::
       MN1 is not preferred for new communications.  The RAs MAY also
       include a Route Information Option (RIO) [RFC4191] with the
       prefix of localnet, which is the network that is only locally
       reachable via D-GW1 (e.g., as in the LIPA scenarios considered by
       the 3GPP), so MN1 picks D-GW1 (the "logical" version of it
       portrayed by D-GW2) when sending traffic to that network ,
       including the delegated prefix.  Traffic using the address
       prefA::MN1 is received at the interface mn1dgw1 and forwarded via
       the tunnel with D-GW1, which then forwards it towards its
       destination.  Traffic between MN1 and the network locally
       reachable via D-GW1 (localnet) is also handled via mn1dgw1 and
       sent through the tunnel.

4.3.  Message format

   This section defines extensions to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213]
   protocol messages.

4.3.1.  Proxy Binding Update

   A new flag (D) is included in the Proxy Binding Update to indicate
   that the Proxy Binding Update is coming from a Distributed Gateway
   and not from a mobile access gateway.  The rest of the Proxy Binding
   Update format remains the same as defined in [RFC5213].

   Distributed Gateway Flag (D)

      The Distributed Gateway Flag is set to indicate to the receiver of
      the message that the Proxy Binding Update is from a Distributed
      Gateway.

   Mobility Options

      Variable-length field of such length that the complete Mobility
      Header is an integer multiple of 8 octets long.  This field
      contains zero or more TLV-encoded mobility options.  The encoding
      and format of defined options are described in Section 6.2 of
      [RFC6275].  The distributed gateway MUST ignore and skip any
      options that it does not understand.

4.3.2.  Proxy Binding Acknowledgment

   A new flag (D) is included in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgment to
   indicate that the sender supports operating as a distributed gateway.
   The rest of the Proxy Binding Acknowledgment format remains the same
   as defined in [RFC5213].

   Distributed Gateway Flag (D)

      The Distributed Gateway Flag is set to indicate that the sender of
      the message supports operating as a distributed gateway.

   Mobility Options

      Variable-length field of such length that the complete Mobility
      Header is an integer multiple of 8 octets long.  This field
      contains zero or more TLV-encoded mobility options.  The encoding
      and format of defined options are described in Section 6.2 of
      [RFC6275].  The distributed gateway MUST ignore and skip any
      options that it does not understand.

4.3.3.  Anchored Prefix Option

   A new Anchored Prefix option is defined for use with the Proxy
   Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgment messages exchanged
   between distributed gateways.  This option is used for exchanging the
   mobile node's prefix anchored at the anchoring D-GW.  There can be
   multiple Anchored Prefix options present in the message.

   The Anchored Prefix Option has an alignment requirement of 8n+4.  Its
   format is as follows:

5.  Simultaneous anchoring of multiple flows (multiple operators)

   An MN may roam between D-GWs that do not belong to the same operator,
   and therefore might end up having multiple simultaneous flows,
   anchored at different operators.  Since dynamically setting up
   tunnels between different operators (i.e., between D-GWs belonging to
   different operators) is usually not supported, a solution should be
   devised to ensure session continuity in this scenario, even if it is
   at the cost of a sub-optimal routing.

   In this section we describe the required extensions to support inter-
   domain operation.  The basic solution consists in using a centralized
   LMA (usually located in the home domain) as top-level anchor to
   guarantee session continuity when crossing operator borders.  We
   assume that the necessary roaming agreements are in place in order to
   support setting up tunnels between the LMA located at the home domain
   of the MN and the visited D-GWs.

   Figure 5 shows an example of the inter-domain operation.  MN1
   initially attaches to D-GW1 (which belongs to OperatorA), and
   configures prefA::MN1 address out of one prefix anchored at D-GW1
   (prefA::/64).  If MN1 moves to D-GW2, which is managed by OperatorB,
   tunnels need to be established via the centralized LMA at the MN1's
   operators core, since we assume that no direct tunneling is possible
   between D-GWs belonging to different operators.  In this case, D-GW3

Internet-Draft        PMIPv6 distributed anchoring          October 2013


   establishes one tunnel with the centralized LMA to send/receive
   traffic using prefA::/64.  From the point of view of D-GW2, the
   operation is just as if the LMA was the D-GW anchoring this prefix.
   Analogously, the LMA establishes one tunnel with D-GW1 (from the
   point of view of D-GW1, the LMA is the current serving D-GW of MN1).
   Regarding the signaling, it is similar to the intra-operator
   scenario, though in this case the PBU/PBA sequence is performed
   twice, once between D-GW2 and the LMA, and another one between the
   LMA and D-GW1 (i.e., because two different tunnels are created).


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines new mobility options that require IANA actions.


7.  Security Considerations

   The protocol extensions defined in this document share the same
   security concerns of Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213].  It is recommended
   that the signaling messages, Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgment, exchanged between the distributed gateways, or
   between a distributed gateway and a centralized local mobility
   anchor, are protected using IPsec using the established security
   association between them.  This essentially eliminates the threats
   related to the impersonation of a distributed gateway or the local
   mobility anchor.

Appendix A.  Implementation experience

   The DLIF concept can be easily implemented using features that are
   usually available on several OSs.  Among the possible mechanisms that
   can be used to do it, the Linux macvlan support allows the creation
   of different logical interfaces over the same physical one.  Each
   logical interface appears as a regular interface to the Linux OS
   (which can be configured normally), and it supports configuring the
   MAC address exposed by the logical interface.  The destination MAC
   address is used by the OS to decide which logical interface

Internet-Draft        PMIPv6 distributed anchoring          October 2013


   (configured on top of a physical interface) is in charge of
   processing an incoming L2 frame.

   The EU FP7 MEDIEVAL project implemented a prototype of the DLIF
   concept using the Linux macvlan support, the radvd daemon, the Linux
   Advanced Routing and Traffic Control features and the standard
   iproute2 collection of utilities:

   o  The macvlan support enables iproute2 tools to be able to create,
      destroy and configure DLIFs on demand over a single physical
      interface.  One of the important features that needs to be
      configured is the logical MAC address exposed by the DLIF, as well
      as the IPv6 addresses, as they should remain the same regardless
      of the serving D-GW where the DLIF is configured.

   o  Since the distributed logical interfaces created using the macvlan
      support appear as regular network interfaces, they can be used
      normally in the radvd configuration file.  Them, by dynamically
      modifying the radvd configuration file and reloading it, we can
      control the router advertisements sent to each MN (e.g.,
      advertizing new IPv6 prefixes, deprecating prefixes anchored at
      other serving D-GWs, announcing RFC 4191 specific routes or
      changing router preferences).

   o  Each time a DLIF is created, it is also needed to properly
      configure source-based IPv6 routes, as well as tunnels (in case of
      handover).  This is supported by the Linux Advanced Routing and
      Traffic Control features.

   o  Last, but not least, current Linux kernels support the
      configuration of RFC 4191 specific routes (by processing Route
      Information Options contained in RAs).  The kernel support can be
      easily enabled by using the
      net.conf.ipv6.*.accept_ra_rt_info_max_plen kernel configuration
      parameter.


Appendix B.  Public demonstrations

   The DLIF concept has been demonstrated, together with the network-
   based DMM solution described in [I-D.bernardos-dmm-pmip], during the
   83rd IETF in Paris (March 2012) and the 87th IETF in Berlin (August
   2013).

   The first demo showcased a scenario composed of three "anchor
   routers", a "centralized LMA" for control plane, a "mobile node" and
   two "correspondent nodes" (one of them being a legacy IPv6 camera).
   The mobile node could move between the different anchor routers,

   getting a different locally anchor IPv6 address at each location, and
   being the reachability of each address maintained.

   In the second demo, integration with content delivery nodes (CDNs)
   was also shown, showcasing the advantages that the use of a DMM
   solution brings to this popular scenario.
