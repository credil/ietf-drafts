To use this XML template, the rfc2629.dtd from the xml2rfc distribution should 
be in the local directory. The xml2rfc distribution is available from 
http://xml.resource.org/

 The ENTITY clauses create an include of the named XML files, which
contains references written in xml2rfc format.

 XML2RFC offers an include feature described in the XML2RFC README
  file.  That syntax, however, contradicts the DTD requirements to
  have <reference> elements within the <references> element, so an 
  XML parser is likely to find your XML file invalid.  It may be
  possible that XML2RFC will change their DTD so that the XML file
  remains valid when their style of include is used.

Some editors, such as XXE, resolve the ENTITY clauses before displaying the 
document to be edited.

   swmSupportedTunnlTable subtree provides the information. According to section 4 of RFC

        <t>The swmEncapsTable subtree provides softwire mesh NLRI-NH  information about the AFBR. It 
        keeps the mapping between E-IP prefix and I-IP address of next hop. The mappings 
        determine which I-IP destination address will be used to encapsulate the received 
        packet's according to its E-IP destination address.

    <section title="Relationship to Other MIB Modules">

      <section title="Relationship to the IF-MIB">

   <t>The Interfaces MIB [RFC2863] defines generic managed objects for
   managing interfaces. Each logical interface (physical or virtual)
   has an ifEntry. Tunnels are handled by creating logical interfaces (ifEntry).
   Being a tunnel, softwire mesh has an entry in the Interface MIB, as well as 
   an entry in IP Tunnel MIB. Those corresponding entries are indexed by ifIndex.</t>
   
   <t>The ifOperStatus in the ifTable would be used to represents whether the
   mesh function of the AFBR has been triggered. If the software mesh
   capability is negotiated during the BGP OPEN phase, the mesh
   function is considered to be started, and the ifOperStatus is "up".
   Otherwise the ifOperStatus is "down".</t>
   
   <t>In the case of IPv4-over-IPv6 softwire mesh tunnel, the ifInUcastPkts counts
   the number of IPv6 packets which are sent to the virtual interface for
   decapsulation into IPv4. The ifOutUcastPkts counts the number of IPv6
   packets which are generated by encapsulating IPv4 packets sent to the
   virtual interface. Particularly, if these IPv4 packets need fragmentation, 
   ifOutUcastPkts counts the number of packets after fragmentation.</t>
   
   <t>In the case of IPv6-over-IPv4 softwire mesh tunnel, the ifInUcastPkts
   counts the number of IPv4 packets, which are sent to the virtual interface for
   decapsulation into IPv6. The ifOutUcastPkts counts the number of IPv4 packets, which
   are generated by encapsulating IPv6 packets sent to the virtual interface.
   Particularly, if these IPv6 packets need to be fragmented, tifOutUcastPkts counts
   the number of packets after fragmentation. Similar definition apply to other
   counting objects in ifTable. </t>

      </section>
      
      <section title="Relationship to the IP Tunnel MIB">

		<t>The IP Tunnel MIB [RFC4087] contains objects applicable to all IP
   tunnels, including softwire mesh. On the other hand, Softwire Mesh MIB extends the 
   IP tunnel MIB to further describe encapsulation-specific information.</t> 
   
   <t>Running a point to multi-point tunnel, it is necessary for a softwire mesh AFBR to
   maintain an encapsulation table, used to perform correct "forwarding" among AFBRs. This 
   forwarding on an AFBR is performed by using the E-IP destination address to look up the
   I-IP encapsulation destination address in the encapsulation table. An AFBR also needs to
   know the BGP peer information of the other AFBRs, so that it can negotiate the NLRI-NH 
   information and the tunnel parameters with them.</t>
   
	<t>Softwire mesh requires the implmentation of the IP Tunnel MIB. The tunnelIfEncapsMethod
   in the tunnelIfEntry should be set to softwireMesh("xx"), and corresponding entry in the 
   softwire mesh MIB module will exist for this tunnelIfEntry. The tunnelIfRemoteInetAddress
   must be set to 0.0.0.0 for IPv4 or :: for IPv6 because it is a point to multi-point tunnel.</t>
   
   <t>Since tunnelIfAddressType in tunnelIfTable represents the type of address in the 
   corresponding tunnelIfLocalInetAddress and tunnelIfRemoteInetAddress objects, we can use
   this semantic to specify the type of the softwire mesh, which is either IPv4-over-IPv6 or 
   IPv6-over-IPv4. When tunnelIfAddressType is IPv4, the mesh is IPv6-over-IPv4; When 
   tunnelIfAddressType is IPv6, the encapsulation would be IPv4-over-IPv6.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">

      <t>The swmMIB module can be used for configuration
   of certain objects, and anything that can be configured can be
   incorrectly configured, with potentially disastrous results.
   Because this MIB module reuses the IP tunnel MIB, the security 
   considerations of the IP tunnel MIB is also applicable to the Softwire
   mesh MIB.</t>
   
   		
   		<t>SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.</t>

   		<t>It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).</t>

   		<t>Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security. It is then a customer/operator's
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.</t>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
    
      <t>The MIB module in this document uses the following 
      IANA-assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI 
      Numbers registry, and the following IANA-assigned tunnelType 
      values recorded in the IANAtunnelType-MIB registry:

    <!-- References Section -->

    <!-- Section 4.7f of [RFC2223bis] specifies the requirements for the
   references sections.  In particular, there MUST be separate lists of
   normative and informative references, each in a separate section.
   The style SHOULD follow that of recently published RFCs.

   The standard MIB boilerplate available at
  the OPS Area web site includes lists of
   normative and informative references that MUST appear in all IETF
   specifications that contain MIB modules.  If items from other MIB
   modules appear in an IMPORTS statement in the Definitions section,
   then the specifications containing those MIB modules MUST be included
   in the list of normative references.  When items are imported from an
   IANA-maintained MIB module the corresponding normative reference
   SHALL reference the on-line version of that MIB module.  It is the
   policy of the RFC Editor that all references must be cited in the
   text;  such citations MUST appear in the overview section where
   documents containing imported definitions (other than those already
   mentioned in the MIB boilerplate) are required to be mentioned (cf.
   Section 3.2).

In general, each normative reference SHOULD reference the most recent
version of the specification in question.
