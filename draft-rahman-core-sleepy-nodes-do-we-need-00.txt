          Sleepy Devices: Do we need to Support them in CORE?
              draft-rahman-core-sleepy-nodes-do-we-need-00

Abstract

   This document summarizes the discussion in the CORE WG related to the
   question of whether support of sleepy devices is required for the
   CoAP protocol, CORE Link Format, CORE Resource Directory, etc.  The
   only goal of this document is to trigger discussions in the CORE WG
   so that all relevant considerations for sleeping devices are taken
   into account.

1.  Terminology and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document assumes readers are familiar with the terms and
   concepts that are used in [I-D.ietf-core-coap] and [RFC6690].

2.  Introduction

   At IETF-87 (Berlin), it was suggested to review/summarize the CORE WG
   interest on the topic of Sleepy Node support.  Specifically whether
   the WG feels that support of sleepy endpoints is required for the
   CoAP protocol, CORE Link Format, CORE Resource Directory, etc.
   Alternatively, whether the WG feels that Sleepy Node support can be
   completely done outside CORE such as in the lower Layer 2 (MAC)
   scheduling and/or in Layer 7 (application) logic.

3.  Drafts Related to Sleepy Nodes

   There have been multiple drafts in the CORE WG related to the subject
   of Sleepy Nodes including:

   o  [I-D.rahman-core-sleepy-problem-statement] summarizes the overall
      problem space of Sleepy Nodes.

   o  [I-D.cao-core-aol-req] defines requirements for Sleepy Nodes to
      behave as if they are "always on".

   o  [I-D.dijk-core-sleepy-reqs] defines requirements for Sleepy Nodes
      based on home and building control use cases.

   o  [I-D.rahman-core-sleeping] defines general requirements for Sleepy
      Nodes.

   o  [I-D.bormann-core-roadmap] provides a classification and overview
      of CORE drafts (and features) including a section on Sleepy Nodes.

   o  [I-D.arkko-core-sleepy-sensors] describes a sensor network
      implementation and shows how different communication models affect
      implementation complexity and energy consumption (including Sleepy
      Node support).

   o  [I-D.giacomin-core-sleepy-option] defines a proxy that acts as a
      store-and-forward agent for a Sleepy Node.

   o  [I-D.castellani-core-alive] defines a new CoAP message type which
      the Sleepy Node multicasts to all interested devices when it wakes
      up.

   o  [I-D.fossati-core-publish-option] allows an endpoint to
      temporarily delegate authority of its resources (when it is
      sleeping) to a proxy server that is always on.

   o  [I-D.fossati-core-monitor-option] extends the Observe
      functionality to handle the scenario when both the server and
      clients are Sleepy Nodes.

   o  [I-D.dijk-core-sleepy-solutions] defines an architectural approach
      to support Sleepy Nodes.

   o  [I-D.rahman-core-sleepy] defines new parameters that describe an
      endpoint's sleepy characteristics and stores them in the Resource
      Directory.

   o  [I-D.vial-core-mirror-server] defines a special type of Resource
      Directory from which endpoints can fetch the resource regardless
      of the (sleep) state of the server.

4.  WG Email List Poll for Sleepy Node Deliverable

Internet-Draft           Sleepy Devices for CORE            October 2013


   A poll was taken on the WG Email list asking the following question:
   "Should we have a CORE deliverable for CoAP support of Sleepy Nodes?"
   [IETF87-Poll].

   The results of the poll were as follows:

   o  Votes FOR a new CORE Sleepy Node support deliverable: 9

   o  Votes AGAINST a new CORE Sleepy Node support deliverable: 3

5.  Summary

   There have been over ten drafts related to the concept of CORE
   support of Sleepy Nodes.  The WG Email list poll on the topic had a
   large majority of responders supporting creation of a CORE charter
   item for support of Sleepy Nodes.  However there were some important
   and high profile dissenters that argued against such a charter item.
   Another point to consider is that during WG discussions, the CORE
   Mirror Server [I-D.vial-core-mirror-server]  is sometimes referred to
   as the "existing" solution for CORE Sleepy Node support.  However,
   this draft was never adopted as a WG draft.

6.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Carsten Bormann and Zach Shelby for valuable discussions
   and feedback on the topic of Sleepy Nodes.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

8.  Security Considerations

   Not applicable.
