                  Accurate ECN Feedback Option in TCP
              draft-kuehlewind-tcpm-accurate-ecn-option-00

Abstract

   This document specifies an TCP option to get accurate Explicit
   Congestion Notification (ECN) feedback from the receiver.  ECN is an
   IP/TCP mechanism where network nodes can mark IP packets instead of
   dropping them to indicate congestion to the end-points.  An ECN-
   capable receiver will feedback this information to the sender.  ECN
   is specified for TCP in such a way that only one feedback signal can
   be transmitted per Round-Trip Time (RTT).  Recently new TCP
   mechanisms like ConEx or DCTCP need more accurate feedback
   information in the case where more than one marking is received in
   one RTT.  This TCP extension can be used in addition to the classic
   ECN as well as with a more accurate ECN scheme recently proposed
   which reuses the ECN bit in the TCP header.

Internet-Draft     Accurate ECN Feedback Option in TCP      October 2011


1.  Introduction

   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [RFC3168] is an IP/TCP
   mechanism where network nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping
   them to indicate congestion to the end-points.  An ECN-capable
   receiver will feedback this information to the sender.  ECN is
   specified for TCP in such a way that only one feedback signal can be
   transmitted per Round-Trip Time (RTT).  Recently proposed mechanisms
   like Congestion Exposure (ConEx) or DCTCP [Ali10] need more accurate
   feedback information in case when more than one marking is received
   in one RTT.

   This documents specifies an TCP option to provide more than one ECN
   feedback signal per RTT.  This modification does not obsolete
   [RFC3168].  This TCP extension can be used in addition to the classic
   ECN as well as in addition to more accurate ECN scheme recently
   proposed which reuses the ECN bits in the TCP header for the same
   purpose than this extension --- more accurate ECN feedback (see
   [I-D.kuehlewind-conex-accurate-ecn]).  Note that a new TCP extension
   can experience deployment problems by middleboxes dropping unknown
   options.  Thus the ECN feedback in the TCP header is still needed to
   ensure ECN feedback.  Moreover, this option will increase the header
   length for all kind of TCP packets which causes additional load in
   case of severe congestion.

1.1.  Overview ECN and ECN Nonce in TCP

   ECN requires two bits in the IP header.  The ECN capability of a
   packet is indicated, when either one of the two bits is set.  An ECN
   sender can set one or the other bit to indicate an ECN-capable
   transport (ETC) which results in two signals --- ECT(0) and
   respectively ECT(1).  A network node can set both bits simultaneously
   when it experiences congestion.  When both bits are set the packets
   is regarded as "Congestion Experienced" (CE).

   ECN-Nonce [RFC3540] is an optional addition to ECN that is used to
   protects the TCP sender against accidental or malicious concealment
   of marked or dropped packets.  With ECN-Nonce a nonce sum is maintain
   that counts the occurrence of ECT(1) packets.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   We use the following terminology from [RFC3168] and [RFC3540]:

Internet-Draft     Accurate ECN Feedback Option in TCP      October 2011


   The ECN field in the IP header:

             CE: the Congestion Experienced codepoint; and

             ECT(0)/ECT(1): either one of the two ECN-Capable Transport
             codepoints.

   In this document, we will call the ECN feedback scheme as specified
   in [RFC3168] the 'classic ECN'.  A 'congestion mark' is defined as an
   IP packet where the CE codepoint is set.


2.  Negotiation of Accurate ECN feedback

   As there is only limited space in the TCP Options, particularly
   during the initial three-way handshake, an abbreviated Option is used
   to negotiate for Accurate ECN feedback.  This option also initiates
   all counters to an initial value of zero at the receiving side.


   TCP Accurate ECN Option Negotiation:

      Kind: TBD (same as above)

      Length: 2 bytes

      +------+-----+
      | Kind |  2  |
      +------+-----+
         1      1


          Figure 1: Accurate ECN feedback TCP option negotiation

   This abbreviated option is only valid in a <SYN> or <SYN,ACK>
   segment, during a three way handshake.  The negotiation follows the
   same procedure as with other TCP options, i.e.  SACK.  A TCP sender
   MAY send the accurate ECN feedback negotiation option in an initial
   SYN segment and MAY send a more accurate ECN option (see Section 3)
   in other segments only if it received this option negotiation in the
   initial <SYN> segment or <SYN,ACK> for the connection.  A TCP
   receiver MAY send an <SYN,ACK> segment with the accurate ECN feedback
   negotiation option in response to a received accurate ECN feedback
   negotiation option in the <SYN>.  If both ends indicate that they
   support Accurate ECN feedback, the option MUST be used in any
   subsequent TCP segment.

3.  Accurate ECN feedback Option Specification

   A TCP receiver, that provides accurate ECN feedback, will maintain a
   counter for the number of ECT(0), ECT(1), CE, non-ECT marked and lost
   packets.  The TCP option to provide the accurate ECN feedback to the
   sender will echo these counters (modulo 16) in five 2 byte fields.
   This option should be included in every ACK (and not only when a
   counter value changes) to ensure the reception of the ECN feedback at
   the sender in case of ACK loss.

   TCP Accurate ECN Option:

     Kind: TBD

     Length: 12 bytes

     +------+------+---------+---------+--------+---------+---------+
     | Kind |  12  | ECT(0)  | ECT(1)  |   CE   | non-ECT |  loss   |
     +------+------+---------+---------+--------+---------+---------+
        1      1        2         2        2         2         2


                Figure 2: Accurate ECN feedback TCP option

   The number of lost packet would be needed to calculate the ECN Nonce
   sum more exactly.  TCP provides anyway a mechanism to detect loss and
   lost needs to be assumes as a string signal for congestion anyway.
   Thus a TCP congestion control algorithm muss react on loss.
   Moreover, if TCP SACK is not available the exact number of lost
   packets is not known.

   The same feedback information are proposed for the (ECN) feedback in
   RTP (see [I-D.ietf-avtcore-ecn-for-rtp].

   As TCP is a bitdirectional protocol this option can be used in both
   directions.
