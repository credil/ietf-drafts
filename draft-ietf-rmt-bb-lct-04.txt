Layered Coding Transport (LCT) provides transport level
support for reliable content delivery and stream delivery
protocols.  LCT is specifically designed to support protocols
using IP multicast, but also provides support to protocols
that use unicast.  LCT is compatible with congestion control
that provides multiple rate delivery to receivers and is also
compatible with coding techniques that provide reliable
delivery of content.

This document is a product of the Reliable Multicast Transport Working
Group of the IETF.
