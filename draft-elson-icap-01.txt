ICAP, the Internet Content Adaption Protocol, is a protocol aimed
at providing simple object-based content vectoring for HTTP
services.  ICAP is, in essence, a lightweight protocol for
executing a "remote procedure call" on HTTP messages.  It allows ICAP
clients to pass HTTP messages to ICAP servers for some sort of
transformation or other processing ("adaptation").  The server
executes its transformation service on messages and sends back
responses to the client, usually with modified messages.  Typically,
the adapted messages are either HTTP requests or HTTP responses.
