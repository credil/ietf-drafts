Abstract

   This document describes the extension to BGP signaling for the E-Tree
   support in BGP VPLS when the dual-VLAN model is used as in [Vpls-
   etree]. The BGP VPLS messages and their procedures remain almost the
   same as in [RFC4761], only a new extended community for E-Tree is
   proposed.

1. Introduction

   Dual-VLAN can be used to support generic E-Tree services both in the
   Ethernet and in the VPLS. The solution proposed in [Vpls-etree] is
   fully compatible with the IEEE bridge architecture and the IETF PWE3
   technology, and VPLS scalability and simplicity is also well kept.
   With this mechanism, it is also convenient to deploy a converged E-
   Tree service across both Ethernet and MPLS networks.

   LDP signaling of E-Tree support in a PW is specified in Section 6 of
   [Vpls-etree], it can also be used together with BGP auto-discovery
   [RFC6074].

   This document further describes the BGP signaling extension to BGP
   VPLS for the E-Tree support and its processing procedures.



2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].



3. Terminology

   E-Tree: a Rooted-Multipoint EVC service according to the definition
   in MEF

   Root VLAN, a VLAN ID used to indicate all the frames that are
   originated at a root AC

   Leaf VLAN, a VLAN ID used to indicate all the frames that are
   originated at a leaf AC



4. BGP Extensions for E-Tree Support

   In the dual-VLAN VPLS PE model per [Vpls-etree], the PEs need to
   exchange their local VLANs when PW is set up by automatic signaling.
   A new E-Tree extended community is proposed for E-Tree signaling in
   BGP VPLS:

                   +------------------------------------+
                   | Extended community type (2 octets) |
                   +------------------------------------+
                   |  Root VLAN (2 octets)              |
                   +------------------------------------+
                   |  Leaf VLAN (2 octets)              |
                   +------------------------------------+
                   |  Reserved                        |P|
                   +------------------------------------+

   Where:

   o Root VLAN ID is the value of the local root VLAN.

   o Leaf VLAN ID is the value of the local leaf VLAN.

   o Reserved, 15 bits MUST be set to zero on transmit and be ignored
      on receive.

   o P is a Leaf-only bit, it is set to 1 to indicate that the PE is
      attached with only leaves, and set to 0 otherwise.

   The PEs attached with both leaves and roots must support BGP E-Tree
   signaling as described in this document, and must support VLAN
   mapping in their data planes. The traditional PE attached with only
   roots may also participate in an E-Tree.

   In BGP VPLS signaling, besides attaching a Layer2 Info Extended
   Community as detailed in [RFC4761], an E-Tree Extended Community MUST
   be further attached if a PE wishes to set up an E-Tree service. The
   PE MUST include its local root VLAN ID and leaf VLAN ID in the E-Tree
   Extended Community. A PE attached with only leaves of an E-Tree
   SHOULD set the P bit in the E-Tree Extended Community to 1.

   A PE that receives a BGP UPDATE message with an E-Tree Extended
   Community from its peer PE must process it as follows (a PE which
   does not recognize this attribute will silently ignore it):

   1) if the root and leaf VLAN ID in the E-Tree Extended Community
      match the local root and leaf VLAN ID, then continue to 3);

   2) else {

          if the bit V is cleared, then it MUST set VLAN-Mapping-Mode to
          TRUE;

          else the PE with the minimum IP address MUST set VLAN-Mapping-
          Mode to TRUE;

      }

   3) If the P bit is set, then the PE SHOULD set the Optimized-Mode to
      TRUE.

   If a PE has sent an E-Tree Extended Community but does not receive
   any E-Tree Extended Community from its peer, then set the Compatible-
   Mode to TRUE for the corresponding PW to the peer.

   Data plane in the VPLS is the same as described in Section 4.2 of
   [RFC4761], and data plane processing for a PW is the same as
   described in the end of Section 6 of [Vpls-etree].

5. Security Considerations

   Besides security considerations as described in [RFC4448] and
   [RFC4761], this solution prevents leaf to leaf communication in the
   data plane of VPLS when its PEs are interconnected with PWs. In this
   regard, security can be enhanced for customers with this solution.

6. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a value for E-Tree in the registry of
   BGP Extended Community.
