           Use case analysis for supporting flow mobility in DMM
             draft-sun-dmm-use-case-analysis-flowmob-dmm-01.txt


Abstract

   Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) allows network traffic to
   distribute among multiple mobility anchors which have mobility
   functions to solve the existing problems in current centralized
   mobility protocols. There are many DMM approaches extending network-
   based mobility protocols (e.g. Proxy Mobile IPv6).

   In Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213], they allow a mobile node to
   connect to PMIPv6 domain through different physical interfaces. In
   this reason, flow mobility that enables movement between physical
   interfaces of mobile node is proposed.

   In this document, we present some use cases to support flow mobility
   in DMM domain and analyze some problems. These use cases are based
   on scenarios of flow mobility in PMIPv6. In these scenarios, a
   multi-interface mobile node connects to different distributed
   mobility access points and move specific flows from one interface to
   another. These use cases have common issues which will be analyzed
   in detail.

1. Introduction

   Distributed Mobility Management aims at overcoming limitations of
   centralized mobility protocol, such as a single point failure,
   scalability and non-optimal routing. In [draft-ietf-dmm-best-
   practices-gap-analysis], they distribute existing mobility functions
   to access network, and show practices to use existing protocols
   (e.g. MIP, PMIP).

   When mobile node can use multiple interfaces and connect to network
   simultaneously or sequentially, flow mobility allows a mobile node

   to move specific traffic flows by using network status or policy. In
   NETEXT WG, [draft-ietf-netext-pmipv6-flowmob] explains about PMIPv6
   based flow mobility and proposes some scenarios for supporting that.

   In this document, we combine PMIPv6 based flow mobility with DMM
   architecture. [draft-seite-dmm-dma] mentions about multi-interface
   support for network based DMM but not in detail. This document
   refers DMM architecture and message flows from [draft-bernardos-dmm-
   distributed-anchoring] and [draft-seite-dmm-dma]. For supporting
   flow mobility in DMM, we also make some use cases based on three
   scenarios in [draft-ietf-netext-pmipv6-flowmob]. From analyzing
   these use cases, it would incline that multi-interface mobile node
   can connect to different distributed anchors and move traffic flows
   between physical interfaces.

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   The following terms used in this document are defined in the Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213]:

   Proxy Binding Update (PBU)

   Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (PBA)



   The following terms are defined in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 Extensions
   to Support Flow Mobility [draft-ietf-netext-pmipv6-flowmob]:

   FMI (Flow Mobility Initiate)

   FMA (Flow Mobility Acknowledgement)

   FMC (Flow Mobility Cache)

   The following terms are defined and used in this document:

   Distributed-Mobile Access Gateway (D-MAG): It provides an IP prefix
   to each attached mobile node. D-MAG is the topological anchor point
   of mobile node's prefix. It performs regular IPv6 routing for
   connecting mobile node directly and when mobile node moves and
   attaches to another D-MAG, similar to LMA in [RFC5213], it tracks
   the mobile node location and performs mobility routing to forward
   packets via D-MAG where mobile node is attached.

3. Use case scenario

   In PMIPv6-based DMM, distributed mobility anchors have functions of
   MAG and LMA. As shown in figure 1, distributed mobility anchors
   called Distributed Mobile Access Gateway (D-MAG) support same or
   different access technologies so that different physical interfaces
   of mobile node can access to D-MAG simultaneously or sequentially.
   When a mobile node attaches to network, the D-MAG may assign prefix
   and support regular IPv6 routing. When the mobile node moves to
   another D-MAG, previous D-MAG may perform as a mobility anchor like
   LMA which exchanges signaling messages (e.g. PBU/PBA) and supports
   mobility routing(e.g. tunneling).

   In [I-D.ietf-netext-logical-interface-support], logical interface is
   defined that allows the mobile node to move different traffic flows
   to different physical interfaces regardless of the assigned prefixes
   on those interfaces. By using the logical interface, mobile node can
   accept incoming packets which is addressed to another interface of
   mobile node. Flow mobility cache which is separated from the binding
   cache is defined [draft-ietf-netext-pmipv6-flowmob] to contain all
   registered flow information. This specification uses the format of
   flow binding list defined in [RFC6089]. Similarly to [draft-ietf-
   netext-pmipv6-flowmob], we assume that mobile node have logical
   interface and D-MAG includes flow cache entry. There are three use
   cases to support flow mobility in DMM.

     3.1. Use case 1

   The first possible use case, as shown in Figure 2, assumes that
   multiple interfaces attach to DMM network sequentially and movement
   of flow starts from the activation of secondary interface of mobile
   node. In this case, basic operation may follow normal PMIPv6
   protocol as follows:

   o When a mobile node initially attaches to the D-MAG1 using the
      physical interface if1, the D-MAG1 should assign prefix pref1 and
      support regular IPv6 routing. In this time, no mobility function
      is used. Mobile node may communicate with one or more
      corresponding nodes after receiving pref1 from D-MAG1. However,
      D-MAG1 SHOULD know the information of all flows used by if1 of
      mobile node. D-MAG1 already has binding cache entry and flow
      cache entry so it can update its own entries. TS option in the
      IPv6 header of packet can be used to update flow cache entry.

   o During the time, mobile node connects to D-MAG1 through the if1,
      it could enable another interface if2 to attach to D-MAG2. Upon
      D-MAG2 receives information (discussed about this operation
      later.), the D-MAG2 may send a PBU message to the D-MAG1 to
      request mobility routing. In the PBU message, it SHOULD include
      the mobile node identifier and the address of D-MAG1. It may also
      include the request for supporting flow mobility because the D-
      MAG1 does not observe that the mobile node connects to the D-MAG2
      by using the another interface.

   o When the D-MAG1 receives the PBU message, the D-MAG1 SHOULD make
      a tunnel first with the D-MAG2 and determine what flows will move
      to the D-MAG2. Decision method or policy for flow mobility is out
      of scope of this document. After decision, the D-MAG1 updates its
      binding cache entry and flow cache entry for moving flow.
      Finally, the D-MAG1 sends a PBA message to the D-MAG2 and
      forwards moving flows to the D-MAG2via tunnel. In the PBA
      message, additional contents, such as Flow Identification option
      [RFC6089] or the service type of flow, are needed to provide the
      flow information. After receiving the PBA message, the D-MAG2
      updates its routing table and delivers packets received from the
      D-MAG1 to if2. Independently, the D-MAG2 also SHOULD assign a new
      prefix to if2 for normal IPv6 routing because all D-MAGs have
      location management and address allocation function in DMM.



     3.2. Use case 2

   The second possible case, as shown in Figure 3, assumes that
   multiple interfaces attach to network simultaneously. Each interface
   has been assigned prefixes from the different D-MAGs. When several
   flows are already existed through both interfaces, basic operation
   will be as follows:

   o When the mobile node attaches to the different D-MAGs through
      multiple interfaces, each interface has been assigned different
      prefixes and managed separately. In this figure, if1 and if2 are
      connecting to the D-MAG1, D-MAG2 and using the pref1, the pref2,
      respectively. To support flow mobility, a special method in which
      both D-MAGs share information of mobile nodes attached to
      network, activated flows, and network policy (will discuss
      chapter 4) is needed.

   o In the certain time, when the network decides to move a specific
      flow, flow x in this figure, first both D-MAGs exchange PBU/PBA
      messages to bind prefix of mobile node's interface. However, in
      this case, the PBU/PBA messages are only for binding prefix. So
      D-MAG1 just updates binding cache entry but no traffic path is
      changed. To do this, the modification of PBU/PBA or functions of
      D-MAG may be needed. After exchanging signaling messages, tunnel
      is setup between the D-MAG1 and the D-MAG2, but no traffic flow
      moves through this interface yet.

   o Considering move a specific flow from the D-MAG1 to the D-MAG2,
      the D-MAG1 SHOULD send a request message for the D-MAG2 because
      the flow information is only stored in the D-MAG1. Since the D-
      MAG1 cannot send a PBA message which has not been triggered in
      response to a received PBU message, new signaling messages are
      defined to cover this case. In [draft-ietf-netext-pmipv6-flowmob-
      06], they defined a new signaling message, FMI/FMA message, which
      contains the MN-Identifier, the Flow Identification Mobility
      option information, and the type of flow mobility operation (add
      flow). Adjusting the scenario of this document in the DMM, the D-
      MAG2 may receive the FMI message from the D-MAG1, update the flow
      cache entry, and send a FMA message to reply. Finally, the flow
      will move to if2 via the D-MAG2 using mobility routing.



     3.3. Use case 3

   The last possible case, as shown in Figure 4, the multi interfaces
   of mobile node attach to network sequentially and flows are moved
   with a prefix granularity. It means that the flows are moved by
   moving prefixes among the different D-MAGs the mobile node is
   attached to. This use case also extends one scenario of [draft-ietf-
   netext-pmipv6-flowmob]. In this case, mobile node obtains a
   combination of prefix(es) in use and a new prefix(es). Basic
   operation will be as follows:

   o As shown in Figure 4, initially the mobile node connects to the
      D-MAG1 using if1 but if2 is not activated yet. When mobile node
      adds traffic flows which use a different service, each flow are
      assigned the different sets of prefixes. Since that, the D-MAG1
      can perform mobility routing only for specific flow when D-MAG2
      requests. After the mobile node turns on if2 and attaches to the
      D-MAG2, the D-MAG2 sends a PBU message to the D-MAG1 and the D-
      MAG1 determines what flow should be moved (using network policy,
      etc.). Since the flow moves with a finer granularity, the
      operation may complete from the D-MAG1 by making a tunnel and
      sending a PBA message included the prefix of selected flow (flow
      x in figure 4.).

4. Use case analysis

   In previous chapter, we describe three use cases of flow mobility in
   the PMIPv6-based DMM environment. Since these use cases attempts to
   extend simply existing flow mobility scheme of centralized mobility
   protocols to the distributed architecture, there are several
   limitations and unclear points. We will discuss about solutions to
   overcome limitations if we apply the flow mobility into the network-
   based DMM architecture.

     4.1. Sharing information between distributed anchors

   In the PMIPv6, LMA which is a centralized anchor could manage all
   network entities and also all MAGs know location and address of LMA.
   Therefore, the MAGs can send the PBU packets immediately after
   detecting the access of the mobile node. However, in the distributed
   architecture, the D-MAGs have all functions of LMA and MAG in PMIPv6
   and manage their network separately. For this reason,  a method used
   to exchange information among D-MAGs is required. In this document,
   we describe several possible solutions.

   First, a new signaling message between D-MAGs that shares the
   address or policy can solve this problem.

   Another solution is that a centralized database gathers information
   of D-MAGs (e.g., attached device, traffic flows, etc.), so the D-
   MAGs access to the database when a mobile node attach to. In [draft-
   seite-dmm-dma], they already proposed a centralized database to
   share information between distributed access routers. Since
   centralized database performs only for sharing information, no data
   traffic from mobile node forwards to this database.

   The last solution is that mobile node sends a trigger message to
   request flow mobility. In this case, the trigger message may include
   the address of D-MAG which will send packets to another the D-MAG,
   flow information or another additional function. The trigger message
   may be defined on the Layer 3, and also be defined on the Layer 2.
   In previous works, the Handoff Indicator (HI) for fast handover can
   be used to trigger message for flow mobility. However, the trigger
   message from mobile node is not appropriate for network-based
   mobility because a mobile node makes signaling messages.

     4.2. Mobile node moves physically with multiple interfaces

   We assumed that the mobile node moves flow between their physical
   interfaces without the physical movement of mobile node. However, in
   the real environment, the mobile node can move physically, so we
   should consider that interfaces perform physical handoff operation.


Sun, et al.            Expires April 21, 2014                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft        use-case-analysis-flowmob-dmm        October 2013

   When a mobile node moves physically in the DMM domain, each physical
   interface of the mobile node detaches and attaches to different D-
   MAGs supporting its access technologies. Traffic flows may move
   through tunnel between the previous D-MAG and the new D-MAG. As a
   result, the mobile node using multi-interfaces has two mobility
   anchors and two tunnels, and four D-MAGs related with one mobile
   node. It means a lot of network resources are needed to support
   multi-interface devices.

5. Considering Control/Data Separation

   For the implementation of distributed and dynamic mobility
   management solution, it could be considered to separate control and
   data plane by extending the centralized database mentioned in 4.1.
   In that case, beside centralized management functions, the database
   also has policies of network management policies and route
   decisions, so it can make decision and trigger to move the specific
   flows. Actually it is not fully distributed architecture but data
   can be distributed and forwarded without signaling messages between
   D-MAGs. [Paper-Chan] and several researches are proposed
   control/data separation schemes based on PMIPv6.

   In particular, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has been proposed
   from [Paper-SDN] to simplify routing entities in the network. In
   that architecture, the centralized control function knows network
   topology, so when a device attaches to the network and sends data,
   the control function catches the packets, makes a path and pushes
   flow rules to routing entities (e.g. switch, router). Routing
   entities in that network just forward packets by the rules from the
   centralized control function. Although the SDN is not fully
   distributed architecture, it can achieve several requirements of
   DMM. SDN-based mobility management is expected to be a promising
   approach which will support mobility management for only moving user
   and session connectivity continuity for mobile users without the
   waste of network resources (e.g. tunneling). Moreover, by using SDN
   concept, we can adjust network policies easily for users and
   specific flows.
