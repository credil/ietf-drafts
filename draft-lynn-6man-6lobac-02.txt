Internet-Draft               IPv6 over MS/TP                October 2011


1.  Introduction

   MS/TP (Master-Slave/Token-Passing) is a contention-free access method
   for the [TIA-485-A] physical layer that is used extensively in
   building automation networks.  This document describes the frame
   format for transmission of IPv6 [RFC2460] packets and the method of
   forming link-local and statelessly autoconfigured IPv6 addresses on
   MS/TP networks.  The general approach is to adapt elements of the
   6LoWPAN [RFC4944] specification to constrained wired networks.

   An MS/TP device is typically based on a low-cost microcontroller with
   limited processing power and memory.  Together with low data rates
   and a small address space, these constraints are similar to those
   faced in 6LoWPAN networks and suggest some elements of that solution
   might be applied.  MS/TP differs significantly from 6LoWPAN in at
   least three respects: a) MS/TP devices typically have a continuous
   source of power, b) all MS/TP devices on a segment can communicate
   directly so there are no hidden node or mesh routing issues, and c)
   proposed changes to MS/TP will support payloads of up to 1500 octets,
   eliminating the need for link-layer fragmentation and reassembly.

   The following sections provide a brief overview of MS/TP, then
   describe how to form IPv6 addresses and encapsulate IPv6 packets in
   MS/TP frames.  This document also specifies a header compression
   mechanism, based on [RFC6282], that is recommended in order to make
   IPv6 practical on low speed MS/TP networks.

1.3.  MS/TP Overview

   This section provides a brief overview of MS/TP, which is specified
   in Clause 9 of ANSI/ASHRAE 135-2010 [BACnet] and included herein by
   reference.  [BACnet] also covers physical layer deployment options.

   MS/TP is designed to enable multidrop networks over shielded twisted
   pair wiring.  It can support segments up to 1200 meters in length or
   data rates up to 115,200 baud (at this highest data rate the segment
   length is limited to 1000 meters).  An MS/TP link requires only a
   UART, a 5ms resolution timer, and a [TIA-485-A] transceiver with a
   driver that can be disabled.  These features combine to make MS/TP a
   cost-effective field bus for the most numerous and least expensive
   devices in a building automation network.

   The differential signaling used by [TIA-485-A] requires a contention-
   free MAC.  MS/TP uses a token to control access to a multidrop bus.
   A master node may initiate the transmission of a data frame when it
   holds the token.  After sending at most a configured maximum number
   of data frames, a master node passes the token to the next master
   node (as determined by node address).  Slave nodes transmit only when
   polled and are not considered part of this specification.

   MS/TP frames have the following format*:

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   *Note: BACnet [Addendum_an], now in public review, assigns a new
    Frame Type for IPv6, extends the maximum length of the Data field to
    1500 octets, and specifies a 32-bit Extended Data CRC.  The Data and
    Extended Data CRC fields are present only if Length is non-zero.

   The MS/TP frame fields have the following descriptions**:

    Preamble             two octet preamble: 0x55, 0xFF
    Frame Type           one octet
    Destination Address  one octet address
    Source Address       one octet address
    Length               two octets, most significant octet first
    Header CRC           one octet
    Data                 0 - 1500 octets**
                         (present only if Length is non-zero)
    Extended Data CRC    four octets**, least significant octet first
                         (present only if Length is non-zero)
    (pad)                (optional) at most one octet of trailer: 0xFF


  The Frame Type is used to distinguish between different types of MAC
  frames.  Currently defined types (in decimal) are:

    00  Token
    01  Poll For Master
    02  Reply To Poll For Master
        ...
    10  IPv6 over MS/TP Encapsulation**

  **See previous note regarding the BACnet [Addendum_an] change proposal
    to support IPv6 over MS/TP Encapsulation.

   Frame Types 11 through 127 are reserved for assignment by ASHRAE.
   All master nodes MUST understand Token, Poll For Master, and Reply to
   Poll For Master frames.  See Section 2 for additional details.

   The Destination and Source Addresses are each one octet in length.
   See Section 3 for additional details.

   The Length field specifies the length of the Data field in octets and
   is transmitted most significant octet first.  See Section 4 for
   additional details.

   The Header CRC field covers the Frame Type, Destination Address,
   Source Address, and Length fields.  The Header CRC generation and
   check procedures are specified in [BACnet].

   The Data and Extended Data CRC fields are conditional on the Frame
   Type and the Length.  (Note: The Data and Extended Data CRC fields
   will always be present in frames specified by this document.)  The
   Extended Data CRC generation and check procedures are specified in
   the BACnet [Addendum_an] change proposal.

1.4.  Goals and Non-goals

   The primary goal of this specification is to enable IPv6 directly to
   wired end devices in building automation and control networks, while
   leveraging existing standards to the greatest extent possible.  A
   secondary goal is to co-exist with legacy MS/TP implementations.
   Only the minimum changes necessary to support IPv6 over MS/TP are
   proposed in BACnet [Addendum_an] (see note in Section 1.3).

   Non-goals include making changes to the MS/TP frame header format,
   control frames, Master Node state machine, or addressing modes.
   Also, while the techniques described here may be applicable to other
   data links, no attempt is made to define a general design pattern.


2.  MS/TP Mode for IPv6

   The BACnet [Addendum_an] change proposal allocates a new MS/TP Frame
   Type from the ASHRAE reserved range to indicate IPv6 encapsulation.
   The new Frame Type for IPv6 over MS/TP Encapsulation is 10 (0x0A).

   All MS/TP master nodes (including those that support IPv6) must
   understand Token, Poll For Master, and Reply to Poll For Master
   control frames and support the Master Node state machine as specified
   in [BACnet].  MS/TP master nodes that support IPv6 must also support
   the Receive Frame state machine as specified in [BACnet] and extended
   by [Addendum_an].


3.  Addressing Modes

   MS/TP node (link-layer) addresses are one octet in length.  The
   method of assigning node addresses is outside the scope of this
   document.  However, each MS/TP node on the link MUST have a unique
   address or a misconfiguration condition exists.

   [BACnet] specifies that addresses 0 through 127 are valid for master
   nodes.  The method specified in Section 6 for creating the Interface
   Identifier (IID) ensures that an IID of all zeros can never result.

   A Destination Address of 255 (0xFF) denotes a link-level broadcast
   (all nodes).  A Source Address of 255 MUST NOT be used.  MS/TP does
   not support multicast, therefore all IPv6 multicast packets MUST be
   sent as link-level broadcasts and filtered at the IPv6 layer.

   This document assumes that each MS/TP link maps to a unique IPv6
   subnet prefix.  Hosts learn IPv6 prefixes via router advertisements
   according to [RFC4861].

4.  Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)

   The BACnet [Addendum_an] change proposal specifies that the MSDU be
   increased to 1500 octets and covered by a 32-bit CRC.  This is
   sufficient to convey an MTU of at least 1280 octets as required by
   IPv6 without the need for link-layer fragmentation and reassembly.

   However, the relatively low data rates of MS/TP still make a
   compelling case for header compression.  An adaptation layer to
   indicate compressed or uncompressed IPv6 headers is specified below
   in Section 5 and the compression scheme is specified in Section 10.


5.  LoBAC Adaptation Layer

   The encapsulation formats defined in this section (subsequently
   referred to as the "LoBAC" encapsulation) comprise the payload (MSDU)
   of an MS/TP frame.  The LoBAC payload (e.g., an IPv6 packet) follows
   an encapsulation header stack.  LoBAC is a subset of the LoWPAN
   encapsulation defined in [RFC4944], therefore the use of "LOWPAN" in
   literals below is intentional.  The primary differences between LoBAC
   and LoWPAN are: a) exclusion of the Fragmentation, Mesh, and
   Broadcast headers, and b) use of LOWPAN_IPHC [RFC6282] in place of
   LOWPAN_HC1 header compression (which is deprecated by [RFC6282]).

   All LoBAC encapsulated datagrams transmitted over MS/TP are prefixed
   by an encapsulation header stack.  Each header in the stack consists
   of a header type followed by zero or more header fields.  Whereas in
   an IPv6 header the stack would contain, in the following order,
   addressing, hop-by-hop options, routing, fragmentation, destination
   options, and finally payload [RFC2460]; in a LoBAC encapsulation the
   analogous sequence is (optional) header compression and payload.  The
   header stacks that are valid in a LoBAC network are shown below.

      A LoBAC encapsulated IPv6 datagram:

        +---------------+-------------+---------+
        | IPv6 Dispatch | IPv6 Header | Payload |
        +---------------+-------------+---------+

      A LoBAC encapsulated LOWPAN_IPHC compressed IPv6 datagram:

        +---------------+-------------+---------+
        | IPHC Dispatch | IPHC Header | Payload |
        +---------------+-------------+---------+

   All protocol datagrams (e.g., IPv6 or compressed IPv6 headers) SHALL
   be preceded by one of the valid LoBAC encapsulation headers.  This

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over MS/TP                October 2011


   permits uniform software treatment of datagrams without regard to
   their mode of transmission.

   The definition of LoBAC headers consists of the dispatch value, the
   definition of the header fields that follow, and their ordering
   constraints relative to all other headers.  Although the header stack
   structure provides a mechanism to address future demands on the LoBAC
   (LoWPAN) adaptation layer, it is not intended to provided general
   purpose extensibility.  This format document specifies a small set of
   header types using the header stack for clarity, compactness, and
   orthogonality.

5.1.  Dispatch Type and Header

   A LoBAC Dispatch type begins with a "0" bit followed by a "1" bit.
   The Dispatch type and header are shown here:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |0|1| Dispatch  |  Type-specific header
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Dispatch               6-bit selector.  Identifies the type of header
                          immediately following the Dispatch Header.

   Type-specific header   A header determined by the Dispatch Header.

                    Figure 2: Dispatch Type and Header


   The Dispatch value may be treated as an unstructured namespace.  Only
   a few symbols are required to represent current LoBAC functionality.
   Although some additional savings could be achieved by encoding
   additional functionality into the dispatch octet, these measures
   would tend to constrain the ability to address future alternatives.

      Pattern      Header Type
    +------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    | 00  xxxxxx | NALP        - Not a LoWPAN (LoBAC) frame            |
    | 01  000000 | ESC         - Additional Dispatch octet follows     |
    | 01  000001 | IPv6        - Uncompressed IPv6 Addresses           |
    |   ...      | reserved    - Defined or reserved by [RFC4944]      |
    | 01  1xxxxx | LOWPAN_IPHC - LOWPAN_IPHC compressed IPv6 [RFC6282] |
    | 1x  xxxxxx | reserved    - Defined or reserved by [RFC4944]      |

   NALP:  Specifies that the following bits are not a part of the LoBAC
      encapsulation, and any LoBAC node that encounters a Dispatch
      value of 00xxxxxx shall discard the packet.  Non-LoBAC protocols
      that wish to coexist with LoBAC nodes should include an octet
      matching this pattern immediately following the MS/TP header.

   ESC:  Specifies that the following header is a single 8-bit field for
      the Dispatch value.  It allows support for Dispatch values larger
      than 127 (see [RFC6282] section 5).

   IPv6:  Specifies that the following header is an uncompressed IPv6
      header [RFC2460].

   LOWPAN_IPHC:  A value of 011xxxxx specifies a LOWPAN_IPHC compression
      header (see Section 10.)

   Reserved: A LoBAC node that encounters a Dispatch value in the range
      01000010 through 01011111 or 1xxxxxxx SHALL discard the packet.


6.  Stateless Address Autoconfiguration

   This section defines how to obtain an IPv6 Interface Identifier.  The
   general procedure is described in Appendix A of [RFC4291], "Creating
   Modified EUI-64 Format Interface Identifiers".

   The Interface Identifier may be based on an [EUI-64] identifier
   assigned to the device (but this is not typical for MS/TP).  In this
   case, the Interface Identifier is formed from the EUI-64 by inverting
   the "u" (universal/local) bit according to [RFC4291].  This will
   result in a globally unique Interface Identifier.

   If the device does not have an EUI-64, then the Interface Identifier
   MUST be formed by concatenating its 8-bit MS/TP node address to the
   seven octets 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xFE, 0x00, 0x00.  For example,
   an MS/TP node address of hexadecimal value 0x4F results in the
   following Interface Identifier:

   |0              1|1              3|3              4|4              6|
   |0              5|6              1|2              7|8              3|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |0000000000000000|0000000011111111|1111111000000000|0000000001001111|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

   Note that this results in the universal/local bit set to "0" to
   indicate local scope.

   of an MS/TP interface MUST have a length of 64 bits.


7.  IPv6 Link Local Address

   The IPv6 link-local address [RFC4291] for an MS/TP interface is
   formed by appending the Interface Identifier, as defined above, to
   the prefix FE80::/64.

8.  Unicast Address Mapping

   The address resolution procedure for mapping IPv6 non-multicast
   addresses into MS/TP link-layer addresses follows the general
   description in Section 7.2 of [RFC4861], unless otherwise specified.

   The Source/Target Link-layer Address option has the following form
   when the addresses are 8-bit MS/TP node (link-layer) addresses.

                      0                   1
                      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                     |     Type      |    Length=1   |
                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                     |     0x00      | MS/TP Address |
                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                     |                               |
                     +-         Padding             -+
                     |         (all zeros)           |
                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Option fields:

   Type:

     1: for Source Link-layer address.

     2: for Target Link-layer address.

   Length:  This is the length of this option (including the type and
     length fields) in units of 8 octets.  The value of this field is 1
     for 8-bit MS/TP node addresses.

   MS/TP Address:  The 8-bit address in canonical bit order [RFC2469].
     This is the unicast address the interface currently responds to.


9.  Multicast Address Mapping

   All IPv6 multicast packets MUST be sent to MS/TP Destination Address
   255 (broadcast) and filtered at the IPv6 layer.  When represented as
   a 16-bit address in a compressed header (see Section 10), it MUST be
   formed by padding on the left with a zero:

                      0                   1
                      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                     |     0x00      |     0xFF      |
                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+---------------+


10.  Header Compression

   LoBAC uses LOWPAN_IPHC IPv6 compression, which is specified in
   [RFC6282] and included herein by reference.  This section will simply
   identify substitutions that should be made when interpreting the text
   of [RFC6282].

   In general the following substitutions should be made:

   *  Replace "6LoWPAN" with "MS/TP network"

   *  Replace "IEEE 802.15.4 address" with "MS/TP address"

   When a 16-bit address is called for (i.e., an IEEE 802.15.4 "short
   address") it MUST be formed by padding the MS/TP address to the left
   with a zero:

                      0                   1
                      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                     |     0x00      | MS/TP address |
                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+---------------+


11.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses values previously reserved by [RFC4944] and
   [RFC6282] and makes no further requests of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed upon publication.

12.  Security Considerations

   The method of deriving Interface Identifiers from MAC addresses is
   intended to preserve global uniqueness when possible.  However, there
   is no protection from duplication through accident or forgery.
