Internet-Draft   IMAP Access to IETF Email List Archives        Feb 2012


1.  Introduction

   The IETF makes heavy use of email lists to conduct its work.  This
   often involves accessing the archived history of those email lists.
   Work is underway to improve the web-based browsing and searching of
   these archives [I-D.sparks-genarea-mailarch].  Participants would
   like to have the ability to browse and search those archives using
   standard IMAP clients.  This memo captures the requirements for
   providing a service that would allow such browsing and searching.

   Discussion of this memo should take place on the ietf@ietf.org
   mailing list.


2.  Requirements for IMAP access to archived IETF lists

   Many participants would prefer to access the list archives using IMAP
   [RFC3501].  Providing this access while meeting the following
   requirements will likely require an IMAP server with specialized
   capabilities.

   o  The system should expose the archive using an IMAP interface, with
      each list represented as a mailbox.

   o  This interface must work with standard IMAP clients.

   o  The interface should allow users to each have their own read/
      unread marks for messages.  Allowing other annotation is
      desirable.

      -  If this requires the user to login, the system should use
         datatracker login credentials

   o  The interface must have server-side searching enabled, and should
      support multiple simultaneous extensive searches.  The server
      should facilitate the enhanced search capabilities described in
      [I-D.sparks-genarea-mailarch]


3.  Security Considerations

   Allowing IMAP as an interface for browsing and searching the archives
   of IETF email lists does not affect the security of the Internet in
   any significant fashion.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.


5.  Acknowledgements

   This text was derived directly from an earlier version of
   [I-D.sparks-genarea-mailarch] which incorporated text suggestions
   from Alexey Melnikov, Pete Resnick, and S. Moonesamy.


6.  Changelog

6.1.  00

   1.  Split this set of requirements out from the mailarch doc so that
       this project could be pursued separately
