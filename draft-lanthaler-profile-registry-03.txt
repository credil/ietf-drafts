Internet-Draft            Profile URI Registry            September 2013


1.  Introduction

   Profiles, as defined by [RFC6906], can be used to signal support for
   additional semantics, such as constraints, conventions, extensions,
   or any other aspects that do not alter the basic media type
   semantics.  Profiles are identified by a URI and can thus be created
   without central coordination.

   Similarly to media types and link relation types it is, in some
   cases, beneficial to centrally manage profile URIs to ensure
   interoperability and decrease the coupling between clients and
   servers.  This allows the independent evolution of clients and
   servers as both are coupled to these central contracts instead of
   being coupled to each other.  Therefore, this document establishes an
   IANA registry for profile URIs.


2.  Registration Process

   All elements in this registry require a URI in order to be
   registered.  The meaning of the profile URI must be documented in a
   permanent and readily available public specification in sufficient
   detail so that interoperability between independent implementations
   is possible ("Specification Required" per [RFC5226]).

   An exemplary registration request can be found in Section 3.


3.  Example Registration Request

   The following is an example registration request for the profile URI
   http://example.com/profiles/example.


   This is a request to IANA to please register the profile URI
   "http://example.com/profiles/example" in the Profile URI Registry
   according [this document].

   o  Profile URI: http://example.com/profiles/example

   o  Common Name: Exemplary Profile URI

   o  Description: An exemplary profile URI registration.

   o  Specification Document: [this document]

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document establishes the Profile URI registry.  The registration
   procedure for new entries requires a request in the form of the
   following template and is "Specification Required" per [RFC5226].
   Instructions for a registrant to request the registration of a
   profile URI are in Section 2.

   The underlying registry data (e.g., the XML file) must include
   Simplified BSD License text as described in Section 4.e of the Trust
   Legal Provisions (<http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info>).

   The registration template is:

   o  Profile URI: The URI that identifies the registered profile.

   o  Common Name: The name by which the profile being registered is
      generally known.

   o  Description: A short description of the profile

   o  Specification Document: Reference to the document that specifies
      the URI, preferably including a URI that can be used to retrieve a
      copy of the document.  An indication of the relevant sections may
      also be included but is not required.

   o  Notes: [optional]

4.1.  Initial Registry Contents

   The Profile URI registry's initial contents are:

   o  Profile URI: urn:example:profile-uri
   o  Common Name: Exemplary Profile
   o  Description: A profile to be used in examples.
   o  Specification Document: [this document]

   o  Profile URI: http://dublincore.org/documents/2008/08/04/dc-html/
   o  Common Name: Dublin Core HTML meta data profile
   o  Description: A set of conventions by which a Dublin Core metadata
      description set can be can be represented within an (X)HTML Web
      page using (X)HTML elements and attributes.
   o  Specification Document: [DC-HTML]

   o  Profile URI: http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#expanded
   o  Common Name: Expanded JSON-LD
   o  Description: A profile URI to request or signal expanded JSON-LD
      document form.
   o  Specification Document: [W3C.CR-json-ld-20130910]

   o  Profile URI: http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#compacted
   o  Common Name: Compacted JSON-LD
   o  Description: A profile URI to request or signal compacted JSON-LD
      document form.
   o  Specification Document: [W3C.CR-json-ld-20130910]

   o  Profile URI: http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#flattened
   o  Common Name: Flattened JSON-LD
   o  Description: A profile URI to request or signal flattened JSON-LD
      document form.
   o  Specification Document: [W3C.CR-json-ld-20130910]


5.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations beyond those already
   inherent to using URIs.  Security considerations for URIs in general
   can be found in [RFC3986].


6.  Change Log

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.

6.1.  From -02 to -03

   o  Seed registry with the profile URIs defined in [DC-HTML] and
      [W3C.CR-json-ld-20130910].

6.2.  From -01 to -02

   o  Do not establish a new IETF URN Sub-namespace anymore.

6.3.  From -00 to -01

   o  Use HTTP URI instead of URN in example registration request to
      make it clearer that not only URNs can be registered.

   o  Move security considerations to the end.
