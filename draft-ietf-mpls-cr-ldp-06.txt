This document specifies mechanisms and TLVs (Type/Length/Value) for
support of CR-LSPs (constraint-based routed Label Switched Path)
using LDP (Label Distribution Protocol).

This specification proposes an end-to-end setup mechanism of a CR-LSP
initiated by the ingress LSR (Label Switching Router).  We also
specify mechanisms to provide means for reservation of resources
using LDP.

This document is a product of the Multiprotocol Label Switching
Working Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
