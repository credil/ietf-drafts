	    <section title="Introduction">
	       <t>
	          The Session Description Protocol (SDP) <xref target="RFC4566"/> 
	          is the subject of numerous specifications that have been produced by the IETF.  
	          It can be difficult to locate the right document, 
	          or even to determine the set of Request for Comments (RFC) about SDP.          
	       </t>
	       <t>
	          This specification serves as a guide to the SDP RFC series.  
	          It is a current snapshot of the specifications under the SDP umbrella at the time of publication.  
	          It is anticipated that this document itself will be regularly updated as SDP specifications mature.  
	          Furthermore, it references many specifications, which, 
	          at the time of publication of this document, 
	          were not yet finalised, 
	          and may eventually be completed or abandoned.  
	          Therefore, the enumeration of specifications here is a work-in-progress and subject to change.
	      </t>
	      <t>
	         For each specification, 
	         a paragraph or so description is included that summarises the purpose of the specification.
	         Each specification also includes a letter that designates its category in the Standards Track <xref target="RFC2026"/>.  
	         These values are:
	         <list>
	           <t>S: Standards Track (Proposed Standard, Draft Standard, or Standard)</t>
	           <t>E: Experimental</t>
	           <t>B: Best Current Practice</t>
	           <t>I: Informational</t>
	         </list>
	      </t>
	      <t>
	         The specifications are grouped together by topic.  The topics are:
	         <list style="hanging">
	         
	            <t hangText="Core:">
	               The SDP specifications that are expected to be utilised for
	               each session or registration an endpoint participates in.
	            </t>
	
	            <t hangText="General Purpose Infrastructure:">
	               General purpose extensions to SDP, 
	               but the ones that are not expected to always be used.

	            <t hangText="NAT Traversal:">
	               Specifications to deal with firewall and NAT traversal.

	            <t hangText="Quality of Service:">
	               Specifications related to multimedia quality of service (QoS).
	            </t>
	
	            <t hangText="Operations and Management:">
	               Specifications related to configuration
	               and monitoring of SDP deployments.
	            </t>
	
	            <t hangText="Minor Extensions:">
	               Specifications that solve a narrow problem space or provide an optimisation.
	            </t>
	
	            <t hangText="Security Mechanisms:">
	               Specifications providing security functionality for SDP.

	              Specifications for multimedia conferencing.
	            </t>
	
	         </list>
	      </t>
	      <t>
	         Typically, SDP extensions fit naturally into topic areas, and
	         implementors interested in a particular topic often implement many or
	         all of the specifications in that area.  There are some
	         specifications that fall into multiple topic areas, 
	         but generally they will be listed only once.
	      </t>
	      <t>
	         This document itself is not an update to <xref target="RFC4566"/> or an extension to SDP.  
	         It is an informational document, meant to guide newcomers, implementers, 
	         and deployers to the many specifications associated with SDP.

							<xref target="RFC4474"/> defines a mechanism for providing a cryptographically
							verifiable identity of the calling party in a SIP request. Known
							as "SIP Identity", 
							this mechanism provides an alternative to <xref target="RFC3325"/>. 
							It has seen little deployment so far, but its importance as
							a key construct for anti-spam techniques and new security

							Connected Identity in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
							(S): 
							<xref target="RFC4916"/> formally updates <xref target="RFC3261"/>. 
							It defines an extension
							to SIP that allows a calling user to determine the identity of the final called user (connected party). 
							Due to forwarding and
							retargeting services, this may not be the same as the user that
							the caller was originally trying to reach. The mechanism works in
							tandem with the SIP identity specification <xref target="RFC4474"/> to provide
							signatures over the connected party identity. It can also be used
							if a party identity changes mid call due to third party call
							control actions or PSTN behavior.
