Internet-Draft    Global Table Multicast with BGP-MVPN     February 2013


1.  Introduction

   [RFC6513] and [RFC6514] specify procedures and encodings to implement
   Multicast for L3VPNs (MVPN).  [RFC6513] specifies general concepts
   and procedures that apply to PIM-based and/or BGP-based C-Multicast
   State Signaling (referred to PIM-MVPN and BGP-MVPN respectively), and
   [RFC6514] specifies BGP procedures and encodings used by both PIM-
   MVPN and BGP-MVPN.

   While [RFC6513] and [RFC6514] assume the context of VPN, they can be
   used to implement Global (vs. VRF) Table Multicast as well, without
   any protocol modification/extension, even though the RFCs do not
   explicitly mention it.

   Consider a provider network where the "core" part of it uses MPLS
   P2MP LSPs or Ingress Replication over either P2P LSPs (with RSVP-TE)
   or MP2P LSPs (with LDP) instead of PIM to carry multicast traffic
   among the border routers (BRs) of the core.  Those BRs run PIM on
   interfaces connected to other routers outside the core.

   This document describes how Global Table Multicast can be implemented
   using BGP-MVPN procedures.  We start with a simple reference scenario
   below, and also discuss one slightly different scenario and another
   special one.

   With Global Table Multicast implemented by BGP-MVPN procedures, all
   the features/characteristics of BGP-MVPN apply, including scaling,
   aggregation, flexible choice of provider tunnels, support for PIM-DM/
   ASM/SSM/Bidir as PE-CE multicast protocol, BSR and AUTO-RP as RP-to-
   group mapping protocols, etc.

3.  Operation

   In the simplest reference scenario, the BRs advertise to each other
   RPF routes to multicast sources via iBGP (with or without RRs in the
   middle) with Next Hop set to themselves.  The routes could have been
   learned from other non-BRs via eBGP or IGP.

   Conceptually and functionally, those BRs are just like MVPN PEs:
   connections to other routers outside the core can be treated as PE-CE
   interfaces and MVPN procedures can run among the PEs (i.e., BRs) for
   Discovery, Tunnel Binding, and Multicast State Signaling.

   With that, using BGP-MVPN procedures for Global Table Multicast is
   straightforward and requires almost no further clarification.
   However, some popular practices are described below.

   By default, RD 0:0 is used when advertising A-D routes for Global
   Table Multicast, though an implementation MAY support the
   configuration and use of a different RD value.

   Similarly, when constructing the C-multicast Import RT as specified
   in Section 7 of [RFC6514], it is RECOMMENDED that the Local
   Administrator field is set to 0, though an implementation MAY use any
   value that can uniquely associate it to the global routing table (vs.
   a VRF).

3.1.  IBGP session between BRs and non-BRs

   In the simple reference scenario above, it is assumed that the BRs
   learn RPF routes from non-BRs via eBGP or IGP.  The assumption is to
   illustrate the analogy to a true VPN environment.  In another
   deployment scenario, the BRs could have learned the RPF routes over
   those iBGP sessions to non-BRs.  If the BRs act as RRs and reflect
   the RPF routes to other BRs with polices to attach VRF Route Import
   Extended Community and Source AS Extended Community, BGP-MVPN
   procedures can still be used as described earlier.  Even if the BRs
   do not act as RRs, the scenario could be considered analogous to what
   [RFC6368] describes.  As long as BRs re-advertise those RPF routes
   with the above mentioned communities, BGP-MVPN procedures can be used
   as described earlier.  Note that they do not even need to use the
   push/pop procedures in [RFC6368] - the only requirement is for the
   BRs to re-advertise the routes learned over iBGP sessions from non-
   BRs to other BRs over iBGP sessions.

3.2.  Non-BGP RPF Routes or BGP RPF routes not originated by the BRs

   With true MVPN, the PEs advertise the RPF routes themselves as VPN-IP
   routes, and attach a VRF Route Import Extended Community that has the

   C-multicast Import RT value for the VRF associated with the routes.
   The VRF Route Import Extended Community is extracted by egress PEs
   and attached to their C-Multicast Routes as Route Target Extended
   Community to control the distribution to and importation by relevant
   ingress PEs.

   With Global Table Multicast, in both the simple reference scenario
   and the above mentioned variance, the BRs do (re-)advertise the RPF
   routes as required for BGP-MVPN.  However, in other situations, it is
   possible that the RPF routes are not advertised by the BRs via BGP at
   all, hence they may not carry the VRF Route Import Extended
   Community.

   Consider the following example:

      |---- Site 1 -------|

                EBGP
      src--CPE1-----GW1/CE1 -------BR1/PE1
                        \         /|
                        |\       / |
                        | \IBGP /  |
                        |  \   /   |
                        |   \ /    |
                        |    X     |
                        |   / \    |
                        |  /   \   |
                        | /     \  |
                        |/       \ |
                        /         \|
      rcv--CPE2-----GW2/CE2 -------BR2/PE2
                EBGP         IBGP

      |---- Site 2 -------|


   There is a full-mesh of IBGP sessions among provider routers GW1/BR1/
   BR2/GW2.  EBGP sessions run between CPE1/GW1 and between CPE2/GW2.
   Border routers BR1/BR2 run BGP-MVPN procedures for Global Table
   Multicast.  GW1 learns of BGP route to the src from CPE1 and
   advertises it to BRx/GW2.

   Because GW1 does not run MVPN, BR2's route to the src (learned from
   GW1 instead of BR1) does not have the VRF Route Import Extended
   Community.  Therefore, it would not be able to correctly attach a
   Route Target Extended Community corresponding to BR1 in its
   C-Multicast Routes.

   To handle that situation, BR2 performs the following recursively.
   Note that the route in the following procedure is either the RPF
   route for the source itself, or the route to the Next Hop of the BGP
   route in the previous recursion.

   o  If the route is a BGP route with a VRF Route Import Extended
      Community, that VRF Route Import Extended Community is used.

   o  If the route is a BGP route without a VRF Route Import Extended
      Community, get the route to the Next Hop and recurse.

   o  If the route is an IGP route with a RSVP-TE LSP as next hop, and
      the LSP endpoint is a BR that advertises an Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D
      route (BR1 in the above example), a VRF Route Import Extended
      Community is constructed as BR_addr:0 to be associated with the
      RPF route, where the BR_addr is the Originating Router's IP
      Address of the Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D route.

   If the above procedure does not produce a usable VRF Route Import
   Extended Community, then the RPF route is considered a local route
   (vs. a remote route that is associated with a remote BR).  Note that
   the special process is necessary only if the BRs (that run MVPN
   procedures) do not advertise the RPF routes via BGP and include VRF
   Route Import Extended Community in such routes.

   Constructing the VRF Route Import as BR_addr:0 by an egress BR in the
   above special situation explains why it is RECOMMENDED that the Local
   Administrator is set to 0 when an ingress BR constructs its
   C-Multicast Import RT - the zero value is a special value agreed on
   apriori by all (vs. a local value that is normally picked by the
   ingress router and signaled via the VRF Route Import Extended
   Community).
