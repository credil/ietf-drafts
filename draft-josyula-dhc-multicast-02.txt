Abstract

   Internet Protocol Television(IPTV) is a system facilitating
   transmission of television channels as multicast streams use
   dedicated multicast group addresses in IP networks.  Internet Group
   Multicast Protocol(IGMP) is widely used for the communication between
   hosts and routers to deliver the multicast streams in the IPv4
   networks.  Similarly,Multicast Listener Discovery Protocol (MLD)is
   used for the communication between the hosts and routers to deliver
   the multicast streams in the IPv6 networks.  It is also possible for
   the networks to distinguish these multicast streams not only by their
   destination multicast group but also by the source IP address of the
   streams.  IGMP version-3 and MLD version-2 are protocols that allow
   the hosts to inform the neighboring routers about their desire to
   receive the multicast streams from specific source IP addresses.  
   This needs a mechanism to supply the available multicast source
   address information to the hosts and the hosts also should be
   strictly implemented with the source specific multicasting aware
   protocols such as above mentioned IGMPv3 or MLDv2.  This document
   describes a new DHCP option which can addresses these issues.  In
   addition to this, the document also describes about the advantages in
   the networks by implementing this option.

INTERNET DRAFT    DHCP Option for IPTV Source address   October 03, 2013


1  Introduction

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


1.2  Background

   Many broad band service providers all across the world are delivering
   triple play or multi play solutions.  IPTV Solution is widely
   integrated as part of these solutions.In many cases this service is
   run by delivering multicast streams to the IP hosts/Set top boxes
   connected to the home gateways.  IGMP protocol in IPv4 networks and
   MLD protocol in IPv6 networks are commonly used for requesting these
   multicast streams from the nearest router connected via an access
   network.  Below sections will explain the typical topology and
   functionality in most of the traditional access networks.  The MLD
   protocol follows the same mechanism in IPv6 networks of IGMP in IPv4.
    In-order to reduce the complexity, the rest of the discussion in the
   document is made with reference to IGMP only.  MLD specific issues
   are quoted wherever it is required. Further, wherever IGMP version-3
   is referred, it is implied that can pointed to the MLD version-2 in
   IPv6 networks.

INTERNET DRAFT    DHCP Option for IPTV Source address   October 03, 2013


1.2.2  Network behavior

   When any of the hosts starts(eg.power-on)initially, it will do a DHCP
   discover/request to get an IP address to interact with the network. 
   DHCP server in the network will assign a unicast IP address to the
   host.  The nearest router will be sending IGMP general query messages
   for every query interval time to check if any of the hosts are
   interested in multicast service.  If the host is interested in
   receipt of a multicast channel, it will send an IGMP membership
   report message towards the router.  The router will forward the
   multicast streams destined to the requested multicast group towards
   the user interface.  When the IGMP version-3 is implemented in the
   network, the user will send the IGMP report message to include or
   exclude particular multicast sources from the network.  Router will
   forward the multicast streams ONLY from the sources requested by the
   user.

1.2.3  Limitations

   For the implementation IGMPv3 or for upgrading the networks to
   IGMPv3, the below additional requirements are to be met by the
   network elements:

   1. The network should build a mechanism that supplies the multicast
   source address information to the hosts.

   2. The hosts should be capable of distinguishing the multicast
   streams based on the source IP address from which they are
   originated.

   3. The hosts should strictly follow IGMP version-3 mechanism for
   exchanging IGMP messages with the network elements.

   The new option described in the below sections can effectively
   address these issues.

2. DHCP IPTV Source Address Option

   The "IPTV Source Address" option specifies a list of IPTV source IP
   addresses available or accessible to the hosts for receiving the
   multicast streams.  These source IPs can be listed in the option in
   the order of any criteria such as quality of service or specific
   service level agreements (SLAs)etc.

   The minimum length of the option is 4 bytes.

   The length of the option should be in the multiples of 4.

   |                                                               |

   |                     IP Address-2                              |

   |                                                               |

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The minimum length of this option would be 16Bytes and the length of
   the option would be in the multiples of 16.

3  Server and client behavior

   In case of IPv4 networks, the defined "IPTV Source Address option"
   field will be filled by the DHCP server while sending the DHCP
   acknowledgement packet to the client.  Client can also send a DHCP
   inform message to the DHCP server, requesting this parameter.

   Similarly, incase of IPv6 networks, this option can be included in
   the DHCP solicit, advertise, request, renew, rebind, Information-
   request and reply.  The clients can also request this option by
   including this in the Options Request Option(ORO).

INTERNET DRAFT    DHCP Option for IPTV Source address   October 03, 2013


   The server will be pre-configured by the multicast source address
   information by the administrator as per the SLA/policy or any such
   criteria specific to the multicast users.

   The clients will use the source addresses obtained from the server
   while interacting with the routers using IGMPv3 or MLDv2.

   If the hosts are still using older versions of IGMP/MLD protocols
   which are not capable of requesting or distinguishing the multicast
   traffic based on the source IP address, this is also possible that
   the intermediate access nodes can snoop the DHCP messages and keep
   the record of the list of source addresses provided to the host.  By
   using this information, the access nodes can filter the multicast
   streams on behalf of the hosts.  This snooping information can also
   be used to authenticate the users for accessing the multicast service
   from various multicast sources in the network.

4  Advantages

   By addressing the issues mentioned in the section 1.1.3, the
   implementation of this option in the network provides various
   advantages to the network.

   - It provides an effective method for maintaining and updating the   
     multicast source address information to every multicast host in the
     network as per their individual SLAs.

   - Intermediate access nodes can snoop this option from the DHCP      
     messages to extend the its multicast services like :

     - Forwarding the multicast streams only to the authorized users

     - Acting on behalf of the older clients which are non source aware 
       protocol versions (like IGMPv1/v2 and MLDv1) and make them       
       integrated with the latest source specific multicast networks    
       with IGMPv3/MLDv2 implementations.    

   - Convergence of IPTV services from different users can be achieved  
     at the user level irrespective of the multicast transmitting       
     technologies used in the network.For example,any service provider  
     who manages the aggregation and access networks can receive the    
     multicast streams from different sources/networks (may not be under
     their own administration) and feed them to their access networks.  
   - The subscribers can easily validate the quality of the service     
     offered by different IPTV sources dynamically and switch to the    
     interested source as per their own set of requirements.

5  Security Considerations

   All the security considerations mentioned in rfc2131 (Dynamic Host
   Control Protocol) are applicable for this document.If any malpractice
   or mal function in DHCP may effect further transmission of multicast
   traffic in the network.


6  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign the option for multicast source address
   for the registry maintained for DHCP.
