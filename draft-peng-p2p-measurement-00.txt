Internet-Draft             p2p measurement              March 11, 2012


1. Introduction

   With the progress of peer-to-peer (P2P) technology, the Internet
   applications model is in a great reformation. In order to get an all-
   win solution among the Internet users, Internet service providers and
   content providers, it is necessary to measure and analyze the P2P
   applications from their perspectives.

   Measuring and characterizing the properties of p2p networks will
   benefit the optimization, management of the p2p systems. It seems
   infeasible to capture a complete and precise snapshot of p2p overlay
   networks due to the variety of p2p protocols and dynamics of the
   servents. Studying the details of p2p protocols and analyzing the
   specific p2p overlay network instance become an alternative method
   for this goal.

   In this document, the content of P2P measurement is introduced
   firstly, and then the existing research on P2P measurement is
   classified into 3 areas: topology measurement, traffic measurement
   and availability measurement. In each area, it gives the detailed
   objects which are concluded from the current research work.

2. P2p measurement content overview

   The main task of p2p network measurement is to measure the practical
   networks, valuate the operation state of the p2p network and
   establish the network behavior analytical model based on measurements.
   The p2p network measurement can be divided into three types according
   to different content:

   1. p2p topology characteristics measurement: this measurement will
      acquire the overlay topologies for different p2p applications,
      analyze the graph property and dynamic property of the
      corresponding topology.

   2. p2p traffic characteristics measurement: this measurement will
      acquire all kinds of statistical parameters of p2p traffic,
      analyze the space characteristics and time characteristics.

   3. p2p availability characteristics measurement: this measurement
      will measure the availability for p2p node, resource and ect.

3. P2p measurement methods

   According to the different measurement style, the p2p measurement
   methods can be divided into active measurement method and passive
   measurement method.

3.1. Active measurement method

   The active method is to use network crawler to actively join the p2p
   network and then get the related properties of the network and peers.
   Generally, the crawler joins the p2p system just like the ordinary
   peer and then collects the correlative information as much as
   possible which usually includes the IP address and port number of
   peers and all the metadata which can be obtained by p2p protocol.

   The active method is mainly used to measure the topology, delay,
   content availability, peer's microscopic behavior such as
   upload/download in p2p network.

   The biggest shortcoming of this method is lack of generality and we
   must set up sole crawler for each p2p network.

3.2. Passive measurement method

   The passive method is to deploy some measurement points at different
   location interspersed in the network and use the specific software
   and hardware devices to passively monitor the p2p traffic. In order
   to the universality of the measurement data, the measurement location
   is generally at the core router in the backbone network or at the
   edge entrance of one IPS network.

   This method is used to measure the macroscopic properties of p2p
   traffic such as traffic bandwidth of p2p traffic, the number of peers
   and the peer connection lasting time.

   The biggest shortcoming of this method is that it can't deeply
   understand the p2p network behavior though it has good generality and
   can measure many p2p applications.

4. The measurement indexes for p2p network

4.1. p2p topology characteristics measurement

   The p2p system is an application overlay network Constructed over the
   internet and its topology mainly describes the arrangement mode of
   its peers and how the peers connect to each others. The neighbor
   selection policy and peer's join/exit make the p2p application have
   the natural dynamic property which causes great difficulty for large
   scale p2p network topology measurement. However, the current p2p
   topology characteristics measurement includes graph property
   measurement and dynamic property measurement.

4.1.1. Graph property measurement

   The graph property measurement includes four index: the distribution
   of peer connectivity, the distribution of the distance between any
   pair of peers, the small world property and the topology elasticity.

   The distribution of peer connectivity is to study the number of
   connection of one peer, also called in-degree/out-degree.

   The distribution of the distance between any pair of peers is to
   study the shortest path from one peer to any other peer according to
   hops. [Stutzbach2005] shows that 60 percent paths have 4 hops coming
   from four measurements.

   The small world property is to study the cluster degree of p2p
   topology which usually is weighed by clustering coefficient.
   [Stutzbach2005] showes that the Gnutella 0.6 network has this
   property.

   the topology elasticity is to study the connectivity changes after
   deleting some peers.

4.1.2. Dynamic property measurement

   For the peer randomly joins/exits the p2p network, the p2p network
   topology dynamically changes at the all time. So the study for p2p
   network dynamic property is at the starting stage and the current
   measurement includes: the connectivity changes among the stable core
   overlay, the distribution of peer session time, the distribution of
   download time and the association with session time.

   One focus study is to measure churn which is dynamic change caused by
   peer joins/exits p2p network. The common indexes which describe the
   churn include session time, lifetime, availability and etc.

4.2. p2p traffic characteristics measurement

   The p2p traffic characteristics are usually acquired by passively
   monitoring the network packets. Along with the development of the p2p
   traffic concealment technology and the inhomogeneous distribution of
   the peers, how to ensure the accuracy and representativeness of the
   p2p traffic statistical data becomes the most important problem for
   p2p traffic measurement. The p2p traffic characteristics measurement
   includes the space characteristics and time characteristics

4.2.1. space characteristics measurement

   The space characteristics of p2p traffic include two sides: one is
   the distribution on Regional difference from the macroscopic view,
   the other is the heterogeneity between different peer.

4.2.2. time characteristics measurement

   The time characteristics of p2p traffic also include two sides: one
   is activity during time of day from the macroscopic view, the other
   is self-similarity characteristics from the microscopic view.

4.3. p2p availability characteristics measurement

   The p2p network availability describes the degree how the user
   obtains the services. The p2p network availability is not only
   related with the each peer's availability, but also with the
   connectivity state of the whole network and peer's join/exit behavior.
   The p2p availability measurement includes host availability
   measurement and content availability measurement.

4.3.1. host availability measurement

   The host availability in p2p network is expressed by the host active
   time and the ratio of active host. The general method is to randomly
   select a host set under test from the specific p2p network,
   periodically send probe messages and count the number of responses.

4.3.2. content availability measurement

   The content availability describes the difficult degree that the user
   can obtain the target resource for p2p system, that is the difficult
   degree of user querying and downloading resource. The related factors
   which influence the content availability is more complicated than
   those of the host availability, so we only indirectly reflect this
   index through five indexes: the number of reply for a query, the
   query response time, the content stability, the multiplicity of the
   content, download finishing time.

   According the above five indexes, [Christin2005] shows that the
   network topology is closely related with the content availability,
   the multiplicity of the content usually follows the power-law
   distribution.

   For protecting the digital right, some ICPs use the content pollution
   technology in p2p network. The content pollution has important impact

   for the content availability and how to measure the pollution degree
   is under studying.

5. Future work

   The future work is to give some detailed measurement indexes for p2p
   system. If possible, we will give the detailed  indexes for some
   typical and popular p2p system, such as p2p file system, p2p
   streaming system.
