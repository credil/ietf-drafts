Abstract

   The demands on the networking infrastructure are growing
   exponentially; the drivers are bandwidth hungry rich media
   applications, inter data center communications etc. In this context,
   it is important to optimally use the bandwidth in the service
   provider backbone networks which extensively use LAG/ECMP techniques
   for bandwidth scaling. This internet draft describes the issues faced
   in the service provider backbone in the context of LAG/ECMP and
   formulates best practice recommendations for managing the bandwidth
   efficiently in the service provider backbone.

1. Introduction

   Service provider backbone networks extensively use LAG/ECMP
   techniques for bandwidth scaling. Network traffic can be
   predominantly categorized into two traffic types, long-lived large
   flows and short-lived small flows. Hashing techniques, which perform
   an approximate distribution of these flows across the LAG/ECMP
   component links, typically result in a sub-optimal utilization of
   LAG/ECMP component links. Round Robin load-balancing techniques
   address this problem but have the side effect of causing packet re-
   ordering. This internet draft recommends best practices for optimal
   LAG/ECMP component link utilization while using hashing techniques.
   These best practices comprise of the following; first is
   identification of long-lived large flows in routers and next is
   assigning the long-lived large flows to specific LAG/ECMP component
   links.

3. Sub-optimal LAG/ECMP Component Link Utilization in the current framework

   Hashing techniques, which perform an approximate distribution of
   long-lived large flows and short-lived small flows across the
   LAG/ECMP component links, typically results in a sub-optimal
   utilization of LAG/ECMP component links. This is depicted in Figure 1
   with a detailed description below.

     .  There is a LAG between 2 routers R1 and R2. This LAG has 3
        component links (1), (2), (3)

     .  Component link (1) has 2 short-lived small flows and 1 long-
        lived large flow and the link capacity is optimally utilized

     .  Component link (2) has 3 short-lived small flows and no long-
        lived large flow and the link capacity is sub-optimally utilized

          o The absence of any long-lived large flow causes the
             component link under-utilization

     .  Component link (3) has 2 short-lived small flows and 2 long-
        lived large flows and the link capacity is over-utilized.

          o The presence of 2 long-lived large flows causes the
             component link over-utilization

4. Best practices for optimal LAG/ECMP Component Link Utilization

   The suggested techniques in this draft for optimal LAG/ECMP component
   link utilization are meant to put forth a locally_ optimized
   solution, i.e. local in the sense of both measuring and optimizing

   for long-lived large flows at individual nodes in the network. This
   approach would not yield a globally optimal placement of a large,
   long-lived flow across several nodes in the network which some
   networks may desire/require. On the other hand, this may be adequate
   for some operators for the following reasons 1) Different links in
   the network experience different levels of utilization and, thus, a
   more "targeted" solution is needed for those few hot-spots in the
   network 2) Some networks may lack end-to-end visibility.

   The various steps in achieving optimal LAG/ECMP component link
   utilization in backbone networks are detailed below

   Step 1) This involves identifying long-lived large flows in the
   egress processing elements in routers; besides the flow parameters,
   this also involves identifying the egress component link the flow is
   using. The identification of long-lived large flows is explained in
   detail in section 4.1.

   Step 2) The egress component links are periodically scanned for link
   utilization. If the egress component link utilization exceeds a pre-
   programmed threshold, an operator alert is generated. The long-lived
   large flows mapping to the congested egress component link are
   exported to a central management entity. IETF could potentially
   consider a standards-based activity around, say, a data-model used to
   move this information from the router to the central management
   entity.

   Step 3) On receiving the alert about the congested component link,
   the operator, through a central management entity finds out the long-
   lived large flows mapping to the component link and the LAG/ECMP
   group to which the component link maps to.

   Step 4) The operator can choose to rebalance the long-lived large
   flows on lightly loaded component links of the LAG/ECMP group. The
   operator, through a central management entity 1) Can indicate
   specific long-lived large flows to rebalance 2) Let the router decide
   the best long-lived large flows to rebalance. The central management
   entity conveys the above information to the router. IETF could
   potentially consider a standards-based activity around, say, a data-
   model used to move this information from the central management
   entity to the router. The re-balancing of long-lived large flows is
   explained in detail in section 4.2.

4.1. Long-lived Large Flow Identification

   A flow (long-lived large flow or short-lived small flow) can be
   defined using one of the following suggested formats as described
   below

     .  IP 5 tuple: IP Protocol, IP source address, IP destination
        address, TCP/UDP source port, TCP/UDP destination port

     .  IP 3 tuple: IP Protocol,  IP source address, IP destination
        address

     .  MPLS Labels

     .  VXLAN, NVGRE

     .  Other formats

   The best practices described in this document are agnostic to the
   format of the flow.

4.1.1. Sflow/Netflow

   Enable Sflow/Netflow sampling on all the egress ports in the routers.
   Through Sflow processing in a Sflow Collector, an approximate
   indication of large flows mapping to each of the component links in
   each LAG/ECMP group is available. The advantages and disadvantages of
   sFlow/Netflow are detailed below.

   Advantages of Sflow/Netflow

     .  Supported in most routers

     .  Minimal router resources

   Disadvantages of Sflow/Netflow

     .  Approximate identification of long-lived large flows

     .  Non real-time identification of long-lived large flows based on
        historical analysis

   The time taken to determine a candidate long-lived large flow would
   be dependent on the amount of sFlow samples being generated and the
   processing power of the external sFlow collector; this is under
   further study.

4.1.2. Automatic hardware identification

   Implementations may choose to implement automatic identification of
   long-lived large flows in hardware in egress processing elements of
   routers. The characteristics of such an implementation would be

     .  Inline solution

     .  Minimal system resources

     .  Maintain line-rate performance

     .  Perform accounting of long-lived large flows with a high degree
        of accuracy

   Using automatic hardware identification of long-lived large flows, an
   accurate indication of large flows mapping to each of the component
   links in a LAG/ECMP group is available. The advantages and
   disadvantages of automatic hardware identification are detailed
   below.

   Advantages of Automatic Hardware Identification

     .  Accurate identification of long-lived large flows

     .  Real-time identification of long-lived large flows

   Disadvantages of Automatic Hardware Identification

     .  Not supported in most routers

   The measurement interval for determining a candidate long-lived large
   flow and the minimum bandwidth of the long-lived large flow would be
   programmable parameters in the router; this is under further study.

   The implementation of automatic hardware identification of long-lived
   large flows is vendor dependent. Below is a suggested technique.

4.1.2.1. Suggested Technique for Automatic Hardware Identification

   There are multiple hash tables, each with a different hash function.
   Each hash table entry has an associated counter. On packet arrival, a
   new flow is looked up in parallel in all the hash tables and the
   corresponding counter is incremented. If the counter exceeds a
   programmed threshold in a given time interval in all the hash table
   entries, a candidate long-lived-flow is learnt and programmed in a

   hardware table resource like TCAM. There may be some false positives
   due to multiple short-lived small flows masquerading as a long-lived
   large flow; the amount of false positives is reduced by parallel
   hashing.

4.2. Long-lived Large Flow Re-balancing

   Below are suggested techniques for long-lived large flow re-
   balancing. Our suggestion is for the router vendors to implement all
   these techniques and let the operator choose the right technique
   based on various application needs.

4.2.1. No re-balancing of short-lived small flows

   In the LAG/ECMP group, choose other member component links with least
   average port utilization. Move the long-lived large flow(s) from the
   heavily loaded component link to the new member component links using
   a Policy based routing (PBR) rule in the ingress processing
   element(s) in the routers. The benefits of this algorithm are

     .  Short-lived small flows are not subjected to flow re-ordering

     .  Only certain long-lived large flows are subjected to flow re-
        ordering

4.2.2. Other Techniques

   It is possible use other algorithms, for example, removing a member
   component link from the LAG/ECMP group and using it only for long-
   lived large flows.

4.2.3. Re-balancing of long-lived large flows and short-lived small
   flows - an example

   Optimal LAG/ECMP component utilization for the use case in Figure 1,
   is depicted below in Figure 2. This is achieved as follows

   Step 1) Long-lived large flows are identified in the egress
   processing elements of router R1 using techniques suggested in
   Section 4.1.

   Step 2) An operator alert is generated indicating that egress
   component link (3) in router R1 is congested. The long-lived large
   flows mapping to the congested egress component link are exported
   from the router to a central management entity.

Internet-Draft   Best Practices for Optimal LAG/ECMP Component Link
          Utilization in Provider Backbone networks      September 2012


   Step 3) On receiving the alert about the congested component link
   (3), the operator, through a central management entity finds out the
   long-lived large flows mapping to the component link and the LAG/ECMP
   group to which the component link maps to.

   Step 4) The operator, through a central management entity, can choose
   to rebalance the long-lived large flows on lightly loaded component
   links of the LAG/ECMP group using the suggested techniques in Section
   4.2. In the router, a long-lived large flow is moved from component
   link (3) to component link (2) by using a PBR rule in the ingress
   processing element(s) in the routers.

   Detailed description for Figure 2 is as follows

     .  There is a LAG between 2 routers R1 and R2. This LAG has 3
        component links (1), (2), (3)

     .  Component link (1) has 2 short-lived small flows and 1 long-
        lived large flow and the link capacity is optimally utilized

     .  Component link (2) has 3 short-lived small flows and 1 long-
        lived large flow and the link capacity is optimally utilized

     .  Component link (3) has 2 short-lived small flows and 1 long-
        lived large flow and the link capacity is optimally utilized
