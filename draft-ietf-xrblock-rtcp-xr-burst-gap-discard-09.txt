1.  Introduction

1.1.  Burst and Gap Discard Report Block

   This document defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611] for use in a range of RTP applications.  The new block type
   supports the reporting of the proportion of packets discarded by the
   receiver due to jitter.  The discards during discard bursts are
   reported, together with the number of bursts.  This block is intended
   to be used in conjunction with [DISCARD] which provides the total
   packets discarded, and on which this block therefore depends.
   However the metric in [DISCARD] may be used independently of the
   metrics in this block.

   This block provides information on transient IP problems.  Burst/Gap
   metrics are typically used in Cumulative reports, however they also
   MAY be used in Interval reports.  The burstiness of packet discard
   affects user experience, may influence any sender strategies to
   mitigate the problem, and may also have diagnostic value.

   The metric belongs to the class of transport-related end system
   metrics defined in [RFC6792].

   The definitions of Burst, Gap, Loss and Discard are consistent with
   definitions in [RFC3611].  To accommodate the range of jitter buffer
   algorithms and packet discard logic that may be used by implementors,
   the method used to distinguish between bursts and gaps may be an
   equivalent method to that defined in[RFC3611].

1.2.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]
   defined an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This document defines a new Extended Report block for
   use with [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].

1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework

   The Performance Metrics Framework [RFC6390] provides guidance on the
   definition and specification of performance metrics.  The RTP
   Monitoring Architectures [RFC6792] provides guideline for reporting
   block format using RTCP XR.  The Metrics Block described in this
   document are in accordance with the guidelines in [RFC6390] and
   [RFC6792].

1.4.  Applicability

   These metrics are applicable to a range of RTP applications which
   contain jitter buffers and don't use stream repair means,e.g.,
   Forward Error Correction (FEC) [RFC5109] and/or retransmission
   [RFC4588].

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In addition, the following terms are defined:

   Received, Lost and Discarded

      A packet shall be regarded as lost if it fails to arrive within an
      implementation-specific time window.  A packet that arrives within
      this time window but is too early or late to be played out or
      thrown away before playout due to packet duplication or redundancy
      shall be regarded as discarded.  A packet shall be classified as
      one of received (or OK), discarded or lost.  The metric
      "cumulative number of packets lost" defined in [RFC3550] reports a
      count of packets lost from the media stream (single SSRC within
      single RTP session).  Similarly the metric "number of packets
      discarded" defined in [DISCARD] reports a count of packets
      discarded from the media stream (single SSRC within single RTP
      session) arriving at the receiver.  Another metric defined in
      [RFC5725] is available to report on packets which are not
      recovered by any repair techniques which may be in use.


   Bursts and Gaps

      The terms Burst and Gap are used in a manner consistent with that
      of RTCP XR [RFC3611].  RTCP XR views a RTP stream as being divided
      into bursts, which are periods during which the discard rate is
      high enough to cause noticeable quality degradation (generally
      over 5 percent discard rate), and gaps, which are periods during
      which discarded packets are infrequent and hence quality is
      generally acceptable.

3.  Burst/Gap Discard Block

   Metrics in this block report on Burst/Gap Discard in the stream
   arriving at the RTP system.  The measurement of these metrics are
   made at the receiving end of the RTP stream.  Instances of this
   Metrics Block refer by Synchronization source (SSRC) to the separate
   auxiliary Measurement Information block [RFC6776] which describes
   measurement periods in use (see RFC6776 section 4.2).  This Metrics
   Block relies on the measurement period in the Measurement Information
   block indicating the span of the report and SHOULD be sent in the
   same compound RTCP packet as the measurement information block.  If
   the measurement period is not received in the same compound RTCP
   packet as this Metrics Block, this Metrics Block MUST be discarded.

3.2.  Definition of Fields in Burst/Gap Discard Report Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      A Burst/Gap Discard Report Block is identified by the constant
      NBGD.

      [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NBGD with the IANA provided
      RTCP XR block type for this block.]


   Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bits

      This field is used to indicate whether the Burst/Gap Discard
      metrics are Sampled, Interval or Cumulative metrics:




Clark, et al.             Expires June 24, 2013                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          RTCP XR Burst/Gap Discard          December 2012


         I=10: Interval Duration - the reported value applies to the
         most recent measurement interval duration between successive
         metrics reports.

         I=11: Cumulative Duration - the reported value applies to the
         accumulation period characteristic of cumulative measurements.

         I=01: Sampled Value - the reported value is a sampled
         instantaneous value.

      In this document, Burst/Gap Discard Metrics can only be measured
      over definite intervals, and cannot be sampled.  Accordingly, the
      value I=01, indicating a sampled value, MUST NOT be used.  In
      addition, the value I=00 is reserved and also MUST NOT be used.
      The block MUST be discarded if the value I=01 or I=00 is received.


   Reserved (resv): 6 bits

      These bits are reserved.  They MUST be set to zero by senders and
      ignored by receivers (See RFC6709 section 4.2).


   block length: 16 bits

      The length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one.  For
      the Burst/Gap discard block, the block length is equal to 3.  The
      block MUST be discarded if the block length is set to a different
      value.


   SSRC of source: 32 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3611].


   Threshold: 8 bits

      The Threshold is equivalent to Gmin in [RFC3611], i.e. the number
      of successive packets that must not be discarded prior to and
      following a discard packet in order for this discarded packet to
      be regarded as part of a gap.


   Packets discarded in bursts: 24 bits

      The total number of packets discarded during discard bursts.

Internet-Draft          RTCP XR Burst/Gap Discard          December 2012


      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFE MUST be
      reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFF MUST be reported.


   Total packets expected in bursts: 24 bits

      The total number of packets expected during discarded bursts (that
      is, the sum of received packets and lost packets).

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFE MUST be
      reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFF MUST be reported.


   Reserved (resv): 8 bits

      These bits are reserved.  They MUST be set to zero by senders and
      ignored by receivers (See RFC6709 section 4.2).


3.3.  Derived metrics based on reported metrics

   The metrics described here are intended to be used in conjunction
   with information from the Measurement Information block [RFC6776]
   (which MUST be present in the same RTCP packet as the Burst/Gap
   Discard block) and also with the metric "number of packets discarded"
   provided in the RTCP XR Discard Count Block [DISCARD].  The RTCP XR
   Discard Count Block SHOULD be sent if the Burst/Gap Discard block is
   sent, but the converse does not apply.

   These metrics provide the following information relevant to
   statistical parameters, including:

   o  The fraction of packets discarded during bursts (burst discard
      rate in [SUMSTAT]), which can be calculated using the metric "
      Packets Discarded in Bursts " and the metric " Total Packets
      expected in Bursts " provided in the Burst/Gap Discard metrics
      block.

   o  The fraction of packets discarded during gaps (gap discard rate in
      [SUMSTAT]), which can be calculated using the metric " Packets
      Discarded in Bursts " and the metric " Total Packets expected in
      Bursts " provided in the Burst/Gap Discard metrics block.

   The details on calculation these parameters in the metrics are
   described in [SUMSTAT].

4.  Considerations for Voice-over-IP applications

   This Metrics Block is applicable to a broad range of RTP
   applications.  Where the metric is used with a Voice-overIP (VoIP)
   application and the stream repair means is not available, the
   following considerations apply.

   RTCP XR views a call as being divided into bursts, which are periods
   during which the discard rate is high enough to cause noticeable call
   quality degradation (generally over 5 percent discard rate), and
   gaps, which are periods during which discarded packets are infrequent
   and hence call quality is generally acceptable.

   If Voice Activity Detection is used the Burst and Gap Duration shall
   be determined as if silence packets had been sent, i.e. a period of
   silence in excess of Gmin packets MUST terminate a burst condition.

   The recommended value for the threshold Gmin in [RFC3611] results in
   a Burst being a period of time during which the call quality is
   degraded to a similar extent to a typical Pulse-Code Modulation(PCM)
   Severely Errored Second.

5.  SDP Signaling

   [RFC3611] defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol)
   [RFC4566] for signaling the use of XR blocks.  XR blocks MAY be used
   without prior signaling.

5.1.  SDP rtcp-xr-attrib Attribute Extension

   This section augments the SDP [RFC4566] attribute "rtcp-xr" defined
   in [RFC3611] by providing an additional value of "xr-format" to
   signal the use of the report block defined in this document.

   xr-format =/ xr-bgd-block

   xr-bgd-block = "brst-gap-dscrd"

5.2.  Offer/Answer Usage

   When SDP is used in offer-answer context, the SDP Offer/Answer usage
   defined in [RFC3611] for unilateral "rtcp-xr" attribute parameters
   applies.  For detailed usage in Offer/Answer for unilateral
   parameter, refer to section 5.2 of [RFC3611].

6.  IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.  For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to
   [RFC3611].

6.1.  New RTCP XR Block Type value

   This document assigns the block type value NBGD in the IANA " RTP
   Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR) Block Type Registry " to
   the "Burst/Gap Discard Metrics Block".

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NBGD with the IANA provided RTCP
   XR block type for this block.]

6.2.  New RTCP XR SDP Parameter

   This document also registers a new parameter "brst-gap-dscrd" in the
   "RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR) Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) Parameters Registry".

6.3.  Contact information for registrations


   The contact information for the registrations is:

7.  Security Considerations

   It is believed that this proposed RTCP XR report block introduces no
   new security considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611].
   This block does not provide per-packet statistics so the risk to
   confidentiality documented in Section 7, paragraph 3 of [RFC3611]
   does not apply.
