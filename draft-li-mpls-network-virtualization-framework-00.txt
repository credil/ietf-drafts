     Framework of Network Virtualization Based on MPLS Global Label
           draft-li-mpls-network-virtualization-framework-00

Abstract

   As the virtual network operators develop, it is desirable to provide
   better network virtualization solutions to facilitate the service
   provision.  In the past years, MPLS plays a key role in the process
   of implementing network virtualization.  This document introduces a
   new framework to implement network virtualization based on MPLS
   global label.  It can provide the virtualized network topology, nodes
   and links using MPLS global label which can make up the virtual
   network.

1.  Introduction

   The virtual network operators are in fast development.  They can
   deploy possible services based on the virtual network which is
   provided by the underlying network.  Owing to the technology
   limitation, the virtual network operators face following challenges:

   -- It is hard to get the traffic and data information of internal
   nodes.  So it is hard to develop value-added services.

   -- Traditional VPN technology is just to provide a transparent pipe
   for virtual network operators which cannot control and manage the
   internal nodes.

   -- Traditional technologies can not implement virtualization of
   network nodes and links.  It is hard to provide flexible virtual
   networks.

   -- It is unable to implement central control, which is hard to
   provide customized virtual networks based on policies and open APIs.

   For the virtual network operators, in order to provide better
   services it is necessary to get more control on the internal network
   nodes.  Traditional VPN solutions is just to provide virtual networks
   on the network edge.  This can not satisfy the new network
   virtualization requirement.  On the other hand, the underlying
   network operators do not hope to expose much internal network details
   to the virtual network operators.  Furthermore, it also exerts much
   burden on the virtual network operation and management if there is
   much internal network details for the virtual network operators.

   In order to solve the problems of existing solutions and satisfy new
   virtual network requirements, it is desirable to provide a central
   controlled network virtualization solution which can provide flexible
   customized virtual networks easily.  This document introduces a new
   framework to implement network virtualization based on MPLS global
   label.  It can provide the virtualized network topology, nodes and
   links using MPLS global label which can make up the virtual network
   easily.

2.  Terminology

   Underlying Network: It is the network which the virtual network is
   built based on.  The underlying network can be the physical network
   or the virtual network.

   MPLS Virtual Network: The virtual network is built based on the
   underlying network.  It is composed by virtual nodes and virtual
   links which are identified by MPLS global label.  In this document,
   the concept of virtual network is the same as that of MPLS virtual
   network.

   MPLS Virtual Network Topology: It is the topology of the MPLS virtual
   network.  It can be identified by multi-topology ID of corresponding
   virtual network.  MPLS global label is allocated to represent the
   virtual network topology.

   Underlying Link: It is the link in the underlying network which the
   virtual link is built based on.  The underlying link can be physical
   link or the virtual link.

   MPLS Virtual Link: The virtual link is built based on the underlying
   link with specific attribute requirement.  It can be identified by
   MPLS global label.  In this document, the concept of virtual link is
   the same as that of MPLS virtual link.

   Underlying Node: It is the node in the underlying network which the
   virtual node is built based on.  The underlying node can be physical
   node or the virtual node.

   MPLS Virtual Node: The virtual node is built based on the underlying
   node with specific attribute requirement.  It can be identified by
   MPLS global label.  In this document, the concept of virtual node is
   the same as that of MPLS virtual node.

3.  Framework

   MPLS is always a basic technology to implement network
   virtualization.  L3VPN and VPLS are typical network virtualization
   solutions based on MPLS technologies.  VPN technologies provides
   virtual network at the network edge based on BGP or T-LDP.  In order
   to provide better virtual network services the internal network
   should be virtualized to be provided to the virtual network
   operators.  Then IGP is a better choice to combine with MPLS
   technologies to provide these virtual networks.

   In the MPLS virtual network, virtual nodes and virtual links are
   basic components.  They can be represented by unique MPLS global
   label values.  In addition, in order to differentiate virtual
   networks, the virtual network topology can be identified by multi-
   topology ID and the unique MPLS global label value can also be
   allocated to represent the virtual network topology.  Thus the
   network topology, the node and the link can be virtualized by MPLS.
   They can hide the details of the underlying network.

   The architecture to construct virtual network is shown in the
   following figure.  There is a central controller to control network
   nodes.  The controller can construct different virtual networks
   according to the requirements proposed by the virtual network
   operators.  IGP runs among the controller and the network nodes.
   MPLS global labels can be allocated by the IGP controller for the
   virtual network topologies, the virtual nodes and the virtual links.
   The label binding between the MPLS global label and the virtual
   network topology/node/link are flooded among the controller and the
   network nodes.  When the network nodes receive the label mapping
   messages, they will install corresponding MPLS forwarding entries
   accordingly.

   represented by the Link Global Label (L-GL).  In the virtual network
   shown in the figure 2, there are three virtual links identified by
   L-GL 1, L-GL 2 and L-GL 3 and there are three virtual nodes

   constructs a triangle virtual topology identified by VT-GL 1.  The
   virtual network operators can provision their own service based on
   the virtual network.  Especially, for the virtual link, it can have
   common attributes such as bandwidth, MTU, etc. like the physical
   link.  The virtual network operators need not care about the physical
   details of links of the virtual network.  For example, the bandwidth
   for the virtual link is 10G. It may be an independent physical
   interface, or a virtual link allocating 10G bandwidth from a physical
   interface, or a virtual interface constructed by compositing several
   physical interfaces.  All the details of the underlying network are
   hidden from the virtual network operators.  This can simplify the
   network operation and management for the virtual network operators
   which can focus more on their own service provision.  On the other
   hand, the hidden details can improve security of the underlying
   network to some extent.

4.  MPLS Virtualization of Network Topology

   In essence, constructing virtual networks is to construct different
   virtual network topologies based on the underlying network.  The
   virtual network topology can be identified by the Multi-Topology ID.
   The global label for the virtual network topology is allocated by the
   IGP controller.  The label binding between the Multi-Topology ID and
   the Global Label are flooded from the IGP controller to the network
   nodes.

   The network nodes should support the multi-topology.  It can install
   FIBs for multi-topologies.  That is, there are multiple forwarding
   instances in one network node.  Each forwarding instance is
   corresponding to a virtual network topology.

   When network nodes receive the label binding between the Multi-
   Topology ID and the Global Label, it will install one MPLS forwarding
   entry: The incoming label is the Global Label.  It will be mapped to
   the forwarding instance corresponding to the Multi-Topology.

   When packets of different virtual networks are forwarded in the
   network nodes, they must encapsulate the global label binded with the
   Multi-Topology, Thus the network node receiving the packet will get
   the label from the MPLS encapsulation and find the corresponding MPLS
   forwarding entry.  Then the packet will be mapped to the
   corresponding forwarding instance to determine how to forward in the
   corresponding virtual network.  If the packet is to be forwarded to
   the next hop in the virtual network, when it leaves the network node,
   the global label must be encapsulated again.

5.  MPLS Virtualization of Network Nodes

   MPLS Virtual nodes can be built based on the underlying node in a
   specific underlying network.  They can be identified by unique MPLS
   global label allocated for the tuple { Multi-Topology ID, Underlying
   Node Identification, Attributes of the Virtualized Node }.  Multi-
   topology ID is the identification of the corresponding multi-topology
   of the underlying network.  The underlying node can be identified by
   the node's address (typically the loopback address) if the underlying
   node is the physical network node or it can be identified by another
   global label corresponding to the underlying virtual node.  When

   incoming label is the Global Label.  It will be mapped to the
   forwarding information related with the virtualized nodes.  The
   forwarding information is derived according to the specific
   application requirement.  For example, in Segment Routing, the
   forwarding information can be the shortest path to the underlying
   node.  In addition, the forwarding identification for the specified
   attributes to the virtual node can also be provided in the forwarding
   information.

6.  MPLS Virtualization of Network Links

   MPLS Virtual links can be built based on the underlying link in a
   specific underlying network.  They can be identified by unique MPLS
   global label allocated for the tuple { Multi-Topology ID, Underlying
   Link Identification, Attributes of the Virtualized Link }.  Multi-
   topology ID is the identification of the corresponding multi-topology
   of the underlying network.  The underlying link can be identified by
   the link ID or the link's address (typically the pair of the
   addresses of two end-points of the link) if the underlying link is
   the physical network link or it can be identified by another global
   label corresponding to the underlying virtual link.  When implement
   virtual links, IGP controller will allocate the global label for the
   tuple { Multi-Topology ID, Underlying Link Identification, Attributes
   of the Virtualized Link }. Then the label binding between the tuple
   and the Global Label are flooded from the IGP controller to the
   network nodes.

   When network nodes receive the label binding between the tuple and
   the Global Label, it will install one MPLS forwarding entry in the
   forwarding instance corresponding to the Multi-Topology ID: The
   incoming label is the Global Label.  It will be mapped to the
   forwarding information related with the virtualized links.  The
   forwarding information is derived according to the specific
   application requirement.

   The typical attribute for the virtualized link is the bandwidth.
   When the virtual network need a virtual link with specific bandwidth
   requirement, IGP controller will create the virtual link by
   allocating the global label for the tuple {Multi-Topology ID,
   Underlying Link Identification, Bandwidth} and flood the label
   binding to the network nodes.  When network nodes receive the label
   binding, it will reserve the bandwidth firstly based on the
   underlying link to provide QoS service of bandwidth guarantee.  Then
   it will create the MPLS forwarding entry shown in the following
   figure:

   +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   |   Multi-Topology FIB                                          |

   |                                            +--------------+   |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+


7.  Forwarding in Virtual Network

   If the packet is forwarded in a specific virtual network, the global
   label binding with the virtual network topology should be
   encapsulated in the packet.  Thus the network node receiving the
   packet will get the VT-GL to map to the corresponding forwarding
   instance to determine how to forward the packet in the virtual
   network.

   There are two ways to use the virtualized nodes and links for
   forwarding.

   1.  Traditional SPF or CSPF Path Calculation

   The virtualized nodes and links can be added to the LSDB or be added
   to the TEDB after applying specific MPLS TE attributes.  Then these
   nodes and links can be involved in the path calculation based on SPF

   or CSPF.  Then the IP forwarding entry or MPLS TE forwarding entry
   may be created which can use the virtual link as the outgoing link.
   A typical IP Routing forwarding entry is shown in the following
   figure:

   +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Multi-Topology FIB                                                         |
   |                                                           +--------------+ |
   | +------------------+------+   +-----------------------+   | QOS Process  | |
   | | D-IP | D-IP Mask | L-GL |-->| Underlying Link | QID |-->|  based on    | |
   | +------------------+------+   +-----------------------+   |  Bandwidth   | |
   |                                                           +--------------+ |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+


   In this case, the forwarding entry related with L-GL is not an
   independent entry.  It is combined with other information
   (Destination IP address and destination IP mask in the example) to
   compose the forwarding entry.  For packets which may use the
   forwarding entry, they need not encapsulate the L-GL.  The L-GL is
   just like an internal index to link different parts of the forwarding
   information.

   2.  Segment Routing

   The MPLS virtual nodes and links can also be used for Segment
   Routing.  The MPLS forwarding entry for the virtualized nodes and
   links can be created for the Segment Routing.  The MPLS virtual node
   is just like the Node Segment in the Segment Routing.  The MPLS
   virtual link is just like the Adjacency Segment in the Segment
   Routing.  The difference is that MPLS global label is used for the
   Adjacency instead of the local label since in the virtual network the
   unique identification based on the MPLS global label can simplify the
   network operation and management.  In addition, there are specific
   attributes for the virtual link and virtual node, there should be
   fowarding process identification of the corresponding attribute in
   the forwarding entry.  The typical Segment Routing forwarding entry
   is shown in the following figure:

   |                                                +-----------+  |
   |   +--------+    +--------------------------+   | Attribute |  |
   |   |  N-GL  |--->|Outgoing Link|Nexthop| ID |-->|           |  |
   |   +--------+    +--------------------------+   |  Process  |  |
   |                                                +-----------+  |
   |                                             +--------------+  |

   |   |  L-GL |--->| Underlying Link | QID |--->|  based on    |  |
   |   +-------+    +-----------------------+    |  Bandwidth   |  |
   |                                             +--------------+  |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+


   In this case, the forwarding entry related with N-GL or L-GL is the
   independent MPLS forwarding entry.  For packets which may use the
   forwarding entry, they must encapsulate the N-GL or the L-GL.
