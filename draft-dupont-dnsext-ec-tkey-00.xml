      <t>This document updates the TKEY resource record specifications
      for the use of Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman, and related IANA
      registries.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The TKEY resource record <xref target="RFC2930" /> was designed
      to enable the establishment of a shared secret between DNS client
      and server, using GSS-API or a Diffie-Hellman exchange.</t>

      <t>The purpose of this document is to modernize the cryptography
      used by the Diffie-Hellman variant of TKEY, i.e., to move to
      ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman). As a side effect,
      registries for the DH KEY <xref target="RFC2539" /> and SIG(0)
      <xref target="RFC2931" /> resource records are updated.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
      in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC2119</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="ECDH groups">
      <t>This document specifies a new "well-known group" with
      a 1536 bit prime for the DH KEY resource record
      <xref target="RFC2539" />, taken from the expired
      revision <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsext-rfc2539bis-dhk" />,
      in the <xref target="group3" />. (this group is supported
      by some implementations, the idea is to make it official)</t>

      <t>The NIST P-256 and P-384 curve groups are added as groups 13
      and 14. These groups are already used in several IETF RFCs,
      including <xref target="RFC5114" />, or for DNSSEC
      <xref target="RFC6605" />. A public key is the uncompressed form
      of a curve point, so on twice 256 or 384 bits. The shared secret
      is the first coordinate of the Diffie-Hellman common value, so
      on 256 or 384 bits.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="ECDH TKEY">
      <t>The ECDH TKEY reuses the DH TKEY (<xref target="RFC2930">
      RFC2930</xref> section 4.1) specification with some changes.</t>

      <t>The Diffie-Hellman exchange uses the Elliptic Curve P-256
      group, the hash function is SHA-256.</t>

      <t>The "key data" lengths MUST be at least 128 bits / 16 octets,
      and SHOULD be at most 256 bits / 32 octets.</t>

      <t>The "keying material" is derived using the formula
      (taken from <xref target="RFC4306">IKEv2</xref>):
      <figure><artwork>
      keymat = HMAC-SHA-256(query data | server data, ECDH value)
      </artwork></figure></t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>The
      "DNS KEY Record Diffie-Hellman Well-Known Prime/Generator Pairs"
      registry is modified by the addition of entries for 3, 13 and 14,
      with "A 1536 bit prime", "EC P-256" and "EC P-384" for descriptions,
      and this document for the reference.</t>

     <t>The "DNS Security Algorithm Numbers" registry is modified by
     adding TKEY in the "transaction security mechanisms" and
     by making ECDSAP256SHA256 and ECDSAP384SHA384 eligible for
     transaction security.</t>

     <t>The "SIG (0) Algorithm Numbers" registry is either updated /
     aligned with the preceding one, or simply suppressed as its
     content was merged into the preceding one.</t>
   </section>

   <section title="Security Considerations">
     <t>The Elliptic Curve cryptography is considered as being as
     safe as the modular prime field one but with faster
     operations and far smaller payloads, so should be
     a vector for better security.</t>

     <t>In the same way, more support and use of TKEY
     should be encouraged. This is why it had to be
     re-based on modern cryptography tools.</t>

     <t>To share a private key for two different usages
     is recognized as a bad practice, so when an ECDH TKEY
     is authenticated by ECDSAP256SHA256, the private
     key SHOULD NOT be shared.</t>
