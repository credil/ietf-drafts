      defines a way for communication between legacy DHCPv4 clients
      with DHCPv4 servers over IPv6-only transport. It requires the
      deployment of Client Relay Agent (CRA) that transmits messages
      to IPv6-Transport Server (TSV) or IPv6-Transport Relay Agent
      (TRA). The deployed CRA must know the address of a TSV or TRA to
      forward incoming client's messages. This document defines an
      DHCPv6 option that may be used to provision the TSV or TRA location

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6"/> defines a way
      for communication between legacy DHCPv4 clients with DHCPv4
      servers (defined in <xref target="RFC2131"/>) over IPv6-only
      transport. It requires the deployment of Client Relay Agent (CRA)
      that transmits messages to IPv6-Transport Server (TSV) or
      IPv6-Transport Relay Agent (TRA). There are several
      scenarios envisaged, all of them assume that CRA needs to know
      the recipient address of the DHCPv4-over-IPv6 traffic.</t>

      <t>Depending on the scenario discussed, the DHCPv4 over IPv6
      transport endpoint could be either an IPv6-Transport Server (TSV)
      or an IPv6-Transport Relay Agent (TRA). Both cases are
      indistinguishable from the CRA's perspective. CRA needs to know TSV's
      or TRA's IPv6 address in advance to relay traffic.</t>

      <t>As the CRA uplink is IPv6-only (otherwise there would be no need
      to deploy DHCPv4 over IPv6), the only feasible way to provision
      information to CRA is over DHCPv6. Therefore this document specifies
      a DHCPv6 option that conveys the necessary information to CRA. To be
	  more specific, a single <xref target="RFC3315">DHCPv6</xref> option
	  is used, expressing the TRA's or TSV's Fully Qualified Domain Name
	  (FQDN) to the CRA.</t>
      
    </section>

    <section title='The DHCPv4-Over-IPv6 DHCPv6 Option' anchor='option-name'>
      <t>The DHCPv4-over-IPv6 option is a DHCPv6 option. It consists
      of an option-code and option-len fields (as all DHCPv6 options
      have), and a variable length dhcpv4-over-ipv6-endpoint-name
      field containing a fully qualified domain name that refers to
      the DHCPv4 over IPv6 transport endpoint to which the CRA MAY
      transport DHCPv4 traffic. This name represents a TRA or TSV,
      depending on deployment scenario.</t>

      <t>The DHCPv4-over-IPv6 option SHOULD NOT appear in any other
      than the following DHCPv6 messages: Solicit, Advertise, Request,
      Renew, Rebind, Information-Request and Reply.</t>

      <t>The format of the DHCPv4 over IPv6 option is shown in the
      following figure:</t>

 OPTION_DHCP4_OVER_V6: (TBD)

           option-len: Length of the dhcpv4-over-ipv6-endpoint-name
                       field, expressed in octets.

  dhcpv4-over-ipv6-endpoint-name: A fully qualified domain name 
                     of the DHCPv4-over-IPv6 transport endpoint.
        </artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>The dhcpv4-over-ipv6-endpoint-name field is formatted as
      required in <xref target="RFC3315">DHCPv6</xref> Section 8
        (&quot;Representation and Use of Domain Names&quot;).  Briefly, the
        format described uses a single octet noting the length of one
        DNS label (limited to at most 63 octets), followed by the label
        contents.  This repeats until all labels in the FQDN are exhausted,
        including a terminating zero-length label.  Any updates to Section 8
	of <xref target="RFC3315">DHCPv6</xref> also apply to encoding of this
	field.  An example format for this option is shown in
	<xref target="fqdn-example"/>, which conveys the FQDN
	&quot;dhcp.example.com.&quot;.</t>

      <figure align="center" anchor="fqdn-example"
       title="Example dhcpv4-over-ipv6-endpoint-name.">

      </figure>

      <t>Note that in the specific case of the
        <xref target="fqdn-example">example</xref>,
	the length of the dhcpv4-over-ipv6-endpoint-name is 18 octets, and so an
	option-len field value of 18 would be used.</t>

      <t>The option is validated by confirming that all of the
      following conditions are met:
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>the option-len is greater than 3;</t>
        <t>the option data can be contained by the option length, and
		the option length does not run off the end of the packet;</t>
        <t>the individual label lengths do not exceed the option length;</t>
        <t>the dhcpv4-over-ipv6-endpoint-name is of valid format as described
        in DHCPv6 Section 8 <xref target="RFC3315"/>;</t>
        <t>there are no compression tags;</t>
        <t>there is at least one label of nonzero length.</t>
      </list>
      </t>

    <section title="DHCPv6 Server Behavior">
      <t>A DHCPv6 server SHOULD NOT send more than one DHCPv4-over-IPv6
      option.  It SHOULD NOT permit the configuration of multiple
      names within one DHCPv4-over-IPv6 option.  Both of these
      conditions are handled as exception by the client, so an
      operator using software that does not perform these validations
      should be careful not to configure multiple domain names.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC3315">RFC 3315 Section 17.2.2</xref>
      describes how a DHCPv6 client and server negotiate configuration
      values using the Option Request Option (OPTION_ORO).  As a
      convenience to the reader, we mention here that a server will
      not reply with a DHCPv4-over-IPv6 option if the client has not
      explicitly enumerated it in its Option Request Option. In other
      words, server SHOULD send this option only if client explicitly
      requested it in ORO.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="DHCPv6 Client Behavior">
      <t>A client that supports the DHCPv4 over IPv6 functionality
      and conforms to this specification MUST include OPTION_DHCP4_OVER_V6
      on its OPTION_ORO.</t>

      <t>Because it requires DNS name to address resolution, the client SHOULD
        also wish to include the <xref target="RFC3646">OPTION_DNS_SERVERS</xref> 
        option on its OPTION_ORO.</t>

      <t>If the client receives the DHCPv4-over-IPv6 option, it MUST verify the
        option contents as described in <xref target="option-name"/>.</t>

      <t>If the CRA entity receives more than one DHCPv4-over-IPv6 option, it
        MUST use only one instance of that option.</t>

      <t>If the DHCPv4-over-IPv6 option contains more than one FQDN,
      as distinguished by the presence of multiple root labels, the CRA entity
      system MUST use only the first FQDN listed in configuration. It SHOULD
      warn its operator about such condition.</t>

      <t>The CRA entity performs standard DNS resolution using the provided FQDN
        to resolve a AAAA Resource Record, as defined in
        <xref target="RFC3596"/> and STD 13 <xref target="RFC1034"/>
        <xref target="RFC1035"/>.</t>

      <t>If any DNS response contains more than one IPv6 address (probably for
	  redundancy and high availability consideration), the CRA entity picks
	  only one IPv6 address and uses it as a DHCPv4-over-IPv6 transport
	  endpoint for the interface being configured in the current message
	  exchange. The CRA system MUST NOT establish more than one transport
	  at the same time per interface.</t>

      <t>Note that a CRA system may have multiple network interfaces,
      and these interfaces may be configured differently; some may be
      connected to networks that call for DHCPv4-over-IPv6, and some
      may be connected to networks that are using normal dual stack or
      other means.  The CRA entity should approach this specification
      on an interface-by-interface basis.  For example, if the CRA
      entity is attached to multiple networks that provide the
      DHCPv4-over-IPv6 option, then the CRA entity MUST configure a
      DHCPv4 over IPv6 transport for each interface separately as each
      transport provides IPv4 connectivity for each distinct
      interface. Means to bind a DHCPv4-over-IPv6 transport
      configuration to a given interface in a multiple interfaces
      device are out of scope of this document.

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document does not present any new security issues, but as with
      all DHCPv6-derived configuration state, it is completely possible that
      the configuration is being delivered by a third party (Man In The
      Middle).  As such, there is no basis to trust the access the address of
	  which is provisioned following this specification, and it should
      not therefore bypass any security mechanisms such as IP firewalls.</t>

      <t>It should be noted that DHCPv4 over IPv6 traffic may bypass
      existing firewalls that are typically configured to drop
      incoming outside DHCPv4 over IPv4 and DHCPv6 over IPv6 traffic.</t>

      security issues.</t>

      security issues.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA is kindly requested to allocate DHCPv6 option code TBD
      to the OPTION_DHCP4_OVER_V6. The value should be added to the
      DHCPv6 option code space defined in Section 24.3 of <xref
      target="RFC3315"/>.</t>
