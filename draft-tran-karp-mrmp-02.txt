         The Use of G-IKEv2 for Multicast Router Key Management
                        draft-tran-karp-mrmp-02

Abstract

   The G-IKEv2 key management protocol protects group traffic, usually
   in the form of IP multicast communications between a set of network
   devices.  This memo defines extensions to G-IKEv2 allowing it to
   protect routing protocols between a group of network devices.

Internet-Draft                G-IKEv2-MRKM                  October 2012


1.  Introduction

   The G-IKEv2 protocol [I-D.yeung-g-ikev2] has been defined to
   distribute group policy and keys to a group of network devices.  It
   uses IKEv2 protocols, incorporating payloads similar to GDOI
   [RFC6407].  This memo describes a mode of using G-IKEv2 to protect
   routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, PIM) and is known as G-IKEv2 for
   Multicast Router Key Management (G-IKEv2-MRKM).  Two models of group
   security are discussed.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Overview of Group Key Management

   When a group of network devices need to communicate using multicast
   communications, the devices need to share keying material and the
   policy associated with that keying material.  A group key management
   (GKM) protocol is used to securely distribute this keying material
   and associated policy.  Typically each network device (also known as
   a group member (GM)) needing to participate in the group "registers"
   to a group controller/key server (GCKS), during which mutual
   authentication and authorization occur.  The GCKS also distributes
   current group policy and keying material to the group member over an
   authenticated and encrypted session.

   Many routing protocols are designed such that each participating
   network device sources network packet that one or more peers receive,
   often using link-local multicast addresses.  Using GKM terminology,
   this is an M-to-N communication model [RFC3740], which provides for
   many senders and receivers.  However, varying group security models
   are possible.  Two relevant examples are:

   o  Multiple-sender security associations.  Each network devices
      protects packets using the same keying material and policy,
      distributed by a single GCKS.  When network devices require high
      reliability a single GCKS is not sufficient, so may require an
      election among currently available authorized members to choose a
      GCKS before network communications can be protected.  This
      approach is taken in [I-D.hartman-karp-mrkmp].  A simpler approach
      may be found by requiring all election messages to be
      authenticated, which effectively sets up a full mesh of
      authenticated connections.

Internet-Draft                G-IKEv2-MRKM                  October 2012


   o  Single-sender security associations.  Each network device sending
      routing protocol packets acts as its own key server, essentially
      converting an M-to-N communication model to M 1-to-N groups (where
      M is the number of authorized members participating in the routing
      protocol).  A full mesh of authenticated connections is again
      required, but the lack of an election protocol may result in a
      simpler system.

   The methods in the memo support both Multiple-sender security
   associations and single-sender security associations.

   The G-IKEv2 GKM protocol provides for a GM receiving security
   associations from a GCKS in two IKEv2 exchanges: the IKE_SA_INIT
   exchange [RFC5996] to setup the encrypted session, and the GSA_AUTH
   exchange [I-D.yeung-g-ikev2] (similar in construction to the IKEv2
   IKE_AUTH protocol) to authenticate, authorize, and distribute group
   policy.


3.  Exchanges

   The exchange of private keying material between two network devices
   using a dedicated key management protocol is a common requirement.
   There is no need to define an entirely new protocol for routing
   protocols having this requirement when existing mature protocol
   exchanges and methods have been vetted.  This memo extends the
   G-IKEv2 protocol exchanges, state machine, and policy definitions.

   The following two exchanges enable the group member to register to
   the key server to get the policy, traffic selector and keys used to
   communicate with others group member.

   The IKE_SA_INIT exchange is a two-message exchange allows the group
   member and key server devices to negotiate cryptographic algorithms,
   exchange nonces, and do a Diffie-Hellman exchange [DH].  At the
   conclusion of the IKE_SA_INIT, the group member (e.g., router) and
   key server can exchange private messages.  For the details of this
   exchange, refer to IKE_SA_INIT in RFC 5996.

       Group Member(Initiator)        Key Server (Responder)
       -----------------------        ----------------------
       HDR, SAi1, KEi, Ni        -->
                                 <--  HDR, SAr1, KEr, Nr, [CERTREQ,]

                   Figure 1: IKEv2 IKE_SA_INIT Exchange

   Next, the group member and key server devices perform a GSA_AUTH,
   which is substantially the same as the IKE_AUTH exchange defined in



Tran & Weis              Expires April 25, 2013                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                G-IKEv2-MRKM                  October 2012


   RFC 5996, except that the SA, TSi, TSr payloads in IKE_AUTH are not
   used.  Policy and traffic selectors are pushed from the key server to
   group member using new payloads GSA and KD.  For the details of the
   rest of the exchange please refer to Section 4 of
   [I-D.yeung-g-ikev2].  Section Section 4 of this document includes
   additional GSA definitions specifically for the purpose of protecting
   routing protocol traffic.

     Group Member (Initiator)              Key Server (Responder)
     ------------------------              ----------------------
     HDR, SK {IDi, [CERT,] [CERTREQ,]
              [IDr,] AUTH, IDg}       -->
                                      <--  HDR, SK {IDr, [CERT,] AUTH,
                                                    GSA, KD}

                    Figure 2: G-IKEv2 GSA_AUTH Exchange

   In the GSA_AUTH exchange, the group member sends the identification
   of the group to which it wants to join or register.  The key server
   authenticates and authorizes the group member and pushes the policy,
   traffic selector in GSA payload, and the key in the KD payload to the
   group member.  At the successful conclusion of the GSA_AUTH exchange,
   the group member has policy and keying material to securely
   communicate with others group members that also registered with the
   key server.  With this IKEv2 SA established between GM and KS, the GM
   can request for policy and keys of an additional group using the
   GSA_CLIENT_SERVER exchange.  In the GSA_CLIENT_SERVER exchange, the
   GM will send group ID that it wants to join, where the key server
   response will include policy (GSA) and key material (KD).

         Group Member (Initiator)          Key Server (Responder)
         ------------------------          ----------------------
         HDR, SK {IDg}              -->
                                    <--    HDR, SK { GSA, KD, [D ]}

               Figure 3: G-IKEv2 GSA_CLIENT_SERVER Exchange

   Once a GSA_AUTH has completed the group member and key server MAY
   destroy the G-IKEv2 SA.  However when the number of group members is
   small, as is usually the case for routing protocol participants, it
   is RECOMMENDED for them to maintain the G-IKEv2 association SA for
   the key server to notify group members that they should re-register
   in order to obtain new group policy.  This notify exchange replaces a
   separate rekey mechanism optimized for large group.

   In some cases, a GCKS may need to change the group policy and/or
   rekey before current keys expire.  In cases where the G-IKEv2 rekey
   protocol is not used the GCKS can send an INFORMATIONAL exchange with

Internet-Draft                G-IKEv2-MRKM                  October 2012


   a Notify payload directing the group member to re-register using a
   REGISTER_REQUESTED status notify message (value TBD).  This event
   triggers a GSA_CLIENT_SERVER exchange, as described above.  The
   response to GSA_CLIENT_SERVER from the KS may include Delete payloads
   instructing the group member to delete old SAs.  Alternatively, the
   GCKS policy may support the G-IKEv2 group maintenance channel and the
   GCKS can distribute a GSA_REKEY exchange with new policy and keying
   material (see Section 3.3 of [I-D.yeung-g-ikev2]).


4.  Header and Payload Formats

   The protocol defined in this memo uses IKEv2 and G-IKEv2 payload
   definitions.  However, new security policy definitions are described
   to support security transforms and policy defined by routing protocol
   documents.  When a routing protocol indicates the use of ESP or AH,
   existing G-IKEv2 SA Payload types suffice.

4.1.  Group Security Association Payload

   The Group Security Association (GSA) payload contains one or more
   sets of policy that a router is willing to use to protect a routing
   protocol.  It is identical to the GSA payload described in Section
   4.3 of [I-D.yeung-g-ikev2].  This memo makes no changes to this
   payload.

4.1.1.  GSA TEK Policy

   One of the GSA types is the Traffic Encryption Key (TEK) policy.  The
   TEK describes the Traffic Encryption Policy defined by a supported
   security protocol.  Some routing protocol definitions (i.e., OSPFv3
   [RFC4552], LMP [RFC4204], and PIM [RFC5796]) describe the use of ESP
   and AH, which are supported by existing G-IKEv2 TEK policy
   definitions.  However, a number of routing protocol specific security
   transforms exist and these require new TEK definitions.

   Section 4.5 of [I-D.yeung-g-ikev2] defines the TEK payload as a
   Protocol-ID followed by a TEK Protocol-Specific Payload, replicated
   in Figure 4 for reference.

      defined by the corresponding protocol.

   o  SPI (variable) - The SPI defined by the GCKS representing this
      TEK.  In many cases, the SPI is referred to as a Key ID by routing
      protocol specifications.

   o  Source & Destination Traffic Selectors - The traffic selectors
      describe the source and the destination of the protecting traffic.
      The format and values are defined in IKEv2 [RFC5996], section
      3.13.1.

   o  Transforms - One or more substructures specifying the transform
      information.  The format is defined in IKEv2 [RFC5996], section

                Figure 8: Survey of RP Integrity Algorithms

   None of these are currently represented as current IKEv2 INTEG
   transform values, primarily because the output has not been defined
   by the routing protocol transforms to be truncated.  Since these
   transforms are mutually exclusive to the transforms defined in the
   Transform Type 3 - Integrity Algorithm Transform IDs IKEv2 IANA
   table, and to reduce confusion between IPsec integrity transform
   values and routing protocol transform values, this memo defines a new
   transform to describe the routing protocol integrity transforms.
   Transform IDs for the RP-INTEG Transform attributes types are shown
   in Figure 9.  Attributes

4.1.1.2.2.  Extended Sequence Numbers

   Some routing protocol transforms have introduced a 64-bit sequence
   number.  This can be signaled using the Extended Sequence Numbers
   Transform.  No changes are required to the Extended Sequence Numbers
   Transform.


5.  IANA Considerations

   G-IKEv2 [I-D.yeung-g-ikev2] defines a new registry.  This memo adds
   the following definitions to this registry.  (TBD)

   A new IKEv2 Transform (RP_INTEG) is defined for declaring routing
   protocol integrity algorithms.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document describes a use case of group key management using
   G-IKEv2.  The security considerations in [I-D.yeung-g-ikev2] directly
   apply to this memo.


7.  Acknowledgements

   Sam Hartman and Dacheng Zhang previously published the MRKMP protocol
   [I-D.hartman-karp-mrkmp], which includes many operations and protocol
   elements in common with this memo.
