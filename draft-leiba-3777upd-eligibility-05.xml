        RFC 3777 specifies that "sitting members" of
        the IAB and IESG "may not volunteer to serve on the nominating commitee".
        Since that document was written the IAOC was formed, and that body is not
        covered by RFC 3777.  There is also uncertainty about whether ex-officio members
        and liaisons are included as "sitting members".
        This document updates RFC 3777 and clarifies those situations.

      <t>
        The "Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees" document
        <xref target="RFC3777"/> defines the nominating committee process.
        One of the key points in the process and in the selection of the nominating committee is
        that the IETF wants to avoid having its top leadership be self-selecting:
        the leaders should not be the ones who choose the leaders.
        The selection of the nominating committee, therefore, excludes those individuals who are
        in top leadership positions currently.
      </t>
      <t>
        That said, it would be bad to eliminate people who have the experience
        necessary to understand of the IETF process: those individuals can bring
        a broader perspective to the nominating committee and will help ensure that the
        people it selects for the leadership positions are better prepared to
        fulfill the roles.
      </t>
      <t>
        RFC 3777 specifies that "sitting members" of
        the IAB and IESG "may not volunteer to serve on the nominating committee".
        Since that document was written the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC)
        was formed, some IAOC members are selected by the nominating committee
        (see <xref target="RFC4071"/>, Section 4),
        and that body is not covered by RFC 3777.
        There is also uncertainty about whether ex-officio members
        liaisons, and such are included as "sitting members".
        This document updates RFC 3777 and clarifies those situations,
        with the understanding that the intent
        of RFC 3777 was to exclude those currently in IETF leadership positions
        from voting on the selection of the new leadership.
      </t>
      <t>
        In order to allow the largest reasonable list of potential nominating committee members,
        we do not want to exclude those at lower levels of IETF leadership.
        In particular, this document does not exclude participation from working
        group chairs, IRTF research group chairs, members of directorates and special
        review teams, and members of other advisory bodies.

    <section anchor="upd" title="Replacement of RFC 3777, Section 4, Rule 15">
      <t>
        The following paragraph replaces RFC 3777, Section 4, rule 15 in its entirety.
      </t>
      <t>
        15.  Any person who serves on any of the Internet Society Board of
        Trustees, the IAB, the IESG, or the IAOC, including those who serve
        on these bodies in ex-officio positions, may not volunteer to serve
        as voting members of the nominating committee.
        Liaisons to these bodies from other bodies or organizations are not
        excluded by this rule.
