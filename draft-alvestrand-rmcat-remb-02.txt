1.  Introduction

   This document proposes an RTCP feedback message signalling the
   estimated total available bandwidth for a session.

   If this function is available, it is possible to implement the
   algorithm in [I-D.alvestrand-rtcweb-congestion], or other algorithms
   with the same kind of feedback messaging need, in a fashion that
   covers multiple RTP streams at once.


2.  Receiver Estimated Max Bitrate (REMB)

2.1.  Semantics

   This feedback message is used to notify a sender of multiple media
   streams over the same RTP session of the total estimated available
   bit rate on the path to the receiving side of this RTP session.

   Within the common packet header for feedback messages (as defined in
   section 6.1 of [RFC4585]), the "SSRC of packet sender" field
   indicates the source of the notification.  The "SSRC of media source"
   is not used and SHALL be set to 0.  This usage of the value zero is
   also done

   The reception of a REMB message by a media sender conforming to this
   specification SHALL result in the total bit rate sent on the RTP
   session this message applies to being equal to or lower than the bit
   rate in this message.  The new bit rate constraint should be applied
   as fast as reasonable.  The sender is free to apply additional
   bandwidth restrictions based on its own restrictions and estimates.

2.2.  Message format

   This document describes a message using the application specific
   payload type.  This is suitable for experimentation; upon
   standardization, a specific type can be assigned for the purpose.

   The message is an RTCP message with payload type 206.  RFC 3550
   [RFC3550] defines the range, RFC 4585 defines the specific PT value
   206 and the FMT value 15.

   The fields V, P, SSRC, and length are defined in the RTP
   specification [2], the respective meaning being summarized below:

   version (V): (2 bits):   This field identifies the RTP version.  The
               current version is 2.

   padding (P) (1 bit):   If set, the padding bit indicates that the
               packet contains additional padding octets at the end that
               are not part of the control information but are included
               in the length field.  Always 0.

   Feedback message type (FMT) (5 bits):  This field identifies the type
               of the FB message and is interpreted relative to the type
               (transport layer, payload- specific, or application layer
               feedback).  Always 15, application layer feedback
               message.  RFC 4585 section 6.4.

   Payload type (PT) (8 bits):   This is the RTCP packet type that
               identifies the packet as being an RTCP FB message.
               Always PSFB (206), Payload-specific FB message.  RFC 4585
               section 6.4.

   Length (16 bits):  The length of this packet in 32-bit words minus
               one, including the header and any padding.  This is in
               line with the definition of the length field used in RTCP
               sender and receiver reports [3].  RFC 4585 section 6.4.

Internet-Draft                    REMB                      January 2013


   SSRC of packet sender (32 bits):  The synchronization source
               identifier for the originator of this packet.  RFC 4585
               section 6.4.

   SSRC of media source (32 bits):  Always 0; this is the same
               convention as in [RFC5104] section 4.2.2.2 (TMMBN).

   Unique identifier (32 bits):  Always 'R' 'E' 'M' 'B' (4 ASCII
               characters).

   Num SSRC (8 bits):  Number of SSRCs in this message.

   BR Exp (6 bits):   The exponential scaling of the mantissa for the
               maximum total media bit rate value, ignoring all packet
               overhead.  The value is an unsigned integer [0..63], as
               in RFC 5104 section 4.2.2.1.

   BR Mantissa (18 bits):   The mantissa of the maximum total media bit
               rate (ignoring all packet overhead) that the sender of
               the REMB estimates.  The BR is the estimate of the
               traveled path for the SSRCs reported in this message.
               The value is an unsigned integer in number of bits per
               second.

   SSRC feedback (32 bits)  Consists of one or more SSRC entries which
               this feedback message applies to.

2.3.  Signaling of use of this extension

   Either end of an RTP session can send this message.  There is no
   signalling to indicate that the message can be understood.

   OPEN ISSUE: Do we need signalling, and if so, how should it be done?

   It does not seem harmful to send it when recipient does not
   understand it, but negotiating it may give better behaviour when it
   is not available (by falling back to per-RTP-session TMMBR messages).


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests no action of IANA.

   This section can be removed upon publication as an RFC.

4.  Security Considerations

   If the RTCP packet is not protected, it is possible to inject fake
   RTCP packets that can increase or decrease bandwidth.  This is not
   different from security considerations for any other RTCP message.


5.  Acknowledgements

   This proposal has emerged from discussions between, among others,
   Justin Uberti, Magnus Flodman, Patrik Westin, Stefan Holmer and
   Henrik Lundin.

Appendix A.  Change log

A.1.  From appendix of -congestion-01 to -00

   The timestamp option was removed.  Discussion concluded that the RFC
   5450 [RFC5450] "transmission time offset" header likely gives
   accurate enough send-time information for our purposes.

A.2.  From -00 to -02

   No changes.  These are "keepalive" publications.
