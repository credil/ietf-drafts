Internet-Draft       Simplified Extension of interface Space   June 2013

  
1.  Introduction

   The IS-IS specification has an implicit limit of 255 interfaces, as
   constrained by the eight-bit Circuit ID field carried in various
   packets.  Moderately clever implementers have realized that the only
   true constraint is that of 255 LAN interfaces, and for that matter
   only 255 LAN interfaces for which a system is the Designated IS.
   This is because the only place that the circuit ID is advertised in
   LSPs is in the pseudo-node LSP ID.

   Implementers have treated the point-to-point circuit ID number space
   as being independent from that of the LAN interfaces, since these
   circuit IDs appear only in IIH PDUs and are only used for detection
   of a change in identity at the other end of a link.  More than 255
   point-to-point interfaces have been supported by sending the same
   circuit ID on multiple interfaces. See [RFC5303].
   
   However, that solution suffers from restrictions required to maintain
   interoperability with systems that do not support the extensions.

   This document defines extensions that allow a system to exceed the
   255 interfaces limit and do so in a way that has no interoperability
   issues with systems that do not support the extension.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 


3.  Definition of Commonly Used Terms

   This section provides definitions for terms that are used throughout
   the text.  The terminology is consistent with that used in RFC 5311.
 
   Originating IS: A physical IS running the IS-IS protocol.  As
   this document describes a method that allows a single physical IS to
   run additional interfaces in name of multiple extend ISs, the
   Originating IS represents the single physical IS.

   Normal system-id: The system-id of an Originating IS as defined  by
   [IS-IS]. 

   Additional system-id: A system-id other than the "Normal system-id",  
   that is assigned by the network administrator to an Extend-IS in
   order to extend the interface range.  The Additional system-id, like
   the Normal system-id, must be unique throughout the routing area
   (Level-1) or domain (Level-2), and must be different with the 
   Additional system-id used to extend LSPs in RFC5311.

   Extending IS: The system, identified by an Additional system-id, for
   the interfaces beyond 255 to enabled with.   

   Local System: A physical IS running the IS-IS protocol, including
   Originating IS and Extending ISs.

4.  Proposed Solution
   
   The extension proposed to IS-IS to relax the 255 interfaces limit,
   Extending IS, same defined as Virtual IS in RFC 5311, is introduced 
   to be only used for extending the interfaces. Circuit index is
   allocated based on IS, one extended IS 255 more interfaces. Here's
   the diagrams:

                  
                   R1                           R255
                     \                           /   
                      I1          ...          I255
                   ____\_______________________/_________          
                  |                                      |         
                  |             Originating IS           |         
                  |______________________________________|         
                           /                   \               
                          /                     \              
                         /                       \             
                ________/______                ___\___________
               | extending IS' |     ...      | extending IS" |
               |_______________|              |_______________|
                  /        \                      /       \
                 I'1 ...   I'255                I"1  ... I"255
                /            \                  /           \
               R'1           R'255             R"1          R"255
               

                 Figure 1: Extend interface space by extending IS
   
       where Rx are remote routers, Ix are interface to remote routers.

   When interface space is exceeded, for example I'x and I"x as
   illustrated in Figure 1 is enabled in the name of extending IS, which
   means R'x is peered with extending IS' and R"x is peered with 
   extending IS", NOT with Originating IS.  The Originating IS MUST
   specify extending ISs as a neighbor, with metric set to zero. 
   Extending ISs MUST specify the Originating IS as a neighbor with
   metric set to zero. The adjacency between Originating IS and
   Extending ISs SHOULD be considered as point-to-point.
   
   Hello packet sending

   Additional system-id is used for the Hello Packets sending on The
   interface which is running in Extending IS.
 
   LSP FLOOD

   When a new LSP has been received, it must be flooded out some set
   of the local system's interfaces including Original IS's interfaces
   and all Extending ISs's interfaces. Also, a self-originated LSP must
   be flooded out all the local system's interfaces including Original
   IS's interfaces and all Extending ISs's interfaces.

   Route Calculation

   In local system, LSP Database including all Extending ISs's LSP
   should be used in route calculation. All Extending ISs's interfaces
   should be used in nexthop calculation.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document raises no new security issues for IS-IS.  IS-IS
   security may be used to secure the IS-IS messages discussed here.
   See [RFC5304].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
