1.  Introduction

1.1.  Loss Concealment and Concealment Seconds Metrics Reporting Block

   At any instant, the audio output at a receiver may be classified as
   either 'normal' or 'concealed'.  'Normal' refers to playout of audio
   payload received from the remote end, and also includes locally
   generated signals such as announcements, tones and comfort noise.
   Concealment refers to playout of locally-generated signals used to
   mask the impact of network impairments or to reduce the audibility of
   jitter buffer adaptations.

   This draft defines two new concealment related block types to augment
   those defined in [RFC3611] for use in a range of RTP applications.
   These two block types extend packet loss concealment mechanism
   defined in section 4.7.6 of RFC3611.

   The first block type provides metrics for actions taken by the
   receiver to mitigate the effect of packet loss and packet discard.
   Specifically, the first metric (On-Time Playout Duration) reports the
   duration of normal playout of data which the receiver obtained from
   the sender's stream.  A second metric (Loss Concealment Duration)
   reports the total time during which the receiver played out media
   data which was manufactured locally, because the sender's data for
   these periods was not available due to packet loss or discard.  A
   similar metric (Buffer Adjustment Concealment Duration) reports the
   duration of playout of locally-manufactured data replacing data which
   is unavailable due to adaptation of an adaptive de-jitter buffer.
   Further metrics (Playout Interrupt Count and Mean Playout Interrupt
   Size) report the number of times normal playout was interrupted, and
   the mean duration of these interruptions.

   Loss Concealment Duration and Buffer Adjustment Concealment Duration
   are reported separately because buffer adjustment is typically
   arranged to occur in silence periods so may have very little impact
   on user experience, whilst loss concealment may occur at any time.

   The second block type provides metrics for concealment seconds, which
   are measured at the receiving end of the RTP stream.  Specifically,
   the first metric (Unimpaired Seconds) reports the number of whole
   seconds occupied only with normal playout of data which the receiver
   obtained from the sender's stream.  The second metric (Concealed
   Seconds) reports the number of whole seconds during which the
   receiver played out any locally-generated media data.  A third metric
   (Severely Concealed Seconds) reports the number of whole seconds
   during which the receiver played out locally-generated data for more
   than SCS Threshold (ms).

   These metrics belongs to the class of transport-related terminal
   metrics defined in [RFC6792].

1.2.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]
   defined an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This draft defines a new Extended Report block that
   MUST be used as defined in [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].

1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework

   The Performance Metrics Framework [RFC6390] provides guidance on the
   definition and specification of performance metrics.  The RTP
   Monitoring Architectures [RFC6792] provides guideline for reporting
   block format using RTCP XR.  The Metrics Block described in this
   document are in accordance with those guidelines.

1.4.  Applicability

   These metrics are applicable to audio applications of RTP and the
   audio component of Audio/Video applications in which the packet loss
   concealment machinery is contained at the receiving end to mitigate
   the impact of network impairments to user's perception of media
   quality.

3.  Loss Concealment Block

   The metrics block described here are intended to be used as described
   in this section, in conjunction with information from the Measurement
   Information block [RFC6776].  Instances of this Metrics Block refer
   by Synchronization source (SSRC) to the separate auxiliary
   Measurement Information block [RFC6776] which describes measurement
   periods in use (see [RFC6776] section 4.2).  This Metrics Block
   relies on the measurement period in the Measurement Information block
   indicating the span of the report and SHOULD be sent in the same
   compound RTCP packet as the measurement information block.  If the
   measurement period is not received in the same compound RTCP packet
   as this Metrics Block, this metrics block MUST be discarded.

3.2.  Definition of Fields in Loss Concealment Metrics Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      A Loss Concealment Metrics Report Block is identified by the
      constant NLC.

      [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NLC with the IANA provided
      RTCP XR block type for this block.]

Internet-Draft             RTCP XR Concealment                 June 2013


   Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bit

      This field is used to indicate whether the Loss Concealment
      metrics are Sampled, Interval or Cumulative metrics:

         I=10: Interval Duration - the reported value applies to the
         most recent measurement interval duration between successive
         metrics reports.

         I=11: Cumulative Duration - the reported value applies to the
         accumulation period characteristic of cumulative measurements.

         I=01: Sampled Value - the reported value is a sampled
         instantaneous value.


   Packet Loss Concealment Method (plc): 2 bits

      This field is used to identify the packet loss concealment method
      in use at the receiver, according to the following code:

         bits 014-015

            0 = silence insertion

            1 = simple replay, no attenuation

            2 = simple replay, with attenuation

            3 = enhancement

            Other values reserved


      Note that the enhancement method (plc =3 )for packet loss
      concealment offers an improved audio quality and or a better
      robustness against packet losses [G.711] and is equivalent to
      enhanced in section 4.7.1 of [RFC3611],


   Reserved (resv): 4 bits

      These bits are reserved.  They MUST be set to zero by senders and
      ignored by receivers (See [RFC6709] section 4.2).

Internet-Draft             RTCP XR Concealment                 June 2013


   block length: 16 bits

      The length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one.  For
      the Loss Concealment Block, the block length is equal to 5.


   SSRC of source: 32 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3611].


   On-time Playout Duration (ms): 32 bits

      'On-time' playout is the uninterrupted, in-sequence playout of
      valid decoded audio information originating from the remote
      endpoint.  This includes comfort noise during periods of remote
      talker silence, if VAD [VAD] is used, and locally generated or
      regenerated tones and announcements.

      An equivalent definition is that on-time playout is playout of any
      signal other than those used for concealment.

      On-time playout duration MUST include both speech and silence
      intervals, whether VAD is used or not.  This duration is reported
      in millisecond units.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFFFE
      MUST be reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFFFF MUST be reported.


   Loss Concealment Duration (ms): 32 bits

      The duration, in milliseconds, of audio playout corresponding to
      Loss-type concealment.

      Loss-type concealment is reactive insertion or deletion of samples
      in the audio playout stream due to effective frame loss at the
      audio decoder.  "Effective frame loss" is the event in which a
      frame of coded audio is simply not present at the audio decoder
      when required.  In this case, substitute audio samples are
      generally formed, at the decoder or elsewhere, to reduce audible
      impairment.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFFFE
      MUST be reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFFFF MUST be reported.

Internet-Draft             RTCP XR Concealment                 June 2013


   Buffer Adjustment Concealment Duration (ms): 32 bits

      The duration, in milliseconds, of audio playout corresponding to
      Buffer Adjustment-type concealment, if known.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFFFE
      MUST be reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFFFF MUST be reported.

      Buffer Adjustment-type concealment is proactive or controlled
      insertion or deletion of samples in the audio playout stream due
      to jitter buffer adaptation, re-sizing or re-centering decisions
      within the endpoint.

      Because this insertion is controlled, rather than occurring
      randomly in response to losses, it is typically less audible than
      loss-type concealment.  For example, jitter buffer adaptation
      events may be constrained to occur during periods of talker
      silence, in which case only silence duration is affected, or
      sophisticated time-stretching methods for insertion/deletion
      during favorable periods in active speech may be employed.

      Concealment events which cannot be classified as Buffer
      Adjustment-type MUST be classified as Loss-type.


   Playout Interrupt Count: 16 bits

      The number of interruptions to normal playout which occurred
      during the reporting period.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE MUST be
      reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.


   Mean Playout Interrupt Size (ms): 16 bits

      The mean duration, in ms, of interruptions to normal playout which
      occurred during the reporting period.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE MUST be
      reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.

4.  Concealment Seconds Block

   This sub-block described here is intended to be used as described in
   this section, in conjunction with information from the Measurement
   Information block [RFC6776] and provides a description of potentially
   audible impairments due to lost and discarded packets at the
   endpoint, expressed on a time basis analogous to a traditional PSTN
   T1/E1 errored seconds metric.  Instances of this Metrics Block refer
   by Synchronization source (SSRC) to the separate auxiliary
   Measurement Information block [RFC6776] which describes measurement
   periods in use (see [RFC6776] section 4.2).  This Metrics Block
   relies on the measurement period in the Measurement Information block
   indicating the span of the report and SHOULD be sent in the same
   compound RTCP packet as the measurement information block.  If the
   measurement period is not received in the same compound RTCP packet
   as this Metrics Block, this metrics block MUST be discarded.

   The following metrics are based on successive one second intervals as
   declared by a local clock.  This local clock does NOT need to be
   synchronized to any external time reference.  The starting time of
   this clock is unspecified.  Note that this implies that the same loss
   pattern could result in slightly different count values, depending on
   where the losses occur relative to the particular one-second
   demarcation points.  For example, two loss events occurring 50ms
   apart could result in either one concealed second or two, depending
   on the particular 1000 ms boundaries used.

   The seconds in this sub-block are not necessarily calendar seconds.
   At the tail end of a session, periods of time of less than 1000ms
   shall be incorporated into these counts if they exceed 500ms and
   shall be disregarded if they are less than 500ms.

4.2.  Definition of Fields in Concealed Seconds Metrics Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      A Concealed Seconds Metrics Report Block is identified by the
      constant NCS.

      [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NCS with the IANA provided
      RTCP XR block type for this block.]


   Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bit

      This field is used to indicate whether the Concealment Seconds
      Metrics are Sampled, Interval or Cumulative metrics:

         I=10: Interval Duration - the reported value applies to the
         most recent measurement interval duration between successive
         metrics reports.

         I=11: Cumulative Duration - the reported value applies to the
         accumulation period characteristic of cumulative measurements.

            Other values reserved


      Note that the enhancement method (plc =3) for packet loss
      concealment offers an improved audio quality and or a better
      robustness against packet losses [G.711] and is equivalent to
      enhanced in section 4.7.1 of [RFC3611],


   Reserved (resv): 4 bits

      These bits are reserved.  They MUST be set to zero by senders and
      ignored by receivers (See [RFC6709] section 4.2).


   Block Length: 16 bits

      The length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one.  For
      the Concealment Seconds Block, the block length is equal to 4.


   SSRC of source: 32 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3611].


   Unimpaired Seconds: 32 bits

      A count of the number of unimpaired Seconds that have occurred.

      An unimpaired Second is defined as a continuous period of 1000ms
      during which no frame loss or discard due to late arrival has
      occurred.  Every second in a session must be classified as either
      OK or Concealed.

      Normal playout of comfort noise or other silence concealment
      signal during periods of talker silence, if VAD is used, shall be
      counted as unimpaired seconds.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFFFE
      MUST be reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFFFF MUST be reported.


   Concealed Seconds: 32 bits

      A count of the number of Concealed Seconds that have occurred.

      A Concealed Second is defined as a continuous period of 1000ms
      during which any frame loss or discard due to late arrival has
      occurred.

      Equivalently, a concealed second is one in which some Loss-type
      concealment has occurred.  Buffer adjustment-type concealment
      SHALL not cause Concealed Seconds to be incremented, with the
      following exception.  An implementation MAY cause Concealed
      Seconds to be incremented for 'emergency' buffer adjustments made
      during talkspurts.

      Loss-type concealment is reactive insertion or deletion of samples
      in the audio playout stream due to effective frame loss at the
      audio decoder.  "Effective frame loss" is the event in which a
      frame of coded audio is simply not present at the audio decoder
      when required.  In this case, substitute audio samples are
      generally formed, at the decoder or elsewhere, to reduce audible
      impairment.

      Buffer Adjustment-type concealment is proactive or controlled
      insertion or deletion of samples in the audio playout stream due
      to jitter buffer adaptation, re-sizing or re-centering decisions
      within the endpoint.

      Because this insertion is controlled, rather than occurring
      randomly in response to losses, it is typically less audible than
      loss-type concealment.  For example, jitter buffer adaptation
      events may be constrained to occur during periods of talker
      silence, in which case only silence duration is affected, or
      sophisticated time-stretching methods for insertion/deletion
      during favorable periods in active speech may be employed.  For
      these reasons, buffer adjustment-type concealment MAY be exempted
      from inclusion in calculations of Concealed Seconds and Severely
      Concealed Seconds.

      However, an implementation SHOULD include buffer-type concealment
      in counts of Concealed Seconds and Severely Concealed Seconds if
      the event occurs at an 'inopportune' moment, with an emergency or
      large, immediate adaptation during active speech, or for
      unsophisticated adaptation during speech without regard for the
      underlying signal, in which cases the assumption of low-audibility
      cannot hold.  In other words, jitter buffer adaptation events
      which may be presumed to be audible SHOULD be included in
      Concealed Seconds and Severely Concealed Seconds counts.

      Concealment events which cannot be classified as Buffer
      Adjustment- type MUST be classified as Loss-type.

      For clarification, the count of Concealed Seconds MUST include the
      count of Severely Concealed Seconds.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFFFE
      MUST be reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFFFF MUST be reported.

   Severely Concealed Seconds: 16 bits

      A count of the number of Severely Concealed Seconds.

      A Severely Concealed Second is defined as a non-overlapping period
      of 1000 ms during which the cumulative amount of time that has
      been subject to frame loss or discard due to late arrival, exceeds
      the SCS Threshold.

      If the measured value exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE MUST be
      reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
      measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be reported.


   Reserved: 8 bits

      These bits are reserved.  They MUST be set to zero by senders and
      ignored by receivers (See [RFC6709] section 4.2).


   SCS Threshold: 8 bits

      The SCS Threshold defines the amount of time corresponding to lost
      or discarded frames that must occur within a one second period in
      order for the second to be classified as a Severely Concealed
      Second.  This is expressed in milliseconds and hence can represent
      a range of 0.1 to 25.5 percent loss or discard.

      A default threshold of 50ms (5% effective frame loss per second)
      is suggested.

5.  SDP Signaling

   [RFC3611] defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol)
   [RFC4566] for signaling the use of XR blocks.  XR blocks MAY be used
   without prior signaling.

5.1.  SDP rtcp-xr-attrib Attribute Extension

   This section augments the SDP attribute "rtcp-xr" [RFC3611] by
   providing two additional values of "xr-format" to signal the use of
   two report blocks defined in this document.

   xr-format =/ xr-conceal-block
              / xr-conc-sec-block

   xr-conceal-block = "loss-conceal"
   xr-conc-sec-block = "conc-sec" ["=" thresh]

   thresh      = 1*DIGIT          ; threshold for SCS (ms)
   DIGIT          = %x30-39

5.2.  Offer/Answer Usage

   When SDP is used in offer-answer context, the SDP Offer/Answer usage
   defined in [RFC3611] applies.  Note that "thresh" is declared by the
   offer.

6.  IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.  For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to
   [RFC3611].

6.1.  New RTCP XR Block Type values

   This document assigns two block type values in the IANA "RTP Control
   Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR) Block Type Registry ":

   Name:       LCB
   Long Name:  Loss Concealment Block
   Value       <LCB>
   Reference:  Section 3.1

   Name:       CSB
   Long Name:  Concealment Seconds Block
   Value       <CSB>
   Reference:  Section 4.1

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace <NLC> and <NCS> with the RTCP XR
   block type assigned by IANA for this block.]

6.2.  New RTCP XR SDP Parameters

   This document also registers two new parameters in the "RTP Control
   Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR) Session Description Protocol
   (SDP) Parameters Registry":

   o  "loss-conceal"

   o  "conc-sec"

6.3.  Contact information for registrations


   The contact information for the registrations is:

7.  Security Considerations

   It is believed that this proposed RTCP XR report block introduces no
   new security considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611].
   This block does not provide per-packet statistics so the risk to
   confidentiality documented in Section 7, paragraph 3 of [RFC3611]
   does not apply.
