    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes to use only IPv6 link-local addresses on
      infrastructure links between routers, wherever possible. It discusses
      the advantages and disadvantages of this approach to aide the decision
      process for a given network,</t>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>An infrastructure link between a set of routers typically does not
      require global or even <xref target="RFC4193">unique local
      addressing</xref>. Using link-local addressing on such links has a
      number of advantages, for example that routing tables do not need to
      carry link addressing, and can therefore be significantly smaller. This
      helps to decrease failover times in certain routing convergence events.
      An interface of a router is also not reachable beyond the link
      boundaries, therefore reducing the attack horizon.</t>

      <t>We propose to configure neither globally routable IPv6 addresses nor
      unique local addresses on infrastructure links of routers, wherever
      possible. We recommend to use exclusively link-local addresses on such
      links.</t>

      <t>This document discusses the advantages and caveats of this
      approach.</t>

    <section anchor="using"
             title="Using Link-Local Address on Infrastructure Links"
             toc="default">
      <t>This document proposes to use only link-local addresses (LLA) on all
      router interfaces on infrastructure links. Routers typically do not need
      to be reached from from users of the network, nor from outside the
      network. For an network operator there may be reasons to send packets to
      an infrastructure link for certain monitoring tasks; we suggest that
      many of those tasks could also be handled differently, not requiring
      routable address space on infrastructure links.</t>

      <section anchor="approach" title="The Suggested Approach" toc="default">
        <t>Neither global IPv6 addresses nor unique local addresses are
        configured on infrastructure links. In the absence of specific global
        or unique local address definitions, the default behavior of routers
        is to use link-local addresses.</t>

        <t>The effect on specific traffic types is as follows:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Control plane protocols, such as BGP, ISIS, OSPFv3, RIPng, PIM
            work by default or can be configured to work with link-local
            addresses.</t>

            <t>Management plane traffic, such as SSH, or ICMPv6 echo requests
            can be addressed to loopback addresses of routers with a global
            scope address. Router management can also be done over out-of-band
            channels.</t>

            <t>Data plane traffic is forwarded independently of the link
            address type.</t>

            <t>Neighbor discovery (neighbor solicitation and neighbor
            advertisement) is done by using link-local unicast and multicast
            addresses, therefore neighbor discovery is not affected.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t><xref target="RFC4443">ICMPv6</xref> error messages
        (packet-too-big...) are required for routers, therefore a loopback
        interface must be configured with a global scope IPv6 address. This
        global scope IPv6 address will be used as the source IPv6 address for
        all generated ICMPv6 messages.</t>

        <t>We therefore conclude that it is possible to construct a working
        network in this way.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="advantages" title="Advantages" toc="default">
        <t>Smaller routing tables: Since the routing protocol only needs to
        carry one loopback address per router, it is smaller than in the
        traditional approach where every infrastructure link addresses are
        carried in the routing protocol. This reduces memory consumption, and
        increases the convergence speed in some routing failover cases.</t>

        <t>Reduced attack surface: Every globally routable address on a router
        constitutes a potential attack point: a remote attacker can send
        traffic to that address, for example a TCP SYN flood, or he can intent
        SSH brute force password attacks. If a network only uses loopback
        addresses for the routers, only those loopback addresses need to be
        protected from outside the network. This significantly eases
        protection measures, such as infrastructure access control lists.</t>

        <t>Lower configuration complexity: LLAs require no specific
        configuration, thereby lowering the complexity and size of router
        configurations. This also reduces the likelihood of configuration
        mistakes.</t>

        <t>Less address space: The proposal uses less address space than when
        infrastructure links carry global address space.</t>

        <t>Simpler DNS: Less address space in use also means less DNS mappings
        to maintain.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="caveats" title="Caveats and Possible Workarounds"
               toc="default">
        <t>Interface ping: If an interface doesn't have a globally routable
        address, it can only be pinged from a node on the same link. Therefore
        it is not possible to ping a specific link interface remotely. A
        possible workaround is to ping the loopback address of a router
        instead. In most cases today it is not possible to see which link the
        packet was received on; however, <xref target="RFC5837">RFC5837</xref>
        suggests to include the interface identifier of the interface a packet
        was received on in the ICMP response. With this approach it would be
        possible to ping a router on the loopback address, yet see which
        interface the packet was received on. To check liveliness of a
        specific interface it may be necessary to use other methods, for
        example to connect to the router via SSH and to check locally.</t>

        <t>Traceroute: Similar to the ping case, a reply to a traceroute
        packet would come from a loopback address with a global address. Today
        this does not display the specific interface the packets came in on.
        Also here, <xref target="RFC5837">RFC5837</xref> provides a
        solution.</t>

        <t>Hardware dependency: LLAs are usually EUI-64 based, hence, they
        change when the MAC address is changed. This could pose problem in a
        case where the routing neighbor must be configured explicitly (e.g.
        BGP) and a line card needs to be physically replaced hence changing
        the EUI-64 LLA and breaking the routing neighborship. But, LLAs can be
        statically configured such as fe80::1 and fe80::2 which can be used to
        configure any required static routing neighborship.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Summary" toc="default">
        <t>Using link-local addressing only on infrastructure links has a
        number of advantages, such as a smaller routing table size and a
        reduced attack surface. It also simplifies router configurations.
        However, the way certain network management tasks are carried out has
        to be adapted to provide the same level of detail, for example
        interface identifiers in traceroute.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Using LLAs only on infrastructure links reduces the attack surface of
      a router: Loopback addresses with globally routed addresses are still
      reachable and must be secured, but infrastructure links can only be
      attacked from the local link. This simplifies security of control and
      management planes. The proposal does not impact the security of the data
      plane. This proposal does not address <xref target="RFC6192">control
      plane</xref> attacks generated by data plane packets (such as hop-limit
      expiration).</t>

      <t>As in the traditional approach, also this approach relies on the
      assumption that all routers can be trusted due to physical and
      operational security.</t>

      <t>There are no IANA considerations or implications that arise from this
