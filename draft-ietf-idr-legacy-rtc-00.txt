            Automatic Route Target Filtering for legacy PEs
                      draft-ietf-idr-legacy-rtc-00

Abstract

   This document describes a simple procedure that allows "legacy" BGP
   speakers to exchange route target membership information in BGP
   without using mechanisms specified in RFC 4684.  The intention of the
   proposed technique is to help in partial deployment scenarios and is
   not meant to replace RFC 4684.

Internet-Draft           legacy PE RT Filtering             January 2012


1.  Introduction

   [RFC4684], "Constrained Route Distribution for Border Gateway
   Protocol/ MultiProtocol Label Switching (BGP/MPLS) Internet Protocol
   (IP) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)" provides a powerful and general
   means for BGP speakers to exchange and propagate Route Target
   reachability information and constrain VPN route distribution to
   achieve high scale.  However, it requires that all the BGP speakers
   in the network are upgraded to support this functionality.  For
   example, in a network with route reflectors (RR), if one PE client in
   the cluster doesn't support constrained distribution, the cluster
   degenerates into storing and processing all the VPN routes.  The
   route reflectors need to request and store all the network routes
   since they do not receive route target membership information from
   the legacy PEs.  The RR will also generate all those routes to the
   legacy PEs and the legacy PEs will end up filtering the routes and
   store the subset of VPN routes that are of interest.

   This document specifies a mechanism for such legacy PE devices using
   existing configuration and toolset to provide similar benefits as
   [RFC4684].  At the same time, it is backward-compatible with the
   procedures defined in [RFC4684].  It also allows graceful upgrade of
   the legacy router to be [RFC4684] capable.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Basic Idea

   The basic idea is to make use of VPN unicast route exchange from the
   legacy PEs to a new BGP speaker (e.g. an RR) to signal RT membership.
   The legacy PEs announce a set of "special" routes with mapped RTs to
   the RR along with a standard community (defined in this document).
   The presence of the community triggers the RR to extract the RTs and
   build RT membership information.


3.  Detailed Operation

3.1.  Legacy PE Behavior

   The following simple steps are performed on the legacy PE device:

   o  Collect the "import route targets" of all the configured customer
      VRFs.  Let's call this set 'IRTS'.

   o  Create a special "route-filter VRF" with a route distinguisher(RD)
      that's configured with the same value across the network for all
      legacy PE devices.  Note: the equivalence of the RD value is for
      optimization - the operator may choose to use different values.

   o  Originate one or more routes in this VRF and attach a subset of
      'IRTS' as "translated route-target extended communities" with each
      route so as to evenly distribute the RTs (and to make sure they
      can fit into one BGP UPDATE message).  Collectively, the union of
      the "translated route-target extended communities" of all these
      routes is equal to the set 'IRTS'.  The translated RTs are
      attached as export route-targets for the routes originated in the
      route-filter VRF.

   o  The translation of the IRTs is necessary in order to refrain from
      importing "route-filter" VRF routes into VPN VRFs that would
      import the same route-targets.  The translation of the IRTS is
      done as follows.  For a given IRT, the equivalent translated RT
      (TRT) is constructed by means of swapping the value of the high-
      order octet of the Type field for the IRT (as defined in
      [RFC4360]).

      As an example, if IRT R= 65500:12244(hex: 0x0002ffdc00002fd4),
      equivalent route-filter TRT: 255.220.0.0:12244(hex:
      0x0102ffdc00002fd4).  One shortcoming of the translation mechanism
      is a possible collision between IRTs and TRTs if the network has
      been configured with RTs of multiple higher order octet types
      (2-byte AS, IP address, and 4-byte AS).  It is expected that such
      a configuration is rare in practice.

   o  As an alternative to the translation of the IRTS, the subset of
      the 'IRTS' can be attached as-is (without swapping the type field
      as described earlier) as "export route-target extended
      communities" with each route so as to evenly distribute the RTs

      (and to make sure they can fit into one BGP UPDATE message).  In
      this case, the IRT subsets can be attached in outbound policy to
      avoid the route-filter VRFs from being imported into VPN VRFs.
      Also in this case, the route-filter VRF routes must be tagged with
      a different special community (from that associated with the
      translated RTs) as described in Section 4 so that the receiving
      BGP speaker can distinguish the two cases.

   o  The routes are marked with NO_ADVERTISE and NO_EXPORT well-known
      communities as well as the appropriate new community that's
      defined in this document Section 4.  Note that there is no
      specific provision made to disallow configuration of subsequent
      route policies that can potentially alter the set of communities
      attached to "route-filter" VRF routes.  The protocol behavior in
      such a case is undefined and the use of those policy statements is
      discouraged.

3.2.  RR behavior

   Upon receiving the "route-filter" routes, the BGP speaker does its
   usual processing to store them in its local RIB.  It recognizes them
   as route-filter routes based on the association of the new standard
   community as defined in this document.  If required (as indicated by
   the community value), it translates the attached route-target
   extended communities (TRT) to equivalent import route-targets (IRT).
   Finally it creates the route-target filter list for each legacy
   client by collecting the entire set of route targets.  From this
   point onwards, the behavior is similar to that defined in [RFC4684].
   The RR does not propagate the routes further because of their
   association with NO_ADVERTISE community.  Also the VPN EoR that is
   sent by the legacy PE should also be used as an indication that the
   legacy PE is done sending the route-filter information as per the
   procedures defined in [RFC4684] for implementing a EoR mechanism to
   signal the completion of initial RT membership exchange.

3.2.1.  Generating Route Target Membership NLRIs for the legacy PE
        clients

   The RR MAY also translate the received extended communities from
   legacy clients into route target membership NLRIs as if it had
   received those NLRIs from the client itself.  This is useful for
   further propagation of the NLRIs to rest of the network to create RT
   membership flooding graph.  When the route_filter routes are received
   with same RD (from all legacy PE speakers), processing of the paths
   to generate equivalent NLRIs becomes fairly easy.

4.  ROUTE_FILTER community

   This memo defines four BGP communities that are attached to BGP
   UPDATE messages at the legacy PE devices and processed by the route
   reflectors as defined above.  They are as follows:

   +----------------------------+--------------------------------------+
   |          Community         | Meaning                              |
   +----------------------------+--------------------------------------+
   |       ROUTE_FILTER_v4      | RTs are attached as-is for VPNv4     |
   |                            | route filtering                      |
   |             ...            | ...                                  |
   |       ROUTE_FILTER_v6      | RTs are attached as-is for VPNv6     |
   |                            | route filtering                      |
   |             ...            | ...                                  |
   | ROUTE_FILTER_TRANSLATED_v4 | Translated RTs are attached for      |
   |                            | VPNv4 route filtering                |
   |             ...            | ...                                  |
   | ROUTE_FILTER_TRANSLATED_v6 | Translated RTs are attached for      |
   |                            | VPNv6 route filtering                |
   +----------------------------+--------------------------------------+

   In the absence of (or lack of support of) AF specific communities
   (ROUTE_FILTER_v6, ROUTE_FILTER_TRANSLATED_v6), the ROUTE_FILTER_v4 or
   ROUTE_FILTER_TRANSLATED_v4 MAY be treated by an implementation as a
   default VPN route-filter community to build a combination VPN filter
   for all VPN AFs (VPNv4, VPNv6) present on the RR.  This is in
   accordance with the procedures in [RFC4684] to build combination
   route-filters for VPN AFs and AF specific route-filters defined in
   [I-D.keyur-bgp-af-specific-rt-constrain].  If this is the case, then
   subsequent receipt of any "route-filter" routes with AF specific
   communities (ROUTE_FILTER_v6, ROUTE_FILTER_TRANSLATED_v6) will
   override the default filters sent with ROUTE_FILTER_v4 or
   ROUTE_FILTER_TRANSLATED_v4 for the VPNv6 AFI when support for the AF
   specific communities exists.


5.  Deployment Considerations

   When both the legacy PE and the RR support extended community based
   Outbound Route Filtering as in
   [I-D.draft-chen-bgp-ext-community-orf-00] this may be used as a
   alternate solution for the legacy PE to signal RT membership
   information, in order to realize the same benefits as [RFC4684].
   Also extended community ORF can be used amongst the RRs in lieu of
   [RFC4684] to realize similar benefits.
