This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
In particular, it defines objects for managing remote network
monitoring (RMON) devices for use on high speed networks.  This
document contains a MIB Module that defines these new objects and also
contains definitions of some updated objects from the RMON-MIB in RFC
2819 and the RMON2-MIB in RFC 2021.

Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.
