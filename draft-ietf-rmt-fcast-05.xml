    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <!-- ==================================== -->

      <t>This document introduces the FCAST reliable and scalable object
      (e.g., file) delivery application. Two variants of FCAST exist: <list
          style="symbols">
          <t>FCAST/ALC that relies on the Asynchronous Layer Coding (ALC)
          <xref target="RFC5775"></xref> and the Layered Coding Transport
          (LCT) <xref target="RFC5651"></xref> reliable multicast transport
          protocol, and</t>

          <t>FCAST/NORM that relies on the NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast
          (NORM) <xref target="RFC5740"></xref> reliable multicast
          transport protocol.</t>
        </list> Hereafter, the term FCAST denotes either FCAST/ALC or
      FCAST/NORM.
      FCAST is not a new protocol specification per se. Instead it is a set
      of data format specifications and instructions on how to use ALC and
      NORM to implement a file-casting service.</t>

      <t>A design goal behind FCAST is to define a streamlined solution, in
      order to enable lightweight implementations of the protocol stack, and
      limit the operational processing and storage requirements. A consequence
      of this choice is that FCAST cannot be considered as a versatile
      application, capable of addressing all the possible use-cases. On the
      contrary, FCAST has some intrinsic limitations. From this point of view
      it differs from FLUTE <xref target="RMT-FLUTE"></xref> which favors
      flexibility at the expense of some additional complexity.</t>

      <t>A good example of the design choices meant to favor simplicity is
      the way FCAST manages the object meta-data: by default, the meta-data
      and the object content are sent together, in a compound object. This
      solution has many advantages in terms of simplicity as will be described
      later on. However this solution has an intrinsic limitation since it
      does not enable a receiver to decide in advance, before beginning the
      reception of the compound object, whether the object is of interest or
      not, based on the information that may be provided in the meta-data.
      Therefore this document discusses additional techniques that may be used
      to mitigate this limitation.
      When use-cases require that each receiver download the whole set of
      objects sent in the session (e.g., with mirroring tools), this
      limitation is not considered a problem.

        <t>In an FCAST session, Compound Objects are constructed by prepending

        before the original object data content (see <xref target="meta-data_tx"/>).

        <t>The Compound Object Header fields are:</t>

          <ttcol align="right" width="15%">Field</ttcol>

          <ttcol align="left">Description</ttcol>

          <c>Version</c>

          <c>2-bit field that MUST be set to 0 in this specification and indicates
          the protocol version number.</c>

          <c>Reserved</c>

          <c>4-bit field that MUST be set to 0 in this specification and is reserved for
          future use. Receivers MUST ignore this field.</c>

          <c>G</c>

          <c>1-bit field that, when set to 1, indicates that the checksum
          encompasses the whole Compound Object (Global checksum). When set to
          0, this field indicates that the checksum encompasses only the
          Compound Object header.</c>

          <c>C</c>

          <c>1-bit field that, when set to 1, indicates the object is a
          Carousel Instance Descriptor (CID). When set to 0, this field indicates
          that the transported object is a standard object.</c>

          <c>Meta-Data Format (MDFmt)</c>

          <c>4-bit field that defines the format of the object meta-data (see
          <xref target="iana"></xref>). An HTTP/1.1 metainformation format
          <xref target="RFC2616"></xref> MUST be supported and is associated
          to value 0. Other formats (e.g., XML) MAY be defined in the
          future.</c>

          <c>Meta-Data Encoding (MDEnc)</c>

          <c>4-bit field that defines the optional encoding of the Object
          Meta-Data field (see <xref target="iana"></xref>). By default, a
          plain text encoding is used and is associated to value 0. GZIP
          encoding MUST also be supported and is associated to value 1. Other
          encodings MAY be defined in the future.</c>

          <c>Checksum</c>

          <c>16-bit field that contains the checksum computed over either the
          whole Compound Object (when G is set to 1), or over the Compound
          Object header (when G is set to 0), using the Internet checksum
          algorithm specified in <xref target="RFC1071"/>.
          More precisely, the checksum field is the 16-bit
          one's complement of the one's complement sum of all 16-bit words to
          be considered. If a segment contains an odd number of octets to be
          checksummed, the last octet is padded on the right with zeros to
          form a 16-bit word for checksum purposes (this pad is not
          transmitted). While computing the checksum, the checksum field
          itself is set to zero.</c>

          <c>Compound Object Header Length</c>

          <c>32-bit field indicating total length (in bytes) of all fields of
          the Compound Object Header, except the optional padding. A header
          length field set to value 8 means that there is no meta-data
          included. When this size is not multiple to 32-bits words and when
          the Compound Object Header is followed by a non null Compound Object Data,
          padding MUST be added. It should be noted that the meta-data field maximum
          size is equal to (2^32 - 8) bytes.</c>

          <c>Object Meta-Data</c>

          <c>Variable length field that contains the meta-data
          associated to the object.
          The format and encoding of this field are defined respectively by the
          MDFmt and MDEnc fields.
          With the default HTTP/1.1 format and plain text encoding, the Meta-Data
          is NULL-terminated plain text that follows the "TYPE" ":" "VALUE" "&lt;CR-LF&gt;"
          format used in HTTP/1.1 for metainformation <xref target="RFC2616"></xref>.
          The various meta-data items can appear in any order. The associated
          string, when non empty, MUST be NULL-terminated. When no meta-data
          is communicated, this field MUST be empty and the
          Compound Object Header Length MUST be equal to 8.</c>

          <c>Padding</c>

          <c>Optional, variable length field of zero-value bytes to align the
          start of the Object Data to 32-bit boundary. Padding is only
          used when the Compound Object Header Length value, in bytes, is not
          multiple of 4 and when the Compound Object Header is followed by
          non null Compound Object Data.</c>
        </texttable>

        <t>The Compound Object Header is then followed by the Object Data,
        i.e., the original object possibly encoded by FCAST. Note that the
        length of this content is the transported object length (e.g., as
        specified by the FEC OTI) minus the Compound Object Header Length
        and optional padding if any.</t>

        <t>Because the CID is transmitted as a special Compound Object, the
        following CID-specific meta-data entries are defined: <list
            style="symbols">
            <t>Fcast-CID-Complete: when set to 1, it indicates that no new
            object in addition to the ones whose TOI are specified in this
            CID, or the ones that have been specified in the previous CID(s),
            will be sent in the future. Otherwise it MUST be set to 0. This
            entry is optional. If absent, a receiver MUST conclude that the
            session is complete.</t>

            <t>Fcast-CID-ID: this entry contains the Carousel Instance IDentifier,
            or CIID.
            It starts from 0 and is incremented by 1 for each new carousel
            instance. This entry is optional if the FCAST session consists of
            a single, complete, carousel instance. In all other cases, this
            entry MUST be defined. In particular, the CIID is used by the TOI
            equivalence mechanism thanks to which any object is uniquely
            identified, even if the TOI is updated (e.g., after re-enqueuing
            the object with NORM). The Fcast-CID-ID value can also be useful
            to detect possible gaps in the Carousel Instances, for instance
            caused by long disconnection periods. Finally, it can also be
            useful to avoid problems when TOI wrapping to 0 takes place to
            differentiate the various incarnations of the TOIs if need be.</t>
          </list>
        The motivation for making the Fcast-CID-Complete and
        Fcast-CID-ID entries optional is to simplify the simple case of
        a session consisting of a single, complete, carousel instance, with
        an Object List given in plain text, without any content encoding.
        In that case, the CID does not need to contain any meta-data entry.</t>

        <t>Additionally, the following standard meta-data entries are often
        used (<xref target="meta-data_content"></xref>): <list style="symbols">
            <t>Content-Length: it specifies the size of the object list,
            before any content encoding (if any).</t>

            <t>Content-Encoding: it specifies the optional encoding of the
            object list, performed by FCAST. For instance: <figure>
                <artwork align="left"><![CDATA[        Content-Encoding: gzip  ]]></artwork>
              </figure> indicates that the Object List field has been encoded
            with GZIP <xref target="RFC1952"/>. If there is no
            Content-Encoding entry, the receiver MUST assume that the Object
            List field is plain text (default). The support of GZIP encoding,
            or any other solution, remains optional.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>An empty Object List is valid and indicates that the current
        carousel instance does not include any object (<xref
        target="cio"></xref>). This can be specified by using the following
        meta-data entry: <figure>
            <artwork align="left"><![CDATA[        Content-Length: 0  ]]></artwork>
          </figure> or simply by leaving the Object List empty. In both
        cases, padding MUST NOT be used and consequently the transported object
        length (e.g., as specified by the FEC OTI) minus the
        Compound Object Header Length equals zero.</t>

        <t>The non-encoded (i.e., plain text) Object List, when non empty, is
        a NULL-terminated ASCII string. It can contain two things: <list
            style="symbols">
            <t>a list of TOI values, and</t>

            <t>a list of TOI equivalences;</t>
          </list> First of all, this string can contain the list of TOIs
        included in the current carousel instance, specified either as the
        individual TOIs of each object, or as TOI intervals, or any
        combination. The format of the ASCII string is a comma-separated list
        of individual "TOI" values or "TOI_a-TOI_b" elements. This latter case
        means that all values between TOI_a and TOI_b, inclusive, are part of
        the list. In that case TOI_a MUST be strictly inferior to TOI_b. If a
        TOI wrapping to 0 occurs in an interval, then two TOI intervals MUST
        be specified, TOI_a-MAX_TOI and 0-TOI_b.</t>

        <t>This string can also contain the TOI equivalences, if any. The
        format is a comma-separated list of "(" newTOI "=" 1stTOI "/" 1stCIID
        ")" elements. Each element says that the new TOI, for the current
        Carousel Instance, is equivalent to (i.e., refers to the same object
        as) the provided identifier, 1stTOI, for the Carousel Instance of ID
        1stCIID.</t>

        <t>The ABNF specification is the following:</t>

        <figure>
          <artwork align="left"><![CDATA[cid-list   =  *(list-elem *( "," list-elem))
list-elem    =  toi-elem / toieq-elem
toi-elem     =  toi-value / toi-interval
toi-value    =  1*DIGIT
toi-interval =  toi-value "-" toi-value
                ; additionally, the first toi-value MUST be
                ; strictly inferior to the second toi-value
toieq-elem   =  "(" toi-value "=" toi-value "/" ciid-value ")"
ciid-value   = 1*DIGIT
DIGIT        =  %x30-39
                ; a digit between O and 9, inclusive]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>For readability purposes, it is RECOMMENDED that all the TOI values
        in the list be given in increasing order. However a receiver MUST be
        able to handle non-monotonically increasing values. It is also
        RECOMMENDED to group the TOI equivalence elements together, at the end
        of the list, in increasing newTOI order. However a receiver MUST be
        able to handle lists of mixed TOI and TOI equivalence elements.
        Specifying a TOI equivalence for a given newTOI relieves the sender
        from specifying newTOI explicitly in the TOI list. However a receiver
        MUST be able to handle situations where the same TOI appears both in
        the TOI value and TOI equivalence lists. Finally, a given TOI value or
        TOI equivalence item MUST NOT be included multiple times in either
        list.</t>

        <t>For instance, the following object list specifies that the current
        Carousel Instance is composed of 8 objects, and that TOIs 100 to 104
        are equivalent to the TOIs 10 to 14 of Carousel Instance ID 2 and
        refer to the same objects:</t>

      <t>This section details the principles of FCAST.</t>

      <section anchor="fcast_service" title="FCAST Content Delivery Service">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>The basic goal of FCAST is to transmit objects to a group of
        receivers in a reliable way, where the receiver set may be restricted to a
        single receiver or may include possibly a very large number of
        receivers. FCAST supports two forms of operation:
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>FCAST/ALC, where the FCAST application works on top
            of the ALC/LCT reliable multicast transport protocol, without
	    any feedback from the receivers, and</t>

            <t>FCAST/NORM, where the FCAST application works on top
            of the NORM reliable multicast transport protocol, that
	    requires positive/negative acknowledgements from the receivers.</t>
          </list></t>
        <t>This specification is designed such that both forms of operation
        share as much commonality as possible.
        <xref target="op_considerations"/> discusses some operational aspects and the content
        delivery service that is provided by FCAST for a given use-case.</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="meta-data_tx" title="Meta-Data Transmission">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>FCAST carries meta-data elements by prepending them to the
        object they refer to. As a result, a Compound Object is created that is
        composed of a header followed by the original object data. This
        header is itself composed of the meta-data as well as several fields,
        for instance to indicate the boundaries between the various parts of
        this Compound Object (<xref target="fig_compound_obj"></xref>).</t>

        <figure anchor="fig_compound_obj" title="Compound Object composition.">
          <artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
<------------------------ Compound Object ----------------------->
+-------------------------+--------------------------------------+

| (can include meta-data) |       (can be encoded by FCAST)      |
+-------------------------+--------------------------------------+
]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>Attaching the meta-data to the object is an efficient solution,
        since it guaranties that meta-data are received along with the
        associated object, and it allows the transport of the meta-data to
        benefit from any transport-layer erasure protection of the Compound
        Object (e.g., using FEC encoding and/or NACK-based repair). However a
        limit of this scheme is that a client does not know the
        meta-data of an object before beginning its reception, and in case of
        erasures affecting the meta-data, not until the object decoding is
        completed. The details of course depend upon the transport protocol
        and the FEC code used.</t>

	<t>
	<xref target="annex_add_meta_data_tx_mechanisms"/> describes extensions
	that provide additional means to carry meta-data, e.g., to communicate
	meta-data ahead of time.

      </section>

      <section anchor="meta-data_content" title="Meta-Data Content">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>A compliant FCAST implementation MUST support at least the following items:
        <list style="symbols">
            <t>Content-Location: the URI of the object, which gives the name
            and location of the object;</t>

            <t>Content-Type: a string that contains the MIME type of the object;</t>

            <t>Content-Length: an unsigned 64-bit integer that contains the size of the
            initial object, before any content encoding (if any) and without considering
            the Compound Object header.
            Note that the use of certain FEC schemes MAY further limit the maximum value
            of the object;</t>

            <t>Content-Encoding: a string that contains the optional encoding
            of the object performed by FCAST.
            If there is no Content-Encoding entry, the receiver MUST
            assume that the object is not encoded (default). The support of
            GZIP encoding, or any other solution, remains optional.</t>

            <t>Content-MD5: a binary content coded as "base64" that contains
            the MD5 message digest of the object in order to check its integrity.
            This digest is meant to protect from transmission and processing errors, not from
            deliberate attacks by an intelligent attacker (see <xref target="security"/>).
            This digest only protects the object, not the header, and therefore not the
            meta-data. A separate checksum is provided to that purpose (<xref
            target="compound_obj_format"></xref>);</t>

            <!-- <t>a digital signature for this object;</t> -->
        </list></t>

        <t>This list is not limited and new meta-data information can be
        added. For instance, when dealing with very large objects (e.g., that
        largely exceed the working memory of a receiver), it can be
        interesting to split this object into several sub-objects (or slices).
        When this happens, the meta-data associated to each sub-object MUST
        include the following entries: <list style="symbols">
            <t>Fcast-Obj-Slice-Nb: an unsigned 32-bit integer that contains the total
            number of slices. A value greater than 1 indicates that this object is the
            result of a split of the original object;</t>

            <t>Fcast-Obj-Slice-Idx: an unsigned 32-bit integer that contains the
            slice index (in the {0 .. SliceNb - 1} interval);</t>

            <t>Fcast-Obj-Slice-Offset: an unsigned 64-bit integer that contains
            the offset at which this slice starts within the original object;</t>
          </list></t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="carousel" title="Carousel Transmission">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>A set of FCAST Compound Objects scheduled for transmission are
        considered a logical "Carousel". A given "Carousel Instance" is
        comprised of a fixed set of Compound Objects. Whenever the FCAST
        application needs to add new Compound Objects to, or remove old
        Compound Objects from the transmission set, a new Carousel Instance is
        defined since the set of Compound Objects changes.
        Because of the native object multiplexing capability of both ALC and NORM,
        sender and receiver(s) are both capable to multiplex and demultiplex
        FCAST Compound Objects.</t>

        <t>For a given Carousel Instance, one or more transmission cycles are
        possible. During each cycle, all of the Compound Objects comprising
        the Carousel are sent. By default, each object is transmitted once per
        cycle. However, in order to allow different levels of priority, some
        objects MAY be transmitted more often that others during a cycle,
        and/or benefit from higher FEC protection than others. This can be the
        case for instance for the CID objects (<xref target="cio"></xref>). For
        some FCAST usage (e.g., a unidirectional "push" mode), a Carousel
        Instance may be associated to a single transmission cycle. In other
        cases it may be associated to a large number of transmission cycles
        (e.g., in "on-demand" mode, where objects are made available for
        download during a long period of time).</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="cio" title="Carousel Instance Descriptor Special Object">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>The FCAST sender CAN transmit an OPTIONAL Carousel Instance Descriptor
        (CID). The CID carries the list of the Compound Objects that are part
        of a given Carousel Instance, by specifying their respective
        Transmission Object Identifiers (TOI). However the CID does not
        describe the objects themselves (i.e., there is no meta-data).
        Additionally, the CID MAY include a "Complete" flag that is used to
        indicate that no further modification to the enclosed list will be
        done in the future. Finally, the CID MAY include a Carousel Instance
        ID that identifies the Carousel Instance it pertains to. These aspects
        are discussed in <xref target="carousel_instance_descr"></xref>.</t>

        <t>There is no reserved TOI value for the CID Compound Object itself, since
        this special object is regarded by ALC/LCT or NORM as a standard object.
        On the contrary, the nature of this object (CID) is indicated by means of a
        specific Compound Object header field (the "I" flag) so that it can be
        recognized and processed by the FCAST application as needed. A direct
        consequence is the following: since a receiver does not know in
        advance which TOI will be used for the following CID (in case of a
        dynamic session), he MUST NOT filter out packets that are not in the
        current CID's TOI list. Said differently, the goal of CID is not to
        setup ALC or NORM packet filters (this mechanism would not be secure
        in any case).</t>

        <t>The use of a CID remains OPTIONAL. If it is not used, then the
        clients progressively learn what files are part of the carousel
        instance by receiving ALC or NORM packets with new TOIs. However using
        a CID has several benefits: <list style="symbols">
            <t>When the "Complete" flag is set (if ever), the receivers know
            when they can leave the session, i.e., when they have received all
            the objects that are part of the last carousel instance of this
            delivery session;</t>

            <t>In case of a session with a dynamic set of objects, the sender
            can reliably inform the receivers that some objects have been
            removed from the carousel with the CID. This solution is more
            robust than the "Close Object flag (B)" of ALC/LCT since a client
            with an intermittent connectivity might loose all the packets
            containing this B flag. And while NORM provides a robust object
            cancellation mechanism in the form of its NORM_CMD(SQUELCH)
            message in response to receiver NACK repair requests, the use of
            the CID provides an additional means for receivers to learn of
            objects for which it is futile to request repair;</t>

            <t>The TOI equivalence (<xref target="object_id"></xref>) can be
            signaled with the CID. This is often preferable to the alternative
            solution where the equivalence is identified by examining the
            object meta-data, especially in case of erasures.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>During idle periods, when the carousel instance does not contain
        any object, a CID with an empty TOI list MAY be transmitted. In that
        case, a new carousel instance ID MUST be used to differentiate this
        (empty) carousel instance from the other ones. This mechanism can be
        useful to inform the receivers that:
        <list style="symbols">
            <t>all the previously sent objects have been removed from the
            carousel. It therefore improves the FCAST robustness even during
            "idle" period;</t>

            <t>the session is still active even if there is currently no
            content being sent. Said differently, it can be used as a
            heartbeat mechanism. If the "Complete" flag has not been set, it
            implicitly informs the receivers that new objects MAY be sent in
            the future;</t>
          </list></t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="object_id" title="Compound Object Identification">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>The FCAST Compound Objects are directly associated with the
        object-based transport service that the ALC and NORM protocols
        provide. In each of these protocols, the messages containing transport
        object content are labeled with a numeric transport object identifier
        (i.e., the ALC TOI and the NORM NormTransportId). For the purposes of
        this document, this identifier in either case (ALC or NORM) is
        referred to as the TOI.
        </t>

        <t>There are several differences between ALC and NORM: <list
            style="symbols">
            <t>the ALC use of TOI is rather flexible, since several TOI field
            sizes are possible (from 16 to 112 bits), since this size can be
            changed at any time, on a per-packet basis, and since the TOI
            management is totally free as long as each object is associated to
            a unique TOI (if no wraparound happened);</t>

            <t>the NORM use of TOI is more directive, since the TOI field is
            16 bit long and since TOIs MUST be managed sequentially;</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>In both NORM and ALC, it is possible that the transport
        identification space may eventually wrap for long-lived sessions
        (especially with NORM where this phenomenon is expected to happen more
        frequently). This can possibly introduce some ambiguity in FCAST
        object identification if a sender retains some older objects in newer
        Carousel Instances with updated object sets.
        <!-- Thus, when an updated
        object set, for a new Carousel Instance, would transport identifiers
        that exceed one-half of the TOI sequence space (or otherwise exceed
        the sender repair window capability in the case of NORM), it MAY be
        necessary to re-enqueue old objects within the Carousel with new TOI
        to stay within transport identifier limits. -->
        To avoid ambiguity the active TOIs (i.e., the TOIs corresponding to objects being
        transmitted) can only occupy half of the TOI sequence space. If an
        old object, whose TOI has fallen outside the current window, needs to
        be transmitted again, a new TOI must be used for it.
        In case of NORM, this
        constraint limits to 32768 the maximum number of objects that can be
        part of any carousel instance. In order to allow receivers to properly
        combine the transport packets with a newly-assigned TOI to those of
        associated to the previously-assigned TOI, a mechanism is required to
        equate the objects with the new and the old TOIs.</t>

        <t>The preferred mechanism consists in signaling, within the CID, that
        the newly assigned TOI, for the current Carousel Instance, is
        equivalent to the TOI used within a previous Carousel Instance. By
        convention, the reference tuple for any object is the {TOI; CI ID}
        tuple used for its first transmission within a Carousel Instance. This
        tuple MUST be used whenever a TOI equivalence is provided.</t>

        <t>An alternative solution, when meta-data can be processed rapidly
        (e.g., by using NORM-INFO messages), consists for the receiver in
        identifying that both objects are the same, after examining the
        meta-data. The receiver can then take appropriate measures.</t>

        operation.</t>

      <section anchor="norm_specifics"
               title="FCAST/NORM Additional Specificities">

        <t>The NORM Protocol provides a few additional capabilities that can
        be used to specifically support FCAST operation:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>The NORM_INFO message can convey "out-of-band" content with
            respect to a given transport object. With FCAST, it MAY be used to
            provide to the receivers a new, associated, Compound Object which
            contains the main Compound Object meta-data, or a subset of it.
            In that case the NORM_INFO Compound Object MUST NOT contain any
            Object Data field (i.e., it is only
            composed of the header), it MUST feature a non global checksum, and
            it MUST NOT include any padding field. The main Compound
            Object MUST in any case contain the whole meta-data (e.g., because
            a receiver MAY not support the NORM_INFO facility). Additionally, the
            meta-data entries contained in the NORM_INFO MUST be identical to
            the same entries in the main Compound Object. Finally, note that
            the availability of NORM_INFO for a given object is signaled
            through the use of a dedicated flag in the NORM_DATA message
            header. Along with NORM's NACK-based repair request signaling, it
            allows a receiver to quickly (and independently) request an
            object's NORM_INFO content. However, a limitation here is that the
            NORM_INFO Compound Object header MUST fit within the byte size
            limit defined by the NORM sender's configured "segment size"
            (typically a little less than the network MTU);</t>

            <t>The NORM_CMD(SQUELCH) messages are used by the NORM protocol
            sender to inform receivers of objects that have been canceled when
            receivers make repair requests for such invalid objects. Along
            with the CID mechanism, a receiver has two efficient and reliable
            ways to discover old objects that have been removed from the
            carousel instance;</t>

            <t>NORM also supports an optional positive acknowledgment
            mechanism that can be used for small-scale multicast receiver
            group sizes. Also, it may be possible in some cases for the sender
            to infer, after some period without receiving NACKs at the end of
            its transmission that the receiver set has fully received the
            transmitted content. In particular, if the sender completes its
            end-of-transmission series of NORM_CMD(FLUSH) messages without
            receiving repair requests from the group, it may have some
            assurance that the receiver set has received the content prior to
            that point. These mechanisms are likely to help FCAST in achieving
            fully reliable transmissions;</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>It should be noted that the NORM_INFO message header may carry
        the EXT_FTI extension. The reliable delivery of the NORM_INFO content
        allows the individual objects' FEC Transmission Information to be
        provided to the receivers without burdening every packet (i.e.
        NORM_DATA messages) with this additional, but important, content.

            <t>For each object, FCAST creates the Compound Object and
            registers this latter in the carousel instance;</t>

            <t>The user then informs FCAST that all the objects of the set
            have been submitted. If the user knows that no new object will be
            submitted in the future (i.e., if the session's content is now
            complete), the user informs FCAST. Finally, the user specifies how
            many transmission cycles are desired (this number may be
            infinite);</t>

            <t>At this point, the FCAST application knows the full list of
            Compound Objects that are part of the Carousel Instance and can
            create a CID if desired, possibly with the complete flag set;</t>

            <t>The FCAST application can now define a transmission schedule of
            these Compound Objects, including the optional CID. This schedule
            defines in which order the packets of the various Compound Objects
            should be sent. This document does not specify any scheme. This is
            left to the developer within the provisions of the underlying ALC
            or NORM protocol used and the knowledge of the target
            use-case.</t>

            <t>The FCAST application then starts the carousel transmission,
            for the number of cycles specified. Transmissions take place
            until: <list style="symbols">
                <t>the desired number of transmission cycles has been reached,
                or</t>

                <t>the user wants to prematurely stop the transmissions,
                or</t>

                <t>the user wants to add one or several new objects to the
                carousel, or on the contrary wants to remove old objects from
                the carousel. In that case a new carousel instance must be

        <t>The following operations MAY take place at a receiver: <list

            another mechanism prior to the object, the receiver processes the

            <t>When a Compound Object has been entirely received, the receiver

            <t>When a CID is received, which is indicated by the 'C' flag set

          <t>Access control to the object being transmitted is typically
          provided by means of encryption. This encryption can be done over
          the whole object (e.g., by the content provider, before submitting
          the object to FCAST), or be done on a packet per packet basis (e.g.,
          when IPsec/ESP is used <xref target="RFC4303"></xref>, see
          <xref target="min-sec-recommendations"/>).
          If confidentiality is a concern, it is RECOMMENDED that one of these
          solutions be used.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="obj_corruption" title="Object Corruption">
          <!-- ==================================== -->

          <t>Protection against corruptions (e.g., if an attacker sends forged
          packets) is achieved by means of a content integrity verification/sender
          authentication scheme. This service can be provided at the object
          level, but in that case a receiver has no way to identify which
          symbol(s) is(are) corrupted if the object is detected as corrupted.
          This service can also be provided at the packet level. In this case,
          after removing all corrupted packets, the file may be in some cases
          recovered. Several techniques can provide this content
          integrity/sender authentication service:
          <list style="symbols">
              <t>at the object level, the object can be digitally signed,
              for instance by using RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 <xref target="RFC3447"></xref>.
              This signature enables a receiver to check the object integrity, once this
              latter has been fully decoded. Even if digital signatures are
              computationally expensive, this calculation occurs only once per
              object, which is usually acceptable;</t>

              <t>at the packet level, each packet can be digitally signed <xref target="RMT-SIMPLE-AUTH"/>.
              A major limitation is the high computational and transmission
              overheads that this solution requires. To avoid this
              problem, the signature may span a set of packets (instead of a
              single one) in order to amortize the signature calculation. But
              if a single packets is missing, the integrity of the whole set
              cannot be checked;</t>

              <t>at the packet level, a Group Message Authentication Code
              (MAC) <xref target="RFC2104"></xref><xref target="RMT-SIMPLE-AUTH"/>
              scheme can be used, for
              instance by using HMAC-SHA-256 with a secret key shared by all the
              group members, senders and receivers. This technique creates a
              cryptographically secured digest of a packet that is sent along
              with the packet. The Group MAC scheme does not create
              prohibitive processing load nor transmission overhead, but it
              has a major limitation: it only provides a group
              authentication/integrity service since all group members share
              the same secret group key, which means that each member can send
              a forged packet. It is therefore restricted to situations where
              group members are fully trusted (or in association with another
              technique as a pre-check);</t>

              <t>at the packet level, Timed Efficient Stream Loss-Tolerant
              Authentication (TESLA) <xref target="RFC4082"/><xref target="RFC5776"/>
              is an attractive solution that is robust to losses, provides a true
              authentication/integrity service, and does not create any
              prohibitive processing load or transmission overhead. Yet
              checking a packet requires a small delay (a second or more)
              after its reception;</t>

              <t> at the packet level, IPsec/ESP <xref target="RFC4303"/>
              can be used to check the integrity and authenticate the sender
              of all the packets being exchanged in a session
              (see <xref target="min-sec-recommendations"/>).</t> 
            </list></t>

          <t>Techniques relying on public key cryptography (digital signatures
          and TESLA during the bootstrap process, when used) require that
          public keys be securely associated to the entities. This can be
          achieved by a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), or by a PGP Web of
          Trust, or by pre-distributing securely the public keys of each group
          member.</t>

          <t>Techniques relying on symmetric key cryptography (Group MAC)
          require that a secret key be shared by all group members. This can
          be achieved by means of a group key management protocol, or simply
          by pre-distributing securely the secret key (but this manual
          solution has many limitations).</t>

          <t>It is up to the developer and deployer, who know the security
          requirements and features of the target application area, to define
          which solution is the most appropriate. In any case, whenever there
          is any concern of the threat of file corruption, it is RECOMMENDED
          that at least one of these techniques be used.</t>

            for instance the multiple rate congestion control protocol.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The consequences of these attacks are potentially serious, since
        they can compromise the behavior of content delivery system or even
        compromise the network itself.</t>

        <section anchor="attack_against_sdp"
                 title="Attacks Against the Session Description">
          <!-- ==================================== -->

          <t>An FCAST receiver may potentially obtain an incorrect Session
          Description for the session. The consequence of this is that
          legitimate receivers with the wrong Session Description are unable
          to correctly receive the session content, or that receivers
          inadvertently try to receive at a much higher rate than they are
          capable of, thereby possibly disrupting other traffic in the
          network.</t>

          <t>To avoid these problems, it is RECOMMENDED that measures be taken
          to prevent receivers from accepting incorrect Session Descriptions.
          One such measure is the sender authentication to ensure that
          receivers only accept legitimate Session Descriptions from
          authorized senders. How these measures are achieved is outside the
          scope of this document since this session description is usually

          make the receivers believe that no further modification will be
          done.</t>

          <t>It is therefore RECOMMENDED that measures be taken to guarantee

          either be applied on a packet level, or globally over the whole CID

          <!-- ==================================== -->

          <t>Corrupting the object meta-data is another way to create a Denial
          of Service attack. For example, the attacker changes the MD5 sum
          associated to a file. This possibly leads a receiver to reject the
          files received, no matter whether the files have been correctly
          received or not. When the meta-data are appended to the object,
          corrupting the meta-data means that the Compound Object will be
          corrupted.</t>

          <t>It is therefore RECOMMENDED that measures be taken to guarantee
          the integrity and to check the sender's identity of the Compound

          <!-- ==================================== -->

          <t>By corrupting the ALC/LCT header (or header extensions) one can
          execute attacks on the underlying ALC/LCT implementation. For
          example, sending forged ALC packets with the Close Session flag (A)
          set to one can lead the receiver to prematurely close the session.
          Similarly, sending forged ALC packets with the Close Object flag (B)

          of an object. The same comments can be made for NORM.</t>

          <t>It is therefore RECOMMENDED that measures be taken to guarantee
          the integrity and to check the sender's identity of each ALC or NORM
          packet received. To that purpose, one of the counter-measures

        <section anchor="attack_against_bb"
                 title="Attacks Against the Associated Building Blocks">
          <!-- ==================================== -->

          <t>Let us first focus on the congestion control building block that
          may be used in an ALC or NORM session. A receiver with an incorrect
          or corrupted implementation of the multiple rate congestion control
          building block may affect the health of the network in the path
          between the sender and the receiver. That may also affect the
          reception rates of other receivers who joined the session.</t>

          <t>When congestion control is applied with FCAST, it is therefore
          RECOMMENDED that receivers be required to identify themselves as
          legitimate before they receive the Session Description needed to
          join the session. If authenticating a receiver does not prevent this
          latter to launch an attack, it will enable the network operator to
          identify him and to take counter-measures. This authentication can
          be made either toward the network operator or the session sender (or
          a representative of the sender) in case of NORM. The details of how
          it is done are outside the scope of this document.</t>

          <t>When congestion control is applied with FCAST, it is also
          RECOMMENDED that a packet level authentication scheme be used, as
          explained in <xref target="obj_corruption"></xref>. Some of them,
          like TESLA, only provide a delayed authentication service, whereas
          congestion control requires a rapid reaction. It is therefore
          RECOMMENDED <xref target="RFC5775"></xref> that a receiver using
          TESLA quickly reduces its subscription level when the receiver
          believes that a congestion did occur, even if the packet has not yet
          been authenticated. Therefore TESLA will not prevent DoS attacks
          where an attacker makes the receiver believe that a congestion
          occurred. This is an issue for the receiver, but this will not
          compromise the network.
          Other authentication methods that do not feature this delayed
          authentication could be preferred, or a group MAC scheme could be
          used in parallel to TESLA to prevent attacks launched from outside
          of the group.</t>

        builds on those specifications. In addition, any security
        considerations that apply to any congestion control building block
        used in conjunction with FCAST also applies to FCAST. Finally, the

      </section>


      <section anchor='min-sec-recommendations' title='Minimum Security Recommendations'>
        <!-- ==================================== -->

	  <t>
	  We now introduce a mandatory to implement but not necessarily to use security configuration,
	  in the sense of <xref target="RFC3365"/>.
	  Since FCAST/ALC relies on ALC/LCT, it inherits the "baseline secure ALC operation" of <xref target="RFC5775"/>.
	  Similarly, since FCAST/NORM relies on NORM, it inherits the "baseline secure NORM operation" of <xref target="RFC5740"/>.
	  More precisely, in both cases security is achieved by means of IPsec/ESP in transport mode.
	  <xref target='RFC4303'/> explains that ESP can be used to potentially provide confidentiality, data origin
	  authentication, content integrity, anti-replay and (limited) traffic flow confidentiality.
	  <xref target="RFC5775"/> specifies that the data origin authentication, content integrity and
	  anti-replay services SHALL be used, and that the confidentiality service is RECOMMENDED.
	  If a short lived session MAY rely on manual keying, it is also RECOMMENDED that an automated key management
	  scheme be used, especially in case of long lived sessions.
	  </t>

	  <t>
	  Therefore, the RECOMMENDED solution for FCAST provides per-packet security, with data origin
	  authentication, integrity verification and anti-replay.
	  This is sufficient to prevent most of the in-band attacks listed above.
	  If confidentiality is required, a per-packet encryption SHOULD also be used.

      <section title="Requirements Related to the Carousel Instance Descriptor (CID) Mechanism">
      <!-- ==================================== -->

	<t>
        Any compliant FCAST implementation MUST support the CID mechanism, in order to list the Compound Objects
        that are part of a given Carousel Instance.
        However its use is OPTIONAL.

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

    <section anchor="op_considerations" title="Operational Considerations">
      <!-- ==================================== -->

      <t>FCAST is compatible with any congestion control protocol designed
      for ALC/LCT or NORM. However, depending on the use-case, the data flow
      generated by the FCAST application might not be constant, but instead
      be bursty in nature. Similarly, depending on the use-case, an FCAST
      session might be very short. Whether and how this will impact the
      congestion control protocol is out of the scope of the present
      document.</t>

      <t>FCAST is compatible with any security mechanism designed for
      ALC/LCT or NORM. The use of a security scheme is strongly RECOMMENDED
      (see <xref target="security"></xref>).</t>

      <t>FCAST is compatible with any FEC scheme designed for ALC/LCT or
      NORM. Whether FEC is used or not, and the kind of FEC scheme used, is
      to some extent transparent to FCAST.</t>

      <t>FCAST is compatible with both IPv4 and IPv6. Nothing in the FCAST
      specification has any implication on the source or destination IP
      address type.</t>

      <!-- 
      <t>Depending on the target use case, the delivery service provided by
      FCAST is more or less reliable. For instance, with FCAST/ALC used in
      ON-DEMAND mode over a time period that largely exceeds the typical
      download time, the service can be considered as fully reliable.
      Similarly, when FCAST is used along with a session control application
      that collects reception information and takes appropriate corrective
      measures (e.g., a direct point-to-point retransmission of missing
      packets, or a new multicast recovery session), then the service can be
      considered as fully reliable. On the contrary, if FCAST operates in PUSH
      mode, then the service is usually only partially reliable, and a
      receiver that is disconnected for a sufficient time will perhaps not
      have the possibility to download the object(s).</t>
      -->

      <t>The delivery service provided by FCAST might be fully
      reliable, or only partially reliable depending upon:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>the way ALC or NORM is used (e.g., whether FEC encoding and/or
           NACK-based repair requests are used or not),</t>
        <t>the way the FCAST carousel is used (e.g., whether the objects
           are made available for a long time span or not), and</t>
        <t>the way in which FCAST itself is employed (e.g., whether there is
           a session control application that might automatically extend an
           existing FCAST session until all receivers have received the
           transmitted content).</t>
      </list></t>

      <t> The receiver set MAY be restricted to a single receiver or MAY include
      possibly a very large number of receivers.
      While the choice of the underlying transport protocol (i.e., ALC or
      NORM) and its parameters may limit the practical receiver group size,
      nothing in FCAST itself limits it.
      For instance, if FCAST/ALC is used on top of purely
      unidirectional transport channels, with no feedback information at all,
      which is the default mode of operation, then the scalability is maximum
      since neither FCAST, nor ALC, UDP or IP generates any feedback message.
      On the contrary, the FCAST/NORM scalability is typically limited by NORM
      scalability itself. Similarly, if FCAST is used along with a session
      control application that collects reception information from the
      receivers, then this session control application may limit the
      scalability of the global object delivery system. This situation can of
      course be mitigated by using a hierarchy of feedback message aggregators
      or servers. The details of this are out of the scope of the present
      document.</t>

      <t> The content of a carousel instance MAY be described by means of
      an OPTIONAL Carousel Instance Descriptor (CID) (<xref target="cio"/>).
      The decisions of whether a CID should be used or not, how often and
      when a CID should be sent, are left to the sender and depend on many
      parameters, including the target use case and the session dynamics.
      For instance it may be appropriate to send a CID at the beginning of
      each new carousel instance, and then periodically. These operational
      aspects are out of the scope of the present document.</t>

        <t>There are therefore a total of 3+5+4+1 = 13 objects in the carousel
        instance, and therefore in the FCAST session. There is no meta-data
        associated to this CID. The session being static and composed of a
        single Carousel Instance, the sender did not feel the necessity to
        carry a Carousel Instance ID meta-data.</t>

      <section title="Supporting Additional Mechanisms">
      <!-- ==================================== -->

      <t>In certain use-cases, FCAST MAY take advantage of another
      in-band (e.g., via NORM INFO messages <xref target="norm_specifics"/>) or out-of-band
      signaling mechanism.
      This additional signaling scheme MAY be used to carry the whole meta-data,
      or a subset of it, ahead of time, before the associated compound object.
      Therefore a receiver may be able to decide in advance, before beginning
      the reception of the compound object, whether the object is of interest
      or not, based on the information retrieved by this way, which mitigates
      FCAST limitations.
      If out-of-band techniques are out of the scope of this document, we
      explain below how this may be achieved in case of FCAST/NORM.
      </t>

      <t>
      Supporting one of these additional mechanisms is OPTIONAL in FCAST implementations.
      An FCAST/NORM sender MUST continue to send all the required meta-data in
      the compound object, even if the whole meta-data, or a subset of it, is sent by
      another mechanism (<xref target="compliance_requirements"/>).
      Additionally, when meta-data is sent several times, there MUST NOT be
      any contradiction in the information provided by the different mechanisms.
      In case a mismatch is detected, the meta-data contained in the Compound
      Object MUST be privileged.
      </t>

      <t>When meta-data elements are communicated out-of-band, in advance of
      data transmission, the following piece of information MAY be useful:
      <list style="symbols">
          <t>TOI: a positive integer that contains the Transmission Object Identifier
            (TOI) of the object, in order to enable a receiver to easily associate the
            meta-data to the object.
            The valid range for TOI values is discussed in <xref target="object_id"></xref>;
          </t>

      <section anchor="norm_specifics" title="Using NORM_INFO Messages with FCAST/NORM">
      <!-- ==================================== -->

        <t>The NORM_INFO message of NORM can convey "out-of-band" content with
        respect to a given transport object.
        With FCAST, this message MAY be used as an additional mechanism to
        transmit meta-data.
	In that case, the NORM_INFO message carries a new Compound Object that
        contains all the meta-data of the original object, or a subset of it.
        The NORM_INFO Compound Object MUST NOT contain any Object Data field (i.e., it is only
        composed of the header), it MUST feature a non global checksum, and
        it MUST NOT include any padding field.
        <!--
        The main Compound
        Object MUST in any case contain the whole meta-data (e.g., because
        a receiver MAY not support the NORM_INFO facility). Additionally, the
        meta-data entries contained in the NORM_INFO MUST be identical to
        the same entries in the main Compound Object.
        -->
        Finally, note that
        the availability of NORM_INFO for a given object is signaled
        through the use of a dedicated flag in the NORM_DATA message
        header. Along with NORM's NACK-based repair request signaling, it
        allows a receiver to quickly (and independently) request an
        object's NORM_INFO content. However, a limitation here is that the
        NORM_INFO Compound Object header MUST fit within the byte size
        limit defined by the NORM sender's configured "segment size"
        (typically a little less than the network MTU);</t>

        <section title="Example">
        <!-- ==================================== -->

          <t>In case of FCAST/NORM, the FCAST Compound Object meta-data
          (or a subset of it) can be carried as part of a NORM_INFO message,
          as a new Compound Object that does not contain any Compound Object
          Data. In the following example we assume that the whole meta-data
          is carried in such a message for a certain Compound Object. <xref
          target="expl_norm_info"></xref> shows an example NORM_INFO message
          that contains the FCAST Compound Object Header and meta-data as its
          payload. In this example, the first 16 bytes are the NORM_INFO base
          header, the next 12 bytes are a NORM EXT_FTI header extension
          containing the FEC Object Transport Information for the associated
          object, and the remaining bytes are the FCAST Compound Object Header
          and meta-data. Note that "padding" MUST NOT be used and that the
          FCAST checksum only encompasses the Compound Object Header (G=0).</t>

          <t>The NORM_INFO message shown in <xref
          target="expl_norm_info"></xref> contains the EXT_FTI header extension
          to carry the FEC OTI. In this example, the FEC OTI format is that of
          the Reed-Solomon FEC coding scheme for fec_id = 5 as described in
          <xref target="RFC5510"></xref>. Other alternatives for providing the
          FEC OTI would have been to either include it directly in the meta-data
          of the FCAST Compound Header, or to include an EXT_FTI header extension to
          all NORM_DATA packets (or a subset of them). Note that the NORM
          "Transfer_Length" is the total length of the associated FCAST Compound
          Object, i.e., 41 bytes.
          </t>

          <t>The FCAST Compound Object in this example does contain the same
          meta-data and is formatted as in the example of <xref
          target="expl_object"></xref>. With the combination of the FEC_OTI and
          the FCAST meta-data, the NORM protocol and FCAST application have all
          of the information needed to reliably receive and process the
          associated object. Indeed, the NORM protocol provides rapid (NORM_INFO has
          precedence over the associated object content), reliable delivery of
          the NORM_INFO message and its payload, the FCAST Compound Object.
