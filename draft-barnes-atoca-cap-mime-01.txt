1.  Introduction

   The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) [CAP] is an XML document format
   for exchanging emergency alerts and public warnings.  This document
   registers a media type for CAP documents.  The full specification for
   CAP can be found at the following URL:

   <http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/15135/
   emergency-CAPv1.1-Corrected_DOM.pdf>

   The following is an example of a CAP message for a severe
   thunderstorm warning:

2.  IANA Considerations

2.1.  Registration of the 'application/common-alerting-protocol+xml'
      media type

Internet-Draft            CAP MIME registration             October 2011


   To:   ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject:   Registration of media type application/cap+xml

   Type name:  application

   Subtype name:  cap+xml

   Required parameters:   (none)

   Optional parameters:   charset; Indicates the character encoding of
      the enclosed XML.  Default is UTF-8 [RFC3629].

   Encoding considerations:  Uses XML, which can employ 8-bit
      characters, depending on the character encoding used.  See RFC
      3023 [RFC3023], Section 3.2.

   Security considerations:   Transmission of CAP payloads does not
      introduce new security risks

   Interoperability considerations:   CAP is widely used for emergency
      management.

   Published specification:   RFC XXXX [Replace by the RFC number of
      this specification].

   Applications which use this media type:   Applications that convey
      alerts and early warnings according to the CAP standard.

   Additional information:

      Magic number:   (none)

      File extension:   .cap

      Macintosh file type code:   'TEXT'

   Person & email address to contact for further information:   Hannes
      Tschofenig, hannes.tschofenig@nsn.com

   Intended usage:   Limited use

   Restrictions on usage:   (none)

   Author:   The CAP format was originally standardized by OASIS [CAP].
      This document was developed by the IETF ATOCA working group.

   Change controller:   The IESG <iesg@ietf.org>

   Other information:   This media type is a specialization of
      application/xml [RFC3023], and many of the considerations
      described there also apply to application/cap+xml.


3.  Security Considerations

   The introduction of the CAP MIME type does not present any new risks
   in itself.  CAP messages are used to encode emergency alerts, which
   means that false CAP messages can have significant negative effects,
   such as the unnecessary evacuation of an area.  Systems that process
   CAP messages will need to have mechanisms for integrity protection
   and origin authentication, in order to ensure either that end alert
   recipients do not receive false alerts or that they can distinguish
   valid alerts from false alerts.
