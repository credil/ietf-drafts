Abstract

   Some countries and regions require location information be
   constrained to emergency service applications and do not permit
   location information to traverse the end-point at all.  This document
   describes the requirements of these countries and provides a solution
   based on an extension to the HELD location protocol.

Internet-Draft    Out of Jurisdiction Emergency Routing     October 2012


1.  Introduction and Motivation

   The Internet emergency calling architecture specified in
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp] describes two main models for emergency
   call processing.  The first is a device-centric model, where a device
   obtains location information using a location configuration protocol,
   such a HELD [RFC5985], and then proceeds to determine the address of
   the next hop closer to the local PSAP using LoST [RFC5222].  Figure 1
   shows this model in a simplified form.

        +---Location Request---+
        |         (1)          |
    +---+----+             +---V---+

       |   |                +--------V----+          ^
       |   +-----Service----| LoST Server |          |
       |         (4)        +-------------+      +---+---+
       +-------------Call Initiation------------>|  VSP  |
                        (5)                      +-------+


             Figure 1: Device-Centric Emergency Services Model

   With the ever increasing deployment of smart phones and tablet
   devices a variation of the device-centric model is the ability to use
   location available to the device for routing and then consult a LIS
   when location is needed for dispatch.  Location can come in various
   forms to the device, e.g., from GPS, third party location databases,
   as well as IP-to-geolocation services.

   The second approach is a softswitch-centric model, where a device
   initiates and emergency call and the serving softswitch detects that
   the call is an emergency and initiates retrieving the caller's
   location from a Location Information Server (LIS) using HELD
   [RFC5985] with identity extensions [RFC6155] and then determining the
   route to the local PSAP using LoST [RFC5222].  Figure 2 shows the
   high-level protocol interactions.

                             +-----------+       (6)


                Figure 2: Softswitch-Centric Calling Model

   In the softswitch-centric model when a VSP receives an emergency call
   it will encounter several difficulties.  The first hurdle is for the
   VSP to determine the correct LIS to ask for location information.
   Having obtained the location, the VSP must then determine the correct
   PSAP using a LoST server and this requires wide-spread deployment of
   forest guides.  This leads to a failure in the softswitch-centric
   approach to deliver emergency calls correctly because the VSP is
   unable to determine the correct PSAP to route the call to.  The
   softswitch-centric model should therefore seen only as a transition
   architecture towards the end-device model where end devices have not
   been upgraded.  Software updates of end devices are, however, not a
   problem anymore since software updates have to be provided to end
   devices on a regular basis to patch security vulnerabilities.  Any
   service provider that does not have an ability to update devices will
   not only put their own customers at risk but also other Internet
   users as well since those can become the victims of attacks as well.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terms LIS, ESRP, VSP and PSAP are used as defined in [RFC6443].



Winterbottom, et al.     Expires April 19, 2013                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    Out of Jurisdiction Emergency Routing     October 2012


   The term "Access Network Provider" is used as defined in [RFC5687]
   and incompasses both the Internet Access Provider (IAP) and Internet
   Service Provider (ISP).


3.  Problem Description

   There is a significant faction in the emergency services and the
   regulatory community that do not want to rely on emergency calls
   solutions with end-device provided location.  This includes location
   information that is determined by the network but subsequently
   traverses the end-point prior to being delivered to the emergency
   organization.

   There are two concerns:

   Security:  One concern is about the possibility of the software of
      the end device being able to tamper with location.  This can lead
      to denial of service attacks against the emergency services
      infrastructure.  [I-D.ietf-ecrit-trustworthy-location] describes
      these concerns in detail.

   Privacy:  There is the desire to allow location information to be
      provided to emergency organizations rather than any other party,
      including the end device or a VSP.  In the softswitch model the
      VSP would have to ask the access provider for location
      information.  However, the number of VSPs asking for location
      information could, at least in theory depending on the scope of
      emergency services regulation be very large and is likely to
      include VSPs that are located in a jurisdiction that is different
      from the one of the access network provider.  Allowing VSPs to ask
      for location information of end devices at access network
      providers in a third party fashion without the ability to present
      the user's consent or the emergency service nature calls for
      privacy problems.  [RFC6155] discusses some of these privacy
      challenges as part of the third party requests.

   These arguments may, however, also jacked into place to hide another
   reason, namely the desire to create an artifical relationship between
   the VSP and the access network provider.  [RFC6444] provides a
   problem description and [I-D.ietf-ecrit-rough-loc] even offers a
   solution based on rough location.  This solutions, however, requires
   the access network provider to compute these rough location shapes.
   Countries that have a large number of PSAPs and neither an ESRP nor a
   stage-1 PSAP architecture may encounter problems computing these
   shapes.

   The Internet calling model does not constrain the call to a single

   jurisdictional boundary nor does it assume that the Voice Service
   provider (VSP) role is provided by the access provider.  This allows
   the VSP to be located anywhere on the Internet without requiring any
   association with Internet access providers.

4.  Key Observations

   When these security and privacy requirements are taken into
   consideration then the emergency calling architecture and associated

Internet-Draft    Out of Jurisdiction Emergency Routing     October 2012


   procedures described in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp] and [RFC6443]
   require some adaptation in some configurations to ensure universal
   operation.  The softswitch model fails to meet the privacy
   requirements and the end-device model has to wrangle with security
   challenges.

   Several observations have been posed thus far:

   Problem#1:  Rough location information is required to route emergency
      calls.

   Problem#2:  The VSP needs the ability to determine the correct LIS to
      retrieve location information.

   Problem#3:  The VSP needs the ability to contact a LoST server to
      acquire routing information from.

   Problem#4:  The end host does not acquire or convey location to the
      emergency network.

   Problem#5:  Access network provider aim to provide location only to
      emergency service authorities.

   Problem#6:  Precise location information is required to dispatch
      first responders.


5.  Available Building Blocks

   To fulfill A number of building blocks are already available.  There
   is no need to start from a clean sheet.

   Location:  Location standards have existed for mobile cellular
      networks since the mid to late 1990s, and location standards for
      the Internet have existed since the mid to late 2000s.  The exact
      determination techniques for each access technology are different
      but the ability to direct communications across a communications
      network is inherenetly premised on being able to reach a specific
      device and this requires some knowledge of where the device is
      physically located.  The term Location Information Server (LIS) is
      used to identify the element in an access network responsible for
      providing the location of a device in its administrative domain.
      LIS service discovery techniques are described in [RFC5986] and
      [I-D.ietf-geopriv-res-gw-lis-discovery].

Internet-Draft    Out of Jurisdiction Emergency Routing     October 2012


   Call Routing:  The LoST protocol [RFC5222] specifies a means to map
      location and service information into a destination URI.  Next
      generation emergency services architectures and procedures, such
      as those defined in [RFC6443], NENA i3, and the EENA NG112
      document, use LoST for providing routing to local emergency
      service authorities.  LoST servers are discovered using DNS
      U-NAPTR [RFC4848] to obtain a service URI.  The discovered LoST
      server services the domain in which the device is resident, or is
      able to provide the identity of a LoST server that can service the
      request.  A access network provider that operates in an area
      capable of receiving next generation emergency calls is able to
      include a U-NAPTR record in their DNS servers that identifies the
      local serving LoST server able to resolve emergency routing
      requests.

   LIS Discovery:  [I-D.ietf-geopriv-res-gw-lis-discovery] provides a
      means for discovering a LIS based on the IP address of a device
      and this could be used in conjunction with [RFC6155] to provide a
      solution to problem 2.  The domain name discovered for the LIS
      could be reused to discover the correct LoST server to contact
      thereby solving problem 3.


6.  The Missing Link

   Problem 5 does not allow the LIS to provide location information
   except to emergency authorities, and while the HELD protocol
   [RFC5985] does allow a location URI to be returned to the requesting
   entitiy, the LoST protocol [RFC5222] requires a location value and
   does not support a location reference.

   One possible solution to problem 5 is to extend LoST to support a
   location URI in the findService request method.  In this case a VSP
   would detect that a device was making an emergency call, determine
   the correct LIS to contact using
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-res-gw-lis-discovery], contact the LIS using HELD
   [RFC5985] using the IP address of the calling device as an identity
   extension [RFC6155] and the LIS would respond with a location URI
   that requires client-side authentication for dereferencing Using the
   LIS domain identifier the VSP would then determine the correct LoST
   server and request emergency services using the location URI as the
   location reference.  The LoST server must have permission to
   dereference the location URI, if any form of recurision is
   encountered then the URI must be dereferenced multiple times
   increasing the likelihood of failure.

   An alternative approach is to leave LoST unchanged, but extend the
   HELD protocol and requirements of the local LIS.  In this solution,



Winterbottom, et al.     Expires April 19, 2013                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft    Out of Jurisdiction Emergency Routing     October 2012


   when the LIS receives the third-party request, it performs the
   necessary LoST request using the location of the device.  The LIS
   responds with a location URI and the destination URI of the correct
   emergency service authority.  The Location URI will only yield
   location information to the authorized emergency authority.  This
   solution addresses problem 1 problem 3, problem 4, problem 5.
   Problem 2 is solved using a combination of
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-res-gw-lis-discovery] and HELD with identity
   extensions.

6.1.  Call Flow

   1.  Device initiates an emergency call to the user's VSP

   2.  The VSP's proxy detects emergency call and uses IP address to
       determine the correct LIS to query using
       [I-D.ietf-geopriv-res-gw-lis-discovery].

   3.  The VSP queries the LIS using HELD and the IP address of the
       calling device as an identity extension.

   4.  The LIS determines the location and uses it request routing
       information for the local LoST server.

   5.  The LIS return a location URI and the local Emergency Service
       Routing Proxy (ESRP) URI to the VSP.

   6.  The VSP follows the guidance from [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp] and
       routes the call to the ESRP.

   7.  The ESRP authenticates itself with the LIS when it dereferences
       the location URI.

   8.  The returns location information to the ESRP allowing it route
       the call to the correct PSAP.

6.2.  Domain Breakdown

   The key advantage of the call flow show in Section 6.1 is that it
   separates the entities into two clear groups, those that are inside
   the regulatory emergency jurisdiction and those that are in the
   Internet.  This is evident in Figure 5.

7.  HELD Extensions to Support Emergency Routing Information

   Figure 4 shows the enhancements needed to support the new calling
   model.  If the LIS implements this specification then it responds as
   shown in Figure 4, otherwise it responds with standard HELD [RFC5985]
   [RFC6155] semantics.  Consequently, the locationRequest message is
   not modified.

   It is recommended that the location request include a responseTime of
   emergencyRouting to ensure that the LIS provides a response to the

   VSP as quickly as possible.

   When using IP related information to identify the UA to the LIS then
   the identity information MUST be expressed using the IP flow
   representation specified in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-flow-identity].  This
   minimizes any issues caused by address translation entities in the
   location path.

   A new optional "emergencyRoutingInformation" element containing the
   relevant destination URLs is added to the locationResponse message.
   The list of destination URLs provided MUST conform to the same
   contraints as the service URLs returned in the LoST protocol
   [RFC5222] in the findServiceResponse.  For clarity these constraints
   are repreated here:

   1.  The URLs MUST be absolute URLs

   2.  The ordering of the URLs has no particular significance

   3.  Each URL scheme MUST only appear at most once

   4.  It is permissible to include both secured and regular versions of
       a protocol

   This specification updates the switch-centric call model in
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp].  In addition to supporting the return of a
   location value or location URI set from the LIS, the VSP MUST support
   receiving only a location URI set and a set of URLs identifying the
   emergency service routing proxies associated with the UA's location.

7.1.  HELD Schema Extension

   This section describes the schema extension to HELD.
