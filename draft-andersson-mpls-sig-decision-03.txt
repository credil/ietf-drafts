This document documents the consensus reached by the Multiprotocol
Label Switching (MPLS) Working Group within the IETF to focus its
efforts on "Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)-TE: Extensions to
RSVP for Label-Switched Paths (LSP) Tunnels" (RFC 3209) as the MPLS
signalling protocol for traffic engineering applications and to
undertake no new efforts relating to "Constraint-Based LSP Setup using
Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)" (RFC 3212).  The recommendations of
section 6 have been accepted by the IESG.
