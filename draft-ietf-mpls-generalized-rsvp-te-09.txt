This document describes extensions to Multi-Protocol Label Switching
(MPLS) Resource ReserVation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)
signaling required to support Generalized MPLS.  Generalized MPLS
extends the MPLS control plane to encompass time-division (e.g.,
Synchronous Optical Network and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy,
SONET/SDH), wavelength (optical lambdas) and spatial switching (e.g.,
incoming port or fiber to outgoing port or fiber).  This document
presents a RSVP-TE specific description of the extensions.  A generic
functional description can be found in separate documents.

This document is a product of the Common Control and Measurement Plane
(ccamp) Working Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
