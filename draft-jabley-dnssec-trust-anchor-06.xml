    <abstract>
      <t>The root zone of the Domain Name System (DNS) has been
        cryptographically signed using DNS Security Extensions
        (DNSSEC).</t>

      <t>In order to obtain secure answers from the root zone of the
        DNS using DNSSEC, a client must configure a suitable trust
        anchor.  This document describes how such trust anchors are
        published.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Domain Name System (DNS) is described in <xref
    target="RFC1034" /> and <xref target="RFC1035" />. Security
    extensions to the DNS (DNSSEC) are described in <xref
    target="RFC4033" />, <xref target="RFC4034" />, <xref
    target="RFC4035" />, <xref target="RFC4509" />, <xref
    target="RFC5155" /> and <xref target="RFC5702" />.</t>

      <t>A discussion of operational practices relating to DNSSEC
        can be found in <xref target="RFC4641" />.</t>

      <t>In DNSSEC resource record sets (RRSets) are cryptographically-signed,
        such that a response to a query contains signatures which allow its
        integrity and authenticity to be verified. An individual signature is
        validated by following a chain of signatures to a key which is trusted
        for some extra-protocol reason.</t>

      <t>The publication of trust anchors for the root zone of the DNS is an
        IANA function performed by ICANN. A detailed description of
        corresponding key management practices can be found in <xref
        target="DPS"/>, which can be retrieved from the IANA Repository
        located at <eref target="https://www.iana.org/dnssec/"/>.</t>

      <t>This document describes the distribution of DNSSEC trust anchors.
        Whilst the data formats and the publication and retrieval methods
        described in this document might well be adapted for other uses, this
        document's focus is more specific and is concerned only with the
        distribution of trust anchors for the root zone.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Root Zone Trust Anchor Publication">

      <t>Trust anchors for the root zone are published in two formats,
        each of which is described in this document:

         <list style="symbols">

           <t>as the hashes of the corresponding DNSKEY records, consistent
             with the defined presentation format of Delegation Signer (DS)
             resource records <xref target="RFC4034"/>, contained within an
             XML document, as described in <xref target="xml"/>, and</t>

           <t>as Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) in PKCS#10 format <xref
             target="RFC2986"/> for further processing by Certification
             Authorities and validation of proof of possession of the
             corresponding private keys, as described in <xref
             target="pkcs10"/>.</t>

         </list>
       </t>

      <section title="XML" anchor="xml">

        <t>Trust anchors are published in an XML document whose schema is
          described in <xref target="schema" />. The document contains a
          complete set of trust anchors for the root zone, including anchors
          suitable for immediate use and also historical data. Each trust
          anchor optionally includes Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) for
          retrieving corresponding X.509 certificates.</t>

        <t>Examples of trust anchors packaged and signed for
          publication can be found in <xref target="examples" />.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Certificate Signing Request (PKCS#10)" anchor="pkcs10">

        <t>To facilitate signing the trust anchor by a public key
          infrastructure, trust anchors are also published as
          Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) in <xref
          target="RFC2986">PKCS#10 format</xref>.</t>

        <t>Each CSR will have a Subject with following attributes:

              e.g. "Root Zone KSK 2010-06-16T21:19:24+00:00".</t>

    <section title="Implementation Considerations">
      <t>Note: This non-normative section gives suggestions for
        implementing root zone trust anchor retrieval.</t>

      <t>Root trust anchor retrieval by the HTTP or HTTP over TLS
        transports has several implementation considerations to
        ensure robustness, usability and secure operation.</t>

      <section title="HTTP Over TLS Transport">
        <t>The HTTP over TLS transport <xref target="RFC2818"/> is suggested
          over the unencrypted HTTP transport <xref target="RFC2616"/> for
          implementations using the XML-format root trust anchors, since the
          latter transport does not provide authentication. It is not
          suggested that implementations restrict certification path
          validation of the HTTP over TLS transport session to the current or
          historical certificate authorities used by the root trust anchor
          server, since doing so would reduce robustness of the
          implementation. It is suggested that the implementation configure
          the HTTP over TLS transport library to validate the certification
          path against certificate revocation lists <xref target="RFC5280"/>,
          and reject self-signed certificates and certification paths that do
          not terminate in a trusted certificate authority.</t>

        <t>Implementations can allow configuration of the URL used
          to retrieve the root trust anchor resources, but it is
          suggested that the default configuration use the URLs
          specified in <xref target="HTTPOverTLS"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="XML Validation">
        <t>Implementations may perform strict validation of the
          retrieved XML document against the XML schema; however,
          such an implementation would not be robust against future
          changes in the XML schema. It is suggested that the
          implementation perform "loose" validation, where unknown
          attributes and elements are ignored. This suggestion
          allows for future additions to the XML schema without
          affecting existing implementations.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Trust Anchor Validation">
        <t>The implementation can ignore trust anchors for which
          the Algorithm or DigestType elements refer to an unknown,
          or unsupported algorithm. Additionally, trust anchors for
          which the Algorithm or DigestType elements refer to a
          deprecated algorithm can be ignored, provided that this
          suggestion does not cause all trust anchors to be
          ignored. Further, note that these suggestions may not
          apply where an implementation shares trust anchors
          between many DNS validating resolvers, since the set of
          supported algorithms may vary between resolvers, and
          could possibly be disjoint.</t>

        <t>The implementation can also ignore a trust anchor when
          the validUntil time, if present, is in the past. If the
          implementation also supports automated updates of trust
          anchors <xref target="RFC5011"/>, it can ignore trust
          anchors where the current time subtracted from the
          validFrom time, if present, is greater than the add-hold
          down time <xref target="RFC5011"/> for the trust
          point.</t>

        <t>The implementation can reject any trust anchor for a
        trust point other than the root zone.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>Key Signing Key (KSK) management for the root zone is an
        IANA function. This document describes an initial set of
        publication mechanisms for trust anchors related to that
        management. In the future, additional publication schemes
        may also be made available, in which case they will be
        described in a new document that updates this one.</t>

      <t>Existing mechanisms will not be deprecated without very
        strong technical justification.</t>

      <t>This document contains information about an existing
        service, and has no IANA actions.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document describes how DNSSEC trust anchors for the
        root zone of the DNS are published. It is to be expected
        that many DNSSEC clients will only configure a single trust
        anchor to perform validation, and that the trust anchor
        they use will be that of the root zone. As a consequence,
        reliable publication of trust anchors is important.</t>

      <t>This document aims to specify carefully the means by which
        such trust anchors are published, as an aid to the formats
        and retrieval methods described here being integrated
        usefully into user environments.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Acknowledgements">
      <t>Many pioneers paved the way for the deployment of DNSSEC
        in the root zone of the DNS, and the authors hereby acknowledge
        their substantial collective contribution.</t>

      <t>This document incorporates suggestions made by Paul Hoffman
        and Alfred Hoenes, whose contributions are appreciated.</t>

    <section title="Historical Note">
      <t>The first KSK for use in the root zone of the DNS was
    generated at a key ceremony at an ICANN Key Management Facility
    (KMF) in Culpeper, Virginia, USA on 2010-06-16.  This key
    entered production during a second key ceremony held at an
    ICANN KMF in El Segundo, California, USA on 2010-07-12.
    The resulting trust anchor was first published on 2010-07-15.</t>
