1.  Introduction

   The goal of this survey is to gather information from people who have
   implemented MPTCP, in particular to help progress the protocol from
   Experimental to Standards track.

   The MPTCP WG's current charter (2013-03-14) states: "The primary goal
   of the working group is to create a bis version of the protocol
   document on the Standards track.  This develops the current
   Experimental document ... incorporating experience from (for example)
   implementations, interoperability events, experiments, usage
   scenarios, protocol corner cases, and feedback from TCPM ... [Also,
   the] working group will document implementation advice.  The current
   documents have several points where an implementer may benefit from

   guidance, for example about heuristics such as buffer sizing, or from
   advice about alternative implementations such as bump-in-the-stack."

   The survey gathers relevant information to help this, for example
   about: the existence of running code (especially several independent,
   interoperable implementations); the parts of the experimental spec
   that have not been implemented (or not been used); the parts that
   need improvement, in terms of functionality or clarity.

   The survey also takes the opportunity to gather some limited
   information about operational experiences and deployments.

   The WG is very grateful to those implementers taking the trouble to
   fill in this survey - as well, of course, as their effort in creating
   the implementation!

   The intention is to produce a revised version of this draft that
   incorporates a summary of the replies and an appendix with all the
   full responses.

2.  Guidelines for filling in the survey

   Please could each implementation team fill in the survey.  If you
   cannot answer a question just skip it, as partial responses are also
   very valuable.

   Please return your completed survey by email attachment to the MPTCP
   WG Chairs: Philip Eardley <philip.eardley@bt.com> and Yoshifumi
   Nishida <nishida@sfc.wide.ad.jp>.

   If you wish to remain anonymous, please indicate -- we'll replace
   your answers in Question 1 by "Anonymous Implementation #n", but
   publish the rest of your answers unaltered, unless you ask for
   further obfuscation.  Please note that Philip Eardley works for BT
   and Yoshifumi Nishida works for GE; if you wish to remain anonymous
   from one of us, please return it to the other.

3.  Survey

3.1.  Question 1: Your details

   Question 1 gathers some information about the team that has
   implemented MPTCP.

   1.  Your institution:

   2.  Name(s) of people in your implementation and test teams:

   3.  Do you want your answers to Question 1.1 and 1.2 above to be
       anonymised?

3.2.  Question 2: Preliminary information about your implementation

   Question 2 gathers some preliminary information.

   1.  What OS is your implementation for?  (or is it application
       layer?)

   2.  Do you support IPv4 or IPv6 addresses or both?

   3.  Is it publicly available (or will it be?)  (for free or a fee?)

   4.  Overall, what are you implementation and testing plans?  (details
       can be given against individual items later)

   5.  Is it an independent implementation?  Or does it build on another
       MPTCP implementation -which one?

   6.  Have you already done some interop tests, for example with
       UCLouvain's "reference" Linux implementation?

   7.  Would you be prepared to take part in an interop event, for
       example adjacent to IETF-87 in Berlin?

3.3.  Question 3: Support for MPTCP's Signalling Functionality

   Question 3 asks about support for the various signalling messages
   that the MPTCP protocol defines.

   *** For each message, please give a little information about the
   status of your implementation: for example, you may have implemented
   it and fully tested it; the implementation may be in progress; you
   have not yet implemented it but plan to soon (timescale?); you may
   you have no intention to implement it (why?); etc.

   1.  Connection initiation (MP_CAPABLE) [Section 3.1 RFC6824]

       a.  What is the status of your implementation?

       b.  Any other comments or information?

   2.  Starting a new subflow (MP_JOIN) [Section 3.2 RFC6824]

       a.  What is the status of your implementation?

Internet-Draft      Survey of MPTCP Implementations             May 2013


       b.  Can either end of the connection start a new subflow (or only
           the initiator of the original subflow)?

       c.  What is the maximum number of subflows your implementation
           can support?

       d.  Any other comments or information?

   3.  Data transfer (DSS) [Section 3.3 RFC6824]

       a.  What is the status of your implementation?

       b.  The "Data ACK" field can be 4 or 8 octets.  Which one(s) have
           you implemented?

       c.  The "Data sequence number" field can be 4 or 8 octets.  Which
           one(s) have you implemented?

       d.  Does your implementation support the "DATA_FIN" operation to
           close an MPTCP connection?

       e.  Does your implementation support the "Checksum" field (which
           is negotiated in the MP_CAPABLE handshake)?

       f.  Any other comments or information?

   4.  Address management (ADD_ADDR and REMOVE_ADDR) [Section 3.4
       RFC6824]

       a.  What is the status of your implementation?

       b.  Can your implementation do ADD_ADDRESS for addresses that
           appear *after* the connection has been established?

       c.  Any other comments or information?

   5.  Fast close (MP_FASTCLOSE) [Section 3.5 RFC6824]

       a.  What is the status of your implementation?

       b.  Any other comments or information?

3.4.  Question 4: Fallback from MPTCP

   Question 4 asks about action when there is a problem with MPTCP, for
   example due to a middlebox mangling MPTCP's signalling.  The
   connection needs to fall back: if the problem is on the first subflow
   then MPTCP falls back to TCP, whilst if the problem is on an

   additional subflow then that subflow is closed with a TCP RST, as
   discussed in [Section 3.6 RFC6824].

   1.  If the MP_CAPABLE option is removed by a middlebox, does your
       implementation fall back to TCP?

   2.  If the MP_JOIN option does not get through on the SYNs, does your
       implementation close the additional subflow?

   3.  If the DSS option does not get through on the first data
       segment(s), does your implementation fall back?  (either falling
       back to MPTCP (if the issue is on the first subflow) or closing
       the additional subflow (if the issue is on an additional
       subflow))

   4.  Similarly, if the "DATA ACK" field does not correctly acknowledge
       the first data segment(s), does your implementation fall back?

   5.  Does your implementation protect data with the "Checksum" field
       in the DSS option [Section 3.3 RFC6824]?  If the checksum fails
       (because the subflow has been affected by a middlebox), does your
       implementation immediately close the affected subflow (with a TCP
       RST) with the MP_FAIL Option?  If the checksum fails and there is
       a single subflow, does your implementation handle this as a
       special case, as described in [Section 3.6 RFC6824]?

   6.  Does your implementation fall back to TCP by using an "infinite
       mapping" [Section 3.3.1 RFC6824] (so that the subflow-level data
       is mapped to the connection-level data for the remainder of the
       connection)?

   7.  Did you find any corner cases where MPTCP's fallback didn't
       happen properly?

   8.  Any other comments or information about fallback?

3.5.  Question 5: Heuristics

   Question 5 gathers information about heuristics: aspects that are not
   required for protocol correctness but impact the performance.  We
   would like to document best practice so that future implementers can
   learn from the experience of pioneers.  The references contain some
   initial comments about each topic.

   1.  Receiver considerations [S3.3.4, RFC6824]: What receiver buffer
       have you used?  Does this depend on the retransmission strategy?
       What advice should we give about the receiver?

Internet-Draft      Survey of MPTCP Implementations             May 2013


   2.  Sender considerations [S3.3.5, RFC6824]: How do you determine how
       much data a sender is allowed to send and how big the sender
       buffer is?  What advice should we give about the sender?

   3.  Reliability and retransmissions [S3.3.6, RFC6824]: What is your
       retransmission policy?  (when do you retransmit on the original
       subflow vs on another subflow or subflows?)  When do you decide
       that a subflow is underperforming and should be reset, and what
       do you then do?  What advice should we give about this issue?

   4.  Port usage [S3.3.8.1, RFC6824]: Does your implementation use the
       same port number for additional subflows as for the first
       subflow?  Have you used the ability to define a specific port in
       the Add Address option?  What advice should we give about this
       issue?

   5.  Delayed subflow start [S3.3.8.2, RFC6824]: What factors does your
       implementation consider when deciding about opening additional
       subflows?  What advice should we give about this issue?

   6.  Failure handling [S3.3.8.3, RFC6824]: Whilst the protocol defines
       how to handle some unexpected signals, the behaviour after other
       unexpected signals is not defined.  What advice should we give
       about this issue?

   7.  Use of TCP options: As discussed in [Appendix A, RFC6824], the
       TCP option space is limited, but a brief study found there was
       enough room to fit all the MPTCP options.  However there are
       constraints on which MPTCP option(s) can be included in packets
       with other TCP options - do the suggestions in Appendix A need
       amending or expanding?

   8.  What other heuristics should we give advice about?  Any other
       comments or information?

3.6.  Question 6: Security

   Question 6 asks about Security related matters [Section 5 RFC6824].

   1.  Does your implementation use the hash-based, HMAC-SHA1 security
       mechanism defined in [RFC6824]?

   2.  Does your implementation support any other handshake algorithms?

   3.  It has been suggested that a Standards-track MPTCP needs a more
       secure mechanism.  Do you have any views about how to achieve
       this?

   4.  Any other comments or information?

3.7.  Question 7: IANA

   Question 7 asks about IANA related matters.

   1.  Does your implementation follow the IANA-related definitions?
       [Section 8 RFC6824] defines: TCP Option Kind number (30); the
       sub-registry for "MPTCP Option Subtypes"; and the sub-registry
       for "MPTCP Handshake Algorithms"

   2.  Any other comments or information?

3.8.  Question 8: Congestion control and subflow policy

   Question 8 asks about how you share traffic across multiple subflows.

   1.  How does your implementation share traffic over the available
       paths?  For example: as a spare path on standby ('all-or-
       nothing'), as an 'overflow', etc?  Does it have the ability to
       send /receive traffic across multiple subflows simultaneously?

   2.  Does your implementation support "handover" from one subflow to
       another when losing an interface?

   3.  Does your implementation support the coupled congestion control
       defined in [RFC6356]?

   4.  Does your implementation support some other coupled congestion
       control (ie that balances traffic on multiple paths according to
       feedback)?

   5.  The MP_JOIN (Starting a new subflow) Option includes the "B" bit,
       which allows the sender to indicate whether it wishes the new
       subflow to be used immediately or as a backup if other path(s)
       fail.  The MP_PRIO Option is a request to change the "B" bit -
       either on the subflow on which it is sent, or (by setting the
       optional Address ID field) on other subflows.  Does your
       implementation support the "B" bit and MP_PRIO mechanisms?  Do
       you think they're useful, or have another suggestion?

   6.  Any other comments or information or suggestions about the advice
       we should give about congestion control [S3.3.7 RFC6824] and
       subflow policy [S3.3.8 RFC6824]?

3.9.  Question 9: API

Internet-Draft      Survey of MPTCP Implementations             May 2013


   Question 9 gathers information about your API.  [RFC6897] considers
   the MPTCP Application Interface.

   1.  With your implementation, can legacy applications use (the
       existing sockets API to use) MPTCP?  How does the implementation
       decide whether to use MPTCP?  Should the advice in [Section 4,
       RFC6897] be modified or expanded?

   2.  The "basic MPTCP API" enables MPTCP-aware applications to
       interact with the MPTCP stack via five new socket options.  For
       each one, have you implemented it?  has it been useful?

       a.  TCP_MULTIPATH_ENABLE?

       b.  TCP_MULTIPATH_ADD?

       c.  TCP_MULTIPATH_REMOVE?

       d.  TCP_MULTIPATH_SUBFLOWS?

       e.  TCP_MULTIPATH_CONNID?

   3.  Have you implemented any aspects of an "advanced MPTCP API"?
       ([Appendix A, RFC6897] hints at what it might include.)

   4.  Any other comments or information?

3.10.  Question 10: Deployments, use cases and operational experiences

   Question 10 takes the opportunity of this survey to gather some
   limited information about operational experiences and deployments.
   Any very brief information would be appreciated, for example:

   1.  What deployment scenarios are you most interested in?

   2.  Is your deployment on "the Internet" or in a controlled
       environment?

   3.  Is your deployment on end hosts or with a MPTCP-enabled proxy (at
       one or both ends?)?

   4.  What do you see as the most important benefits of MPTCP in your
       scenario(s)?

   5.  How extensively have you deployed and experimented with MPTCP so
       far?

   6.  MPTCP's design seeks to maximise the chances that the signalling
       works through middleboxes.  Did you find cases where middleboxes
       blocked MPTCP signalling?

   7.  MPTCP's design seeks to ensure that, if there is a problem with
       MPTCP signalling, then the connection either falls back to TCP or
       removes the problematic subflow.  Did you find any corner cases
       where this didn't happen properly?

   8.  Have you encountered any issues or drawbacks with MPTCP?

   9.  Any other comments or information?

3.11.  Question 11: Improvements to RFC6824

   1.  Are there any areas where [RFC6824] could be improved, either in
       technical content or clarity?

   2.  Any other issues you want to raise?

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   This survey does not impact the security of MPTCP, except to the
   extent that it uncovers security issues that can be tackled in a
   future version of the protocol.
