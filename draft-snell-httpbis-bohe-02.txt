1.  Binary Optimized Header Encoding

   Binary Optimized Header Encoding is a proposed alternative
   serialization for headers within SPDY SYN_STREAM, SYN_REPLY and
   HEADERS frames that is designed to optimize generation, consumption
   and processing of the most commonly used HTTP headers.

   Alternate Header Block Serialization:

    +-------+---------+
    |  NUM  | Headers |
    +-------+---------+

   'NUM' is a single unsigned 8-bit value indicating the total number of
   distinct headers contained in the encoded block.

   'Headers' consists of the complete set of encoded headers.  The
   format for each header is determined by whether the header name (the
   key) and the header value are included in the static "default
   dictionary" defined by this specification.  The first two bits of
   each encoded header record identify the specific header format used.

   Registered Key + Registered Value Pair

     +--+---+--+
     |00|FLG|ID|
     +--+---+--+

   If the header name and value are both included in the default
   dictionary, the header is encoded using only three distinct fields:
   the two-bit opcode (00) followed by six unused flag bits, followed by
   the index of the header key+value pair as provided by the default
   dictionary, encoded as a variable-length, unsigned integer.

   Registered Key + Unregistered Value

     +--+---+--+---+---+
     |01|FLG|ID|LEN|VAL|
     +--+---+--+---+---+

   If the header name is included in the default dictionary, but the
   value given is not, the header is encoded using five fields: the two-
   bit opcode (01) followed by six flag bits as defined below, followed
   by the numerically lowest index of the named header as provided by
   the default dictionary encoded as a variable-length, unsigned
   integer, followed by another variable-length, unsigned integer
   specifying the length of the value, followed by the encoded value.

   Unregistered Key + Value Pair

     +--+---+------+---+------+---+
     |10|FLG|LENkey|key|LENval|val|
     +--+---+------+---+------+---+

   If the header name and value are not included in the default
   dictionary, the header is encoded using six distinct fields: the two-
   bit opcode (10) followed by six flag bits as defined below, followed
   by a variable-length, unsigned integer specifying the key length,
   followed by the ISO-8859-1 encoded key name, followed by a variable-
   length, unsigned integer specifying the value length, followed by the
   encoded value.

   Flags:

     FLG = 000000
           ||||||
           ||||Reserved
           |||Numeric (val is one or more uvarints)
           ||Huffman-encoded
           |UTF-8 or ISO8859-1 (1 or 0)
           Binary | Text (1 or 0)

   When the opcode is either 01 or 10, the six-bit FLG field is used to
   specify additional properties about the header value.  When the
   opcode is 00, the FLG bits are unused and MUST NOT be set.

   Moving from the most significant bit to the least, the flags are:
   o  Binary or Text (0x32) - When set, the value is to be interpreted
      as binary data.  When unset, the value is to be interpreted as
      encoded-text.
   o  UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1 (0x16) - When set, indicates that the text-
      encoded value is UTF-8 encoded.  Otherwise, ISO-8859-1 is assumed.
      Only used if the Binary or Text bit is unset.
   o  Huffman-encoded (0x08) - When set, indicates that the text-encoded
      value has been static huffman encoded.  The static dictionary used
      for the encoding is dependent on whether the text is UTF-8 or ISO-
      8859-1 encoded.  Only used if the Binary or Text bit is unset.
   o  Numeric (0x04) - When set, indicates that the value is encoded as
      a variable-length unsigned integer.  Only used if the Binary or
      Text bit is set (indicating a binary value).
   o  The final two bits (0x02 and 0x01) are reserved.
