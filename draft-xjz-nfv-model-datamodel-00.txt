1. Introduction

   YANG [RFC6020] is a data modeling language used to model
   configuration and state data manipulated by the Network Configuration
   Protocol (NETCONF) [RFC6241]. A small set of built-in data types are
   defined in [RFC6020], a collection of common data types are further
   defined in [RFC6991].

   This document defines a YANG [RFC6020] data model for Network
   Functions Virtualization (NFV).

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3. Terminology

   CMS: Cloud Management System.

   Network Function (NF): A functional building block within an
   operator's network infrastructure, which has well-defined external
   interfaces and a well-defined functional behaviour.

   NF set: A collection of NFs with unspecified connectivity between
   them.

   Network Functions Virtualization Orchestrator (NFVO): a function that
   deploys, operates, manages, and coordinates VNFs and the respective
   NFVI.  The Orchestrator has control and visibility of all VNF running
   inside the NFVI.

   Network Functions Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI): the totality
   of all hardware and software components that constitute the
   environment in which VNFs are deployed, managed and executed. The
   NFVI includes resources for computation, networking and storage.

   Physical Network Function (PNF): An implementation of a NF via a
   tightly coupled software and hardware system.

   Virtual Machine (VM): A program and configuration of part of a host
   computer server.  Note that the Virtual Machine inherits the
   properties of its host computer server e.g. location, network
   interfaces.

   Virtualised Network Function (VNF): An implementation of an
   executable software program that constitutes the whole or a part of
   an NF and can be deployed on a virtualisation infrastructure.

   VNF Descriptor (VNFD): A configuration template that describes a VNF
   in terms of its deployment and operational behavior, and is used in
   the process of on-boarding and instantiating a VNF. The deployment
   behavior describes the NFV Infrastructure resources that a VNF
   instance requires whereas the operational behavior describes the VNF
   instance topology and VNF instance lifecycle operations.

   VNF Forwarding Graph: A graph specified by a Network Service Provider
   of bi-directional logical links connecting NF nodes where at least
   one node is a VNF through which network traffic is directed.

   NFV Service: A network service utilizing NFs, where at least some NFs
   are VNFs. A VNF Forwarding Graph is an example of such a service.

4. Virtual Network Function Descriptor (VNFD)



4.1. VNFD Components

   The main objective of VNF modeling will include:

   - Basic VNF attributes: VNF name, function description, sharing or
   non-sharing attribute.

   - Deployment attributes: environment requirements of VNF deployment
   such as the number of VMs, virtual CPU, memory and disk requirements,
   image of each VM, and QoS requirements such as bandwidth and delay of
   VNF.

   - Operational attributes: which defines the operational and
   management behavior, such as start, stop, pause, migration and etc.

   - Interface attributes: external interface, such as interface type,
   configuration parameters of these interfaces.



4.2. NFVD Data Model

   NFNode is defined as a basic class of VNF data type.
