Internet-Draft       NHDP and OLSRv2 Extension TLVs            July 2013


1.  Introduction

   The MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) [RFC6130] and the
   Optimized Link State Routing Protocol, version 2 (OLSRv2) [OLSRv2]
   are protocols for use in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) [RFC2501],
   based on the Generalized Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Packet/Message
   Format [RFC5444].

   This document updates [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2], specifically their use
   of TLV (Type-Length-Value) elements, to increase the extensibility of
   these protocols, and to enable some improvements in their
   implementation.

   This specification reduces the latitude of implementations of
   [OLSRv2] and [RFC6130] to consider some messages, which will not be
   created by implementations simply following those specifications, as
   a reason to consider the message as "badly formed", and thus as a
   reason to reject the message.  This gives greater latitude to the
   creation of extensions of these protocols, in particular extensions
   that will interoperate with unextended implementations of those
   protocols.  As part of that, it indicates how TLVs (Type-Length-Value
   elements) [RFC5444] with unexpected value fields must be handled, and
   adds some additional options to those TLVs.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   Additionally, this document uses the terminology of [RFC5444],
   [RFC6130], and [OLSRv2].


3.  Applicability Statement

   This document updates the specification of the protocols [OLSRv2] and
   [RFC6130].  As such it is applicable to all implementations of these
   protocols.

   Specifically, this specification updates [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] in
   the following way:

   o  Removes the latitude of rejecting a message with a TLV with a
      known type, but with an unexpected TLV Value field, for the TLV
      Types defined in [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2].

Internet-Draft       NHDP and OLSRv2 Extension TLVs            July 2013


   o  Specifies the handling of a TLV Value field with unexpected
      length.

   o  Sets up IANA registries for TLV Values for the Address Block TLVs:

      *  LOCAL_IF, defined in [RFC6130].

      *  LINK_STATUS, defined in [RFC6130].

      *  OTHER_NEIGHB, defined in [RFC6130].

      *  MPR, defined in [OLSRv2], now considered as a bit field.

      *  NBR_ADDR_TYPE, defined in [OLSRv2], now considered as a bit
         field.

   o  Defines a well-known TLV Value for "UNSPECIFIED" for the Address
      Block TLV Types LOCAL_IF, LINK_STATUS, and OTHER_NEIGHB, all
      defined in [RFC6130].


4.  TLV Values

   NHDP [RFC6130] and OLSRv2 [OLSRv2] define a number of TLVs within the
   framework of [RFC5444].  These TLVs define the meaning of only some
   of the contents that can be found in a TLV Value field.  This
   limitation may be either only defining certain TLV Values, or
   considering only some lengths of the TLV Value fields (or single
   value field in a multi value Address-Block TLV).  This specification
   describes how NHDP [RFC6130] and OLSRv2 [OLSRv2] SHOULD handle TLVs
   with other TLV Value fields.

4.1.  Unrecognized TLV Values

   NHDP and OLSRv2 specify that, in addition to well-defined reasons (in
   the respective protocol specifications), an implementation of these
   protocols MAY recognize a message as "badly formed" and therefore
   "invalid for processing" for other reasons (Section 12.1 of [RFC6130]
   and Section 16.3.1 of [OLSRv2]).  These sections could be interpreted
   as allowing rejection of a message because a TLV Value field is
   unrecognized.  This specification removes that latitude:

   o  An implementation MUST NOT reject a message because it contains
      such a TLV.  Instead, any unrecognied TLV Value field MUST be
      processed or ignored by an unextended implementation of NHDP or
      OLSRv2, as discussed in the following sections.

   It should be stressed that this is not a change to [RFC6130] or



Dearlove & Clausen      Expires February 1, 2014                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       NHDP and OLSRv2 Extension TLVs            July 2013


   [OLSRv2], except with regard to not allowing this to be a reason for
   rejection of a message.  [RFC6130] or [OLSRv2] are specified in terms
   such as "if an address is associated with a value of LOST by a
   LINK_STATUS TLV".  Association with an unrecognized value has no
   effect on any implementation strictly following such a specification.

4.2.  TLV Value Lengths

   The TLVs specified in [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] may be either single-
   value or multi-value TLVs.  In either case, the length of the
   information encoded in the TLV Value field is the "single-length",
   defined and calculated as per section 5.4.1 in [RFC5444].  All TLVs
   specified in [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] describe TLVs with one or two
   octet TLV Value field single-lengths.  These are considered the
   expected values of single-length for a received TLV.

   Other single-length TLV Value fields may be introduced by extensions
   to [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2].  This document specifies how
   implementations of [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2], or extensions thereof,
   MUST behave on receiving TLVs of the TLV types defined in [RFC6130]
   and [OLSRv2], but with TLV Value fields with other single-length.

   The following principles apply:

   o  If the received single-length is greater than the expected single-
      length, then the excess octets MUST be ignored.

   o  If the received single-length is less than the expected single-
      length, then the absent octets MUST considered to have all bits
      cleared (0).

   Exceptions:

   o  A received CONT_SEQ_NUM with a signle-lentgh < 2 SHOULD be
      considered an error.

4.3.  Undefined TLV Values

   [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2] define a number of TLVs, but for some of these
   TLVs specify meanings for only some TLV Values.  This document
   establishes IANA registries for these TLV Values, with initial
   registrations reflecting those used by [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2], and as
   specified in Section 4.3.3.

   There are different cases of TLV Values with different
   characteristics.  These cases are considerd in this section.

Internet-Draft       NHDP and OLSRv2 Extension TLVs            July 2013


4.3.1.  NHDP TLVs: LOCAL_IF, LINK_STATUS and OTHER_NEIGHB

   For the Address-Block TLVs LOCAL_IF, LINK_STAUS and OTHER_NEIGHB
   TLVs, defined in [RFC6130], only a limited number of values are
   specified for each.  These are converted, by this specification, into
   extensible registries with initial registrations for values defined
   and used by [RFC6130] - see Section 5.

   An implementation of [RFC6130], receiving a TLV with any TLV Value
   other than those values used in that specification, MUST ignore that
   TLV Value and any corresponding attribute association to the address.

4.3.2.  OLSRv2 TLVs: MPR and NBR_ADDR_TYPE

   The Address-Block TLVs MPR and NBR_ADDR_TYPE, defined in [OLSRv2],
   are similar to those defined in [RFC6130] in having only limited
   values specified (1, 2 and 3): 1 and 2, represent presence of two
   different attributes associated to an address, and 3 represents "both
   1 and 2".

   These TLV Value fields, are by this specification, converted to bit
   fields, and MUST be interpreted as such.  As the existing definitions
   of values 1, 2, and 3 behave in that manner, it is likely that this
   will involve no change to an implementation, but any test of (for
   example) Value = 1 or Value = 3 MUST be converted to a test of (for
   example) Value bitand 1 = 1, where "bitand" denotes a bitwise and
   operation.

   This specification creates registries for recording reservations of
   the individual bits in these bitfields, with initial registrations
   for values defined and used by [OLSRv2] - see Section 5.

   Other TLVs, defined by [OLSRv2], are not affected by this
   specification.

4.3.3.  Unspecified TLV Values

   The registries defined in Section 5 for the LOCAL_IF, LINK_STATUS and
   OTHER_NEIGHB TLVs each include an additional TLV Value UNSPECIFIED.
   This TLV Value represents a value that MUST NOT be defined in any
   extension of [RFC6130].  Such a TLV Value MAY be used to enable the
   creation of more efficient multivalue Address Block TLVs, or to
   simplify an implementation.

   The similar requirement for the MPR and NBR_ADDR_TYPES TLVs is
   already satisfied by the TLV Value zero, provided that each bit in
   the TLV Value is defined as set ('1') when indicating the presence of
   an attribute, or clear ('0') when indicating the absence of an

   attribute; this is therefore REQUIRED for registrations from the
   relevant registries, see Section 5.

   For the LINK_METRIC TLV, this is already possible by clearing the
   most significant bits (0 to 3) of the first octet of the TLV Value.
   It is RECOMMENDED that in this case the remaining bits of the TLV
   Value are either all clear ('0') or all set ('1').


5.  IANA Considerations

   Note: Values defined as "Unallocated: Expert Review" mean that these
   values may be allocated according to the expert review guidelines
   specified in [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2].  In two cases a constraint on
   future allocation is specified.

5.1.  Address Block TLVs

   IANA is requested to create a registry associated with the Address
   Block TLV with name LOCAL_IF (Type = 2, Type Extension = 0) defined
   in [RFC6130], specifying the meaning of its single values.  This
   replaces the Description column in Table 6 in [RFC6130] by a
   reference to this table.

                       Table 1: LOCAL_IF TLV Values

   IANA are requested to create a registry associated with the Address
   Block TLV with name LINK_STATUS (Type = 3, Type Extension = 0)
   defined in [RFC6130], specifying the meaning of its single values.
   This replaces the Description column in Table 7 in [RFC6130] by a
   reference to this table.

   7 (least significant).  If multiple bits are set then each applies.

                        Table 4: MPR TLV Bit Values

   Note that this registry maintains a bit field, and that the
   combination of the bits FLOODING + ROUTING being set (1) (which gives
   a value of 3) is given the name FLOOD_ROUTE in [OLSRv2].  For all
   future allocations, the Expert Review MUST ensure that allocated bits
   MUST use the unset bit (0) to indicates no information, so that the
   case Value = 0 will always indicate that no information about this
   network address is provided.

   IANA are requested to create a registry associated with the Address
   Block TLV with name NBR_ADDR_TYPE (Type = 9, Type Extension = 0)
   defined in [OLSRv2], specifying the meaning of its single values in
   terms of the values of each bit of the value, from bit 0 (most
   significant) to bit 7 (least significant).  If multiple bits are set

   Note that this registry maintains a bit field, and that the
   combination of the bits ORIGINATOR + ROUTABLE being set (1) (which
   gives a value of 3) is given the name ROUTABLE_ORIG in [OLSRv2].  For
   all future allocations, the Expert Review MUST ensure that allocated

   bits MUST use the unset bit (0) to indicates no information, so that
   the case Value = 0 will always indicate that no information about
   this network address is provided.


6.  Security Considerations

   The presented updates to [RFC6130] and [OLSRv2]:

   o  Create IANA registries for retaining TLV values for TLVs, already
      defined in the already published specifications of the two
      protocols, and with initial registrations for the TLV values
      defined by these specifications.  This does not give rise to any
      additional security considerations.

   o  Enable protocol extensions to be able to register TLV values in
      the created IANA registries.  Such extensions MUST specify
      appropriate security considerations.

   o  Create, in some registries, a registration for "UNSPECIFIED"
      values, for more efficient use of multi-value Address Block TLVs.
      The interpretation of an address being associated with a TLV of a
      given type and with the value "UNSPECIFIED" is identical to that
      address not being associated with a TLV of that type.  Thus, this
      update does not give rise to any additional security
      considerations.

   o  Reduces the latitude of implementations of the two protocols to
      reject a message as "badly formed", due to the value field of a
      TLV being unexpected.  These protocols are specified in terms such
      as "if an address is associated with a value of LOST by a
      LINK_STATUS TLV".  Association with an unknown value (or a value
      newly defined to mean no link status information) has no effect on
      such a specification.  Thus, this update does not give rise to any
      additional security considerations.

   o  Do not introduce any opportunities for attacks on the protocols
      through signal modification, not already present in the two
      protocols.
