Internet-Draft              RTP Leap Seconds               February 2013


1.  Introduction

   In some media networking applications, RTP streams are referenced to
   a wall-clock time (absolute date and time).  This is accomplished
   through use of the NTP timestamp field in the RTCP sender report (SR)
   to create a mapping between RTP timestamps and the wall clock.  When
   a wall-clock reference is used, the playout time for RTP packets is
   referenced to the wall clock.  Smooth and continuous media playout
   requires a smooth and continuous time base.  The time base used by
   the wall clock may include leap seconds which are not rendered
   smoothly.

   This document updates RFC 3550 [1] providing recommendations for
   smoothly rendering streamed media referenced to common wall clocks
   which do not have smooth or continuous behavior in the presence of
   leap seconds.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.


3.  Leap seconds

   The world scientific time standard is International Atomic Time (TAI)
   which is based on vibrations of cesium atoms in an atomic clock.  The
   world civil time is based on the rotation of the Earth.  In 1972 the
   civil time standard, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), was redefined
   in terms of TAI and the concept of leap seconds was introduced to
   allow UTC to remain synchronized with with the rotation of the Earth.

   Leap seconds are scheduled by the International Earth Rotation and
   Reference Systems Service.  Leap seconds may be scheduled at the last
   day of any month but are preferentially scheduled for December and
   June and secondarily March and September.[3] Because Earth's rotation
   is unpredictable, leap seconds are typically not scheduled more than
   six months in advance.

   Leap seconds do not respect local time and always occur at the end of
   the UTC day.  Leap seconds can be scheduled to either add or remove a
   second from the day.  A leap second that adds an extra second is
   known as a positive leap second.  A leap second that skips a second
   is known as a negative leap second.  All leap seconds since their
   introduction in 1972 have been scheduled in June or December and all

   have been positive.

   NOTE- The ITU is studying a proposal which could eventually eliminate
   leap seconds from UTC.  As of January 2012, this proposal is expected
   to be decided no earlier than 2015.[4]

3.1.  UTC behavior during leap second

   UTC clocks insert a 61st second at the end of the day when a leap
   second is scheduled.  The leap second is designated "23h 59m 60s".

3.2.  NTP behavior during leap second

   Under NTP [5] a leap second is inserted at the beginning of the last
   second of the day.  This results in the clock freezing or slowing for
   one second immediately prior to the last second of the affected day.
   This results in the last second of the day having a real-time
   duration of two seconds.  Timestamp accuracy is compromised during
   this period because the clock's rate is not well defined.

3.3.  POSIX behavior during leap second

   Most POSIX systems insert the leap second at the end of the last
   second of the day.  This results in repetition of the last second.  A
   timestamp within the last second of the day is therefore ambiguous in
   that it can refer to a moment in time in either of the last two
   seconds of a day containing a leap second.

3.4.  Summary of leap-second behaviors

   Table 1 summarizes behavior across a leap second for the wall clocks
   discussed above.

   Table 1 illustrates the leap second that occurred June 30, 2012 when
   the offset between International Atomic time (TAI) and UTC changed
   from 34 to 35 seconds.  The first column shows RTP timestamps for an
   8 kHz audio stream.  The second column shows the TAI reference.
   Following columns show behavior for the leap-second-bearing wall
   clocks described above.  Time values are shown at half-second
   intervals.

                                  Table 1

   NOTE- Some NTP implementations do not entirely freeze the clock while
   the leap second is inserted.  Successive calls to retrieve system
   time return infinitesimally larger (e.g. 1 microsecond or 1
   nanosecond) time values.  This behavior is designed to satisfy
   assumptions applications may make that time increases monotonically.
   This behavior occurs in the least-significant bits of the time value
   and so is not typically visible in the human-readable format shown in
   the table.


4.  Recommendations

   Senders and receivers which are not referenced to a wall clock are
   not affected by issues associated with leap seconds and no special
   accommodation is required.

   RTP implementation using a wall-clock reference is simplified by
   using a clock with a timescale which does not include leap seconds.
   IEEE 1588,[6] GPS [7] and other TAI [8] references do not include
   leap seconds.  NTP time, operating system clocks and other UTC
   references include leap seconds.

   All participants working to a leap-second-bearing reference SHOULD
   recognize leap seconds and have a working communications channel to
   receive notification of leap second scheduling.  Without prior
   knowledge of leap second schedule, NTP servers and clients may become
   offset by exactly one second with respect to their UTC reference.
   This potential discrepancy begins when a leap second occurs and ends
   when all participants receive a time update from a server or peer.
   Depending on the system implementation, the offset can last anywhere
   from a few seconds to a few days.  A long-lived discrepancy can be
   particularly disruptive to RTP operation.

   Because of the timestamp ambiguity, positive leap seconds can

   introduce and the inconsistent manner in which different systems
   accommodate leap seconds, generating or using NTP timestamps during
   the entire last second of a day on which a positive leap second has
   been scheduled SHOULD be avoided.  Note that the period to be avoided
   has a real-time duration of two seconds.  In the Table 1 example, the
   region to be avoided is indicated by RTP timestamps 12000 through
   28000

   Negative leap seconds do not introduce timestamp ambiguity or other
   complications.  No special treatment with respect to RTP timestamps
   is required in the presence of a negative leap second.

4.1.  RTP Sender Reports

   RTP Senders working to a leap-second-bearing reference SHOULD NOT
   generate sender reports containing an originating NTP timestamp in
   the vicinity of a positive leap second.  To maintain a consistent
   RTCP schedule and avoid the risk of unintentional timeouts, such
   senders MAY send receiver reports in place of sender reports in the
   vicinity of the leap second.

   For the purpose of suspending sender reports in the vicinity of a
   leap second, senders MAY assume a positive leap second occurs at the
   end of the last day of every month.

   Receivers working to a leap-second-bearing reference SHOULD ignore
   timestamps in any sender reports generated in the vicinity of a
   positive leap second.

   For the purpose of ignoring sender reports in the vicinity of a leap
   second, receivers MAY assume a positive leap second occurs at the end
   of the last day of every month.

4.2.  RTP Packet Playout

   Receivers working to a leap-second-bearing reference SHOULD take both
   positive and negative leap seconds in the reference into account in
   determining playout time based on RTP timestamps for data in RTP
   packets.


5.  Security Considerations

   RTP streams using a wall-clock reference as discussed here present an
   additional attack vector compared to self-clocking streams.
   Manipulation of the wall clock at either sender or receiver can
   potentially disrupt streaming.

   For an RTP stream operating to an leap-seocnd-bearing reference to
   operate reliably across a leap second, sender and receive must both
   be aware of the leap second.  It is possible to disrupt a stream by
   blocking or delaying leap second notification to one of the
   participants.  Streaming can be similarly affected if one of the
   participants can be tricked into believing a leap second has been
   scheduled where there is not one.  These vulnerabilities are present
   in RFC 3550 [1] and these new recommendations neither heighten or
   diminish them.  Integrity of the leap second schedule is the
   responsibility of the operating system and time distribution
   mechanism both of which are outside the scope of RFC 3550 [1] and
   these recommendations.
