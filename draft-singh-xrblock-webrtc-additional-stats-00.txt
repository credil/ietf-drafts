1.  Introduction

   Web-based real-time communication (WebRTC) deployments are emerging
   and applications need to be able to estimate the service quality.  If
   sufficient information (metrics or statistics) are provided to the
   applications, it can attempt to improve the media quality.
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-use-cases-and-requirements] specifies a requirement
   for statistics:

   F38   The browser must be able to collect statistics, related to the
         transport of audio and video between peers, needed to estimate
         quality of experience.


   RTCWEB-STATS [I-D.alvestrand-rtcweb-stats-registry] describes a
   registration procedure for metrics reported by the Javascript API.
   It currently lists basic metrics reported in the RTCP Sender and
   Receiver Report (SR/RR) to fulfill this requirement.  However, the
   basic metrics from RTCP SR/RR are not sufficient for precise quality
   monitoring or troubleshooting.  They are better complemented with

   metrics defined in RTCP Extended Reports (XR), an in depth discussion
   about the XR metrics candidates is carried out in
   [I-D.huang-xrblock-rtcweb-rtcp-xr-metrics].

2.  Candidate XR Block Metrics

   This group of identifiers are well defined on a ReportGroup
   corresponding to an SSRC and are intended to complement the
   identifiers in Section 4.1 of [I-D.alvestrand-rtcweb-stats-registry].

   The following contact information is used for all registrations in

Appendix A.  Metrics represented using RFC6390 Template

   RFC EDITOR NOTE: please change XXXX in [RFCXXXX] by the new RFC
   number, when assigned and remove this note.

   a.  Number of Packets Retransmitted Metric

       *  Metric Name: Cumulative number of RTP Packets retransmitted

       *  Metric Description: Total number of packets retransmitted from
          the beginning of the session.

       *  Method of Measurement or Calculation: Cumulative number of
          retransmitted packets received from the beginning of the
          session.  The measured value is an unsigned value.  If the
          measured value exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFFFE MUST
          be reported to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the
          measurement is unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFFFF MUST be
          reported.

       *  Units of Measurement: The counter is increased by one for
          every retransmitted RTP packet that is received.

       *  Measurement Point(s) with Potential Measurement Domain: This
          metric reports the number of retransmitted RTP packets
          received by the receiver.  The measurement of these metrics
          are made at the receiving end of the retransmission stream and
          the association of the retransmission and original streams
          should refer to section 5.3 of [RFC4588].

       *  Measurement Timing: This metric is applicable to cumulative
          measurements, which may be the duration of the ongoing RTP
          session.

       *  Use and applications: See section 1 of [RFCXXXX].

       *  Reporting model: Queried periodically by the WebRTC Statistics
          API.
