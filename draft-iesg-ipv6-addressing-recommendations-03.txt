This document provides recommendations to the addressing registries
(APNIC, ARIN and RIPE-NCC) on policies for assigning IPv6 address
blocks to end sites.  In particular, it recommends the assignment of
/48 in the general case, /64 when it is known that one and only one
subnet is needed and /128 when it is absolutely known that one and
only one device is connecting.
 
The original recommendations were made in an IAB/IESG statement
mailed to the registries on September 1, 2000.  This document refines
the original recommendation and documents it for the historical
record.

This document is a product of the Internet Engineering Steering Group.
