    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	When a site is numbered using <xref target="RFC3633">DHCP
	prefix delegation</xref>, there are three ways of populating
	the <xref target="RFC1035">Domain Name System</xref> reverse
	tree.  Which mechanism is chosen depends on the capabilities
	of the site's DNS infrastructure, if any, on the capabilities
	and policies of the service provider, and on the preferences
	of the site administration.
      </t>
      <t>
	This document does not take a position on which mechanism, if any,
	is best for populating the reverse tree, but simply documents each
	of the possible mechanisms for doing so, and provides a means
	whereby site administrators and service providers can negotiate the
	mechanism whereby the reverse tree for a particular site will be
	populated.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      
      <t>
	The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
	NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
	"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
	in <xref target='RFC2119'/>.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Methods for populating the reverse tree">
      <t>
	There are three common methods of populating the reverse tree for a
	delegated prefix: delegation, dynamic dns, and zone spoofing.  In
	addition, of course, it is possible to leave the reverse tree
	unpopulated.
      </t>
      <section title="Site-managed reverse tree">
	<t>
	  To populate the reverse tree by delegation, the site administrator
	  must provide a DNS authoritative name server for the delegated zone.
	  The site administrator must communicate the IP address of the
	  authoritative name server to the service provider.  The service
	  provider must then add a delegation for that zone using the IP
	  address or addresses of the DNS authoritative servers provided by
	  the site administrator.
	</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Provider-managed reverse tree">
	<t>
	  To populate the reverse tree using DNS updates, the service provider
	  must provide an authoritative name server for the zone.  The site
	  administrator must provide a key to the service provider that can be
	  used to authenticate DNS updates.  The site administrator must then
	  provide a mechanism whereby DNS updates will automatically be
	  generated, using the provided key, whenever IP addresses are
	  allocated within the delegated prefix.
	</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Provider-managed spoofed reverse tree">
	<t>
	  In some cases the site administrator may not be willing or able to
	  populate a reverse tree.  However, the service provider may wish to
	  provide meaningful answers to reverse zone queries for the delegated
	  zone.  It's not possible to populate the delegated zone: a fully
	  populated zone for a /64 would require 1.8x10^19 names.  However,
	  the names in such a zone would never change; consequently it is
	  possible for a name server to spoof the zone contents, constructing
	  answers for queries against any name within the zone on the fly.
	  Because the contents of the zone never change, the zone can have a
	  consistent authority record.
	</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Other solutions not documented here">
	<t>
	  It's worth noting that there are several other ways that the zone
	  for a delegated prefix could be populated, but we are not covering
	  these mechanisms because they seem more difficult to implement and
	  deploy.  For instance, nodes configured with addresses within a
	  delegated prefix could issue their own DNS updates to an
	  authoritative server operated by the service provider.  The problem
	  of key management in this case becomes intractable, however.
	</t>
	<t>
	  It would also be possible for the site to have its own key
	  management infrastructure, and for some agent on the requesting
	  router to act as an intermediary in updating a zone maintained by
	  the service provider.  However, this is substantially more
	  complicated than either of the proposed solutions.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Another option is to simply not populate the reverse tree.  This is
	  an attractive option in the IETF in particular because the reverse
	  tree is frequently used for purposes to which it is not suited, and
	  some IETF participants believe that in order to discourage these
	  applications, it's better simply to not populate the reverse tree.
	  This document takes no position on this question, but does offer a
	  means whereby the site administrator can indicate that the reverse
	  tree should not be populated.
	</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section title="Negotiating the reverse tree population method">
      <t>
	The prefix delegation process is initiated by a requesting router.
	If a delegating router chooses to delegate a prefix to the
	requesting router, it replies with a prefix.  The requesting router
	may receive responses from more than one delegating router, and may
	choose one or more such delegated prefixes.  For delegating routers
	whose offer is accepted, the requesting router sends a request for
	the offered address; at this point the delegating router commits the
	delegation to stable storage and sends a confirmation to the
	requesting router.
      </t>
      <t>
	The messages used to complete this transaction are the DHCP
	Discover, DHCP Advertise, DHCP Request and DHCP Reply messages,
	respectively.  The negotiation as to how the reverse tree will be
	populated piggybacks on this four-message process.
      </t>
      <t>
	In the DHCP Discover message, the requesting router indicates the
	site administrator's preference for how the reverse tree for the
	delegated prefix will be populated.  It does this by including, in
	each IA_PD option it sends, a Prefix Delegation Zone Preference
	option (PDZP) containing one or more preference codes.  These codes
	are listed in order of preference with the most preferred mechanism
	first.  A requesting router that includes a PDZP option MUST send an
	Option Request option (ORO) that requests the Prefix Delegation Zone
	Method (PDZM) option.
      </t>
      <t>
	If the delegating router chooses not to delegate a prefix to the
	requesting router, no special action need be taken in response to
	the PDZP option.  The remainder of this section describes what
	happens if the delegating router chooses to delegate a prefix to the
	requesting router.
      </t>
      <t>
	Delegating routers that implement this specification can be
	configured with a list of supported reverse tree population methods.
	When a requesting router receives an IA_PD option that includes a
	PDZP option, if it has been configured with a reverse tree
	population method list, it iterates across the list of methods in
	the PDZP option.  For each entry in the PDZP option, the requesting
	router tests to see if that method has been configured by the site
	administrator as being supported.  If the method is on the list, the
	iteration stops at this point.
      </t>
      <t>
	Upon completion of this iteration, if a method was found in the PDZA
	that is supported by the delegating router, that is the method that
	will be used to populate the reverse tree for the delegated zone.
	The delegating router constructs a PDZM option indicating that this
	method will be used and includes this in the DHCP Advertise message.
      </t>
      <t>
	If no supported method was found, this means that the service
	provider will not cooperate with the site administrator in
	populating the reverse tree.  The delegating router indicates that
	this is the case by not including a PDZM option in the DHCP
	Advertise message..
      </t>
      <t>
	The requesting router may receive one or more DHCP Advertise
	messages containing delegated prefixes.  The requesting router MUST
	silently discard any DHCP Advertise message containing a PDZM option
	that indicates a method that was not listed in the PDZP option sent
	in the DHCP Discover message.
      </t>
      <t>
	The requesting router may then choose to respond to one or more of
	the remaining DHCP Advertise messages, if any.  The lack of a PDZM
	option indicates either that the delegating router does not
	implement DNS for delegated prefixes, or that it is not configured
	to support DNS for delegated prefixs.  The requesting router MAY
	prefer DHCP Advertise messages containing PDZM options over DHCP
	Advertise messages that do not contain PDZM options.
      </t>
      <t>
	When responding to any DHCP Advertise messages containing PDZM
	options, the requesting router MUST include a PDZM option containing
	the same method indicated in the received PDZM option.
      </t>
      <t>
	Each delegating router that receives a DHCP Request message
	containing a PDZM option MUST check the method indicated in the PDZM
	option is supported; if not, the delegating router MUST silently
	discard the DHCP Request option. <!-- XXX check against 3633, should
	do the same as if the IA_PD is bogus -->
      </t>
      <t>
	The requesting and delegating routers should follow the same
	procedure specified for the DHCP Request/DHCP Reply sequence
	whenever a DHCP Renew or DHCP Rebind is sent and a DHCP reply sent
	in response, if that response renews the delegated prefix.  In the
	case that the response does not renew the prefix, the delegating
	router MUST NOT send a PDZM in the IA_PD option.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Configuring a site-managed reverse tree">
      <t>
	If the PDZM option returned by the delegating router in the DHCP
	Advertise message specifies the Site Managed method, the requesting
	router must arrange to set up one or more authoritative name servers
	that will provide service for the zone or zones that correspond to
	the delegated prefix.  It must also communicate to the delegating
	router the IP address or addresses of these servers.
      </t>
      <section title="Requesting Router Behavior">
	<t>
	  The requesting router MUST include a Prefix Delegation Zone
	  Server (PDZS) option in each IA_PD in the DHCP Request message,
	  which includes zero or more IP addresses of authoritative name
	  servers for the delegated zone.  IPv4 addresses MUST be
	  represented as IPv4-Embedded IPv6 addresses using the <xref
	  target="RFC6052">Well-Known prefix</xref>.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Authoritative name service for these zones may be provided by any or
	  all of the following three types of authoritative name servers:
	</t>
	<t>
	  <list style="symbols">
	    <t>
	      An authoritative name server running on a node that has an IP
	      address known to the requesting router that is not obtained
	      from the prefix being delegated.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      An authoritative name server running on the requesting router.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      An authoritative name server running on a node that will
	      obtain its only IP address from the prefix being delegated.
	    </t>
	  </list>
	</t>
	<t>
	  In the first case, it is possible that the reverse zone for
	  the delegated prefix is already configured on the
	  authoritative name server.  In this case, the requesting
	  router SHOULD include the IP address of the authoritative
	  name servers for the delegated zone in the PDZS option.
	</t>
	<t>
	  However, if the prefix is being delegated for the first time,
	  the delegating router will not have had an opportunity to
	  configure it prior to sending the DHCP Request message.  In this
	  case, the delegating router SHOULD NOT include the IP Address of
	  this name server in the PDZS option that's send in the DHCP
	  Request message; instead, it should send a DHCP Renew once the
	  authoritative server has been configured, and list the server's
	  IP address in the PDZS option in the DHCP Renew message.
	</t>
	<t>
	  In the second case, the requesting router may already have an IP
	  address, and may be able to configure the authoritative server
	  for the delegated zone before sending the DHCP Request.  In this
	  case, the requesing router SHOULD include its own IP address in
	  the PDZS option in the DHCP Request message.
	</t>
	<t>
	  If the requesting router does not have an IP address at this
	  time, it SHOULD send a DHCP Renew message containing a PDZS
	  option that lists all the authoritative servers for the reverse
	  zone or zones for the delegated prefix after it has an IP
	  address and has configured the authoritative servers.
	</t>
	<t>
	  If the authoritative name server is running on a node that will
	  configure its IP address from the delegated prefix, this name
	  server cannot even be configured until it has an IP address.
	  The process of configuring this name server is beyond the scope
	  of the document; however, once the name server has been
	  configured, the requesting router SHOULD send a DHCP Renew
	  message for the delegated prefix with an IA_PD containing a PDZS
	  option that lists the IP address of this name server.
	</t>
	<t>
	  In general, if there are any globally-reachable name servers
	  that are authoritative for the zone or zones that provide the
	  reverse tree for the delegated prefix at the time that the DHCP
	  Request message is sent, the requesting router should list the
	  IP addresses of these name servers in the PDZS option in the
	  associated IA_PD option in the DHCP Request message.
	</t>
	<t>
	  If new globally-reachable name servers that are authoritative
	  for the reverse zone or zones become available after the DHCP
	  Request has been sent and the DHCP Reply received, the
	  requesting router SHOULD send a DHCP Renew message containing an
	  IA_PD for the delegated prefix and a PDZS option listing the
	  name servers for that prefix that have come online.  The
	  requesting router SHOULD be aware of all outstanding name server
	  configuration processes and minimize the number of DHCP Renew
	  message sent.
	</t>
	<t>
	  When a requesting router sends a DHCP Renew or DHCP Rebind message
	  to renew a delegated prefix, if a site-managed reverse tree was
	  successfully configured, the requesting router MUST send a PDZM
	  option containing the same method sent in the original DHCP Request
	  message.  The requesting router MUST also send a PDZS option that
	  contains one or more IP addresses for authoritative servers for the
	  reverse tree for the delegated prefix.
	</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Delegating Router Behavior">
	<t>
	  When a delegating router receives a valid DHCP Request message
	  containing an IA_PD that contains both a PDZM option indicating the
	  Site Managed method and a PDZS option containing at least one IP
	  address, it compares the IP addresses in the PDZM option to any
	  previous record it may have for that delegation.  If the contents of
	  the PDZM option differ from the previous record, or if there is no
	  previous record, the delegating router MUST issue a DNS Update to
	  add a delegation to the parent zone of the reverse tree zone for the
	  delegated prefix.
	</t>
	<t>
	  In the event that the PDZS option contains zero IP addresses, the
	  delegating router does not update the zone.
	</t>
	<t>
	  If the delegated prefix must be represented as more than one zone,
	  the delegating router adds delegations to the parent zone for each
	  such zone.
	</t>
	<t>
	  When a delegating router receives a DHCP Renew or DHCP Rebind
	  message for a prefix it delegated and elects to renew the
	  prefix, it MUST check its record for that prefix to see if a
	  delegation exists.  If the contents of the PDZS differ from the
	  recorded list of authoritative name servers for that prefix, the
	  delegating router MUST update the parent zone with the new
	  delegations.
	</t>
	<t>
	  When a delegating router receives a DHCP Renew or DHCP Rebind
	  message for a prefix it delegated, and elects not to renew the
	  delegation, the delegating router MUST check to see if it has a
	  site-managed reverse tree configuration for that pprefix.  If it
	  does, it must update the parent zone to remove any delegations that
	  were added, and update its record for the delegated prefix to
	  indicate that no site-managed reverse tree configuration for that
	  prefix is present.
	</t>
	<t>
	  When a delegated prefix expires without being renewed by the
	  requesting router, the same procedure should be followed to
	  update the parent zone.
	</t>
	<t>
	  In all cases where the delegating router updates the
	  delegation for the zone, it must first query the name server
	  or servers listed in the PDZS opton for an SOA record for
	  each delegated zone.  If the name server does not respond
	  within the standard timeout period, or does not provide an
	  authoritative answer, the delegating router MUST NOT add a
	  delegation for that name server.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section title="Configuring a provider-managed reverse tree">
      <t>
	If the PDZM returned by a delegating router in the DHCP Advertise
	message specifies the Provider Managed method, the delegating
	router must arrange to set up a reverse zone for the delegated
	prefix.  The requesting router must communicate a key to the
	delegating router that can be used to secure updates to the
	reverse zone.
      </t>
      <section title="Requesting Router Behavior">
	<t>
	  In order to update the provider-managed reverse zone, the
	  requesting router must provide a key to the delegating router.
	  Because DHCP does not provide confidentiality, this key must
	  be the public half of a private key.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Typically sites that wish to populate their reverse tree with
	  meaningful information maintain a site-specific or company-wide
	  DNS zone.  In order to update the reverse zone, the site
	  administrator must publish a SIG(0) key in this zone.  The
	  requesting router MUST include a Prefix Delegation SIG(0) Key
	  FQDN (PDSKF) option in the DHCP Request message and any
	  subsequent DHCP Renew messages.  It must use the private half of
	  the SIG(0) key in any DNS updates to the reverse zone.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Delegating Router Behavior">
	<t>
	  There are two cases that the delegating router needs to handle:
	  the case where the prefix being delegated was previously
	  delegated to the same requesting router, and the case where it
	  was not.
	</t>
	<t>
	  In the case where the prefix was previously delegated to the same
	  requesting router, the delegating router need take no action to
	  populate the zone, because it should already be populated.
	</t>
	<t>
	  In the case where the prefix was previously delegated to a
	  different requesting router, the delegating router MUST remove the
	  old zone information from the master authoritative name server for
	  the zone.
	</t>
	<t>
	  In this case, and in the case where no previous delegation had
	  been done, the delegating router must then configure a new reverse
	  zone on the master server.
	</t>
	<t>
	  In any case, the delegating router must configure the reverse
	  zone so that it can be updated using the SIG(0) key stored on
	  the name provided by the requesting router in the PDSKF option.
	</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Configuring a spoofed reverse tree">
      <t>
	A spoofed reverse tree can be configured either unilaterally
	by the service provider or upon request of the site
	administrator.  The site administrator would list this as an
	option to indicate a preference for a spoofed reverse tree
	over no reverse tree; the choice doesn't make any sense
	otherwise.
      </t>
      <t>
	Generally speaking, the service provider has the option of
	either setting up spoofed zones on demand, or setting them up
	when requested.  If the service provider only offers spoofed
	zones, it makes some sense to set them up in advance;
	otherwise they should be set up whenever a prefix is delegated
	to a particular requesting router for the first time.
      </t>
      <t>
	In some cases the site administration may request a spoofed
	zone because they do not wish to populate the reverse tree,
	but wish for it to appear populated.  A service provider may
	support this option in addition to the site-managed option,
	the provider-managed option, and the no zone option.  In this
	case, when a prefix is delegated to a new router for the first
	time, there may be an old zone configured differently.  In
	this case, the delegated router MUST remove the old zone
	configuration before setting up the spoofed zone.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Configuring no reverse tree">
      <t>
	A service provider may choose to simply not populate reverse
	trees for delegated prefixes.  This is a desirable option in
	the sense that it minimizes the work required to support the
	reverse DNS tree, and avoids creating spoofed nonsense
	records.  The service provider may also simply offer it as an
	option for sites that prefer not to have a populated reverse
	tree.
      </t>
      <t>
	In this case, if the non-populated reverse tree is an option,
	and the prefix had previously been delegated to a different
	router, the delegating router must remove any
	previously-existing zone for the delegated prefix.

	  The Prefix Delegation Zone Server option consists of an
	  option code, OPT_PDZS, followed by a length, followed by
	  zero or more IPv6 addresses.

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>	
Some ISPs may have concerns about allowing site-managed DNS
	subdelegations for the reverse zone, but this concern is a
	policy issue, not a security issue.  In the presence of
	properly agreed-to terms of service, population of a reverse
	tree by the end-user is simply a value-added service the ISP
	may or may not choose to provide.  Even in the absence of a
	legally binding ToS agreement, the worse an end-user could do
	would be to publish nasty words or bogus PTR records, neither
	of which is a security concern.
      </t>
      <t>
	If an implementation were to fail to follow the advice on
	validating authoritative name servers supplied by the
	requesting router, it would probably be possible for a
	coordinated set of requesting routers to perform a DDoS attack
	on a target by arranging for various entities on the network
	to query the reverse tree for one or more of the IP addresses
	in the delegated prefix.  However, this would require, first,
	that the implementation not follow the specification, and
	second, a fairly complicated setup.  In practice, there are
	easier ways to get a DDoS amplification.
      </t>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>
	We request that IANA assign three new option codes from the
	DHCP Option Codes table of the Dynamic Host Configuration
	Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) parameters registry maintained in
	http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters/dhcpv6-parameters.xml
	These option codes will be assigned to the Prefix Delegation
	Zone Preference (OPT_PDZP), Prefix Delegation Zone Method
	(OPT_PDZM) and Prefix Delegation Zone Servers (OPT_PDZS)
	options.
      </t>
      <t>
	We also request that the IANA add a new table, the Prefix
	Delegation Zone Method Types table, to the same registry.  The
	first three entries in the table will contain the values
	specified in the section above titled "Prefix Delegation Zone
	Method Types."  New entries to the table may be added according
	to the <xref target="RFC5226">"Specification Required" IANA
	policy</xref>.
