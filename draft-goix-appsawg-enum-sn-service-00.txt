Internet-Draft        Enum Service SN registration            March 2012


1.  Introduction

   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, [RFC6116]) is a system that uses DNS
   (Domain Name Service, [RFC1034]) to translate telephone numbers, such
   as '+39026210000', into URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers,
   [RFC3986], such as 'acct:user@example.com'.  ENUM exists primarily to
   facilitate the interconnection of systems that rely on telephone
   numbers with those that use URIs to identify resources.

   Social Networking (SN) services allow users to post and retrieve
   activities, typically representing status udpates, media uploads or
   follow-up actions, such as comments or likes.
   [I-D.jones-appsawg-webfinger] is proposing a generic URI to identify
   an SN service account for a particular resource: the 'acct:' URI
   scheme.

   This document registers an enumservice for advertising SN information
   associated with an E.164 number.

1.1.  Justification

   The requirement to map an SN account with an E.164 number is from the
   Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Mobile Social Networking Enabler Release
   [OMA-MobSocNet-ER].

   In Mobile networks, users are traditionally identified through a
   Mobile Subscriber ISDN (MSISDN) number.  In order to provide SN
   functionality to mobile subscribers identified by their MSISDN, a
   mapping is needed to identify the corresponding SN account and
   provider.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  IANA Registration

   As defined in [RFC6117], the following is a template covering
   information needed for the registration of the enumservice specified
   in this document:

   Question: should the subtype/URI schemes include explicitely "acct",
   "http"? (in case the http URI scheme is allowed as well)


3.  Examples

   The following is an example of the use of the enumservice registered
   by this document in a NAPTR resource record.

   $ORIGIN 7.6.5.4.3.2.1.5.3.3.9.3.e164.arpa.

   IN NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+acct" "!^.*$!acct:john.doe@example.com!" .

4.  DNS Considerations

   As per [RFC6116] section 2 the specific domain apex (domain name)
   depends on the administrative control of the ENUM implementation.  As
   such, private domains (e.g. e164.example.com) are allowed by this
   specification.

   If no "E2U+acct" NAPTR record exist for the requested number, the
   resolution process may be recursively performed in case of "E2U+
   pstn:tel" to support, amongst others, number portability as per
   [RFC4769], Section 4.


5.  Security Considerations

   DNS, as used by ENUM, is a global, distributed database.  Should
   implementers of this specification use e164.arpa or any other
   publicly available domain as the tree for maintaining PSTN
   Enumservice data, this information would be visible to anyone
   anonymously.

   As noted earlier, carriers, service providers, and other users may
   simply choose not to publish such information in the public e164.arpa
   tree.  They may instead simply publish this in their internal ENUM
   routing database that is only able to be queried by trusted elements
   of their network.  They may also choose to publish such information
   in a carrier-only branch of the e164.arpa tree, should one be
   created.

   Per se, this enumservice does not introduce specific security
   considerations beyond [RFC6116], section 7.  However, it has to be
   acknowledged that the proposed Enumservice could lead to the
   discovery or disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
   if used in combination with the WebFinger protocol.  Please see
   [I-D.jones-appsawg-webfinger] , section 7 for additional information
   regarding WebFinger security to avoid unwanted disclosure of
   information.

   Similar security concerns are associated with potential attacks
   against an underlying Social Networking system.  Unlike a traditional
   telephone number, and as per the indirect nature of SN communication
   (typically through an activity wall), the resource identified by an
   'acct:' URI may not be subject to direct communication with other
   peers.  However (e.g. in case of private message exchange) it may
   require that peers provide cryptographic credentials for
   authentication and authorization before messages are exchanged.  For
   this reason, SN protocols should have a number of security
   requirements that call for authentication, integrity and

   confidentiality properties, and similar measures to prevent such
   attacks.  [As such, any Social Networking protocol used in
   conjunction with the 'acct:' URI scheme is required to meet these
   requirements.  Question: is it the right place to say this?]


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the IANA registration of the Enumservice with
   Type "sn" according to the definitions in this document, [RFC6116]
   and [RFC6117].

   Details of the registration are given in Section 2.
