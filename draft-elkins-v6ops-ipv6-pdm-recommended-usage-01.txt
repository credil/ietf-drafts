                  Recommended Usage of IPv6 PDM Option
            draft-elkins-v6ops-ipv6-pdm-recommended-usage-01


Abstract

   To diagnose performance and connectivity problems, metrics on real
   (non-synthetic) transmission are critical for timely end-to-end
   problem resolution. Such diagnostics may be real-time or after the
   fact, but must not impact an operational production network. The base
   metrics are: packet sequence number and packet timestamp.  Metrics
   derived from these will be described separately. This document
   details the recommended usage for the IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic
   Metrics Destination Option (PDM).

1  Introduction

   To diagnose performance and connectivity problems, metrics on real
   (non-synthetic) transmission are critical for timely end-to-end
   problem resolution. Such diagnostics may be real-time or after the
   fact, but must not impact an operational production network. The base
   metrics are: packet sequence number and packet timestamp.  Metrics
   derived from these will be described separately.

   For background, please see draft-ackermann-tictoc-pdm-ntp-usage-00
   [ACKPDM], draft-elkins-6man-ipv6-pdm-dest-option-02 [ELKPDM], draft-
   elkins-v6ops-ipv6-packet-sequence-needed-01 [ELKPSN], draft-elkins-
   v6ops-ipv6-end-to-end-rt-needed-01 [ELKRSP], and draft-elkins-ippm-
   pdm-metrics-00 [ELKIPPM]. These drafts are companions to this
   document.    

   As discussed in the above Internet Drafts, current methods are
   inadequate for these purposes because they assume unreasonable access
   to intermediate devices, are cost prohibitive, require infeasible
   changes to a running production network, or do not provide timely
   data. The IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics destination option
   (PDM) provides a solution to these problems.  This document will
   discuss how best to use the PDM.

2 How to use Packet Sequence Number

   In many large Enterprise Networks, during network diagnostics of an
   end-to-end connection, it becomes necessary to find the device along
   the path creating problems.  Diagnostic data may be collected at
   multiple places along the path (if possible), or at the source and
   destination. Then, the diagnostic data must be matched.  Packet
   sequence number is critical in this matching process.  In IPv4
   networks, the IPID field was used as a DeFacto sequence number.  This
   was discussed at length in draft-elkins-v6ops-ipv6-packet-sequence-
   needed-01 [ELKPSN].

   The packet sequence number provided in the PDM may be used in large
   multi-tier networks to see where the packet loss or packet corruption
   is happening.  Multi-tier networks are those which have multiple
   routers or switches on the path between the sender and the receiver.

2.1 Limitations of Packet Capture

   As discussed in draft-elkins-v6ops-ipv6-packet-sequence-needed-01
   [ELKPSN], the only instrumentation which provides enough detail to
   diagnose end-to-end problems is a packet trace.  Even though packets
   are the only reliable way to provide data at the needed granularity,
   there are limitations in operations on live production networks.  How
   packet sequence number can alleviate the limitations are detailed
   below the problem description.

2.1.1 Problem Scenario 1

   1. Packets are captured for analysis at places like large core
   switches.  All packets are kept.  Again, not necessarily for
   diagnostic reasons but for regulatory.  (Ex.  Records of all stock
   trades may need to be kept for a certain number of years.) 

   2. When there is a problem, an analyst extracts the needed
   information.

   3. If the extract is done incorrectly, as often happens, or the
   packet capture itself is incorrect, then there are false duplicate
   packets which can be quite misleading and can lead to wrong
   conclusions. Are these real TCP duplicates?  Is there congestion on
   the subnet? Are these retransmissions?  Situations have been seen
   where routers incorrectly send two packets instead of one - is this
   such a situation?

2.1.2 Problem Scenario 2

   Packet captures can be misleading for another.

   1. In this scenario, packets are captured for analysis at places like
   a middleware box. The reason this is done is because problems are
   suspected with the box itself.

   2. The box may not offer any way to tailor the packet capture.  "You
   will get what we give you, how we give it to you!" is their
   philosophy,

   3. The packet capture incorrectly duplicates only packets going to
   certain nodes.  So, it is not possible to devise an algorithm or
   pattern whereby certain packets can be ignored

   4. Again, there are false duplicate packets which can be misleading
   and can lead to wrong conclusions. Are these real TCP duplicates?  Is
   there congestion on the subnet?  Situations have been seen where
   routers incorrectly send two packets instead of one - is this such a

   situation?

2.1.3 Packet Sequence Number Provides Solution

   If a packet is a duplicate sent by a stack at a source host, the
   packet sequence number will not be the same. If a duplicate packet is
   seen with the same packet sequence number, it can be safely assumed
   that this is a 'false' duplicate and can be ignored.

2.2 Packet Sequence Number Replaces IPv4 IPID DeFacto Diagnostic
   Function

   draft-elkins-v6ops-ipv6-packet-sequence-needed-01 [ELKPSN] discussed 
   a number of use cases where the IPv4 IPID reduced the time to 
   diagnose problems on networks. The packet sequence number in the PDM 
   will serve the same function for IPv6. The recommendation is to have 
   the PDM used for all packets for all protocols so that timely 
   diagnosis can occur.

3 How to use the Timestamp

   The timestamp contained in the PDM traveling along with the packet
   will be used to calculate end-to-end response time without requiring
   agents in devices along the path. The need for end-to-end response
   time, the background and current methods are discussed in draft-
   draft-elkins-v6ops-ipv6-end-to-end-rt-needed-01 [ELKRSP].

3.1 Time Synchronization

   The timestamp used in the PDM is compatible with the Network Time
   Protocol (NTP) [RFC5905].  Many networks use NTP pervasively
   today.  We recommend use of NTP so that the matching of timestamps
   and calculations of deltas can be easily done.

3.2 Response Time for Service Level Agreements

   In Networks, end-to-end response times are a critical component
   of Service Levels Agreements (SLAs). So, the recommended use of the
   PDM is to have it turned on for all applications which require SLAs
   and / or have a requirement for timely transmission.

3.3 Trending

   In addition to the need for tracking current service, end-to-end
   response time is valuable for capacity planning.  By tracking
   response times, and identifying trends, it becomes possible to
   determine when network capacity is being approached.  To allow
   tracking of trends in response time, we recommend having the PDM used

   for applications which may need additional capacity so that summary
   data on response times and their distributions can be maintained. 


4 Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations.


5 IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations.
