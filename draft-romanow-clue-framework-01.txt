Internet-Draft         CLUE Telepresence Framework          October 2011


1.  Introduction

   Current telepresence systems, though based on open standards such as
   RTP [RFC3550] and SIP [RFC3261], cannot easily interoperate with each
   other.  A major factor limiting the interoperability of telepresence
   systems is the lack of a standardized way to describe and negotiate
   the use of the multiple streams of audio and video comprising the
   media flows.  This draft provides a framework for a protocol to
   enable interoperability by handling multiple streams in a
   standardized way.  It is intended to support the use cases described
   in draft-ietf-clue-telepresence-use-cases-00 and to meet the
   requirements in draft-romanow-clue-requirements-xx.

   The solution described here is strongly focused on what is being done
   today, rather than on a vision of future conferencing.  At the same
   time, the highest priority has been given to creating an extensible
   framework to make it easy to accommodate future conferencing
   functionality as it evolves.

   The purpose of this effort is to make it possible to handle multiple
   streams of media in such a way that a satisfactory user experience is
   possible even when participants are on different vendor equipment and
   when they are using devices with different types of communication
   capabilities.  Information about the relationship of media streams
   must be communicated so that audio/video rendering can be done in the
   best possible manner.  In addition, it is necessary to choose which
   media streams are sent.

   There is no attempt here to dictate to the renderer what it should
   do.  What the renderer does is up to the renderer.

   After the following Definitions, two short sections introduce key
   concepts.  The body of the text comprises three sections that deal
   with in turn stream content, choosing streams and an implementation
   example.  The media provider and media consumer behavior are
   described in separate sections as well.  Several appendices describe
   further details for using the framework.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft         CLUE Telepresence Framework          October 2011


3.  Definitions

   The definitions marked with an "*" are new; all the others are from
   draft-wenger-clue-definitions-00-01.txt.

   *Audio Capture: Media Capture for audio.  Denoted as ACn.

   Capture Device: A device that converts audio and video input into an
   electrical signal, in most cases to be fed into a media encoder.
   Cameras and microphones are examples for capture devices.

   Capture Scene: the scene that is captured by a collection of Capture
   Devices.  A Capture Scene may be represented by more than one type of
   Media.  A Capture Scene may include more than one Media Capture of
   the same type.  An example of a Capture Scene is the video image of a
   group of people seated next to each other, along with the sound of
   their voices, which could be represented by some number of VCs and
   ACs.  A middle box may also express Capture Scenes that it constructs
   from Media streams it receives.

   A Capture Set includes Media Captures that all represent some aspect
   of the same Capture Scene.  The items (rows) in a Capture Set
   represent different alternatives for representing the same Capture
   Scene.

   Conference: used as defined in [RFC4353], A Framework for
   Conferencing within the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).

   Individual Encode: A variable with a set of attributes that describes
   the maximum values of a single audio or video capture encoding.  The
   attributes include: maximum bandwidth- and for video maximum
   macroblocks, maximum width, maximum height, maximum frame rate.
   [Edt. These are based on H.264.]

   *Encoding Group: Encoding group: A set of encoding parameters
   representing a device's complete encoding capabilities or a
   subdivision of them.  Media stream providers formed of multiple
   physical units, in each of which resides some encoding capability,
   would typically advertise themselves to the remote media stream
   consumer as being formed multiple encoding groups.  Within each
   encoding group, multiple potential actual encodings are possible,
   with the sum of those encodings' characteristics constrained to being
   less than or equal to the group-wide constraints.

   Endpoint: The logical point of final termination through receiving,
   decoding and rendering, and/or initiation through capturing,
   encoding, and sending of media streams.  An endpoint consists of one
   or more physical devices which source and sink media streams, and



Romanow, et al.           Expires April 5, 2012                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         CLUE Telepresence Framework          October 2011


   exactly one [RFC4353] Participant (which, in turn, includes exactly
   one SIP User Agent).  In contrast to an endpoint, an MCU may also
   send and receive media streams, but it is not the initiator nor the
   final terminator in the sense that Media is Captured or Rendered.
   Endpoints can be anything from multiscreen/multicamera rooms to
   handheld devices.

   Endpoint Characteristics: include placement of Capture and Rendering
   Devices, capture/render angle, resolution of cameras and screens,
   spatial location and mixing parameters of microphones.  Endpoint
   characteristics are not specific to individual media streams sent by
   the endpoint.

   Left: For media captures, left and right is from the point of view of
   a person observing the rendered media.

   MCU: Multipoint Control Unit (MCU) - a device that connects two or
   more endpoints together into one single multimedia conference
   [RFC5117].  An MCU includes an [RFC4353] Mixer.  [Edt. RFC4353 is
   tardy in requiring that media from the mixer be sent to EACH
   participant.  I think we have practical use cases where this is not
   the case.  But the bug (if it is one) is in 4353 and not herein.

   Media: Any data that, after suitable encoding, can be conveyed over
   RTP, including audio, video or timed text.

   *Media Capture: a source of Media, such as from one or more Capture
   Devices.  A Media Capture may be the source of one or more Media
   streams.  A Media Capture may also be constructed from other Media
   streams.  A middle box can express Media Captures that it constructs
   from Media streams it receives.

   *Media Consumer: an Endpoint or middle box that receives Media
   streams

   *Media Provider: an Endpoint or middle box that sends Media streams

   Model: a set of assumptions a telepresence system of a given vendor
   adheres to and expects the remote telepresence system(s) also to
   adhere to.

   Right: For media captures, left and right is from the point of view
   of a person observing the rendered media.

   Render: the process of generating a representation from a media, such
   as displayed motion video or sound emitted from loudspeakers.

   *Simultaneous Transmission Set: a set of media captures that can be



Romanow, et al.           Expires April 5, 2012                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         CLUE Telepresence Framework          October 2011


   transmitted simultaneously from a Media Provider.

   Spatial Relation: The arrangement in space of two objects, in
   contrast to relation in time or other relationships.  See also Left
   and Right.

   *Stream: RTP stream as in [RFC3550].

   Stream Characteristics: include media stream attributes commonly used
   in non-CLUE SIP/SDP environments (such as: media codec, bit rate,
   resolution, profile/level etc.) as well as CLUE specific attributes
   (which could include for example and depending on the solution found:
   the I-D or spatial location of a capture device a stream originates
   from).

   Telepresence: an environment that gives non co-located users or user
   groups a feeling of (co-located) presence - the feeling that a Local
   user is in the same room with other Local users and the Remote
   parties.  The inclusion of Remote parties is achieved through
   multimedia communication including at least audio and video signals
   of high fidelity.

   *Video Capture: Media Capture for video.  Denoted as VCn.

   Video composite: A single image that is formed from combining visual
   elements from separate sources.


4.  Framework Features

   Two key functions must be accomplished so that multiple media streams
   can be handled in a telepresence conference.  These are:

   o  How to choose which streams the provider should send to the
      consumer

   o  What information needs to be added to the streams to allow a
      rendering of the capture scene

   The framework/model we present here can be understood as specifying
   these two functions.

   Media stream providers and consumers are central to the framework.
   The provider's job is to advertise its capabilities (as described
   here) to the consumer, whose job it is to configure the provider's
   encoding capabilities as described below.  Both providers and
   consumers can each send and receive information, that is, we do not
   have one party as the provider and one as the consumer exclusively,



Romanow, et al.           Expires April 5, 2012                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         CLUE Telepresence Framework          October 2011


   but all parties have both sending and receiving parts to them.  Most
   devices function as both a media provider and as a media consumer.

   For two devices to communicate bidirectionally, with media flowing in
   both directions, both devices act as both a media provider and a
   media consumer.  The protocol exchange shown later in the "Choosing
   Streams" section happens twice independently between the 2
   bidirectional devices.

   Both endpoints and MCUs, or more generally "middleboxes", can be
   media providers and consumers.

   Generally, the provider is capable of sending alternate captures of a
   capture scene.  These are described by the provider as capabilities
   and chosen by the consumer.


5.  Stream Information

   This section describes the structure for communicating information
   between providers and consumers.  Figure illustrates how information
   to be communicated is organized.  Each construct illustrated in the
   diagram is discussed in the sections below.

5.1.  Media capture -- Audio and Video

   A media capture, as defined in definitions, is a fundamental concept
   of the model.  Media can be captured in different ways, for example
   by various arrangements of cameras and microphones.  The model uses
   the terms "video capture" (VC) and "audio capture" (AC) to refer to
   sources of media streams.  To distinguish between multiple instances,
   they are numbered for example VC1, VC2, and VC3 could refer to three
   different video captures which can be used simultaneously.

   Media captures are dynamic.  They can come and go in a conference -
   and their parameters can change.  A provider can advertise a new list
   of captures at any time.  Both the media provider and media consumer
   can send "their messages" (i.e., capture set advertisements, stream
   configurations) any number of times during a call, and the other end
   is always required to act on any new information received (e.g.,
   stopping streams it had previously configured that are no longer
   valid).

   A media capture can be a media source such as video from a specific
   camera, or it can be more conceptual such as a composite image from
   several cameras, or an automatic dynamically switched capture
   choosing from several cameras depending on who is talking or other
   factors.

   A media capture is described by Attributes and associated with an
   Encode Group, and Physical Simultaneity Set.

   Audio and video captures are aggregated into Capture Sets as
   described below.

5.2.  Attributes

   Audio and video capture attributes describe information about streams
   and their relationships.  [Edt: We do not mean to duplicate SDP, if
   an SDP description can be used, great.]  The attributes of media
   captures refer to static aspects of those captures that can be used
   by the consumer for selecting the captures offered by the provider.

   The mechanism of Attributes make the framework extensible.  Although
   we are defining some attributes now based on the most common use
   cases, new attributes can be added for new use cases as they arise.
   In general, the way to extend the solution to handle new features is
   by adding attributes and/or values.

   We describe attributes by variables and their values.  The current
   attributes are listed below and then described.  The variable is
   shown in parentheses, and the values follow after the colon:

   o  (Purpose): main, presentation

   o  (Audio mixed): true, false

   o  (Audio Channel Format): mono, stereo, tbd

   o  (Area of Capture): A set of 'Ranges' describing the relevant area
      being capture by a capture device

   o  (Point of Capture): A 'Point' describing the location of the
      capture device or pseudo-device

   o  (Area scale): true, false indicating if area numbers are in
      millimeters

   o  (Video composed): true, false

   o  (Auto-switched): true, false

5.2.1.  Purpose

   A variable with enumerated values describing the purpose or role of
   the Media Capture.  It could be applied to any media type.  Possible
   values: main, presentation, others TBD.

   Main:

   The audio or video capture is of one or more people participating in
   a conference (or where they would be if they were there).  It is of
   part or all of the Capture Scene.

   Presentation:

   The stream provides a presentation, e. g., from a connected laptop or
   other input device.

5.2.2.  Audio mixed

   A Boolean variable to indicate whether the AC is a mix of other ACs
   or Streams.

5.2.3.  Audio Channel Format

   The "channel format" attribute of an Audio Capture indicates how the
   meaning of the channels is determined.  It is an enumerated variable
   describing the type of audio channel or channels in the Audio
   Capture.  The possible values of the "channel format" attribute are:




Romanow, et al.           Expires April 5, 2012                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft         CLUE Telepresence Framework          October 2011


   o  mono

   o  stereo

   o  TBD - other possible future values (to potentially include other
      things like 3.0, 3.1, 5.1 surround sound and binaural)

   All ACs in the same row of a Capture Set MUST have the same value of
   the "channel format" attribute.

   There can be multiple ACs of a particular type, or even different
   types.  These multiple ACs could each have an area of capture
   attribute to indicate they represent different areas of the capture
   scene.

   If there are multiple audio streams, they might be correlated (that
   is, someone talking might be heard in multiple captures from the same
   room).  Echo cancellation and stream synchronization in consumers
   should take this into account.

   Mono:

   An AC with channel format="mono" has one audio channel.

   Stereo:

   An AC with channel format = "stereo" has exactly two audio channels,
   left and right, as part of the same AC.  [Edt: should we mention RFC
   3551 here?  The channel format may be related to how Audio Captures
   are mapped to RTP streams.  This stereo is not the same as the effect
   produced from two mono ACs one from the left and one from the right.

5.2.4.  Area of capture

   The area_of_capture attribute is used to describe the relevant area
   of which a media capture is "capturing".  By comparing the area of
   capture for different media captures, a consumer can determine the
   spatial relationships of the captures on the provider so that they
   can be rendered correctly.  The attribute consists of a set of
   'Ranges', one range for each spatial dimension, where each range has
   a Begin and End coordinate.  It is not necessary to fill out all of
   the dimensions if they are not relevant (i.e. if an endpoint's
   captures only span a single dimension, only the 'x' coordinate can be
   used).  There is no need to pre-define a possible range for this
   coordinate system; a device may choose what is most appropriate for
   describing its captures.  However, it is specified that as numbers
   move from lower to higher, the location is going from: left to right

   (in the case of the 'x' dimension), front to back (in the case of the
   'y' dimension or low to high (in the case of the 'z' dimension).

5.2.5.  Point of capture

   The point_of_capture attribute can be used to describe the location
   of a capture device or pseudo-device.  If there are multiple captures
   which share the same 'area_of_capture' value, then it is useful to
   know the location from which they are capturing that area (e.g. a
   device which has multiview).  Point of capture is expressed as a
   single {x, y, z} coordinate where, as with area_of_capture, only the
   necessary dimensions need be expressed.

5.2.6.  Area Scale Millimeters

   An optional Boolean variable indicating if the numbers used for area
   of capture and point of capture are in terms of millimeters.  If this
   attribute is true, then the x,y,z numbers represent millimeters.  If
   this attribute is false, then there is no physical scale.  The
   default value is false.

5.2.7.  Video composed

   An optional Boolean variable indicating if the VC is constructed by
   composing multiple other video captures together.  (This could
   indicate for example a continuous presence view of multiple images in
   a grid, or a large image with smaller picture-in-picture images in
   it.)

   Note: this attribute is not intended to differentiate between
   different ways of composing images.  For possible extension of the
   framework, additional attributes could be defined to distinguish
   between different ways of composing images, with different video
   layout arrangements of composing multiple images into one.

5.2.8.  Auto-switched

   A Boolean variable that may be used or audio and/or video streams.
   In this case the offered AC or VC varies depending on some rule; it
   is auto-switched between possible VCs, or between possible ACs.  The
   most common example of this is sending the video capture associated
   with the "loudest" speaker according to an audio detection algorithm.

5.3.  Capture Set

   A capture set describes the alternative media streams that the
   provider offers to send to the consumer.  As shown in the content
   diagram above, the capture set is an aggregation of all audio and



Romanow, et al.           Expires April 5, 2012                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft         CLUE Telepresence Framework          October 2011


   video captures for a particular scene that a provider is willing to
   send.

   A provider describes its ability to send alternative media streams in
   the capture set, which lists the media captures in rows, as shown
   below.  Each row of the capture set consists of either a single
   capture or a group of captures.  A group means the individual
   captures in the group are spatially related with the specific
   ordering of the captures described through the use of attributes.

   Here is an example of a simple capture set with three video captures
   and three audio channels:

      (VC0, VC1, VC2)

      (AC0, AC1, AC2)

   The three VCs together in a row indicate those captures are spatially
   related to each other.  Similarly for the 3 ACs in the second row.
   The ACs and VCs in the same capture set are spatially related to each
   other.

   Multiple Media Captures of the same media type are often spatially
   related to each other.  Typically multiple Video Captures should be
   rendered next to each other in a particular order, or multiple audio
   channels should be rendered to match different speakers in a
   particular way.  Also, media of different types are often associated
   with each other, for example a group of Video Captures can be
   associated with a group of Audio Captures meaning they should be
   rendered together.

   Media Captures of the same media type are associated with each other
   by grouping them together in a single row of a Capture Set. Media
   Captures of different media types are associated with each other by
   putting them in different rows of the same Capture Set.

   Since all captures have an area_of_capture associated with them, a
   consumer can determine the spatial relationships of captures by
   comparing the locations of their areas of capture with one another.

   Association between audio and video can be made by finding audio and
   video captures which share overlapping areas of capture.

   The items (rows) in a capture set represent different alternatives
   for representing the same Capture Scene.  For example the following
   are alternative ways of capturing the same Capture Scene - two
   cameras each viewing half of a room, or one camera viewing the whole
   room, or one stream that automatically captures the person in the



Romanow, et al.           Expires April 5, 2012                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft         CLUE Telepresence Framework          October 2011


   room who is currently speaking.  Each row of the Capture Set contains
   either a single media capture or one group of media captures.

   The following example shows a capture set for an endpoint media
   provider where:

   o  (VC0, VC1, VC2) - left camera capture, center camera capture,
      right camera capture

   o  (VC3) - capture associated with loudest

   o  (VC4) - zoomed out view of all people in the room

   o  (AC0) - main audio

   The first item in this capture set example is a group of video
   captures with a spatial relationship to each other.  These are VC0,
   VC1, and VC2.  VC3 and VC4 are additional alternatives of how to
   capture the same room in different ways.  The audio capture is
   included in the same capture set to indicate AC0 is associated with
   those video captures, meaning the audio should be rendered along with
   the video in the same set.

   The idea is to have sets of captures that represent the same
   information ("information" in this context might be a set of people
   and their associated audio / video streams, or might be a
   presentation supplied by a laptop, perhaps with an accompanying audio
   commentary).  Spatial ordering of media captures is described through
   the use of attributes.

   A media consumer could choose one row of each media type (e.g., audio
   and video) from a capture set.  For example a three stream consumer
   could choose the first video row plus the audio row, while a single
   stream consumer could choose the second or third video row plus the
   audio row.  An MCU consumer might choose to receive multiple rows.

   The groupsSimultaneous Transmission Set and Encoding Groups as
   discussed in the next section apply to media captures listed in
   capture sets.  The groupsSimultaneous Transmission Sets and Encoding
   Groups MUST allow all the Media Captures in a particular row of the
   capture set to be used simultaneously.  But media captures in
   different rows of the capture set might not be able to be used
   simultaneously.


6.  Choosing Streams

   This section describes the process of choosing which streams the

   provider sends to the consumer.  In order for appropriate streams to
   be sent from providers to consumers, certain characteristics of the
   multiple streams must be understood by both providers and consumers.
   Two separate aspects of streams suffice to describe the necessary
   information to be shared by providers and consumers.  The first
   aspect we call "physical simultaneity" and the other aspect we refer
   to as "encoding group".  These are described in the following
   sections, after the message flow is discussed.

6.1.  Message Flow

   The following diagram shows the flow of messages between a media
   provider and a media consumer.  The provider sends information about
   its capabilities (as specified in this section), then the consumer
   chooses which streams it wants, which we refer to as "configure".
   The consumer sends its own capability message to the provider which
   may contain information about its own capabilities or restrictions,
   in which case the provider might tailor its announcements to the
   consumer.

          |                                     |

6.1.1.  Provider Capabilities Announcement

   The provider capabilities announce message includes:

   o  the list of captures and their attributes

   o  the list of capture sets

   o  the list of Simultaneous Transmission Sets

   o  the list of the encoding groups

Internet-Draft         CLUE Telepresence Framework          October 2011


6.1.2.  Consumer Capability Message

   In order for a maximally-capable provider to be able to advertise a
   manageable number of video captures to a consumer, there is a
   potential use for the consumer being able, at the start of CLUE to be
   able to inform the provider of its capabilities.  One example here
   would be the video capture attribute set - a consumer could tell the
   provider the complete set of video capture attributes it is able to
   understand and so the provider would be able to reduce the capture
   set it advertises to be tailored to the consumer.

   TBD - the content of this message needs to be better defined.  The
   authors believe there is a need for this message, but have not worked
   out the details yet.

6.1.3.  Consumer Configure Request

   After receiving a set of video capture information from a provider
   and making its choice of what media streams to receive based on the
   consumer's own capabilities and any provider-side simultaneity
   restrictions, the consumer needs to essentially configure the
   provider to transmit the chosen set.

   The expectation is that this message will enumerate each of the
   encoding groups and potential encoders within those groups that the
   consumer wishes to be active (this may well be a subset of the
   complete set available).  For each such encoder within an encoding
   group, the consumer would specify the video capture (i.e., VC<n> as
   described above) along with the specifics of the video encoding
   required, i.e. width, height, frame rate and bit rate.  At this
   stage, the consumer would also provide RTP demultiplexing information
   as required to distinguish each stream from the others being
   configured by the same mechanism.

6.2.  Physical Simultaneity

   An endpoint or MCU can send multiple captures simultaneously.
   However, there may be constraints that limit which captures can be
   sent simultaneously with other captures.

   Physical or device simultaneity refers to fact that a device may not
   be able to be used in different ways at the same time.  This shapes
   the way that offers are made from the provider.  The offers are made
   so that the consumer will choose one of several possible usages of
   the device.  This type of constraint is expressed in Simultaneous
   Transmission Sets.  This is easier to show in an example.

   Consider the example of a room system where there are 3 cameras each



Romanow, et al.           Expires April 5, 2012                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft         CLUE Telepresence Framework          October 2011


   of which can send a separate capture covering 2 persons each- VC0,
   VC1, VC2.  The middle camera can also zoom out and show all 6
   persons, VC3.  But the middle camera cannot be used in both modes at
   the same time - it has to either show the space where 2 participants
   sit or the whole 6 seats.  We refer to this as a physical device
   simultaneity constraint.

   The following illustration shows 3 cameras with 4 video streams.  The
   middle camera can be used as main video zoomed in on 2 people or it
   could be used in zoomed out mode and capture the whole endpoint.  The
   idea here is that the middle camera cannot be used for both zoomed in
   and zoomed out captures simultaneously.  This is a constraint imposed
   by the physical limitations of the devices.

   Diagram for Simultaneity

   `-.   +--------+   VC2
      .-'_Camera 3|---------->

   .-'   +--------+

   VC0- video zoomed in on 2 people   VC2- video zoomed in on 2 people
   VC1- video zoomed in on 2 people   VC3- video zoomed out on 6 people

   Simultaneous transmission sets can be expressed as sets of the VCs
   that could physically be transmitted at the same time, though it may
   not make sense to do so.

   In this example the two simultaneous sets are:

   {VC0, VC1, VC2}

   {VC0, VC3, VC2}

   In this example VC0, VC1 and VC2 can be sent OR VC0, VC3 and VC2.
   Only one set can be transmitted at a time.  These are physical
   capabilities describing what can physically be sent at the same time,
   not what might make sense to send.  For example, in the second set
   both VC0 and VC2 are redundant if VC3 is included.

Internet-Draft         CLUE Telepresence Framework          October 2011


   In describing its capabilities, the provider must take physical
   simultaneity into account and send a list of its Simultaneous
   Transmission Sets to the consumer, along with the Capture Sets and
   Encoding Groups.

6.3.  Encoding Groups

   The second aspect of multiple streams that must be understood by
   providers and consumers in order to create the best experience
   possible, i. e., for the "right" or "best" streams to be sent, is the
   encoding characteristics of the possible audio and video streams
   which can be sent.  Just as in the way that a constraint is imposed
   on the multiple streams due to the physical limitations, there are
   also constraints due to encoding limitations.  These are described by
   four variables that make up an Encoding Group, as shown in the
   following table:

   Table: Encoding Group

   +----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
   | Name           | Description                                      |
   +----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
   | maxBandwidth   | Maximum number of bits per second relating to    |
   |                | all encodes combined                             |
   | maxVideoMbps   | Maximum number of macroblocks per second         |
   |                | relating to a all video encodes combined ((width |
   |                | + 15) / 16) * ((height + 15) / 16) *             |
   |                | framesPerSecond                                  |
   | videoEncodes[] | Set of potential video encodes can be generated  |
   | audioEncodes[] | Set of potential encodes that can be generated   |
   +----------------+--------------------------------------------------+

   An encoding group is the basic concept for describing encoding
   capability.  As shown in the Table, it has an overall maxMbps and
   bandwidth limits, as well as being comprised of sets of individual
   encodes, which will be described in more detail below.

   Each media stream provider includes one or more encoding groups.
   There may be multiple encoding groups per endpoint.  For example,
   each video capture device might have an associated encoding group
   that describes the video streams that can result from that capture.

   A remote receiver (i. e., stream consumer)configures some or all of
   the specific encodings within one or more groups in order to provide
   it with media streams to decode.

6.3.1.  Encoding Group Structure

   This section shows more detail on the media stream provider's
   encoding group structure.  The encoding group includes several
   individual encodes, each has different encoding values.  For example
   one may be high definition video 1080p60, and another 720p30, with a
   third being CIF.  While a typical 3 codec/display system would have
   one encoding group per "box", there are many possibilities for the
   number of encoding groups a provider may be able offer and for what
   encoding values there are in each encoding group.

   |  | | | |           | ,---------.            |   |
   |  | | | |           | |         | ,---------.|   |

   |    `.| `-----------' `---------'            |   |
   |      `--------------------------------------'   |
   `-------------------------------------------------'

   As shown in the diagram, each encoding group has multiple potential
   individual encodes within it.  Not all encodes are equally capable,
   the stream consumer chooses the encodes it wants by configuring the
   provider to send it what it wants to receive.

   Some encoding endpoints are fixed, others are flexible, e. g., a
   single box with multiple DSPs where the resources are shared.

6.3.2.  Individual Encodes

   An encoding group is associated with a media capture through the
   individual encodes, that is, an audio or video capture is encoded in
   one or more individual encodes, as described by the videoEncodes[]
   and audioEncodes[]variables.

   The following table shows the variables for a Video Encode.  (There
   is a similar table for audio.)

   |              | to a single video encoding: ((width + 15) / 16) *  |

   | maxHeight    | Video resolution's maximum supported height,       |
   |              | expressed in pixels                                |
   | maxFrameRate | Maximum supported frame rate                       |
   +--------------+----------------------------------------------------+

   A remote receiver configures (i. e., instantiates) some or all of the
   specific encodes such that:

   o  The configuration of each active ENC<n> does not exceed that
      individual encode's maxWidth, maxHeight, maxFrameRate.

   o  The total bandwidth of the configured ENC<n&gtt; does not exceed
      the maxBandwidth of the encoding group.

   o  The sum of the macroblocks per second of each configured encode
      does not exceed the maxMbps attribute of the encoding group.

   An equivalent set of attributes holds for audio encodes within an
   audio encoding group.

6.3.3.  More on Encoding Groups

   An encoding group EG<n> comprises one or more potential encodings
   ENC<n>.  For example,

   EG0:  maxMbps=489600, maxBandwidth=6000000
        VIDEO_ENC0: maxWidth=1920, maxHeight=1088, maxFrameRate=60,
                    maxMbps=244800, maxBandwidth=4000000
        VIDEO_ENC1: maxWidth=1920, maxHeight=1088, maxFrameRate=60,
                    maxMbps=244800, maxBandwidth=4000000
        AUDIO_ENC0: maxBandwidth=96000
        AUDIO_ENC1: maxBandwidth=96000
        AUDIO_ENC2: maxBandwidth=96000

   Here, the encoding group is EG0.  It can transmit up to two 1080p30
   encodings (Mbps for 1080p = 244800), but it is capable of



Romanow, et al.           Expires April 5, 2012                [Page 20]

Internet-Draft         CLUE Telepresence Framework          October 2011


   transmitting a maxFrameRate of 60 frames per second (fps).  To
   achieve the maximum resolution (1920 x 1088) the frame rate is
   limited to 30 fps.  However 60 fps can be achieved at a lower
   resolution if required by the consumer.  Although the encoding group
   is capable of transmitting up to 6Mbit/s, no individual video
   encoding can exceed 4Mbit/s.

   This encoding group also allows up to 3 audio encodings,
   AUDIO_ENC<0-2>.  It is not required that audio and video encodings
   reside within the same encoding group, but if so then the group's
   overall maxBandwidth value is a limit on the sum of all audio and
   video encodings configured by the consumer.  A system that does not
   wish or need to combine bandwidth limitations in this way should
   instead use separate encoding groups for audio and video in order for
   the bandwidth limitations on audio and video to not interact.

   Audio and video can be expressed in separate encode groups, as in
   this illustration.

   VIDEO_EG0:  maxMbps=489600, maxBandwidth=6000000
        VIDEO_ENC0: maxWidth=1920, maxHeight=1088, maxFrameRate=60,
                    maxMbps=244800, maxBandwidth=4000000
        VIDEO_ENC1: maxWidth=1920, maxHeight=1088, maxFrameRate=60,
                    maxMbps=244800, maxBandwidth=4000000
   AUDIO_EG0: maxBandwidth=500000
        AUDIO_ENC0: maxBandwidth=96000
        AUDIO_ENC1: maxBandwidth=96000
        AUDIO_ENC2: maxBandwidth=96000

6.3.4.  Examples of Encoding Groups

   This section illustrates further examples of encoding groups.  In the
   first example, the capability parameters are the same across ENCs.
   In the second example, they vary.

   An endpoint that has 3 similar video capture devices would advertise
   3 encoding groups that can each transmit up to 2 1080p30 encodings,

   A remote consumer configures some or all of the specific encodings
   such that:

   o  The configuration of each active ENC<n> parameter values does not
      cause that encoding's maxWidth, maxHeight, maxFrameRate to be
      exceeded

   o  The total bandwidth of the configured ENC <n> encodings does not
      exceed the maxBandwidth of the encoding group

   o  The sum of the "macroblocks per second" values of each configured
      encoding does not exceed the maxMbps of the encoding group

   There is no requirement for all encodings within an encoding group to
   be activated when configured by the consumer.

   Depending on the provider's encoding methods, the consumer may be
   able to request fixed encode values or choose encode values in the
   range less than the maximum offered.  We will discuss consumer
   behavior in more detail in a section below.

6.3.4.1.  Sample video encoding group specification #2

   This example specification expresses a system whose encoding groups
   can each transmit up to 3 encodings, but with each potential encoding
   having a progressively lower specification.  In this example, 1080p60
   transmission is possible (as ENC0 has a maxMbps value compatible with
   that) as long as it is the only active encoding (as maxMbps for the
   entire encoding group is also 489600).  Significantly, as up to 3
   encodings are available per group, some sets of captures which
   weren't able to be transmitted simultaneously in example #1 above now
   become possible, for instance VC1, VC3 and VC6 together.  In common

   with example #1, all encoding groups have an identical specification.

   EG0:  maxMbps = 489600, maxBandwidth=6000000
       ENC0: maxWidth=1920, maxHeight=1088, maxFrameRate=60,
             maxMbps=489600, maxBandwidth=4000000
       ENC1: maxWidth=1280, maxHeight=720, maxFrameRate=30,
             maxMbps=108000, maxBandwidth=4000000

7.  Using the Framework

   This section shows in more detail how to use the framework to
   represent a typical case for telepresence rooms.  First an endpoint
   is illustrated, then an MCU case is shown.

   Consider an endpoint with the following characteristics:

   o  3 cameras, 3 displays, a 6 person table

   o  Each video device can provide one capture for each 1/3 section of
      the table

   o  A single capture representing the active speaker can be provided

   o  A single capture representing the active speaker with the other 2
      captures shown picture in picture within the stream can be
      provided

   o  A capture showing a zoomed out view of all 6 seats in the room can
      be provided

   The audio and video captures for this endpoint can be described as

   follows.  The Encode Group specifications can be found above in
   Section 6.3.4.1, Sample video encoding group specification #2.

   Video Captures:

   o  VC0- (the left camera stream), encoding group:EG0, attributes:
      purpose=main;auto-switched:no; area_of_capture={xBegin=0, xEnd=33}

   o  VC1- (the center camera stream), encoding group:EG1, attributes:
      purpose=main; auto-switched:no; area_of_capture={xBegin=33,
      xEnd=66}

   o  VC2- (the right camera stream), encoding group:EG2, attributes:
      purpose=main;auto-switched:no; area_of_capture={xBegin=66,
      xEnd=99}

   o  VC3- (the loudest panel stream), encoding group:EG1, attributes:
      purpose=main;auto-switched:yes; area_of_capture={xBegin=0,
      xEnd=99}

   o  VC4- (the loudest panel stream with PiPs), encoding group:EG1,
      attributes: purpose=main; composed=true; auto-switched:yes;
      area_of_capture={xBegin=0, xEnd=99}

   o  VC5- (the zoomed out view of all people in the room), encoding
      group:EG1, attributes: purpose=main;auto-switched:no;
      area_of_capture={xBegin=0, xEnd=99}

   o  VC6- (presentation stream), encoding group:EG1, attributes:
      purpose=presentation;auto-switched:no; area_of_capture={xBegin=0,
      xEnd=99}

   Summary of video captures - 3 codecs, center one is used for center
   camera stream, presentation stream, auto-switched, and zoomed views.

   Note the text in parentheses (e.g. "the left camera stream") is not
   explicitly part of the model, it is just explanatory text for this
   example, and is not included in the model with the media captures and
   attributes.

   [edt.  It is arbitrary that for this example the alternative views
   are on EG1 - they could have been spread out- it was not a necessary
   choice.]

   Audio Captures:

   o  AC0 (left), attributes: purpose=main;channel format=mono;
      area_of_capture={xBegin=0, xEnd=33}

   o  AC1 (right), attributes: purpose=main;channel format=mono;
      area_of_capture={xBegin=66, xEnd=99}

   o  AC2 (center) attributes: purpose=main;channel format=mono;
      area_of_capture={xBegin=33, xEnd=66}

   o  AC3 being a simple pre-mixed audio stream from the room (mono),
      attributes: purpose=main;channel format=mono; mixed=true;
      area_of_capture={xBegin=0, xEnd=99}

   o  AC4 audio stream associated with the presentation video (mono)
      attributes: purpose=presentation;channel format=mono;
      area_of_capture={xBegin=0, xEnd=99}

   The physical simultaneity information is:

      {VC0, VC1, VC2, VC3, VC4, VC6}

      {VC0, VC2, VC5, VC6}

   It is possible to select any or all of the rows in a capture set.
   This is strictly what is possible from the devices.  However, using
   every member in the set simultaneously may not make sense- for
   example VC3(loudest) and VC4 (loudest with PIP).  (In addition, there
   are encoding constraints that make choosing all of the VCs in a set
   impossible.  VC1, VC3, VC4, VC5, VC6 all use EG1 and EG1 has only 3
   ENCs.  This constraint shows up in the Capture list and encoding
   groups, not in the simultaneous transmission sets.)

   In this example there are no restrictions on which audio captures can
   be sent simultaneously.

   The following table represents the capture sets for this provider.
   Recall that a capture set is composed of alternative captures
   covering the same scene.  Capture Set #1 is for the main people
   captures, and Capture Set #2 is for presentation.

                            +----------------+
                            | Capture Set #1 |
                            +----------------+
                            | VC0, VC1, VC2  |

                            +----------------+

   Different capture sets are unique to each other, non-overlapping.  A
   consumer chooses a capture row from each capture set.  In this case
   the three captures VC0, VC1, and VC2 are one way of representing the
   video from the endpoint.  These three captures should appear adjacent
   next to each other.  Alternatively, another way of representing the
   Capture Scene is with the capture VC3, which automatically shows the
   person who is talking.  Similarly for the VC4 and VC5 alternatives.

   As in the video case, the different rows of audio in Capture Set #1
   represent the "same thing", in that one way to receive the audio is
   with the 3 linear position audio captures (AC0, AC1, AC2), and
   another way is with the single channel monaural format AC3.  The
   Media Consumer would choose the one audio capture row it is capable
   of receiving.

   The spatial ordering is understood by the media capture attributes
   area and point of capture.

   The consumer finds a "row" in each capture set #x section of the
   table that it wants.  It configures the streams according to the
   encoding group for the row.

   A Media Consumer would likely want to choose a row to receive based
   in part on how many streams it can simultaneously receive.  A
   consumer that can receive three people streams would probably prefer
   to receive the first row of Capture Set #1 (VC0, VC1, VC2) and not
   receive the other rows.  A consumer that can receive only one people
   stream would probably choose one of the other rows.

   If the consumer can receive a presentation stream too, it would also



Romanow, et al.           Expires April 5, 2012                [Page 26]

Internet-Draft         CLUE Telepresence Framework          October 2011


   choose to receive the only row from Capture Set #2 (VC6).

7.1.  The MCU Case

   This section shows how an MCU might express its Capture Sets,
   intending to offer different choices for consumers that can handle
   different numbers of streams.  A single audio capture stream is
   provided for all single and multi-screen configurations that can be
   associated (e.g. lip-synced) with any combination of video captures
   at the consumer.

   +--------------------+---------------------------------------------+
   | Capture Set #1     | note                                        |
   +--------------------+---------------------------------------------+
   | VC0                | video capture for single screen consumer    |
   | VC1, VC2           | video capture for 2 screen consumer         |
   | VC3, VC4, VC5      | video capture for 3 screen consumer         |
   | VC6, VC7, VC8, VC9 | video capture for 4 screen consumer         |
   | AC0                | audio capture representing all participants |
   +--------------------+---------------------------------------------+

   If / when a presentation stream becomes active within the conference,
   the MCU might re-advertise the available media as:

         +----------------+--------------------------------------+
         | Capture Set #2 | note                                 |
         +----------------+--------------------------------------+
         | VC10           | video capture for presentation       |
         | AC1            | presentation audio to accompany VC10 |
         +----------------+--------------------------------------+

7.2.  Media Consumer Behavior

   [Edt. Should this be moved to appendix?]

   The receive side of a call needs to balance its requirements, based
   on number of screens and speakers, its decoding capabilities and
   available bandwidth, and the provider's capabilities in order to
   optimally configure the provider's streams.  Typically it would want
   to receive and decode media from each capture set advertised by the
   provider.

   A sane, basic, algorithm might be for the consumer to go through each
   capture set in turn and find the collection of video captures that
   best matches the number of screens it has (this might include
   consideration of screens dedicated to presentation video display
   rather than "people" video) and then decide between alternative rows
   in the video capture sets based either on hard-coded preferences or



Romanow, et al.           Expires April 5, 2012                [Page 27]

Internet-Draft         CLUE Telepresence Framework          October 2011


   user choice.  Once this choice has been made, the consumer would then
   decide how to configure the provider's encode groups in order to make
   best use of the available network bandwidth and its own decoding
   capabilities.

7.2.1.  One screen consumer

   VC3, VC4 and VC5 are all on different rows by themselves, not in a
   group, so the receiving device should choose between one of those.
   The choice would come down to whether to see the greatest number of
   participants simultaneously at roughly equal precedence (VC5), a
   switched view of just the loudest region (VC3) or a switched view
   with PiPs (VC4).  An endpoint device with a small amount of knowledge
   of these differences could offer a dynamic choice of these options,
   in-call, to the user.

7.2.2.  Two screen consumer configuring the example

   Mixing systems with an even number of screens, "2n", and those with
   "2n+1" cameras (and vice versa) is always likely to be the
   problematic case.  In this instance, the behavior is likely to be
   determined by whether a "2 screen" system is really a "2 decoder"
   system, i.e., whether only one received stream can be displayed per
   screen or whether more than 2 streams can be received and spread
   across the available screen area.  To enumerate 3 possible behaviors
   here for the 2 screen system when it learns that the far end is
   "ideally" expressed via 3 capture streams:

   v

   1.  Fall back to receiving just a single stream (VC3, VC4 or VC5 as
       per the 1 screen consumer case above) and either leave one screen
       blank or use it for presentation if / when a presentation becomes
       active

   2.  Receive 3 streams (VC0, VC1 and VC2) and display across 2 screens
       (either with each capture being scaled to 2/3 of a screen and the
       centre capture being split across 2 screens) or, as would be
       necessary if there were large bezels on the screens, with each
       stream being scaled to 1/2 the screen width and height and there
       being a 4th "blank" panel.  This 4th panel could potentially be
       used for any presentation that became active during the call.

   3.  Receive 3 streams, decode all 3, and use control information
       indicating which was the most active to switch between showing
       the left and centre streams (one per screen) and the centre and
       right streams.

Internet-Draft         CLUE Telepresence Framework          October 2011


   For an endpoint capable of all 3 methods of working described above,
   again it might be appropriate to offer the user the choice of display
   mode.

7.2.3.  Three screen consumer configuring the example

   This is the most straightforward case - the consumer would look to
   identify a set of streams to receive that best matched its available
   screens and so the VC0 plus VC1 plus VC2 should match optimally.  The
   spatial ordering would give sufficient information for the correct
   video capture to be shown on the correct screen, and the consumer
   would either need to divide a single encode group's capability by 3
   to determine what resolution and frame rate to configure the provider
   with or to configure the individual video captures' encode groups
   with what makes most sense (taking into account the receive side
   decode capabilities, overall call bandwidth, the resolution of the
   screens plus any user preferences such as motion vs sharpness).

Appendix A.  Open Issues

A.1.  Video layout arrangements and centralized composition

   In the context of a conference with a central MCU, there has been
   discussion about a consumer requesting the provider to provide a
   certain type of layout arrangement or perform a certain composition
   algorithm, such as combining some number of most recent talkers, or
   producing a video layout using a 2x2 grid or 1 large cell with 5
   smaller cells around it.  The current framework does not address
   this.  It isn't clear if this topic should be included in this
   framework, or maybe a different part of CLUE, or maybe outside of
   CLUE altogether.

A.2.  Source is selectable

   A Boolean variable.  True indicates the media consumer can request a
   particular media source be mapped to a media capture.  Default is
   false.

   TBD - how does the consumer make the request for a particular source?
   How does the consumer know what is available?  Need to explain better
   how multiple media captures are different from a single media capture
   with choices for the source, and when each concept should be used.

A.3.  Media Source Selection

   The use cases include a case where the person at a receiving endpoint
   can request to receive media from a particular other endpoint, for
   example in a multipoint call to request to receive the video from a
   certain section of a certain room, whether or not people there are
   talking.

   TBD - this framework should address this case.  Maybe need a roster
   list of rooms or people in the conference, with a mechanism to select
   from the roster and associate it with media captures.  This is
   different from selecting a particular media capture from a capture
   set.  The mechanism to do this will probably need to be different
   than selecting media captures based on capture sets and attributes.

Internet-Draft         CLUE Telepresence Framework          October 2011


A.4.  Endpoint requesting many streams from MCU

   TBD - how to do VC selection for a system where the endpoint media
   consumers want to receive lots of streams and do their own
   composition, rather than MCU doing transcoding and composing.
   Example is 3 screen consumer that wants 3 large loudest speaker
   streams, and a bunch of small ones to render as PiP.  How the small
   ones are chosen, which could potentially be chosen by either the
   endpoint or MCU.  There are other more complicated examples also.  Is
   the current framework adequate to support this?

A.5.  VAD (voice activity detection) tagging of audio streams

   TBD - do we want to have VAD be mandatory?  All audio streams
   originating from a media provider must be tagged with VAD
   information.  This tagging would include an overall energy value for
   the stream plus information on which sections of the capture scene
   are "active".

   Each audio stream which forms a constituent of a row within a capture
   set should include this tagging, and the energy value within it
   calculated using a fixed, consistent algorithm.

   When a system determines the most active area of a capture scene
   (either "loudest", or determined by other means such as a button
   press) it should convey that information to the corresponding media
   stream consumer via any audio streams being sent within that capture
   set.  Specifically, there should be a list of active linear positions
   and their VAD characteristics within the audio stream in addition to
   the overall VAD information for the capture set.  This is to ensure
   all media stream consumers receive the same, consistent, audio energy
   information whichever audio capture or captures they choose to
   receive for a capture set.  Additionally, linear position information
   can be mapped to video captures by a media stream consumer in order
   that it can perform "panel switching" if required.
