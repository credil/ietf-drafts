Extensions to the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
                    for Associated Bidirectional LSP
             draft-he-pce-pcep-associated-lsp-extensions-01

Abstract

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) requirements document[RFC5654],
   describes that MPLS-TP MUST support associated bidirectional point-
   to-point LSPs.  Path Computation Element (PCE), see [RFC4655], may be
   used for path computation of an associated bidirectional LSP.  This
   document defines the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP)-based
   [RFC5440] extensions for associated bidirectional LSP.

Internet-Draft  PCEP Ext for Associated Bidirectional Lsp  November 2011


1.  Introduction

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) requirements [RFC5654] and
   control plane framework documents[RFC6373]describe that MPLS-TP MUST
   support associated bidirectional point-to-point LSPs.  Path
   Computation Element (PCE), see [RFC4655], may be used for path
   computation of a GMPLS LSP, see
   [I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-pcep-extensions],and consequently an associated
   bidirectional LSP, across domains and in a single domain.

   Dependent path computations are requests that need to be synchronized
   in order to meet specific objectives, see [RFC6007].  For associated
   bidirectional LSP, if the forward LSP and the backward LSP are
   computed concurrently, the PCE can find the optimum path.

   This document defines the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP)-
   based [RFC5440] extensions for associated bidirectional LSP.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Processing

   Consider the topology described in Figure 1.  (An example of
   associated bidirectional LSP).  The LSP1 [via nodes A,D,B] (from A to
   B) and LSP2 [via nodes B,D,C,A] (from B to A) need to be established,
   which can form an associated bidirectional LSP deployed by Single
   Sided Provisioning model or Double Sided Provisioning
   model[I-D.ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-rsvpte-ext-associated-lsp].  Node A, the
   ingress LSR of LSP1, can play the role of a PCC and request the PCE
   to compute the LSP1 or the associated bidirectional LSP.

   by the concurrent or successive computation.  The concurrent
   computation means that the head-end submits the computation request
   for both two directional LSPs concurrently, which is applicable to
   the Single Sided Provisioning model.  As to the successive
   computation, the head-end and the tail-end send the forward LSP and
   backward LSP computation requests separately, which is applicable to
   both the Single Sided Provisioning model and the Double Sided
   Provisioning model.

3.1.  Concurrent Computation

   The PCC sends the PCReq message to PCE for computing an associated
   bidirectional LSP, whose forward and backward paths are computed
   concurrently.  Concurrent computation can ensure that the paths for
   the associated bidirectional LSP is optimal [RFC5557].

   The SVEC object described in [RFC6007] can be used to synchronize the
   requests about the forward and backward LSPs, and get the optimal
   path for the associated bidirectional LSP.

3.2.  Successive Computation

   For the Successive computation, the PCCs submit the path computation
   request for the forward LSP and the backward LSP separately, then,
   the path for the associated bidirectional LSP may be not optimal.  So
   that the two reverse LSPs should be associated, the ASSOCIATION
   object [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-ext]may be useful.  The stateful PCE
   [RFC4655] can coordinate the two reverse LSPs to get the optimal path
   for the associated bidirectional LSP through the ASSOCIATION object,
   if both the head-end and the tail-end PCCs delegate their respective
   LSPs (forward and backward) to the PCE .

   When the PCC submits the path computation request for the forward LSP
   or the backward LSP, the PCReq message may carry Extended ASSOCIATION
   object to indicate there is a reverse LSP to be associated, see
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-rsvpte-ext-associated-lsp].  At the same
   time, both the head-end and the tail-end PCCs delegate their
   respective LSPs (forward and backward) to the PCE using PCRpt
   messages[I-D.crabbe-pce-stateful-pce].

   Upon receipt of the PCReq message,the PCE will locate the reverse LSP
   with the same association information.  If there is no matched
   reverse LSP, the PCE will compute the LSP independently.  Otherwise,
   the PCE will coordinate the two reverse LSPs and compute path for the
   associated bidirectional LSP.  After the successful computation, the
   PCE will trigger the head-end to setup the forward LSP and the tail-
   end to setup the backward LSP using PCUpd messages.  The PCC will use
   make-before-break whenever possible in the re-signaling

4.  PCEP Extensions

4.1.  Extended ASSOCIATION Object

   The Extended ASSOCIATION Object is used to associate the two reverse
   LSPs, which form an associated bidirectional LSP.  The Extended
   ASSOCIATION Object is carried within a PCRep message to locate the
   reverse LSP, and the PCE will coordinate the forward LSP and the
   backward LSP to get the optimal path for the associated bidirectional
   LSP.

   The contents of this object are identical in encoding to the contents
   of the RSVP-TE Extended ASSOCIATION Object defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-assoc-ext] and
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-mpls-tp-rsvpte-ext-associated-lsp].

   PCEP Extended ASSOCIATION object types correspond to RSVP-TE Extended
   ASSOCIATION object types.

   Extended ASSOCIATION Object-Class is TBD.

   Extended ASSOCIATION Object-Type is TBD.
