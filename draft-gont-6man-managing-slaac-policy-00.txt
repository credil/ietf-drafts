                draft-gont-6man-managing-slaac-policy-00

Abstract

   This document describes an operational problem that arises due to the
   impossibility of managing the address generation policy employed by
   hosts participating in IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
   (SLAAC).  Additionally, it specifies a new field in the Prefix
   Information option of Router Advertisement messages, such that
   routers can advertise, for each network prefix included in a Router
   Advertisement message, the desired address generation policy to be
   used for SLAAC.

Internet-Draft   Managing the Address Generation Policy    December 2011


1.  Introduction

   [RFC4862] specifies the Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
   for IPv6, which typically results in hosts configuring one or more
   addresses composed of a network prefix advertised by a local router,
   and an Interface Identifier (IID) that typically embeds a hardware
   address (using the Modified EUI-64 Format [RFC4291].

   Since the identifiers (e.g.  Ethernet MAC addresses) typically used
   for those addresses are usually globally unique, the IPv6 addresses
   generated as specified in [RFC4291] can be leveraged to track and
   correlate the activity of a node, thus negatively affecting the
   privacy of users.

   The "Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in
   IPv6" [RFC4941] were introduced to difficult the task of
   eavesdroppers and other information collectors to correlate the
   activities of a node, and basically result in random Interface
   Identifiers that are typically more difficult to leverage than their
   Modified EUI-64 Format counterpart.  Some flavor of these "Privacy
   Extensions" have been implemented in a variety of systems, some of
   which (notably Microsoft Windows Vista and Microsoft Windows 7)
   enable them by default.

   The impossibility of managing the address generation policy employed
   for SLAAC poses a problem when a site desires or requires a specific
   policy for the generation of IPv6 addresses.  For example, some
   operating systems (notably FreeBSD) implement "Privacy Extensions",
   but do not enable them by default.  And since there is currently no
   mechanism in IPv6 to convey the desired address-generation policy,
   administrators have no option other than manual configuration to
   enable such extensions.  On the other hand, some implementations
   (notably Windows Vista and Windows 7) that enable "Privacy
   Extensions" by default might need to be deployed on sites that
   require the use of stable addresses (e.g. those resulting from
   Modified EUI-64 Format Identifiers [RFC4291]), for the ease of
   correlating network activities or enforcing simple access controls.
   However, since there is currently no mechanism to convey the desired
   address-generation policy for SLAAC, an administrator would need to
   manually-configure each of the attached nodes such that they employ
   the desired address generation policy.

   Depending on manual configuration for enabling a specific and
   homogeneous address-generation policy may result in a lot of work on
   the side of the administrator, but may also be difficult to
   implement, particularly when considering mobile nodes such as laptops
   and mobile phones [Broersma].  Additionally, the lack of a mechanism
   for conveying address-generation policy information might preclude

   the use of some technologies, such as "Privacy Extensions" [RFC4941],
   which are desirable in most general environments (e.g., a typical
   home network, or an Internet cafe), but are currently only enabled as
   a result of manual configuration.

   This document specifies a new field in the Prefix Information option
   of Router Advertisement messages, such that routers can advertise,
   for each network prefix to be used for SLAAC, the desired policy for
   the generation of IPv6 addresses.  The policy information is simply
   "advisory" information, in the sense that hosts still have the final
   word on which address generation policy they use.

   The aforementioned policy information basically indicates whether
   "stable" or "temporary" addresses are desired.  We note that while
   the only address generation policies that have so far been
   standardized by the IETF are those based on e.g.  IEEE identifiers
   and "Privacy Extensions for SLAAC", other address generation policies
   are possible.  For example, [STABLE-PRIV] describes an address
   generation policy which results in interface identifiers that are
   stable for each prefix used for SLAAC, but that change from one
   autoconfiguration prefix to another.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Updating the Prefix Information option

   The syntax of the Prefix Information option is updated as follows:


      0                   1                   2                   3

     |                                                               |
     +                                                               +
     |                                                               |
     +                            Prefix                             +
     |                                                               |
     +                                                               +
     |                                                               |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   An additional field, the two-bit "AGP" (Address Generation Policy)
   field, is specified for the Prefix Information option.  The semantics
   of each of the possible values are:

   00:
      No specific advice is provided for the generation of addresses for
      this prefix.

   01:
      When generating addresses for this prefix, the resulting addresses
      SHOULD be stable (i.e., not temporary).  The resulting stable
      addresses may be based on Modified EUI-64 Format Identifiers
      [RFC4291], the stable private identifiers proposed in
      [STABLE-PRIV], or any other address generation policy specified in
      the future which results in IPv6 addresses that are stable/
      constant for that autoconfiguration prefix/subnet.

   10:
      When generating addresses for this prefix, temporary addresses
      SHOULD be employed.  The resulting addresses may be based on
      "Privacy Extensions for SLAAC" [RFC4941], or on any other policy
      which results in temporary Interface Identifiers.  Address
      generation policies that result in stable addresses (such as those

      specified in [RFC4941] and [STABLE-PRIV]) SHOULD NOT be used for
      this prefix.

   11:
      Unused (reserved for future use).  The special value "11" is
      reserved for future extensions, and MUST NOT be set by routers
      implementing this specification.  Hosts that implement this
      specification MUST interpret the special value "11" in the same
      way as "00" (i.e., no specific advice is provided for address
      generation).

      Note: The "R" bit was specified by [RFC3775].  The Rsvd1 field
      corresponds to the remaining reserved bits, and thus MUST be set
      to zero by the sender of this option, and ignored by the receiver.

   Since the "AGP" bits correspond to a previously "reserved" field,
   implementations that predate this specification should be setting the
   AGP field to "00" when sending the option, and ignoring the AGP bits
   upon receipt.

3.  Router specification

3.1.  Router configuration

   This section specifies a variable that routers implementing this
   specification MUST support:

   DesiredAddressPolicy:
      This variable specifies the desired address generation policy for
      IPv6 addresses resulting from SLAAC.  As of this specification,
      possible values are: "Default", "TemporaryAddresses", and
      "StableAddresses".  This variable SHOULD default to "Default".

3.2.  Router operation

   A router sending a Prefix Information option MUST set the AGP bits
   according to the value of the variable DesiredAddressPolicy.  The
   following table specifies which values must be used for the AGP field
   depending on the value of the DesiredAddressPolicy variable.

                   +----------------------+-----------+
                   | DesiredAddressPolicy | AGP field |
                   +----------------------+-----------+
                   |        Default       |     00    |
                   +----------------------+-----------+
                   |    StableAddresses   |     01    |
                   +----------------------+-----------+
                   |  TemporaryAddresses  |     10    |
                   +----------------------+-----------+

4.  Host specification

4.1.  Host configuration

   This section specifies two new variables that hosts implementing this
   specification MUST support:

   AddressPolicyConfiguration:
      This variable specifies whether the host should honor the advice
      conveyed in the AGP field of the received Prefix Information
      options.  There are two possible values for this variable:
      "Enabled" and "Disabled".  This variable SHOULD default to
      "Enabled".

   DefaultAddressPolicy:
      This variable specifies the default IPv6 address generation policy
      that will be employed if AddressPolicyConfiguration is set to
      "Disabled", or if "AddressPolicyConfiguration" is set to "Enabled"
      but the AGP field of the received Prefix Information option is set
      to "00" (i.e., no specific advice is provided for the generation
      of addresses for this prefix).  As of this specification, possible
      values are "TemporaryAddresses" (e.g. for [RFC4941]) and
      "StableAddresses" (for [RFC4291] or [STABLE-PRIV]).  This variable
      SHOULD default to "TemporaryAddresses".

   A host willing to ignore the advice of the router regarding which
   policy to use to generate IPv6 addresses MAY do so by setting
   AddressPolicyConfiguration to "Disabled".

   It should be noted that the aforementioned variables might have
   different granularities.  For example, a host could specify a set of
   EnableAddressPolicy and DefaultAddressPolicy variables on a global
   basis, on a "per network interface type" basis, on a "per wireless
   network" basis, etc.

4.2.  Host Operation

   When generating addresses for the prefix contained in a "Prefix
   Information Option", hosts implementing this specification MUST
   proceed as follows:

   o  If AddressPolicyConfiguration is set to "Enabled", the host SHOULD
      employ only the policy specified by the AGP field when generating
      addresses for this prefix.  If no specific advice is provided
      (i.e., the AGP field is set to "00"), the host SHOULD employ only
      the policy specified by the DefaultAddressPolicy variable when
      generating addresses for this prefix.

   o  If AddressPolicyConfiguration is Disabled, the host SHOULD employ
      only the policy specified by the DefaultAddressPolicy variable
      when generating addresses for this prefix.

6.  Privacy Considerations

   As discussed in [RFC4941], IPv6 addresses generated using the
   Modified EUI-64 Format Identifiers [RFC4291] allow tracking of nodes
   across networks, since the resulting Interface-ID is a globally-
   unique value that will remain constant across all networks that the
   node may connect to.

   As specified in Section 3 and Section 4 of this document, the default
   value for the AGP bits of a Prefix Information option is "01" (no
   specific advice is provided for the generation of addresses for this
   prefix), and the default address generation policy
   (DefaultAddressPolicy) for hosts is set to "TemporaryAddresses".
   This means that, unless the router or host default settings are
   overridden, the default settings resulting from this specification
   will enable the use of "temporary addresses" (such as those specified
   in [RFC4941]).

   Nevertheless, it should be noted that the mechanism specified in this
   document simply provides the means for a router to convey *advisory*
   information regarding the desired policy for generating IPv6
   addresses when SLAAC is employed: this specification allows hosts to
   ignore the aforementioned advice when deemed appropriate (by setting
   AddressPolicyConfiguration to "Disabled").  For example, hosts very
   concerned with the privacy implications of using interface
   identifiers that remain constant across networks may set
   AddressPolicyConfiguration to "Disabled" and DefaultAddressPolicy to
   "TemporaryAddresses" when connecting to untrusted networks, such that
   Temporary Addresses (such as those specified in [RFC4941]) are always
   employed (despite the advice provided by the local router).

   Finally, we note that the value and effectiveness of some variants of
   Temporary Addresses (such as that specified in [RFC4941]) have been
   questioned in a number of studies [I-D.dupont-ipv6-rfc3041harmful]
   [Escudero] [CPNI-IPv6].  However, this document does not take a
   stance about their value and effectiveness.

7.  Security Considerations

   An attacker could exploit the mechanism specified in this document to
   cause hosts in a given subnet to disable "Temporary Addresses", thus
   usually leading to the generation of Interface Identifiers that embed
   the underlying hardware address (e.g. using Modified EUI-64 Format
   Identifiers), instead.  Thus, in such cases, the privacy of the
   victim hosts that would have enabled the Privacy Extensions could
   possibly be reduced.

   However, some considerations should be made about such possible
   attack.  Firstly, such an attack would require from an attacker the
   same effort as any other Neighbor Discovery attack based on crafted
   Router Advertisement messages [RFC3756] [CPNI-IPv6], most of which
   would be far more interesting for an attacker than this possible
   attack vector.  For example, a (possibly malicious) router could
   still cause a host to use Modified EUI-64 Format Identifiers if
   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] is required for address configuration, and the
   DHCPv6 server selects the IPv6 addresses to be leased to hosts based
   on e.g. the source link-layer address of the DHCP requests.
   Secondly, while the the only policy for generating stable IPv6
   addresses that has so far been standardized by the IETF is that based
   on e.g.  IEEE identifiers, there are other possible policies, such as
   that proposed in [STABLE-PRIV], that lead to stable addresses.  That
   is, use of "stable" identifiers does not necessarily imply that such
   identifiers remain stable/constant across networks.

   In those cases in which the network itself is trusted, but users
   connected to the same network are not, the possible options for
   mitigating this and other attack vectors based on crafted Router
   Advertisement messages include the deployment of the so-called
   "Router Advertisement guard" mechanism [RFC6104], with the
   implementation guidelines described in
   [I-D.gont-v6ops-ra-guard-evasion].  Additionally, SEND (SEcure
   Neighbor Discovery) [RFC3971] could be potentially deployed to
   mitigate these and other Neighbor Discovery attacks.  However, a
   number of issues (such as the requirement for Public Key
   Infrastructure) difficult the deployment of SEND in most general
   network scenarios [CPNI-IPv6].

Appendix A.  Changes from previous versions of the document (to be
             removed by the RFC Editor before publication of this
             document as a RFC

A.1.  Changes from draft-gont-6man-managing-privacy-extensions-01

   o  The address-generation policy information has been changed from
      "'Modified EUI-64' vs. 'Privacy Addresses'" to "'stable addresses'
      vs. 'temporary addresses'", thus noting that more than one
      possible policy exists for each category.

   o  The appendix on possible alternative specifications for the AGP
      bits has been removed.

   o  The document now focuses on a mechanism that would enable
      increased use of "temporary addresses" (such as "Privacy
      Extensions").
