     Security Extension for OSPFv2 when using Manual Key Management
          draft-ietf-ospf-security-extension-manual-keying-01

Abstract

   The current OSPFv2 cryptographic authentication mechanism as defined
   in the OSPF standards is vulnerable to both inter-session and intra-
   session replay attacks when its uses manual keying.  Additionally,
   the existing cryptographic authentication schemes do not cover the IP
   header.  This omission can be exploited to carry out various types of
   attacks.

   This draft proposes changes to the authentication sequence number
   mechanism that will protect OSPFv2 from both inter-session and intra-
   session replay attacks when its using manual keys for securing its
   protocol packets.  Additionally, we also describe some changes in the
   cryptographic hash computation so that we eliminate most attacks that
   result because OSPFv2 does not protect the IP header.

1.  Introduction

   The OSPFv2 cryptographic authentication mechanism as described in
   [[RFC2328]] uses per-packet sequence numbers to provide protection
   against replay attacks.  The sequence numbers increase monotonically
   so that the attempts to replay the stale packets can be thwarted.
   The sequence number values are maintained as a part of adjacency
   states.  Therefore, if an adjacency is broken down, the associated
   sequence numbers get reinitialized and the neighbors start all over
   again.  Additionally, the cryptographic authentication mechanism does
   not specify how to deal with the rollover of a sequence number when
   its value would wrap.  These omissions can be taken advantage of by
   attackers to implement various replay attacks ([RFC6039]).  In order
   to address these issues, we propose extensions to the authentication
   sequence number mechanism.  Compared with the cryptographic
   authentication mechanism proposed in [RFC5709], the solution proposed
   does not impose any more security presumption.

   The cryptographic authentication as described in [RFC2328] and later
   updated in [RFC5709] does not include the IP header.  This also can
   be exploited to launch several attacks as the source address in the
   IP header is no longer protected.  The OSPF specification, for
   broadcast and NBMA (Non-Broadcast Multi-Access Networks), requires
   the implementations to look at the source address in the IP header to
   determine the neighbor from witch the packet was received.  Changing
   the IP source address of a packet which can confuse the receiver and
   can be exploited to produce a number of denial of service attacks
   [RFC6039].  If the packet is interpreted as coming from a different
   neighbor, the sequence number received from the neighbor may be
   updated.  This may disrupt communication with the legitimate
   neighbor.  Hello packets may be reflected to cause a neighbor to
   appear to have one-way communication.  Old Database descriptions may
   be reflected in cases where the per-packet sequence numbers are
   sufficiently divergent in order to disrupt an adjacency
   [I-D.ietf-karp-ospf-analysis].  This is referred to as the IP layer
   issue in [I-D.ietf-karp-threats-reqs].

   [RFC2328] states that implementations MUST offer keyed MD5
   authentication.  It is likely that this will be deprecated in favor
   of the stronger algorithms described in [RFC5709] in future
   deployments [I-D.ietf-opsec-igp-crypto-requirements].

   This draft proposes a simple change in the cryptographic
   authentication mechanism, as currently described in [RFC5709], to
   prevent such IP layer attacks.

1.1.  Requirements Section

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

   When used in lowercase, these words convey their typical use in
   common language, and are not to be interpreted as described in
   RFC2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Replay Protection using Extended Sequence Numbers

   In order to provide replay protection against both inter-session and
   intra-session replay attacks, the OSPFv2 sequence number is expanded
   to 64-bits with the least significant 32-bit value containing a
   strictly increasing sequence number and the most significant 32-bit
   value containing the boot count.  OSPFv2 implementations are required
   to retain the boot count in non-volatile storage for the deployment
   life the OSPF router.  The requirement to preserve the boot count is
   also placed on SNMP agents by the SNMPv3 security architecture (refer
   to snmpEngineBoots in [RFC4222].

   Since there is no room in the OSPFv2 packet for a 64-bit sequence
   number, it will occupy the 8 octets following the OSPFv2 packet and
   MUST be included when calculating the OSPFv2 packet digest.  These
   additional 8 bytes are not included in the OSPFv2 packet header
   length but are included in the OSPFv2 header Authentication Data
   length and the IPv4 packet header length.

   The lower order 32-bit sequence number MUST be incremented for every
   OSPF packet sent by the OSPF router.  Upon reception, the sequence
   number MUST be greater than the sequence number in the last OSPF
   packet of that type accepted from the sending OSPF neighbor.
   Otherwise, the OSPF packet is considered a replayed packet and
   dropped.  OSPF packets of different types may arrive out of order if
   they are priorized as recommended in [RFC3414].

   OSPF routers implementing this specification MUST use available
   mechanisms to preserve the sequence number's strictly increasing
   property for the deployed life of the OSPFv3 router (including cold
   restarts).  This is achieved by maintaining a boot count in non-
   volatile storage and incrementing it each time the OSPF router loses
   its prior sequence number state.  The SNMPv3 snmpEngineBoots variable
   [RFC4222] MAY be used for this purpose.  However, maintaining a
   separate boot count solely for OSPF sequence numbers has the
   advantage of decoupling SNMP reinitialization and OSPF
   reinitialization.  Also, in the rare event that the lower order 32-

   bit sequence number wraps, the boot count can be incremented to
   preserve the strictly increasing property of the aggregate sequence
   number.  Hence, a separate OSPF boot count is RECOMMENDED.


3.  OSPF Packet Extensions

   The OSPF packet header includes an authentication type field, and 64-
   bits of data for use by the appropriate authentication scheme
   (determined by the type field).  Authentication types 0, 1 and 2 are
   defined [RFC2328].  This section of this defines Authentication type
   TBD (3 is recommended).

   When using this authentication scheme, the 64-bit Authentication
   field in the OSPF packet header as defined in section D.3 of
   [RFC2328] is changed as shown below.  The sequence number is removed
   and the Key ID is extended to 32 bits and moved to the former
   position of the sequence number.

   Additionally, the 64-bit sequence number is moved to the first 64-
   bits following the OSPFv2 packet and is protected by the
   authentication digest.  These additional 64 bits or 8 octets are
   included in the IP header length but not the OSPF header packet
   length.

4.  OSPF Packet Key Selection

   This section describes how the proposed security solution selects
   long-lived keys from key tables.  [I-D.ietf-karp-crypto-key-table].
   Generally, a key used for OSPFv2 packet authentication should satisfy
   the following requirements:

   o  The key time period as defined by NotBefore and NotAfter must
      include the current time.

   o  The key can be used for the desired security algorithm.

   In the remainder of this section, additional requirements for keys
   are enumerated for different scenarios.

Internet-Draft         OSPF Manual Key Management           October 2011


4.1.  Key Selection for Unicast OSPF Packet Transmission

   Assume that a router R1 tries to send a unicast OSPF packet from its
   interface I1 to the interface R2 of a remote router R2 using security
   protocol P via interface I at time T. Firstly consider the
   circumstances where R1 and R2 are not connected with a virtual link.
   R1 then needs to select a long long-lived symmetric key from its key
   table.  Because the key should be shared by the by both R1 and R2 to
   protect the communication between I1 and I2, the key should satisfy
   the following requirements:

   o  The Peer field includes the router ID of R2.

   o  the PeerKeyID field is not "unknown".

   o  The Interfaces field includes I1.

   o  the Direction field is either "out" or "both".

   When R1 and R2 are connected to a virtual link, the third condition
   is a little more complex.  Because the virtual link can be regarded
   as an unnumbered point-to-point network, the IP address of the
   interface actually used to send the packet (i.e., I1) is discovered
   during routing table calculation.  Therefore, when the system
   operator configures keys to protect the virtual link, I1 is unknown
   and can be any OSPF interface in the OSPF virtual link's transit
   area.  Therefore, the key should be identified solely by the local
   and remote router IDs rather than by the interface on which the
   packet is sent.  The third requirement list above should be changed
   to "the Interface field includes the router ID".

4.2.  Key Selection for Multicast OSPF Packet Transmission

   If a router R1 sends an OSPF packet from its interface I1 to a
   multicast address (e.g., AllSPFRouters, AllDRouters), it needs to
   select a key according to the following requirements:

   o  The Peer field includes the multicast address.

   o  The PeerKeyID field is "group".

   o  The Interfaces field includes I1.

   o  The Direction field is either "out" or "both".

Internet-Draft         OSPF Manual Key Management           October 2011


4.3.  Key Selection for OSPF Packet Reception

   When Cryptographic Authentication is employed, the ID of the
   authentication key is included in the authentication field of the
   OSPF packet header.  Using this key ID, it is relatively easy for a
   receiver to locate the key.  The simple requirements are:

   o  The Peer field includes the router ID of the sender.

   o  The PeerKeyID field includes the key ID obtained from the
      authentication field.

   o  The Direction field is either "in" or "both".


5.  Mechanism to secure the IP header

   This document updates the definition of Apad which is currently a
   constant defined in [RFC5709] to the source address from the IP
   header of the OSPFv2 protocol packet.  The overall cryptographic
   authentication process defined in [RFC5709] remains unchanged.  To
   reduce the potential for confusion, this section minimizes the
   repetition of text from RFC 5709 and is incorporated here by
   reference [RFC5709].

   RFC 5709, Section 3.3, describes how the cryptographic authentication
   must be computed.  It requires OSPFv2 packet's Authentication Trailer
   (which is the appendage described in RFC 2328, Section D.4.3, Page
   233, items (6)(a) and (6)(d)) to be filled with the value Apad where
   Apad is a hexadecimal constant value 0x878FE1F3 repeated (L/4) times,
   where L is the length of the hash being used and is measured in
   octets rather than bits.

   Routers at the sending side must initialize Apad to a value of the
   source address that would be used when sending out the OSPFv2 packet,
   repeated L/4 times, where L is the length of the hash, measured in
   octets.  The basic idea is to incorporate the source address from the
   IP header in the cryptographic authentication computation so that any
   change of IP source address in a replayed packet can be detected.

   At the receiving end, implementations MUST initialize Apad as the
   source address from IP Header of the incoming OSPFv2 packet, repeated
   L/4 times, instead of the constant that's currently defined in
   [RFC5709].  Besides changing the value of Apad, this document does
   not introduce any other changes to the authentication mechanism
   described in [RFC5709].  This would prevent all attacks where a rogue
   OSPF router changes the IP source address of an OSPFv2 packet and
   replays it on the same multi-access interface or another interface

Internet-Draft         OSPF Manual Key Management           October 2011


   since the IP source address is now protected and such changes would
   cause the authentication check to fail and the replayed packet to be
   rejected.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document attempts to fix the manual key management procedure
   that currently exists within OSPFv2, as part of the Phase 1 of the
   KARP Working Group.  Therefore, only the OSPFv2 manual key management
   mechanism is considered.  Any solution that takes advantage of the
   automatic key management mechanism is beyond the scope of this
   document.

   The proposed sequence number extension offers most of the benefits of
   of more complicated mechanisms involving challenges.  There are,
   however, a couple drawbacks to this approach.  First, it requires the
   OSPF implementation to be able to save its boot count in non-volatile
   storage.  If the non-volatile storage is ever repaired or upgraded
   such that the contents are lost or the OSPFv2 router is replaced with
   a model, the keys MUST be changed to prevent replay attacks.

   Second, if a router is taken out of service completely (either
   intentionally or due to a persistent failure), the potential exists
   for reestablishment of an OSPFv2 adjacency by replaying the entire
   OSPFv2 session establishment.  This scenario is however, extremely
   unlikely, since it would imply an identical OSPFv2 adjacency
   formation packet exchange.  The replay of OSPFv2 hello packets alone
   for an OSPFv2 router that has been taken out of service should not
   result in any serious attack as the only consequence is superfluous
   processing.  Of course, this attack could also be thwarted by
   changing the relevant manual keys.

   This document also provides a solution to prevent certain denial of
   service attacks that can be launched by changing the source address
   in the IP header of the OSPFv2 protocol packet.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests a new code point from the "OSPF Shortest Path
   First (OSPF) Authentication Codes" registry:

   o  TBD - Cryptographic Authentication with Extended Sequence Numbers.
      The value 3 is recommended.
