    <note title="Author's Note">
      <t>
        This draft is heavily influenced by the original JSON 
        Activity Streams 1.0 specification that was originally co-authored 
        by Martin Atkins, Will Norris, Chris Messina, Monica Wilkinson, 
        Rob Dolin and James Snell. The author is very thankful for their 
        significant contributions and gladly stands on their shoulders.
        Some portions of the original text of Activity Streams 1.0 are
        used in this document.
      </t>
      <t>
        The Activity Streams 1.0 and 2.0 specifications are works produced 
        by the Activity Streams Working Group (http://activitystrea.ms/) 
        operating independently of the IETF. Discussion and feedback about 
        this specification is invited and should be directed to the Activity 
        Streams Mailing List (see  
        https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/activity-streams).

      <t>
        In the most basic sense, an "activity" is a semantic description
        of either a potential or completed action. In the former case, 
        activities express what can be done with any particular object, 
        while in the latter case, they express what has already been 
        done.
      </t>

      <t>
        It is the goal of this specification to provide a JSON-based syntax
        that is sufficient to express metadata about activities in a rich,
        human-friendly, machine-processable and extensible manner. This may
        include constructing natural-language descriptions or visual 
        representations about the activity, associating actionable 
        information with various types of objects, communicating or recording 
        activity logs, or delegation of potential actions to other applications.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in 
        <xref target="RFC2119" />.
      </t>
      
      <section title="Relationship to JSON Activity Streams 1.0" anchor="asms-1">
        
        <t>
          The <xref target="activitystreams-1.0">JSON Activity 
          Streams 1.0</xref> specification was published in May
          of 2011 and provided a baseline extensible syntax for the expression
          of completed activities. This specification builds upon that 
          initial foundation by incorporating lessons learned through 
          extensive implementation, community feedback and related work 
          being performed in other standards development communities.
        </t>
        
        <t>
          While the syntax defined by this specification diverges somewhat 
          from that defined by JSON Activity Streams 1.0, the verbs, objectTypes,
          extensions and fundamental model defined by that original 
          specification remain intact.
        </t>
        
      </section>

      <section title="Relationship to JSON-LD 1.0" anchor="json-ld" >
        
        <t>
          The <xref target="W3C.WD-json-ld-20130411">JSON-based Serialization for 
          Linked Data (JSON-LD)</xref> describes a rich syntax for the 
          serialization of semantically-rich metadata using the JSON format. 
          While the updated Activity Streams representation provided by this 
          document is not defined as a "JSON-LD Vocabulary", the syntax is 
          designed to be closely compatible with JSON-LD.
        </t>
        
        <t>
          There are a few differences between JSON-LD and the 
          serialization syntax described here, specifically:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              JSON-LD uses field names with a leading "@" character,
              such as "@id", "@type" and "@language". In this 
              specification, the leading "@" is omitted.
            </t>
            <t>
              While JSON-LD allows using relative IRI references
              in the values of ID properties, this specification 
              limits identifiers to absolute IRIs.
            </t>
            <t>
              While it is possible to derive a JSON-LD "context" description
              for the Activity Streams 2.0 JSON syntax one is not normatively
              provided by this specification.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        
      </section>
      
      <section anchor="serialization" title="Syntax Conventions">
        
        <t>
          This specification defines a <xref target="RFC4627">JSON-based</xref> 
          serialization syntax.
        </t>
        
        <t>
          When serialized, absent properties are represented either
          by setting the property value to null or by omitting the 
          property declaration altogether at the option of the publisher; 
          these representations are semantically equivalent. If a
          property has an array value, the absence of any items in that array 
          MUST be represented by omitting the property entirely or by setting
          the value to null.
        </t>

        <t>
          This specification uses IRIs <xref target="RFC3987"/>.
          Every URI <xref target="RFC3986" /> is also an IRI, so a URI may be used
          wherever below an IRI is named.  There are two special considerations:
          (1) when an IRI that is not also a URI is given for dereferencing, it
          MUST be mapped to a URI using the steps in Section 3.1 of
          <xref target="RFC3987"/> and (2) when an IRI is serving as
          an "id" value, it MUST NOT be so mapped.
        </t>

        <t>
          Unless otherwise specified, all properties with date and
          time values MUST conform to the "date-time" production in 
          <xref target="RFC3339" />, with an uppercase "T" character 
          used to separate date and time, and an uppercase "Z" character 
          in the absence of a numeric time zone offset. All such timestamps 
          SHOULD be represented relative to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

            Objects SHOULD contain a single "id" property. If an object

          Link values represent references to other objects and resources. 
          They are expressed as either: (1) a String containing an
          absolute or relative IRI, (2) an <xref target="object">Object</xref>,
          or (3) a JSON Array containing a mixture of IRIs or 
          <xref target="object">Objects</xref>. Link values are closely related 
          to the conceptual model of Links as established in 
          <xref target="RFC5988"/>, but have a serialization that is 
          compatible with the JSON-serialization for Linked Data.

          For instance, as defined in previously, all

          "image" property whose value describes a graphical 
          representation of the containing object. This property
          will typically be used to provide the URL to a JPEG,
          GIF or PNG type resource that can be displayed to 
          the user. Any given object might have multiple such visual 
          representations -- multiple screenshots, for instance, or 
          the same image at different resolutions. Based on the 
          JSON-LD approach, there are essentially three ways of 
          describing these references.

        <figure><preamble>To reference a single image without any

        <t>
          RFC 5988 defines that all Links have a "link relation" 
          that describes the contextual purpose of the link. Within 
          an Activity Streams document, in the absence of a specific

          Activity objects are specializations of the base
          <xref target="object">Object</xref> type that provide
          metadata about potential or completed actions.
        </t>
        
        <t>
          Within an Activity object, the "verb" property is used
          to identify the type of activity. All existing verb definitions 
          used in JSON Activity Streams 1.0 implementations can continue 
          to be used and retain their existing semantics. If the "verb" 
          is not specified, the "type" property MAY be used as an 
          alternative means of determining the activity type.
        </t>

        <t>
          Activity objects extend the core <xref target="object">object</xref>
          definition with the following additional, optional properties:

          <c>verb</c>
          <c>IRI</c>
          <c>
            Identifies the type of activity. An activity SHOULD contain a "verb"
            property whose value matches either the "isegment-nz-nc" or the 
            "IRI" production in <xref target="RFC3987"/>. The use of a relative 
            reference other than a simple name is not allowed. If the "verb"
            property is not specified, the activity MUST contain a "type" 
            property.
          </c>

          <c>actor</c>
          <c><xref target="link">Link</xref> value</c>
          <c>

          <c>
            Describes one or more entities involved with the performance
            of the activity who are not the primary performer as specified
            by "actor".
          </c>

          <c>object</c>
          <c><xref target="link">Link</xref> value</c>
          <c>
            Describes the primary object of the activity. For instance,
            in the activity, "John saved a movie to his wishlist", the object
            of the activity is "movie". An activity SHOULD contain an
            "object" property. If the "object" property is not contained, the
            primary object of the activity MAY be implied by context.
          </c>

          <c>target</c>
          <c><xref target="link">Link</xref> value</c>
          <c>
            Describes the target of the activity. The precise meaning of the
            activity's target is dependent on the activities "verb",
            but will often be the object the English preposition "to".
            For instance, in the activity, "John saved a movie to his
            wishlist", the target of the activity is "wishlist". The activity
            target MUST NOT be used to identity an indirect object that is
            not a target of the activity.
          </c>

          <c>result</c>
          <c><xref target="link">Link</xref> value</c>
          <c>
            Describes the result of the activity. For instance, if a particular
            action results in the creation of a new resource, the "result" 
            property can be used to describe that new resource.
          </c>
          
          <c>context</c>
          <c><xref target="link">Link</xref> value</c>
          <c>
            The "context" property allows the Activity to further include 
            information about why a particular action occurred by providing 
            details about the context within which a particular action was 
            performed. The value of the context property is 
            <xref target="link">Link</xref> value.

          <c>priority</c>
          <c>Decimal Number between 0.00 and 1.00</c>
          <c>
            An indicator of the relative priority or importance that
            the creator of an Activity object considers the object to
            have. Represented as a numeric decimal between 0.00 and 1.00,
            with two decimal places of precision. If the property is
            omitted, or expicitly set to null, the assumption is that
            no explicit priority or importance can be assumed. All other
            values falling between 0.00 and 1.00 indicate increasing 
            priority.

          <t>
            The presence of the "priority" property does not impose any 
            specific processing or display requirements on the part of any 
            entity consuming the activity.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            Expressing the value as a range of numeric decimal values is intended
            to provide the greatest level of flexibility in the expression and
            consumption of prioritization detail.  It is expected that
            implementors consuming activity objects containing "priority" will
            utilize and expose the additional information in a number of
            different ways depending on the unique requirements of each
            application use case.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            Many existing systems do not represent priority values as
            numeric ranges.  Such systems might use fixed, labeled brackets
            such as "low", "normal" and "high" or "urgent".  Similar mechanisms
            can be established, by convention, when using the "priority"
            property.  In typical use, it is RECOMMENDED that implementations
            wishing to work with such defined categories treat "priority"
            property values in the range 0.00 to 0.25 as "low" priority; values
            greater than 0.25 to 0.75 as "normal" priority; and values greater
            than 0.75 to 1.00 as "high" priority.  Specific implementations are
            free to establish alternative conventions for the grouping of
            priority values with the caveat that such conventions likely will 
            not be understood by all implementations.

        <section anchor="audience-targeting" title="Audience Targeting Properties">
      
          <t>
            Every Activity has both a Primary and Secondary audience. The 
            Primary audience consists of those entities either directly 
            involved in the performance of the activity or who "own" the 
            objects involved. The Secondary audience consists of the 
            collection of entities sharing an interest in the activity but 
            who are not directly involved (e.g. "followers").
          </t>

          <t>
            For instance, suppose a social network of three individuals: 
            Bob, Joe and Jane. Bob and Joe are each friends with Jane but 
            not friends with one another. Bob has chosen to "follow" activities 
            for which Jane is directly involved. Jane shares a file with Joe.
          </t>

          <t>
            In this example, Jane and Joe are each directly involved in the 
            file sharing activity and together make up the Primary Audience 
            for that event. Bob, having an interest in activities involving 
            Jane, is the Secondary Audience. Knowing this, a system that 
            produces or consumes the activity can intelligently notify each 
            person of the event.
          </t>

          <t>
            While there are means, based on the verb, actor, object and 
            target of the activity, to infer the primary audience for many 
            types of activities, those do not work in every case and do not
            provide a means of identifying the secondary audience. The 
            "to", "cc", "bto" and "bcc" properties MAY be used within an 
            Activity to explicitly identify the Primary and Secondary 
            audiences.

          <t>
            The prototypical use case for an Activity containing these
            properties is the publication and redistribution of Activities 
            through an intermediary. That is, an event source generates the 
            activity and publishes it to the intermediary which determines 
            a subset of events to display to specific individual users or 
            groups. Such a determination can be made, in part, by identifying 
            the Primary and Secondary Audiences for each activity.
          </t>

          <t>
            When the event source generates the activity and specifies values 
            for the to and cc fields, the intermediary SHOULD redistribute 
            that event with the values of those fields intact, allowing any 
            processor to see who the activity has been targeted to. This is 
            precisely the same model used by the to and cc fields in email 
            systems.
          </t>

          <t>
            There are situations, however, in which disclosing the identity 
            of specific members of the audience may be inappropriate. For 
            instance, a user may not wish to let other users know that they 
            are interested in various topics, individuals or types of events. 
            To support this option, an event source generating an activity 
            MAY use the "bto" and "bcc" properties to list entities to whom the 
            activity should be privately targeted. When an intermediary 
            receives an activity containing these properties, it MUST remove 
            those values prior to redistributing the activity. The intent is
            that systems MUST consider entities listed within the "bto" and
            "bcc" properties as part of the Primary and Second audience but 
            MUST NOT disclose that fact to any other party.
          </t>
      
          <t>
            Audience targeting information included within an Activity only 
            describes the intent of the activity creator. With clear exception 
            given to the appropriate handling of "bto" and "bcc", this 
            specification leaves it up to implementations to determine how 
            the audience targeting information is used.

          Collection objects are a specialization of the base
          <xref target="object">Object</xref> that contain a 
          listing of other <xref target="object">objects</xref>
          The Collection object is used primarily as the root of an
          Activity Streams document as described in <xref target="document"/>,
          but can be used as the value of object properties.

          Collections have both a logical model and a physical 
          serialization. While the logical view of a collection
          might contain a large number of objects, any single 
          serialized representation might include only a subset 
          of those objects, with specific <xref target="link">Link</xref>
          values used to reference additional serialized representations
          that include additional subsets. Such representations are known 
          as "multi-page collections", with each serialized subset 
          representing a single "page".
        </t>
        
        <t>
          The value of the Collection object's "type" property MUST

            that have occurred with respect to any given object. For instance,
            a "note" object may have been "shared" or "liked" a number of 
            times by different individuals. In such cases, the Collection 
            object is used as a property value with the "totalItems" field
            used to indicate the total number of occurrences, the "items" 
            property used to provide details for a subset of the most 
            recent occurrences, and the "id" property used to reference a

        specification in ways that are not backwards compatible. Implementations
        can choose to continue supporting the JSON Activity Streams 1.0 syntax
        but SHOULD consider it to be deprecated. This means that while 
        implementations MAY continue to consume the 1.0 syntax, they SHOULD NOT
        output the 1.0 syntax unless specifically interacting with older 
        non-2.0 compliant implementations.

            Implementations MUST use the "application/stream+json" MIME media

            conforming to the 1.0 syntax, and "application/activity+json"

            the syntax and processing rules set by 
            <xref target="activitystreams-1.0"/>. The 2.0 syntax and

            This document renames the 1.0 "objectType" property to "type"

            which means their values can be expressed as either a 
            String or a JSON-LD Language Map. In the 1.0 syntax, these are 
            expressed solely as String values. Because the 1.0 values
            are a valid subset allowed by this specification, implementations

            This document redefines a large number of common properties 
            defined originally as Objects in 1.0 as 
            <xref target="link">Link values</xref>. This means the 
            property values can be expressed as either an IRI String, 
            an Object, or an Array of IRI Strings and Objects. Because the 1.0 
            values are a valid subset allowed by this specification,

            This specification replaces the "upstreamDuplicates" and

            with a singular "duplicates" property with a 
            <xref target="link">Link value</xref>. The "upstreamDuplicates"
            and "downstreamDuplicates" property values in 1.0 are defined

        The values of multiple <xref target="object">Object</xref>

          Optional parameters: "charset" : Specifies the character set encoding.
          If not specified, a default of "UTF-8" is assumed.
        </t>
        <t>
          Encoding considerations: Resources that use the "application/activity+json"
          media type are required to conform to the "application/json" Media Type
          and are therefore subject to the same encoding considerations
          specified in <xref target="RFC4627">Section 6</xref>.
        </t>
        <t>Security considerations: As defined in this specification</t>
        <t>Published specification: This specification.</t>
        <t>
          Applications that use this media type: JSON Activity Streams are implemented
          by a wide range of existing applications.

      <t>
        While the Activity Streams 2.0 syntax is designed to be compatible 
        with JSON-LD, in order to successfully process an Activity Streams
        document as JSON-LD, a "@context" description needs to be provided.
        The following example illustrates an Activity Streams document
        that can be processed as JSON-LD containing Schema.org defined 
        metadata elements.
