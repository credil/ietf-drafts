             draft-ietf-kitten-kerberos-iana-registries-01

Abstract

   The Keberos 5 network authentication protocol has several numeric
   protocol parameters.  Most of these parameters are not currently
   under IANA maintenance.  This document requests that IANA take over
   the maintenance of the remainder of these Kerberos parameters.

Internet-Draft          Kerberos IANA registries           February 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Keberos 5 network authentication protocol[RFC4120][RFC1510] has
   several numeric protocol parameters.  This document requests that
   IANA take over the maintenance of the Kerberos protocol parameters
   that are not currently under IANA maintenance.  Several instances of
   number conflicts in Kerberos implementations could have been
   prevented by having IANA registries for those numbers.  This document
   updates [RFC4120].


2.  General registry format

   Unless otherwise specified, each Kerberos protocol number registry
   will have the following fields: "number", "name", "reference", and
   "comments".

   The name must begin with a lowercase letter, and must consist of
   ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens.  Two or more hyphens must not
   appear directly adjacent to each other.  A hyphen must not appear at
   the end of a name.  It is preferred that words in a name be separated
   by hyphens, and that all of the letters be lowercase.

   (These rules are consistent with the lexical rules for an ASN.1
   valuereference or identifier.  Where the constraints are stricter
   than the ASN.1 lexical rules, they make it easier to systematically
   transform the names for use in implementation languages.)

   Names for numeric parameter values have no inherent meaning in the
   Kerberos protocol, but they can guide choices for internal
   implementation symbol names and for user-visible non-numeric
   representations.  When written in English prose in specifications, or
   when used as symbolic constants in implementation languages (e.g., C
   preprocessor macros), it is common to transform the name into all
   uppercase letters, and possibly to replace hyphens with underscores.


3.  General registration procedure

   This document requests that the IESG establish a pool of Kerberos
   experts who will manage the Kerberos registries using these
   guidelines.  The IESG may wish to consider including the set of
   designated IANA experts for existing Kerberos IANA registries as
   candidates for this pool.

   IANA will select an expert from this pool for each registration
   request.  The expert will review the registration request and may
   approve the registration, decline the registration with comments, or

Internet-Draft          Kerberos IANA registries           February 2013


   recommend that the registration request should follow a specific
   alternative process.  The alternative processes that the expert may
   recommend are the IETF review process and the standards action
   process.

   Initially, the experts reviewers will use a permissive process,
   generally approving registrations that are architecturally consistent
   with Kerberos and the protocol parameter in question.  Over time,
   with input from the community, the experts may refine the
   requirements that registrations are expected to meet.  The experts
   will maintain a current version of these guidelines in a manner that
   is generally accessible to the entire community.  As the guidelines
   evolve, experts may consider the technical quality of specifications,
   security impacts of the registrations, architectural consistency, and
   interoperability impact.  Experts may require a publicly available
   specification in order to make certain registrations.

   [ For the individual registries, include "Registrations in this
   registry are managed by the expert review process [RFC5226] or in
   exceptional cases by IESG approval.  See section x for guidelines for
   the experts to be used with this registry." ]


4.  Integer assignments

   Names for integer assignments must be unique across all Kerberos
   integer parameter registries.  This is normally accomplished by
   including a name prefix that identifies the registry.

   Assignments for integers parameters will follow the general
   registration procedure outlined above, except as otherwise noted in
   the section that contains the description of the parameter.  Kerberos
   integer parameters take on signed 32-bit values (-2147483648 to
   2147483647).  Negative values are for private or local use.

4.1.  Address types

   Registry name:      Address types
   Assignment policy:  General registration procedure
   Valid values:       Signed 32-bit integers

   Address types historically align with numeric constants used in the
   Berkeley sockets API.  Future address type assignments should conform
   to this historical practice when possible.  The name prefix for
   address types is "addrtype-".

4.2.  Authorization data types

   Registry name:      Authorization data types
   Assignment policy:  General registration procedure
   Valid values:       Signed 32-bit integers

   The name prefix for authorization data types is "ad-".

4.3.  Error codes

   Registry name:      Error codes
   Assignment policy:  Standards action
   Valid values:       Signed 32-bit integers

   Assignments for error codes require standards action due to their
   scarcity: assigning error codes greater than 127 could require
   significant changes to certain implementations.  The name prefixes
   for error codes are "kdc-err-", "krb-err-", and "krb-ap-err-".

4.4.  Key usages

   Registry name:      Key usages
   Assignment policy:  General registration procedure
   Valid values:       Unsigned 32-bit integers

   Key usages are unsigned 32-bit integers (0 to 4294967295).  Zero is
   reserved and may not be assigned.

   The name prefix for key usages is "ku-".

4.5.  Name types

   Registry name:      Name types
   Assignment policy:  General registration procedure
   Valid values:       Signed 32-bit integers

   The name prefix for name types is "nt-".

4.6.  Pre-authentication and typed data

   Registry name:      Pre-authentication and typed data
   Assignment policy:  General registration procedure
   Valid values:       Signed 32-bit integers

   This document requests that IANA modify the existing Kerberos Pre-
   authentication and typed data registry to be consistent with the
   procedures in this document.

   The name prefix for pre-authentication type numbers is "pa-".  The
   name prefix for typed data numbers is "td-".  Pre-authentication and
   typed data numbers are in the same registry, but a pre-authentication
   number may be also be assigned to a related typed data number.


5.  Named bit assignments

   Assignments for named bits require standards action, due to their
   scarcity: assigning bit numbers greater than 31 could require

Internet-Draft          Kerberos IANA registries           February 2013


   significant changes to implementations.  Names for named bit
   assignments must be unique within a given named bit registry, and
   typically do not have name prefixes that identify which registry they
   belong to.

5.1.  AP-REQ options

   Registry name:      AP-REQ options
   Assignment policy:  Standards action
   Valid values:       ASN.1 bit numbers 0 through 31

5.2.  KDC-REQ options

   Registry name:      KDC-REQ options
   Assignment policy:  Standards action
   Valid values:       ASN.1 bit numbers 0 through 31

5.3.  Ticket flags

   Registry name:      Ticket flags
   Assignment policy:  Standards action
   Valid values:       ASN.1 bit numbers 0 through 31


6.  Contributors

   Sam Hartman proposed the text of the expert review guidelines.  Love
   Hornquist Astrand wrote a previous document
   (draft-lha-krb-wg-some-numbers-to-iana-00) with the same goals as
   this document.


7.  Acknowledgments

   Thanks to Tom Petch for providing useful feedback on previous
   versions of this document.


8.  Security Considerations

   Assignments of new Keberos protocol parameter values can have
   security implications.  In cases where the assignment policy calls
   for expert review, the reviewer is responsible for evaluating whether
   adequate documentation exists concerning the security considerations
   for the requested assignment.  For assignments that require IETF
   review or standards action, the normal IETF processes ensure adequate
   treatment of security considerations.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA create several registries for
   Kebreros protocol parameters:
   o  Address types
   o  Authorization data types
   o  Error codes
   o  Key usages
   o  Name types
   o  AP-REQ options
   o  KDC-REQ options
   o  Ticket flags

   This document requests that IANA modify the existing "Pre-
   authentication data and typed data" registry to contain an additional
   reference to this document, and to transform existing names in that
   registry to the lowercase-and-hyphens style.


10.  Open issues

   Do we make a registry for application tag numbers (equal to message
   type numbers)?  We've said that we would replace the entire ASN.1
   module in that case, but Nico's recent proposal doesn't do that, and
   if we want to accommodate that sort of proposal, it would probably be
   best to establish a registry.  (It should require standards action
   for registrations.)

   Do transited encodings need a registry?  They would probably require
   standards action, even if there were a registry.
