       Using UDP Checksum Trailers in the Network Time Protocol (NTP)
                 draft-mizrahi-ntp-checksum-trailer-00.txt


Abstract

   The Network Time Protocol (NTP) allows clients to synchronize to a
   time server using timestamped protocol messages. To faciliate
   accurate timestamping, some implementations use hardware-based
   timestamping engines that integrate the accurate transmission time
   into every outgoing NTP packet during transmission. Since these
   packets are transported over UDP, the UDP checksum field is then
   updated to reflect this modification. This document proposes an
   extension field that includes a 2-octet Checksum Trailer, allowing
   timestamping engines to reflect the checksum modification in the last
   2 octets of the packet rather than in the UDP checksum field. The
   behavior defined in this document is interoperable with existing NTP
   implementations.

1. Introduction

   The Network Time Protocol [NTPv4] allows clients to synchronize their
   clocks to a time server by exchanging NTP packets. The increasing
   demand for highly accurate clock synchronization motivates
   implementations that provide accurate timestamping.

1.1. Intermediate Entities

   In this document we use the term 'intermediate entity', referring to
   an entity that reside on the path between the sender and the receiver
   of an NTP packet, that modifies this NTP packet en-route. Two
   examples of intermediate entities are presented below.

   In order to facilitate accurate timestamping, an implementation MAY
   use a hardware based timestamping engine, as shown in Figure 1. In
   such cases, NTP packets are sent and received by a software layer,
   whereas a timestamping engine modifies every outgoing NTP packet by
   incorporating its accurate transmission time into the <Transmit
   Timestamp> field in the packet.

   The accuracy of clock synchronization over packet networks is highly
   sensitive to delay jitters in the underlying network, which
   dramatically affects the clock accuracy. To address this challenge,
   the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) [IEEE1588] defines Transparent
   Clocks (TCs), intermediate switches and routers that improve the end-
   to-end accuracy by updating a "Correction Field" in the PTP packet by
   adding the latency caused by the current TC. In NTP no equivalent
   entity is currently defined, but future versions of NTP may define an
   intermediate node that modifies en-route NTP packets using a
   "Correction Field".

1.2. Updating the UDP Checksum

   When the UDP payload is modified by an intermediate entity, the UDP
   Checksum field needs to be updated to maintain its correctness. When
   using UDP over IPv4 ([UDP]), an intermediate entity can assign a
   value of zero in the checksum field, causing the receiver to ignore
   the checksum field. UDP over IPv6, as defined in [IPv6], does not
   allow a zero checksum, and requires the UDP checksum field to contain
   a correct checksum of the UDP payload.

   Since an intermediate entity only modifies a specific field in the
   packet, i.e. the timestamp field, the UDP checksum update can be
   performed incrementally, using the concepts presented in [Checksum].

   A similar problem is addressed in Annex E of [IEEE1588]. When the
   Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is transported over IPv6, two octets
   are appended to the end of the PTP payload for UDP checksum updates.
   The value of these two octets can be updated by an intermediate
   entity, causing the value of the UDP checksum field to remain
   correct.

   This document defines a similar concept for [NTP], allowing
   intermediate entities to update NTP packets and maintain the
   correctness of the UDP checksum by modifying the last 2 octests of
   the packet. This is performed by adding an NTP extension field at the
   end of the packet, in which the last two bytes are used as a checksum
   trailer.

   The term Checksum Trailer is used throughout this document and refers
   to the 2 octets at the end of the UDP payload, used for updating the
   UDP checksum by intermediate entities.

   The usage of the Checksum Trailer can in some cases simplify the
   implementation, since if the packet data is processed in a serial
   order, it is simpler to first update the timestamp field, and then
   update the Checksum Trailer rather than to update the timestamp and
   then update the UDP checksum, residing at the UDP header.

3. Using UDP Checksum Trailers in NTP

3.1. Overview

   The UDP Checksum Trailer is a two-octet trailer that is appended at
   the end of the UDP payload using an NTP extension field. Figure 2
   illustrates the packet format of an NTP packet with a Checksum
   Trailer extension. The figure illustrates an unauthenticated NTP
   packet. Section 3.4.  provides further details about using the
   Checksum Trailer in authenticated packets.

   NTP packets may include one or more extension fields, as defined in
   [NTPv4]. The Checksum Trailer in NTP packets resides in a dedicated
   NTP extension field, as shown in Figure 2.

   In unauthenticated mode, if the NTP packet includes more than one
   extension field, the Checksum Trailer extension is always the last
   extension field. Thus, when NTP authentication is disabled, the
   Checksum Trailer is the last 2 octets in the UDP payload, and thus
   the trailer is located at UDP Length - 2 octets after the beginning
   of the UDP header.

   When NTP authentication is enabled, the Checksum Trailer is the last
   2 octets before the Message Authentication Code (MAC).

   Field Type

     A dedicated Field Type value is used to identify the Checksum
      Trailer extension. See Section 6 for further details.

   Length

     The Checksum Trailer extension field length is 28 octets.

     This length guarantees that the host that receives the packet
      parses it correctly, whether the packet includes a MAC or not.
      [NTP-Ext] provides further details about the length of an
      extension field in the absence of a MAC.

   Padding

     The extension field includes 22 octets of padding. This field
      SHOULD be set to 0, and SHOULD be ignored by the recipient.

   Checksum Trailer

     Includes the UDP Checksum Trailer field.

3.2.1. Transmission of NTP with Checksum Trailer

   The transmitter of an NTP packet MAY include a Checksum Trailer
   extension field.

3.2.2. Intermediate Updates of NTP with Checksum Trailer

   An intermediate node that receives and alters an NTP packet
   containing a Checksum Trailer extension MAY use the Checksum Trailer
   to maintain a correct UDP checksum value.

3.2.3. Reception of NTP with Checksum Trailer

   This document does not impose new requirements on the receiving end
   of an NTP packet.

   The UDP layer at the receiving end verifies the UDP Checksum of
   received NTP packets, and the NTP layer SHOULD ignore the Checksum
   Trailer extension field.

3.3. Interoperability with Existing Implementations

   The behavior defined in this document does not impose new
   requirements on the reception of NTP packets. Thus, transmitters and
   intermediate nodes that support the Checksum Trailer can
   transparently interoperate with existing implementations.

3.4. Using the Checksum Trailer with or without Authentication

   When message authentication is used, intermediate entities that alter
   test packets must also re-compute the Message Authentication Code
   (MAC) accordingly. The MAC update typically requires the intermediate
   entity to store the packet, re-compute its MAC, and then forward it.

   Figure 4 illustrates the format of an authenticated NTP packet with a
   Checksum Trailer extension.

           Figure 4 Checksum Trailer in NTP Authenticated Packets

   While a Checksum Trailer MAY be used when authentication is enabled,
   in practice the Checksum Trailer is more useful in unauthenticated
   mode, allowing the intermediate entity to perform serial processing
   of the packet without storing-and-forwarding it.

4. Security Considerations

   This document describes how a Checksum Trailer extension can be used
   for updating the checksum. This concept is logically equivalent to an
   intermediate node that directly modifies the UDP Checksum field, and
   thus does not present any new security implications.

   As described in Section 3.4. , the concept described in this document
   is especially useful for unauthenticated mode. However, this document
   does not make a statement about the circumstances in which
   authentication should or should not be used.

5. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate an NTP extension Field Type value for
   the Checksum Trailer extension.
