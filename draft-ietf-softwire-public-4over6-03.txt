                  Public IPv4 over IPv6 Access Network
                  draft-ietf-softwire-public-4over6-03

Abstract

   When the service provider networks are upgraded to IPv6, end users
   will continue to demand IPv4 connectivity.  This document proposes a
   mechanism for hosts or customer networks in IPv6 access network to
   build bidirectional IPv4 communication with the IPv4 Internet.  The
   mechanism follows the hub and spokes softwire model, and uses IPv4-
   over-IPv6 tunnel as basic method to traverse IPv6 network.  The bi-
   directionality of this IPv4 communication is achieved by explicitly
   allocating public IPv4 addresses to end users, as well as maintaining
   IPv4-IPv6 address binding on the border relay.

1.  Introduction

   When deploying IPv6 networks, IPv4 connectivity is still a required
   functionality by end users.  It is used for IPv4 communicate with
   IPv4-only part of the Internet during the IPv4-IPv6 transition
   period.  IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel mechanisms are the general solutions
   to provide this type of IPv4 services.

   While different IPv4-over-IPv6 mechanisms are developed for different
   application scenarios, the mechanism proposed in this document
   focuses on provide full end-to-end transparency to the user-side.
   Therefore, carrier-side address translation should be avoided and
   public IPv4 addresses should be provisioned to end users.  Further
   more, full address is preferred than port-restricted address.  With
   full address provisioned, user-side address translation is not
   necessarily needed either.  This means minimal changes to the user
   side: operating system could support the mechanism smoothly, while
   transparency on upper-layer applications is guaranteed.  For many
   ISPs which are actually capable of provisioning full IPv4 addresses,
   the mechanism provide a pure, suitable solution.

   Another focus of this mechanism is deployment and operation
   flexibility.  This mechanism keeps IPv4-IPv6 addressing independent:
   end user IPv4 address is not embedded in its IPv6 address.  The IPv6
   infrastructure in the middle is not involved with the IPv4-over-IPv6
   mechanism, so no special network planning is required; the service
   can be easily provided in on-demand style; the IPv4 address resources
   can be managed in a flat, centralized manner rather than distributed
   to customer sites with IPv6.  The tradeoff is per-subscriber binding
   state maintenance on the border relay.

   The mechanism follows hub and spokes softwire model, and uses IPv4-
   over-IPv6 tunnel between end host or CPE and border relay as basic
   data plane method.  Full IPv4 addresses are allocated from the ISP to
   the end host or CPE over IPv6 network.  Simultaneously, the binding
   between the allocated IPv4 address and the end user's IPv6 address
   are maintained on the border relay for encapsulation usage.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   Public 4over6: Public 4over6 is a per-subscriber stateful, IPv4-over-
   IPv6 tunnel mechanism proposed by this document.  Public 4over6

Internet-Draft                Public 4over6                  August 2012


   supports bidirectional communication between IPv4 Internet and IPv4
   hosts or customer networks in IPv6 access network, by leveraging
   IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel and public IPv4 address allocation over IPv6.

   4over6 Customer Edge (CE): A device functioning as a Customer Edge
   equipment in Public 4over6 environment.  The 4over6 CE can be either
   a dual-stack capable host, or a dual-stack CPE device, both have a
   tunnel interface to support IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation.  In the
   former case, the host supports both IPv4 and IPv6 stack but is
   provisioned with IPv6 only.  In the latter case, the CPE has an IPv6
   interface connecting to ISP network, and an IPv4 interface connecting
   to customer network; hosts in the customer network can be IPv4-only.

   4over6 Border Relay (BR): A router functioning as the border relay in
   Public 4over6 environment. 4over6 BR is the IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel
   concentrator located in IPv6 ISP network.  It is a dual-stack router
   which connects to both the IPv6 ISP network and IPv4 Internet.

4.  Scenario and Use Cases

   The general scenario of Public 4over6 is shown in Figure 1.  Users in
   an IPv6 network take IPv6 as their native service.  Some users are
   end hosts which face the ISP network directly, while the others are
   customer networks behind CPEs, such as a home LAN, an enterprise
   network, etc.  The ISP network is IPv6-only rather than dual-stack,
   which means the ISP cannot provide native IPv4 service to users.
   However, it is acceptable that some router(s) on the carrier side
   becomes dual-stack and connects to IPv4 Internet.  So if network
   users require IPv4 connectivity, the dual-stack router(s) will work
   as their "entrance".

   Public 4over6 can be applicable in several use cases.  If an ISP

   which switches to IPv6 still has plenty of IPv4 address resource, it
   can deploy Public 4over6 to provide transparent IPv4 service for all
   its customers.  If the ISP does not have so much IPv4 addresses, it
   can deploy Dual-Stack Lite [RFC6333] as the basic IPv4-over-IPv6
   service.  Along with DS-Lite, Public 4over6 can be deployed as a
   value-added service, overcoming the service degradation caused by the
   CGN.  The two mechanisms can be integrated easily.  A typical case of
   the high-end users that could use Public 4over6 is IPv4 application
   server.  Full, public IPv4 address brings significant convenience in
   this case.  The DNS registration can be direct using dedicated
   address; the access of the application service can be
   straightforward, with no translation involved; there will be no need
   to hold the "pinhole" for incoming traffic, and no well-known port
   collision will come up.

   The main steps are:

   o  Provision IPv6 address to 4over6 CE, along with the information of

      4over6 BR's IPv6 address, by DHCPv6 or other means.

   o  4over6 CE configures its WAN interface, as a result of IPv6
      provisioning.

   o  Provision IPv4 address to 4over6 CE, by DHCPv4 over IPv6 or static
      configuration.

   o  Synchronize the IPv4-IPv6 address binding between DHCPv4 server
      and 4over6 BR, at the same time with DHCPv4 provisioning.

   o  4over6 CE configures its tunnel interface, as a result of IPv4
      provisioning.

   o  4over6 BR updates the IPv4-IPv6 address binding table, as a result
      of address binding synchronization.

5.2.  Public IPv4 Address Allocation

   Usually each CE is provisioned with one public IPv4 address.  However
   it is possible that a CE would require an IPv4 prefix.  The key
   problem here is the mechanism for IPv4 address provisioning over IPv6
   network.

   There are two possibilities here: DHCPv4 over IPv6, and static
   configuration.  Public 4over6 MUST support both.  DHCPv4 over IPv6
   enables DHCPv4 message to be transported in IPv6 rather than IPv4;
   therefore, the DHCPv4 process can be performed over an IPv6 network,
   between BR and CE.  [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6] describes the
   DHCP protocol extensions to support that.  As to static
   configuration, 4over6 users and the ISP operators MUST negotiate
   beforehand to authorize the IPv4 address(es).  Then the tunnel
   interface and the address binding are configured by the user and the
   ISP respectively.

   While regular users would probably take DHCPv4 over IPv6, the manual
   configuration is usually seen in two cases: application server, which
   requires a stable IPv4 address, and enterprise network, which usually
   requires an IPv4 prefix rather than one single address (Note that
   DHCPv4 does not support prefix allocation).

6.  4over6 CE Behavior

   A CE MUST be provisioned with IPv6 before Public 4over6.  It MUST
   also learn the BR's IPv6 address.  This IPv6 address can be
   configured using a variety of methods, ranging from an out-of-band
   mechanism, manual configuration, or DHCPv6 option.  In order to
   guarantee interoperability, the CE element SHOULD implement the

Internet-Draft                Public 4over6                  August 2012


   DHCPv6 option defined in [RFC6334].

   A CE MUST support DHCPv4 over IPv6[I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6], to
   dynamically require IPv4 address over IPv6 and assign it to the IPv4-
   in-IPv6 tunnel interface.  It MUST also support static configuration
   of the tunnel interface.  In the case of prefix provisioning, Well-
   Known IPv4 Address defined in section 5.7 of [RFC6333] SHOULD be
   assigned to the tunnel interface, rather than using an address from
   the prefix.  If the CE has multiple IPv6 addresses on its WAN
   interface, it MUST use the same IPv6 address for DHCPv4 over IPv6/
   negotiation of manual configuration, and for data plane
   encapsulation.

   A CE performs IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation and decapsulation on the
   tunnel interface.  When sending out an IPv4 packet, it performs the
   encapsulation, using the IPv6 address of the 4over6 BR as the IPv6
   destination address, and its own IPv6 address as the IPv6 source
   address.  The decapsulation on 4over6 CE is simple.  When receiving
   an IPv4-in-IPv6 packet, the CE just removes the IPv6 header, and
   either hands it to upper layer or forward it to customer network
   according to the IPv4 destination address.

   A CE runs a regular IPv4 NAPT for its customer network when it is
   provisioned with one single IPv4 address.  In that case, the assigned
   IPv4 address of the tunnel interface would be the external IPv4
   address of the NAPT.  Then the CE performs IPv4 private-to-public
   translation before encapsulation of IPv4 packets from the customer
   network, and IPv4 public-to-private translation after decapsulation
   of IPv4-in-IPv6 packets.

   IPv4 NAPT is not necessarily when the CE is provisioned with an IPv4
   prefix.  In this case, the detailed customer network planning is out
   of scope.

7.  4over6 BR Behavior

   4over6 BR maintains the bindings between the CE IPv6 address and CE
   IPv4 address (prefixes).  The bindings are used to provide correct
   encapsulation destination address for inbound IPv4 packets, as well
   as validate the IPv6-IPv4 source of the outbound IPv4-in-IPv6
   packets.

   The BR MUST synchronize the binding information with the IPv4 address
   provisioning process.  For static configuration this is easy: the BR
   configures the binding right after negotiation with the customer.  As
   for DHCPv4-over-IPv6, there are multiple possibilities which are
   deployment-specific:

Internet-Draft                Public 4over6                  August 2012


   o  The BR can be collocated with the DHCPv4-over-IPv6 server.  Then
      the synchronization happens within the BR.  It installs a binding
      when send out an ACK for a DHCP lease, and delete it when the
      lease expires or a DHCP RELEASE is received.

   o  The BR can play the role of TRA as described in
      [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6], and snoop for the DHCPv4 ACK and
      Release messages, as well as keep a timer for each binding
      according to the DHCP lease time.

   o  The BR does not participate in the DHCPv4-over-IPv6 process,
      however, the bindings of the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are static,
      and the same image of the binding information for all users are
      propagated to both DHCPv4-over-IPv6 server and the BR.

   On the IPv6 side, the BR decapsulates IPv4-in-IPv6 packets coming
   from 4over6 CEs.  It removes the IPv6 header of every IPv4-in-IPv6
   packet and forwards it to the IPv4 Internet.  Before the
   decapsulation, the BR MUST check the inner IPv4 source address
   against the outer IPv6 source address, by matching such a binding
   entry in the binding table.  If no binding is found, the BR silently
   drops the packet.  On the IPv4 side, the BR encapsulates the IPv4
   packets destined to 4over6 CEs.  When performing the IPv4-in-IPv6
   encapsulation, the BR uses its own IPv6 address as the IPv6 source
   address, uses the IPv4 destination address in the packet to look up
   IPv6 destination address in the address binding table.  After the
   encapsulation, the BR sends the IPv6 packet on its IPv6 interface to
   reach a CE.

   The BR MUST support hairpinning of traffic between two CEs, by
   performing de-capsulation and re-encapsulation of packets.

8.  Fragmentation and reassembly

   The same considerations as described in section 5.3 and section 6.3
   of [RFC6333] are to be taken into account.

9.  DNS

   The procedure described in Section 5.5 and Section 6.4 of [RFC6333]
   is to be followed.

10.  Security Considerations

   The 4over6 BR SHOULD implement methods to limit service only to
   registered customers.  The first step is to allocate IPv4 addresses
   only to registered customers.  One simple solution is to filter on
   the IPv6 source addresses of incoming DHCP packets and only respond

Internet-Draft                Public 4over6                  August 2012


   to the ones which have registered IPv6 source address.  The BR can
   also perform authentication during DHCP, for example, based on the
   MAC address of the CEs.  As to data packets, the BR can implement an
   IPv6 ingress filter on the tunnel interface to accept only the IPv6
   address range defined in the filter, as well as check the IPv4-IPv6
   source address binding by looking up the binding table.
