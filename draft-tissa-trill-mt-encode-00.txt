1. Introduction

   Multi Topology is an attractive concept that allows to create
   different virtual or overlays on top of a single physical topology.
   There are several important applications. Few of such are listed
   below. The list below is no means an exhaustive list and there are
   other applications that may utilize the MT framework.

   Traffic Engineering

   [RFC5120] presents Multi topology (MT) framework for IS-IS. MT has
   two important parts; IS-IS control plane extensions and Data plane
   encoding. [RFC5120] presents IS-IS control plane extensions. [TRILL-
   MT1] and [TRILL-MT2] presents required IS-IS sub-TLV definitions and
   the data plane encoding for TRILL.

   In this document we propose methods that facilitate encoding of
   12bit Multi topology ID in to TRILL frames without reducing the
   effective TRILL nickname space. Additionally, the proposed scheme
   does not require definition of new Topology mapping sub-TLV. In
   other words, IS-IS control plane is similar to [RFC5120] and does
   not require additional complexity of mapping absolute Topology ID to
   abbreviated topology ID.

   Methods proposed in this document encode the MT topology ID into
   TRILL data frames without modifying the TRILL header. Hence, MT
   capable, RBridges interfacing with non MT capable RBridges can
   selectively not encode the proposed MT extensions on interfaces with
   non MT capable RBridges. Non MT capable RBridges do not required to
   be in the base topology. They can be in any valid topology. Only
   restriction is non MT capable RBridges can belong to a single
   topology only. In its IS-IS HELLO messages, RrRidges exchange its MT
   capability and topology information. RBridges that are not capable
   of supporting proposed MT extension in data plane, MUST announce
   itself as non MT capable, but MAY advertise its association to a
   topology other than the base topology by including MT extensions
   proposed in [RFC5120]. MT encoding capability is announced by
   setting the proposed MT encoding capability bit in Port TRILL
   Version sub-TLV [rfc6326bis]. Presence of IS-IS Multi Topology TLV
   [RFC5120], indicates only the associated topology. MT encoding
   capability indicates RBRidges ability to support proposed data plane
   extensions. When MT capability is not set RBridge MUST not use the
   proposed data plane encoding methods, instead it must associate the
   announcing RBRidge to the advertised topology or base topology in
   the absence of Multi-Topology TLV [RFC5120]

3. Multi Topology Encoding

   [RFC6325] TRILL Base Protocol, proposes encoding scheme of TRILL
   frames. TRILL frames contain outer MAC Header, 802.1QTAG, TRILL
   header and user Data. We propose to include multi topology ID after
   the 802.1Q TAG. Multi Toplogy ID is preceded by Ethernet Type MT-
   ETHTYPE. Figure 1 below depicts the proposed encoding.

   Outer Ethernet Header:
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |             Outer Destination MAC Address                     |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Outer Destination MAC Address | Outer Source MAC Address      |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   |Ethertype = C-Tag [802.1Q-2005]| Outer.VLAN Tag Information    |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Ethertype = MT-ETHTYPE         |          MT-ID                |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |             TRILL Header                                      |
   .                                                               .
   |                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                                                               |

   |                                                               |
   |                                                               |

                    Figure 1 Encoding of MT ID in TRILL

   Required extensions to the IS-IS HELLO to support MT ID encoding is
   presented in the section x.



3.1. Use of Next-Hop VLAN for MT Encoding

   Alternatively, Next-Hop VLAN may be utilized to encode MT ID in
   point to point only networks. Next Hop VLAN on TRILL outer header is
   independent of the inner VLAN. On Point-Pont links Next Hop VLAN is
   only required to be of local significance. Hence, we propose to map
   topologies to Next-Hop VLAN per link basis.

   For sake of simplicity, we propose to map topology-id to Next-VLAN
   based on local policies such as configuration.

4. Interoperability

   There are two possible scenarios of Interoperability with RBridges
   that are non MT capable.

   1. Interoperability During migration
   2. Interoperability with RBridges that are non MT capable in the data
     plane. (i.e. Software is MT aware and supports the extensions
     specified here-in but, data plane is not capable of supporting the
     proposed encoding methods)

4.1. Interoperability during Migration

    We recommend upgrading from the core to the edge, as depicted in
   the figure below. With this approach, different clusters of RBridges
   may belong to different topologies or to the same topology. RBridges
   in the core provide connectivity to RBridge clusters at the edge in
   a topology aware manner.

                      Figure 1 MT aware interconnect

   In the above diagram Core may be configured to connect Edge 1 and
   Edge 2 to a different Topology than the topology of Edge 3 and Edge
   4.

   RBridges in Edge 1 - 4 are not required to be MT capable or aware.
   RBridges in the core associate the corresponding links to the
   appropriate topology.

4.2. Interoperability with RBridges with Non MT capable data plane

   RBridges with Non MT capable data plane may implement MT support by
   dedicating a separate link for each topology.

   Alternatively, RBRidges, on point-point links may assign a different
   next hop VLAN for different topologies and derive topology ID based
   on VLAN. Use Next-Hop VLAN reduce the need for multiple physical

   links.  This method may be utilized as a permanent method for MT
   encoding in Point-Pont only networks.

5. IS-IS sub-TLV definition

5.1. MT capability

   We propose to define two MT capability flags within Port TRILL
   Version sub-TLV.

   1. MT Encoding capability
   2. MT to NH-VLAN Encoding capability

   MT Encoding capability flag indicates the RBridge is capable
   encoding MT ID using ETHTYPE-MT as defined in section 3.

   MT to NH-VLAN Encoding capability flag indicates the announcing
   RBRidge is capable of using NH-VLAN to MT ID mapping as presented in
   section 3.1.

   When both of the flags are set RBRridge SHOULD select MT Encoding
   capability.

6. Security Considerations

   TBD

7. Assignment  Considerations

7.1.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate MT Encoding capability Flag and MT to
   NH-VLAN Encoding capability Flags under Port TRILL version sub-TLV..

7.2. IEEE Considerations

   IEEE is requested to assign new Ether Type to represent MT-ETHTYPE
   defined in section 3.
