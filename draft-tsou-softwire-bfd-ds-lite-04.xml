    <abstract>
      <t>
	In DS-Lite, the tunnel is stateless, not associated with any
	state information, and no failure detection and failover
	mechanism is available. This makes it difficult to manage and
	diagnose if there is a problem. This draft analyzes the
	applicability of some of the possible solutions.

    <section anchor="Problem" title="Introduction">
      <t>
	In <xref target="RFC6333">DS-Lite</xref>, the IPv4-in-IPv6
	DS-Lite tunnel is stateless, no status information about the
	tunnel is available, and no keep-alive mechanism is
	available. It is difficult to know whether the tunnel is up or
	down; and if there is a link problem, the Basic Bridging
	BroadBand (B4) element can not automatically switch to another
	Address Family Transition Router (AFTR) so as to continue the
	network service automatically, without the involvement of
	operators. This lack of failure detection and failover creates
	problems for network operation and maintenance.
      </t>

      <t>
	Possible solutions for failure detection include the usage of
	Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD), the Port Control
	Protocol (PCP), and the Internet Control Message Protocol
	(ICMP). The properties of these solutions are discussed in
	this document and guidelines are provided how to implement
	failure detection and automatic failover.

      <section title="Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)">
        <t>
	  <xref target="RFC5880">Bidirectional Forwarding
          Detection</xref> (BFD) is a mechanism intended to detect
          faults in a bidirectional path. It is usually used in
          conjunction with applications like OSPF, IS-IS, for fast
          fault recovery and fast
          re-route <xref target="RFC5882"></xref>. BFD is being made
          mandatory for keep-alive for subscriber sessions, including
          DS-Lite, by the BroadBand Forum
          (BBF) <xref target="WT-146"></xref>.
	</t>
        <t>
	  BFD can be used in DS-Lite, by creating a BFD session
          between the B4 element and the AFTR to provide tunnel status
          information.  If a fault is detected, the B4 element can try
          to create a DS-Lite tunnel with another AFTR and terminate
          the existing one, so as to continue network service.
	</t>
	<t>
	  <xref target="I-D.vinokour-bfd-dhcp"></xref> proposes using
          a DHCP option to distribute BFD parameters to B4
          elements. But in case of DS-Lite, some of the key BFD
          parameters are already available (e.g., peer IP address),
          and other parameters can be negotiated by BFD signaling or
          statically configured, so that no extra DHCP option(s) need
          to be defined.
	</t>

        <section title="DS-Lite Scenario">
          <t>
	    In <xref target="RFC6333">DS-Lite</xref>, the BFD packet
            SHOULD be sent through an IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel, as shown in
            <xref target="DS-Lite-Scenario"></xref>. The IPv4
            addresses of the B4 element and the AFTR SHOULD be the
            endpoints of a BFD session.

        <section title="Parameters for BFD">
          <t>
	    In order to set up a BFD session, the following parameters
            are needed, as shown in Section 4.1
            of <xref target="RFC5880"></xref>:
	  </t>
          <t><list style="symbols">
              <t>Peer IP address</t>
              <t>My Discriminator</t>
              <t>Your Discriminator</t>
              <t>Desired Min TX Interval</t>
              <t>Required Min RX Interval</t>
              <t>Required Min Echo RX Interval</t>
            </list></t>
          <t>
	    In <xref target="RFC6334">DS-Lite</xref>, the B4's
            WAN-side IPv4 address is the well-known address 192.0.2.2,
            and the AFTR's well-known IPv4 address is 192.0.2.1, as
            defined in section 5.7 of <xref target="RFC6333"></xref>.
            The B4 element needs to create an IPv6 tunnel to an AFTR
            so as to get network connectivity to the AFTR, and send
            IPv4 BFD packets through the tunnel to manage it.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    The other parameters listed above can be negotiated by BFD
            signaling, and initial values can be configured on B4
            elements and AFTRs.
	  </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Elements of Procedure">
          <t>
	    When a B4 element gets online, it will be assigned an IPv6
            prefix or address, and also the FQDN of the AFTR, as
            defined in <xref target="RFC6334"></xref>.  The B4 element
            will create an IPv6 tunnel to the AFTR with which the B4
            element can initiate a BFD session to the AFTR. BFD
            packets will be sent through the DS-Lite tunnel. As
            defined in section 4 of <xref target="RFC5881"></xref>,
            BFD control packets MUST be sent in UDP packets with
            destination port 3784, and BFD echo packets MUST be sent
            in UDP packets with destination port 3785.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    When sending out the first BFD packet, the B4 element can
            generate a unique local discriminator, and set the remote
            discriminator to zero. When the AFTR receives the first
            BFD packet from a B4 element, the AFTR will also generate
            a corresponding local discriminator, and put it in the
            response packet to the B4 element. This will finish the
            discriminator negotiation in the B4 to AFTR direction,
            without any manual configuration.
	  </t>
          <t>
	    When an AFTR receives the first packet from a B4 element,
            the AFTR will get the IPv6 address and discriminator of
            the B4 element, so that the AFTR can initiate the BFD
            session in the other direction and a similar discriminator
            negotiation can be carried out.
	  </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Implementation Considerations">
          <t>
	    BFD is usually used for quick fault detection, at a very
            small time scale, e.g. milliseconds. But in DS-Lite, it
            may not be necessary to detect faults in such a short
            time. On the other hand, an AFTR may need to support tens
            of thousands of B4 elements, which means an AFTR will need
            to support the same number of BFD sessions. In order to
            meet performance requirements on an AFTR, it may be
            necessary to configure the time period between BFD packet
            transmissions to a longer time, e.g., 10s or 30s.
          </t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Port Control Protocol (PCP)">
        <t>
	  <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcp-base-29">PCP</xref> is a NAT
          traversal tool. It can also be used for network connectivity
          test if PCP is supported in the network. A common use case
          of PCP is to create a pinhole so that external users can
          visit the servers located behind a NAT.  The lifetime of the
          pinhole mapping is usually long, e.g., hours, and the
          lifetime will be refreshed periodically by the client before
          it is expired. For the purpose of network connectivity
          tests, a B4 element can create a mapping in the CGN via PCP,
          with a short life time, e.g., 10s of seconds, and keep on
          refreshing the mapping before it expires. If any refresh
          requests fail, the B4 element knows that something is wrong
          with the link or the PCP server or the CGN.
	</t>
        <t>
	  In order to detect the network connectivity of the DS-Lite
          tunnel, the encapsulation mode MUST be used for PCP: PCP
          packets are sent through the DS-Lite tunnel.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)">
        <t>
	  The Echo (Request) and Echo Response messages of the
	  Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) <xref
	  target="RFC0792"/> <xref target="RFC4443"/> can be used to
	  determine whether remote nodes are reachable.  In case of
	  DS-Lite, a B4 element can send Echo (Request) packets to the
	  AFTR periodically. If the B4 element does not receive a
	  certain number (e.g., 3) of Echo Response packets in a
	  certain timeout period, then the B4 element decides that a
	  fault has been detected.
	</t>
        <t>
	  In order to test the connectivity of DS-Lite tunnel, Echo
          (Request) packets MUST be sent using ICMPv4, rather than
          ICMPv6.
	</t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Discussion">
      <t>
	The solutions can be compared based on the failure detection
	time, the overhead on the wire, and the scalability on the
	AFTR. Lets consider an AFTR that needs to support 10000-30000
	subscribers. If every subscriber sends a probe packet every 30
	seconds, this creates a load of 1-3 probe packets per
	millisecond and a failure detection delay in minutes (since
	multiple probe packets may need to fail in order to detect a
	failure). Shorter detection times significantly increase the
	load on AFTRs.
      </t>
      <t>
	BFD has a simple and fixed packet format, which is easy to
	implement by logic devices (e.g., ASIC, FPGA). This allows
	line cards to process BFD packets very efficiently in
	hardware.
      </t>
      <t>
	PCP is a control protocol typically implemented in
	software. As such, processing a large number of PCP requests
	in order to detect failures is relatively expensive. On the
	other hand, PCP can detect the failure of more components of
	the DS-Lite system.  Besides failures of the link and the
	routing, it also covers certain NAT functions.
      </t>
      <t>
	Since ICMP is an integral part of any IP implementation, the
	usage of ICMP messages to detect tunnel failures does not
	require any special implementation efforts on the B4 elements.
	However, on AFTRs that process ICMP messages in software (slow
	path) rather than in hardware, the usage of ICMP messages
	might lead to scalability issues.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Failover">
      <t>
	The FQDN of the AFTR is sent to the B4 element via a DHCP
	option, as defined in <xref target="RFC6334"></xref>.
	Multiple IP addresses can be configured for the FQDN of an
	AFTR on the DNS server. If a B4 element detects a failure on
	the link to the AFTR, the B4 element MUST terminate the
	current DS-Lite tunnel, choose another AFTR address in the
	list, and create a tunnel to the new AFTR. If necessary, the
	B4 element SHOULD re-configure the connectivity test tool
	accordingly and restart the test procedures.
      </t>
      <t>
	Anycasts may also be used for failover. But there is an
        ICMP-error-message problem with anycast, that is, when a
        packet is sent from the AFTR to a B4 element, if one of the
        routers along the path generates an ICMP error message, e.g.,
        Packet Too Big (PTB), then the error message may not be sent
        back to the source AFTR but to another AFTR.

	In the <xref target="RFC6333">DS-Lite</xref> application, the
