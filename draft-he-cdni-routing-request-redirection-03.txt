          Routing Request Redirection for CDN Interconnection
              draft-he-cdni-routing-request-redirection-03

Abstract

   The Request Routing Interface comprises of (1) the asynchronous
   advertisement of footprint and capabilities by a downstream CDN that
   allows a upstream CDN to decide whether to redirect particular user
   requests to that downstream CDN; and (2) the synchronous operation of
   an upstream CDN requesting whether a downstream CDN is prepared to
   accept a user request and of a downstream CDN responding with how to
   actually redirect the user request.  This document describes an
   interface for the latter part, i.e. the CDNI Request Routing
   Redirection interface.

Internet-Draft         Routing Request Redirection          October 2012


1.  Introduction

   A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a system built on an existing IP
   network which is used for large scale content delivery, via
   prefetching or dynamically caching content on its distributed
   surrogates (caching servers) that are typically deployed close to the
   end users so that a CDN can improve access to the content it caches,
   for example, by reducing access latency and improving the end user
   experience.

   In recent years the volume of video and multimedia content delivered
   over the internet is rapidly increasing.  To accommodate this
   increase, existing CDN providers are scaling up their infrastructure
   and many Network Service Providers (NSPs) are deploying their own
   CDNs.  Another emerging requirement is CDN Interconnection (CDNI).

   Several real world use cases are described in
   [I-D.ietf-cdni-use-cases] which prove the necessity for CDN
   interconnection.  The most frequently mentioned use case is
   leveraging the collective CDN footprint of interconnected standalone
   CDNs to achieve the goal of delivering content to additional
   distributed end users regardless of their location.

   [I-D.ietf-cdni-problem-statement] describes the problem area, where
   CDNs are interconnected as described in [I-D.ietf-cdni-use-cases]
   based on the requirements described in [I-D.ietf-cdni-requirements],
   and using the technology framework described in
   [I-D.ietf-cdni-framework].

   The purpose of this document is to define the interface for
   synchronous redirection operation of the request routing interface,
   which is one of the main building blocks of the CDN interconnection
   architecture described in [I-D.ietf-cdni-requirements].


2.  Terminology

   [I-D.ietf-cdni-problem-statement].  The term "Distinguished CDN
   Domain" defined in [I-D.ietf-cdni-framework] is also reused in this

Internet-Draft         Routing Request Redirection          October 2012


   DNS Redirection: The act of using DNS name resolution for the request
   routing process of a CDN.  In DNS Redirection, the DNS resolver of
   the CDN makes the routing decision based on a local policy and
   returns the result as the response of a DNS query request to redirect
   a user agent to a new target.  In CDNI, the result may point to a
   surrogate of the CDN, a request router in a downstream CDN or a
   surrogate in a downstream CDN, etc.

   HTTP Redirection: The act of using an HTTP redirection response to
   redirect a user agent to a new target.  The new target is the result
   of the routing decision of a CDN at the time it receives a content
   request via HTTP.  In CDNI, the result may point to a surrogate of
   the CDN, a request router in a downstream CDN or a surrogate in a
   downstream CDN etc.


3.  Interface function and operation overview

   [[Editor's note: How an upsteam CDN decides which downstream CDN(s)
   to query is a local policy within the upstream CDN and is outside the
   scope of this document.]]

   The CDNI Request Routing Redirection interface (CDNI RRRI) is one of
   the main building blocks required in order to interconnect CDNs.  The
   main function of the Request Routing interface is to allow the
   Request Routing systems in interconnected CDNs to communicate to
   facilitate the redirection of User Agent requests between
   interconnected CDNs.

   The detailed requirements for the CDNI Request Routing Redirection
   interface and their relative priorities of those requirements are
   described in section 5 of [I-D.ietf-cdni-requirements].

   The CDNI Request Routing Redirection interface operates between a
   pair of interconnected CDNs.  To enable communication over the CDNI
   Request Routing Redirection interface, the two interconnected CDNs
   need to know the end point (URI) in the other CDN to query.  For
   example, an Upstream CDN needs to know the URI (end point) in a
   Downstream CDN to send its CDNI Request Routing queries to.

   The CDNI Request Routing Redirection interface URI may be statically
   pre-configured, dynamically discovered via the CDNI control
   interface, or discovered via other means.  However, such discovery
   mechanisms are not specified in this document, as they are considered
   out of the scope of the CDNI Request Routing Redirection interface
   specification.

   CDNI solutions must support both of the request routing mechanisms

   illustrated in section 2.1 of [I-D.ietf-cdni-framework], namely
   Iterative Request Routing and Recursive Request Routing.  However,
   the Iterative Request Routing method does not invoke any interaction
   over the request routing redirection interface across interconnected
   CDNs.  Therefore, the Request Routing Redirection interface is only
   relevant in the case of Recursive Request Routing and so this
   document will not discuss Iterative Request Routing further.

   In the case of Recursive Request Routing, an Upstream CDN forwards a
   CDNI request routing request from a user agent to a Downstream CDN
   for surrogate selection.  The initial Upstream CDN->User Agent
   redirection protocols addressed in this draft are: DNS redirection
   and HTTP redirection.  Moreover, the internal routing mechanisms used
   between the CDN and the user agent (DNS and HTTP Redirection) of the
   two interconnected CDNs should also be taken into account as they may
   affect the type of query request the Upstream CDN send to a
   Downstream CDN and the information the Downstream CDNs return in its
   query response.

3.1.  Discussion on protocol type for CDNI RRRI

   The request routing process between an Upstream CDN and a Downstream
   CDN has several variants depending on the following factors:

   o  Which request routing mechanism is being used by an Upstream CDN
      to redirect the User Agent: DNS Redirection or HTTP Redirection.

   o  Which request routing mechanism is being used by a Downstream CDN
      to redirect the User Agent: DNS Redirection or HTTP Redirection.

   The possible combinations are shown in Table 1.

4.  Data passed in CDNI request routing redirection requests & responses

   To assist the routing decision of a Downstream CDN, the Upstream CDN
   shall convey as much information as possible to the Downstream CDN,
   e.g.  URI of the requested content, the client's location
   information.

   In addition to details of the User Agent's request to the Upstream
   CDN, the Downstream CDN requires the appropriate CDNI metadata or
   policies related to the content the User Agent is requesting in order
   for the Downstream CDN to determine whether it is capable of
   delivering any requested content in the manner specified by the CDNI
   Metadata associated with that content.  For example, the Downstream
   CDN needs to verify that the delivery protocol that will be used is a
   delivery protocol that the Downstream CDN supports.

   Similarly, in addition to details of how to redirect the User Agent,
   the Downstream CDN may wish to return additional policy to the
   Upstream CDN to help the Upstream CDN with future CDNI RRRI requests.
   For example the Downstream CDN may wish to return a policy that
   expresses "this response can be reused without requiring a RRRI
   request for 60 seconds provided the User Agent's IP address is in the
   range 192.0.2.0 - 192.0.2.255".

   The information passed in CDNI request routing redirection requests
   splits into two basic categories:

   1.  An encapsulation of the User Agent's request to the upstream CDN.

   2.  Properties/parameters that the uCDN can use to control the dCDN's
       response or that can help the dCDN make its decision.

   The information passed in CDNI request routing redirection response
   splits into two basic categories:

   1.  An encapsulation of the DNS response or HTTP response to return
       to the End User.

   2.  parameters /policies that indicate the properties of the
       response, such as, whether it is cacheable, the scope of the
       response, etc.

   The following sections provide more detailed descriptions of the
   information that should be passed in CDNI request routing redirection
   interface requests and responses for both DNS redirection and HTTP
   redirection mechanisms.

4.1.  Data passed in CDNI RRRI requests & response for DNS redirection

   [[Editor's Note: Align the terminology in this section with standards
   DNS terminology.]]

   For DNS based redirection the uCDN needs to pass the following
   information to the dCDN in the CDNI RRRI request:

   o  The IP address of the DNS resolver that made the DNS request to
      the Upstream CDN.

   o  The type of DNS query made (A, AAAA, etc.).

   o  The host/domain for which DNS redirection is being requested.

   o  The IP address of the User Agent (if known to the Upstream CDN,
      e.g. through edns-client-subnet).

   For DNS redirection, the uCDN also needs to provide in the CDNI RRRI
   request the a link to the associated CDNI Metadata for the host/
   domain being requested.

   The information passed in CDNI request routing redirection requests
   are enumerated in the sections below, which covers both DNS
   redirection and HTTP redirection.

   For DNS based redirection the dCDN needs to return one of the
   following to the uCDN in the CDNI RRRI response:

Internet-Draft         Routing Request Redirection          October 2012


   o  The IP address of the selected Surrogate in the dCDN (if the dCDN
      is performing DNS based redirection); or

   o  The IP address of a Request Router in the dCDN (if the dCDN is
      performing HTTP based redirection).

   In addition, the dCDN could also include the following information in
   its response:

   o  An indication of the cacheability of the response (to reduce the
      number of subsequent CDNI RRI requests the uCDN needs to make).

   o  The scope of the response (if it is cacheable).  For example
      whether the response applies to a wider range of IP addresses than
      what was included in the CDNI RRRI request.

4.2.  Data passed in CDNI RRRI request & responses for HTTP redirection

   For HTTP based redirection the uCDN needs to pass the following
   information to the dCDN in the CDNI RRRI request:

   o  The IP address of the User Agent.

   o  The URL requested by the User Agent.

   For HTTP redirection, the uCDN also needs to provide in the CDNI RRRI
   request the a link to the associated CDNI Metadata for the host/
   domain being requested and whether the uCDN would like the dCDN to
   return the IP address or the hostname of the surrogate in the
   returned redirection URL.

   [[Editor's note: An alternative would be to have the RRRI response
   always contain both hostnames & IP addresses and just let the uCDN
   pick which one it want to return to the User Agent]]

   For HTTP based redirection the dCDN needs to return one of the
   following to the uCDN in the CDNI RRRI response:

   o  A URL pointing to the selected Surrogate in the dCDN (if the dCDN
      is redirecting the User Agent directly to a surrogate); or

   o  A URL pointing to a Request Router in the dCDN (if the dCDN is not
      redirecting the User Agent directly to a surrogate).

   In addition, the dCDN could also include the following information in
   its response:

Internet-Draft         Routing Request Redirection          October 2012


   o  An indication of the cacheability of the response (to reduce the
      number of subsequent CDNI RRI requests the uCDN needs to make).

   o  The scope of the response (if it is cacheable).  For example
      whether the response applies to a wider range of IP addresses than
      what was included in the CDNI RRRI request.


5.  HTTP based RESTful interface for CDNI Request Routing Redirection

   This document defines a simple HTTP based RESTful interface for the
   CDNI Request Routing Redirection interface, where End User's requests
   are encapsulated along with links to appropriate CDNI Metadata
   resources (records) and any other data that can aid the downstream
   CDN in processing the requests.  The RRI response encapsulates the
   response that the upstream CDN should return to the End User (if it
   decides to utilize the Downstream CDN for delivery) along with the
   policy for how the response could be reused (through standard HTTP
   Cache-Control headers).

   The same RESTful interface is used for both DNS and HTTP redirection
   of User Agent's requests, although the contents of the CDNI RRRI
   requests/responses contain data specific to either DNS or HTTP
   redirection.

   This approach has been chosen because it enables CDN operators to
   only have to deploy a single (RESTful) interface for request routing
   between their CDNs, regardless of the User Agent redirection method.
   In this way, from an operational point of view there is only one
   interface to monitor, manage, develop troubleshooting tools for, etc.

   In addition, having a single CDNI Request Routing interface where the
   User Agent's DNS or HTTP request are encapsulated along with the
   other data required for the downstream CDN to make a request routing
   decision, avoids having to try and encapsulate or proxy DNS/HTTP/
   RTMP/etc requests and find ways to somehow embed the additional CDNI
   Request Routing properties/data within those End User DNS/HTTP/RTMP/
   etc requests.

   Finally, the interface is easily extendable to support other User
   Agent request redirection methods (e.g.  RTMP 302 redirection).

   The general call flow between Request Routers in a pair of
   interconnected CDNs is as follows:

   1.  The User Agent sends its request, either DNS request or HTTP
       request etc., to CDN A. The Request Routing System of CDN A
       processes the request, and it recognizes that the request is best
       served by another CDN, specifically CDN B (or that CDN B is one
       of a number of candiodate dCDNs it could use).

   2.  The Request Routing System of CDN A sends an HTTP POST to CDN B's
       CDNI Request Routing Interface URI encapsulating the User Agent's
       request, as well as a link to the associated CDNI metadata, etc.,
       which may help CDN B make its decision when processing the
       request.

   3.  The Request Routing System of CDN B processes the request and
       assuming the request is well formed, etc. responds with an HTTP
       "200" response with a mesage body containing an encapsulation of
       the protocol specific response to return to the User Agent (e.g.,
       for HTTP redirection the URI that CDN A needs to return in a 302
       response to the User Agent) as well as parameters that indicate
       the properties of the response (e.g., parameter that indicates if
       the response applies to a wider range of IP addresses than the
       single IP address being used by the User Agent).

   4.  The Request Routing System of CDN B sends the protocol specific
       response to the User Agent, and then the User Agent's request
       will be redirected to the CDN B.

6.  Protocol Specification

   This section only specifies a brief introduction of different fields
   to be exchanged in CDNI Request Routing Redirection requests/
   responses, and the specific encoding for them will be presented in a
   future revision.

   [[Editor's note: This section needs some re-work, which we should do
   as part of documenting the specific protocol details.]]

6.1.  Recursive Request Routing

   Upon receiving a DNS query request from a User Agent, the Request
   Routing System of the Upstream CDN firsts determines how it should
   redirect the request using local policy.  If it is aware that the End
   User is best served by another CDN, the Upstream CDN may make a CDNI
   RRRI request (that encapsulates the User Agent's request) to that
   Downstream CDN.

   Upon receiving a response from the Downstream CDN, if the Request
   Routing System of the Upstream CDN decides to use that Downstream
   CDN, the Upstream CDN redirects the User Agent to the downstream CDN
   using the information in the CDNI RRRI response.

6.1.1.  Downstream CDN Behavior for DNS based User Agent requests

   Upon receiving a CDNI RRRI request, the Downstream CDN extracts End
   User's request information (e.g., the content provider's domain name)
   as well as associated CDNI Metadata to help it process the request.
   It then determines how it should redirect the request using local
   policy.

   If the dCDN decides to use DNS Redirection, where the Downstream CDN
   is redirecting directly to a surrogate in the Downstream CDN: the
   Downstream CDN selects one or more surrogates and returns a CDNI RRRI
   response containing the IP addresses of the selected surrogate(s), as
   well as parameters/policies that indicate the properties of the
   response, such as, parameter that indicate whether the response is
   cacheable and for how long, parameter that indicate the scope of the
   response (if it is cacheable), etc.

   If the dCDN decides to use DNS Redirection, where the Downstream CDN
   is redirecting to a Request Router in the dCDN: the Downstream CDN
   returns a CDNI RRRI response containing a CNAME of the Downstream
   CDN's Request Router(s), as well as parameters/policies that indicate
   the properties of the response, such as, parameter that indicate
   whether the response is cacheable and for how long, parameter that
   indicate the scope of the response (if it is cacheable), etc.

Internet-Draft         Routing Request Redirection          October 2012


   If the dCDN decides to use HTTP Redirection, where the original User
   Agent request was via DNS: the Downstream CDN returns a CDNI RRRI
   response containing the IP address of the Downstream CDN's Request
   Router(s), as well as parameters/policies that indicate the
   properties of the response, such as, parameter that indicate whether
   the response is cacheable and for how long, parameter that indicate
   the scope of the response (if it is cacheable), etc.

6.1.2.  Downstream CDN Behavior for HTTP based User Agent requests

   Upon receiving a CDNI RRRI request, the Downstream CDN extracts End
   User's request information (e.g., the content provider's domain name)
   as well as associated CDNI Metadata to help it process the request.
   It then determines how it should redirect the request using local
   policy.

   The Downstream CDN selects one or more surrogates and returns a CDNI
   RRRI response containing a URL including the hostname and/or IP
   addresses of the selected surrogate(s), as well a path component that
   will return the resource originally request by the End User's User
   Agent.  The CDNI RRRI response should also include parameters/
   policies that indicate the properties of the response, such as,
   parameter that indicate whether the response is cacheable and for how
   long, parameter that indicate the scope of the response (if it is
   cacheable), etc.

6.1.3.  Example CDNI RRRI Requests/Responses

   [[Editors' Note: Explanation of the format of the CDNI RRRI requests/
   responses is given as comments marked '#'.  Need to extract & place
   in their own section which specifies the structure of CDNI RRRI
   requests/responses]]

6.2.  Iterative Request Routing

   [[Editor's note: Currently Iterative Request Routing is out of scope
   for this document as it does not require use of the CDNI RRRI.  This
   section is just included to show that the authors' have not
   overlooked Iterative Request Routing.]]


7.  Security Considerations

   [[Editor's note: Not sure if this current text is really security
   considerations or whether it is better placed elsewhere in the
   document.]]

   In HTTP based Recursive Request Routing, the end user's web browsers
   will not send cookies if the content request is redirected to a URL
   in a different domain rather than the original CP's domain, e.g. the
   Downstream CDN's domain.  If the browser is expected to send any
   cookies associated with the original CP's domain, this will cause
   problem that the CP's policy is not enforced by the CDN.

   The section 5.2 of draft [I-D.peterson-cdni-strawman] has discussed a
   similar question and given a solution.
