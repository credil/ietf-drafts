      Handing Over Child SAs Following Re-Authentication in IKEv2
                       draft-nir-ipsecme-cafr-01

Abstract

   This document describes an extension to the IKEv2 protocol whereby
   Child SAs are moved to the new IKE SA following re-authentication.
   This allows for a smoother transition with no loss of connectivity.

Internet-Draft       child adoption following reauth         August 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol, as specified in
   [RFC5996bis] associates Child SAs with the IKE SAs under which the
   exchange that created them took place.  With the deletion of the IKE
   SA due to expiry, policy change, or an explicit message from the
   peer, the child SAs associated with it are implicitly closed as
   described in section 1.4.1 of the IKEv2 document.  This behavior is
   not desired when IKE SAs are replaced rather than deleted, because
   those child SAs could still be valid and there is no security reason
   to create new ones prematurely.

   There are two cases where an IKE SA is replaced.
   1.  Rekeying, where new keys are generated.  This is described in
       section 2.18 of RFC 5996.  This is done mainly for key freshness.
   2.  Re-Authentication, where both sides authenticate, and new keys
       are generated.  This is done as part of a risk management policy,
       to limit the time that compromised IKE SA keys can be used to
       provide the attacker access to the network.  No reauthentication
       exchange is specified in the RFC.  Instead, it's simply the
       Initial and Authentication exchanges done as if from scratch.
       This is described in section 2.8.3 of RFC 5996.

   For rekeying, RFC 5996 provides a way to avoid having to re-create
   all child SAs.  When an IKE SA is rekeyed, all the Child SAs under
   the old IKE SA are inherited by the new IKE SA, so that the
   subsequent deletion of the old IKE SA does not affect the Child SAs.
   This behavior is described in section 2.8 paragraph 4 of RFC 5996.

   For reauthentication, RFC 5996 does not provide a similar mechanism,
   and section 2.8.3 explicitly says that Child SAs need to be created
   from scratch.  This is often inconvenient, as IPsec systems usually
   create Child SAs only in response to traffic and multiple Child SAs
   may exist for a single IKE SA.  The protocol extension in this draft
   closes this gap.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terms IKE SA, Child SA, Rekeying, and Reauthentication are as
   described in the RFC 5996.

2.  Handing Over Child SAs

   This document defines a new notification that can be sent over an old
   IKE SA, just after an IKE_AUTH exchange has been used to re-
   authenticate.  The notification tells the peer to transfer all Child
   SAs that belong to the current (old) IKE SA to be owned by the new
   IKE SA, so that when the old IKE SA is deleted, those Child SAs are
   not.  If both peers send this notification, all Child SAs belonging
   to the old IKE SA are immediately inherited by the new IKE SA.

   In addition to the Child SAs, any IP address assigned to either peer
   through the use of the CFG payload (as described in section 2.19 of
   RFC 5996), is also associated with the new IKE SA.

   The new notification MAY be accompanied by a DELETE payload, so as to
   transfer the Child SAs and delete the old IKE SA at the same time.

2.1.  The HAND_OVER_CHILD_SAS Notification

   The HAND_OVER_CHILD_SA notification is formatted as follows:

                            1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       ! Next Payload  !C!  RESERVED   !         Payload Length        !
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       !  Protocol ID  !   SPI Size    !  HAND_OVER_CHILD_SAS Type     !
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                                                               |
       ~                Security Parameter Index (SPI)                 ~
       |                                                               |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                                     Figure 1

   o  Protocol ID (1 octet) MUST be 1, denoting an IKE SA.  Note that
      previous versions of RFC 5996 explicitly mentioned the
      possibility, but the current version omits this as prior to this
      specification there were no cases where the value 1 should have
      been used.
   o  SPI Size (1 octet) MUST be 16, as that is the size of the
      concatenation of the IKE SPIs.
   o  Security Parameter Index (16 octets) - contains the concatenated
      SPIs of the old IKE SA.  The Initiator SPI comes first, similar to
      the first 16 bytes of the IKE header.
   o  HAND_OVER_CHILD_SAS Notify Message Type (2 octets) - MUST be
      xxxxx, the value assigned for HAND_OVER_CHILD_SAS.  TBA by IANA.

2.2.  Verifying the HAND_OVER_CHILD_SAS Notification

   To go through with the new IKE SA inheriting the SAs of the old IKE
   SA, all of the following MUST apply:
   o  Both sides have to be successfully authenticated, and the new IKE
      SA has to be established.
   o  The authenticated identities of both sides under the new IKE SA
      are the same as those under the old IKE SA.  If the authenticated
      identity of one peer differs from the authenticated identity that
      it had in the previous IKE SA, the other side MUST respond with an
      INVALID_SYNTAX notification.

   If either of the above conditions does not apply, a conformant
   implementation MUST NOT send the HAND_OVER_CHILD_SAS Notification.
   Additionally, an implementation MUST NOT hand over the child SAs if
   the other side has not sent the notification, and MUST hand them over
   if both it and the other side had sent the notification.


3.  The Illustrated Protocol

   The Informational exchange after creating a new IKE SA:

      Initiator                                   Responder
      -----------------------------------------------------------------
      HDR, SK {
               N(HAND_OVER_IKE_SAS, new IKE SA SPIs),
               DELETE
              }              -->
                                                  HDR, SK {
                                 N(HAND_OVER_IKE_SAS, new IKE SA SPIs)
                             <--                          }

                                     Figure 2


   Note that in the above figure, the HDR has the IKE SPIs of the old
   IKE SAs, and the SK payload uses the keys of the old IKE SA, because
   this message is sent over the old IKE SA.


4.  Interaction with Other Standards

   This document changes things so that there is often no need to create
   new Child SAs along with the new IKE SA when reauthenticating.  This
   makes the full IKE_AUTH exchange with the piggy-backed Child SA
   exchange (as described in RFC 5996) superfluous.  Implementations
   should consider implementing the childless extension of IKEv2

   ([RFC6023]) in addition to this specification.


5.  Acknowledgements

   The author would like to thank Valery Smyslov for the suggestion of
   moving the hand-over from the IKE_AUTH to an Informational under the
   old IKE SA.  This changed (in version -01) simplified the protocol
   significantly.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a notify message type from the status
   types range (16418-40959) of the "IKEv2 Notify Message Types"
   registry with name "HAND_OVER_CHILD_SAS"


7.  Security Considerations

   The HAND_OVER_CHILD_SAS notification is sent protected by the old IKE
   SA.  This protects against stealing child SAs.  The requirement for
   sameness of authenticated identity protects against errors by one
   peer transferring child SAs to some other peer, although we cannot
   think of any attack that would exploit this.


8.  Changes from Previous Versions

   [NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: PLEASE REMOVE THIS SECTION]

   Version -01 moved the sending of the notification from the IKE_AUTH
   exchange that is part of reauthentication to the Informational
   exchange that is part of closing the old IKE SA.  This made
   cryptographic binding to the old IKE SA unnecessary.
