      <t>This memo proposes a new Remote Authentication Dial In User Service
      (RADIUS) attribute to carry the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of a
      Port Control Protocol (PCP) server, such that while the PCP server
      information is configured on a RADIUS server, the information can be
      conveyed to Network Access Server (NAS) via RADIUS protocol, and the
      co-located Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP/DHCPv6) server can
      then populate the information to PCP client.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>Port Control Protocol (PCP) <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcp-base"></xref>
      provides a mechanism to control how incoming packets are forwarded by
      upstream devices such as NATs and firewalls. PCP is a client-server
      protocol where a PCP client may reside on a host, a Customer Premises
      Equipment (CPE), etc., which communicates with a PCP server that may
      reside anywhere in a network.</t>

      <t>A PCP client must know the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of a
      PCP server, before it can communicate with the later in order to perform
      the relevant PCP functions.</t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp"></xref> defines DHCPv6 and DHCP
      options which are meant to be used by a PCP client to discover a PCP
      server name. However, provisioning for name of the PCP server is
      required on a DHCP/DHCPv6 server before it can populate these
      information.</t>

      <t>Auto-configuration on a DHCP/DHCPv6 is possible in a broadband
      network, where typically, user profile is maintained on a Remote
      Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) server and RADIUS protocol
      <xref target="RFC2865"></xref> is used to convey user related
      information to other network elements including a host and CPE. <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-radext-ipv6-access"></xref> describes a typical
      broadband network scenario in which the Network Access Server (NAS) acts
      as the access gateway for the users (hosts or CPEs) and the NAS embeds a
      DHCPv6 Server function that allows it to locally handle any DHCPv6
      requests issued by the clients.</t>

      <t>In such environment, PCP server&rsquo;s name can be configured on a
      RADIUS server, which then passes the information to a NAS that
      co-locates with the DHCP/DHCPv6 server, which in turn populates the
      location of the PCP server.</t>

      <t>This memo defines a new RADIUS attribute that can be used to carry
      the FQDN of a PCP server.</t>

      <t>The approach described above is already used for providing the FQDN
      of the AFTR in the DS-Lite scenario and the equivalent RADIUS attribute
      for the DS-Lite Tunnel Name is defined <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-radius-ext"></xref>.</t>

    <section title="PCP Server Configuration using RADIUS and DHCP/DHCPv6 ">
      <t><xref target="fig1"></xref> illustrates how RADIUS protocol works
      together with DHCPv6, to allow a host to learn automatically the FQDN of
      a PCP server in case of a PPP session that carries IPv6 traffic.</t>

      <t>The Network Access Server (NAS) operates as a client of RADIUS and
      co-locates with a DHCPv6 Server for DHCPv6 protocol. The NAS initially
      sends a RADIUS Access Request message to the RADIUS server, requesting
      authentication. Once the RADIUS server receives the request, it
      validates the sending client and if the request is approved, the RADIUS
      server replies with an Access Accept message including a list of
      attribute-value pairs that describe the parameters to be used for this
      session. This list MAY also contain the name of a PCP server. When the
      co-located DHCPv6 server receives a DHCPv6 message containing the PCP
      Server Option, it SHALL use the name returned in the RADIUS attribute as
      defined in this memo to populate the DHCPv6 PCP Server option defined in
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp"></xref></t>

      <t>The <xref target="fig2"></xref> illustrates how the RADIUS protocol
      and DHCPv6 work together to accomplish PCP client configuration when
      DHCPv6 is used to provide connectivity to the user.</t>

      <t>The difference between this message flow and previous one is that in
      this scenario the interaction between NAS and AAA/ RADIUS Server is
      triggered by the DHCPv6 Solicit message received by the NAS from the B4
      acting as DHCPv6 client, while in case of a PPP Session the trigger is
      the PPP LCP Config Request message received by the NAS.</t>

      <t>After receiving the PCP server name in the initial Access-Accept the
      NAS MUST store the received PCP Server Name locally. When the PCP Client
      sends a DHCP message to request an extension of the lifetimes for the
      assigned address or prefix, the NAS does not have to initiate a new
      Access-Request towards the AAA server to request the PCP server name.
      The NAS retrieves the previously stored PCP Server name and uses it in
      its reply.</t>

      <t>If the DHCP server to which the DHCP Renew message was sent at time
      T1 has not responded, the DHCP client initiates a Rebind/Reply exchange
      with any available server. In this scenario the NAS MUST initiate a new
      Access-Request towards the AAA server, after the co-located DHCP server
      receives the DHCP message. The NAS MAY include the PCP Server Name
      attribute in its Access-Request.</t>

      <t>If the NAS does not receive the PCP server name attribute in the
      Access-Accept it MAY fallback to a pre-configured default tunnel name,
      if any. If the NAS does not have any pre-configured default tunnel name
      or if the NAS receives an Access-Reject, the PCP client can not be
      configured by the NAS.</t>

      <t>The scenario with PPP Session and IPv4 only connectivity does not
      require the DHCP protocol: the whole configuration of the client is
      performed by PPP. This case is out of scope of this document because in
      order to complete the configuration of the PCP client a new PPP IPC
      option would be required.</t>

    <section anchor="Attrib" title="RADIUS Attribute">
      <t>A new RADIUS attribute, called PCP-Server-Name, along with its format
      is defined below.</t>

      <t>Description</t>

      <t>The PCP-server-name attribute contains a Fully Qualified Domain Name
      (FQDN) that refers to a PCP server the client requests to establish a
      connection to for PCP related service. The NAS shall use the name
      returned in the RADIUS PCP-server-name attribute to populate the PCP
      Server FQDN DHCP Sub-Option in IPv4 addressing context, or the PCP
      Server FQDN DHCPv6 Option in IPv6 addressing context, as determined by
      the DHCP server <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp"></xref></t>

      <t>The PCP-server-name attribute MAY appear in an Access-Accept packet.
      This attribute MAY be used in Access-Request packets as a hint to the
      RADIUS server; for example if the NAS is pre-configured with a default
      PCP server name, this name MAY be inserted in the attribute. The RADIUS
      server MAY ignore the hint sent by the NAS and it MAY assign a different
      PCP Server name. If the NAS includes the PCP Server Name attribute, but
      the AAA server does not recognize it, this attribute MUST be ignored by
      the AAA Server. If the NAS does not receive PCP Server Name attribute in
      the Access-Accept it MAY fallback to a pre-configured default PCP server
      name, if any. If the NAS is pre-provisioned with a default PCP server
      name and the PCP server name received in Access-Accept is different from
      the configured default, then the PCP server name received in the Access-
      Accept message MUST be used for the session.</t>

      <t>The PCP server Name RADIUS attribute MAY be present in
      Accounting-Request records where the Acct-Status-Type is set to Start,
      Stop or Interim-Update. The PCP Server Name RADIUS attribute MUST NOT
      appear more than once in a message.</t>

      <t>A summary of the PCP-Server-Name RADIUS attribute format is shown
      below. The fields are transmitted from left to right.</t>
