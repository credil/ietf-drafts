     <t>Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is an IP/TCP mechanism where network nodes 
     can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to indicate congestion to the end-points. 
     An ECN-capable receiver will feedback this information to the sender. ECN is specified for
     TCP in such a way that only one feedback signal can be transmitted per Round-Trip Time (RTT).
     Recently, new TCP mechanisms like ConEx or DCTCP need more accurate ECN feedback information in the case 
     where more than one marking is received in one RTT. 
     This documents specifies requirement for different ECN feedback scheme in the TCP header 
     to provide more than one feedback signal per RTT.

   <section title="Introduction">
   <t>Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) <xref target="RFC3168"/> is 
	   an IP/TCP mechanism where
	   network nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to indicate congestion to
	   the end-points. An ECN-capable receiver will feedback this information to the sender.
	   ECN is specified for TCP in such a way that only one feedback signal can be
	   transmitted per Round-Trip Time (RTT).
	   Recently, proposed mechanisms like Congestion Exposure (ConEx) or DCTCP 
	   <xref target="Ali10"/> need more accurate ECN feedback information 
	   in case when more than one marking is received in one RTT. 
     </t>
     <t> The following scenarios should briefly show where the accurate feedback 
	     is needed or provides additional value:
	     <list hangIndent="8" style="hanging">
	     <t hangText="A Standard (RFC5681) TCP sender that supports ConEx:"><vspace/>
		     In this case the congestion control algorithm still ignores multiple 
		     marks per RTT, while the ConEx mechanism uses the extra information 
		     per RTT to re-echo more precise congestion information. </t>
	     <t hangText="A sender using DCTCP congestion control without ConEx:"><vspace/>
		     The congestion control algorithm uses the extra info per RTT to 
		     perform its decrease depending on the number of congestion marks.</t>
	     <t hangText="A sender using DCTCP congestion control and supports ConEx:"><vspace/>
		     Both the congestion control algorithm and ConEx use the accurate 
		     ECN feedback mechanism.</t>
	     <t hangText="A standard TCP sender (using RFC5681 congestion control algorithm) without ConEx:"><vspace/>
		     No accurate feedback is necessary here. The congestion control 
		     algorithm still react only on one signal per RTT. But it is best 
		     to have one generic feedback mechanism, whether it is used or not.</t>

     <section title="Overview ECN and ECN Nonce in IP/TCP">
       <t>ECN requires two bits in the IP header. The ECN capability of a 
         packet is indicated when either one of the two bits is set. An 
         ECN sender can set one or the other bit to indicate 
         an ECN-capable transport (ECT) which results in two signals, 
         ECT(0) and ECT(1). A network node can set both bits simultaneously 
         when it experiences congestion. When both bits are set the 
         packet is regarded as "Congestion Experienced" (CE).
	     </t>
		     
	     <t>In the TCP header the first two bits in byte 14 are defined 
       	for the use of ECN. The TCP mechanism for signaling the reception 
       	of a congestion mark uses the ECN-Echo (ECE) flag in the TCP header. 
       	To enable the TCP receiver to determine when to stop setting the 
       	ECN-Echo flag, the CWR flag is set by the sender upon reception of 
       	the feedback signal. This leads always to a full RTT of ACKs with 
       	ECE set. Thus any additional CE markings arriving within this RTT 
       	can not signaled back anymore. 
	     </t>
	     <t>
         ECN-Nonce <xref target="RFC3540"/> is an optional addition to ECN 
         that is used to protect the TCP sender against accidental or 
         malicious concealment of marked or dropped packets. This addition 
         defines the last bit of byte 13 in the TCP header as the Nonce 
         Sum (NS) bit. With ECN-Nonce a nonce sum is maintain that counts 
         the occurrence of ECT(1) packets.

     <section title="Requirements">
     <t>The requirements of the accurate ECN feedback protocol for the use of 
     	 e.g. Conex or DCTCP are to have a fairly accurate (not necessarily 
     	 perfect), timely and protected signaling. This leads to the following 
     	 requirements:</t>
     
     <t><list hangIndent="8" style="hanging">
     <t hangText="Resilience"><vspace/>The ECN feedback signal is carried within the 
     TCP acknowledgment. TCP ACKs can get lost. Moreover, delayed ACK are mostly used 
     with TCP. That means in most cases only every second data packets triggers an ACK. 
     In a high congestion situation where most of the packet are marked with CE, an 
     accurate feedback mechanism must still be able to signal sufficient congestion 
     information. Thus the accurate ECN feedback extension has to take delayed ACK and 
     ACK loss into account.</t>
     
     <t hangText="Timely"><vspace/>The CE marking is induced by a network node on the 
     transmission path and echoed by the receiver in the TCP acknowledgment. Thus when 
     this information arrives at the sender, its naturally already about one RTT old. 
     With a sufficient ACK rate a further delay of a small number of ACK can be 
     tolerated but with large delays this information will be out dated due to high 
     dynamic in the network. TCP congestion control which introduces parts of these 
     dynamics operates on a time scale of one RTT. Thus the congestion feedback 
     information should be delivered timely (within one RTT).</t>
     
     <t hangText="Integrity"><vspace/>With ECN Nonce, a misbehaving receiver or network node 
       can be detected with a certain probability. As this accurate ECN feedback is 
       reusing the NS bit, it is encouraged to ensure integrity as least as good as 
       ECN Nonce. If this is not possible, alternative approaches should be provided 
       how a mechanism using the accurate ECN feedback extension can re-ensure 
       integrity or give strong incentives for the receiver and network node to 
       cooperate honestly. <!--If and what kind of 
     enforcements a sender should do, when detecting wrong feedback information, is 
     out-of-scope.--></t>
     
     <t hangText="Accuracy"><vspace/><!--In TCP usually delayed ACKs are used. Thats means in 
     most cases only for every second data packets an acknowledgment is sent. Moreover, 
     an ACK can get lost.-->Classic ECN feeds back one congestion notification per RTT, as 
     this is supposed to be used for TCP congestion control which reduces the sending 
     rate at most once per RTT. The accurate ECN feedback scheme has to ensure that 
     if a congestion events occurs at least one congestion notification is echoed and 
     received per RTT as classic ECN would do. Of course, the goal of this extension is to 
     reconstruct the number of CE marking more accurately. However, a sender should 
     not assume to get the exact number of congestion marking in all situations.</t>
     
     <t hangText="Complexity"><vspace/>Of course, the more accurate ECN feedback can 
       also be used, even if only one ECN feedback signal per RTT is need. The 
       implementation should be as simple as possible and only a minimum of addition 
       state information should be needed. A proposal fulfilling this for a more
       accurate ECN feedback can then also be the standard ECN feedback mechanism.</t>
     </list></t>
     </section>
     
     <section title="Design Approaches">
	<section title="Re-use of Header Bits">
     <t>The idea is to use the ECE, CWR and NS bits for additional 
       capability negotiation during the TCP handshake exchange, and 
       then for the more accurate ECN feedback itself on subsequent packets in the 
       flow (where SYN is not set). This appraoch only provide a limited resiliency 
       against ACK lost.
     </t>
     <t>There have been several codings proposed so far: The one bit scheme sends one ECE 
	     for each CE received (+ redundancy in next ACK using the CWR bit). The 3 bit
	     counter scheme uses all three bits for continuesly feeding the three most
	     significant bits of a CE counter back. 
	     The 3 bit codepoint scheme encodes either a CE
	     counter or an ECT(1) counter in 8 codepoints.
     </t>
     <t>Discussion on ACK loss and ECN...</t>
     <t>ToDo: Use of other header bit?
     </t>
        </section>
	<section title="Use of Reserved Bits ">
	<t>As seen in <xref target="TCPHdr"/>, there are currently three unused flag bits
	in the TCP header. The proposed scheme could be extended by one or
	more bits, to add higher resiliency against ACK loss. The relative gain 
	would be proportionally higher resiliency against ACK loss, while the respective 
     	drawbacks would remain identical.</t>
	</section>
	<section title="TCP Option">
     <t>Alternatively, a new TCP option could be introduced, to help maintain the 
       accuracy, and integrity of the ECN feedback between receiver and sender. 
       Such an option could provide more information. E.g. ECN for RTP/UDP provides 
       explicit the number of ECT(0), ECT(1), CE, non-ECT marked and lost packets. 
       However, deploying new TCP options has its own challenges. A separate 
       document proposes a new TCP Option for accurate ECN feedback 
       <xref target="I-D.kuehlewind-tcpm-accurate-ecn-option"/>. This option 
       could be used in addition to a more accurate ECN feedback scheme described 
       here or in addition to classic ECN, when available and needed.
     </t>
        </section>
     <!--<t>Combining the idea of <xref target="eci_mode"/> and <xref target="cp_mode"/>,
     further extending it to a one-octet option, would allow the signaling of two 
     values, each with 4 bit. The gains in worst case ACK loss, delayed ACK ratios
     and maintaining ECN Nonce would scale accordingly.
    </t>
    <t>Alternatively, if timestamp capability negotiation is supported, a few
     bits could be extracted from the timestamp value, to provide extended
     signaling. However, processing TCP options (or overloaded TCP options) is
     more complex than processing of header flags.
