RFC 2916 assigned responsibility for a number of administrative and
operational details of Telephone Number Mapping (ENUM) to the IAB.  It
also anticipated that ITU would take responsibility for determining
the legitimacy and appropriateness of applicants for delegation of
"country code"-level subdomains of the top-level ENUM domain.
Recently, three memos have been prepared for the ITU-T Study Group 2
(SG2) to explain the background of, and reasoning for, the relevant
decisions.  The IAB has also supplied a set of procedural instructions
to the RIPE NCC for implementation of their part of the model.  The
content of the three memos is provided in this document for the
information of the IETF community. 

This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does
not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of this
memo is unlimited.

This announcement is sent to the IETF list and the RFC-DIST list.
Requests to be added to or deleted from the IETF distribution list
should be sent to IETF-REQUEST@IETF.ORG.  Requests to be
added to or deleted from the RFC-DIST distribution list should
be sent to RFC-DIST-REQUEST@RFC-EDITOR.ORG.
