1. Introduction 

   [G.694.1v1] defines the DWDM frequency grids for WDM applications. A 
   frequency grid is a reference set of frequencies used to denote 
   allowed nominal central frequencies that may be used for defining 
   applications. The channel spacing, i.e. the frequency spacing 
   between two allowed nominal central frequencies could be 12.5 GHz, 
   25 GHz, 50 GHz, 100 GHz or integer multiples of 100 GHz as defined 
   in [G.694.1v1]. The frequency spacing of the channels on a fiber is 
   fixed.  

   The data rate of optical signals becomes higher and higher with the 
   advancement of the optical technology. In the near future, it is 
   anticipated that high data rate signals (beyond 100 Gbit/s or even 
   400 Gbit/s) will be deployed in optical networks. These signals may 
   not be accommodated in the channel spacing specified in old 
   [G.694.1v1]. Moreover, ''mixed rate'' scenarios will be prevalent, and 
   the optical signals with different rates may require different 
   spectrum width. As a result, when the optical signals with different 
   rates are mixed to be transmitted on the same fiber, the frequency 
   allocation needs to be more flexible so as to improve spectral 
   efficiency.  

   An updated version of [G.694.1v1], i.e., [G.FLEXIGRID] has been 
   consented in December 2011 in support of flexible grids. The terms 
   ''frequency slot (the frequency range allocated to a channel and 
   unavailable to other channels within a flexible grid)'' and ''slot 
   width'' (the full width of a frequency slot in a flexible grid) are 
   introduced to address flexible grid extensions. A channel is 
   represented as a LSC (Lambda Switching Capable) LSP in the control 
   plane, and it means that a LSC LSP should occupy a frequency slot on 
   each fiber it traverses. In the case of flexible grid, different LSC 
   LSPs may have different slot widths on a fiber.  

   Thus the concept of Wavelength Switched Optical Network(WSON) is 
   extended to Spectrum Switched Optical Network (SSON) which includes 
   flexible capabilities (i.e. flexi-grid). In SSON, a data plane 
   connection is switched based on an optical spectrum frequency slot 
   of a variable (flexible) slot width, rather than based on a single 
   wavelength within a fixed grid and with a fixed channel spacing as 
   is the case for WSON. In this sense, a WSON can be seen as a 
   particular case of a SSON in which all slot widths are equal and 
   central frequencies depend on the used channel spacing.

   WSON related documents are currently being developed with the focus 
   of the GMPLS control of fixed grid optical networks. This document 
   describes the new characteristics of SSON and provides the framework 
   of GMPLS control for the new features of SSON beyond WSON. 

   Note that this document focuses on the general properties of SSON. 
   Information related to optical impairments is out of its scope and 
   will be addressed in a separate draft. 

2. Terminology 

   Flexible Grid: a new WDM frequency grid defined with the aim of 
   allowing flexible optical spectrum management, in which the Slot 
   Width of the frequency ranges allocated to different channels are 
   flexible (variable size). 

   Frequency Range: a frequency range is defined as the portion of 
   frequency spectrum included between a lowest and a highest frequency. 

   Frequency Slot: the frequency range allocated to a slot and 
   unavailable to other slots within a flexible grid. A frequency slot 
   is defined by its nominal central frequency and its slot width. 

   Slot Width: the full width (in Hz) of a frequency slot. A slot width 
   can be expressed as a multiple (m) of a basic slot width (e.g. 12.5 
   GHz). 

   SSON: Spectrum-Switched Optical Network. An optical network in which 
   a data plane connection is switched based on an optical spectrum 
   frequency slot of a variable slot width, rather than based on a 
   fixed grid and fixed slot width. Please note that a Wavelength 
   Switched Optical Network (WSON) can be seen as a particular case of 
   SSON in which all slot widths are equal and depend on the used 
   channel spacing. 

   Flexi-LSP: a control plane construct that represents a data plane 
   connection in which the switching involves a frequency slot of a 
   variable (flexible) slot width. The mapped client signal is 
   transported over the frequency slot, using spectrum efficient 
   modulations such as Coherent Optical Orthogonal Frequency Division 
   Multiplexing (CO-OFDM) and Forward Error Correction (FEC) techniques. 
   Although still in the scope of LSC, the term flexi-LSP is used, when 
   needed, to differentiate from regular WSON LSP in which switching is 
   based on a nominal wavelength. 

   RSA: Routing and Spectrum Assignment. As opposed to the typical 
   Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) problem of traditional WDM

   networks, the flexibility in SSON leads to spectral contiguous 
   constraint, which means that when assigning the spectral resources 
   to single connections, the resources assigned to them must be 
   contiguous over the entire connections in the spectrum domain. RSA 
   is introduced to describe the routing and spectrum assignment 
   procedures.  

3. New characteristics of SSON 

   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs) are constructed from 
   subsystems that include Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) links, 
   tunable transmitters and receivers, Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop 
   Multiplexers (ROADMs), wavelength converters, and electro-optical 
   network elements. WSON framework is described in [RFC6163]. The 
   introduced flexible grid brings some changes on GMPLS controlled 
   optical networks.  

   The concept of WSON is extended to SSON, to highlight that such 
   subsystems are extended with flexible capabilities (i.e. flexi-grid). 
   Note that, when modeling SSONs, a WSON can be seen as a particular 
   case of SSON where all LSC LSPs use a fixed (and equal) slot width 
   which depends on the used channel spacing. 

   In WSON, the joint determination of an optical path (physical route) 
   along with the nominal wavelength on a fiber is known as Routing and 
   Wavelength Assignment (RWA). Wavelength Assignment (WA) is the 
   determination of which wavelength can be used for a specific optical 
   path. In analogy with WSON, in SSON, the determination of a path and 
   a frequency slot (including both central frequency and slot width) 
   is referred to as Routing and Spectrum Assignment (RSA). Spectrum 
   Assignment (SA) is the process of determining the spectrum range 
   that can be used for one specific flex-LSP given a physical route.  

   Compared to WSON, flexibility needs to be introduced in optical 
   network devices such as ROADMs or optical transponders in order to 
   fully benefit from SSON (flexible grid) improved spectrum management. 
   Consequently, transceivers may be able to fully leverage flexible 
   optical channels with advanced modulation formats, and ROADMs may 
   need to be extended to allow flexible spectrum switching. 

   A flexible grid is defined for the DWDM system in [G.FLEXIGRID]. 
   Compared to fixed grids a flexible grid has a smaller granularity 
   for the central frequencies and the slot width may range from say, 
   12.5 GHz to hundreds of GHz, in order to accommodate different 
   client data rates. The subsequent sections analyze the new 
   characteristics of flexible grid based on standard [G.FLEXIGRID],

   and then model ROADMs, and optical transponders in SSON with an 
   emphasis on those aspects that are of relevance to the control plane. 

3.1. Overview of Flexible Grid 

   o Central Frequency  

     According to the definition of flexible DWDM grid in [G.FLEXIGRID], 
     the allowed nominal central frequencies are calculated as in the 
     case of flexible grid:  

               Central Frequency = 193.1 THz + n * 0.00625 THz 

     Where 193.1 THz is ITU-T ''anchor frequency'' for transmission over 
     the C band, n is a positive or negative integer including 0 and 
     0.00625 THz is the nominal central frequency granularity. 

   o Slot Width  

     A slot width is defined by: 

                                12.5 GHz * m  

     Where m is a positive integer and 12.5 GHz is the slot width 
     granularity. 

     Note that, when flexi-grid is supported on a WDM link, the slot 
     width of different flexi-LSPs may be different. 

   The WDM link for flexible grid can be represented as shown in figure 
   1.

   The symbol ''--" represents the basic 6.25 GHz frequency slot. The 
   number on the top of the line represents the 'n' in the frequency 
   calculation formula. The nominal central frequency is 193.1 THz when 
   n equals zero.

   As Described in [G.FLEXIGRID], the flexible DWDM grid has a nominal 
   central frequency granularity of 6.25 GHz and a slot width 
   granularity of 12.5 GHz. However, devices or applications that make 
   use of the flexible grid, may not have to be capable of supporting 
   every possible slot width or central frequency granularity. For 
   example, ROADM and transceivers in SSON may support subset of all 
   possible slot width or posit defined in [G.FLEXIGRID]. 

3.2. ROADM 

   To support flexi grid, a ROADM is a key device which allows 
   spectrum-based optical switching. A classic degree-4 ROADM is shown 
   in Figure 2.

                   Figure 2 Degree-4 Bidirectional ROADM 
    

   The key feature of ROADMs is their highly asymmetric switching 
   capability which is described in [RFC6163] in detail. The asymmetric 
   switching feature of flexible ROADM in SSON is similar to fixed 
   ROADM in WSON. The ports on ROADM include line side port which is 
   connected to WDM link, tributary side input/output port which is 
   connected to transmitter/receiver. The main difference between 
   ROADMs in SSON and WSON is the capability of ports on ROADM, which 
   are characterized as follows:  

   From a SSON control plane perspective (in terms of path computation 
   and resource allocation), ROADMs line side ports are characterized 
   by the following aspects:

draft-zhang-ccamp-sson-framework-00.txt                      March 2012 
    

   o Available frequency ranges: the set or union of frequency ranges 
      that are not allocated (i.e. available or unused. The relative 
      grouping and distribution of available frequency ranges in a fiber 
      is usually referred to as ''fragmentation''. 

   o Available slot width ranges: the set or union of slot width ranges 
      supported by ROADM. It includes the following information: 

      o  Slot width threshold: the minimum and maximum Slot Width 
         supported by ROADM. For example, the slot width can be from 
         50GHz to 200GHz. 

      o  Step granularity: the minimum step by which the optical filter 
         bandwidth of ROADM can be increased or decreased. This 
         parameter is typically equal to slot width granularity defined 
         in [G.FLEXIGRID] (i.e. 12.5GHz) or integer multiples of 12.5GHz. 

   These properties can be injected into the link parameters from the 
   control plane perspective, which is described in Section 5. 

   Since the tributary side port is connected to a transmitter and 
   receiver, the characterization of tributary side ports is described 
   in the next section. 

3.3. Optical Transmitters and Receivers 

   In WSON, the optical transmitter is the wavelength source and the 
   optical receiver is the wavelength sink of the WDM system. In each 
   direction, the wavelength used by the transmitter and receiver along 
   a path shall be consistent if no wavelength converter is available. 
   The central frequency used by a transmitter or receiver may be fixed 
   or tunable. 

   In SSON the optical spectrum (frequency slot width) used by 
   different flexi-LSPs may be variable. Optical transmitters/receivers 
   may have different restriction on the following properties: 

   o Available central frequencies: The set of central frequencies 
      which can be used by an optical transmitter/receiver.  

   o Slot width: The slot width needed by a transmitter/receiver.  

      The slot width is dependent on bit rate and modulation format. For 
      one specific transmitter, the bit rate and modulation format may 
      be tunable, so slot width would be determined by the modulation 
      format used at a given bit rate.

draft-zhang-ccamp-sson-framework-00.txt                      March 2012 
    

   Similarly, other information on transmitters and receivers 
   capabilities, in regard to signal processing is needed to perform 
   efficient RSA, much like in WSON [WSON-ENCODE].  

4. Routing and Spectrum Assignment 

   A LSC flexi-LSP occupies a frequency slot, i.e. a range of 
   frequencies, on each link the LSP traverses.  

   Much like in WSON, in which if there is no (available) wavelength 
   converter in an optical network an LSP is subject to the ''wavelength 
   continuity constraint'' (see section 4 of [RFC6163]), in SSON if the 
   capability of shifting or converting the whole optical spectrum 
   allocated to a flex-LSP is not available, the flexi-LSP is subject 
   to the Optical ''Spectrum Continuity Constraint''. 

   Because of the limited availability of wavelength/spectrum 
   converters (sparse translucent optical network) the 
   wavelength/spectrum continuity constraint should always be 
   considered. When available, information regarding spectrum 
   conversion capabilities at the optical nodes may be used by RSA 
   mechanisms. 

   The RSA process determines a route and frequency slot for a flexi-
   LSP. Note that the mapping between client signals data rates (10, 40, 
   100... Gbps) and optical slot widths (which are dependent on 
   modulation formats and other physical layer parameters) is out of 
   the scope of this document. The frequency slot can be deduced from 
   the central frequency and slot width parameters as follows:  

   Lowest frequency = (central frequency) - (slot width)/2; 

   Highest frequency = (central frequency) + (slot width)/2.  

   Hence, when a route is computed the spectrum assignment process (SA) 
   should determine the central frequency for a flexi-LSP based on the 
   slot width and available central frequencies information of the 
   transmitter and receiver, and the available frequency ranges 
   information and available slot width ranges of the links that the

   The two wavelengths shown in figure 2 have the following meaning:  

   Flexi-LSP 1: central frequency = 193.1 THz, slot width = 25 GHz. It 
   means the frequency slot [193.0875 THz, 193.1125 THz] is assigned to 
   this LSC LSP.  

   Flexi-LSP 2: central frequency = 193.14375 THz, slot width = 37.5 
   GHz. It means the frequency slot [193.125 THz, 193.1625 THz] is 
   assigned to this LSC LSP.  

   Note that the frequency slots of two LSC flexi-LSPs on a fiber do 
   not overlap with each other, and a guard band may be considered to 
   counteract inter-channel detrimental effects.  

4.1. Architectural Approaches to RSA 

   Similar to RWA for fixed grids, different ways of performing RSA in 
   conjunction with the control plane can be considered. The approaches 
   included in this document are provided for reference purposes only; 
   other possible options could also be deployed. 

4.1.1. Combined RSA (R&SA) 

   In this case, a computation entity performs both routing and 
   frequency slot assignment. The computation entity should have the 
   detailed network information, e.g. connectivity topology constructed 
   by nodes/links information, available frequency ranges on each link, 
   node capability, etc.  

   The computation entity could reside on the following elements, which 
   depends on the implementation: 

   o PCE: PCE gets the detailed network information and implements the 
      RSA algorithm for RSA requests from the PCCs.

draft-zhang-ccamp-sson-framework-00.txt                      March 2012 
    

   o Ingress node: Ingress node gets the detailed network information 
      (e.g. through routing protocol) and implements the RSA algorithm 
      when a LSC LSP request is received. 

4.1.2. Separated RSA (R+SA) 

   In this case, routing computation and frequency slot assignment are 
   performed by different entities. The first entity computes the 
   routes and provides them to the second entity; the second entity 
   assigns the frequency slot.  

   The first entity should get the connectivity topology to compute the 
   proper routes; the second entity should get the available frequency 
   ranges of the links and nodes' capabilities information to assign 
   the spectrum. 

4.1.3. Routing and Distributed SA (R+DSA) 

   In this case, one entity computes the route but the frequency slot 
   assignment is performed hop-by-hop in a distributed way along the 
   route. The available central frequencies which meet the wavelength 
   continuity constraint should be collected hop by hop along the route. 
   This procedure can be implemented by the GMPLS signaling protocol.  

   The GMPLS signaling procedure is similar to the one described in 
   section 4.1.3 of [RFC6163] except that the label set should specify 
   the available central frequencies that meet the slot width 
   requirement of the LSC LSP, i.e. the frequency slot which is 
   determined by the central frequency and slot width MUST NOT overlap 
   with the existing LSC LSPs. 

5. Requirements for GMPLS Control Plane 

   According to the different architecture approaches to RSA some 
   additional requirements have to be considered for the GMPLS control 
   of SSONs. 

5.1. Routing 

   In the case of combined RSA architecture, the computation entity 
   needs to get the detailed network information, i.e. connectivity 
   topology, node capabilities and available frequency ranges of the 
   links. Route computation is performed based on the connectivity 
   topology and node capabilities; spectrum assignment is performed 
   based on the available frequency ranges of the links. The 
   computation entity may get the detailed network information by the 
   GMPLS routing protocol.

   Compared with [RFC6163], except wavelength-specific availability 
   information, the connectivity topology and node capabilities are the 
   same as WSON, which can be advertised by GMPLS routing protocol 
   (refer to section 6.2 of [RFC6163]. This section analyses the 
   necessary changes on link information brought by flexible grids. 

5.1.1. Available Frequency Ranges of DWDM Links 

   In the case of flexible grids, channel central frequencies span from 
   193.1 THz towards both ends of the C band spectrum with 6.25 GHz 
   granularity.  Different LSC LSPs could make use of different slot 
   widths on the same link. Hence, the available frequency ranges 
   should be advertised. 

5.1.2. Available Slot Width Ranges of DWDM Links 

   The available slot width ranges needs to be advertised in order to 
   understand whether a LSC LSCP with a given slot width can be set up 
   or not.  

   Whether a LSC LSP with a certain slot width can be set up or not is 
   constrained by the available slot width ranges of flexible ROADM. So 
   the available slot width ranges should be advertised. 

5.1.3. Tunable Optical Transmitters and Receivers 

   The slot width of a LSC LSP is determined by the transmitter and 
   receiver that could be mapped to ADD/DROP interfaces in WSON. 
   Moreover their central frequency could be fixed or tunable, hence, 
   both the slot width of an ADD/DROP interface and the available 
   central frequencies should be advertised.  

5.2. Signaling 

   Compared with [RFC6163], except identifying the resource (i.e., 
   fixed wavelength for WSON and frequency resource for flexible grids), 
   the other signaling requirements (e.g., unidirectional or 
   bidirectional, with or without converters) are the same as WSON 
   described in the section 6.1 of [RFC6163]. 

   In the case of routing and distributed SA, GMPLS signaling can be 
   used to allocate the frequency slot to a LSC LSP. This brings the 
   following changes to the GMPLS signaling.

draft-zhang-ccamp-sson-framework-00.txt                      March 2012 
    

5.2.1. Slot Width Requirement 

   In order to allocate a proper frequency slot for a LSC LSP, the 
   signaling should specify the slot width requirement of a LSC LSP. 
   Then the intermediate nodes can collect the acceptable central 
   frequencies that meet the slot width requirement hop by hop.  

   The tail-end node also needs to know the slot width of a LSC LSP to 
   assign the proper frequency resource. Hence, the slot width 
   requirement should be specified in the signaling message when a LSC 
   LSP is being set up. 

5.2.2. Frequency Slot Representation 

   The frequency slot can be determined by the central frequency (n 
   value) and slot width (m value) as described in section 5. Such 
   parameters should be able to be specified by the signaling protocol.   

5.3. PCE 

   [WSON-PCE] describes the architecture and requirements of PCE for 
   WSON. In the case of flexible grid, RSA instead of RWA is used for 
   routing and frequency slot assignment. Hence PCE should implement 
   RSA for flexible grids. The architecture and requirements of PCE for 
   flexible grids are similar to what is described in [WSON-PCE]. This 
   section describes the changes brought by flexible grids. 

5.3.1. RSA Computation Type 

   A PCEP request within a PCReq message MUST be able to specify the 
   computation type of the request:  

   o Combined RSA: Both the route and frequency slot should be provided 
      by PCE.  

   o Routing Only: Only the route is requested to be provided by PCE.  

   The PCEP response within a PCRep Message MUST be able to specify the 
   route and the frequency slot assigned to the route. 

   RSA in SSON MAY include the check of signal processing capabilities, 
   which MAY be provided by the IGP. A PCC should be able to indicate 
   additional restrictions for such signal compatibility, either on the 
   endpoint or any given link (such as regeneration points).

draft-zhang-ccamp-sson-framework-00.txt                      March 2012 
    

   A PCC MUST be able to specify whether the PCE MUST also assign a 
   Modulation list and/or a FEC list, as defined in [WSON-ENCODE] and 
   [WSON-PCE]. 

   A PCC MUST be able to specify whether the PCE MUST or SHOULD include 
   or exclude specific modulation formats and FEC mechanisms. 

   In the case where a valid path is not found, the response MUST be 
   able to specify the reason (e.g., no route, spectrum not found, etc.) 

5.3.2. RSA path re-optimization request/reply 

   For a re-optimization request, the PCEP request MUST provide the 
   path to be re-optimized and include the following options: 

   o Re-optimize the path keeping the same frequency slot.  

   o Re-optimize spectrum keeping the same path.  

   o Re-optimize allowing both frequency slot and the path to change.  

   The corresponding PCEP response for the re-optimized request MUST 
   provide the Re-optimized path and frequency slot. 

   In case a path is not found, the response MUST include the reason 
   (e.g., no route, frequency slot not found, both of route and 
   frequency slot not found, etc.) 

5.3.3. Frequency Constraints 

   A PCE should consider the following constraints brought by the 
   transmitters and receivers:  

   o Available central frequencies: The set of central frequencies that 
      can be used by an optical transmitter or receiver.  

   o Slot width: The slot width needed by a transmitter or receiver.  

   These constraints may be provided by the requester (PCC) in the PCEP 
   request or reside within the PCE's TEDB which stores the 
   transponder's capabilities.  

   A PCC may also specify the frequency constraints for policy reasons. 
   In this case, the constraints should be specified in the request 
   sent to the PCE. In any case, the PCE will compute the route and 
   assign the frequency slot to meet the constraints specified in

   theafore mentioned request and it will then return the result of the 
   path computation to the PCC in the corresponding response.
