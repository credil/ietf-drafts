        Object Naming Framework for the Future Internet   February 2013 
                                    
                                    
1. Introduction 

   The one of new capabilities for the Future Internet will be the 
   ubiquitous networking such as the Internet of things. This networking 
   capability should support "Any Time, Any Where, Any Service, Any 
   Network and Any Object (so-called "5-Any")" operation. The naming of 
   objects is crucial to this new paradigm.  

   Traditional communication regime revolves around the end hosts. It 
   is necessary that in this host centric communication paradigm, any 
   user/application, trying to access a resource, is be able to connect 
   to that particular host holding the resource. However a new 
   communication paradigm [1], based on the concept of information and 
   content, takes away the central role from the end hosts and instead 
   puts resources (information elements/content/data) in the lead role. 
   Examples of such resources include a news item, a sensor/RFID tag, 
   multimedia content, document file among many others. 

   Each of these resources can be represented as an independent object. 
   In order to discover, publish and connect to these objects  using 
   heterogeneous networks, a simple, ubiquitous, independent, 
   unobtrusive and cost-effective system of object identification is 
   crucial. In emerging Future Internet paradigm, objects not only 
   represent the hosts (e.g., PC, Servers, Mobile Phones and Tablets 
   etc.) but also represent information elements, content and data 
   contained by these hosts. Hence a proper object naming mechanism is 
   required to present these objects in a transparent way and allow 
   their discovery, publication and other necessary operations.   

   This document describes the framework for object naming for the 
   Future Internet. For identification of network entities, we consider 
   new type of identifiers (e.g., OID, RFID code, content ID) for 
   objects and propose specific requirements for object identification 
   from naming point of view.  

   For architectural aspects, this document shows a generic framework 
   for identity processing and mapping relationships between several 
   identities with conceptual diagram. Also stack architecture of 
   relationships and object mapping schemes are discussed. 

   Compared to several alternative architectures for object naming, this 
   document aims to provide requirements and right direction towards 
   realization of object naming.

2. Objects - Basics 

2.1. Definition of object 

   Anything in some world, generally the world of telecommunications and 
   information processing or some part thereof, which is identifiable 
   (can be named) and may be registered [ITU-T X.660]. An object is 
   distinct from other objects and is characterized by its behavior, 
   properties and relationship with other objects. 

   An object is informally said to perform functions and offer services 
   (an object which performs a function available to other entities 
   and/or objects is said to offer a service). For modeling purposes, 
   these functions and services are specified in terms of the behavior 
   of the object and of its interfaces. An object can perform more than 
   one function. A function can be performed with the cooperation of 
   several objects. An object interacts with its environment including 
   other objects at its interaction points thus forming a relationship. 

   NOTE - Objects include terminal devices (e.g., used by a person to 
   access the network such as mobile phones, personal computers, etc.), 
   remote monitoring devices (e.g., cameras, sensors, etc.), information 
   devices (e.g., content delivery server), products, contents, 
   resources and information elements (e.g., video, audio files, 
   documents, webpages, etc.). 

   NOTE - the above definition was quoted from ITU-T [Y.2002]. 

2.2. Object identity 

   Identity defines uniqueness or oneness of an object, helping it to be 
   distinguished from other objects. But different notions of identity 
   exist for different levels of abstraction, therefore, identity is 
   crucial to define that what an object stands for [2].  

2.3. Types of objects 

   In the context of Future Internet anything (physical or virtual) that 
   fulfills the definition given in Section 2.1 is considered as an 
   object. 

   Regarding physical objects, there are many different types of devices 
   connecting to networks supporting ubiquitous networking for Future 
   Internet. RFID tag, sensors, actuator, smart cards, medical devices, 
   navigation devices, vehicles as well as the existing personal devices 
   such as PC and Smartphones are examples of these. This document 
   considers the end points which are not always humans but may be

   objects such as devices/machines, and then expanding to small objects 
   and parts of objects. In this regard the object means any device that 
   has the communication capabilities and is able to connect to the 
   network. It includes almost everything around us such as utility, 
   personal and information devices/machines/contents etc.  

   Information elements, contents and even the data itself can be 
   described as virtual objects. Examples of virtual objects include 
   (but are not limited to) video and audio content, movies, documents 
   files, image files, webpages, meaningful information/data like sports 
   news. 

   Figure 1 shows the relationship between humans and objects and its 
   connection with Internet. The types of objects on the end-user side 
   include the following: personal devices, information devices, 
   RFID/sensors, contents, appliances, vehicles, etc.

3. Object identification 

3.1. Identification Mechanisms 

   Identification of all objects for providing end-to-end connectivity 
   in ubiquitous networking environment is crucial. An identifier is 
   capable of uniquely identifying an associated object and facilitates 
   objects-to-objects communications. In particular, a globally unique 
   identifier enables a lot of applications including item tracking, 
   access control, and protection, etc. [3]. A unique identifier can 
   also help in verifying the authenticity of an object. 

   There are many kinds of identifiers such as E.164 numbering plan, 
   Extended Unique Identifier (EUI)-64, Media Access Control (MAC) 
   address, Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)/ Uniform Resource Locator 
   (URL), etc.  

   These identifiers can be classified as follows. 

   o Object IDs: include RFID, Content ID, telephone number, URL/URI, 
     etc. 

   o Communication IDs: include session/protocol ID, IP address, MAC 
     address, etc. 

   This document basically considers an "Object ID" which generally 
   takes the form of an application-specific integer or pointer that 
   uniquely identifies an object. 

3.2. Examples of object identification 

3.2.1. RFID 

   The identification codes, so-called Electronic Product Code (EPC), 
   for RFID/sensors are very important in ubiquitous networking 
   environment. An EPC is simply a number assigned to an RFID tag 
   representative of an actual electronic product code. Their value is 
   carefully characterized and categorized, so that it can convey a 
   certain meanings within their structure. Each number is encoded with 
   a header, identifying the particular EPC version used for coding the 
   entire EPC number. An EPC manager number is defined, allowing 
   individual companies or organizations to be uniquely identifiable; an 
   object class number is present, identifying objects used within this 
   organization, such as product types. Finally, there is a serial 
   number that, allows the unique identification of each individual 
   object tagged by the organization [4]. The key service, that allows 
   mapping between the EPC and information corresponding to the object

   is, Object Naming Service (ONS). ONS works much like Domain Name 
   System (DNS) and has similar hierarchical architecture as DNS. 

3.2.2. Content ID 

   The Content ID is a unique identifier that can specify and 
   distinguish any kind of digital contents that are distributed. As a 
   unique code attached to a content object, the Content ID serves well 
   enough as an identifier. However, it is also the key to a complete 
   set of attribute information about a content object stored as 
   metadata including the nature of the contents, rights-related 
   information, information about distribution, and more. The Content ID 
   provides the key enabling metadata to be uniquely associated with a 
   particular digital object [4]. 

3.2.3. Object Identifier (OID) 

   OID is a tree based scheme standardized by ITU-T and is capable to 
   uniquely name an object, but instead OID is used to identify a type 
   of identifier and then actual resolution is delegated to another 
   identifier mechanism. OID can be used as a meta-identifier to locate 
   the proper identification service [RFC6253]. 

3.2.4. Named Data Objects (NDO) 

   NDO is the basis of several Future Internet architectures and 
   research projects focused on Information Centric Networking (ICN). An 
   object has a verifiable binding between itself and its name to ensure 
   authenticity. The name of the object can be human readable as well as 
   some ID generated through some mechanism. Two naming schemes are 
   popular for NDOs. One is hierarchical and other is flat namespace. 
   The hierarchical scheme is similar to current URL structure.  Flat 
   namespace scheme is without any hierarchical structure and works by 
   either embedding the hash of the object or public key of the 
   publisher in its name [1]. 

3.3. Classification of network entities to be identified 

   There are several network entities in a network. These network 
   entities have a layered architecture and are used for naming, 
   addressing and routing. Following are examples of these network 
   entities. 

   o Services (i.e., information related to applications/services) 

   o End points (i.e., global unique identifier)

        Object Naming Framework for the Future Internet   February 2013 
                                    
                                    
   o Location (i.e., IP address) 

   o Path (i.e., routing) 

   o Information elements (i.e., video and audio files, document files, 
     image files) 

3.4. Requirements for naming using object identification 

   In order to enable object to object communication in Future Internet, 
   how to map/bind Communication IDs (e.g., IP address) with Object IDs 
   (e.g., content IDs) for providing end-to-end IP connectivity is a 
   challenging issue.  

   Additionally, the following features MUST be provided using naming 
   capability through object identification.  

   o Considering the amount of information objects currently available 
     on the Internet, by conservative estimates any object naming 
     scheme should be able to support 10^15 objects, this estimate does 
     not include the physical devices/machines. It is imperative to use 
     name spaces that can support these huge number of devices. 

   o Protection of object (including right management) using 
     appropriate security mechanism(s). 

   o Ownership Identification: To track the original owner/creator of 
     the object. 

   o Object authentication and verification to eliminate the Denial of 
     Service (DoS) attacks. 

   o Providing the connectivity to end device without additional 
     equipment such as Network Address Translator using object 
     identification. 

   o Service and location discovery through performing two functions; 
     Routing using network prefix information and identification code 
     using object IDs. 

   o Application Programming Interface to allow producers and consumers 
     of the content to publish and receive their objects.

4. Object to object communications 

   For ubiquitous networking [Y.2002], Future Internet will require the 
   extensions of networking functionalities to all objects. New 
   networking concept will be considered for networking capabilities to 
   support various classes of applications/services which support "Any 
   Time, Any Where, Any Service, Any Network and Any Object" operation 
   using Internet. This networking capability should support human-to-
   human, human-to-object (e.g., device, content and/or machine) and 
   object-to-object communications. 

    

5. Object Naming Framework 

5.1. The mapping relationships between host and object(s) 

   In this document, host means a device that communicates using the 
   Internet protocols (i.e., IP addresses). 

5.1.1. Host = Object (one to one mapping) 

   In case a host is equal to an object, there is one to one mapping 
   relationship between host and object. Most of information devices 
   such as PC, smartphones are included in this case.  

5.1.2. Host =! Object (one to many mapping) 

   In case a host is not equal to an object, there is one to many 
   mapping relationship between host and object(s). Content server, NDOs, 
   RFID tags/Reader etc. are included in this case. 

   There are two cases of one to many mapping as follows (see Figure 2): 

   o As shown in Figure 2 (a) host including objects such as a content 
     server, a host includes many objects and these objects MUST be 
     identified using content ID, object name etc. 

   o As shown in Figure 2 (b) host with remote objects such as RFID 
     tags, a host has many remote objects and these objects MUST be 
     identified using appropriate mechanism (e.g., RFID code). In this 
     case, each object might be non IP.

5.2. The Mapping relationships without hosts 

An upcoming view of Future Internet is information centric rather than 
host centric. This is popularly known as ICN. There is no concept of 
host devices and objects are accessible using their names. This is 
obviously beneficial as the objects can be accessed even when host 
change their location. The objects will reside in the host machines but 
there will be no need for the resolution of host address to retrieve 
them. While host centric approach is used today, it is envisioned that 
ICN will overtake it in near future. Figure 2 (c) shows the mapping of 
NDO to its multiple representations and multiple copies that are 
accessible to users.  

Layered architecture for identity processing 

   As shown in Figure 3, the layered architecture of identity processing 
   requires  specific  processing  capabilities  at  each  layer.  Each 
   user/object in applications has an identity like name with a set of 
   attributes. An attribute can be termed of as metadata that belongs to 
   a specific entity in a specific context, some of which could to be 
   highly private or sensitive. The identity should be associated with 
   object IDs through identification and authorization. Each object ID 
   also  should  be  associated  with  communication  IDs  through 
   mapping/binding mechanisms [Y.2055].

5.3. The stack architecture 

   The stack architecture shows the mapping relationships between host 
   and object(s).

   o As shown in Figure 4 (a) objects in a host (case #1), the end 
     point is a host itself. Each object at the service layer SHOULD be 
     identified by a host using mapping protocol for the object. 

   o As shown in Figure 4 (b) remote objects (case #2), each object 
     will be the end point. This means that host location is different 
     from end point(s). Thus, a host SHOULD be able to support several 
     end points. From object information in service layer, each object 
     identity should be defined. 

    

5.4. Object mapping schemes 

   For host centric networking there are two kinds of object mapping 
   schemes using one to many mapping relationship as follows: 

   o Direct mapping (Figure 4 (a)) 

      An object at application layer is directly reachable to host 
      entity at network attachment point where IP is terminated. An 
      object is located on top of TCP/IP protocol stack. For example, a 
      host, such as content server, includes many objects and these 
      objects MUST be identified using content ID, etc. 

   o Indirect mapping (Figure 4 (b)) 

      An object at application layer is remotely reachable through non-
      IP interface to host entity at network attachment point where IP 
      is terminated. An object is located outside of physical network 
      attachment where IP is terminated. For example, a host has many 
      remote objects, such as RFID tags. These objects MUST be 
      identified using appropriate mechanism e.g. RFID code, etc. In 
      this case, each object might be non IP.

   For ICN, there is only one mapping option possible where an object is 
   named and accessed with the same name without taking into 
   consideration of host identity or address.  

5.5. Providing connectivity to objects 

   For providing connectivity to objects using object identification, 
   the Figure 5 shows object mapping/ binding with IP address for IP 
   connectivity to all objects on end-user side. This scheme can provide 
   the global Internet connectivity to objects through the association 
   (e.g., mapping/binding) between identifier for object and IP address.

6. Object Naming Usage  

   It is important to highlight the use of object naming and its 
   benefits through examples use cases. [ICNSec] presents different 
   scenarios pertinent to information-centric networking. However we 
   present here the existing work in the context of smart vehicles in a 
   smart city scenario that uses NDOs to illustrate the usefulness of 
   the object naming framework. 

   The concept of smart city is a broad one and covers many aspects of 
   urban life. From e-government to smart street lights and smart 
   vehicles, the vision of a smart city is to utilize the ICT 
   technologies to make a better living experience for the city 
   residents and to provide managed and smart services by reducing time, 
   effort and cost. 

   The authors in [7] present traffic information dissemination 
   application which works by using NDOs. Their earlier work [8] 
   discusses a case study and provides vehicular communication using 
   NDOs instead of using traditional IP. In their case study the 
   vehicles act as producers and consumers of the information about road 
   events. Traffic related information is propagated using NDOs instead 
   of the IP address which is the current norm.  

7. Considerations of Protocols for Naming Objects 

7.1. Security association 

   It is critical to provide security association for secure binding 
   between object identity and IP address and between object and its 
   name in the context of ICN. Similarly access to attribute information 
   of objects MUST be identified and authorized. Mechanisms must be used 
   to ensure that the object is authenticated before transmitting it to 
   the end user. Traditionally host authentication was enough to 
   authenticate the content/object itself but in ICN the absence of host 
   removes this option. Reference [6] provides a good overview of this 
   issue.

7.2. Support of DNS 

   An ID resolution server such as Domain Name System (DNS) can provide 
   functionality to translate the object identifier into service 
   /communication ID to access networking services. This will also 
   support hierarchical naming schemes of ICN. 

   In order to support existing infrastructure, including DNS, it is 
   required to define DNS resource records. The newly defined DNS 
   resource records should include information on object IDs.  

    

7.3. Protocol overhead 

   Because of Real time communications and due to limitations of power 
   and packet size, lightweight identity handshake for datagram 
   transactions SHOULD be taken into consideration. 

    

7.4. Common identifier for object 

   Most of identifiers for objects are specified with different format 
   according to applications. However, in order to contain information 
   of all objects in protocol message and because of global 
   interoperability, it is required to specify common identifier and 
   rules to accommodate all objects with unified format. 

 

7.5. Services using named objects 

   The proposed named objects can provide an integrated solution for 
   personal location and management through identification /naming 
   /addressing including ID registration, location tracking, dynamic 
   mobility control, and security using the following networking 
   services: 

   o Identity management (IdM) services for the management of the 
     identity life cycle of objects including managing unique IDs, 
     attributes, credentials, entitlements to consistently enforce 
     business and security policies.

   o Location management services for real-time location tracking, 
     monitoring, and information processing of moving objects similar 
     with Supply Chain Management. 

   o Networked ID (N-ID) services for providing communication service 
     which is triggered by an identification process started via 
     reading an identifier from identifier storage such as RFID tag, 
     barcode label, smartcard, etc. 

   o Home networking services for the management of multiple object 
     identities in a host and/or remote host using RFID tag, ubiquitous 
     sensor, etc. 

   o Content distribution services allowing users to find their desired 
     content (movies, documents, photos, etc.) using its name. This 
     will allow efficient content caching near the users thus 
     offloading the single content provider from overhead of millions 
     of users accessing its content simultaneously. The traditional 
     barrier of host address is also removed and it becomes easy to 
     shift content from one host to another without worrying about host 
     address. 

       

8. Naming of mobile objects 

   As in Future Internet large number of devices will be mobile e.g. 
   smartphones, vehicles etc. In such a scenario it is critical to come 
   up with a mechanism to name these mobile objects according to their 
   location. As the location of object(s) frequently changes in mobile 
   environment, the object ID should be used along with the location 
   information of the object.  

   But in ICN movement of an object does not have any effect on the 
   object access mechanism. In ICN object can be named without any 
   consideration of its current or future location. Location effectively 
   becomes irrelevant in ICN and that one of its biggest advantages.
