Abstract           

   LDP is widely deployed in MPLS networks to signal LSPs. Since LDP
   establishes LSPs along IGP routed paths, its failure recovery is
   gated by IGP's re-convergence. Mechanisms such as IPFRR and RSVP-TE
   based FRR have been used to provide faster re-route for LDP LSPs.
   However these techniques have significant complexity and/or may not
   have full coverage. In this document we describe a method to perform
   fast re-route of LDP LSPs. The goal is to have recovery
   characteristics similar to the methods in [RSVP-TE-FRR] without
   depending on additional protocols but at the same time provide full
   coverage.

Internet Draft                  FRR LDP                 October 31, 2011


1. Introduction

   LDP is a widely deployed signaling protocol in MPLS networks. It
   signals LSPs along IGP routed paths. In case of a failure in the
   network, the recovery of traffic on LDP LSPs is gated by re-
   convergence of IGPs. IGPs have relatively slower convergence since it
   is affected by factors such as link-state database flooding, re-
   computation etc. Approaches such as [IPFRR-LFA] can provide an
   alternate route that may be used by LDP. However this method does not
   provide full coverage. Other IPFRR methods such as [NOT-VIA] involve
   significant complexity. Another approach to protect LDP LSPs is to
   use RSVP-TE LSPs to the next-hop or next-next-hop and protect the LDP
   traffic by using the techniques specified in [RSVP-TE-FRR]. This has
   the complexity of deploying an additional protocol [RSVP-TE] in order
   to protect LDP LSPs.

   In this document we describe a local-repair mechanism that can
   provide fast-reroute for LDP LSPs without requiring additional
   mechanisms from other protocols. This mechanism is henceforth
   referred to as FRR-LDP. It aims to provide traffic recovery times
   similar to that provided by [RSVP-TE-FRR]. This mechanism works for a
   link-state IGP such as [OSPF] and [ISIS].

2.  Scope

   This draft is applicable only when per platform label spaces are
   used. Per interface label spaces are out of scope.

3.  Terminology

   SPT: Shortest Path Tree

   PLR: Point of Local Repair. The head-end LSR of a backup-SP LSP.

   Backup-SP LSP (BSP LSP): An LDP LSP that provides a backup for a
   specific failure on the shortest path LDP LSP. The failed entity may
   be a link, a node or a SRLG. This LSP originates from the PLR(s).

   Backup-SP Merge Point (BSP-MP): The LSR where the Backup-SP LSP is
   label switched to a label allocated for the shortest path LDP LSP. It
   need not be downstream of the failed entity.

   Exclude-SPT: The shortest path tree from a PLR to a destination, when
   a particular failure point (link, node, SRLG) is excluded from the
   topology.

4. LDP Local Repair Technique

Internet Draft                  FRR LDP                 October 31, 2011


   When a failure occurs in an IGP network, traffic along a shortest-
   path LSP that is upstream from the failure gets affected. Traffic
   along the shortest-path LSP that is not upstream of the failure does
   not get affected. A backup shortest-path LSP (BSP LSP) for a shortest
   path LSP (or FEC) is another LSP that goes from the PLR to an LSR
   that can label-switch the traffic back along that part of the
   shortest-path LSP that is not upstream for that failure. The LSR on
   which the BSP LSP terminates is called the BSP Merge Point or BSP-MP.

   The BSP LSPs are LDP LSPs. The BSP LSP becomes a single hop LSP when
   a Loop Free Alternate (LFA) is present. In such cases the mechanism
   in [IPFRR-LFA] is used. The mechanisms in this draft should be used
   when an LFA is not available.

   A shortest path LSP to the BSP-MP should be used as a BSP LSP if one
   is available. This must use label stacking as follows. First the
   label of the LSP should be swapped with that allocated by the BSP-MP
   for that FEC. Next, the label to the BSP-MP should be stacked. When a
   single such shortest path LSP is not available to be used as a BSP
   LSP, multiple shortest path LSPs and/or interfaces on directly
   connected LSRs can be stitched together. The LSRs that stitch such
   LSPs together do so by advertising another label for the FEC. This
   label is stacked below the shortest path LSP label. It is allocated
   on demand and is initiated from the PLR to the first stitching LSR.
   If there is a stitching LSR further downstream (i.e. towards the BSP-
   MP) the stitching LSR in turn requests a label from the downstream
   stitching LSR.

   The protocol extensions required to setup BSP LSPs are described in
   section 4. The label actions for the BSP LSPs are pre-installed in
   the forwarding tables. The PLR pre-computes the label-operation
   changes to be performed on the failure trigger. When the failure
   occurs, the PLR detects the failure as a local event and performs the
   pre-computed label operation actions. None of the LSRs along the BSP
   LSP other than the PLR have to perform any additional operation at
   the instant of failure in order to protect the traffic. FRR-LDP is a
   local repair mechanism that can protect against link, node and SRLG
   failures.

   The BSP LSPs that have to be setup depend on the network topology. It
   also depends on the type of protection (e.g. per-FEC or per-nexthop).
   Sample topologies with FRR-LDP applied are described in section 5.

5. Protocol procedures and extensions

   The PLR must establish a targeted LDP session with the BSP MP or the
   next stitching LSR to get the label bindings it needs for the backup
   LSP. It must negotiate the on-demand mode for the targeted sessions

   and request only those label bindings that it needs to protect the
   LSPs. Additionally the PLR sends the path information when the next
   LSR is a stitching LSR so that it can request the stitching LSR
   further downstream for label bindings. A new TLV "Backup Path Vector
   TLV" is defined. It should be noted that this TLV is required only
   when multiple shortest path LSPs need to be stitched together for the
   BSP LSP.

   The TLV consists of a list of addresses of stitching LSRs.

            1 - Indicates that the stitching LSR should use a shortest
      path LDP LSP to reach the next stitching LSR

            2 - Indicates that the stitching LSR should use a directly
      connected interface to reach the next stitching LSR

   This TLV is used in the "Label Request" message. Each stitching LSR
   removes the first address in this TLV before requesting a label from
   the next stitching LSR.

   A Capability TLV is defined for LDP in accordance to [LDP-CAP] to
   advertise its capability to process the "Backup Path Vector" TLV. An
   area scope capability TLV is also advertised via IGP ([OSPF-CAP] and
   [ISIS-CAP]) for the same so that the PLR can take it into account
   when computing the BSP LSP.

   In the example topology below, link A-B is of cost 100. All other
   links are unit cost. To protect against the failure of LSR E for FEC
   F, LSR C sets up a BSP LSP C-A-B-G where A and B stitch shortest path
   LSP C-A, the LSP A-B (due to B advertising a label to A) and the
   shortest path LSP B-G. The PLR (LSR C) computes the backup path by
   executing a shortest path computation on the topology excluding LSR
   E. It initiates a label-request towards LSR A for FEC F, with the
   "Backup Path Vector" TLV containing the address of LSR B (Hop Type 2)
   and of LSR G (Hop Type 1). LSR A further initiates a label-request
   towards LSR B with a "Backup Path Vector" TLV containing the address
   of LSR G (Hop Type 1). LSR B in turn initiates a label request for
   FEC F to LSR G (without the Backup Path Vector TLV). Note that in
   this case since B and G are directly connected this label may be the
   same one that LSR G had originally allocated for F. LSR B then
   allocates a label F, sets the label operation to swap to the label
   allocated by G and to forward over LSP B-G and returns that label in
   the label response to LSR A. LSR A in turn allocates another label
   for F, sets the label operation to swap to the label allocated by B
   and to forward over LSP A-B and returns that label in the label
   response to LSR C.
