1.  Introduction

   This document introduces an information model for network topologies.
   The model allows applications to have a holistic view of an entire
   network.  [I-D.amante-i2rs-topology-use-cases] describes an entity -
   the Topology Manager - that would create a cohesive, abstracted model
   of the network and expose it to applications via northbound API.

Internet-Draft    draft-medved-i2rs-topology-im-00.txt         July 2013


   The information model can be related to a corresponding data model,
   for example, a data model defined in YANG [RFC6020], defining the
   actual data that is exchanged across specific interfaces.  On the
   relationship between information and data models, please refer to
   [RFC3444].

   In order to capture information that is specific to different network
   topology types, this document defines an abstract (basic) topology
   model that can be extended and adapted.  As a result, the information
   model is generic in nature and can be applied to many network
   topologies.  Applications can operate on any topology at a generic
   level where specifics of particular topology types are not required,
   and at a topology-specific level when those specifics come into play.
   Specific topology types that are covered in this document include
   Layer 3 Unicast IGP, IS-IS, and OSPF.  We also define the information
   model for traffic engineering (TE) data.  Adaptations and extensions
   to other types of topologies (such as Layer 2 topology or OpenFlow
   topology) are possible, using similar model patterns to the ones that
   are illustrated.

   This revision of the document focuses on the "live" topology
   information model ([I-D.amante-i2rs-topology-use-cases],
   Section 3.2).  The "inventory" and "statistics collection"
   information models will be addressed separately.

   The information model contains several components:

   Network-Topology  contains a generic network topology model.  It
      defines a network topology at its most general level of
      abstraction.  It models aspects such as nodes and edges that
      constitute a topology graph, as well as termination points
      contained in the nodes that actually terminate edges of the graph.
      A network can contain multiple topologies, for example topologies
      at different network layers or overlay topologies.  The model
      therefore allows to show relationships between topologies, as well
      as dependencies between nodes and termination points across
      topologies.

   L3-Unicast-IGP-Topology  applies the general network topology model
      to Layer 3 Unicast IGP topologies.  It extends the general
      topology with information specific to Layer 3 Unicast IGP.  In
      doing so, it also illustrates the extension patterns associated
      with extending respectively extending the general topology model
      to meet the needs of a specific topology.

   OSPF-Topology  Module "ospf-topology" defines a topology model for
      OSPF, building on and extending the Layer 3 Unicast IGP topology
      model.  It serves as an example of how the general topology model
      can be refined across multiple levels.

   IS-IS-Topology  defines a topology model for IS-IS, again building on
      and extending the Layer 3 Unicast IGP topology model.

   TED  defines information kept in the Traffic Engineering Database
      (TED) that is leveraged by IS-IS and OSPF topologies.

   This section provides an overview of the network topology model.  We
   start with the structure of the foundational model that represents a
   generic topology.  Subsequently, an overview of selected specific
   topologies is given - Layer 3 Unicast IGP, OSPF, and IS-IS,
   respectively.  Throughout the document, selected design choices are
   explained and the pattern that should be applied to extend the model
   to new types of topologies is presented.

   The network topology model is defined by the following components,
   whose relationship is roughly depicted in the figure below.

                     Figure 1: Overall model structure

   The Network-Topology component defines the basic network topology
   model.  The L3-Unicast-Topology module extends this model with
   additional definitions needed to represent Layer 3 Unicast IGP
   topologies.  This component in turn is extended by OSPF-Topology and
   ISIS-Topology components providing additional definitions for OSPF
   and IS-IS topologies, respectively.  The TED component, used by both
   OSPF-Topology and ISIS-Topology components, contains a set of
   auxiliary definitions related to traffic engineering.

4.  Network Topology Information Model

   This section specifies the network topology information model in
   Routing Backus-Naur Form (RBNF, [RFC5511]).  It also provides
   diagrams of the main entities that the information model is comprised
   of.

   The following diagram contains an informal graphical depiction of the
   main elements of the information model:

                                 +----------------+
                                 |    topology    |<...

                           +--------+


   Roughly speaking, the basic information model works as follows: A
   topology contains nodes and links.  Each node in turn contains
   termination points.  A link connects two nodes (a source and a
   destination), terminating on each at a termination point.  Nodes can
   map onto and be supported by other nodes, while links can map onto
   and be supported by other links.  Topologies can map onto other,
   underlay topologies.

   The information model for the Network-Topology component is more
   formally shown in the following diagram.

   The elements of the Network-Topology information model are as
   follows:

   o  A network can contain multiple topologies.  Each topology is
      captured in its own list element, distinguished via a topology-id.



Medved, et al.          Expires January 16, 2014                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    draft-medved-i2rs-topology-im-00.txt         July 2013


   o  A topology has a certain type, such as OSPF or IS-IS.  A topology
      can even have multiple types simultaneously.  The type, or types,
      are captured in the list of "topology-type" components.

   o  A topology can in turn be part of a hierarchy of topologies,
      building on top of other topologies.  Any such topologies are
      captured in list "underlay-topology".

   o  Furthermore, a topology contains nodes and links, each captured in
      their own list.

   o  A node has a node-id.  This distinguishes the node from other
      nodes in the list.  In addition, a node has a list of termination
      points, used to terminate links.  An examples of a termination
      point might be a physical or logical port or, more generally, an
      interface.  Also, a node can in turn map onto other nodes in an
      underlay topology.  This is captured in list "supporting-node".

   o  A link is identified by a link-id, uniquely identifying the link
      within the topology.  Links are point-to-point and unidirectional.
      Accordingly, a link contains a source and a destination.  Both
      source and destination reference a corresponding node, as well as
      a termination point on that node.  Analogous to a node, a link can
      in turn map onto other links an underlay topology.  This is
      captured in list "supporting-link".

   o  The topology, node and link elements can be extended with
      topology-specific components (topology-extensions, node-extension
      and link-extension, respectively).  This document defines
      extensions for the L3 unicast topology.

   The topology model includes links that are point-to-point and
   unidirectional.  It does not directly support multipoint and
   bidirectional links.  While this may appear as a limitation, it does
   keep the model simple, generic, and allows it to very easily be
   subjected applications that make use of graph algorithms.  Bi-
   directional connections can be represented through pairs of
   unidirectional links.  By introducing hierarchies of nodes, with
   nodes at one level mapping onto a set of other nodes at another
   level, and the introducing new links for nodes at that level,
   topologies with connections representing non-point-to-point
   communication patterns can be represented.

   To minimize assumptions of what a topology might actually represent,
   mappings between topologies, nodes, links, and termination points are
   kept strictly generic.  For example, no assumptions are made whether
   a termination point actually refers to an interface, or whether a
   node refers to a specific "system" or device; the model at this

Internet-Draft    draft-medved-i2rs-topology-im-00.txt         July 2013


   generic level makes no provisions for that.  Any greater specifics
   about mappings between upper and lower layers can be captured in
   extending modules.

   Links are terminated by a single termination point, not sets of
   termination points.  Connections involving multihoming or link
   aggregation schemes need to be modeled using multiple point-to-point
   links, then define a link at a higher layer that is supported by
   those individual links.

   In a hierarchy of topologies, there are nodes mapping to nodes, links
   mapping to links, and termination points mapping to termination
   points.  Some of this information is redundant.  Specifically, with
   the link-to-links mapping known, and the termination points of each
   link known, maintaining separate termination point mapping
   information is not needed but can be derived via transitive closure.

4.2.  Layer 3 Unicast Topology (IGP) Extensions

4.2.1.  The L3-Unicast-Topology Component

   In order to represent a general Layer 3 Unicast IGP topology, the
   basic network topology model needs to be extended.  The corresponding
   extensions are introduced in a component, whose structure is
   informally depicted in the following diagram.

   Roughly speaking, layer 3 IGP topology refines the generic topology,
   and layer 3 IGP nodes, IGP links, and IGP termination points (not
   depicted) refine the generic nodes, links, and termination points.
   In addition, layer 3 IGP nodes can contain prefixes.  The pattern
   recurses with OSPF and IS-IS topologies, which are in turn derived
   from the corresponding layer 3 IGP entities.

   A more formal depiction in RBNF format follows below:

      <igp-topology> ::= <TOPOLOGY_NAME>
                         [(<FLAGS>...)]
                         [(<ospf-topology> | <isis-topology>)]

      <igp-node> ::= <NODE_NAME>
                     (<router-id>...)
                     [(<prefix>...)]
                     [(<FLAGS>...)]
                     [(<isis-node> | <ospf-node>)]

      <router-id> ::= <ip-address> | <NUMBER>

      <ip-address> ::= (<IPV4><IPV4_ADDRESS>) | (<IPV6><IPV6_ADDRESS>)

      <prefix> ::= <ip-route>
                   <METRIC>
                   (<FLAGS>...)
                   [(<ospf-prefix> | <isis-prefix>)]

      <ip-route> ::= <ip-address>
                     <PREFIX_LENGTH>

      <igp-link> ::= <LINK_NAME>
                     <METRIC>
                     [(<FLAGS>...)]
                     [ (<isis-link> |<ospf-link>) ]

      <igp-termination-point> ::= (<ip-address>...) | <NUMBER>


   The model extends the original network-topology model as follows:

   o  A new topology type is introduced, igp-topology.

Internet-Draft    draft-medved-i2rs-topology-im-00.txt         July 2013


   o  Additional topology attributes are introduced.  This allows to
      introduce additional flags in extending modules that are
      associated with specific IGP topologies, without needing to revise
      this component.

   o  Additional data objects for nodes are introduced by extending the
      "node" list of the network topology module.  New objects include
      again a set of flags, as well as a list of prefixes.  Each prefix
      in turn includes an ip prefix, a metric, and a prefix-specific set
      of flags.

   o  Links are extended as well with a set of parameters, allowing to
      associate a link with an IGP name, another set of flags, and a
      link metric.

4.2.2.  The OSPF-Topology Component

   OSPF is the next type of topology represented in the model.  OSPF
   represents a particular type of Layer 3 Unicast IGP.  Accordingly,
   the Layer 3 Unicast IGP topology model needs to be extended.  The
   corresponding extensions are introduced in a separate component
   "ospf-topology", whose structure is depicted in the following
   diagram.  For the most part, this module extends the "l3-unicast-igp-
   topology" component.

      <ospf-topology> ::= <AREA_IDENTIFIER>

      <ospf-node> ::= <ospf-router-type>
                      [<DR_INTERFACE_IDENTIFIER>]
                      [(<MUTLI_TOPOLOGY_IDENTIFIER>...)]
                      [<ospf-node-capabilities>]
                      [<ted-node>]

      <ospf-router-type> ::= <ABR> | <ASBR> | <INTERNAL> | <PSEUDONODE>

      <ospf-node-capabilities> ::= <>

      <ospf-link> ::= [<MULTI_TOPOLOGY_IDENTIFIER>]
                      [<ted-link>]

      <ospf-prefix> ::= [<forwarding-address>]

      <forwarding-address> ::= <IPV4><IPV4_ADDRESS>


   The module extends the l3-unicast-igp-topology as follows:

   o  A new topology type is introduced, ospf-topology-type.

Internet-Draft    draft-medved-i2rs-topology-im-00.txt         July 2013


   o  Additional topology attributes are introduced, which extend the
      igp-topology-attributes of the l3-unicast-igp-topology component.
      The attributes include an OSPF area-id identifying the area.

   o  Additional data objects for nodes are introduced by extending the
      igp-node-attributes of the l3-unicast-igp-topology component.  New
      objects include router-type, de-interface-id for pseudonodes, list
      of multi-topology-ids, OSPF node capabilities and traffic
      engineering attributes.

   o  Links are extended with multi-topology-id and traffic engineering
      link attributes.

   o  Prefixes are extended with OSPF specific forwarding address.

4.2.3.  The IS-IS-Topology Component

   IS-IS is another type of Layer 3 Unicast IGP.  Like OSPF topology,
   IS-IS topology is defined in a separate component, "isis-topology",
   which extends "l3-unicast-igp-topology".

         <isis-topology> ::= <NET_IDENTIFIER>

         <isis-node> ::= <isis-router-type> <iso>
                         (<NET_IDENTIFIER>...)
                         [(<MULTI_TOPOLOGY_IDENTIFIER>...)]
                         [<ted-node>]

         <iso> ::= <ISO_SYSTEM_ID> <ISO_PSEUDONODE_ID>
         <isis-router-type> ::= <LEVEL_2> | <LEVEL_1> | <LEVEL_2_1>

         <isis-link> ::= [<MULTI_TOPOLOGY_IDENTIFIER>]
                         [<ted-link>]

         <isis-prefix> ::= <>


   The module extends the l3-unicast-igp-topology component as follows:

   o  A new topology type is introduced, "isis-topology-type".

   o  Additional topology attributes are introduced.  The attributes
      include an ISIS NET-id identifying the area.

   o  Additional data objects for nodes are introduced by extending
      "igp-node-attributes" of the l3-unicast-igp-topology component.
      New objects include router-type, iso-system-id to identify the
      router, list of multi-topology-id, list of NET ids and traffic
      engineering attributes.

   o  Links are extended with multi-topology-id and traffic engineering
      link attributes.

   In addition, the module extends IGP node and link with ISIS
   attributes.

4.2.4.  The TED (Traffic Engineering Data) Component

   Traffic Engineering Data is required both by OSPF and IS-IS, which
   are defined in separate components.  Information shared by both is
   defined in another component, "TED".  This component defines a set of
   groupings with auxiliary information required and shared by those
   other components.

      <ted-node> ::= <te-router-id>
                     <local-address>
                     <pcc-capabilities>

      <te-router-id> ::= [<IPV4><IPV4_ADDRESS>]
                         [<IPV6><IPV6_ADDRESS>]

      <local-address> ::= [((<IPV4><IPV4_ADDRESS>)...)] |
                          [((<IPV6><IPV6_ADDRESS><PREFIX_OPTION>)...)]

      <pcc-capabilities> ::= <>

      <ted-link> ::= <COLOR>
                     <MAX_LINK_BANDWIDTH>
                     <MAX_RESV_LINK_BANDWIDTH>
                     (<UNRESERVED_BANDWIDTH>...)
                     <TE_DEFAULT_METRIC>
                     [<srlg-attributes>]

      <srlg-attributes> ::= ( <interface-switching-capabilities>...)
                            (<SRLG_VALUE>...)
                            <LINK_PROTECTION_TYPE>

      <interface-switching-capabilities> ::= <switching-capabilities>
                                             <ENCODING>
                                             (<MAX_LSP_BANDWIDTH>...)
                                             [<packet-switch-capable>]
                                             [<tdm-capable>]

   This module details traffic-engineering node and link attributes:

   o  TED node attributes include te-router-id for IPv4 and IPv6, local
      IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and path computation client capabilities.
      The path computation client capabilities in turn include a bit
      vector for various path computation capabilities.

   o  TED link attributes comprise link color, max-link-bandwidth, max-
      resv-link-bandwidth, unreserved bandwidth and re-metric.  They
      also include SRLG attributes which contains interface switching
      capabilities, a list of SRLG values and link protection type.  The
      interface switching capabilities in turn contains switching
      capability, encoding, max-lsp-bandwidth and interface switching
      specific attributes.
