    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Various solutions (e.g., <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-softwire-mesh-multicast"></xref>, <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast"></xref>) have been proposed
      to allow access to IPv4 multicast content from hosts attached to
      IPv6-enabled domains. Even if these solutions have distinct
      applicability scopes (translation vs. encapsulation) and target
      different use cases, they all make use of specific IPv6 multicast
      addresses to embed an IPv4 multicast address. Particularly, the
      IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address is used as a destination IPv6
      address of multicast flows received from an IPv4-enabled domain and
      injected by the IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection Function into an IPv6-enabled
      domain. It is also used to build an IPv6 multicast state (*, G6) or (S6,
      G6) corresponding to their (*, G4) or (S4, G4) IPv4 counter parts by the
      IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection Function. <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-mboned-v4v6-mcast-ps"></xref> provides more discussion
      about issues related to IPv4/IPv6 multicast.</t>

      <t>This document specifies an extension to the IPv6 multicast addressing
      architecture to be used in the context of IPv4-IPv6 interconnection. In
      particular, this document defines an address format for IPv4-embedded
      IPv6 multicast addresses. This address format can be used for IPv4-IPv6
      translation or encapsulation schemes.</t>

      <t>This document updates <xref target="RFC4291"></xref>. A new M-bit is
      defined; if set to "1", it indicates an IPv4 multicast address is
      embedded in the low-order 32 bits of the IPv6 multicast address. <xref
      target="justification"></xref> enumerates the arguments in favor of
      defining an address format while <xref target="mbit"></xref> discusses
      why identifying an IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address is needed.</t>

      <t>This specification can be used in conjunction with other extensions
      such as building unicast prefix-based multicast IPv6 address <xref
      target="RFC3306"></xref> or embedding the rendezvous point <xref
      target="RFC3956"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This document is a companion document to <xref
      target="RFC6052"></xref> which focuses exclusively on IPv4-embedded IPv6
      unicast addresses.</t>

      <t>Details about design choices are documented in <xref
      target="design"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>This document makes use of the following terms:<?rfc subcompact="no" ?><list
          style="symbols">
          <t>IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address: denotes a multicast IPv6
          address which includes in 32 bits an IPv4 address. Two types of IPv6
          addresses are defined that carry an IPv4 address in the low-order 32
          bits of the address. The format to build such addresses is defined
          in <xref target="format_asm"></xref> for Any Source Multicast (ASM)
          mode and <xref target="format_ssm"></xref> for Source Specific
          Multicast (SSM) mode.</t>

          <t>Multicast Prefix64 (or MPREFIX64 for short) refers to an IPv6
          multicast prefix to be used to construct IPv4-embedded IPv6
          multicast addresses. This prefix is used to build an IPv4-embedded
          IPv6 multicast address as defined in <xref target="algo"></xref>.
          <xref target="algo"></xref> specifies also how to extract an IPv4
          address from an IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address.</t>

          <t>ASM_MPREFIX64: denotes a multicast Prefix64 used in ASM mode. It
          follows the format described in <xref
          target="format_asm"></xref>.</t>

          <t>SSM_MPREFIX64: denotes a multicast Prefix64 used in SSM mode. It
          follows the format described in <xref
          target="format_ssm"></xref>.</t>

          <t>IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection Function: refers to a function which is
          enabled in a node interconnecting an IPv4-enabled domain with an
          IPv6-enabled one. It can be located in various places of the
          multicast network. Particularly, in terms of multicast control
          messages, it can be an IGMP/MLD Interworking Function or an
          IPv4-IPv6 PIM Interworking Function. An IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection
          Function is configured with one or two MPREFIX64s.</t>

               title="Why an Address Format is Needed for Multicast IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection?">
        <t>Arguments why an IPv6 address format is needed to embed multicast
        IPv4 address are quite similar to those of <xref
        target="RFC6052"></xref>. Concretely, the definition of a multicast
        address format embedding a multicast IPv4 address allows:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Stateless IPv4-IPv6 header translation of multicast flows;</t>

            <t>Stateless IPv4-IPv6 PIM interworking function;</t>

            <t>Stateless IGMP-MLD interworking function (e.g., required for an
            IPv4 receiver to access to IPv4 multicast content via an IPv6
            network);</t>

            <t>Stateless (local) synthesis of IPv6 address when IPv4 multicast
            address are embedded in application payload (e.g., SDP <xref
            target="RFC4566"></xref>);</t>

            <t>Except the provisioning of the same MPREFIX64, no coordination
            is required between IPv4-IPv6 PIM interworking function, IGMP-MLD
            interworking function, IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection Function and any
            ALG (Application Level Gateway) in the path;</t>

            <t>Minimal operational constraints on the multicast address
            management: IPv6 multicast addresses can be constructed using what
            has been deployed for IPv4 delivery mode.</t>

               title="Why Identifying an IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Multicast Address is Required?">
        <t>Reserving an M-bit in the IPv6 multicast address (which is
        equivalent to reserving a dedicated multicast block for IPv4-IPv6
        interconnection purposes) is a means to guide the address selection
        process at the receiver side; in particular it assists the receiver to
        select the appropriate IP multicast address while avoiding to involve
        an IPv4-IPv6 interconnection function in the path.</t>

        <t>Two use cases to illustrate this behavior are provided below:<list
            style="numbers">
            <t>An ALG is required to help an IPv6 receiver to select the
            appropriate IP address when only the IPv4 address is advertised
            (e.g., using SDP); otherwise the access to the IPv4 multicast
            content can not be offered to the IPv6 receiver. The ALG may be
            located downstream the receiver. As such, the ALG does not know in
            advance whether the receiver is dual-stack or IPv6-only. The ALG
            may be tuned to insert both the original IPv4 address and
            corresponding IPv6 multicast address. If the M-bit is not used, a
            dual-stack receiver may prefer to use the IPv6 address to receive
            the multicast content. This address selection would require
            multicast flows to cross an IPv4-IPv6 interconnection
            function.</t>

            <t>In order to avoid involving an ALG in the path, an IPv4-only
            source can advertise both its IPv4 address and IPv4-embedded IPv6
            multicast address. If the M-bit is not used, a dual-stack receiver
            may prefer to use the IPv6 address to receive the multicast
            content. This address selection would require multicast flows to
            cross an IPv4-IPv6 interconnection function.</t>
          </list>Reserving an M-bit in the IPv6 multicast address for
        IPv4-IPv6 interconnection purposes mitigates the issues discussed in
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-nat64-learn-analysis"></xref> in a
        multicast context.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Location of the IPv4 Address">
        <t>There is no strong argument to allow for flexible options to encode
        the IPv4 address inside the multicast IPv6 address. The option
        retained by the authors is to encode the multicast IPv4 address in the
        low-order 32 bits of the IPv6 address.</t>

        <t>This choice is also motivated by the need to be compliant with
        <xref target="RFC3306"></xref> and <xref target="RFC3956"></xref>.</t>

        <t>It was tempting to use the remaining flag to indicate whether an
        IPv6 address embeds an IPv4 address or not. This choice has been
        abandoned by the authors for various reasons: <?rfc subcompact="yes" ?><list
            style="symbols">
            <t>ff3x::/32 is defined as SSM. Defining a new flag would require
            standards and implementations to also treat ffbx::/32 as SSM.</t>

            <t>Prefixes starting with ff7x are defined as embedded-RP, but not
            prefixes starting with fffx. Below is provided an excerpt from
            <xref target="RFC3956"></xref>: <list style="empty">
                <t>" ...the encoding and the protocol mode used when the two
                high-order bits in "flgs" are set to 11 ("fff0::/12") is
                intentionally unspecified until such time that the
                highest-order bit is defined. Without further IETF
                specification, implementations SHOULD NOT treat the fff0::/12
                range as Embedded-RP."</t>

                <t>as such defining a new flag would require implementations
                to also treat ff7x::/12 as embedded-RP prefix.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>This is the last remaining flag and at this stage we are not
            sure whether there is other usage scenarios of the flag.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>As a conclusion, the remaining flag is not used to indicate an IPv6
        multicast address embeds an IPv4 multicast address. However the
        following constraints should be met:<?rfc subcompact="yes" ?></t>

        <t><list style="empty">
            <t>(1) Belong to ff3x::/32 and be compatible with unicast-based
            prefix <xref target="RFC3306"></xref> for SSM. Note that <xref
            target="RFC3306"></xref> suggests to set "plen" to 0 and
            "network-prefix" to 0.</t>

            <t>(2) Be compatible with embedded-RP <xref
            target="RFC3956"></xref> and unicast-based prefix <xref
            target="RFC3306"></xref> for ASM;</t>

            <t>(3) Avoid ff3x::4000:0001-ff3x::7fff:ffff which is reserved for
            IANA.</t>
          </list>Meeting (1) and (2) with the same location of the M-bit is
        not feasible without modifying embedded-RP and unicast-based prefix
        specifications; this option is avoided.</t>

        <t>As a consequence, two multicast blocks are proposed to be used when
        embedding IPv4 address: one block for ASM (<xref
        target="format_asm"></xref> ) and another one for the SSM (<xref
        target="format_ssm"></xref>).</t>

      <section anchor="why_s_bit" title="Encapsulation vs. Translation">
        <t>IPv4-IPv6 encapsulator and translator may be embedded in the same
        device or even implemented with the same software module. In order to
        help the function whether an encapsulated IPv6 multicast packets or
        translated IPv6 ones are to be transferred. It was tempting to define
        an S-bit for that purpose but this choice has been abandoned in favor
        of the recommendation to use distinct MPREFIX64 for each scheme.</t>

        <t>As such, there is no need to reserve a bit in the IPv6 multicast
        address to separate between the translation and the encapsulation
        schemes.</t>
