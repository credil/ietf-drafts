   Each entry in the diagram (e.g.  "Root CA") represents a function of
   the Web PKI.  Each function imports and verifies credentials from the
   function directly below it and (in some cases) exports a certificate
   containing the credential.

   Vertical cardinality (represented by a down arrow) indicates
   recursive depth, whereas horizontal cardinality (represented by a
   right arrow) indicates selection breadth.

   The boxes delineate the boundaries of distinct entities (e.g. arms-
   length businesses or natural persons), example names for which appear
   underlined in the top lefthand corner of the box.

   Where boxes appear overlaid ( "Issuing CA" and "Registration
   Authority"), it indicates that the function is the responsibility of
   the overlying entity, but it is hosted by the underlying entity.


2.  Basic trust model

   The basic server-authentication trust model is shown in Figure 2.

   management authority by choosing to use a particular certificate-
   using product.  However, some product suppliers adopt the policies of
   other suppliers by copying their root store, without seeking
   independent evidence of conformance.

   All functions of the commercial CA are subject to the audit process
   prescribed by the policy management authority.

   If the roles of the unaffiliated user and the Web site operator were
   to be reversed, then the figure would depict the use of the Web PKI
   for client authentication.


3.  Trust model variants

   There are several variants of the basic trust model in common use.

3.1.  Client application uses OS root store

   The situation is shown in Figure 3.

   | Policy Management Authority   v           -> 1..many    |
   |---------------------------------------------------------|
   | Commercial CA                                           |
   | -------------                                           |

   |---------------------------------------------------------|

   root store.  Instead, it uses the platform operating system root
   store and certificate processing functions to validate the
   certificate-holder's certificate.  It may then apply additional
   checks, such as checking that the certificate subject's domain name
   matches that requested by the certificate user.

3.2.  Subscriber certificates issued by root CA

   Some legacy situations demand that the certificate-holder certificate
   be issued directly by the root CA, without the involvement of
   intermediate or issuing CAs, see Figure 4.  This model is now
   deprecated, but the practice will remain in effect indefinitely.

        Figure 4: Certificate holder certificate issued by root CA

3.3.  One root CA cross-certifies another root CA

   A small but significant portion of the certificate-using products in
   active use does not possess the capability to be updated in the
   field.  Consequently, these products do not accept certificates
   issued by CAs that came into existence after they were deployed.
   Although their certificates are accepted by newer products and ones
   that can be updated in the field, newer CAs operate at a disadvantage
   to older CAs, and they commonly address this disadvantage by having
   their public key cross-certified by an older CA.  See Figure 5.

              Figure 5: One root CA certifies another root CA

   Because the cross-certified root CA is recognized directly by a
   policy management authority, it operates in accordance with the
   requirements of that policy management authority, regardless of any
   requirements placed upon it by the contract between it and the cross-
   certifying root CA.

3.4.  Issuing CA is an affiliate

   The issuing CA may operate at arms-length to the root CA, as shown in
   Figure 6.

                   Figure 7: RA affiliated to issuing CA

   The affiliate's behavior is governed by its contract with the issuing
   CA.  The issuing CA commonly performs a subset of the checks normally
   performed by the registration authority, such as identifying
   unacceptable names.

3.6.  The root CA is operated by a government

   In the case where the root CA is operated by a government department,
   the policy authority may relax the requirement for a fully-
   independent third-party audit, relying instead upon an audit
   conducted in accordance with the government's own internal audit
   process.

3.7.  The certificate user directly trusts an issuing CA

   Certificate user products may allow the user to designate a CA key as
   trusted, a priori, for the purpose of validating certificate-holder
   certificates.  See Figure 8.

   contract.  See Figure 10.

   The root CA may use the PKIX name constraints certificate extension
   to limit the region of name-space in which the issuing CA can issue
   valid certificates.

   A root CA may host an issuing CA on behalf of a certificate holder.
   Typically, the certificate holder is approved to issue certificates
   only within a specific region of the name-space, and this limitation
   is enforced by the host root CA.  Examination of the certificate path
   indicates that the issuing CA was owned and operated by the
   certificate holder.  See Figure 11.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


5.  Security Considerations

   The trust models described here exhibit several vulnerabilities that
   could adversely affect the reliability of the authentication they
   provide.  The first concerns the naming of certificate holders.  The
   second concerns controllability and observability of issued
   certificates.

   Certificate holder names with any of the following characteristics
   can be used in an impersonation attack.

   o  homographic name

   o  mixed-alphabet name

   o  name that contains a string termination character

   o  non-unique name (e.g. an internal server name)

   With the exception of non-unique names, CAs in the Web PKI are
   required to screen out requests for certificates with these
   characteristics.  CAs are required to phase out the practice of
   issuing non-unique names by 2016.

   Technically, unless constrained by an upstream CA to issue
   certificates only in a specific region of the name-space, any CA in
   the Web PKI can issue an apparently legitimate certificate for any
   name, whether or not the legitimate holder of that name is aware of,
   or approves, the issuance.  Furthermore, the legitimate holder of
   that name may not discover that such a certificate has been issued.

   In the event of a compromise of a root CA, its key is blacklisted by
   certificate-user products by means of a software update.  This has
   the effect of invalidating every otherwise-valid certificate that
   chains to that root, whether or not it was issued while the
   compromise existed.  This clearly has a severe impact upon the CA and
   its certificate holders; a step not likely to be taken without very
   careful deliberation and (perhaps) hesitation.
