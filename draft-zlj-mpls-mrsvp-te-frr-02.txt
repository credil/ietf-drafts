Fast Reroute Extensions to Receiver-Driven RSVP-TE for Multicast Tunnels
                   draft-zlj-mpls-mrsvp-te-frr-02.txt

Abstract

   This document specifies fast reroute procedures to protect multicast
   LSP tunnels built by mRSVP-TE, a receiver-driven extension to RSVP-TE
   specified by [I-D.draft-lzj-mpls-receiver-driven-multicast-rsvp-te].
   This document is motivated by the observation that the existing FRR
   solution specified by [RFC4090] and [RFC4875] for the sender-driven
   RSVP-TE is no longer applicable to the receiver-driven RSVP-TE.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC-
   WORDS].  The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology in
   [RSVP], [RSVP-TE] and [mRSVP-TE].

   This document uses same terminologies stated in
   [I-D.draft-lzj-mpls-receiver-driven-multicast-rsvp-te], [RFC4090] and
   [RFC4875].  In addition, some key notions and terminologies for this
   document are explained as follows:

   o  mLSP, Multicast Label Switched Path, is either a P2MP or MP2MP LSP
      consisting of one or more sub-LSPs.

   o  mRSVP-TE, Multicast Resource Reservation Protocol-Traffic
      Engineering, is used to distinguish from the regular sender-driven
      RSVP-TE.  One major difference between RSVP-TE and mRSVP-TE is
      that the tunnel setup is initiated by the data receiver instead of
      the data sender.

   o  PLR: Point of Local Repair, an LSR that detects a local failure
      event and redirects traffic from protected mLSP to a backup mLSP
      tunnel which is designed to take over traffic forwarding until the
      protected tunnel is repaired.

   o  MP: Merge Point, an LSR that merges the traffic from backup
      tunnels with primary LSP at the level of forwarding plane.  In the
      receiver-driven RSVP-TE for approach, the MP is the LSR that
      initiates backup mLSP setup taking PLR as the root of the backup
      LSP.

   o  N: The node to be protected.

   o  Pn: The node(s) on the backup path for protecting node N.

   o  Root: A router where an mLSP is rooted at.  Multicast contents
      enter the root and then are distributed to leaf routers along the
      P2MP/MP2MP LSP.

   o  FRR Domain: A set of links and LSRs that compose a protected sub-
      LSP and backup LSP, and which is located between PLR and MP(s).

2.  Introduction

   Fast Reroute technology has been well accepted and deployed to
   provide millisecond-level protection in case of node/link failures.
   FRR employs some local repair mechanisms to meet the fast reroute
   requirements by computing and provisioning backup tunnels in advance
   of failure and by redirecting traffic to such backup tunnels as close
   to the failure point as possible.

   The fast reroute extensions to RSVP-TE are specified in [RFC4090] and
   [RFC4875].  Such extensions work well with the sender-driven RSVP-TE,
   but they are no longer applicable to the receiver-driven RSVP-TE for
   multicast tunnels described in the draft
   [I-D.draft-lzj-mpls-receiver-driven-multicast-rsvp-te].

   In the receiver-driven paradigm of mRSVP-TE, the procedure to set up
   an LSP tunnel is inverted from that in the sender-driven RSVP-TE, and
   thus the backup mLSP setup and failover handling mechanism will have
   to be different from what has been specified for the sender-driven
   RSVP-TE.  From the signaling point of view, the behavior of PLR and
   MR is inverted from the sender-driven paradigm of RSVP-TE: the setup
   for a backup mLSP is initiated by MP with PLR being taken as the root
   of a P2MP/MP2MP tree.  The RSVP PATH message is sent from MP towards
   PLR with the FAST_REROUT, DETOUR as well as other FRR related objects
   conveyed in the PATH message.  RSVP RESV message is sent from PLR
   towards MP carrying FRR information such as the inner label used to
   represent a protected mLSP tunnel, etc.

   On the other hand, from the packet forwarding point of view, the
   behavior of PLR and MP is similar to the sender-driven RSVP-TE.  The
   traffic switchover and redirecting are still initiated by PLR, and
   the data traffic is merged at MP in the same way as what is specified
   for the sender-driven RSVP-TE.

   This document describes various FRR protection methods and behavior
   changes for the receiver-driven mRSVP-TE, and specify fast-reroute
   extensions to the RSVP-TE messages, mechanisms and procedures
   specified in the mRSVP-TE draft
   [I-D.draft-lzj-mpls-receiver-driven-multicast-rsvp-te].

2.1.  Link Protection and Node Protection with mRSVP-TE

   FRR link protection aims to protect a direct link between two LSRs
   (Label Switch Routers).  An LSR at one end of the link is called PLR
   (Point of Local Repair), and the other LSR located at the other end
   of the link is called MP (Merge Point).  A backup LSP whose setup is
   originated at MP and terminated at PLR will be established to protect
   the primary LSP crossing over the link.  The LSRs over the backup

   path are called Pn.  These connected LSRs and links are called an FRR
   domain in this document.  An example of an FRR domain supporting link
   protection is shown in Figure 1.

                    Figure 1: Basic FRR Link Protection

   In an FRR domain constructed by mRSVP-TE, the MP initiates both the
   primary and the backup LSP setup at the signaling control plane, and
   merges the traffic from the backup LSP into the primary LSP at the
   data forwarding plane.  The PLR works with the MP to set up LSP at
   the signaling control plane accordingly, and detects link failure and
   initiates local repair at the data forwarding plane.  In Figure 1, we
   use hyphens (-)to denote a primary tunnel between LSRs; and asterisks
   (*) to denote a backup tunnel.  The same symbols will be applied to
   all figures throughout the document.

   Node protection is a technique used to protect a node N that resides
   between PLR and MP over a primary LSP.  An example of node protection
   is shown in Figure 2.

   N (R2) denotes a node being protected over a primary LSP, its
   upstream node plays the role of PLR while the downstream node plays
   the role of MP.  Pn denotes a transit node over its backup LSP.  Note
   that there can be multiple Pn's over a backup tunnel.  Pn does not
   play a significant role for FRR but works as a regular LSR to receive
   and transmit multicast data and signaling messages over backup LSPs.

   Besides the basic P2P node protection, mRSVP-TE suggests P2MP and
   MP2MP node protection as shown in Figures 3 and 4.  Because the same
   protection mechanism can be commonly used for both P2MP and MP2MP,
   this document uses P2MP as example for the discussion, and mention
   MP2MP only if there is a difference from P2MP.

   There are two typical methods to protect a P2MP multicast tree, one
   that uses a P2MP tree as a backup LSP to protect a primary mLSP (see
   Figure 3), and the other that uses multiple P2P LSPs to protect a
   P2MP mLSP(see Figure 4).

2.2.  Primary and Backup LSP

   A router that detects a node/link failure must have pre-determined
   which alternate reroute path it should use to forward traffic while
   the failure is being fixed.  The alternate backup path should be
   established before a protected LSP is broken.  Anything such as
   backup route computation and configuration required for local repair
   purposes should be done prior to failure occurrence so that the
   failover time can be reduced to minimum.

   On the control plane, the backup LSP will be set up along with its
   primary LSP setup.  The PATH/RESV refresh messages are transmitted
   over both protected and backup LSPs before failover.  However on the
   data plane, there are two implementation options for traffic
   forwarding.  One option is that traffic is not forwarded on backup
   LSP tunnel until a failure is detected and the local repair takes
   place.  The second option is to forward traffic on both protected and
   backup mLSPs before failover, and the LSR at Merge Point will then
   drop packets coming from the backup path before switchover.  The
   second option can further reduce traffic switchover time at the cost
   of extra overhead and bandwidth sub-optimization.  This document
   leaves the flexibility for implementation to decide which option to
   choose, but will use the first option for the discussion, i.e. we
   assume that the traffic is forwarded on the primary LSP only before
   switchover.

2.3.  Detour Backup and Facility Backup

   Due to historical reasons and implementation preferences, two
   independent methods for doing fast reroute have been developed.  One
   backup method is called detour backup and is especially designed for

   1:1 protection.  The other one is called facility backup and is
   especially designed for 1: N protection, where N can be equal to or
   greater than 1.  From the point of view of applications, the facility
   backup method can support both 1:N and 1:1, but from the technical
   point of view, these are two different methods requiring different
   implementations with respect to their label stacks when forwarding
   packets.

   The detour backup creates a dedicated LSP to protect an LSP and uses
   a single MPLS label for packet encapsulation; its implementation is
   simpler but consumes more label resources.  The facility backup
   creates a common LSP to protect a set of LSPs that have similar
   backup constraints.  This method takes advantage of MPLS label
   stacking and uses dual-label encapsulation, thus it can save some
   label resources compared to the detour backup method.

   These two solutions have co-existed as options for vendors and
   service providers to choose.  This document will specify both the
   methods applied to mRSVP-TE.  Throughout the document, the detour
   method is used to represent 1:1 protection while the facility method
   is used to represent 1:N protection.  The term "detour LSP" is
   especially used for 1:1 protection while "backup LSP" is used for 1:
   N protection.  Sometimes the latter can be used for both kinds of
   protection schemes when no ambiguity arises.


3.  Detour Backup for mRSVP-TE

   This section specifies mechanisms and procedures for mRSVP-TE fast
   reroute by using the detour backup method.  The term "detour LSP"
   will be used to denote the LSP in the detour mode and the 1:1
   protection scheme.

3.1.  Link Protection in Detour Backup Mode

3.1.1.  Detour LSP Setup Scenario for Link Protection

   A detour LSP setup is initiated by MP along with the setup of the
   protected LSP (Figure 1), which is one of the major differences from
   the procedure stated in [RFC4090] and [RFC4875].  Following the LSP
   setup procedure specified by the draft
   [I-D.draft-lzj-mpls-receiver-driven-multicast-rsvp-te], MP sends RSVP
   PATH messages towards the sender over a primary path.  For link
   protection purpose, both the MP and PLR are directly connected by the
   link being protected, hence the PATH message is sent from the MP to
   the PLR directly upstream.

   The MP is not necessarily the originator of the primary LSP, but is

   the first LSR entering an FRR domain along the primary route.  Once
   the PATH message is sent out by the MP, the MP will check whether
   there is a detour route available for link protection.  The detour
   route calculation can be done by running CSPF on the link state
   database produced by IGP protocols with TE extensions.  There is no
   change required for backup route computation, and the detour LSP
   computation will be based on this assumption.

   If the CSPF stack returns 'no detour route found' after the detour
   calculation, MP will not perform the detour LSP setup.  If at least
   one detour route is found by CSPF stack, MP selects the shortest
   route and initiates the detour LSP setup.  MP considers PLR as the
   end point of the detour LSP and sends a PATH message towards PLR hop-
   by-hop.  In the example of Figure 1, the PATH message will be sent to
   Pn (R3) and then relayed to PLR (R1).

   Upon receipt of the PATH message, the PLR sends back a RESV message
   towards the MP through the Pn(s).  The transit Pn(s) nodes relay the
   PATH/RESV messages without any special process required for the link
   protection.  The detour LSP setup is completed once the RESV message
   is received and processed by the MP.

3.1.2.  Label Allocation for Link Protection

   Because the detour method uses a dedicated backup LSP to protect a
   primary LSP, one-to-one binding can be made for a pair of primary and
   backup LSPs, a single MPLS label encapsulation will be sufficient for
   packet forwarding and local failure repair purpose.  DLA (downstream
   label allocation) can be used as the label assignment method over the
   detour tunnel for the link protection.  With mRSVP-TE, a downstream
   label is assigned by an LSR that is sending a PATH message to its
   upstream router, and an upstream label is assigned by an LSR that is
   sending the RESV message to its downstream router.  The label
   allocation, however, is more complicated when the primary LSP is a
   P2MP or MP2MP tree.  A specific upstream label allocation and
   resource preemption method is defined in this document to handle the
   protection of P2MP and MP2MP tree structures.

   An example of the label allocation for link protection in the detour
   mode is provided in Figure 5.  For the sake of readability, we use
   label Lp to represent the label assigned to the primary tunnel, and
   label Lb for the labels assigned to the backup tunnel.  For example,
   Lp2 represent a downstream label assigned for LSR R2 to receive
   incoming data over the primary tunnel.  Lb2 represents a downstream
   label assigned for R2 to receive data over a detour LSP.

                           Lb3->Lb2,MP

       Figure 5: Label Allocation for Link Protection in Detour Mode

   In the example of Figure 5, MP assigns label Lp2 and sends it to PLR
   via the PATH message over the link {MP-PLR} to set up the primary
   LSP.  For the detour route {MP-Pn-PLR}, MP assigns a label Lb2 and
   sends it to Pn via the PATH message.  MP binds label Lp2 with label
   Lb2 for this pair of primary and detour LSPs.  An entry 'Lp2->Lp-pe,
   PE' will be added into MP's FIB to forward packets over the protected
   LSP.  Another entry 'Lb2-> Lp-pe, PE' will be added and used when
   traffic is received from the detour tunnel upon switchover.

   Pn (transit node) on the detour tunnel receives Lb2 from MP.  Pn
   assigns a downstream label Lb3 and sends it to the PLR via a PATH
   message.  Pn will add an entry 'Lb3->Lb2, MP' to its FIB for packet
   forwarding.  Note that Pn is not aware of the primary LSP, so there
   is only one forwarding entry needed in its FIB.

   PLR receives two PATH messages from MP and Pn respectively.  Then it
   binds label Lp2 from the primary LSP with label Lb3 from the detour
   LSP.  The detour LSP ends at PLR while the primary LSP may not end at
   PLR if the PLR is not the root of the P2MP tree.  PLR will allocate a
   downstream label Lp1 and sends it to its upstream router, which is
   outside of the FRR domain in this example, hence not shown in Figure
   5.  There will be two entries added into PLR's FIB: one entry
   'Lp1->Lp2, MP' for the primary traffic forwarding, and another entry
   'Lp1->Lb3, Pn' for the detour traffic forwarding upon failover.

   PLR processes PATH messages from MP and sends RESV messages towards
   MP.  If the primary sub-LSP is part of a RD P2MP tree, PLR will not
   allocate upstream labels for receiving traffic from the downstream
   node (MP or Pn in this example) because traffic is uni-directionally
   forwarded.  If the primary sub-LSP is part of a RD MP2MP tree, PLR
   will allocate an upstream label for receiving traffic from the
   opposite direction, and Pn(s) do the same and allocate upstream label

   for the detour sub-LSP accordingly.  Detour LSP setup is completed
   once MP has received and processed the RESV message originated by
   PLR.  Figures 5 shows the summary of labels allocated and FIB entries
   created on each node in the FRR domain.

3.1.3.  Link Failure Repair in Detour Mode

   Link failure can be detected by, for example, BFD (Bidirectional
   Forwarding Detection, [RFC5880],[RFC5884])along the protected LSP,
   The failure detection algorithm is the same as what is used for the
   sender-driven RSVP-TE.

   Once a link failure is detected by PLR and all switchover criteria
   are met, PLR will redirect the traffic to the detour LSP based on the
   forwarding entry 'Lp1->Lb3, Pn'.  The entry 'Lp1->Lp2, MP' for the
   primary path will be withdrawn.

   Pn works as a normal label switch router and forward MPLS packets to
   MP.  MP receives the packet and figures out that such packets come
   from the detour path, so they will be forwarded to PE based on the
   entry 'Lb2->Lp-pe, PE', in the example of Figure 5.  The detour
   traffic is therefore merged back to the primary LSP towards PE, which
   completes the link failure repairing by detouring and merging the
   traffic.

3.1.4.  Re-convergence after Local Repair

   Routers that do not belong to the FRR domain are not impacted by the
   link failure and local repair.  Traffic is transmitted over a detour
   LSP after a link failure and local repair.  Usually, the detour path
   is not the shortest path so the network will eventually re-converge
   and a new shortest path will be calculated by the MPLS control plane.
   Once a new primary path is determined, the traffic is no longer
   transmitted through the detour LSP and PLR will be notified to tear
   down the detour LSP and clean up its internal LIB.  PLR will send a
   PathTear message to Pn and MP for tearing down the detour LSP and
   release backup labels.  Re-convergence procedure is the same as the
   procedure used for sender-driven RSVP-TE FRR.

3.2.  Node Protection in Detour Backup Mode

3.2.1.  Detour LSP Setup for Node Protection

   The detour LSP setup for the node protection is similar to the link
   protection.  Take Figure 2 as an example, where protected node N
   resides between MP and PLR.  In this case the two sub-links {MP-N}
   and {N-PLR} are also to be protected in addition to the node N
   protection.  It is assumed that the link protection mechanism

Internet-Draft                mRSVP-TE FRR                  January 2013


   described in the previous sub-section is applicable to the sub-link
   protection in this situation.  Hence this section will focus on the
   procedure to handle node protection.  A combined solution for
   providing node protection with link protection can be derived from
   the discussions of section 3.1 and this section.

   For the node protection shown in Figure 2, MP(R3) sends a PATH
   message to N for the primary LSP setup, the primary LSP in the FRR
   domain goes through the route {MP-N-PLR}.  Once the PATH message is
   sent out to N, MP checks whether there is a detour path available for
   node N by using CSPF computation, which would indicate N as a node to
   be avoided on the detour path.  If no detour route is found, MP skips
   the detour LSP setup.  If a detour route is found, MP initiates the
   detour LSP setup and considers PLR as the end-point of the detour
   LSP.  MP sends a PATH message towards PLR over the detour route hop-
   by-hop.  In the example of Figure 2, the detour route is in the order
   of {MP-Pn2-Pn1-PLR}.  Similar to the link protection, PLR sends back
   a RESV message towards MP through Pn(s).  Transit node Pn(s) just
   relay the PATH and RESV messages without any specific node protection
   procedure.  The detour LSP setup is completed once the RESV message
   is received and processed by MP.

   Figure 2 shows a typical example of node protection where N is not a
   branch node; it will be more complicated when N is a branch node that
   is part of a RD P2MP/MP2MP tree structure.  The corresponding
   mechanism is described in section 5.2.2.

3.2.2.  Label Allocation and Binding for Node Protection

   Similar to link protection, node protection uses the single label
   encapsulation and downstream label allocation method in the detour
   backup mode.  An example of the label allocation for node protection
   is provided in Figure 6.

                 Figure 6: Node Protection in Detour Mode

   MP (R3) assigns a label Lp3 for the primary LSP and sends it to node
   N via a PATH message over the protected route {MP-N-PLR}.  N will
   allocate a downstream label Lp2 and sends it to PLR via a PATH
   message.  MP also assigns a label Lb3 for the detour LSP and sends it
   to Pn2 via a PATH message over the detour route {MP-Pn2-Pn1-PLR}.  MP
   binds label Lp3 with label Lb3 for this pair of primary and backup
   LSPs.  An entry 'Lp3->Lp-pe, PE' will be added to MP's FIB for packet
   forwarding over the primary LSP.  Another entry 'Lb3->Lp-pe, PE' will
   be kept in the FIB and used when a failover takes place and traffic
   is redirected to the detour LSP.

   There could be multiple transit nodes Pn(s) along the detour LSP,
   each of which will allocate a downstream label and sends it to its
   upstream router.  Eventually PLR receives the PATH message from the
   protected node N and the transit node Pn1 in this example.  PLR binds
   primary label Lp2 with the detour label Lb4, and adds two entries
   into its FIB: One entry 'Lp1->Lp3, N' for the traffic forwarding over
   the primary LSP, and another entry 'Lp1->Lb4, Pn1' for the traffic
   forwarding over the detour LSP.  An example of the allocated labels
   and FIB entries in the FRR domain are mentioned in Figure 6.

3.2.3.  Node Failure Repair in Detour Mode

   Once the node N failure is detected by PLR, it will redirect the
   traffic from the primary LSP to its detour LSP based on the binding
   and forwarding entry 'Lp1->Lb4, Pn1'.  The traffic is forwarded
   through LSR->Pn1-Pn2->MP.  Eventually, MP will receive packets from
   the detour path.  Consulting its FIB forwarding entry 'Lb3->Lp-pe,
   PE', traffic will then be forwarded to PE in the example of Figure 6,
   so that the detoured traffic gets merged into the primary path.

   The local repair mechanism for the node protection is the same as the
   link protection in the detour mode except that there are two links
   {MP-N} and {N-PLR} to be protected in conjunction with the node N
   protection.  The FRR domain must be configured so that both the link
   and node failure detection methods are specified.  For example, BFD
   needs to be activated between MP abd N, N and PLR, and PLR and MP.
   PLR and MP can be used for either link repair, node repair or both
   depending on the results of BFD detection.

3.2.4.  Re-Convergence after Local Repair

   After a node failure takes place, the network topology will change.
   As a consequence, the network will eventually re-converge and a new
   best path will be computed to establish the primary LSP.  PLR will be
   notified as soon as the new primary LSP is signaled and set up.  PLR

   will send notification messages to Pn1 and MP for tearing down the
   detour LSP and withdraw backup labels.


4.  Facility Backup for mRSVP-TE

   This section specifies mechanisms and procedures for mRSVP-TE fast
   reroute by using the facility backup method.  The term backup LSP
   will be used to denote the LSP in the facility mode for 1: N
   protection.  Note that the term 'detour LSP' is no longer used in
   this section for the Facility backup.

   The backup LSP differs from the detour LSP in that one single backup
   LSP is used to protect multiple primary LSPs.  General speaking, two
   labels will be used for the backup LSP with the inner label being
   used to indicate which primary LSP is being protected.

4.1.  Link Protection in Facility Backup Mode

4.1.1.  Backup LSP Setup for Link Protection

   Similar to the detour LSP setup, MP sends a RSVP PATH message towards
   PLR over the primary route.  Once the PATH message is sent out, MP
   will execute the backup LSP procedures as per the following steps:

   o  Check whether there has been a backup LSP created to protect the
      link between PLR and MP.  If a backup LSP is found, skip the
      further process at MP, e.g., do not send a PATH message over the
      backup route for LSP setup.  However, this does not mean that no
      process is needed for link protection.  Later on, the PLR will
      allocate an inner label for each newly created primary LSP and
      send it to Pn(s) and MP via RESV messages.  Details for label
      allocation and packet encapsulation are discussed in section
      4.1.2.

   o  If there is no backup LSP available, MP initiates the backup LSP
      setup: MP calculates a backup route by using CSPF taking PLR as
      the endpoint of the backup LSP and sends a PATH message towards
      PLR hop-by-hop over the backup route.  In the example of Figure 1,
      PATH messages will be sent from MP to Pn (R3) and relayed to PLR
      (R1).  PLR will then send a RESV message to MP, so as to complete
      the backup LSP setup.  Section 4.1.2 specifies the details about
      the label allocation and binding.

4.1.2.  Label Allocation for Link Protection

   As a backup LSP protects one or more primary LSPs, the facility
   protection scheme uses two labels for packet forwarding.  The outer
   label is used for regular packet forwarding hop-by-hop over the
   backup LSP, while the inner label is used to represent a primary LSP
   and used by MP to merge traffic forwarded over the backup LSP to its
   corresponding primary LSP.  Multiple primary LSPs will share the
   common outer label while the inner label is unique for each protected
   LSP.  Figure 7 below shows how the two labels are assigned and used
   for the facility backup.  There are two primary LSPs to be protected
   by a common backup LSP in this example.

      Figure 7: Label Allocation for Link Protection in Facility Mode

   Assume that primary LSP1 is created first, MP assigns a downstream
   label Lp12 for LSP1 being protected and sends the label to PLR via a
   PATH message over route {MP-PLR}.  Because the primary LSP1 is the
   first LSP created over this route, MP also assigns a downstream label
   Lb2 for the backup LSP and sends it to Pn via a PATH message over the
   backup route {MP-Pn-PLR}.  Pn allocates a downstream label Lb3 and
   sends it to PLR via a PATH message.

   Once PATH messages are received from MP and Pn respectively, PLR will
   allocate an inner label to represent the primary LSP1 for the backup
   LSP.  The method to allocate the inner label is implementation-
   specific.  In this example, label Lp12 is used as the inner label to

   represent primary LSP1 over the backup LSP.  LSR at merge point uses
   the inner label to locate the corresponding primary LSP.  The inner
   label is propagated from PLR to MP by a RESV message.  Note that PLR
   and MP are the only LSRs that actually see, use or process the inner
   label, while other transit node Pns do not process the inner label.

   The process for the second or additional primary LSPs protected by
   the same backup LSP is different from that for the first one.  MP
   does not allocate any new downstream label for the backup LSP since
   the backup LSP for the first primary LSP is shared between all the
   primary LSPs protected by the same backup LSP.  But the PLR is
   required to allocate an inner label for each newly created primary
   LSP and sends it to MP hop-by-hop via a RESV message.

   We use Figure 7 as an example to show the packet forwarding FIB entry
   by using the following format:

   FRR:(inner label),(incoming outer label)->(outgoing outer label),NHOP

   When MP allocates the downstream label Lp12 for the primary LSP1, an
   entry 'Lp12->Lp-pe1, PE1' is added into MP's FIB.  Another FRR entry
   'FRR: Lg12, Lb2->Lp-pe1, PE1' is added when MP receives a RESV
   message that carries an inner label Lg12 and binding information with
   LSP1.  So the MP will have two forwarding entries for each protected
   LSP.  In this example MP will maintain four entries in its FIB for
   the two protected paths LSP1 and LSP2:

      Lp12->Lp-pe1, PE1

      Lp22->Lp-pe2, PE2

      FRR: Lp12, Lb2 -> Lp-pe1, PE1

      FRR: Lp22, Lb2 -> Lp-pe2, PE2

   PLR creates a forwarding entry for a primary LSP whenever it receives
   a PATH message for the setup of a new primary LSP.  For each primary
   path LSP1, once PLR receives the PATH message from the backup route,
   PLR allocates an inner label for the primary LSP and creates an FRR
   entry in its FIB.  The PLR FIB will have these entries for the two
   protected LSP LSP1 and LSP2:

      Lp11 ->Lp12, MP

      Lp21->Lp22, MP

      FRR: Lp12, Lp11 -> Lb3, MP

      FRR: Lp22, Lp21 -> Lb3, MP

   Note that the transit routers Pn use the outer label for packet
   forwarding and keep the inner label untouched.

4.1.3.  Link Failure Repair in Facility Mode

   Before a link failure is detected, PLR encapsulates user packets with
   a single label Lp1 and forwards the packet to MP.  MP also uses a
   single label encapsulation and forwards the packet to PE (as per
   Figure 7).

   After a link failure is detected, the PLR (for example, R1 in Figure
   7) will encapsulate traffic with two labels: the outer label Lb2 is
   used for packet forwarding over the backup path, while the inner
   label Lp2 is used to map traffic to the corresponding primary LSP.
   MP will pop out outer label Lb2 if needed, swap inner label Lp12 with
   Lp-pe1, and then forward packets to PE1, as per the example of Figure
   7.

4.1.4.  Re-Convergence after Local Repair

   After a link failure occurs, the network will re-converge.  PLR will
   be notified as soon as a new best path for the primary LSP will be
   found and activated.  Then PLR will tear down the backup LSP, release
   backup labels and clean up entries in its FIB.

4.2.  Node Protection in Facility Backup Mode

4.2.1.  Backup LSP setup in Facility Mode

   Two methods for node protection in the facility protections scheme
   have been illustrated in Figures 3 and 4.  The method shown in Figure
   3 uses a P2MP or MP2MP backup LSP to protect a branch node N; the
   method shown in Figure 4 uses multiple LSPs to protect the node N.
   The first method is likely to reduce traffic replication on the
   backup LSP; the second method suffers from traffic overhead because
   multiple backup sub-LSPs are used.  Which method to use is design
   option.  In this document, we will use the method shown in Figure 3
   to describe the node protection mechanism in the facility protection
   scheme.

   Specific procedures are needed for the P2MP or MP2MP tree setup and
   label allocation.  Assume that LSR PE1 joins a primary P2MP tree
   structure in the example of Figure 3.  PE1 sends a RSVP PATH message
   to MP1 for LSP setup, this PATH message will be relayed to PLR
   through node N being protected.  MP1 calculates the backup route with
   a constraint to avoid node N; it initiates the backup LSP setup by

   sending a PATH message over the backup path {MP1-Pn2-Pn1-PLR}.  RSVP
   RESV messages will then be sent in return by PLR to MP1 through the
   primary {PLR-N-MP1} and the backup {PLR-Pn1-Pn2-MP1} routes
   respectively.

   Later on, another LSR PE2 joins the P2MP tree by sending a PATH
   message to MP2.  MP2 will relay the PATH message to node N being
   protected.  Then N becomes a branch node and it is therefore not
   necessary to send PATH messages to the PLR anymore.  MP2 performs the
   same procedure as MP1 did for the first branch {PE1-MP1-N}, a backup
   route {MP2-Pn2-Pn1-PLR} will be computed by CSPF, and the node Pn2
   now becomes a branch node that belongs to the backup P2MP tree.  The
   PATH message that used to be sent by Pn2 towards the PLR is not
   necessary anymore.  RSVP RESV messages will be sent back by the PLR
   to MP2 through the primary route {PLR-N-MP2} and the backup route
   {PLR-Pn1-Pn2-MP2} respectively.

   Whenever additional primary LSP(s) are set up as far as the same node
   N and PLR are connected, all these primary LSPs can be protected by
   the single backup LSP.  The procedure to setup the primary LSP is the
   same as what is used for the first primary LSP setup, the key
   technique is to allocate a unique identifier to a primary LSP and
   bind it with the backup LSP, as per the mechanism discribed in
   section 4.2.2.

4.2.2.  Label Allocation for Node Protection

   In order to achieve 1:n protection in Facility mode, a unique
   identifier must be assigned to represent each primary LSP being
   protected.  This identifier should be advertized to all the LSRs in a
   FRR domain and used for traffic switchover in case of node N failure.
   There are many ways to assign and use the identifier, and this
   document gives a sample mechanism based upon ULA (Upstream Label
   Allocation) to assign a MPLS label and use it as the identifier of a
   primary LSP.  Figure 8 provides an example of label allocation and
   FIB entry creation for the node protection in Facility mode.

   Figure 8: Label Allocation for P2MP Node Protection in Facility Mode

   In the FRR domain of Figure 8, an identical label Lpu is assigned to
   these sub-LSPs over the primary LSP: {PLR-N}, {N-MP1} and {N-MP2}.
   Lpu can be allocated by the branch node N for the primary LSP and
   used as the identifier of the primary LSP.  If there are multiple
   primary LSPs that cross the same node N and need to be protected by
   the single backup LSP, there will be multiple Lpu labels assigned for
   each of the primary LSPs accordingly.  In order to guarantee the
   uniqueness of Lpu in node N and MPs, the LSRs are required to have
   ULA capability in FRR domain.  In addition, an algorithm for ULA
   assignment and negotiation among the LSRs needs to be further
   specified by a yet-to-be-published internet draft.

   During normal operation, PLR encapsulates packets with the label Lpu
   and forwards them to node N over the primary LSP.  The node N as a
   branch node will replicate traffic to MP1 and MP2 using label Lpu in
   the example of Figure 8.  When a node failure is detected, PLR will
   redirect traffic to the backup LSP, and the two labels will be used
   for packet encapsulation over the backup LSP.  The inner label is Lpu
   and uniquely identifies a primary LSP; the outer label is allocated
   by MP and Pn(s) using DLA (Downstream Label Allocation), which is
   used for packet forwarding over the backup LSP by means of RSVP-TE

   mechanism.

   Detailed label allocation on each LSR is described below.

   1.  Label Allocation and FRR Entry on MP1 and MP2:

   For the first primary LSP setup, MP1 assigns a downstream label Lpdla
   for the primary LSP and sends it to the protected node N via a PATH
   message.  Node N discards Lpdla and uses ULA to assign a new label
   Lpu that will be used as a downstream label for N to send packets to
   MP1.

   Node N sends the label Lpu to MP1 via a RESV message; MP1 replaces
   its downstream assigned label Lpdla with Lpu. If Lpu has been used by
   another LSP on the LSR, MP1 will request node N to assign another Lpu
   by a RSVP notify message.  In case of conflict, an ULA negotiation
   procedure has to be executed (this procedure is TBD).

   MP1 also assigns a downstream label Lbdla for the backup LSP and
   sends it to Pn2 via a PATH message over the backup route {MP1-Pn2-
   Pn1-PLR in Figure 8}.  Pn2 is a branch node and will therefore
   execute the same procedure as the branch node N on the primary LSP.
   Pn2 discards label Lbdla received from the PATH message, assigns a
   new label Lbu and sends it to MP1 via a RESV message.

   Once a RESV message is originated by PLR and sent through the backup
   route, MP1 will get an inner label Lpu that represents the primary
   LSP in this example.  MP1 adds a FRR entry with both inner and outer
   label in its FIB.  MP1 FIB will have two forwarding entries for the
   LSP being protected in Facility mode:

      Lpu->Lp-pe1, PE1

      FRR: Lpu, Lbu->Lp-pe2, PE2

   With the same process, MP2 will have two forwarding entries for the
   LSP being protected:

      Lpu->Lp-pe2, PE2

      FRR: Lpu, Lbu->Lp-pe2, PE2

   2.  Label Allocation and FRR Entry on Pn2 and Pn1:

   As mentioned in the last paragraph, when Pn2 (transit branch node)
   receives PATH message from MP1 and MP2 respectively, it will allocate
   label Lbu and sends it to each MP.  Pn2 will have two forwarding
   entries for the LSP being protected:

      FRR: Lpu, Lb5->Lbu, MP1

      FRR: Lpu, Lb5->Lbu, MP2

   Pn1 is a transit node and has only one FRR entry for the LSP being
   protected:

      FRR: Lpu, Lb4->Lb5, Pn2

   3.  Label Allocation and FRR Entry on PLR:

   PLR receives a PATH message from node N that carries a downstream
   label Lpu and a PATH message from Pn1 that carries a downstream label
   Lb5.  PLR uses Lpu as an inner label for the primary LSP and sends it
   towards MPs through Pn1 by means of RESV message.  PLR will maintain
   two entries in its FIB for a given protected LSP:

      Lp1->Lpu, N

      FRR: Lpu, Lp1->Lb1, Pn1

   For every add-in primary LSP being protected by the same backup LSP,
   PLR will assign an inner label and send it to LSRs across the backup
   LSP so that each LSR can add the corresponding FRR entry in its FIB
   and use this entry to forward traffic over the backup LSP.

4.2.3.  Node Failure Repair and Packet Encapsulation

   Once protected node N fails and the failure is detected by PLR, it
   will initiate a switchover by redirecting traffic to the backup LSP.
   Packet encapsulation in each LSR over the backup LSP will be done
   based on the FRR entries of its FIB.  For example (Figure 8), a
   packet that arrives at PLR and which is supposed to be forwarded to
   node N by using entry 'Lp1->Lpu, N', will be redirected to Pn1 based
   on entry 'FRR: Lpu,Lp1->Lb4, Pn1'.  PLR encapsulates the packet with
   Lpu as inner label, Lb4 as outer label and forwards it to Pn1.  Pn1
   will swap outer label for packet forwarding and keep inner label
   unchanged.

   Once the packet reaches MP1, MP1 will pop out the outer label, swap
   the inner label with outgoing label Lp-pe1 and forward the packet to
   NHOP PE1 with a single label Lp-pe1, the packet de-capsulation/
   encapsulation is based on the 'FRR: Lpu, Lbu->Lp-pe1, PE1' entry.
   Once traffic reaches MP1, it is then merged with the primary path.
   The same procedure is applicable to receiver LSR MP2.

4.2.4.  Re-convergence after Local Repair

   Routers that do not belong to the FRR domain are not impacted by the
   link failure and local repair procedures.  However, the network will
   eventually re-converge and a new best path to reach the root of the
   RD P2MP tree structure will be computed by PE1 and PE2 (Figure 8).
   PLR will be notified as soon as the new primary path is determined.
   PLR will send notification message to Pn and MP sp that they tear
   down the detour LSP and withdraw backup labels.  There is no
   difference between facility and detour methods in terms of re-
   convergence process.
