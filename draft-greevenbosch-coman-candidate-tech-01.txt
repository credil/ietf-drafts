2.  Introduction

   In [I-D.ersue-constrained-mgmt], several use cases and associated
   requirements are defined for the management of constrained devices,
   in a possibly constrained network.

   This document identifies possible technologies associated with the
   use cases and requirements.

   In addition, this document includes several considerations associated
   with the requirements, that are relevant for choosing proper
   technologies.

   The goal of this document is to identify what has been done, and what
   still needs to be done.  Especially, it aims at establishing a
   clearer view of the scope and work in COMAN.

3.  Identified candidate technologies for the requirements

3.1.  OMA-LwM2M

   OMA Lightweight M2M [OMA-LwM2M-TS] aims at providing an underlying
   layer agnostic protocol to allow M2M service enablement and
   management between the LwM2M Server and the LwM2M Client, which is
   placed in the resource constrained devices.  The first version of
   enabler is currently being specified.  The enabler provides a light
   and compact protocol and a flat data structure, and can satisfy
   various management requirements for constrained devices.

   OMA-LwM2M has overlap with the following COMAN requirements:

   o  4.2.002 Compact encoding of management data

   o  4.4.001 Device status monitoring

   o  4.4.002 Energy status monitoring

   o  4.4.010 Logging

   o  4.6.001 Security and access control

   o  4.6.002 Authentication of managed devices

   o  4.6.003 Access control on managed constrained devices

   o  4.6.004 Access control on management systems

   o  4.6.005 Support suitable security bootstrapping mechanisms

   o  4.8.001 Software distribution (firmware update)

   Because of the overlap and early stage of OMA-LwM2M, good
   coordination between COMAN and OMA-LwM2M is advisable.

3.2.  OMA Device Management

   OMA Device Management [OMA-DM] provides various functions for mobile
   device management.  OMA-DM specifies and depends heavily on the
   SyncML language, which uses XML.  The typical underlying transport
   protocol is HTTP.  This makes OMA-DM in unaltered form infeasible for
   constrained devices.  Especially, it violates the following
   requirements:

   o  4.1.001 Support multiple device classes within a single network




Greevenbosch & Li        Expires August 29, 2013                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft       COMAN - Candidate Technologies        February 2013


   o  4.2.002 Compact encoding of management data

   Nevertheless, there is much overlap between OMA-DM functionality and
   COMAN requirements.  As such, OMA-DM MAY be used as inspiration for
   the COMAN solution.

   OMA-DM defines a general data model for management purpose, which is
   called a Management Object (MO).  MOs are stored on the device and
   can be manipulated by management actions carried over the OMA-DM
   protocol.  For each management purpose, a specific MO has been
   defined.  MOs relevant to the COMAN requirements include "FUMO" for
   firmware update requirements, "DiagMon MO" for diagnostic and
   monitoring requirements and the "Scheduling MO" for scheduling
   requirements.  The various MOs are discussed in Section 3.2.1 and its
   subsections.

   Apart from requirements covered by MOs, the following COMAN
   requirements intersect with the general OMA-DM functionality:

   o  4.1.008 Network-wide configuration - Use broadcast capability from
      OMA-DM 1.3 - Sessionless specification.

3.2.1.  OMA-DM Management Objects

3.2.1.1.  OMA DiagMon MO

   OMA DiagMon MO builds on and leverages the OMA DM v1.x protocol.  It
   provides standard DM Management Objects and associated client-side
   and server-side behaviour necessary to conduct diagnostics and
   monitoring activities on mobile devices.

   Requirements related to OMA DiagMon MO:

   o  4.4.003 Monitoring of current and estimated device availability:
      can be achieved by DiagMon functions MO.

   o  4.4.004 Network status monitoring: can be achieved by DiagMon
      functions MO.

   o  4.4.009 Notifications: can be achieved by reporting functions in
      DiagMon MO.

   o  4.4.011 Performance monitoring: can be achieved by DiagMon
      functions MO.

   o  4.4.012 Fault detection monitoring: can be achieved by Trap MO.

Internet-Draft       COMAN - Candidate Technologies        February 2013


   o  4.4.013 Passive monitoring: can be achieved by Trap MO.

   o  4.4.014 Reactive monitoring: can be achieved by Trap MO.

   o  4.5.001 Self-management: device events can be captured by Trap MO,
      to achieve self-management.

   o  4.5.002 Periodic self-management: device events can be captured by
      Trap MO periodically, to achieve self-management.

3.2.1.2.  OMA Scheduling MO

   The OMA-DM Scheduling MO enabler [OMA-Scheduling-MO] specifies the
   scheduling framework as well as its Management Objects that can be
   layered on top of OMA-DM v1.x, to seamlessly add the common
   scheduling capability to the OMA-DM based management infrastructure.
   With this capability, the OMA-DM system is able to schedule
   management operations on the device, and have them executed offline
   when the schedule - time-based or event-based - matches.

   Requirements related to OMA Scheduling MO:

   o  4.5.002 Periodic self-management: time-based scheduled task can
      achieve periodic self-management.

3.2.1.3.  OMA-FUMO

   OMA-FUMO provides information on management objects associated with
   firmware updates in OMA-DM based mobile devices and the behaviour
   associated with the processing of the management objects.

   Requirements related to OMA-FUMO:

   o  4.8.001 Software distribution: firmware update can be achieved by
      FUMO.

3.2.2.  ACL mechanism in OMA-DM

   OMA-DM [OMA-DM] defines the Access Control List (ACL) mechanism to
   control the access to the Management Objects.  ACL is a property
   associated with the Management Object nodes, and is used to grant
   access permissions to the server identifiers.

   Related requirements:

   o  4.6.003 Access control on managed constrained devices

   o  4.6.004 Access control on management systems

   o  4.6.005 Support suitable security bootstrapping mechanisms

3.3.  CoAP

   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [I-D.ietf-core-coap] is
   defined by the IETF.  It provides an application layer protocol
   especially designed for constrained devices.  It is binary and easy
   to parse.

   CoAP is especially suitable on top of IPv6 and UDP.  However, other
   lower level protocols are possible too.

   In addition, several drafts have been specified to target specific
   issues.

3.3.1.  CoAP main specification

   The following requirements are met by the CoAP main specification:

   o  4.1.001 Support multiple device classes within a single network -
      the low complexity of CoAP allows usage in all device classes.

   o  4.1.004 Minimise state maintained on constrained devices - CoAP
      has been designed to keep servers stateless.

   o  4.1.007 Support for lossy and unreliable links - through the CoAP
      CON retransmission mechanism.

   o  4.2.004 Mapping of management protocol interactions - CoAP
      provides HTTP/Coap Mapping.

   o  4.2.007 Protocol extensibility - mainly provided by options
      mechanism.

   o  4.3.004 Asynchronous transaction support - CoAP supports separate
      response and piggy-backed response.

   o  4.4.012 Fault detection monitoring (partly) - CoAP pinging allows
      verification if a device is online.

3.3.2.  CoAP capability discovery specifications

   Various CoAP drafts cover different aspects of capability discovery.

   o  RFC 6690 [RFC6690] defines a link format, which provides
      information on resources a server is offering.

   o  The draft [I-D.greevenbosch-core-profile-description] allows
      signalling a CoAP server profile.

   o  The draft [I-D.shelby-core-resource-directory] allows acquiring
      information about resources from another server, called the
      "Resource Directory".

   o  The draft [I-D.lynn-core-discovery-mapping] provides a mapping
      between the resource directory and a DNS lookup.  This allows
      usage of DNS lookup for the discovery of CoAP servers.

   o  The informational draft [I-D.vanderstok-core-dna] discusses
      mapping between IP address and a Fully Qualified Domain Name
      (FQDN), proposing DNS for lookup of the IP address.  In addition,
      it discusses possible naming conventions, group communication and
      resource discovery.  Towards the latter, registration of new
      devices to the resource directory is discussed.

   Related COMAN requirement:

   o  4.3.003 Capability discovery

3.3.3.  CoAP group communication

   The informational CoAP group communication draft
   [I-D.ietf-core-groupcomm] discusses various aspects of group
   communication through IP multicast [RFC4604] in CoAP.

   Another informational draft discussing group communication is
   [I-D.vanderstok-core-dna].  This draft gives detailed examples, and
   discusses multicast, naming and DNS mapping of groups.

   Related COMAN requirement:

   o  4.8.002 Group-based provisioning

3.3.4.  CoAP energy saving technology

   The draft [I-D.rahman-core-sleepy] provides a mechanisms for sleepy
   devices.  These mechanisms include informing an intermediate resource
   directory (defined in [I-D.shelby-core-resource-directory]) of its
   waking up or intent to fall asleep.  Through these two drafts,
   clients can use the observe mechanism [I-D.ietf-core-observe] to be
   informed of whether a device is sleeping or active.

   o  4.1.005 Support devices that are not always online

   o  4.7.005 Support of energy-optimized communication protocols

3.3.5.  Congestion avoidance in CoAP

   The considerations in this section relate to:

   o  4.9.001 Congestion avoidance

   o  4.9.003 Traffic delay schemes

   The draft [I-D.bormann-core-cocoa] provides general background
   information about CoAP congestion control, and its challanges.

   The draft [I-D.li-core-conditional-observe] defines a mechanism to
   signal minimum time between CoAP observations.

   The draft [I-D.greevenbosch-core-minimum-request-interval] defines a
   mechanism to restrict the speed in which a CoAP client sends requests
   to the CoAP server.

   Other ways to delay the traffic in CoAP is by sending delayed ACKs.
   However, this has limitations as too much delay will lead to
   retransmits from the client side.  In addition, this method requires
   the server to maintain bookkeeping of the delayed ACKs.

3.4.  Cryptography considerations

   4.6.001 Security and access control

   4.6.002 Authentication of managed devices

   o  The raw public key as defined in [I-D.ietf-tls-oob-pubkey] can be
      used for establishing security and authentication.

   o  OCSP-lite as defined in [I-D.greevenbosch-tls-ocsp-lite] can be
      used for revocation checking of the raw public key.

   4.6.005 Support suitable security bootstrapping mechanisms

   o  The draft [I-D.jennings-core-transitive-trust-enrollment]
      describes a system in which a Device is introduced to a Controller
      by a Introducer.  In this draft, it is suggested that the Device
      symmetric key is coded as a QR code on the box, which can be read
      by the Controller, which may be a mobile phone with internet
      access.

   BACnet exists under the auspices of the American Society of Heating,
   Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE).  BACnet is an
   American national standard, a European standard, a national standard
   in more than 30 countries, and an ISO global standard.  The protocol

Internet-Draft       COMAN - Candidate Technologies        February 2013


   is supported and maintained by ASHRAE Standing Standard Project
   Committee (SSPC) 135.  BACnet is the most deployed communications
   standard for building control in the USA.  It consists of a number of
   working groups.  Their results are published in one BACnet
   specification document: International ISO standard 16484-5
   [ISO16484-5].  It defines a network architecture on top of several
   PHYs (ARCnet, MS/TP, Ethernet, P2P, LONTalk) and IP.  It specifies a
   number of object types from which a control system can be composed.
   Central is the device objects (unique per device) that maintains all
   organization information for a given devices.  Object types are
   defined for scheduling, grouping, alarm handling, object and device
   management, and service discovery.  The BACnet specification includes
   an extensive Alarm and Event service, and object access service for
   system configuration purposes, and remote device management services.

   The following requirements are met by the BACnet specification:

   o  4.1.001 Support multiple device classes within a single network -
      the BACnet standard has an open source implementation that fits on
      the smallest devices and can also be deployed on larger devices

   o  4.1.002 Management scalability - the BACnet standard defines a
      hierarchical management structure where data are collected from
      all devices with support from information in the device object.  A
      working group is dedicated to defining the architecture for
      storing historical data of the control system in a central
      repository using the ATOM standard.

   o  4.1.003 Hierarchical management - hierarchical management is
      supported by the device and object structure, the independent
      structure in alarm management, and the group object which supports
      the grouping of commands.

   o  4.1.004 Minimize state maintained on constrained devices - state
      is minimized by a selection of objects in the control devices

   o  4.1.008 Distributed Management - BACnet does provide the
      possibility to export management to multiple managers, however, no
      atomic write and read is specified, although there is a
      transaction concept at network level.

   o  4.2.001 Modular implementation of management protocols - BACnet
      encourages and prescribes a modular implementation by segmenting
      the management functions and distributing them over different
      objects.

   o  4.2.002 Compact encoding of management data - BACnet transports
      binary data encoded according to ASN.1, reduces storage space as

      much as feasible given the specified functionality.

   o  4.2.003 Compression of management data or complete messages -
      BACnet encodes messages according to ASN.1 standard.

   o  4.2.005 Consistency of data models with the underlying information
      model - BACnet has an ATOM based information model and prescribes
      the mapping between the information model and the data model
      present in the nodes.

   o  4.2.007 Protocol extensibility - the BACnet model encourages
      extensibility, as proven by the constant backwards compatible
      standards updates.  The standards extension process is slow and
      sets the extension pace.

   o  4.3.001 Self-configuration capability - BACnet supports discovery
      of devices, their objects and properties.

   o  4.3.002 Capability Discovery - See 4.3.001.

   o  4.3.004 Network reconfiguration - BACnet knows the concept of
      BACnet routers.  Routers declare themselves to network segments,
      and can be allocated started, stopped.  No automatic procedures
      are described for full auto-configuration.

   o  4.4.001 Device status monitoring - BACnet provides extensive tools
      for network and device status monitoring.

   o  4.4.004 Network status monitoring - see 4.4.001.

   o  4.4.006 Performance Monitoring - BACnet defines a set of
      application layer objects.  Dependent on their function,
      performance measures are monitored and events or alarms are
      generated to be monitored by an alarm handling service.

   o  4.4.007 Fault detection monitoring - BACnet includes fault
      detection monitoring at network level.

   o  4.4.009 Recovery - BACnet provides functions for network recovery
      and object, device recovery without specifying how these functions
      must be used in case of given errors.

   o  4.4.010 Network topology discovery - this is a rather basic
      capability of a BACnet network.

   o  4.4.011 Notifications - the BACnet alarm and event services are
      dedicated to this topic.

   o  4.6.001 Authentication of management system and devices - BACnet
      security service provides authentication of peers, operators and
      data source.

   o  4.10.003 Best-effort multicast - BACnet goes to great pains to
      provide a broadcast facility which is essential for its
      configuration purposes.

6.  Conclusion and recommendations

   In this document, we have identified possible technologies that can
   be used to realise the COMAN use cases.  COMAN should consider
   referencing these technologies when appropriate.  In addition, this
   document points at technologies that are missing, and hence need
   standardisation.  We recommend to do this standardisation in COMAN,
   and in addition write a document in COMAN that describes the overall
   system.
