              IPsec sequence number integrity check value
                     draft-song-ipsecme-seq-icv-01

Abstract

   This document specifies an IPsec AH and ESP sequence number
   validation scheme, which is complementary to the existing ICV
   mechanism and anti-replay mechanism of AH and ESP in defense against
   DOS attack.  It is an optional feature negotiable through IKE, for
   this feature to be negotiated, both sender and receiver must
   implement it.  If any party doesn't support it, then this feature
   should be excluded from negotiation.  The rationale for such a scheme
   is discussed first; then requirements and guidelines for design of
   the scheme are laid out.  There can be various ways to implement the
   scheme, some reference designs are discussed to set the base for
   effort of identifying best practice and eventually establishing a
   standard on the subject.

1.  Introduction

   As defense against replay attack, IPsec, both AH and ESP, uses anti-
   replay window to keep track of the sequence numbers of received
   packets, and reject packets with sequence number that is either too
   old (below anti-replay window) or duplicate (within anti-replay
   window, but marked as received).  Anti-replay window is not effective
   against DOS attack by packets with sequence number that are above
   anti-replay window, in which case the sequence number is neither
   considered too old, nor duplicate.  Attack packets with sequence
   number above anti-replay window would penetrate anti-replay check and
   only be rejected after failing ICV check.  The issue is that ICV
   check, which involves hashing operation, is rather expensive in terms
   of resource and time consumption.  In case of ESP, when hardware
   crypto acceleration engine is used, ICV check and decryption often
   need to be performed together to optimize bandwidth efficiency, which
   makes the operation even more expensive.  Large number of such
   packets would cause recevier's service degradation or interruption
   because significant amount of receiver's resource and time would be
   consumed by performing expensive ICV check on these packets.

   An inexpensive mechanism to check sequence number would allow
   rejecting such packets without causing service degradation or
   interruption.  This check can be performed either before or after
   anti-replay check depending on policy and situation, but must be
   performed before ICV check.  Such check doesn't have to be 100%
   accurate as long as it doesn't yield false positive result, i.e.
   mistaking correct sequence number as incorrect sequence number, since
   the packet with false negative result, i.e. incorrect sequence number
   passing the check, will be caught by ICV check eventually.  But it
   must be significantly more resource and time efficient than ICV check
   to be beneficial.

   This check will increase packet length slightly, and incur slight
   computation overhead per packet, but greatly improve IPsec's
   capability to withstand DOS attack.  This check would not be
   effective if attacker can prevent original packets from reaching
   destination, since in such case the attacker doesn't need to change
   sequence number, instead he or she can change payload, then the
   packet would pass both anti-replay check and this proposed sequence
   number check.  But in order to shoot down original packets, attacker
   must compromise intermediate router.  The proposed sequence number
   check is not designed to defend against attacks that involves
   compromised intermediate router, instead it is designed against
   attacks where attacker does not control intermediate router, but is
   able to obtain copy of original packets and launch attack by changing
   sequence number of the original packets to values that are greater so
   that anti-replay check would pass and ICV check is required.  The
   latter is simpler attack and easier to carry out therefore is a more
   serious threat.

   This check is not designed for systems that are capable of line rate
   ICV check; instead it is designed for systems that are not capable of
   line rate ICV check.  This check makes it possible for systems that
   are not capable of line rate ICV check to continue with normal
   function when under attacks, as long as the original packets are
   still being delivered, or in another words, as long as the network in
   between is not compromised.  Systems that are capable of line rate
   ICV check should decline SEQ-ICV in negotiation.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  SEQ-ICV

   SEQ-ICV is a 4 byte value generated by sender for each IPsec packet
   based on 4 byte packet sequence number, 12 byte ICV value, and 16
   byte secret key known and only known to sender and receiver.  The
   value is appended to immediately follow ICV and transmitted together
   with the packet to receiver, which generates its own value locally
   the same way as sender, then compares with the transmitted value.  If
   the value is the same, then the sequence number is considered to be
   good, otherwise the sequence number is considered to be bad.

   Packet length field can only be adjusted after generating ICV, since
   ICV must be based on the packet length without SEQ-ICV

   3.  Compare locally generated SEQ-ICV with received SEQ-ICV

   4.  Reject packet if not same, otherwise adjust packet length field
       of IP header proceed to AH processing

   Packet length field must be adjusted before AH processing

   2.  generate SEQ-ICV

   3.  Compare locally generated SEQ-ICV with received SEQ-ICV

   4.  Reject packet if not same, otherwise proceed to ESP processing

   In calculating ESP payload length, SEQ-ICV must be excluded.

   Enable SEQ-ICV dynamically

   If too many packets passed anti-replay but failed ICV check, then
   notify sender to enable SEQ-ICV, and receiver begins SEQ-ICV check
   but would not reject packets that failed SEQ-ICV check, once receiver
   no longer observes packets passing ICV check but failing SEQ-ICV
   check, then receiver considers SEQ-ICV has been enabled, and begins
   to reject packet that failed SEQ-ICV check.

   Disable SEQ-ICV dynamically

   If no packets passed anti-replay but failed SEQ-ICV, then notify
   sender to disable SEQ-ICV, and receiver stops rejecting packets that
   failed SEQ-ICV check, once receiver no longer observes packets
   passing both SEQ-ICV and ICV check, but only packets passing ICV
   check, then receiver considers SEQ-ICV has been disabled, and stops
   checking SEQ-ICV

   Following is summary of conditions that could occur throughout the
   whole process of dynamically enabling and disabling SEQ-ICV with
   assumption that original packets are delivered,

5.  IKE negotiation

   SEQ-ICV will be a type of transform used in AH/ESP.

   Following is list of transform IDs that will be defined for transform
   type of SEQ-ICV


   Name                                              Number
   ----------------------------------------------------------
   No SEQ-ICV                                          0
   Static SEQ-ICV                                      1
   Dynamic SEQ-ICV                                     2



   Note that an initiator who supports SEQ-ICV will usually construct
   two proposal, one with SEQ-ICV transform, another without SEQ-ICV
   transform.  It allows implementation that doesn't support SEQ-ICV to
   choose proposal without SEQ-ICV.  In the proposal containing SEQ-ICV
   transform, an initiator will usually include at least two SEQ-ICV
   transforms, one with value "0", one with value "1" or "2".  A
   proposal containing a single SEQ-ICV transform with value "1" or "2"
   means that SEQ-ICV must be used.

   A Notify payload with Notify Message Type of SEQ-ICV_ENABLE in an
   Informational Exchange will be used to notify sender of SEQ-ICV
   enabling when receiver is under attack by packets with modified
   sequence number.
