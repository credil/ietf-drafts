Internet-Draft                  TURN URIs                 September 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the syntax and semantics of the Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for the Traversal Using Relays
   around NAT (TURN) protocol.

   The TURN protocol is a specification allowing hosts behind NAT to
   control the operation of a relay server.  The relay server allows
   hosts to exchange packets with its peers.  The peers themselves may
   also be behind NATs.  RFC 5766 [RFC5766] defines the specifics of the
   TURN protocol.

   The "turn/turns" URI scheme is used to designate a TURN server (also
   known as a relay) on Internet hosts accessible using the TURN
   protocol.  With the advent of standards such as [WEBRTC] , we
   anticipate a plethora of endpoints and web applications to be able to
   identify and communicate with such a TURN server to carry out the
   TURN protocol.  This also implies those endpoints and/or applications
   to be provisioned with appropriate configuration required to identify
   the TURN server.  Having an inconsistent syntax has its drawbacks and
   can result in non-interoperable solutions.  It can result in
   solutions that are ambiguous and have implementation limitations on
   the different aspects of the syntax and alike.  The "turn/turns" URI
   scheme helps alleviate most of these issues by providing a consistent
   way to describe, configure and exchange the information identifying a
   TURN server.  This would also prevent the shortcomings inherent with
   encoding similar information in non-uniform syntaxes such as the ones
   proposed in [WEBRTC] , for example.

   [RFC5928] defines a resolution mechanism to convert a secure flag, a
   host name or IP address, an eventually empty port, and an eventually
   empty transport to a list of IP address, port, and TURN transport
   tuples.

   To simplify the provisioning of TURN clients, this document defines a
   TURN and a TURNS URI scheme that can carry the four components needed
   for the resolution mechanism.

   A reference implementation [REF-IMPL] is available.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] .

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", and "NOT RECOMMENDED" are

   appropriate when valid exceptions to a general requirement are known
   to exist or appear to exist, and it is infeasible or impractical to
   enumerate all of them.  However, they should not be interpreted as
   permitting implementors to fail to implement the general requirement
   when such failure would result in interoperability failure.


3.  Syntax of a TURN or TURNS URI

3.1.  URI Scheme Syntax

   The "turn" URI takes the following form (the syntax below is non-
   normative):

      turn:<host>:<port>
      turns:<host>:<port>

   Note that the <port> part and the preceding ":" (colon) character, is
   OPTIONAL.

   A TURN/TURNS URI has the following formal ABNF syntax [RFC5234] :
   turnURI       = scheme ":" turn-host [ ":" turn-port ]
                   [ "?transport=" transport ]
   scheme        = "turn" / "turns"
   transport     = "udp" / "tcp" / transport-ext
   transport-ext = 1*unreserved
   turn-host     = IP-literal / IPv4address / reg-name
   turn-port     = *DIGIT
   IP-literal    = "[" ( IPv6address / IPvFuture  ) "]"
   IPvFuture     = "v" 1*HEXDIG "." 1*( unreserved / sub-delims / ":" )
   IPv6address   =                              6( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   /                       "::" 5( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [               h16 ] "::" 4( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [ *1( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::" 3( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [ *2( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::" 2( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [ *3( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"    h16 ":"   ls32
                   / [ *4( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"              ls32
                   / [ *5( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"              h16
                   / [ *6( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"
   h16           = 1*4HEXDIG
   ls32          = ( h16 ":" h16 ) / IPv4address
   IPv4address   = dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet
   dec-octet     = DIGIT                 ; 0-9
                   / %x31-39 DIGIT       ; 10-99
                   / "1" 2DIGIT          ; 100-199
                   / "2" %x30-34 DIGIT   ; 200-249
                   / "25" %x30-35        ; 250-255
   reg-name      = *( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims )

Internet-Draft                  TURN URIs                 September 2012


   <unreserved>, <sub-delims>, and <pct-encoded> are specified in
   [RFC3986] .  The core rules <DIGIT> and <HEXDIGIT> are used as
   described in Appendix B of RFC 5234 [RFC5234] .

   The <host>, <port> and <transport> components are passed without
   modification to the [RFC5928] algorithm. <secure> is set to false if
   <scheme> is equal to "turn" and set to true if <scheme> is equal to
   "turns" and passed to the [RFC5928] algorithm with the other
   components.

3.2.  URI Scheme Semantics

   The TURN protocol supports sending messages over UDP, TCP or TLS-
   over-TCP.  The "turns" URI scheme SHALL be used when TURN is run over
   TLS-over-TCP (or in the future DTLS-over-UDP) and the "turn" scheme
   SHALL be used otherwise.

   The required <host> part of the "turn" URI denotes the TURN server
   host.

   The <port> part, if present, denotes the port on which the TURN
   server is awaiting connection requests.  If it is absent, the default
   port SHALL be 3478 for both UDP and TCP.  The default port for TURN
   over TLS SHALL be 5349.


4.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for the resolution mechanism are discussed in
   [RFC5928] .

   The "turn" and "turns" URI schemes do not introduce any specific
   security issues beyond the security considerations discussed in
   [RFC3986] .


5.  IANA Considerations

   This section contains the registration information for the "turn" and
   "turns" URI Schemes (in accordance with [RFC4395] ).

B.1.  Design Notes

   o  One recurring comment was to stop using the suffix "s" on URI
      scheme, and to move the secure option to a parameter (e.g.
      ";proto=tls").  We decided against this idea because the STUN URI
      does not have a ";proto=" parameter and we would have lost the
      symmetry between the TURN and STUN URIs.  A more detailed account
      of the reasoning behind this is available at <http://
      blog.marc.petit-huguenin.org/2012/09/
      on-design-of-stun-and-turn-uri-formats.html>

Internet-Draft                  TURN URIs                 September 2012


   o  Following the advice of RFC 4395 section 2.2., and because the
      TURN URI does not describe a hierarchical structure, the TURN URIs
      are opaque URIs.
   o  <password> is not used in the URIs because it is deprecated.
      <username> is not used in the URIs because it is not used to guide
      the resolution mechanism.
   o  As discussed in Dublin, there is no generic parameters in the URI
      to prevent compatibity issues.

B.2.  Modifications between petithuguenin-behave-turn-uris-02 and
      petithuguenin-behave-turn-uris-01

   o  Added design note about choice for turn/turns syntax.
