	This document provides a set of requirements for Advanced
	Multipath in MPLS Networks.
      </t>
      <t>
	Advanced Multipath is a formalization of multipath techniques
	currently in use in IP and MPLS networks and a set of
	extensions to existing multipath techniques.
      </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	There is often a need to provide large aggregates of bandwidth
	that are best provided using parallel links between routers or
	carrying traffic over multiple MPLS LSP.  In core networks
	there is often no alternative since the aggregate capacities
	of core networks today far exceed the capacity of a single
	physical link or single packet processing element.
      </t>
      <t>
	The presence of parallel links, with each link potentially
	comprised of multiple layers has resulted in additional
	requirements.  Certain services may benefit from being
	restricted to a subset of the component links or a specific
	component link, where component link characteristics, such as
	latency, differ.  Certain services require that an LSP be
	treated as atomic and avoid reordering.  Other services will
	continue to require only that reordering not occur within a
	microflow as is current practice.
      </t>
      <t>
	The purpose of this document is to clearly enumerate a set of
	requirements related to the protocols and mechanisms that
	provide MPLS based Advanced Multipath.  The intent is to first
	provide a set of functional requirements that are as
	independent as possible of protocol specifications in
	<xref target="FR" />.  A set of general protocol requirements
	are defined in <xref target="GR" />.  A set of network
	management requirements are defined in <xref target="MR" />.
      </t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>
	  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
          "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
          and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
          described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Any statement which requires the solution to support some
	  new functionality through use of <xref target="RFC2119" />
	  keywords, SHOULD be interpreted as follows.  The
	  implementation either MUST or SHOULD support the new
	  functionality depending on the use of either MUST or SHOULD
	  in the requirements statement.  The implementation SHOULD in
	  most or all cases allow any new functionality to be
	  individually enabled or disabled through configuration.  A
	  service provider or other deployment MAY choose to enable or
	  disable any feature in their network, subject to
	  implementation limitations on sets of features which can be
	  disabled.

    <section anchor="def" title="Definitions">
      <t>
	<list hangIndent="4" style="hanging">
	  <t hangText="Multipath">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    The term multipath includes all techniques in which
	    <list style="numbers">
	      <t>
		Traffic can take more than one path from one node to a
		destination.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		Individual packets take one path only.  Packets are
		not subdivided and reassembled at the receiving end.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		Packets are not resequenced at the receiving end.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		The paths may be:
		<list style="letters">
		  <t>
		    parallel links between two nodes, or
		  </t>
		  <t>
		    may be specific paths across a network to a
		    destination node, or
		  </t>
		  <t>
		    may be links or paths to an intermediate node used
		    to reach a common destination.
		  </t>
		</list>
	      </t>
	    </list>
	    The paths need not have equal capacity.  The paths may or
	    may not have equal cost in a routing protocol.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Advanced Multipath">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    Advanced Multipath meets the requirements defined in this
	    document.  A key capability of advanced multipath is the
	    support of non-homogeneous component links.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Composite Link">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    The term Composite Link had been a registered trademark of
	    Avici Systems, but was abandoned in 2007.  The term
	    composite link is now defined by the ITU-T in
	    <xref target="ITU-T.G.800" />.  The ITU-T definition
	    includes multipath as defined here, plus inverse
	    multiplexing which is explicitly excluded from the
	    definition of multipath.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Inverse Multiplexing">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    Inverse multiplexing either transmits whole packets and
	    resequences the packets at the receiving end or subdivides
	    packets and reassembles the packets at the receiving end.
	    Inverse multiplexing requires that all packets be handled
	    by a common egress packet processing element and is
	    therefore not useful for very high bandwidth applications.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Component Link">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    The ITU-T definition of composite link in
	    <xref target="ITU-T.G.800" /> and the IETF definition of
	    link bundling in <xref target="RFC4201" /> both refer to
	    an individual link in the composite link or link bundle as
	    a component link.  The term component link is applicable
	    to all forms of multipath.  The IEEE uses the term member
	    rather than component link in Ethernet Link Aggregation
	    <xref target="IEEE-802.1AX" />.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Client LSP">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    A client LSP is an LSP which has been set up over a server
	    layer.  In the context of this discussion, a client LSP is
	    a LSP which has been set up over a multipath as opposed to
	    an LSP representing the multipath itself or any LSP
	    supporting a component links of that multipath.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Flow">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    A sequence of packets that should be transferred in order on
	    one component link of a multipath.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Flow identification">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    The label stack and other information that uniquely
	    identifies a flow.  Other information in flow
	    identification may include an IP header, pseudowire (PW)
	    control word, Ethernet MAC address, etc.  Note that a
	    client LSP may contain one or more Flows or a client LSP
	    may be equivalent to a Flow.  Flow identification is used
	    to locally select a component link, or a path through the
	    network toward the destination.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Load Balance">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    Load split, load balance, or load distribution refers to
	    subdividing traffic over a set of component links such
	    that load is fairly evenly distributed over the set of
	    component links and certain packet ordering requirements
	    are met.  Some existing techniques better achieve these
	    objectives than others.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Performance Objective">
	    <vspace blankLines="0" />
	    Numerical values for performance measures, principally
	    availability, latency, and delay variation.  Performance
	    objectives may be related to Service Level Agreements
	    (SLA) as defined in RFC2475 or may be strictly internal.
	    Performance objectives may span links, edge-to-edge, or
	    end-to-end.  Performance objectives may span one provider
	    or may span multiple providers.
	  </t>
	</list>
      </t>
      <t>
        A Component Link may be a point-to-point physical link (where
        a "physical link" includes one or more link layer plus a
        physical layer) or a logical link that preserves ordering in
        the steady state.  A component link may have transient out of
        order events, but such events must not exceed the network's
        Performance Objectives.  For example, a component link may be
        comprised of any supportable combination of link layers over a
        physical layer or over logical sub-layers, including those
        providing physical layer emulation.
      </t>
      <t>
	The ingress and egress of a multipath may be midpoint LSRs
	with respect to a given client LSP.  A midpoint LSR does not
	participate in the signaling of any clients of the client LSP.
	Therefore, in general, multipath endpoints cannot determine
	requirements of clients of a client LSP through participation
	in the signaling of the clients of the client LSP.
      </t>
      <t>
	The term Advanced Multipath is intended to be used within the
	context of this document and the related documents,
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-cl-use-cases" />
	and
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-cl-framework" />
	and any other related document.  Other advanced multipath
	techniques may in the future arise.  If the capabilities
	defined in this document become commonplace, they would no
	longer be considered "advanced".  Use of the term "advanced
	multipath" outside this document, if referring to the term as
	defined here, should indicate Advanced Multipath as defined by
	this document, citing the current document name.  If using
	another definition of "advanced multipath", documents may
	optionally clarify that they are not using the term "advanced
	multipath" as defined by this document if clarification is
	deemed helpful.

	       title="Availability, Stability and Transient Response">
	<t>
	  Limiting the period of unavailability in response to
	  failures or transient events is extremely important as well
	  as maintaining stability. The transient period between some
	  service disrupting event and the convergence of the routing
	  and/or signaling protocols MUST occur within a time frame
	  specified by Performance Objective values.
	</t>

	  <list counter="fr" hangIndent="4" style="format FR#%d">
	    <t>
	      An advanced multipath MAY be announced in conjunction with
	      detailed parameters about its component links, such as
	      bandwidth and latency. The advanced multipath SHALL behave
	      as a single IGP adjacency.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The solution SHALL provide a means to summarize some
	      routing advertisements regarding the characteristics of
	      an advanced multipath such that the updated protocol
	      mechanisms maintain convergence times within the
	      timeframe needed to meet or not significantly exceed
	      existing Performance Objective for convergence on the
	      same network or convergence on a network with a similar
	      topology.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The solution SHALL ensure that restoration operations
	      happen within the timeframe needed to meet existing
	      Performance Objective for restoration time on the same
	      network or restoration time on a network with a similar
	      topology.

	    <t>
	      The solution shall provide a mechanism to select a set

	      flows within the LSP are distributed across the set of
	      paths while meeting all of the other requirements stated
	      above.  The solution SHOULD work in a manner similar to
	      existing multipath techniques except as necessary to
	      accommodate advanced multipath requirements.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      If extensions to existing protocols are specified and/or
	      new protocols are defined, then the solution SHOULD
	      provide a means for a network operator to migrate an
	      existing deployment in a minimally disruptive manner.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Any load balancing solutions MUST NOT oscillate.  Some
	      change in path MAY occur.  The solution MUST ensure that
	      path stability and traffic reordering continue to meet
	      Performance Objective on the same network or on a
	      network with a similar topology.  Since oscillation may
	      cause reordering, there MUST be means to control the
	      frequency of changing the component link over which a
	      flow is placed.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Management and diagnostic protocols MUST be able to

	  Existing scaling techniques used in MPLS networks apply to
	  MPLS networks which support Advanced Multipaths.  Scalability

      <section anchor="layering"
	       title="Component Links Provided by Lower Layer
	       Networks">
	<t>
	  A component link may be supported by a lower layer network.
	  For example, the lower layer may be a circuit switched
	  network or another MPLS network (e.g., MPLS-TP)). The lower
	  layer network may change the latency (and/or other
	  performance parameters) seen by the client layer.
	  Currently, there is no protocol for the lower layer network
	  to inform the higher layer network of a change in a
	  performance parameter.  Communication of the latency
	  performance parameter is a very important requirement.
	  Communication of other performance parameters (e.g., delay
	  variation) is desirable.
          <list counter="fr" hangIndent="4" style="format FR#%d">
	    <t>
	      The solution SHALL specify a protocol means to allow a
	      lower layer server network to communicate latency to the
	      higher layer client network.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The precision of latency reporting SHOULD be
	      configurable.  A reasonable default SHOULD be provided.
	      Implementations SHOULD support precision of at least 10%
	      of the one way latencies for latency of 1 msec or more.
	    </t>
	  </list>
	</t>
	<t>
	  The intent is to measure the predominant latency in
	  uncongested service provider networks, where geographic
	  delay dominates and is on the order of milliseconds or more.
	  The argument for including queuing delay is that it reflects
	  the delay experienced by applications.  The argument against
	  including queuing delay is that it if used in routing
	  decisions it can result in routing instability.  This
	  tradeoff is discussed in detail in <xref
	  target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-cl-framework" />.

	       title="Component Links with Different Characteristics">
	<t>
	  As one means to provide high availability, network operators
	  deploy a topology in the MPLS network using lower layer
	  networks that have a certain degree of diversity at the
	  lower layer(s).  Many techniques have been developed to
	  balance the distribution of flows across component links
	  that connect the same pair of nodes.  When the path for a
	  flow can be chosen from a set of candidate nodes connected
	  via advanced multipaths, other techniques have been
	  developed.  Refer to the Appendices in <xref

	<t>
	  Some client LSP MAY require a path bound to a specific set
	  of component links.  This case is most likely to occur in
	  bidirectional client LSP where time synchronization
	  protocols such as PTP or NTP are carried, or in any other
	  case where symmetric delay is highly desirable.  There may
	  be other uses of this capability.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Other client LSP may only require that the LSP path serve
	  the same set of nodes in both directions.  This is necessary
	  if protocols are carried which make use of the reverse
	  direction of the LSP as a back channel in cases such OAM
	  protocols using TTL to monitor or diagnose the underlying
	  path.  There may be other uses of this capability.

	      The solution MUST support an optional means for client
	      LSP signaling to bind a client LSP to a particular
	      component link within an advanced multipath.  If this
	      option is not exercised, then a client LSP that is bound
	      to an advanced multipath may be bound to any component
	      link matching all other signaled requirements, and
	      different directions of a bidirectional client LSP can
	      be bound to different component links.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The solution MUST support a means to indicate that both

	  A client LSP which is bound to a specific component link
	  SHOULD NOT exceed the capacity of a single component link.

	<t>
	  For some large bidirectional client LSP it may not be
	  necessary (or possible due to the client LSP capacity) to
	  bind the LSP to a common set of component links but may be
	  necessary or desirable to constrain the path taken by the
	  LSP to the same set of nodes in both directions.  Without
	  and entirely new and highly dynamic protocol, it is not
	  feasible to constrain such an bidirectional client LSP to
	  take multiple paths and coordinate load balance on each side
	  to keep both directions of flows within such an LSP on
	  common paths.

	       title="Multipath Load Balancing Dynamics">
	<t>
	  Multipath load balancing attempts to keep traffic levels on
	  all component links below congestion levels if possible and
	  preferably well balanced.  Load balancing is minimally
	  disruptive (see discussion below this section's list of
	  requirements).  The sensitivity to these minimal disruptions
	  of traffic flows within specific client LSP needs to be
	  considered.
	</t>
	<t>
	  <list counter="fr" hangIndent="4" style="format FR#%d">
	    <t>
	      The solution SHALL provide a means that indicates
	      whether any of the flows within an client LSP MUST NOT
	      be split across multiple component links.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The solution SHALL provide a means local to a node that
	      automatically distributes flows across the component
	      links in the advanced multipath such that Performance
	      Objectives are met as described in prior requirements in
	      <xref target="multipath-diff" />.
	    </t>
            <t>
	      The solution SHALL measure traffic flows or groups of
	      traffic flows and dynamically select the component link
	      on which to place this traffic in order to balance the
	      load so that no component link in the advanced multipath
	      between a pair of nodes is overloaded.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      When a traffic flow is moved from one component link to
	      another in the same advanced multipath between a set of
	      nodes, it MUST be done so in a minimally disruptive
	      manner.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Load balancing MAY be used during sustained low traffic
	      periods to reduce the number of active component links
	      for the purpose of power reduction.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The solution SHALL provide a means to identify client
	      LSPs containing traffic flows whose rearrangement
	      frequency needs to be bounded by a specific value and
	      MUST provide a means to bound the rearrangement
	      frequency for traffic flows within these client LSP.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The solution SHALL provide a means to distribute traffic
	      flows from a single client LSP across multiple component
	      links to handle at least the case where the traffic
	      carried in an client LSP exceeds that of any component
	      link in the advanced multipath.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The solution SHOULD support the use case where an
	      advanced multipath itself is a component link for a
	      higher order advanced multipath.  For example, an
	      advanced multipath comprised of MPLS-TP bi-directional
	      tunnels viewed as logical links could then be used as a
	      component link in yet another advanced multipath that
	      connects MPLS routers.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      If the total demand offered by traffic flows exceeds the
	      capacity of the advanced multipath, the solution SHOULD
	      define a means to cause some client LSP to move to an
	      alternate set of paths that are not congested.  These
	      "preempted LSP" may not be restored if there is no
	      uncongested path in the network.
	    </t>
	  </list>
	</t>
	<t>
	  A minimally disruptive change implies that as little
	  disruption as is practical occurs.  Such a change can be
	  achieved with zero packet loss.  A delay discontinuity may
	  occur, which is considered to be a minimally disruptive
	  event for most services if this type of event is
	  sufficiently rare.  A delay discontinuity is an example of a
	  minimally disruptive behavior corresponding to current
	  techniques.
	</t>
	<t>
	  A delay discontinuity is an isolated event which may greatly
	  exceed the normal delay variation (jitter).  A delay
	  discontinuity has the following effect.  When a flow is
	  moved from a current link to a target link with lower
	  latency, reordering can occur.  When a flow is moved from a
	  current link to a target link with a higher latency, a time
	  gap can occur.  Some flows (e.g., timing distribution, PW
	  circuit emulation) are quite sensitive to these effects.  A
	  delay discontinuity can also cause a jitter buffer underrun
	  or overrun affecting user experience in real time voice
	  services (causing an audible click).  These sensitivities
	  may be specified in a Performance Objective.
	</t>
	<t>
	  As with any load balancing change, a change initiated for
	  the purpose of power reduction may be minimally disruptive.
	  Typically the disruption is limited to a change in delay
	  characteristics and the potential for a very brief period
	  with traffic reordering.  The network operator when
	  configuring a network for power reduction should weigh the
	  benefit of power reduction against the disadvantage of a
	  minimal disruption.

	    Coexistence of LDP and RSVP-TE signaled LSPs MUST be

	    RSVP signaled LSP, and LSP set up using management plane
	    mechanisms.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    When the nodes connected via an advanced multipath are in the
	    same MPLS network topology, the solution MAY define
	    extensions to the IGP.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    When the nodes are connected via an advanced multipath are in
	    different MPLS network topologies, the solution SHALL NOT
	    rely on extensions to the IGP.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    The solution SHOULD support advanced multipath IGP
	    advertisement that results in convergence time better than
	    that of advertising the individual component links.  The
	    solution SHALL be designed so that it represents the range
	    of capabilities of the individual component links such
	    that functional requirements are met, and also minimizes
	    the frequency of advertisement updates which may cause IGP
	    convergence to occur.

	    <vspace blankLines="1" /> Examples of advertisement update
	    triggering events to be considered include: client LSP
	    establishment/release, changes in component link
	    characteristics (e.g., latency, up/down state), and/or
	    bandwidth utilization.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    When a worst case failure scenario occurs, the number of
	    RSVP-TE client LSPs to be resignaled will cause a period of
	    unavailability as perceived by users. The resignaling time
	    of the solution MUST support protocol mechanisms meeting
	    existing provider Performance Objective for the duration
	    of unavailability without significantly relaxing those
	    existing Performance Objectives for the same network or
	    for networks with similar topology. For example, the
	    processing load due to IGP readvertisement MUST NOT
	    increase significantly and the resignaling time of the
	    solution MUST NOT increase significantly as compared with
	    current methods.
