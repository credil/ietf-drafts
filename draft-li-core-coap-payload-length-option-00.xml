    <abstract>
      <t>
   This document defines an extension to the Constrained Application
   Protocol (CoAP) to add one new option: Payload-Length,
    which is used to indicate the length of the payload of the message.
     </t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
      This specification adds one new option to the Constrained
      Application Protocol (CoAP): Payload-Length.
      </t>

      <section title="Motivation">
        <t>
        If a CoAP message is transported through UDP, the message length can 
        be obtained from the UDP header. But not all transport mechanisms 
        provide an unambiguous length of the CoAP message. 
        For example, in industry field, there are some data tranport protocols,
        like RS232, RS422, RS485, 
        which don't provide message length indication.      
        For these cases,
        an indication of the payload length of the message is needed in CoAP 
        message level.  
        </t> 
        <t>TBD: how about CAN bus protocol, USB 2.0?  </t>
        <t>
        With this option, it will be easier for the receiver to extract the 
        payload part from the whole message.
        </t>
        <t> 
        Another benefit to have this option is to check the integrity of 
        the message length.     
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Terminology">
	    <t>
	  The terms CoAP Server and CoAP Client are used synonymously
	  to Server and Client as specified in the terminology section
	  of <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap" />.
	    </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119"/>.
        </t>
      </section> 
    </section>

    <section title="Option Definition">
       <figure>
         <artwork>
    +--------+-----+----------------+-----------+--------+---------+
    | Number | C/E |      Name      | Data type | Length | Default |
    +--------+-----+----------------+-----------+--------+---------+
    |  TBD   |  E  | Payload-Length | uint      | 0-2 B  |         |
    +--------+-----+----------------+-----------+--------+---------+
         </artwork>
      </figure> 
      
      <t>
      If this option is present, the value of this option is an unsigned
      integer giving the length of the payload of the message. Note that
      this integer can be zero for a zero-length payload, which can in turn
       be represented by a zero-length option value.  
      </t> 
      
      <t>
      The Payload-Length option does not have a default value, so in case 
      of its absence the receiver MUST determine the payload length 
      through other means. This is to keep backward compatibility. If the 
      option is absent, the payload can have any size, and the payload length
       needs to be determined as it is currently done for UDP.
      </t>
      
      <t>
      The minimum payload length is 0, and the maximum payload length is
      2^16-1= 65535.
      </t>
      
     <t>
     In case that the transport layer does not provide message length 
     indication, the Payload-Length option SHOULD be included in the 
     CoAP message. Otherwise, it MAY be included.
     </t>
      
     <t> This options can be used both in the request and response. </t> 
      
     <t> This option MUST NOT occur more than once. </t>
     

    </section>

    <section title="Example">
     
     <t>
     In the example below, in the GET request, the payload is empty, 
     so the Payload-Length option has a zero-length option payload.
     In the response, the payload is "22.3 C", and the Payload-Length
     is 6.
