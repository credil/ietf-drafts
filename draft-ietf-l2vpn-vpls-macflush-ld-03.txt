Abstract

   MAC Address Withdrawal is a mechanism described in [RFC4762] to
   remove or unlearn MAC addresses that have been dynamically learned in
   a VPLS instance, for faster convergence on topology change.  Failure
   of mechanisms that control loop free connectivity among VPLS PE-rs
   nodes may cause MAC Address Withdrawal messages looping among those
   nodes, leading to Denial of Service (DoS) or complete failure of
   control plane in the PE-rs nodes.  This document describes a
   mechanism to detect and prevent loops of MAC Address Withdrawal
   messages in a VPLS PE-rs node on such failures.

1.  Introduction

   A method of Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is described in
   [RFC4762].  A full mesh of Pseudowire (PW)s is established between
   PE-rs (Provider Edge - Routing and Switching Capable) nodes to
   construct the VPLS core.  The mesh topology provides a LAN segment or
   broadcast domain that is fully capable of learning and forwarding
   based on Ethernet MAC addresses at the PE-rs nodes.  Since every
   PE-rs node is now directly connected to every other PE-rs nodes in
   the core via a PW, the topology forms a loop in data plane.  A simple
   loop breaking rule is used - the "spilt horizon" rule described in
   section 4.4 in [RFC4762], whereby a PE-rs node does not forward
   traffic from one PW to another in the same VPLS mesh.  Various
   mechanisms used to enforce split-horizon rule in the VPLS full mesh
   are out of scope of this document.

   For scalability, this VPLS full mesh core configuration can be
   augmented with additional non-meshed spoke or MTU-s (Multi-Tenant
   Unit - Switching Capable) [RFC4762] nodes to provide a Hierarchical
   VPLS (H-VPLS) service [RFC4762].  "Spoke" PW connecting the MTU-s
   node and "hosting" PE-rs node can forward traffic to and receive
   traffic from a "Mesh" PW in the VPLS core.  To protect from
   connection failure of the spoke PW or the hosting PE-rs node, the
   MTU-s node may be dual-homed into two PE-rs nodes in the same VPLS
   instance (see Figure 1).  The dual homed connectivity also forms a
   loop that requires a loop breaking mechanism.  The various loop
   breaking mechanisms used in H-VPLS dual homing are out of scope of
   this document.

   MAC Address Withdrawal [RFC4762] is required to remove or unlearn MAC
   addresses for faster convergence on topology change in H-VPLS (e.g.,
   failure of the primary spoke PW for a dual-homed MTU-s).  In this
   document the term "MAC Flush Message" means the LDP Address Withdraw
   Message MAC List TLV used for MAC Address Withdrawal in VPLS.

   Lack of of mechanisms or failure of mechanisms that control data
   plane loop free connectivity among VPLS PE-rs nodes may also cause
   loops of MAC Flush Messages in the LDP control plane among the
   participating PE-rs nodes.  Such looping of MAC Flush Messages may is
   similar to denial of service (DoS) attacks which may lead to complete
   failure of the control plane in the node(s). This document describes
   the looping problem with MAC Flush Messages and defines a mechanism
   to detect and prevent such loops in the LDP control plane.

   Note misconfiguration in VPLS networks may cause loops and broadcast
   storms in traffic forwarding as well.  Data path loop detection and
   prevention is outside the scope of this document.  Implementations
   may deploy methodologies available in native service forwarding to

   detect and prevent such loops in data path.  The control plane may
   not necessarily benefit from these capabilities since the control
   messages are handled differently at each hop.


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC5036] and
   [RFC4762].

   Throughout this document VPLS means the emulated bridged LAN service
   offered to a customer.  H-VPLS means the hierarchical Connectivity or
   layout of MTU-s and PE devices offering the VPLS [RFC4762].

   The terms spoke node and MTU-s in H-VPLS are used interchangeably.

   "Spoke PW" means the PW that provides connectivity between MTU-s and
   PE-rs nodes.

   "Mesh PW" means the PW that provides connectivity between PE-rs nodes
   in a VPLS full mesh core.

   "MAC Flush Message" means LDP Address Withdraw Message with MAC List
   TLV with MAC List TLV.

   MAC Flush Message in the "context of a PW" means the Message that has
   been received over the LDP session that is used to set up the PW used
   to provide connectivity in VPLS.  The MAC Flush Message carries the
   context of the PW in terms on FEC TLV associated with the PW
   [RFC4762][RFC4447].

   In general, "MAC Flush" means the method of initiating and processing
   of MAC Flush Messages across a VPLS instance.

           Figure 1: Dual homed MTU-s in two tier hierarchy H-VPLS

   An example of usage of the MAC Flush mechanism is the dual-homed
   H-VPLS where an edge node termed as MTU-s is connected to two hosting
   PE-rs nodes via primary spoke PW and backup spoke PW respectively
   (see Figure 1).  This model is described in [RFC4762].

   Such redundancy is designed to protect against the failure of primary
   spoke PW or hosting primary PE-rs node.  There could be multiple
   methods of dual homing in H-VPLS that are not described in [RFC4762].
   For example, note the following statement from section 10.2.1 in
   [RFC4762]:

   "How a spoke is designated primary or secondary is outside the scope
   of this document.  For example, a spanning tree instance running
   between only the MTU-s and the two PE-rs nodes is one possible
   method.  Another method could be configuration".

   When the MTU-s switches over to the backup PW (activates the backup
   PW), it is required to flush the MAC addresses learned in the
   corresponding VSI (Virtual Switch Instance) in all PE-rs devices
   participating in full mesh, to avoid black holing of frames to those

   addresses.

   In Figure 1, the MTU-s is dual-homed to PE1-rs and PE2-rs.  Only the
   primary spoke PW is active at MTU-s, thus PE1-rs is acting as the
   active device (designated forwarder) to reach the full mesh in the
   VPLS instance.  The MAC addresses of nodes located at access sites
   (behind CE1 and CE2) are learned at PE1-rs over the primary spoke PW.
   Let's say X represents a set of such MAC addresses located behind
   CE-1.  As packets flow from X to Z, PE2-rs, PE3-rs and PE4-rs learn
   about X on their respective mesh PWs terminating at PE1-rs.  When
   MTU-s switches to the backup spoke PW and activates it, PE2-rs
   becomes the active device (designated forwarder) to reach the full
   mesh core.  Traffic entering the H-VPLS from CE-1 and CE-2 is
   diverted by the MTU-s to the spoke PW to PE2-rs.  Traffic destined
   from PE2-rs, PE3-rs and PE4-rs to X will be blackholed till MAC
   address ageing timer expires (default is 5 minutes) or a packet flows
   from X to Z through PE2-rs.

   To avoid traffic blackholing the MAC addresses that have been learned
   in the upstream VPLS full-mesh through PE1-rs, those addresses must
   be relearned or removed from the MAC FIBs in the VSIs at PE2-rs,
   PE3-rs and PE4-rs.  This is accomplished by sending a MAC Flush
   Message with the list of MAC addresses to be removed to all PE-rs
   devices in the VPLS.  In order to minimize the impact on LDP
   convergence time and scalability when a MAC List TLV contains a large
   number of MAC addresses, many implementations use a MAC Flush Message
   with an empty MAC List.

3.1.  MTU-s Initiated MAC Flush

   When dual homing in H-VPLS is achieved by manual configuration in
   MTU-S node, the hosting PE-rs nodes are dual homing "agnostic".  It
   is the MTU-s node that controls the primary and backup status of
   spoke PWs connected to PE1-rs and PE2-rs respectively.  In figure 1,
   PE2-rs can send and receive traffic over the backup spoke PW any time
   and only MTU-s blocks the traffic on the spoke PW at its end.  For
   example Broadcast, Unicast Unlearned and Multicast (BUM) traffic
   received from the VPLS core is continually forwarded by PE3-rs node
   over the backup spoke PW to get it dropped by MTU-s node.

   Therefore PE2-rs node (PE-rs node with now-active PW) cannot initiate
   MAC Flush message on activation of backup PW by MTU-s.  When the
   backup PW is made active by the MTU-s node, it initiates a MAC Flush
   Message to PE2-rs node.  The Message is sent over in the context of
   the newly activated spoke PW.  On receiving the MAC Flush Message
   from MTU-s node, PE2-rs node would flush all the MAC addresses it has
   learned except the ones learned over the newly activated spoke PW
   (Here it is assumed that MTU-s initiated a MAC Flush Message with

   empty MAC List).  PE2-rs node further "propagates" the MAC Flush
   Message to all other PE-rs nodes in the VPLS core to incur the same
   MAC flushing action in peer PE-rs nodes.

   The MAC Flush forwarding rules in LDP control plane strictly follow
   the "split-horizon" forwarding rules in H-VPLS data plane (Refer to
   section 4.4 in [RFC4762]).  So a MAC Flush is forwarded in the
   context of mesh PW(s) only when it is received in the context of a
   spoke PW.  When a PE-rs node receives a MAC Flush in the context of a
   mesh PW then it is not forwarded in the control plane further - means
   not forwarded to any mesh or spoke PWs.

   MTU-s initiated method of MAC Flushing is modeled after Topology
   Change Notification (TCN) in Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol
   (RSTP)[IEEE.802.1Q-2011].  When a bridge switches from a failed link
   to the backup link, the bridge sends out a TCN message over the newly
   activated link.  The upstream bridge upon receiving this message
   flushes its entire MAC addresses except the ones received over this
   link and sends the TCN message out of its other ports in that
   spanning tree instance.  The message is further relayed along the
   spanning tree by the other bridges.  MTU-s initiated MAC Flushing may
   be also applicable when RSTP may be used to ensure loop free
   connectivity and failure protection between MTU-s node and host PE-rs
   node (Refer to section 11.2 in [RFC4762]).

   This method of MTU-s initiated MAC Flush is not explicitly described
   in [RFC4762], although it mentions about dual-homing with manual
   configuration or with xSTP (Any of the Spanning Tree Protocol Family)
   .  Note that forced switchover to backup spoke PW can be also
   performed at MTU-s node administratively due to maintenance
   activities on the formerly primary spoke PW.

3.1.1.  MAC Flush Loop Due to Misconfiguration

   In the figure below, PE1-rs, PE2-rs, PE3-rs and PE4-rs comprises of
   the VPLS full mesh core.  The loop free connectivity between the
   PE-rs devices is supposed to be ensured by split-horizon forwarding
   rules between mesh PWs that connects the VPLS core[RFC4762].

            Figure 2: Dual homed MTU-s in two tier hierarchy H-VPLS with
                      misconfiguration in core

   Figure 2. above describes a set of misconfigurations in the H-VPLS
   topology, which are as follows:

   1.  The PW that connects between PE2-rs and PE3-rs has been
   misconfigured at PE3-rs as spoke PW instead of mesh PW.

   2.  The PW that connects between PE3-rs and PE1-rs has been
   misconfigured at PE1-rs as spoke PW instead of mesh PW.

   3.  The PW that connects between PE1-rs and PE2-rs has been
   misconfigured at PE2-rs as spoke PW instead of mesh PW.

   Such misconfiguration can occur due to configuration error in manual
   provisioning of a VPLS instance.  Further such misconfiguration may
   also happen due to misconfiguration of the protocol(s) used to
   automate provisioning of VPLS instances.

   Note the misconfiguration now has created a loop in data plane along
   the path PE1-rs->PE2-rs->PE3-rs->PE1-rs.  An example is as follows:

   1.  BUM traffic received by PE1-rs from MTU-s over the primary spoke
   PW would be flooded to PE2-rs and PE3-rs (would be also forwarded to
   MTU-s over the backup spoke PW if PE2-rs is dual-homing agnostic).

   2.  PE2-rs on receiving the packets from PE1-rs on a spoke PW, PE2-rs
   would forward to PE3-rs over the mesh PW.

   3.  PE3-rs on receiving the packets from PE2-rs on a spoke PW, PE3-rs
   would forward to PE1-rs and PE4-rs over the respective mesh PWs.

   4.  PE1-rs on receiving the packets from PE3-rs on a spoke PW, PE1-rs
   would forward to PE2-rs and PE4-rs over the respective mesh PWs.

   Implementations may deploy several data plane loop breaking methods
   that are available in native service forwarding to break such loops
   in data path.  Data plane loop breaking methods are outside the scope
   of this document.

   In this misconfigured topology, MTU-s activates the backup spoke PW
   to PE2-rs and initiates a MAC Flush Message towards PE2-rs.  Since
   MAC flush forwarding rules are derived from the VPLS split-horizon
   rules data plane, a MAC flush loop would occur in the LDP control
   plane along PE2-rs->PE3-rs->PE1-rs->PE2-rs as follows:

   1.  PE2-rs on receiving the MAC Flush Message from MTU-s in the
   context of a spoke PW, PE2-rs would perform required flushing action
   and would forward the MAC Flush Message towards PE3-rs and PE4-rs in
   the context of respective mesh PWs.  Note that PE2-rs would also
   forward the message to PE1-rs as well since the PW connecting to
   PE1-rs has been misconfigured as spoke.

   2.  PE3-rs on receiving the MAC Flush Message from PE2-rs in the
   context of a spoke PW, PE3-rs would perform required flushing action
   and would forward the MAC Flush Message to PE1-rs and PE4-rs in the
   context of respective mesh PWs.

   3.  PE1-rs on receiving the MAC Flush Message from PE3-rs in the
   context of a spoke PW, PE1-rs would perform required flushing action
   and would forward the MAC Flush Message to PE2-rs and PE4-rs in the
   context of respective mesh PWs.

   Each such loop of a MAC Flush Message causes replication to (N-1)
   messages, where N is number of PE-rs devices a replicating PE-rs is
   connected to.  Such looping of MAC Flush Messages may lead to a
   denial of service (DoS) attacks or complete failure of the control
   plane in the node(s) and bring down services in the entire network.
   The LDP control plane in PE-rs or MTU-s nodes requires a fault
   tolerant mechanism to detect such loops and to protect against such

   failures.

3.2.  PE-rs Initiated MAC Flush

   PE-rs initiated MAC Flush [RFC4762] specifies that on failure of the
   primary PW, it is the PE2-rs node (Figure 2) that initiates MAC flush
   towards the core.  This is specified in section 10.2.2 in [RFC4762].
   However note that PE2-rs node can initiate MAC Flush only when PE2-rs
   is dual homing "aware" - that is, there is some redundancy management
   protocol running between MTU-s and its host PE-rs devices.

   The scope of this document is not specific to any dual homing
   protocols.  One example could be BGP based multi-homing in LDP based
   VPLS that uses the procedures defined in
   [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpls-multihoming].  In this method of dual-homing,
   PE3-rs would neither forward any traffic to MTU-s neither would
   receive any traffic from MTU-s while PE1-rs is acting a primary (or
   designated forwarder).

   When PE2-rs detects that the backup spoke PW is now active then
   PE2-rs initiates a MAC Flush Message towards all peer PE-rs nodes in
   the VPLS full-mesh core.  The MAC Flush Processing and Forwarding
   Rules are same as explained in section 3.1.  When a VPLS topology is
   misconfigured as described in Figure 2, a MAC Flush loop would occur
   in the same way as explained in section 3.1.1.


4.  Loop Detection in MAC Flush

   This section describes the method for Detection and Protection
   against MAC Flush loops in the control plane.

   MAC Flush Loop Detection is a configurable option in a VPLS capable
   PE-rs or MTU-s node that provides a mechanism for finding and
   preventing MAC Flush messages from looping across the VPLS network.
   The mechanism makes use of LDP Path Vector TLVs defined in [RFC5036].
   For loop detection in MAC Flush, Path Vector TLVs are carried in the
   MAC Flush Messages.

   The following shows the encoding of Path Vector TLV when used for MAC
   Flush Loop Detection.  For backward compatibility with [RFC4762] the
   U bit and F bit MUST be set as 1.

            Figure 2. Path Vector TLV in MAC Flush.

   The method builds on the following basic property of the TLV:

   - A Path Vector TLV contains a list of the PE-rs devices that the
   containing MAC Flush Message has traversed.  A PE-rs is identified in
   a Path Vector list by its unique LDP LSR Identifier (LSR-ID), which
   is the first four octets of its LDP Identifier([RFC5036]).  When a
   PE-rs propagates a MAC flush message containing a Path Vector, it
   appends its LSR-ID to the Path Vector list.  An LSR that receives a
   message with a Path Vector that contains its LSR-ID, detects that the
   message has traversed a loop.

   The following paragraphs describe the MAC Flush Loop Detection
   Procedures.  For these paragraphs, and only these paragraphs, "MUST"
   is redefined to mean "MUST if configured for Loop Detection". Further
   the term "PE-rs device" is used specify a VPLS capable PE-rs or a
   MTU-s device.

4.1.  Loop Detection Procedure in MAC Flush Message

   The rules that govern use of the Path Vector TLV are LDP MAC Flush
   messages by a PE-rs when MAC Flush Loop Detection is enabled are the
   following:

   o  If PE-rs device is originating the MAC Flush Message, it MUST
      include a Path Vector TLV of length 1 containing its own LSR-ID
      along with the MAC Flush Message originated to downstream PE-rs.

   o  If PE-rs device is propagating the MAC flush as a result of having
      received a MAC Flush from an upstream PE-rs, then:

      *  If the MAC Flush message contains no Path Vector TLV, then
         PE-rs MUST include a Path Vector TLV of length 1 containing its
         own LSR-ID along with the MAC Flush Message propagated to
         downstream PE-rs.

      *  If the MAC Flush contains a Path Vector TLV then:

Internet-Draft          MAC Flush Loop Detection              March 2013


         +  If the Path Vector TLV contains its LSR-ID then the PE-rs
            device detects the MAC flush message has traveled in a loop
            and it MUST drop the MAC Flush Message without processing,
            else

         +  If the Path Vector TLV exceeds the maximum allowable length,
            then the PE-rs device detects that the MAC flush message has
            traveled in a loop and it MUST drop the MAC Flush Message
            without processing, else,

         +  the TLV PE-rs device MUST add its own LSR ID to the Path
            Vector, and MUST pass the resulting Path Vector to its
            downstream PE-rs along with the propagated MAC flush
            message.

   By the definition of Path Vector TLV in [RFC5036], it supports the
   notion of a maximum allowable Path Vector Length; a PE-rs node that
   detects a Path Vector has reached the maximum length behaves as if
   containing message has traversed a loop.  Such limit MAY be a locally
   configurable option in an implementation based on the scope of H-VPLS
   topology.  The limit MAY also be driven by payload size limitations
   of MAC flush messages.


5.  Applicability

   If MAC Flush Loop Detection is desired in VPLS Network, then it
   should be enabled on all PE-rs nodes within that VPLS Network,
   otherwise Loop Detection will not operate properly and may result in
   undetected loops or in falsely detected loops.

   PE-rs nodes that are configured for MAC Flush Loop Detection are not
   expected to store the Path Vectors as part of the VPLS service.

   There could be other H-VPLS topologies where the problem and the
   solution described in this document may be applicable.
