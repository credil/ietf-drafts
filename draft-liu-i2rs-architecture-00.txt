1.  Introduction

   This document discusses the high level architecture of I2RS.  As
   illustrated in figure 1, the I2RS architecture is composed by three
   types of building blocks.  The first type of the building block is
   the user of I2RS interface.  The users could be network controllers,
   network management functions, other user applications etc.  The user
   application uses the I2RS interface interacts with the routing
   system.  The second type of the building block is management
   functions.  This include configuration management function and
   security managment function.  The configuration management function
   is used to configure the I2RS interface.  The security function is
   used to enforce the security polices of the I2RS interface.  The
   third type of the building block is routing function.  This build
   block includes routing information base, IP forwarding table etc.
   The routing information base could be accessed by the I2RS users
   using the I2RS interface.

3.  Architecture of I2RS

   This section discusses the function of the building block of the I2RS
   architecture.

   1.  I2RS user application

   The I2RS user application communicate with the routing information
   base using the I2RS interface.  The user application can read the
   routing information from the routing information base, it can also
   inject polices, routing information etc into the routing information
   base.  The I2RS interface could be RESTful API or websocket etc.
   There should be an authentication mechanism in the I2RS architecture
   that only allow the authorized application communicate with the
   routing system.

   2.  Configuration function

   The I2RS interface could be configured by the configuration function.
   The I2RS user application could customize the I2RS interface function
   and set the I2RS interface parameters by the configuration function.

   3.  Security function

   Security function is an important building block of the I2RS
   architecture.  It will ensure only authorized application can use the
   I2RS interface and communicate with the routing system.  There could
   be different level of authorization.  For example, the security
   function can allow some application only read from the routing system
   while other application can both read and inject polices into the
   routing system.

   4.  Routing function

   The routing function is composed of routing informatio base, IP
   forwarding table and the routing processes.  The I2RS application
   could communicate with the routing information base using the I2RS
   interface.  It can read or inject routing information into the

   routing information base.  The routing processes can also inject
   routing information into the routing information base.


4.  Security Considerations

   Security function is very important for the I2RS architecture.  It
   should provide authenticatin mechanism and data protection mechanism
   to protect critical routing information.


5.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA action is required.
