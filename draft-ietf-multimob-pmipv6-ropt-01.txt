     Multicast Mobility Routing Optimizations for Proxy Mobile IPv6
                   draft-ietf-multimob-pmipv6-ropt-01

Abstract

   The MULTIMOB group has specified a base solution to support IP
   multicasting in a PMIPv6 domain [RFC6224].  In this document, some
   enhancements to the base solution are described.  These enhancements
   include the use of a multicast tree mobility anchor as the
   topological anchor point for multicast traffic, as well as a direct
   routing option where the MAG can provide access to multicast content
   in the local network.  These enhancements provide benefits such as
   reducing multicast traffic replication and supporting different
   PMIPv6 deployments scenarios.

Internet-Draft  Multicast Mobility Routing Optimizations  September 2012


1.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] is a network-based approach to solving
   the IP mobility problem.  In a Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) domain, the
   Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) behaves as a proxy mobility agent in the
   network and does the mobility management on behalf of the Mobile Node
   (MN).  The Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) is the home agent for the MN
   and the topological anchor point.  PMIPv6 was originally designed for
   unicast traffic.  However, a PMIPv6 domain may handle data from both
   unicast and multicast sources.

   The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMPv3) [RFC3376] is used by
   IPv4 hosts to report their IP multicast group memberships to
   neighboring multicast routers.  Multicast Listener Discovery (MLDv2)
   [RFC3810] is used in a similar way by IPv6 routers to discover the
   presence of IPv6 multicast hosts.  Also, the IGMP/MLD proxy [RFC4065]
   allows an intermediate (i.e. edge) node to appear as a multicast
   router to downstream hosts, and as a host to upstream multicast
   routers.  IGMP and MLD related protocols however were not originally
   designed to address IP mobility of multicast listeners (i.e.  IGMP
   and MLD protocols were originally designed for fixed networks).

   The MULTIMOB group has specified a base solution to support IP
   multicast listener mobility in a PMIPv6 domain [RFC6224], which
   describes deployment options without modifying mobility and multicast
   protocol standards.  The PMIPv6 allows a MAG to establish multiple
   PMIPv6 tunnels with different LMAs, e.g. up to one per MN.  In the
   presence of multicast traffic, multiple instances of the same traffic
   can converge to the same MAG.  Hence, when IP multicasting is applied
   into PMIPv6, it leads to redundant traffic at a MAG.  This is the so-
   called "Tunnel Convergence problem".

   To address this issue, a comprehensive solution is proposed in this
   document, consisting of two complementary enhancements: multicast
   anchor and direct routing.  The former uses a multicast tree mobility
   anchor (MTMA) as the topological anchor point for remotely delivering
   multicast traffic, while the latter uses direct routing taking
   advantage of local multicast source availability, allowing a MAG to
   connect directly to a multicast router for simple access to local
   content.  Neither of the schemes has any impact on the MN to support
   multicast listener mobility.

   The MTMA details are described in section 3.  Section 4 describes the
   direct routing technique.  Section 5 describes the details about the
   dynamic selection at the MAG between direct routing (e.g. for local
   access) and MTMA (e.g. for remote access).

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC5213], [RFC6275],
   and [RFC3810].  Specifically, the definition of PMIPv6 domain is
   reused from [RFC5213] and reproduced here for completeness.

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 Domain (PMIPv6-Domain):  Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain
      refers to the network where the mobility management of a mobile
      node is handled using the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol as defined in
      [RFC5213].  The Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain includes local mobility
      anchors and mobile access gateways between which security
      associations can be set up and authorization for sending Proxy
      Binding Updates on behalf of the mobile nodes can be ensured.

   In this draft we refine such definition from the point of view of the
   kind of traffic served to the MN in the following way:

   PMIPv6 unicast domain:  PMIPv6 unicast domain refers to the network
      covered by one LMA for unicast service.  This service allows MN
      mobility as it moves from one MAG to another associated to that
      LMA regarding its unicast traffic.

   PMIPv6 multicast domain:  PMIPv6 multicast domain refers to the
      network covered by one network element named MTMA (defined below)
      for multicast service in such a way that an MN using that service
      is not aware of mobility as it moves from one MAG to another.

   From the definitions above, it can stated that a PMIPv6 domain can
   have several PMIPv6 unicast domains and PMIPv6 multicast domains.
   Additionally, some other definitions are introduced, as follows.

   MTMA or multicast tree mobility anchor:  an entity working as
      topological anchor point for multicast traffic.

   H-LMA or Hybrid-LMA:  an entity dedicated to both unicast and
      multicast services, that is, it is able to work as both LMA and
      MTMA simultaneously.

   Direct routing:  it uses native multicast infrastructure for
      retrieving multicast data.  For the operator having its own local
      content, this technique also includes the case that content source
      is directly connected to a MAG.

3.  Multicast Tree Mobility Anchor (MTMA)

   An MTMA can be used to serve as the mobility anchor for multicast
   traffic.  Typically, the MTMA will be used to get access to multicast
   content remotely.

   The MTMA connects to the MAG as described in [RFC6224] and it can
   reuse native PMIPv6 features such as tunnel establishment and
   security [RFC5213], heartbeat [RFC5847], etc.  Unicast traffic will
   go normally to the LMAs in the PMIPv6 domain as described in
   [RFC5213].

   This section describes how the MTMA works in scenarios of MN
   attachment and multicast mobility.  It concentrates on the case of
   both LMA and MTMA defining a unique PMIPv6 domain.  Some other
   different deployment scenarios are presented in Appendix A.

3.1.  Overview

   Figure 1 shows an example of a PMIPv6 domain supporting multicast
   mobility.  The LMA is dedicated to unicast traffic, and the MTMA is
   dedicated to multicast traffic.  The MTMA can be considered to be a
   form of upstream multicast router with tunnel interfaces allowing
   remote subscription for the MNs.  Note that there can be multiple
   LMAs for unicast traffic in a given PMIPv6 domain (not shown in
   Figure 1 for simplicity).  Similarly, more than one MTMA could be
   deployed by the operator (not shown in Figure 1).

   As shown in Figure 1, MAG1 may connect to both unicast (LMAs) and
   multicast (MTMAs) entities.  Thus, a given MN may simultaneously
   receive both unicast and multicast traffic.  In Figure 1, MN1 and MN2
   receive unicast traffic, multicast traffic, or both, whereas MN3
   receives multicast traffic only.

3.2.  Operations of the Mobile Node

   The MN operation is not impacted by the existence of an MTMA as
   anchor for the multicast traffic being subscribed.  The MN will act
   according to the stated operations in [RFC5213] and [RFC6224].

   This draft considers that every MN requesting multicast-only services
   is previously registered in a PMIPv6 unicast domain to get a unicast
   IP address.  The registration can also be required also for several
   purposes such as remote management, billing, etc.

3.3.  Operations of the Mobile Access Gateway

   There are two main functionalities in the MAG when it is connected to
   an MTMA.  One when the MAG incorporates MLD proxy functions as per
   [RFC4605].  The other case is when the MAG functions as a multicast
   router as per [RFC4601] or [RFC4607].

   The following sections describe the MAG for both cases in more
   detail.

3.3.1.  MAG as MLD Proxy

   If the MAG has MLD proxy functionality only, once the MLD proxy
   instance is configured to obtain the multicast traffic remotely from
   the MTMA, the system behavior remains static.

   In case of remote subscription, all MAGs that are connected to the
   MTMA must support the MLD proxy [RFC4605] function.  Specifically in
   Figure 1, each of the MAG1-MTMA and MAG2-MTMA tunnel interfaces
   define an MLD proxy domain.  The MNs are considered to be on the
   downstream interface of the MLD proxy (of the MAG), and the MTMA is
   considered to be on the upstream interface (of the MAG) as per
   [RFC4605].  Note that the MAG could also be an IGMP proxy.  For
   brevity this document will refer primarily to MLD proxy, but all
   references to "MLD proxy" should be understood to also include "IGMP/
   MLD proxy" functionality.

3.3.1.1.  Multicast Establishment

   Figure 2 shows the procedure when MN1 attaches to MAG, and
   establishes associations with LMA (unicast) and MTMA (multicast).

   Figure 2: MN Attachment and Multicast Service Establishment for MTMA

   In Figure 2, MAG first establishes the PMIPv6 tunnel with LMA for
   unicast traffic as defined in [RFC5213] after being triggered by the
   Router Solicitation message from MN1.  Unicast traffic will then flow
   between MN1 and LMA.

   For multicast traffic, a multicast tunnel may have been pre-
   configured between MAG and MTMA, or may be dynamically established
   when the first MN appears at the MAG.

   MN1 sends the MLD report message (when required by its upper layer
   applications) as defined in [RFC3810] in response to an MLD Query
   from MAG.  The MAG, acting as a MLD Proxy defined in [RFC4605], will
   then send an Aggregated MLD Report to the multicast anchor, MTMA
   (assuming that this is a new multicast group which the MAG had not
   previously subscribed to).  Multicast traffic will then flow from the

   MTMA towards MN1.

3.3.1.2.  Multicast Mobility

   Figure 3 illustrates the mobility scenario for multicast traffic.
   Specifically, MN2 with ongoing multicast subscription moves from MAG1
   to MAG2.  Note that, for simplicity, in this scenario we only
   consider the tunnel of MAG2 with MTMA (for multicast traffic) and we
   does not show any unicast traffic.  Of course, if it was desired to
   support unicast traffic, it would be served by a tunnel between MAG2
   and LMA.

   According to the baseline solution signaling method described in
   [RFC6224], after MN2 mobility, MAG2 acting in its role of MLD proxy
   will send an MLD Query to the newly observed MN on its downlink.
   Assuming that the subsequent MLD Report from MN2 requests membership
   for a new multicast group (from MAG2's point of view), this will then
   result in an Aggregated MLD Report being sent to the MTMA from MAG2.
   This message will be sent through a multicast tunnel between MAG2 and
   MTMA (pre-established or dynamically established) .

   When MN2 detaches, MAG1 may keep the multicast tunnel with the
   multicast MTMA if there are still other MNs using the multicast
   tunnel.  Even if there are no MNs currently on the multicast tunnel,
   MAG1 may decide to keep the multicast tunnel for potential future
   use.

   As discussed above, existing MLD (and MLD proxy) signaling will
   handle a large part of the multicast mobility management for the MN.

3.3.2.  MAG as Multicast Router

   If the MAG is a multicast router, the system behavior when operating
   with remote subscription is as described before, considering that a
   multicast routing protocol is running between the MAG and the MTMA on
   the tunnel interface.  Even once the MAG has decided to obtain the
   multicast traffic remotely based for instance on routing information
   and/or network management criteria, this decision can be dynamically
   changed if such criteria changes.  This behavior is further described
   in section Section 6.2.

3.4.  Operations of the Multicast Tree Mobility Anchor

   The MTMA provides connectivity to the multicast infrastructure out of
   the PMIPv6 domain.  The MTMA itself could either act as an additional
   MLD proxy (only in the case where all the connected MAGs act also as
   MLD proxies), reporting to a further node an aggregated view of the
   subscriptions in a PMIPv6 multicast domain; or it can act as a
   designated multicast router for all the MAGs in a PMIPv6 multicast
   domain.  The MTMA will then request the multicast content on behalf
   of the MAGs (and MNs behind them).  In addition, the MTMA will create
   and maintain the corresponding multicast forwarding states per each
   tunnel interface towards the MAGs.  Whatever the role played, when
   the MAGs act as MLD proxy, the MTMA becomes the MLD querier of the
   MLD proxy instance located in each MAG.


4.  Direct Routing

   Direct routing uses native multicast infrastructure, allowing a MAG
   to directly connect a multicast router in the PMIPv6 domain.  A MAG
   can act as a MLD proxy or multicast router for redirecting multicast
   packets.

   The main purpose of direct routing is to provide optimal routing for
   local content.  As a consequence, it alleviates the MTMA of the
   channel management and data delivery of locally available content.
   Unicast traffic will go normally to the LMAs in the PMIPv6 domain.

   This section describes how the direct routing works in scenarios of
   MN attachment and multicast mobility.

4.1.  Overview

   Figure 4 shows the architecture for the local routing case using
   native multicasting infrastructure
   [I-D.deng-multimob-pmip6-requirement].

   The LMA is dedicated to unicast traffic, and the multicast traffic is
   obtained from an upstream multicast router present in the PMIPv6
   domain.  Note that there can be multiple LMAs for unicast traffic
   (not shown in Figure 1) in a given PMIPv6 domain.

   As shown in Figure 4, a MAG may connect to both unicast (LMA) and
   multicast (MR) nodes.  Thus, a given MN may simultaneously receive
   both unicast and multicast traffic.

   As seen in Figure 4, each MAG has a direct connection (i.e., not
   using the tunnel interface) with a multicast router.  To facilitate

   IGMP/MLD signaling and multicast packets forwarding, a MLD proxy
   function defined in [RFC4605], or multicast routing function SHOULD
   be placed on the MAG.

4.2.  Operations of the Mobile Node

   The MN operation is not impacted by the direct routing option.  The
   MN will act according to the stated operations in [RFC5213] and
   [RFC6224].

   This draft considers that every MN requesting multicast-only services
   is previously registered in a PMIPv6 unicast domain to get a unicast
   IP address.  This registration can also be required for several
   purposes such as remote management, billing, etc.

4.3.  Operations of the Mobile Access Gateway

   There are two main functionalities in the MAG when it supports direct
   routing.  One is the when the MAG incorporates MLD proxy functions as
   per [RFC4605].  The other case is when the MAG functions as a

Internet-Draft  Multicast Mobility Routing Optimizations  September 2012


   multicast router as per [RFC4601] or [RFC4607].

   The following sections describe the MAG for both cases in more
   detail.

4.3.1.  MAG as MLD Proxy

   In case the MAG only incorporates MLD proxy functionality, for every
   one of the MLD proxy instances invoked in the MAG it is necessary to
   define at configuration time the upstream interface from where the
   multicast traffic will be received.  This decision requires to define
   whether the multicast subscription by an MLD proxy instance for all
   the multicast channels will be local (if the upstream interface
   points to a multicast router internal to the PMIPv6 domain) or remote
   (in case of the upstream interface is the bi-directional tunnel
   towards the LMA, for the architecture in [RFC6224], or the MTMA, for
   the multicast listener optimization described in this document).

4.3.1.1.  Multicast Establishment

   If the MAG has MLD proxy functionality only, once the MLD proxy
   instance is configured to obtain the multicast traffic locally, the
   system behavior remains static.

   In Figure 5, the MAG first establishes the PMIPv6 tunnel with LMA for
   unicast traffic as defined in [RFC5213] after being triggered by the
   Router Solicitation message from the MN.  Unicast traffic will then
   flow between the MN and LMA.

   For multicast traffic, it is assumed that the upstream interface of
   the MLD proxy instance has been configured pointing to a multicast
   router internal to the PMIPv6 domain (or towards an additional MLD
   proxy node in the domain), for all the multicast channels (which, in
   consequence, have to be local).  There should be direct connectivity
   between the MAG and the local multicast router (or additional MLD
   proxy).

   Upon detecting node attachment from an incoming interface, the MAG
   adds each downstream interface to the MLD Proxy instance with
   upstream link to a MR according to the standard MLD proxy operations
   and sends an MLD Query message towards the MN.  The MN sends the MLD
   report message (when required by its upper layer applications) as
   defined in [RFC3810] in response to an MLD Query from MAG.Upon
   receiving the MLD Report message from each incoming interface, the
   MAG checks the MLD Proxy instance associated with the downstream
   interface and then the MLD Report messages will be aggregated and
   forwarded to the upstream link associated with the MR (assuming that
   this is a new multicast group which the MAG had not previously

   multicast router towards the MN.

         Figure 6: Multicast mobility signaling for direct routing

   Figure 6 shows the handover operation procedure in the local direct
   routing architecture.  When an MN hands off to the next MAG (N-MAG)
   from the previous MAG (P-MAG), the N-MAG detects the newly arrived
   attached MN and performs binding update procedure by exchanging PBU/
   PBA signaling messages with LMA.  At the same time, a MLD Proxy
   instance detecting the new MN transmits an MLD query message to the
   MN.  After receiving the MLD query message, the MN sends an MLD
   report message that includes the multicast group information.  The
   N-MAG then sends an aggregated MLD report message to the upstream
   link associated with the MR.  In the direct routing case, an upstream
   interface of MLD Proxy instance is decided towards certain multicast
   router based on the operator's configuration or multicast routing, as

   compared to the base solution defined in [RFC6224] where it is
   determined for each MN based on the Proxy Binding Update List.  When
   the N-MAG receives the multicast packets from the MR, it then simply
   forwards them without tunnel encapsulation.  The N-MAG updates the
   MN's location information to the LMA by exchanging PBU/PBA signaling
   messages.

4.3.2.  MAG as multicast router

   If the MAG behaves as a multicast router, the MAG then implements a
   multicast routing protocol.  This allows the MAG to make decisions
   about from where to receive the traffic of any multicast channel,
   based on routing information and/or network management criteria.  The
   selected incoming interface for receiving multicast traffic will be
   then the one matching such criteria, and it could drive to either a
   local or remote subscription.  Some situations are introduced in the
   next section.

   If the MAG is a multicast router, the system behavior when operating
   with local subscription is as before, but extending the role of the
   MAG to be a multicast router, and running a multicast routing
   protocol among the MAG and local multicast router serving the
   multicast traffic.  Once the MAG decides to obtain the multicast
   traffic locally based in routing information and/or network
   management criteria, this can be dynamically changed if such criteria
   change.


5.  Functions and Requirements

   A set of new functions and structures are needed in PMIPv6 to allow
   the use of the solution described in this document.  The following
   sub-sections describe these required extensions.

5.1.  Extension to the Binding Update List in MAG

   The Binding Update List in the MAG must be updated to be able to
   handle the fact that more than one entity (i.e.  LMA and MTMA) may be
   serving the mobile node.

5.2.  Extension of the Policy Profile Information including multicast
      related parameters

   A given mobile node's policy profile information must be updated to
   be able to store the IPv6 addresses of both the LMA and MTMA, for the
   remote subscription case.

   Additionally, when the MAG act as multicast router in the local



Zuniga, et al.           Expires March 15, 2013                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft  Multicast Mobility Routing Optimizations  September 2012


   subscription case it is required to keep registration of the IP
   address for the rendez-vous point in the PMIPv6 domain, when PIM-SM
   is used.  When using PIM-SSM, the IP addresses of the local multicast
   sources have to be also registered.

5.3.  Data Structure in MTMA

   The MTMA does not directly interact with the MNs attached to any of
   the MAGs.  The MTMA only manages the multicast groups subscribed per
   MAG on behalf of the MNs attached to it.  Having this in mind, the
   relevant information to be stored in the MTMA should be the tunnel
   interface identifier (tunnel-if-id) of the bi-directional tunnel for
   multicast between the MTMA and every MAG (e.g. similar to what it is
   stated in [RFC5213] for the unicast case), the IP addresses of the
   multicast group delivered per tunnel to each of the MAGs, and the IP
   addresses of the sources injecting the multicast traffic per tunnel
   to the multicast domain defined by the MTMA.


6.  Dynamic Selection Support

   As mentioned above, the MAG as multicast router provides some
   flexibility for choosing local versus remote multicast subscription.
   With this approach IP multicast traffic can selectively be received
   from the home, visited or local domains, and the selection of traffic
   can be based on operator policies.  Considering PIM as the multicast
   routing protocol running on the MAG, it is possible to find out two
   situations where such dynamic selection can occur, according to the
   PIM flavor on place.  For all the scenarios below we consider a
   certain multicast flow being injected by two different sources, one
   local to the PMIPv6 domain and one remote through the home network,
   by using an MTMA.

6.1.  Use Cases

   The MAG has different options to subscribe to a multicast group, such
   as:

      - Via the tunnel with the LMA unicast [RFC6224]

      - Via the tunnel with the MTMA (as described in Section 3)

      - Via local subscription/routing (as described in Section 4)

   Also, the content can be located in different places.  For instance,
   the content might be locally available (e.g.  TV channels offered in
   the visited domain), or the content might be remote (e.g.  TV
   channels offered in the home domain).  In case the content is



Zuniga, et al.           Expires March 15, 2013                [Page 18]

Internet-Draft  Multicast Mobility Routing Optimizations  September 2012


   available remotely at the home network it is preferred to subscribe
   via the MTMA tunnel to home.  However, if the content is available
   locally, it is preferred to subscribe at the MAG (local break point)
   instead of via the home network.  The MAG may therefore have to
   choose which approach needs to be taken to subscribe to a particular
   content requested by a particular MN.

      - If the IP address of the source injecting a certain multicast
      group is local (scope: local domain), the MAG should get access to
      it via local subscription (or routing, if the MAG is a multicast
      router).

      - If IP address of the source injecting a certain multicast group
      is global (or the scope is broader than the local domain), the MAG
      may have to decide among the different available options (i.e.
      RFC6224, Local Routing, or MTMA).  This can be achieved through
      some static or dynamic configuration at the MAG.

6.2.  Any Source Multicast Scenario

   This situation applies for both PIM-SM and BIDIR PIM variants.  In
   this case, once the MAG receives the MLD report from the MN
   requesting the multicast channel in the form (*,G), the MAG could
   decide what multicast flow subscribes to (either the local or the
   remote one).

   The subscription can be statically pre-configured or dynamically
   configured based on some rule.  For instance, static configuration
   can be made per MN (user), such as "multicast traffic from user X
   should always go through the home (i.e., via the tunnel with the
   MTMA/LMA-as-per-RFC6224), while traffic from user Y should go via
   local subscription".  Also, configuration profiles can also be more
   complex and include considerations on types of traffic or IP flows,
   such as "traffic of type A from user X should always go through the
   home, traffic of type B from user X should be subscribed locally"
   using routing information and/or network management criteria.
   Similarly, routing information can be received dynamically.  For
   example, at user's registration time PBU/PBA signaling can be used to
   carry the profile information similar to what is described in
   [I-D.ietf-netext-pmipv6-sipto-option].  Also, routing information can
   be exchanged dynamically when the multicast group subscription is
   made.

   In case of using PIM-SM, another scenario is possible.  PIM-SM allows
   switching from a multicast shared-tree to a source-specific tree to
   optimize the path for traffic delivery.  The location of the
   rendezvous point and the multicast source can either be in the PMIPv6
   domain or the home network, so the optimization could be from local



Zuniga, et al.           Expires March 15, 2013                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft  Multicast Mobility Routing Optimizations  September 2012


   subscription to remote subscription or vice versa.  The possibility
   of switching to a source-based tree, and the time for doing so is
   implementation-dependent, and this could be triggered immediately
   (e.g. after reception of the first multicast packet) or after some
   time, or may not even switch at all.

6.3.  Source Specific Multicast Scenario

   This situation applies for PIM-SSM.  Then, in a source-specific
   multicast scenario [RFC4607], the MAG would send the PIM request to
   the corresponding interface based on the multicast source address
   indicated on the (S,G) subscription requested by the MN in the MLD
   Report, using the routing information.


7.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.


8.  Security Considerations

   This draft discusses the operations of existing protocols without
   modifications.  It does not introduce new security threats beyond the
   current security considerations of PMIPv6 [RFC5213], MLD [RFC3810],
   IGMP [RFC3376] and IGMP/MLD Proxying [RFC4605].

Appendix A.  MTMA Deployment Use Cases

   From the network architecture point of view, there are several
   options when considering the multicast tree mobility anchor (MTMA)
   approach.  These options can be distinguished in terms of the number
   of LMAs and MTMAs present in a PMIPv6 domain and the service
   relationship that a set of MNs gets from them, in the form of a "LMA
   : MTMA" ratio.  According to that, it is possible to differentiate
   the following approaches:

      A set of MNs is served in a PMIPv6 domain by two entities, one
      MTMA for multicast service, and one LMA for unicast, in such a way
      that the ratio is 1:1 (one common PMIPv6 unicast and multicast
      domain).

      A set of MNs is served in a PMIPv6 domain by several entities, one
      MTMA for multicast service, while the others (LMAs) for unicast,
      in such a way that the ratio is N:1 (N PMIPv6 unicast domains
      coexist with a unique multicast domain).

      A set of MNs is served in a PMIPv6 domain by several entities, one
      LMA for unicast, while the others (MTMAs) are devoted to multicast
      service, in such a way that the ratio is 1:N (one single PMIPv6
      unicast domain coexists with multiple multicast domains).

   Scenarios with an N:M ratio are considered to be a combination of the
   previous ones.

A.1.  PMIPv6 domain with ratio 1:1

   This approach basically refers to the architecture presented in
   Figure 1.  Within this approach, a common set of MNs is served by a
   couple of entities, one LMA for unicast and one MTMA for multicast.
   All the MNs of the set are served by these two elements as they move
   in the PMIPv6 domain.

A.2.  PMIPv6 domain with ratio N:1

   This approach basically refers to the situation where a common set of
   MNs is served by a unique MTMA for multicast service, but



Zuniga, et al.           Expires March 15, 2013                [Page 22]

Internet-Draft  Multicast Mobility Routing Optimizations  September 2012


   simultaneously there are subsets from that group of MNs which are
   served by distinct LMAs for unicast service as they move in the
   PMIPv6 domain.  Each particular MN association with the LMAs
   (unicast) and MTMA (multicast) remains always the same as it moves in
   the PMIPv6 domain.

   Figure 7 shows the scenario here described.

                  Figure 7: PMIPv6 domain with ratio N:1

   The Figure 7 proposes an architecture where there are two entities
   acting as LMAs, LMA1 and LMA3, while there is another one, named
   MTMA2, working as multicast tree mobility anchor.  LMA1 and LMA3



Zuniga, et al.           Expires March 15, 2013                [Page 23]

Internet-Draft  Multicast Mobility Routing Optimizations  September 2012


   constitute two distinct unicast domains, whereas MTMA2 forms a single
   multicast domain.  The tunnels among MAGs and LMAs represented by
   lines ("||") indicate a tunnel transporting unicast traffic, while
   the tunnels among MAGs and MTMA2 depicted with circles ("o") show a
   tunnel transporting multicast traffic.

   In the figure it can be observed that all the MNs are served by MTMA2
   for the incoming multicast traffic from sources A or B. However,
   there are different subsets regarding unicast traffic which maintain
   distinct associations within the PMIPv6 domain.  For instance, the
   subset formed by MN10, MN11, MN20 and MN21 is served by LMA1 for
   unicast, and the rest of MNs are being served by LMA3.  For the
   scenario described above, the association between each MN and the
   corresponding LMA and MTMA is permanently maintained.

A.3.  PMIPv6 domain with ratio 1:N

   This approach is related to a scenario where a common group of MNs is
   served by a unique LMA for unicast service, but simultaneously there
   are subsets from that group of MNs which are served by distinct MTMAs
   for multicast service as they move in the PMIPv6 domain.  Each
   particular MN association with the LMA and MTMAs (unicast and
   multicast respectively) remains always the same as it moves in the
   PMIPv6 domain.

   Figure 8 shows the scenario here described.

                  Figure 8: PMIPv6 domain with ratio 1:N

   The Figure 8 proposes an architecture where the LMA2 is the unique
   LMA for a certain group of MNs, while there are two others entities,
   MTMA1 and MTMA3, acting as MTMAs for different subsets of MNs of the
   same group.  MTMA1 and MTMA3 constitute two distinct multicast
   domains, whereas LMA2 forms a single unicast domain.  Each MTMA could
   be devoted to carry on a different content (for instance, MTMA1 for
   source A and MTMA3 for source B) or not.  Looking at the picture, the
   subset formed by MN10, MN11, MN20 and MN21 is served by MTMA1 for
   multicast.  The rest of MNs are being served by MTMA3 also for
   multicast.  Finally, all of them are served by LMA2 for unicast.  For
   the scenario described above, the association between each MN and the

   corresponding LMA and MTMA is permanently maintained.

A.4.  PMIPv6 domain with H-LMA

   The H-LMA is defined as an entity which simultaneously transports
   unicast and multicast service, that is, it simultaneously works as
   LMA and MTMA.  In the context of the MTMA solution, an H-LMA can play
   the role of MTMA for an entire group of MNs in a PMIPv6 domain, while
   acting simultaneously as LMA for a subset of them.  The figure 9
   adapts the PMIPv6 domain with ratio N:1 scenario of figure 7 to the
   case where MTMA2 is an H-LMA, which serves multicast traffic to all
   the MNs in the picture, and simultaneously, it is able to serve
   unicast traffic to the subset formed by MN30, MN40 and MN41.

                    Figure 9: PMIPv6 domain with H-LMA

   Figure 8 presents a PMIPv6 network where there are two pure unicast
   LMAs, LMA1 and LMA3, and a hybrid LMA, labeled as H-LMA in the
   figure.  The H-LMA is an MTMA from the perspective of MAG1 and MAG4.
   The tunnels among MAGs and LMAs represented by lines ("||") indicate
   a tunnel transporting exclusively unicast traffic, the tunnels
   depicted with circles ("o") show a tunnel transporting exclusively
   multicast traffic, and the tunnels with mixed lines and circles
   ("db") describe a tunnel transporting both types of traffic
   simultaneously.

   All of the MNs in the figure receive the multicast traffic from H-LMA
   (one single multicast domain), but it is possible to distinguish
   three subsets from the unicast service perspective (that is, three
   unicast domains).  The first subset is the one formed by MN10, MN11
   and MN 20, which receives unicast traffic from LMA1.  A second subset
   is the one formed by MN21 and MN30, which receives unicast traffic
   from H-LMA.  And finally, a third subset is built on MN31, MN40 and
   MN41, which receives unicast traffic from LMA3.  For the scenario
   described above, the association between each MN and the
   corresponding LMA and H-LMA is permanently maintained.
