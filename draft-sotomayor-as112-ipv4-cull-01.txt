Internet-Draft    Additional IPv4 Delegations for AS112        July 2011


1.  Introduction

   This is a direction to IANA concerning the delegation of certain
   additional IPv4 zones to the AS112 Project [RFC6304] which operates
   in an anycast cloud [RFC4786].


2.  Reverse DNS Delegation, Local-Use and Test Addresses

   Work documenting special use addresses [RFC5735] have appeared
   containing good candidates for inclusion with the existing
   delegations to the AS112 Project.  These local and special use
   addresses have now been captured and identified for Domain Name
   System (DNS [RFC1034] and [RFC1035]) zone administrators to curtail
   leaking queries in [RFC6303].

   Additionally, [RFC5737] identifies a short listing of IPv4 address
   blocks for use in documentation.  These too should be considered for
   delegation to the AS112 Project.

   Thus the purpose of this memo is to effectively signal to the AS112
   Project [RFC6304] that it should reflect the efforts of [RFC6303] and
   follow directives and delegations subsequently issued as described in
   section 6.

   It is interesting to note that while the focus has largely been on
   the use of [RFC1918] addresses, some addresses (such as those first
   enumerated within [RFC1912]) have as of late also been the subject of
   [RFC6303] .


3.  IANA Considerations

   As per the provisions of [RFC3596], this document recommends the IAB
   to direct IANA to delegate the following IN-ADDR.ARPA reverse DNS
   zones to the AS112 project [RFC6304]:

                 0.in-addr.arpa (IPv4 "This" Network)
               127.in-addr.arpa (IPv4 Loop-Back Network)
           2.0.192.in-addr.arpa (IPv4 Test Net 1)
        100.51.198.in-addr.arpa (IPv4 Test Net 2)
         113.0.203.in-addr.arpa (IPv4 Test Net 3)
   255.255.255.255.in-addr.arpa (IPv4 Broadcast)

   AS112 project servers should add these zones to their configuration,
   and terminate queries efficiently inside their service
   infrastructure.

   This delegation instruction is subject to further direction in the
   future from the IAB to IANA, as per the provisions of [RFC3596].


4.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations described in [RFC6304] also apply to
   local-use IPv4 addresses, and should be considered in the context of
   the use of these addresses.

   Security administrators as well as general support personnel who are
   involved in the operations of networked devices may also find the
   information found in the companion document [RFC6305] quite helpful.

   DNS queries may well identify the location of deployment of IPv4
   enabled equipment in private contexts, particularly when the reverse
   queries relate to local-use IPv4 addresses.  While operators of the
   DNS reverse servers should respect the privacy of data relating to
   individual queries made to these reverse address servers, the
   unintentional leakage of information beyond its intended scope of use
   and circulation represents a potential threat to the security of a
   local private network.  This direction to delegate these local-use
   IPv4 reverse address sub-domains does not substantially change the
   security risks of information leakage from private environments.


5.  Acknowledgements

   The author would like to acknowledge the efforts of Mark P. Andrews
   for preparing the work related to serving certain DNS zones locally
   and George Michaelson and Geoff Huston for their work
   [I-D.michaelson-as112-ipv6] in setting the example for a template to
   be used by the AS112 Project as a direction for the IANA.

   The author would also like to thank Joe Abley, Marco d'Itri, Nick
   Hilliard and Paul Vixie for their feedback.
