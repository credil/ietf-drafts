1.  Introduction

   Various transition tools have been proposed and well optimized.  The
   ISP should select most suitable tools to meet the requirements of a
   mainstream broadband access network in the real world regarding its
   network architecture, operation situation and transition goals, etc.

   To satisfy the typical broadband access network, which provides
   subscribers internet service through PPPOE via L2 access network,
   this draft filters numbers of transition technologies basing on
   specific principles.  Then, a detailed comparison is made between
   native dual-stack and tunnels, represented by NAT444 and DS-lite
   respectively.  It is concluded that native dual-stack is more
   appropriate than tunnels for this specific network.  At last, this
   draft points out some problems that NAT444 are not designed to solve
   during each period of transition and refers to a more systematic and
   operational proposal.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Terminologies

   To be continued.


4.  Brief Description of ISP's Broadband Network

   At the present stage, there are two major service models: PPPoE and
   IPoE for operators to provide broadband access service to the
   subscriber.  In some scenes, PPPoE offers better security and control
   functions for the home user than IPoE, and relatively more suitable
   for broadband service.  But IPoE is more appropriate for multicast
   services.  For broadband access network, it's reasonable to believe
   that PPPoE is much more popular than the other one.  So, it is urgent
   to do some research on this typical broadband access model.

   Broadband access network which uses PPPoE technology also has
   following characteristics:

   o  L2 access network;





Yang, et al.            Expires January 12, 2012                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft            FAST6-tools selection                July 2011


   o  Bridged mode or routed mode CPE are both permitted for users;

   o  Large number of existing users, it grows rapidly and IPv4 address
      depletion has a direct impact on services;

   o  Due to large network, there is enormous number of network devices
      and part of them cannot support IPv6 in the future.  Although this
      kind of equipment will be replaced partially , this situation will
      last for a long period.  That means in current network, there will
      be a number of equipments that are unable to be updated to support
      IPv6.

   The new ISP can achieve the goal in one leap through building a new
   network.  However, for some old brand ISPs with heavy load on
   transition for their large number of subscribers and diverse
   situation of the legacy devices, choosing an appropriate transition
   strategy is a key point for development, and has a great impact in
   the future.

   The major driver of IPv6 transition is from the address shortage, so
   the ISPs with high speed development in business are the only parties
   that urgent to transition in order to satisfied the increasing IP
   address demand from new subscribers.This paper focus on this parties,
   the totally new network and services, or the network with high
   saturation will not be discussed.


5.  Transition Principles

   The ISP requirement for IPv6 transition is depend on ISP's role.  As
   a company, making profit is the most important goal of ISP.
   Therefore, for example, when the network is transiting to IPv6, a
   more mature and stable technology is more applicable to be chosen
   than a newer, more creative and greener one.  ISP is also different
   from equipment manufacturers for they pursuit a balance between user
   experience and investment.  For instance, when make an IPv6
   transition route, a conservative one maybe more popular than an
   aggressive one.

   From the perspective of an ISP, principles of network migration are
   concluded as follows:

   o  Ensure user experience.;

   o  Save cost;

   o  Reduce technical risks;

   o  Convenient operation and maintenance;

   o  Security supervision.


6.  Technologies Selection

   Now there are two solutions for IPv4 address depletion: using private
   IPv4 (RFC1918) and IPv6.  For private IPv4, there are two transition
   technologies: A+P and NAT.  For IPv6, there are two types of
   transition mechanisms, the first type is dual-stack, including 6RD,
   NAT444, DS-LITE, etc., and the second type is native IPv6, including
   PNAT, 1:N IVI, NAT64, etc,.

   This chapter would describe the transitional problems related to the
   existing transitional technologies, under the principles of technical
   choice, and considering the current situation of broadband access
   network.

6.1.  Goal Consistency

   In the short term, to permit the network to continue to grow, a
   series of tools are developed.  These tools include more efficient
   use of the IPv4 address resource, conservation, and the sharing of
   IPv4 addresses through the use of NAT.  While these provide partial
   mitigation for IPv4 exhaustion, they are not a long-term solution,
   increase network costs, and merely postpone some of the consequences
   of address exhaustion without solving the underlying problem.  Some
   of these fixes break end-to-end connectivity, impairing innovation
   and hampering applications, degrading network performance, and
   resulting in an inferior version of the Internet.  Network operators
   will be confronted with increased costs to offer potentially inferior
   service.

   The short term solution is problematic.  The "solution to the
   solution" is to complete the transition to the native IPv6 network.
   So, using NAT and A+P can obstruct the development of IPv6, and it's
   inconsistent with the goal of the Next Generation Internet.

6.2.  Application Continuity

   The mainstream Operation Systems, for example Windows XP, Windows 7
   and Linux support IPv6, but when the application is establishing the
   connection, it will call the socket in the lower layer.  If the
   application designed without the consideration of IPv6, there will be
   some problems when the application is calling socket.  Currently,
   most of the Internet applications are not supported IPv6 except some
   business software developed by large firms.  According to the



Yang, et al.            Expires January 12, 2012                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            FAST6-tools selection                July 2011


   Internet statistics of China, there are around 50% of applications do
   not support IPv6, mainly various P2P applications and Instant Message
   applications.  When users are accessing Internet with IPv6 only,
   nearly 50% of Internet traffic will be disappeared.  Therefore, the
   IPv6 only solutions like NAT64 and IVI will not be the main role
   during the network migration.  However, in some scenarios, for
   example IPTV, IPv6 only solution is a good pathway, because the users
   and services are simple in this kind of scenario.

6.3.  User Habit

   Some transition technologies will introduce specific plug-in
   installed in users!_ hosts to avoid changes in network
   infrastructure, but it results the maintenance boundary changed from
   network access point to users!_ hosts.  When there is a failure, it
   may be related to users!_ hardware, operation system, applications,
   SP!_s network and host plug-ins.  In this situation, the
   responsibility is hard to defined, which leads the rapid increasing
   of maintenance cost.  Meanwhile, as privacy issue, users are careful
   or even decline, to install such kind of plug-in.  Therefore, service
   providers must carefully consider when they choose the solutions with
   plug-in, which means PNAT or host-based DS-Lite is not a main tool
   during the transition period.

6.4.  Network Scalability

   With the continually increasing number of subscribers, the network
   scale will correspondingly expand. 6RD cannot meet the requirements
   of the network when their trends are native IPv6 or dual-stack, since
   it is only applicable in native IPv4 network.

   In summary, considering the fitness of the long term goal of
   Internet, the continuity of applications, end user application habits
   and network scalability, and according to this specific broadband
   network scenario, the native IPv4, native IPv6 and part of the dual-
   stack transition skills are not proper to be deployed.  It seems like
   that NAT444 and DS-lite are more applicable to choose.


7.  DS-lite & NAT444

   Both DS-lite and NAT444 are belonging to dual-stack tools and they
   are different in technology maturity, equipment maturity and
   applicable scenarios.  NAT444 is composed of mature tools while DS-
   lite is a green technology and has a long way to be a standard.  In
   addition, NAT has existed for many years in firewall while DS-lite is
   only on its way of trial with no large-scale commercial deployment
   cases.  NAT444 and DS-lite are the same in consuming IPv4 address



Yang, et al.            Expires January 12, 2012                [Page 6]

   number, and they are all supported by current mainstream Internet
   applications.

   Which is more suitable for this typical broadband network?  The
   detailed analysis is as below:

7.1.  Deployment differences

   The difficulties of switchover and deployment for NAT444 and DS-LITE
   are basically the same.  However, NAT444 is much more flexible in
   deployment for it can be allocated either in distributed way or
   centralized way.  In comparison, DS-lite prefers centralized
   deployment because the distributed way is meaningless for the
   specific scenario.  The reason is that if AFTR is distributed besides
   the BNG, there is no native IPv6 network for DS-lite to show its
   advantages, since in this typical broadband network scenario, the
   access network is composed of L2 equipments which are unaware of
   IPv6.  In addition, at present, the native IPv6 network has not been
   tested for a long time enough, there is a considerably high risk for
   the operators to carry the most important service traffic over it.

   In conclusion, in the initial period of transition, it is not proper
   to use DS-lite for the large quantity of IPv4 traffic.

7.2.  CPE diversity

   Currently, most CPEs are in bridged-mode and they have already
   supported NAT444.  The newly developed CPEs are baring dual-stack and
   consequently support NAT444.  When the legacy CPE are used to deploy
   NAT444, the running IPv4 services will not be impacted.

   However, if the CPE is transformed to support DS-lite, despite the
   NAT444 function, the tunnel function should also be incorporated.
   The CPEs cannot access the current IPv4 services if they are not
   replaced with an updated one when DS-lite is deployed.

   In conclusion, NAT444 can not only continue the existing terminal
   strategies but also keep the existing service model unchanged when
   using routed or bridged CPE to support PPPOE accessing.  In contrast,
   DS-lite cannot easily be socialized for its customized routed-model
   CPE.

7.3.  Cost Difference

   Considering the network cost aspect, NAT444 has very little
   difference from DS-lite.

   From the perspective of terminal, DS-lite costs slightly higher than



Yang, et al.            Expires January 12, 2012                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            FAST6-tools selection                July 2011


   NAT444GBP"because it should support DS-lite despite of dual-stack
   GBP(C)for the new subscribers.  For the legacy ones, if they use
   NAT444, they have no need to replace the bridged-mode CPE and the
   routed-mode CPE only need to support IPv6.  It is very easy for
   NAT444 to socialize and lower the operation cost.  In contrast, the
   DS-lite technology is not mature,it will impact existing IPv4 service
   once they are running abnormally and consequently cause the lost of
   customers.  DS-lite has larger risk in cost.

   In terms of operation, NAT444 can follow the traditional operation
   method with low cost while DS-lite has high risk on cost for changing
   the original operation way.

7.4.  O&M Diversity

   From trouble shooting aspect, NAT444 can easily locate the errors
   happen in IPv4 and IPv6 separately.  In contrast, it is difficult to
   detect the troubles of IPv4 since IPv4 is encapsulated in IPv6 tunnel
   in DS-lite.

   In terms of reliability, logically speaking, IPv6 and IPv4 are ships
   in the night and IPv6 error won't influence the stability of IPv4
   directly in NAT444.  Otherwise, the troubles happened in IPv6 will
   affect the IPv4 running in DS-lite.

   As for the aspect of forwarding efficiency, enabling IPv6 has little
   influence in NAT444.  However, in DS-lite, all this traffic must be
   tunneled,encapsulated and decapsulated, so it will cut down the
   forwarding efficiency.

   Considering from the operational staff training aspect, it is not
   very difficult to train the NAT skilled staff to operate NAT444 and
   people have enough time to be familiar with NAT444.  In contrast, the
   training on DS-lite should be finished before the deployment.  The
   time is too short for the people to be fully trained.

7.5.  Supporting system Differences

   In the term of DNS, NAT444 and DS-lite are almost the same.
   Considering the accounting, the workload of NAT444 is twice as the
   DS-lite and the accounting logic is much more complicated than DS-
   lite.  Both of them ask for much higher performance requirement for
   NAT444 DNS.  But basically they have the same customer management and
   tracing system which need to trace IPv6 and IPv4 separately and to
   save the record of address translation respectively.

   Since NAT444 and DS-lite have different requirements for support
   system, it is not proper to deploy both of these two transition tools



Yang, et al.            Expires January 12, 2012                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft            FAST6-tools selection                July 2011


   in the same time and in the same region.

   The comparisons of NAT444 and Ds-lite are summarized as follows:

   Regarding the impact on customers, both of them can support IPv4
   Internet application and have tiny influences to the user' IPv4
   application.

   From the point of cost controlling, the DS-lite costs a little higher
   than NAT444 for a single terminal.  However, when DS-lite is deployed
   in large-scale, the cost of terminals will be highly raised.

   Speaking of technique risk, the NAT444 is much mature than DS-lite
   and won't impact the IPv4 service.  DS-lite is a new tool for
   transition and its future trend is not very clear, so operator will
   take higher risk in the early stage of transition.  Meanwhile, using
   tunnel makes DS-lite increase the difficulties of operation and
   maintenance, leading performance bottleneck in the initial period
   which will decline the network performance and customer experience
   and correspondingly heighten the deployment risk.

   Technically speaking, NAT444 and DS-LITE are no matter which is
   better and which is worse, they are simply different from the period
   of deploying, network scenarios and service model.  And because of
   the different requirements for network, support system and terminals,
   it is not recommended to use both of these two transition tools in
   the same time and the same region.

   As we analyzed in the above paragraph, NAT444 is more suitable to be
   used in the whole transition period while DS-lite is proper for the
   latter period of transition with small number of IPv4 subscribers.


8.  Conclusion

   For the mainstream ISP, native dual stack is more appropriate
   compared to dual stack tunnel.  Although NAT444 makes a balance
   between guaranteeing the customer experience and promoting the
   development of IPv6.  However, it is not a comprehensive solution for
   broadband network.  For example, how to provide the IPv6 service to
   legacy subscribers, if their default network gateway (BNG) cannot be
   upgraded to support IPv6 and consequently unable to allocate IPv6
   address to the customers, is not mentioned in NAT444.  In addition,
   the emergence of mixed routes (private and public IPv4 route) may
   bring operators great difficulties to manage the routes, how to solve
   this problem is not taken account in NAT444.  Above there are just
   two exampled problems that NAT444 doesn't design to solve.  In
   conclusion, as a transition technology, NAT444 has the weakness of

   one-sided consideration about the transition scenarios and doesn't
   give a complete solution for each period of IPv6 migration.  To meet
   the ISP's requirement, which needs a more systematic and operational
   technologies, FAST6, a comprehensive solution based on native dual-
   stack is proposed and its detail is described in
   I.D:draft-yang-v6ops-fast6-pppoe.
