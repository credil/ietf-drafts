    Abstract 

       In this document, followed by the idea mentioned in [1] and 
       subsequently  updated  in  [2],  an  IGMP/MLD  proxy  with  multiple 
       upstream interfaces called MUIIMP is proposed and analyzed. The 
       MUIIMP inherits the basic rule of the IGMP/MLD proxy but extends 
       with multiple upstream interfaces. To avoid data redundancy, each 
       upstream interface of an MUIIMP device MUST NOT send or subscribe to 
       the same data simultaneously.

    Internet-Draft  Multi-Upstream Interfaces IGMP/MLD Proxy      July 2013 
     

      1. Introduction 

       RFC 4605 [3] specifies an IGMP/MLD proxy mechanism for forwarding 
       based solely upon IGMP/MLD membership information in scenarios where 
       multicast routing is not available. According to RFC 4605, an 
       IGMP/MLD proxy performs the router portion of the IGMP/MLD protocol 
       [4-5] on its downstream interfaces, and the host portion of the 
       IGMP/MLD protocol on its single upstream interface.  

       The IGMP/MLD proxy mechanism can effectively extend the multicast 
       scope and greatly simplify the implementation of edge devices. 
       However,  the  IGMP/MLD  proxy  may  exhibit  inefficiency  in  some 
       specific  scenarios  due  to  the  limitation  of  single  upstream 
       interface. For example, in PMIPv6 multicast environment, multiple 
       IGMP/MLD proxy instances need to be deployed at the MAG in RFC 6224 
       [6], which may result in tunnel convergence problem. In addition, 
       there are also requirements to extend the IGMP/MLD proxy to support 
       multiple upstream interfaces with the emergence of multi-homing.  

       It is noted that the idea about multiple upstream interfaces for 
       IGMP/MLD proxy was firstly proposed in the draft [1] to improve the 
       performance of multicast source mobility. Subsequently, the Multimob 
       working group draft [2] describes the multi-upstream interfaces 
       IGMP/MLD  proxy  in  detail.  Considering  the  multiple  upstream 
       interfaces extension is not only required for mobile multicast 
       sources scenarios, this document is presented here.  

       In  this  document,  an  IGMP/MLD  proxy  with  multiple  upstream 
       interfaces called MUIIMP is proposed and described. The MUIIMP 
       inherits the basic rule of the IGMP/MLD proxy but extends with 
       multiple  upstream  interfaces.  To  avoid  data  redundancy,  each 
       upstream interfaces of an MUIIMP device MUST NOT send or subscribe 
       to  the  same  data  simultaneously.  Additionally,  the  MUIIMP  is 
       designed to support local multicast listeners and senders.  

      2. Terminology 

       Upstream Interface: A proxy device's interface in the direction of 
       the root of the tree. 

      Downstream Interface: Each of a proxy device's interfaces that is not 
      in the direction of the root of the multicast tree.   

       Default upstream interface: An upstream interface which is by 
       default associated with each downstream node subscribing or sending 
       specific channel (group address prefix) or special multicast state.

      3. MUIIMP Operation 

       The MUIIMP inherits the basic rule of the IGMP/MLD proxy but extends 
       with multiple upstream interfaces. A MUIIMP device has one or more 
       upstream as well as downstream interfaces, which may be any type 
       interfaces, including physical or logical interfaces.  

       The MUIIMP performs the router portion of the IGMP/MLD protocol on 
       its downstream interfaces, and the host portion of IGMP/MLD on its 
       upstream interfaces. The MUIIMP device MUST NOT perform the router 
       portion of IGMP/MLD on its upstream interfaces. 

       The MUIIMP device maintains a database for multicast listeners 
       consisting of the merger of all subscriptions on any downstream 
       interface. In order to avoid the redundant multicast traffic, the 
       proxy device should initiate unique traffic subscriptions. Besides, 
       a policy list that records the default upstream interface for the 
       downstream nodes is held for the selection of upstream interface. 

       According to the role of the downstream nodes, the operation of the 
       MUIIMP device will be described as follows: 

       1) Multicast listener on the downstream interface 

       Multicast listener reports are group-wise aggregated by the IGMP/MLD 
       proxy. The aggregated report is issued to the upstream interface 
       based on the subscriptions as well as the policy list. When 
       receiving the IGMP/MLD subscriptions on the downstream interface, 
       the MUIIMP decides whether to send the IGMP/MLD membership reports 
       on  the  corresponding  default  upstream  interface  based  on  the 
       membership database. The detailed membership subscriptions lookup 
       and report decisions are discussed in Section 3.2.  

       When receiving packets on its upstream interfaces, the MUIIMP 
       forwards the traffic to all the downstream interfaces based upon the 
       downstream interfaces' subscriptions. 

       2) Multicast source on the downstream interface 

       When receiving packets on its downstream interface, the MUIIMP 
       forwards the traffic to the corresponding default upstream interface 
       as well as all the downstream interfaces other than the incoming 
       interface based upon the downstream interfaces' subscriptions. 

       The (first) multicast router(s) operating multicast routing protocol 
       like PIM-SM [7] connected to the outside multicast domain should be 
       configured to treat the multicast source inside the MUIIMP domain 
     
     
    Zhang et al.            Expires January, 2014                 [Page 4] 
        
    Internet-Draft  Multi-Upstream Interfaces IGMP/MLD Proxy      July 2013 
     

       being directly connected. Otherwise, it will discard the data due to 
       the failure of the direct connection check. 

       3.1. The selection of default upstream interface 

       Typically, the choice of the default upstream interface is based on 
       the policy list which is maintained at the MUIIMP.  

       The expression of the policy list is like below: 

       (node prefix, multicast group address/multicast state, upstream 
       interface) 

       Here, node prefix represents the address prefix of the node on the 
       downstream interface that may be a multicast listener or multicast 
       source. The multicast group address indicates the channel that the 
       multicast  listener  is  subscribing  or  the  multicast  source  is 
       publishing, while the multicast state is only valid for listeners 
       indicating the state about both multicast source and multicast group 
       they are subscribing.   

       In other word, in the MUIIMP, the multicast group address/multicast 
       state and the node prefix will act as rules to select the default 
       upstream interface. Alternate configurations (e.g., the MAG-LMA 
       tunnel interface in the PMIPv6 environment) MAY be applied. 

       3.2. Report of downstream subscriptions on upstream interfaces 

       To avoid the redundant multicast traffic, the proxy device MUST NOT 
       send the same multicast subscription record on different upstream 
       interfaces simultaneously. In detail, we recommend the following 
       rules when receiving an IGMP/MLD subscription on the downstream 
       interface. 

       1) If the received IGMP/MLD subscription is new and has not been 
          subscribed by other downstream multicast listeners, the proxy 
          device  SHOULD  initiate  the  IGMP/MLD  subscription  on  the 
          corresponding default upstream interface.  

       2) If there exists the same IGMP/MLD subscription which has already 
          been subscribed by other downstream multicast listeners, the proxy 
          device SHOULD not initiate extra IGMP/MLD subscription. 

       3) If  there  exists  IGMP/MLD  subscriptions  which  have  already 
          included the received IGMP/MLD subscription, the proxy device 
          SHOULD not initiate extra IGMP/MLD subscription.

    Internet-Draft  Multi-Upstream Interfaces IGMP/MLD Proxy      July 2013 
     

       4) If there exists overlapping subsets between the received IGMP/MLD 
          subscription and the current IGMP/MLD subscriptions, the proxy 
          device  SHOULD  initiate  the  IGMP/MLD  subscription  on  the 
          corresponding default upstream interface excluding the overlapping 
          subsets that have been subscribed before. 

       All subscriptions sent on the same upstream interface SHOULD be 
       merged according to the merging rule specified in RFC 4605. In 
       addition, the local multicast source should be excluded in the final 
       subscriptions to avoid replicated multicast traffic from outside.  

       3.3. Handover of the upstream interface  

       If an upstream interface fails for some reason, such as the deletion 
       of the tunnel interface in mobile environment, the handover of the 
       upstream  interface  should  be  performed.  Generally,  all  the 
       subscriptions sent on the previous invalid upstream interface are 
       transferred to the new valid upstream interfaces which are chosen 
       among  the  default  upstream  interfaces  of  the  corresponding 
       downstream nodes. The choice may be made based on the predefined 
       policy (e.g., the interface priority, the number of listeners, the 
       lowest IP address). An alternative may be applied by the MUIIMP 
       device itself according to the traffic monitored or some strategies 
       configured by the operator. 

      4. Use Case in PMIPv6 Environment  

       With the development of the Mobile IP-like protocols (such as, MIPv6, 
       PMIPv6 and DMM), combining multicast with mobile protocols has been 
       widely discussed. One way is to deploy traditional IGMP/MLD proxy at 
       the gateway of mobile nodes [2,6], but there are some drawbacks like 
       the detour routing and tunnel convergence problem. MUIIMP can be 
       used to optimize the behavior of multicast mobility as well as to 
       support the multi-homing/multi-interface for both the mobile nodes 
       and the fixed nodes. Requirements for an IGMP/MLD proxy with 
       multiple interfaces have been proposed in the draft [8], covering a 
       variety of application scenarios. In this section, a use-case in 
       PMIPv6 environment is presented to illustrate how the MUIIMP works.  

       The basic deployment of MUIIMP in PIMPv6 networks is shown in Figure 
       1, in which there are three mobile nodes (MNs) belonging to 
       different LMAs and attaching under the same MAG. Let's adopt the 
       scheme in RFC 6224 [6] and assume that the default upstream 
       interface for each MN in Figure 1 is the tunnel interface from the 
       MAG to the corresponding LMA. In real environment, the MN may also 
       express its preference on upstream interface selection by other 
       means. Detailed multicast related information of each MN is depicted

       in Table 1. We assume that MN1, MN2 and MN3 attach at the MAG in 
       sequence.

       The operation of the MUIIMP is described as follows: 

       1) MN1  firstly  subscribes  (m1,EXCLUDE,{}),  (m2,EXCLUDE,{})  and 
          (m3,INCLUDE,{a}), the MUIIMP initiates the corresponding IGMP/MLD 
          subscription through the IF-A.

    Internet-Draft  Multi-Upstream Interfaces IGMP/MLD Proxy      July 2013 
     

       2) When MN2 (as well as MN3) subscribes (m1,EXCLUDE,{}), since there 
          exists the same IGMP/MLD subscription through the IF-A, the MUIIMP 
          will not initiate extra IGMP/MLD subscription. 

       3) When MN2 subscribes (m2,INCLUDE,{b}), since (m2,EXCLUDE,{}) has 
          been subscribed, the MUIIMP does not initiate extra IGMP/MLD 
          subscription.  

       4) When MN2 subscribes (m3,EXCLUDE,{}), since (m3,INCLUDE,{a}) has 
          been subscribed through the IF-A, the MUIIMP will send IGMP/MLD 
          subscription of (m3,EXCLUDE,{a}) through the IF-B. 

       5) When MN3 acts one of the sources for m2, traffic from MN3 are 
          transmitted to the downstream interface towards MN1 as well as the 
          IF-C. Besides, IGMP/MLD subscription of (m2,EXCLUDE,{}) sent by 
          the MUIIMP through the IF-A is modified as (m2,EXCLUDE,{MN3}). 

       6) When MN1 hands over, the tunnel interface IF-A will be deleted 
          and the MUIIMP needs to deal with this scenario because the 
          subscriptions of MN2 and MN3 was sent through the IF-A previously. 
          Here, IF-B and IF-C, as the default upstream interfaces of MN2 and 
          MN3, are two candidate upstream interfaces for m1 subscription.  
          Then, the predefined customized policy can be used to select a new 
          U-IF   from   the   candidate   upstream   interfaces.   As   for 
          (m2,INCLUDE,{b}) and (m3,EXCLUDE,{}), they are only subscribed by 
          the MN2, thus, the IF-B will be selected as the new U-IF for them.    

       It is worth noting that the fixed node (FN) connecting to the MAG can 
       be regarded as an MN that never handovers. The default upstream 
       interface of FN can be an interface adjacent to multicast domain, 
       like the IF-D in Figure 1.
