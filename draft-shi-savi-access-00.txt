        SAVI Requirements and Solutions for ISP IPv6 Access Network

Abstract

   The Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) was developed to
   prevent IP source address spoofing which can enable impersonation and
   malicious traffic redirection. An Internet Service Provider (ISP) who
   provides Internet access services, information services and value-
   added services to the customers should guarantee security of its
   network and customers' privacy. Thus, the mechanism is essential for
   ISPs. However, due to a diversity of ISPs' access network, SAVI
   solution is also different accordingly. This document describes five
   scenarios of ISPs'IPv6 access network, and moreover, states its SAVI
   requirements and according tentative solutions.

1. Introduction

   Spoofing of IP source addresses can jeopardize people's privacy,
   enable malicious traffic redirection which causes the network
   topology and traffic information to be leaked out. Further, it will
   be difficult to trace the source host which forged the packet. The
   Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) method was designed to

   prevent hosts attached to the same link from spoofing each other's IP
   address. It is developed to complement ingress filtering with finer-
   grained with standardized IP source address validation. It is also
   can be deployed easily in networks due to its modularization and
   extensibility.

   ISPs have an imperative demand to apply the SAVI mechanism in order
   to ensure the network's security. Internet Service Provider has
   multiple access scenarios not limited to Ethernet, usually deployed
   with DHCP. Other scenarios such as ADSL with PPP, Ethernet with PPP
   are also popular in the real word. Unfortunately, SAVI Switch only
   works in the scenarios of wire or wireless Ethernet and not support
   all address assignment methods that be used in access network. There
   are four address assigned methods identified in one of the SAVI
   document:

   1. Stateless Address Auto Configuration (SLACC) [I-D.ietf-savi-fcfs]

   2. Dynamic Host Control Protocol address assignment (DHCP)
      [I-D.ietf-savi-dhcp]

   3. Secure Neighbor Discovery (SeND) address assignment
      [I-D.ietf-savi-send]

   4. Mix Address assignment methods
      [I-D.ietf-savi-mix]

   Thus, According to different access network scenarios, SAVI should
   adjust its deployment and may need to promote and make improvement to
   adapt with the real situation. This note analyzes five scenarios of
   ISPs' IPv6 access network, and on this basis, gives according
   tentative SAVI solutions.

3. Scenarios for ISPs'IPv6 Access Network

   It is important to note that the deployment of SAVI device was
   impacted greatly by access network scenarios and its address

   assignment methods. There are various access methods for ISPs'IPv6
   access network. In order to meet different IP Source Address
   Validation requirements, SAVI solutions may be need to be improved to
   adapt with the real situation.

   There are five typical scenarios of ISPs'IPv6 access network:

   1. Home gateway (HG) acts as DHCPv6 proxy.

   2. Set Top-box (STB) gets IP address via DHCPv6.

   3. Host gets IP address via PPPoE & RA.

   4. Laptop accesses Internet via WLAN.

   5. Laptop accesses Internet via C+W.

   We will discuss the SAVI solution for each scenario in detail in the
   next section.

3.1. Scenario 1: Home gateway (HG) acts as DHCPv6 proxy

   Figure 1 shows the main elements in scenario 1. PC and STB connect to
   the Internet via HG. Its address assignment mechanism can be
   described as the following steps: First of all, HG gets a link-local
   IPv6-IPv6 address from BRAS via PPPoE and ND/RA. Then, HG gets IPv6
   address from BRAS via DHCPv6-PD. At last, PC and STB get IPv6 address

   from HG via DHCPv6. Of course, PC and STB can also get IPv6 address
   via ND/RA, but the DHCPv6 is much popular.

   According to SAVI mechanism, in order to achieve Source Address
   Validation, the SAVI device must snoop the whole procedure of Address
   assignment. In addition, the preferred location of SAVI instances is
   close to hosts, such as in switches that directly attach to the hosts
   where host IP addresses are being validated [I-D.ietf-savi-framework].
   So we can deploy SAVI device close to the HG in upstream direction.
   It can be illustrated by figure 2.

                  Figure 2: SAVI solution for Scenario 1


   Figure 2 shows the deployment of SAVI device. It also allows multiple
   SAVI devices and non-SAVI devices co-exist on link. In addition, for
   this solution, SAVI mechanism needs to improve to snoop the procedure
   of DHCPv6-PD so as to bind the relationship <HG/PC/STB's address,
   port, MAC>.

3.2. Scenario 2: STB gets IP address via DHCPv6

   The difference between scenario 1 and scenario 2 is the absence of HG
   which acts as DHCPv6 proxy. In scenario 2, STB which has internal

   account and password gets IPv6 prefix by DHCPv6. The general scene
   workflow include the following steps: STB send requests to all
   routers on local link by using link-local address which based on its
   MAC address. The BRAS informs STB to adopt DHCPv6 address assignment
   method as a response. STB initiates DHCPv6 procedure and BRAS acts as
   a DHCP Relay to add some authorities' messages. AAA server decides
   whether assign address parameters depend on the result of
   authentication. At last, BRAS receives IPv6 parameters from AAA
   server, and then, informs STB via DHCPv6 protocol. It can be
   illustrated by figure 3.

                            Figure 3: Scenario2


   Figure 3 shows the main elements in scenario 2. Due to pure DHCPv6
   address assignment method in this scenario, we can deploy SAVI device
   close to STB in upstream direction directly and SAVI mechanism
   needn't make any improvement. It just needs to bind relationship
   <STB's IP Address, port, STB's MAC Address> which is included in
   existing function. The solution can be illustrated by figure 4.

   The interaction in this scenario is simple relatively. The laptop
   gets IPv6 address via DHCPv6. Then, users were enforced to be
   certified by submitting password on a portal page.

3.5. Scenario 5: Laptop accesses Internet via C+W

   This scenario describes that the laptop accesses Internet via CDMA
   and WLAN. The general scene workflow include the following steps: The
   laptop gets a temporary IPv6 address from BARS via DHCPv6, and then,

   obtains the WAG address from DNS server. The laptop establishes a UDP
   tunnel to WAG by sending register request. If the tunnel established
   successfully, the laptop can get IPv6 prefix from PDSN via PPP and RA,
   whereas PDSN acts as the PPP terminal. At last, the laptop gets some
   additional information such as DNS address. When the above steps all
   accomplished, the laptop acquires the ability to access Internet.

   Figure 9 shows the main elements in scenario 5. For this scenario, we
   also can deploy SAVI device at the position close to LAPTOP. SAVI
   needs to improve to support for PPPoE protocol snooping. It also
   binds relationship <LAPTOP's IP Address, port, LAPTOP's MAC>. The
   solution was described by figure 10.

4. Conclusions

   There are various scenarios of ISPs'IPv6 Access Network. Because each
   scenario uses different address assignment method and protocol, there
   are a variety of requirements to validate source address for ISPs'
   IPv6 access network. SAVI cannot support all protocols and methods
   right now, but, due to expansibility of SAVI, the mechanism can
   satisfy these various demands with a little improvement. This
   document presents five typical scenarios of ISPs'IPv6 access network,
   and proposes tentative SAVI solutions including some improvement.
