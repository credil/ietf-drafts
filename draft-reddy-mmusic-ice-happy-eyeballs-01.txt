                draft-reddy-mmusic-ice-happy-eyeballs-01

Abstract

   This document specifies requirements for algorithms that make ICE
   connectivity checks more responsive by reducing delays in dual-stack
   host ICE connectivity checks when there is a path failure for the
   address family preferred by the application or by the operating
   system.  As IPv6 is usually preferred, the procedures in this
   document helps avoid user-noticeable delays when the IPv6 path is
   broken or excessively slow.

1.  Introduction

   In situations where there are many IPv6 addresses, ICE [RFC5245] will
   prefer IPv6 candidates [RFC6724] and will attempt connectivity checks
   on all the IPv6 candidates before trying an IPv4 candidate.  If the
   IPv6 path is broken, this fallback to IPv4 can consume a lot of time,
   harming user satisfaction of dual-stack devices.

   This document describes an algorithm that makes ICE connectivity
   checks more responsive to failures of an address family by reordering
   the candidate pairs such that IPv6 and IPv4 candidates get a fair
   chance during connectivity checks.  This document specifies
   requirements for any such algorithm, with the goals that the ICE
   agent need not be inordinately harmed with a simple reordering of the
   candidate pairs.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This note uses terminology defined in [RFC5245].

3.  Candidates Priority

   A prioritization formula is used by ICE [RFC5245] so that most
   preferred address pairs are tested first, and if a sufficiently good

   pair is discovered, the tests can be stopped.  With IPv6, addresses
   obtained from local network interfaces, called host candidates, are
   recommended as high-priority ones to be tested first since if they
   work, they provide usually the best path between the two hosts.  The
   ICE specification recommends to use the rules defined in [RFC6724] as
   part of the prioritization formula for IPv6 host candidates and
   [I-D.keranen-mmusic-ice-address-selection] updates the ICE rules on
   how IPv6 host candidates are selected.

   For dual-stack hosts the preference for IPv6 host candidates is
   higher than IPv4 host candidates based on precedence value of IP
   addresses described in [RFC6724].  IPv6 server reflexive candidates
   have higher precedence than IPv4 server reflexive candidate since
   NPTv6 is stateless and transport-agnostic.

   (highest)  IPv6 Host Candidate
              IPv4 Host Candidate
              IPv6 Server Reflexive Candidate
              IPv4 Server Reflexive Candidate
              IPv6 Relayed Transport Candidate
   (lowest)   IPv4 Relayed Transport Candidate

            Figure 1: Candidate Preferences in decreasing order

   By using the technique described in Section 4, if there are both IPv6
   and IPv4 addresses in the check list, and the first 'N' candidates
   are of the same IP address family, then the highest-priority
   candidate pair of the other address family is promoted to position N
   in the check list thus making ICE connectivity checks more responsive
   to failures of an address family.

   Note: The algorithm works even if the administrator changes the
   policy table to prefer IPv4 addresses over IPv6 addresses as defined
   in [RFC6724]

4.  Algorithm overview

   The Happy Eyeballs Extension for ICE algorithm proposes the
   following:

   1.  Indicate support for ICE Happy Eyeballs in the SDP offer if the
       end-point is dual-stack.  The end-point will also include the
       position 'N' at which promotion is to occur.

Internet-Draft           Happy Eyeballs for ICE                July 2013


   2.  After SDP offer/answer exchange if both end points support ICE
       Happy Extension for ICE algorithm the following steps are
       performed by the ICE agents after computing the candidate pair
       priority, ordering and pruning the pairs (section 5.7.2, 5.7.3 of
       [RFC5245])

       a.  If the first 'N' candidate pairs in the check list are of the
           same IP address family, then the highest-priority candidate
           pair of the other address family is promoted to position 'N'
           in the list.

       b.  Step b is repeated for candidate pairs that are next in the
           check list.  This is continued until all candidate pairs of
           the preferred address family are exhausted.

   The result of these steps is that after every consecutive 'N'
   candidate pairs of the preferred family, a candidate pair of the
   other family is inserted.

   The following figure illustrates the result of the algorithm on
   candidate pairs:

               IPv6 Server Reflexive Candidate pair
               IPv6 Relayed Transport Candidate pair
    (lowest)   IPv4 Relayed Transport Candidate pair


4.1.  Processing the Results

   If ICE connectivity checks using an IPv4 candidate is successful then
   ICE Agent will performs as usual "Discovering Peer Reflexive
   Candidates" (Section 7.1.3.2.1 of [RFC5245]), "Constructing a Valid
   Pair" (Section 7.1.3.2.2 of [RFC5245]), "Updating Pair States"
   (Section 7.1.3.2.3 of [RFC5245]), "Updating the Nominated Flag"
   (Section 7.1.3.2.4 of [RFC5245]).

   If ICE connectivity checks using an IPv4 candidate is successful for
   each component of the media stream and connectivity checks using IPv6
   candidates is not yet successful, the ICE endpoint will declare
   victory, conclude ICE for the media stream and start sending media
   using IPv4.  However, it is also possible that ICE endpoint continues
   to perform ICE connectivity checks with IPv6 candidate pairs and if
   checks using higher-priority IPv6 candidate pair is successful then
   media stream can be moved to the IPv6 candidate pair.  Continuing to
   perform connectivity checks can be useful for subsequent connections,
   to optimize which connectivity checks are tried first.  Such
   optimization is out of scope of this document.

   The following diagram shows the behaviour during the connectivity
   check when Alice calls Bob and Agent Alice is the controlling agent
   and uses the aggressive nomination algorithm.  "USE-CAND" implies the
   presence of the USE-CANDIDATE attribute.

5.  Indicating Happy-Eyeballs

   To indicate that Happy Eyeballs Extension for ICE algorithm defined
   in this document is used, the ICE offerer MUST include ice-options
   attribute with "happy-eyeballs:N" option identifier in the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] ICE offer, where N indicates the
   position at which promotion is to occur.  If the ICE offer does not
   include this option tag, the answerer SHOULD NOT utilize the updated
   ICE algorithm defined in this document.  If the offer included the
   option tag and the answerer supports this specification, the answerer
   SHOULD add the same option tag to the response and use the Happy
   Eyeballs Extension for ICE algorithm.  If the ICE answer does not
   contain the option tag, the offerer SHOULD NOT use the updated ICE
   algorithm.  Recommended value for 'N' is 3.  As IPv6 becomes more
   prevalent, the value of 'N' can be increased as desired.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register "happy-eyeballs" option identifier
   under the "ICE Options" [RFC6336] registry.

   The required registration information is as follows:

   Option identifier: happy-eyeballs

   Contact: Tirumaleswar Reddy, tireddy@cisco.com

   Change control: IETF

   Description: Existence of this option identifier indicates that Happy
   Eyeballs Extension for ICE algorithm is used.
