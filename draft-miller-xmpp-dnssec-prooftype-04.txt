 Using DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) and DNS-based Authentication of
 Named Entities (DANE) as a Prooftype for XMPP Domain Name Associations
                 draft-miller-xmpp-dnssec-prooftype-04

Abstract

   This document defines a prooftype that uses DNS-based Authentication
   of Named Entities (DANE) for associating a domain name with an XML
   stream in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).  It
   also defines a method that uses DNS Security (DNSSEC) for securely
   delegating a source domain to a derived domain in XMPP.

1.  Introduction

   The [XMPP-DNA] specification defines a framework for secure
   delegation and strong domain name associations (DNA) in the
   Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).  This document
   defines a secure delegation method that uses DNS Security (DNSSEC)
   [RFC4033] in conjuction with the standard DNS SRV records [RFC2782]
   employed in domain name resolution in XMPP, with the result that a
   client or peer server that inititates an XMPP stream can legitimately
   treat a derived domain as a reference identifier during stream
   negotiation.  This document also defines a DNA prooftype that uses
   DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities [RFC6698] (DANE) to verify
   TLS certificates containing source domains or derived domains during
   stream negotiation.

2.  Terminology

   This document inherits XMPP terminology from [RFC6120], DNS
   terminology from [RFC1034], [RFC1035], [RFC2782] and [RFC4033], and

Internet-Draft            XMPP DANE Prooftype              February 2013


   security terminology from [RFC4949] and [RFC5280].  The terms "source
   domain", "derived domain", "reference identifier", and "presented
   identifier" are used as defined in the "CertID" specification
   [RFC6125].

   This document is applicable to connections made from an XMPP client
   to an XMPP server ("_xmpp-client._tcp") or between XMPP servers
   ("_xmpp-server._tcp").  In both cases, the XMPP initiating entity
   acts as a TLS client and the XMPP receiving entity acts as a TLS
   server.  Therefore, to simplify discussion this document uses "_xmpp-
   client._tcp" to describe to both cases, unless otherwise indicated.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  Requirements

   An XMPP initiating entity (TLS client) that wishes to use the DNSSEC
   prooftype MUST do so before exchanging stanzas addressed to the
   source domain.  In general, this means that the proof MUST be
   completed before the XMPP stream is restarted following STARTTLS
   negotiation (as specified in [RFC6120]).  However, connections
   between XMPP servers MAY also use this prooftype to verify the
   addition of new source domains onto an existing connection, such as
   multiplexing or "piggybacking" via [XEP-0220].

4.  Secure Delegation using DNS SRV

   In order to determine if delegation using DNS SRV records is secure,
   an XMPP initiating entity (TLS client) performs the following
   actions:

   1.  Query for the appropriate SRV resource record for the source
       domain (e.g., "_xmpp-client._tcp.im.example.com").

   2.  If there is no SRV resource record, pursue the fallback methods
       described in [RFC6120].

   3.  If there is an SRV resource record, validate that the SRV record
       answer is secure according to [RFC4033].  If the answer is
       insecure, then delegation to the derived domain(s), as indicated
       by the "target host" field, is insecure and the TLS client MUST
       treat only the source domain as a reference identifier during
       certificate verification, as described in [RFC6120]; if the
       answer is bogus, the TLS client MUST abort.

   4.  If the answer is secure, the TLS client SHOULD consider any
       derived domain(s) in the answer as securely delegated; during
       certificate verification, the TLS client MUST treat both the
       source domain and the derived domain to which it has connected as
       reference identifiers.

   The foregoing secure delegation method can be used with the DANE
   prooftype defined below, or with the PKIX prooftype specified in
   [RFC6120].

5.  DANE Prooftype

   DANE provides additional tools to verify the keys used in TLS
   connections.  A TLS client MAY use DANE for TLS certificate
   verification; its use depends on the delegation status of the source
   domain, as described in the following sections.

5.1.  No Service Records

   If no SRV records are found for the source domain, then the TLS
   client MUST query for a TLSA resource record as described in
   [RFC6698], where the prepared domain name MUST contain the source
   domain and the IANA-registered port 5222 for client-to-server streams
   (e.g., "_5222._tcp.im.example.com") or the IANA-registered port 5269
   for server-to-server streams (e.g., "_5269._tcp.im.example.com").

   In this case, the TLS client MUST treat only the source domain as its
   reference identifier during certificate verification, as described in
   [RFC6120].

5.2.  Insecure Delegation

   If the delegation of a source domain to a derived domain is not
   secure, then the TLS client MUST NOT make a TLSA record query to the
   derived domain as described in [RFC6698].  Instead, the TLS client
   MUST treat only the source domain as its reference identifier during
   certificate verification, as described in [RFC6120], and MUST NOT use
   DANE.

5.3.  Secure Delegation

   If the source domain has been delegated to a derived domain in a
   secure manner as described under Section 4, then the TLS client MUST
   query for a TLSA resource record as described in [RFC6698], where the
   prepared domain name MUST contain the derived domain and a port
   obtained from the SRV answer (e.g., "_5555._tcp/hosting.example.net"
   for an SRV record such as "_xmpp-client._tcp.im.example.com IN TLSA 1
   1 5555 hosting.example.net").

Internet-Draft            XMPP DANE Prooftype              February 2013


   If no TLSA resource records exist for the specified service, then the
   TLS client MUST perform certificate verification as described under
   Section 4.

   If TLSA resource records exist for the specified service, then the
   TLS client MUST treat the derived domain(s) as its reference
   identifier during certificate verification, using the information
   from the TLSA answer as the basis for verification as described in
   [RFC6698].

6.  Order of Operations

   The processes for the DANE prooftype MUST be complete before the TLS
   handshake over the XMPP connection finishes, so that the client can
   perform verification of reference identities.  To that end, a TLS
   client SHOULD perform the processes for this prooftype as part of its
   normal DNS resolution of the source domain into a socket address.
   Validating secure delegation ought to be done immediately upon
   receiving the answers to the SRV and follow-up A/AAAA queries;
   queries for TLSA records ought to be done once the target service is
   determined (whether the source domain and IANA-registered port, or
   delegated domain and port).

   Ideally a TLS client will perform the DNSSEC and DANE processes in
   parallel with other XMPP session establishment processes where
   possible (e.g., perform the TLSA resource queries as the socket
   connection is made to the server); this is sometimes called the
   "happy eyeballs" approach, similar to [RFC6555] for IPv4 and IPv6.
   However, a TLS client might delay as much of the XMPP session
   establishment as it needs to in order to gather all of the DNSSEC-
   and DANE-based verification material.  For instance, a TLS client
   might not open the socket connection until it has validated the
   secure delegation, or it might delay beginning the TLS handshake
   until it has obtained the TLSA certificate verification material.

7.  Internationalization Considerations

   If the SRV, A/AAAA, and TLSA record queries are for an
   internationalized domain name, then they need to use the A-label form
   as defined in [RFC5890].

8.  Security Considerations

   This document supplements but does not supersede the security
   considerations provided in [RFC4033], [RFC6120], [RFC6125], and
   [RFC6698].
