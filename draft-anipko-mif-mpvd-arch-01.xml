    <abstract>
      <t>This document is a product of the work of MIF architecture design team.
 It outlines a solution framework for some of the issues, experienced by 
nodes that can be attached to multiple networks. The framework defines the notion 
of a Provisioning Domain (PVD) - a consistent 
set of network configuration information, and PVD-aware nodes - nodes which 
learn PVDs from the attached network(s) and/or other sources and manage and use multiple PVDs 
for connectivity separately and consistently.</t>

<section title="Introduction">

<t>Nodes attached to multiple networks may encounter problems due to conflict 
of the networks configuration  and/or simultaneous use of the multiple 
available networks. While existing implementations apply various techniques (<xref
      target="RFC6419"></xref>) to tackle such problems, 
in many cases the issues may still appear. The MIF problem statement document <xref
      target="RFC6418"></xref> 
describes the general landscape as well as discusses many specific issues details.</t>

<t>Across the layers, problems enumerated in <xref
      target="RFC6418"></xref> can be grouped into 3 categories:

<list style="numbers">
          <t>Lack of consistent and distinctive management of configuration elements, associated 
 with different networks.</t>
          <t>Inappropriate mixed use of configuration elements, associated with different networks, 
in the course of a particular network activity / connection.</t>
          <t>Use of a particular network, not consistent with the intent of the scenario / involved parties, 
leading to connectivity failure and / or other undesired consequences.</t>
        </list>
As an illustration: an example of (1) is a single node-scoped list of DNS server IP addresses, learned 
from different networks, leading to failures or delays in resolution of name from particular namespaces; 
an example of (2) is use of an attempt to resolve a name of a HTTP proxy server, learned from a network A, 
with a DNS server, learned from a network B, likely to fail; an example of (3) is a use of employer-sponsored 
VPN connection for peer-to-peer connections, unrelated to employment activities.</t>

<t>This architecture describes a solution to these categories of problems, respectively, by:
<list style="numbers">
<t>Introducing a formal notion of the PVD, including PVD identity, and ways for nodes to learn the intended 
associations among acquired network configuration information elements.</t>
<t>Introducing a reference model for a PVD-aware node, preventing inadvertent mixed use of the configuration 
information, which may belong to different PVDs.</t>
<t>Providing recommendations on PVD selection based on PVD identity and connectivity tests for common scenarios.</t>
</list></t>

</section>

<section anchor="pvd_definitions" title="Definitions and types of PVDs">

<t>Provisioning Domain: a consistent set of network configuration information.  
Classically, the entire set available on a single interface is provided by a single source, 
such as network administrator, and can therefore be treated as a single provisioning domain. 
In modern IPv6 networks, multihoming can result in more than one provisioning domain
being present on a single link. In some scenarios, it is also possible for elements
of the same domain to be present on multiple links.</t>

<t>
Typical examples of information in a provisioning domain, learned from the network, 
are: source address prefixes, to be used by connections within the provisioning domain, 
IP address of DNS server, name of HTTP proxy server if available, DNS suffixes associated with the network etc.</t>

<t>In some cases, other sources, such as e.g., node local policy, user input or other 
out of band mechanisms may be used to either construct a PVD entirely (analogously to static IP configuration 
of an interface), or supplement with particular elements all or some PVDs learned from the network.
</t>

<t> 
As an example, node administrator could inject a not ISP-specific DNS server into PVDs for any 
of the networks the node could become attached to. Such creation / augmentation of PVD(s) could be static or dynamic. 
The particular implementation mechanisms are outside of the scope of this document.</t>

<t>PVD-aware node: a node that supports association of network configuration information into PVDs, 
and using the resultant PVDs to serve requests for network connections in a way, 
consistent with recommendations of this architecture.</t>

    <section title="Explicit and implicit PVDs">
<t>A node may receive explicit information from the network and/or other sources, about presence 
of PVDs and association of particular network information with a particular PVD. 
PVDs, constructed based on such information, are referred to in this document as "explicit".</t> 

<t>Protocol changes/extensions will likely be required to support the explicit PVDs. As an example, 
one could think of one or several DHCP options, defining a PVD identity and elements. 
A different approach could be to introduce a DHCP option, which only introduces identity of a PVD, 
while the association of network information elements with that identity, is implemented by the 
respective protocols - such as e.g., with a <xref
        target="RFC4861">Router Discovery</xref> option declaring association 
of an address range with a particular PVD.</t>

<t>Specific, existing or new, features of networking protocols to enable delivery of PVD identity 
and association with various network information elements will be defined in companion design documents.</t>

<t>It is likely that for a long time there may be networks which do not advertise any explicit PVD information, 
since deployment of any new features in networking protocols is a relatively slow process. 
When connected to such networks, PVD-aware nodes may still provide benefits to their users, 
compared to non-PVD aware nodes, by creating separate PVDs for configuration received on different interfaces. 
Such PVDs are referred to in this document as "implicit".  This allows the node to manage and use network 
information from different interfaces separately and consistently use the configuration to serve network 
connection requests.</t>

<t>In the mixed mode, where e.g. multiple networks are available on the link the interface is attached to, 
and only some of the networks advertize PVD information, the PVD-aware node shall create explicit PVDs based 
on explicitly learned PVD information, and associate the rest of the configuration with an implicit 
PVD created for that interface.</t>

<t>It shall be possible for networks to communicate that some of their configuration elements could be used within 
a context of other networks/PVDs.
 Based on such declaration and their policies, PVD-aware nodes may choose to inject such elements into some 
or all other PVDs they connect to.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Relationship between PVDs and interfaces">
<t>Implicit PVDs are limited to network configuration information received on a single interface. 
Explicit PVDs, in practice will often also be scoped to a configuration related to a particular interface, 
however per this architecture there is no such requirement or limitation and as defined in this architecture, explicit 
PVDs may include information related to more than one interfaces, if the node learns presence of the same 
PVD on those interfaces and the authentication of the PVD ID meets the level required by the node policy.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="PVD identity/naming">

<t>For explicit PVDs, PVD ID (globally unique ID, that possibly is human-readable) is received as part of that 
information. For implicit PVDs, the node assigns a locally generated globally unique ID to each implicit PVD.</t> 

<t>PVD-aware node may use these IDs to choose a PVD with matching ID for special-purpose connection requests, 
in accordance with node policy or choice by advanced applications, and/or to present human-readable IDs to the 
end-user for selection of Internet-connected PVDs.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Relationship to dual-stack networks">

<t>When applied to dual-stack networks, the PVD definition allows for multiple PVDs to be created, 
where each PVD contain information for only one address family, or for a single PVD that contains 
information about multiple address families. This architecture requires that accompanying design documents 
for accompanying protocol changes must support PVDs containing information from multiple address families.
PVD-aware nodes must be capable of dealing with both single-family and multi-family PVDs.</t>

<t>Nevertheless, for explicit PVDs, the choice of either of the approaches is a policy decision 
of a network administrator and/or node user/administrator. Since some of the IP configuration information 
that can be learned from the network can be applicable to multiple address families (for instance <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-6man-addr-select-opt">DHCP address selection option</xref>), 
it is likely that dual-stack networks will deploy single PVDs for both address families.</t>

<t>For implicit PVDs, by default PVD-aware nodes shall including multiple IP families into single 
implicit PVD created for an interface.</t>
  
<t>A PVD-aware node that provides API to use / enumerate / inspect PVDs and/or their properties shall provide 
ability to filter PVDs and/or their properties by address family.</t>

    <section title="Consistent use of PVDs for network connections">

        <t>PVDs enable PVD-aware nodes to use consistently a correct set of configuration elements to serve 
the specific network requests from beginning to end. This section describes specific examples of such 
consistent use.</t>

        <section title="Name resolution">

<t>When PVD-aware node needs to resolve a name of the destination used by a connection request, 
the node could decide to use one, or multiple PVDs for a given name lookup.</t>

<t> The node shall chose one PVD, if e.g., the node policy required to use a particular PVD for a 
particular purpose (e.g. to download an MMS using a specific APN over a cellular connection). 
To make the choice, the node could use a match of 
the PVD DNS suffix or other form of PVD ID, as determined by the node policy.</t>

<t>The node may pick multiple PVDs, if e.g., they are general purpose PVDs providing connectivity to
 the Internet, and the node desires to maximize chances for connectivity in Happy Eyeballs style. 
In this case, the node could do the lookups in parallel, or in sequence. Alternatively, the node 
may use for the lookup only one PVD, based on the PVD connectivity properties, 
user choice of the preferred Internet PVD, etc.</t>

<t>In either case, by default the node uses information obtained in
   a name service lookup to establish connections only within the
   same PVD from which the lookup results were obtained.</t>

<t>For simplicity, when we say that name service lookup results were
   obtained from a PVD, what we mean is that the name service query
   was issued against a name service the configuration of which is
   present in a particular PVD.   In that sense, the results are
   "from" that particular PVD.</t>

        </section>
        <section title="Next-hop and source address selection">

<t>For the purpose of this discussion, let's assume the preceding name lookup succeeded in a particular PVD.  
For each obtained destination address, the node shall perform a next-hop lookup among routers, 
associated with that PVD. As an example, such association could be determined by the node via matching 
the source address prefixes/specific routes advertized by the router against known PVDs, 
or receiving explicit PVD affiliation advertized through a new <xref
        target="RFC4861">Router Discovery</xref> option.</t>

<t>For each destination, once the best next-hop is found, the node selects best source address according 
to the <xref target="RFC6724"></xref> rules, but with a constraint that the source address 
must belong to a range associated 
with the used PVD. If needed, the node would use the prefix policy from the same PVD for the best source
 address selection among multiple candidates.</t>

<t>When destination/source pairs are identified, then they are sorted using the 
<xref target="RFC6724"></xref> 
destination sorting rules and the prefix policy table from the used PVD.</t>

<section title="PVD support in APIs">
<t> In all cases changes in available PVDs must be somehow exposed, appropriately for each of the approaches.</t>

    <section title="Basic">
<t>Applications are not PVD-aware in any manner, and only submit
   connection requests.  The node performs PVD selection implicitly,
   without any otherwise applications participation, and based purely on
   node-specific administrative policies and/or choices made by the user
   in a user interface provided by the operating environment, not by the application.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Intermediate">
<t>Applications indirectly participate in selection of PVD by specifying hard requirements and 
soft preferences. The node performs PVD selection, based on applications inputs and policies and/or 
user preferences. Some / all properties of the resultant PVD may be exposed to applications.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Advanced">
<t>PVDs are directly exposed to applications, for enumeration and selection. Node polices and/or user choices, 
may still override the application preferences and limit which PVD(s) can be enumerated and/or used by the application, 
irrespectively of any preferences which application may have specified. Depending on the implementation, such restrictions,
imposed per node policy and/or user choice, may or may not be visible to the application.</t>

</section>

<section title="PVD-aware nodes trust to PVDs">

    <section title="Untrusted PVDs">

<t>Implicit and explicit PVDs for which no trust relationship exists
   are considered untrusted.   Only PVDs, which meet the requirements in
   <xref target="Trusted_PVDs"></xref>, are trusted; any other PVD is untrusted.</t>

<t>
   In order to avoid various forms of misinformation that can be asserted
   when PVDs are untrusted, nodes that implement PVD separation cannot assume
   that two explicit PVDs with the same identifier are actually the same PVD.
   A node that did make this assumption would be vulnerable to attacks where
   for example an open Wifi hotspot might assert that it was part of another PVD, 
   and thereby might draw traffic intended for that PVD onto its own
   network.</t>

<t>Since implicit PVD identifiers are synthesized by the node, this issue
   cannot arise with implicit PVDs.</t>

<t>
   Mechanisms exist (for example, <xref
        target="RFC6731"></xref>) whereby a PVD can
   provide configuration information that asserts special knowledge about
   the reachability of resources through that PVD.   Such assertions
   cannot be validated unless the node has a trust relationship with
   the PVD; assertions of this type therefore must be ignored by
   nodes that receive them from untrusted PVDs.   Failure to ignore
   such assertions could result in traffic being diverted from legitimate
   destinations to spoofed destinations.</t>

    </section>
    <section anchor="Trusted_PVDs" title="Trusted PVDs">
<t>
Trusted PVDs are PVDs for which two conditions apply.   First, a trust
   relationship must exist between the node that is using the PVD configuration
   and the source that provided that configuration; this is the authorization
   portion of the trust relationship.   Second, there must
   be some way to validate the trust relationship.   This is the authentication
   portion of the trust relationship.   Two mechanisms for
   validating the trust relationship are defined.
</t>
        <section anchor="Authenticated_PVDs" title="Authenticated PVDs">
<t>One way to validate the trust relationship between a node and the
   source of a PVD is through the combination of cryptographic
   authentication and an identifier configured on the node.   In some
   cases, the two could be the same; for example, if authentication is
   done with a shared secret, the secret would have to be associated
   with the PVD identifier.   Without a (PVD Identifier, shared key)
   tuple, authentication would be impossible, and hence authentication
   and authorization are combined.</t>

<t>However, if authentication is done using
   some public key mechanism such as a TLS cert or DANE, authentication
   by itself isn't enough, since theoretically any PVD could be
   authenticated in this way.   In addition to authentication, the node
   would need to be configured to trust the identifier being authenticated.
   Validating the authenticated PVD name against a list of PVD names
   configured as trusted on the node would constitute the authorization
   step in this case.</t>

        </section>
        <section title="PVDs trusted by attachment">
<t>In some cases a trust relationship may be validated by some means
   other than described in <xref target="Authenticated_PVDs"></xref>, simply by virtue of the connection
   through which the PVD was obtained.   For instance, a handset connected
   to a mobile network may know through the mobile network infrastructure
   that it is connected to a trusted PVD, and whatever mechanism was used
   to validate that connection constitutes the authentication portion of
   the PVD trust relationship.   Presumably such a handset would be configured
   from the factory, or else through mobile operator or user preference settings, to trust
   the PVD, and this would constitute the authorization portion of this
   type of trust relationship.</t>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
