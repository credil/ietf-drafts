    <abstract>
      <t>The Diameter protocol allows a Diameter redirect agent to specify
      one or more individual hosts to which a Diameter message may be
      redirected by an upstream Diameter node. However, in some
      circumstances an operator may wish to redirect messages to an
      alternate domain without specifying individual hosts. This document
      specifies a mechanism by which this can be achieved. New applications
      may incorporate this capability by reference to the present document.
      </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

<section title="Introduction">
    
  <t>The usual redirect indication, as described in Section 6.1.8 and
  Sections 6.12-6.14 of <xref target="RFC3588bis"/>, returns one or more
  individual host names to the upstream Diameter node. However, consider
  the case where an operator has offered a specific service but no
  longer wishes to do so. The operator has arranged for an alternative
  domain to provide the service. To aid in the transition to the new
  arrangement, the original operator maintains a redirect server to
  indicate the alternative destination to upstream nodes. However, the
  original operator has no interest in configuring a list of hosts in
  the alternative operator's domain, and would prefer simply to provide
  redirect indications to the domain as a whole.</t>

  <t>As an example of another use case, consider a 3GPP IMS deployment
  where subscriber data is provisioned in a geo-redundant Home
  Subscriber Server (HSS) cluster for reliability. Each Application
  Server (AS) needs to maintain redundant Diameter Sh links to both
  cluster nodes for scalability. It is preferable that the AS should go
  to the local HSS cluster node when it is available. It would be useful
  for a cluster node to be able to redirect an AS request to its partner
  node in the cluster without specifying the individual Sh link to that
  alternate node. This could be accomplished by identifying each cluster
  node with a separate realm and individual Sh links with separate
  servers, and redirecting on the basis of realm rather than individual
  server. There can be multiple geo-redundant HSS clusters, in which
  case the Subscriber Location Function (SLF) performs the redirection.
  </t>

  <t>Within this specification, the term "realm-based redirection" is
  used to refer to a mode of operation where the redirect indication
  specifies a realm and the upstream Diameter node reroutes the message
  to the realm rather than an individual host.</t>

  <section title="Requirements Language">
   
    <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
    target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

<section anchor="applic" title="Support of Realm-Based Redirection
                    Within Applications">

  <t>Because realm-based redirection is not part of base Diameter
  behaviour, support for realm-based redirection by the agent MUST be
  specified as part of particular applications. In this way, Diameter's
  capability negotiation mechanism can be used indirectly to indicate
  support for realm-based redirection by indicating support for the
  applications concerned. Designers of new applications can incorporate
  the mechanism specified here into their application by normative reference to
  this document. </t>

  <t>The result of making realm-based redirection an 
  application-specific behaviour is that it cannot be performed by a redirect
  agent, but instead must be performed by a Diameter server. However,
  despite the change in executing role, the behaviour itself is a slight 
  modification of the behaviour of a redirect agent.</t>

<section anchor="solution" title="Realm-Based Redirection">

  <t>This section specifies an extension to <xref target="RFC3588bis"/> to
  achieve realm-based redirection. The elements of this solution are:
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>a new result code, DIAMETER_REALM_REDIRECT_INDICATION (3xxx
    TBD);</t>

    <t>one new attribute-value pair (AVP), Redirect-Realm; and </t> 

    <t>associated behaviour at Diameter nodes implementing this
    specification.</t>

  </t>
  
  <section anchor="config" title="Configuration of the Redirecting Server">

    <t>A Diameter server MUST be configured as follows to execute realm-based
    redirection:
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>configured with an application that incorporates realm-based 
      redirection;</t>
      
      <t>the Local Action field of the routing table described in Section 2.7
      of <xref target="RFC3588bis"/> is set to LOCAL; </t>
      
      <t>an application-specific field is set to indicate that the required 
      local action is to perform realm-based redirection;</t>
      
      <t>an associated application-specific field is configured with the 
      identities of one or more realms to which the request should be
      redirected.</t>

  <section anchor="behav" title="Behaviour of Diameter Nodes">
  
    <section anchor="redAgent_behav" title="Behaviour at the Redirecting Server">
    
      <t>An application incorporating realm-based redirection may specify that
      redirection applies for any request or only for the initial request of a
      session (i.e., to prevent disruption of established sessions). </t>

      <t>If a server configured as described in <xref target="config"/>
      receives a request for which the indicated local action is to perform
      realm-based redirection, the server MUST proceed as follows:

      <list style="symbols">
        <t>If the request contains a Destination-Host AVP, the
        server MUST set the 'E' bit in the answer and set the Result-Code
        AVP to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_DELIVER.
        </t>

        <t>Otherwise, the server MUST reply with an answer message with the
        'E' bit set, while maintaining the Hop-by-Hop Identifier in the
        header. The server MUST include the Result-Code AVP set to
        DIAMETER_REALM_REDIRECT_INDICATION. The server MUST also include 
        the alternate realm identifiers with which it has been configured, 
        each in a separate Redirect-Realm AVP instance.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/> 
        The server MAY include a copy of the Redirect-Host-Usage AVP,
        which SHOULD be set to REALM_AND_APPLICATION. If this AVP is added,
        the Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVP MUST also be included. Note that these
        AVPs apply to the peer discovered by a node acting on the server's
        response, as described in the next section. </t>
      </list>
      </t>

    <section anchor="proxy_behav" title="Proxy Behaviour">
    
      <t>A proxy conforming to this specification that receives an answer
      message with the Result-Code AVP set to
      DIAMETER_REALM_REDIRECT_INDICATION MAY attempt to reroute the original
      request to a server in a realm identified by a Redirect-Realm AVP
      instance in the answer message. If it does so, it
      MUST take the following steps: 
      <list style="numbers">
      
        <t>Select a specific realm from amongst those identified in instances
        of the Redirect-Realm AVP in the answer message.</t>

        <t>Verify that the new realm is authorized to provide the requested
        service on behalf of the realm specified in the original request.</t>

        <t>If successful, locate and establish a route to a peer in the
        realm given by the Redirect-Realm AVP, using normal discovery
        procedures as described in Section 5.2 of <xref target="RFC3588bis"/>.
        </t>

        <t> If again successful: 
        <list style="letters">
          <t>update its cache of routing entries for the realm and application
          to which the original request was directed, taking into account the
          Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVPs, if present in
          the answer.</t>

          <t>Remove the Destination-Host (if present) and Destination-Realm AVPs
          from the original request and add a new Destination-Realm AVP
          containing the realm selected in the initial step.</t>

          <t>Forward the modified request.</t>
        </list>
        </t>
        
        <t>If any of the preceding steps 2-4 fail and additional realms have
        been identified in the original answer, select another instance of the
        Redirect-Realm AVP in that answer and repeat steps 2-4 for the realm
        that it identifies.</t>
      </list>
      </t>

    <section anchor="cli_behav" title="Client Behaviour">

      <t>A client conforming to this specification MUST be prepared to
      receive either an answer message containing a Result-Code AVP set to
      DIAMETER_REALM_REDIRECT_INDICATION, or, as the result of proxy action,
      some other result from a realm differing from the one to which it sent
      the original request. In the case where it receives
      DIAMETER_REALM_REDIRECT_INDICATION, the client SHOULD follow the same
      steps prescribed in the previous section for a proxy, in order both to
      update its routing table and to obtain service for the original
      request. In other cases, the client SHOULD verify that the realm from
      which it received the response is authorized to act on behalf of the
      realm to which it directed the original request. If this authorization
      fails, the response SHOULD be ignored. </t>

  <t>Because realm-based redirection implies a change in business
