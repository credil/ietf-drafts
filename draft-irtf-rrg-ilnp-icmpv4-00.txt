   This document is part of the ILNP document set, which has had
   extensive review within the IRTF Routing Research Group.  ILNP is
   one of the recommendations made by the RG Chairs. Separately,
   various refereed research papers on ILNP have also been published
   during this decade. So the ideas contained herein have had much
   broader review than the IRTF Routing RG. The views in this
   document were considered controversial by the Routing RG, but the
   RG reached a consensus that the document still should be
   published. The Routing RG has had remarkably little consensus on
   anything, so virtually all Routing RG outputs are considered
   controversial.

Abstract

   This document defines a new ICMP message type for IPv4 that is
   used only with ILNP for IPv4 (ILNPv4).  The Identifier-Locator
   Network Protocol (ILNP) is an experimental, evolutionary
   enhancement to IP.  This document is a product of the IRTF
   Routing RG.

1. INTRODUCTION

   The Identifier Locator Network Protocol (ILNP) is an proposal for
   evolving the Internet Architecture.  It differs from the current
   Internet Architecture primarily by deprecating the concept of an

   IP Address, and instead defining two new objects, each having
   crisp syntax and semantics.  The first new object is the Locator,
   a topology-dependent name for a subnetwork.  The other new object
   is the Identifier, which provides a topology-independent name for
   a node.

1.1  ILNP Document Roadmap

   The ILNP Architecture document [ILNP-ARCH] is the best place to
   start reading about ILNP.  ILNP has multiple instantiations.
   [ILNP-ENG] discusses engineering and implementation aspects
   common to all instances of ILNP.  [ILNP-v4opts] defines two new
   IPv4 options used with ILNPv4.  This document discusses a new
   ICMP for IPv4 message.  [ILNP-DNS] describes new Domain Name
   System (DNS) resource records used with ILNP.  Other documents
   describe ILNP for IPv6 (ILNPv6).

1.2  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
   in RFC 2119. [RFC-2119]


2.  ICMP Locator Update message for ILNPv4

   As described in [ILNP-ARCH] and [ILNP-ENG], an ILNP for IPv4
   (ILNPv4) node might need to inform correspondent ILNPv4 nodes of
   changes to the set of valid Locator values.  This message
   provides a mechanism to do so.  While it would be architecturally
   identical to perform this function using a new UDP protocol, this
   specification defines a new ICMP message type for such updates.

   The ICMP for IPv4 message described in this section has ICMP Type
   XXX and is used ONLY with a current ILNPv4 session.  This message
   enables an ILNPv4 node to inform ILNPv4 correspondent nodes of
   changes to the active Locator set for the ILNPv4 node that
   originates this message.  This particular ICMP for IPv4 message
   MUST ONLY be used with ILNPv4 communications sessions.

         Locator[i],           The 32-bit Locator values used at present
          i = 1..Num Addrs     by the sending ILNPv4 node.

         Preference[i],        The preferability of each Locator[i],
          i = 1..Num Addrs     relative to other valid Locator[i]
                               values. The Preference numbers here are
                               identical, both in syntax and semantics,
                               to the Preference values for L32 records
                               as specified by [ILNP-DNS].

          RESERVED             A field reserved for possible future
                               use.  At present, the sender MUST
                               initialise this field to zero.
                               Receivers should ignore this field at
                               present.  The field might be used for
                               some protocol function in future.


   All ILNPv4 ICMP Locator Update messages MUST contain a valid
   ILNPv4 Identifier option and MUST contain an ILNPv4 Nonce Option.

   ILNPv4 ICMP Locator Update messages also MAY be protected using
   IP Security for ILNP [ILNP-ENG] [RFC-4301].  Deployments in
   high-threat environments SHOULD also protect ILNPv4 ICMP Locator
   Update messages using IP Security.  While IPsec ESP can protect a
   payload, no form of IPsec ESP is able to protect an IPv4 option
   that appears prior to the ESP header.  Note that even when IP
   Security for ILNP is in use, the ILNP Nonce Option still MUST be
   present.  This simplifies protocol processing, and it also
   means that a receiver can perform the inexpensive check of
   the Nonce value before performing any (potentially expensive)
   cryptographic calculation.

3.  SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

   Security considerations for the overall ILNP Architecture
   are described in [ILNP-ARCH].  Additional common security
   considerations are described in [ILNP-ENG].  This section
   describes security considerations specific to ILNPv4 topics
   discussed in this document.

   If the ILNP Nonce value is predictable, then an off-path attacker
   might be able to forge data or control packets.  This risk also
   is mitigated by the existing common practice of IP Source Address
   filtering [RFC-2827] [RFC-3704].

   IP Security for ILNP [ILNP-ENG] [RFC-4301] provides cryptographic
   protection for ILNP data and control packets. The ILNP Nonce

   option [ILNP-v4opts] is required as described in Section 3, even
   if IP Security is also in use.  Deployments of ILNPv4 in
   high-threat environments SHOULD use IP Security for additional
   risk reduction.


4.  IANA CONSIDERATIONS

   IANA is requested to assign a new ICMP Type number for this ICMP
   Locator Update message, replacing XXX above, following the
   procedures in [RFC-2939].

   The ICMP Locator Update message does not use the ICMP Extension
   Structure defined in [RFC-4884].  At present, the only ICMP Code
   valid for this ICMP Type is zero (0), which means "No Code".
