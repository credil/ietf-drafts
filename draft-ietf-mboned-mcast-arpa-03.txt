     Moving MCAST.NET into the ARPA infrastructure top level domain
                    draft-ietf-mboned-mcast-arpa-03

Abstract

   This document proposes to migrate the MCAST.NET domain into the ARPA
   top level domain, which is dedicated to infrastructure support.  It
   also provides a maintenance policy for the new MCAST.ARPA domain,
   related registrations in IN-ADDR.ARPA and describes the migration
   process.  This document updates RFC 5771 and forms part of BCP 51.

Internet-Draft             Rehoming MCAST.NET                  July 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the migration strategy from the MCAST.NET
   domain to MCAST.ARPA, which MUST contains DNS names for a subset of
   the multicast groups assigned by the IANA.  It also specifies a
   maintenance policy for the MCAST.ARPA domain.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].


3.  The ARPA top level domain

   [RFC3172] designates the ARPA top level domain as "Address and
   Routing Parameters Area" to be used for infrastructure applications.

   The MCAST.NET second level domain fulfills the criteria set out in
   section 2.1 of [RFC3172].  However, there is no standards track
   document explicitly designating this domain to a multicast group name
   to multicast group address mapping.

   The assignment of IPv4 multicast addresses is governed by BCP51
   [RFC5771].  IPv6 multicast address assignment is dealt with in
   [RFC3307] and section 2.7 of [RFC4291].


4.  Current Use

   Currently the zone MCAST.NET reflects the contents of parts the IANA
   IPv4 multicast address registry.  However, some names are missing
   from the DNS zone and some names used differ from the description
   that appears in the registry file.  Entries in the IPv6 multicast
   address registry are not reflected in the MCAST.NET zone.

   With few exceptions, only multicast group addresses from 224.0.0/24
   and 224.0.1/24 are listed in MCAST.NET.  Addresses outside 224/8 do
   not appear at all.


5.  Registration Policy

   Names within MCAST.ARPA will consist of one additional label and MUST
   adhere to the hostname syntax requirements of [RFC1123].  These names
   MUST own a single A RR, a single AAAA RR, or both.  Addresses will be

Internet-Draft             Rehoming MCAST.NET                  July 2011


   in the IPv4 or IPv6 multicast address space and recorded in the
   registry.

5.1.  Names and Addresses eligible for Registration in MCAST.ARPA

   Only IANA multicast address registrations are eligible for being
   listed in MCAST.ARPA.

   For IPv4, only multicast groups from 224.0.0/24 (Local Network
   Control Block) and 224.0.1/24 (Internetwork Control Block) will have
   names assigned.

   For IPv6, only multicast groups from FF01::/16 (Node-Local Scope
   Multicast Addresses) and FF02::/16 (Link-Local Scope Multicast
   Addresses) will have names assigned.

5.2.  Subdomains of MCAST.ARPA

   The namespace under MCAST.ARPA is considered flat, i.e., all direct
   descendants of MCAST.ARPA are leaves in the DNS tree.  Future
   extensions might want to define subdomains that serve special
   purposes.  Any such designation needs IETF consensus [RFC5226].

5.3.  Corresponding Reverse Mapping

   The DNS Reverse Mapping for those multicast groups that appear as
   addresses in MCAST.ARPA MUST remain consistent with the forward
   namespace.

5.3.1.  Reverse Mapping for 224/4

   A single DNS PTR record will be entered at the corresponding owner
   within the 224.IN-ADDR.ARPA domain that points to the multicast group
   name within MCAST.ARPA.

   The zones 225.IN-ADDR.ARPA through 239.IN-ADDR.ARPA will be delegated
   but MUST remain empty except for necessary infrastructure RRs.  The
   one exception is 233.IN-ADDR.ARPA.  A mechanism for the delegation of
   reverse mapping for GLOP space [RFC3180] will be specified and
   documented on the IANA web site.

5.3.2.  Reverse Mapping for ff00::/8

   Directions for this will be published as a separate document.

6.  Migration Issues

   As described below, the current content of the MCAST.NET zone MUST be
   brought in line with the multicast address registry.

   Since legacy systems are likely to use MCAST.NET for quite some time,
   there needs to be a mapping/forwarding solution to answer those
   queries in a useful manner without discouraging migration.

   RFCs mentioning MCAST.NET are [RFC3261] and [RFC3678].

   An updated multicast address architecture appears in [RFC6308].

6.1.  Migration Strategies

   After the move, several options are available for the future handling
   of MCAST.NET.

   [[The working group needs to choose one of the options.]]

6.1.1.  Freeze

   The current MCAST.NET zone could be frozen, so that no additions,
   deletions or changes to the content (apart from those necessary for
   maintenance, e.g.  SOA and NS RRs) would be performed.  New
   registrations would only be available in MCAST.ARPA, so this could be
   an incentive for querying clients to alter their behavior as well.

6.1.2.  Removing Registrations from MCAST.NET while maintaining
        operational stability

   MCAST.NET will only see deletions but even after the last record has
   been deleted, the domain MUST be kept registered by the IANA. and
   should be operated in parallel using a DNAME RR, as described in
   [RFC2672].


7.  Security Considerations

   The usual Security Considerations for the DNS [RFC3833] apply.

   The MCAST.ARPA., MCAST.NET., and the Reverse mapping zones mentioned
   in this document MUST be DNSSEC signed by the IANA under direction
   from the IAB.

   There is no security problem associated with the migration itself.

   {This section needs more work.}

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document amends [RFC5771] to add a mandatory entry in the
   MCAST.ARPA domain and a corresponding reverse mapping entry, with
   relevant DNS names published in the registry.  The officially
   registered multicast group name is made subject to DNS hostname
   syntax rules.
