                  draft-ietf-tls-dtls-heartbeat-04.txt

Abstract

   This document describes the Heartbeat Extension for the Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
   protocol.

   The Heartbeat Extension provides a new protocol for TLS/DTLS allowing
   the usage of keep-alive functionality without performing a
   renegotiation and a basis for path maximum transmission unit (PMTU)
   discovery for DTLS.

Internet-Draft        TLS/DTLS Heartbeat Extension         December 2011


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   This document describes the Heartbeat Extension for the Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
   protocols, as defined in [RFC5246] and [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4347-bis] and
   their adaptations to specific transport protocols described in
   [RFC3436], [RFC5238], and [RFC6083].

   DTLS is designed to secure traffic running on top of unreliable
   transport protocols.  Usually such protocols have no session
   management.  The only mechanism available at the DTLS layer to figure
   out if a peer is still alive is performing a costly renegotiation.
   If the application uses unidirectional traffic there is no other way.
   Furthermore, DTLS needs to perform path maximum transmission unit
   (PMTU) discovery but has no specific message type to realize it
   without affecting user message transfer.

   TLS is based on reliable protocols but there is not necessarily a
   feature available to keep the connection alive without continuous
   data transfer.

   The Heartbeat Extension as described in this document overcomes these
   limitations.  The user can use the new HeartbeatRequest message which
   has to be answered by the peer with a HeartbeartResponse immediately.
   To perform PMTU discovery, HeartbeatRequest messages containing
   padding can be used as probe packets as described in [RFC4821].

1.2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Heartbeat Hello Extension

   The support of Heartbeats is indicated with Hello Extensions.  A peer
   can not only indicate that its implementation supports Heartbeats, it
   can also choose whether it is willing to receive HeartbeatRequest
   messages and respond with HeartbeatResponse messages or only to send
   HeartbeatRequest messages.  The former is indicated by using
   peer_allowed_to_send as the HeartbeatMode, the latter is indicated by
   using peer_not_allowed_to_send as the Heartbeat mode.  This decision
   can be changed with every renegotiation.  HeartbeatRequest messages
   MUST NOT be sent to a peer indicating peer_not_allowed_to_send.  If
   an endpoint that has indicated peer_not_allowed_to_send receives a

Internet-Draft        TLS/DTLS Heartbeat Extension         December 2011


   HeartbeatRequest message, the endpoint SHOULD drop the message
   silently and MAY send an unexpected_message Alert message.

   The format of the Heartbeat Hello Extension is defined by:

   enum {
      peer_allowed_to_send(1),
      peer_not_allowed_to_send(2),
      (255)
   } HeartbeatMode;

   struct {
      HeartbeatMode mode;
   } HeartbeatExtension;

   Upon reception of an unknown mode, an error Alert message using
   illegal_parameter as its AlertDescription MUST be sent in response.


3.  Heartbeat Protocol

   The Heartbeat protocol is a new protocol on top of the Record Layer.
   The protocol itself consists of two message types: HeartbeatRequest
   and HeartbeatResponse.

   enum {
      heartbeat_request(1),
      heartbeat_response(2),
      (255)
   } HeartbeatMessageType;

   A HeartbeatRequest message can arrive almost at any time during the
   lifetime of a connection.  Whenever a HeartbeatRequest message is
   received, it SHOULD be answered with a corresponding
   HeartbeatResponse message.

   However, a HeartbeatRequest message SHOULD NOT be sent during
   handshakes.  If a handshake is initiated while a HeartbeatRequest is
   still in flight, the sending peer MUST stop the DTLS retransmission
   timer for it.  The receiving peer SHOULD discard it silently, if it
   arrives during the handshake.  In case of DTLS, HeartbeatRequest
   messages from older epochs SHOULD be discarded.

   There MUST NOT be more than one HeartbeatRequest message in flight at
   a time.  A HeartbeatRequest message is considered to be in flight
   until the corresponding HeartbeatResponse message is received, or
   until the retransmit timer expires.

Internet-Draft        TLS/DTLS Heartbeat Extension         December 2011


   When using an unreliable transport protocol like DCCP or UDP,
   HeartbeatRequest messages MUST be retransmitted using the simple
   timeout and retransmission scheme DTLS uses for flights as described
   in Section 4.2.4 of [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4347-bis].  In particular, after
   a number of retransmissions without receiving a corresponding
   HeartbeatResponse message having the expected payload the DTLS
   connection SHOULD be terminated.  The threshold used for this SHOULD
   be the same as for DTLS handshake messages.  Please note, that after
   the timer supervising a HeartbeatRequest messages expires, this
   message is no longer considered in flight.  Therefore the
   HeartbeatRequest message is eligible for retransmission.  The
   retransmission scheme in combination with the restriction that only
   one HeartbeatRequest is allowed to be in flight ensures that the
   congestion control is handled appropriately in case of the transport
   protocol not providing one, like in the case of DTLS over UDP.

   When using a reliable transport protocol like SCTP or TCP,
   HeartbeatRequest messages only need to be sent once.  The transport
   layer will handle retransmissions.  If no corresponding
   HeartbeatResponse message has been received after some amount of
   time, the DTLS/TLS connection MAY be terminated by the application
   that initiated the sending of the HeartbeatRequest message.


4.  Heartbeat Request and Response Messages

   The Heartbeat protocol messages consist of their type and an
   arbitrary payload and padding.

   struct {
      HeartbeatMessageType type;
      uint16 payload_length;
      opaque payload[HeartbeatMessage.payload_length];
      opaque padding[padding_length];
   } HeartbeatMessage;

   The length of a HeartbeatMessage in total MUST NOT exceed 2^14 or
   max_fragment_length when negotiated as defined in [RFC6066].

   type:  The message type, either heartbeat_request or
      heartbeat_response.

   payload_length:  The length of the payload.

   payload:  The payload consists of arbitrary content.

Internet-Draft        TLS/DTLS Heartbeat Extension         December 2011


   padding:  The padding is random content which MUST be ignored by the
      receiver.  The length of a HeartbeatMessage is TLSPlaintext.length
      for TLS and DTLSPlaintext.length for DTLS.  Furthermore the length
      of the type field is 1 byte and the length of the payload_length
      is 2.  Therefore, the padding_length is TLSPlaintext.length -
      payload_length - 3 for TLS and DTLSPlaintext.length -
      payload_length - 3 for DTLS.  The padding_length MUST be at least
      16.

   The sender of a HeartbeatMessage MUST use a random padding of at
   least 16 bytes.  The padding of a received HeartbeatMessage message
   MUST be ignored.

   If the payload_length of a received HeartbeatMessage is too large,
   the received HeartbeatMessage MUST be discarded silently.

   When a HeartbeatRequest message is received and sending a
   HeartbeatResponse is not prohibited as described elsewhere in this
   document, the receiver MUST send a corresponding HeartbeatResponse
   message carrying an exact copy of the payload of the received
   HeartbeatRequest.

   If a received HeartbeatResponse message does not contain the expected
   payload the message MUST be discarded silently.  If it does contain
   the expected payload the retransmission timer MUST be stopped.


5.  Use Cases

   Each endpoint sends HeartbeatRequest messages at a rate and with the
   padding required for the particular use case.  The endpoint should
   not expect its peer to send HeartbeatRequests.  The directions are
   independent.

5.1.  Path MTU Discovery

   DTLS performs path MTU discovery as described in Section 4.1.1.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4347-bis].  A detailed description how to perform
   path MTU discovery is given in [RFC4821].  The necessary probe
   packets are the HeartbeatRequest messages.

   This method using HeartbeatRequest messages for DTLS is similar to
   the one for the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) using the
   padding chunk (PAD-chunk) defined in [RFC4820].

Internet-Draft        TLS/DTLS Heartbeat Extension         December 2011


5.2.  Liveliness check

   Sending HeartbeatRequest messages allows the sender to make sure that
   it can reach the peer and the peer is alive.  Even in case of TLS/TCP
   this allows a check at a much higher rate than the TCP keep-alive
   feature would allow.

   Besides making sure that the peer is still reachable, sending
   HeartbeatRequest messages refreshes the NAT state of all involved
   NATs.

   HeartbeatRequest messages SHOULD only be sent after an idle period
   that is at least multiple round trip times long.  This idle period
   SHOULD to be configurable up to a period of multiple minutes and down
   to a period of one second.  A default value for the idle period
   SHOULD be configurable but it SHOULD also be tunable on a per peer
   basis.


6.  IANA Considerations

   [NOTE to RFC-Editor:

      "RFCXXXX" is to be replaced by the RFC number you assign this
      document.

   ]

   IANA needs to assign the heartbeat content type (value TBD) from the
   TLS ContentType Registry as specified in [RFC5246].  The reference
   should be RFCXXXX.

   IANA needs to maintain a new registry for Heartbeat Message Types.
   The message types are numbers in the range from 0 to 255 (decimal).
   Initially IANA needs to assign the heartbeat_request (suggested value
   1) and the heartbeat_response (suggested value 2) message type.  The
   values 0 and 255 should be reserved.  This registry uses the Expert
   Review policy as described in [RFC5226].  The reference should be
   RFCXXXX.

   IANA needs to assign the heartbeat extension type (value TBD) from
   the TLS Extension Type Registry as specified in [RFC5246].  The
   reference should be RFCXXXX.

   IANA needs to maintain a new registry for Heartbeat Modes.  The modes
   are numbers in the range from 0 to 255 (decimal).  Initially IANA
   needs to assign the peer_allowed_to_send (suggested value 1) and the
   peer_not_allowed_to_send (suggested value 2) modes.  The values 0 and

   255 should be reserved.  This registry uses the Expert Review policy
   as described in [RFC5226].  The reference should be RFCXXXX.


7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not add any additional security considerations in
   addition to the ones given in [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4347-bis] and
   [RFC5246].
