    <abstract>
      <t>The EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP) defines extensions to the
      Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) to support efficient re-
      authentication between the peer and an EAP Re-authentication (ER) server
      through a compatible authenticator. This document specifies Diameter
      support for ERP. It defines a new Diameter ERP application to transport
      ERP messages between an ER authenticator and the ER server, and a set of
      new AVPs that can be used to transport the cryptographic material needed
      by the re-authentication server.</t>

  <middle>
    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>RFC6696 <xref target="RFC6696"/> defines the EAP Re-authentication
      Protocol (ERP). It consists of the following steps:<list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Bootstrapping"><vspace blankLines="1"/>A root key for
          re-authentication is derived from the Extended Master Session Key
          (EMSK) created during EAP authentication <xref target="RFC5295"/>.
          This root key is transported from the EAP server to the ER
          server.</t>

          <t hangText="Re-authentication"><vspace blankLines="1"/>A
          one-round-trip exchange between the peer and the ER server,
          resulting in mutual authentication. To support the EAP
          reauthentication functionality, ERP defines two new EAP codes -
          EAP-Initiate and EAP-Finish.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This document defines how Diameter transports the ERP messages during
      the re-authentication process. For this purpose, we define a new
      Application Identifier for ERP, and re-use the Diameter EAP commands
      (DER/DEA).</t>

      <t>This document also discusses the distribution of the root key during
      bootstrapping, in conjunction with either the initial EAP authentication
      (implicit bootstrapping) or the first ERP exchange (explicit
      bootstrapping). Security considerations for this key distribution are
      detailed in RFC 5295 <xref target="RFC5295"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>This document uses terminology defined in RFC3748 <xref
      target="RFC3748"/>, RFC5295 <xref target="RFC5295"/>, RFC6696 <xref
      target="RFC6696"/>, and RFC4072 <xref target="RFC4072"/>.</t>

      <t>"Root key" (RK) or "bootstrapping material" refer to the rRK or rDSRK
      derived from an EMSK, depending on the location of the ER server in home
      or foreign domain.</t>

      <t>We use the notation "ERP/DER" and "ERP/DEA" in this document to refer
      to Diameter-EAP-Request and Diameter-EAP-Answer commands with the
      Application Id set to &lt;Diameter ERP Application&gt; <xref
      target="DAI"/>; the same commands are denoted "EAP/DER" and "EAP/DEA"
      when the Application Id in the message is set to &lt;Diameter EAP
      Application&gt; <xref target="RFC4072"/>.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Assumptions">
      <t>This document assumes the existence of at most one logical ER server
      entity in a domain. If several physical servers are deployed for
      robustness, a replication mechanism must be deployed to synchronize the
      ERP states (root keys) between these servers. This replication mechanism
      is out of the scope of this document. If multiple ER servers are
      deployed in the domain, we assume that they can be used interchangeably.
      If multiple ER servers are deployed across the domains, we assume only
      one ER server that is near to the peer is getting involved in the
      ERP.</t>

      <t>Also this document assumes the existence of at most one EAP server
      entity in the home domain. In case of multiple physical home EAP servers
      in the same domain, if the ER server wants to reach the same home EAP
      server, the ER server may cache the Destination-Host AVP corresponding
      to the home EAP server it requests.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Overview" title="Protocol Overview">
      <t>The following figure shows the components involved in ERP, and their
      interactions.</t>

      </figure>

      <t>The ER server is located either in the home domain (same as EAP
      server) or in the visited domain (same as authenticator, when it differs
      from the home domain). <cref>Can the ER server be located in a third
      domain (ex: broker's) according to ERP mechanism?</cref></t>

      <t>When the peer initiates an ERP exchange, the authenticator creates a
      Diameter-EAP-Request (DER) message <xref target="RFC4072"/>. The
      Application Id of the message is set to that of the Diameter ERP
      application <xref target="DAI"/> in the message. The generation of the
      ERP/DER message is detailed in <xref target="Re-authentication"/>.</t>

      <t>If there is an ER server in the same domain as the authenticator
      (i.e., the local domain), Diameter routing MUST be configured so that
      this ERP/DER message reaches that server, even if the Destination-Realm
      is not the same as local domain.</t>

      <t>If there is no local ER server, the message is routed according to
      its Destination-Realm AVP content, extracted from the realm component of
      the keyName-NAI attribute. As specified in RFC6696 <xref
      target="RFC6696"/>, this realm is the home domain of the peer in the
      case of bootstrapping exchange ('B' flag is set in ERP message) or the
      domain of the bootstrapped ER server otherwise <cref>This actually might
      allow the ER server to be in a third party realm</cref>.</t>

      <t>If no ER server is available in the home domain either, the ERP/DER
      message cannot be delivered, and an error DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_DELIVER
      MUST be generated as specified in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dime-rfc3588bis"/> and returned to the authenticator.
      The authenticator MAY cache this information (with limited duration) to
      avoid further attempts to execute ERP with this realm. It MAY also
      fallback to full EAP authentication to authenticate the peer.</t>

      <t>When an ER server receives the ERP/DER message, it searches its local
      database for a valid, unexpired root key <cref>and authorization state
      ?</cref> matching the keyName part of the User-Name AVP. If such key is
      found, the ER server processes the ERP message as described in <xref
      target="RFC6696"/> then creates the ERP/DEA answer as described in <xref
      target="Re-authentication"/>. The rMSK is included in this answer.</t>

      <t>Finally, the authenticator extracts the rMSK from the ERP/DEA as
      described in RFC6696 <xref target="RFC6696"/>, and forwards the content
      of the EAP-Payload AVP, the EAP-Finish/Re-Auth message, to the peer.</t>

      <t>The ER server may or may not possess the root key in its local
      database. If the EAP-Initiate/Re-Auth message has its 'B' flag set
      (Bootstrapping exchange) and the ER server possesses the root key, the
      ER server SHOULD respond directly to the peer that initiated the ERP
      exchange. Otherwise, the ER server SHOULD act as a proxy and forward the
      message to the home EAP server after changing its Application Id to
      Diameter EAP and adding the ERP-RK-Request AVP to request the root key.
      See <xref target="Bootstrapping"/> for more detail on this process.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Bootstrapping" title="Bootstrapping the ER Server">
      <t>The bootstrapping process involves the home EAP server and the ER
      server, but also impacts the peer and the authenticator. In ERP, the
      peer must derive the same keying material as the ER server. To achieve
      this, it must learn the domain name of the ER server. How this
      information is acquired is outside the scope of this specification, but
      the authenticator might be configured to advertize this domain name,
      especially in the case of re-authentication after a handover.</t>

      <t>The bootstrapping of an ER server with a given root key happens
      either during the initial EAP authentication of the peer when the EMSK
      -- from which the root key is derived -- is created, during the first
      re-authentication, or sometime between those events. We only consider
      the first two possibilities in this specification, in the following
      sub-sections.</t>

      <section anchor="ImplicitBS"
               title="Bootstrapping During the Initial EAP authentication ">
        <t>Bootstrapping the ER server during the initial EAP authentication
        (also known as implicit bootstrapping) offers the advantage that the
        server is immediately available for re-authentication of the peer,
        thus minimizing the re-authentication delay. On the other hand, it is
        possible that only a small number of peers will use re-authentication
        in the visited domain. Deriving and caching key material for all the
        peers (for example, for the peers that do not support ERP) is a waste
        of resources and should be avoided.</t>

        <t>To achieve implicit bootstrapping, the ER server acts as a Diameter
        EAP Proxy , and Diameter routing MUST be configured so that Diameter
        EAP application messages are routed through this proxy. The figure
        bellow illustrates this mechanism.</t>

        <t>The authenticator creates the first DER of the full EAP
        authentication and sends it to the ER server. The ER server proxies
        the first DER of the full EAP authentication and adds the
        ERP-RK-Request AVP inside, then forwards the request to the home EAP
        server.</t>

        <t>If the home Diameter server does not support the Diameter ERP
        extensions, it simply ignores the ERP-RK-Request AVP and continues as
        specified in RFC 4072 <xref target="RFC4072"/>. If the server supports
        the ERP extensions, it saves the value of the ERP-Realm AVP found
        inside the ERP-RK-Request AVP, and continues with the EAP
        authentication. When the authentication completes, if it is successful
        and the EAP method has generated an EMSK, the server MUST derive the
        rRK as specified in RFC 6696 <xref target="RFC6696"/>, using the saved
        domain name. It then includes the rRK inside a Key AVP (<xref
        target="KAVP"/>) with the Key-Type AVP set to rRK, before sending the
        DEA as usual.</t>

        <t>When the ER server proxies a Diameter-EAP-Answer message with a
        Session-Id corresponding to a message to which it added an ERP-RK-
        Request AVP, and the Result-Code is DIAMETER_SUCCESS, it MUST examine
        the message and save and remove any Key AVP (<xref target="KAVP"/>)
        with Key-Type AVP set to rRK. If the message does not contain such Key
        AVP, the ER server may cache the information that ERP is not possible
        for this session to avoid possible subsequent attempts. In any case,
        the information stored in ER server concerning a session should not
        have a lifetime greater than the EMSK for this session. <cref>how does
        the ER server knows the EMSK lifetime, if there is no ERP-RK-Answer?
        What is the lifetime of the MSK for example?</cref></t>

        <t>If the ER server is successfully bootstrapped, it should also add
        the ERP-Realm AVP after removing the Key AVP with Key-Type of rRK in
        the EAP/DEA message. This ERP-Realm information can be used by the
        authenticator to notify the peer that ER server is bootstrapped, and
        for which domain. How this information can be transmitted to the peer
        is outside the scope of this document. This information needs to be
        sent to the peer if both implicit and explicit bootstrapping
        mechanisms are possible, because the ERP message and the root key used
        for protecting this message are different in bootstrapping exchanges
        and non-bootstrapping exchanges.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Bootstrapping During the First Re-authentication">
        <t>Bootstrapping the ER server during the first re-authentication
        (also known as explicit bootstrapping) is only needed when there is no
        local ER server in the visited domain and there is an ER server in the
        home domain. It is less resource-intensive, since the EMSK generated
        during initial EAP authentication is reused to derive root keys. On
        the other hand, the first re-authentication requires a one-round-trip
        exchange with the home EAP server, since the EMSK is generated during
        the initial EAP authentication and never leaves the home EAP server,
        which is less efficient than the implicit bootstrapping scenario.</t>

        <t>The EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message is sent to the home ER server. The
        home ER server receives the ERP/DER message containing the EAP-
        Initiate/Re-Auth message with the 'B' flag set. It creates the new
        EAP/DER message using the received DRP/DER message and performs the
        following processing: <list>
            <t>Set the Application Id in the header of the message to
            &lt;Diameter EAP Application&gt; <xref target="RFC4072"/></t>

            <t>Extract the ERP-RK-Request AVP from the ERP/DER message, which
            contains the name of the domain where the ER server is located and
            add it to the newly created ERP/DER message.</t>
          </list>Then the newly created EAP/DER is sent and routed to the home
        Diameter EAP application server.</t>

        <t>
          If the home Diameter EAP server does not support ERP extensions,
          EAP packets with an unknown ERP-specific code (EAP-Initiate) will not
          be understood. In such a case, the home Diameter EAP server MUST send an
          EAP/DEA with a Result-Code indicating a Permanent Failure (for
          example, DIAMETER_ERROR_EAP_CODE_UNKNOWN or DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY).
          The Failed-AVP AVP MUST be included and contain a copy of the EAP-Payload
          AVP. Otherwise, it processes the DSRK request as described in <xref
          target="RFC6696"/>. In particular, it includes the Domain- Name TLV
          attribute with the content from the ERP-Realm AVP. The server creates
          the EAP/DEA reply message <xref target="RFC4072"/> including an
          instance of the Key AVP (<xref target="KAVP"/>) with Key-Type AVP set
          to rRK and an instance of the Domain-Name TLV attribute with the
          content from the ERP-Realm AVP.
        </t>

        <t>The ER server receives this EAP/DEA and proxies it as follows, in
        addition to standard proxy operations: <list>
            <t>Set the Application Id back to Diameter ERP Application Id
            (<xref target="DAI"/> <cref>TBD IANA</cref>)</t>

            <t>Extract and cache the content of the Key AVP with Key-Type set
            to rRK, as described in the implicit scenario (<xref
            target="ImplicitBS"/>).<cref>And authorization AVPs ?</cref></t>
          </list> The ERP/DEA message is then forwarded to the authenticator,
        that can use the rMSK as described in RFC 6696 <xref

      <t>The peer sends an EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message to the ER server via
      the authenticator. Alternatively, the authenticator may send an EAP-
      Initiate/Re-auth-Start message to the peer to trigger the mechanism. In
      this case, the peer responds with an EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message.</t>

      <t>If the authenticator does not support ERP (pure Diameter EAP <xref
      target="RFC4072"/> support), it discards the EAP packets with an unknown
      ERP-specific code (EAP-Initiate). The peer should fallback to full EAP
      authentication in this case.</t>

      <t>When the authenticator receives an EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message from
      the peer, the message is processed as described in <xref
      target="RFC6696"/> with regard to the EAP state machine. It creates a
      Diameter ERP/DER message following the general process of <xref
      target="RFC4072"> Diameter EAP</xref>, with the following
      differences:<list>
          <t>The Application Id in the header is set to &lt;Diameter ERP&gt;
          (code TBD <cref>TBD IANA</cref>).</t>

          <t>The value in Auth-Application-Id AVP is also set to &lt;Diameter
          ERP&gt;.</t>

          <t>The keyName-NAI attribute from the ERP message is used to create
          the content of the User-Name and Destination-Realm AVPs. <cref>FFS:
          What about Session-ID AVP -- in case of re-auth at the same place,
          and in case of handover?</cref></t>

          <t>The Auth-Request-Type AVP content is set to the appropriate
          value.</t>

          <t>The EAP-Payload AVP contains the EAP-Initiate/Re-Auth
          meassge.</t>
        </list>Then this ERP/DER message is sent as described in <xref
      target="Overview"/>.</t>

      <t>The ER server receives and processes this request as described in
      <xref target="Overview"/>. It then creates an ERP/DEA message following
      the general process described in RFC4072 <xref target="RFC4072"/>, with
      the following differences:<list>
          <t>The Application Id in the header is set to &lt;Diameter ERP&gt;
          (code TBD).</t>

          <t>The value of the Auth-Application-Id AVP is also set to
          &lt;Diameter ERP&gt;.</t>

          <t>The EAP-Payload AVP contains the EAP-Finish/Re-auth message.</t>

          <t>If authentication is successful, an instance of the Key AVP
          containing the Re-authentication Master Session Key (rMSK) derived
          by ERP is included.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>When the authenticator receives this ERP/DEA answer, it processes it
      as described in Diameter EAP <xref target="RFC4072"/> and RFC 6696 <xref
      target="RFC6696"/>: the content of the EAP-Payload AVP is forwarded to
      the peer, and the contents of the Keying-Material AVP <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dime-local-keytran"/> is used as a shared secret for a
      secure association protocol specific to the lower-layer in use.</t>
