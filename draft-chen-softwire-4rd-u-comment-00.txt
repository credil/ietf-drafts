Internet-Draft        4rd-U Architectural Comments            April 2012


1.  Introduction

   The 4rd-U [I-D.despres-softwire-4rd-u] is proposed with the goal of
   unifying encapsulation and double translation into a single standard.
   That effort identifies its technical objective to realize the full
   transparency as in encapsultion and meanwhile the visibility of L4
   protocol data unit (PDU) as in double translation.  The designers of
   4rd-U expect it plays the role of a replacement of the MAP suites,
   including MAP [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port], MAP-E
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-map-encapsulation], MAP-T
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-map-translation] and the DHCP option for MAP
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-map-dhcp-option].  Throughout this document, the
   term "MAP", unless explicitly specified, refers to the suite of MAP
   documents, as an entire description of the MAP architecture.

   This commentary is purposed in sharing the observation on 4rd-U
   proposal.  It covers part of the 4rd-U principles, focusing on its
   major semantics changes, especially those that possibly impact the
   architecture of the Internet and its transition.  The commentary
   itself doesn't conclude if 4rd-U is or isn't a deployable
   architecture for transition.  It provides information for those who
   would like to do such a judgement.  The commentry can be referenced
   by 1) implementors/testers of 4rd-U to cover the architectural
   concerns when they set the test scenarios; 2) operators to evaluate
   if 4rd-U is a safe choice fitting their own networking environment
   and practice experiences; 3) the community of the Internet
   engineering to evaluate 4rd-U technology.

   This commentary sticks to the newest, currectly version -06, of the
   4rd-U draft.  Unless explicitly specified, the discussion doesn't
   cover the feasures once involved into the 4rd-U early versions but
   now already deprecated or obsolteted by other mechanisms.

   This commentary covers only topics that the author(s) have
   investigated.  Co-authorship is welcome and input of further
   investigations is expected.

Internet-Draft        4rd-U Architectural Comments            April 2012


4.  4rd-U Overview

   4rd-U draft contains a lot of features overlapping the problems that
   MAP also having addressed.  The following analysis on 4rd-U
   motivations, major technical objectives and exclusive solutions is
   based on the understanding of the commentary author(s) through
   reading 4rd-U drafts, comparing 4rd-U and MAP suites, and discussing
   with the 4rd-U designers.

4.1.  General motivations

   Generally, 4rd-U is motivated with the purposes of

   (M1)  unification of encapsulation and double translation for IPv4
         residual deployment;

   (M2)  simplification of L4 protocol treatment;

   (M3)  simplification of address distinguishment in the environment
         where there are also native IPv6 communications.

4.2.  Technical problems to solve

   Trying to solve the following problems makes 4rd-U different from
   MAP.

   (O1)  DF=1/MF=1 transparency: [RFC6145], whose header processing of
         translation is applied in MAP-T, doesn't cover the case where
         IPv4 packet with both "Don't Fragment" (DF) and "More Fragment"
         (MF) flags set.  MAP-T points out that this corner case is very
         minor and some literature (e.g., [IMC07]) argues such a case is
         considered abnormal regarding IPv4 protocol [RFC0791], followed
         by statistics on this abnormaly. 4rd-U argues it should be
         supported no matter how minor it is observed in practice.

   (O2)  ToS transparency: DiffServ architecture ([RFC2475]) points out
         that, (regarding the IPSec tunnel consideration,) whether DSCP
         change in tunneling domain should be visible to the tunneled
         protocol or not, depends upon the role of "tunnel" in the
         architectural perspective.  MAP-E follows [RFC2473] and keeps
         it as unchanged.  MAP-T follows [RFC6145] and copies the IPv4
         ToS into IPv6 TrafficClass and vice versa. 4rd-U argues ToS
         should be kept unchanged when the packet traverses the IPv6
         domain, except the ECN bits.

Internet-Draft        4rd-U Architectural Comments            April 2012


   (O3)  IPv6 O&A tools fully functioning: when IPv4 packet is
         encapsulated, IPv4 protocol details is hidden and existing IPv6
         O&A tools are unable to view these hidden details, and
         accordingly functions like filtering is not able to be
         performed. 4rd-U argues this "drawback" of MAP-E should and
         could be overcome without losing the full transparency of
         encapsulation.

   (O4)  Deep L4 inspection: when IPv4 packet is encapsulated with IPv6,
         typically middle boxes in the IPv6 domain doesn't have the
         functionality of deep inspection on the Layer-4 protocol data
         unit (PDU) in the encapsulated packet.  This makes MAP-E
         traffic is unable to be filtered with the existing IPv6 L4
         filter rules . 4rd-U argues this "drawback" of MAP-E should and
         could be overcome without losing the full transparency of
         encapsulation.

   (O5)  Checksum transparency: MAP-T, along with [RFC6145], adjust L4
         protocol checksum at the translator. 4rd-U argues [RFC6145]
         optionally supporting DCCP checksum adjustment may cause wrong
         checksum for receiver of MAP-T if IPv4-to-IPv6 translator does
         the adjustment while the IPv6-to-IPv4 one doesn't.  It also
         argues checksum validity should be ensured through address in
         order to simplify L4 processing.

4.3.  Technical means of the solution

   In order to achieve the goal of (M1) and to solve the problems listed
   above, 4rd-U proposes a series of technical means.  Essentially, a
   "reversible header mapping" is defined through these means, having
   IPv4 header fields (except options) reserved but the header is not
   embedded as a whole.  This is to achieve the support for deep L4
   inspection as translation can, meanwhile to keep the IPv4 header
   information unchanged the IPv6 domain.  In details, these means
   include:

   (T1)  Always-on fragment header: as a container preserving not only
         the fragmentation-related information but also some other
         fields.

   (T2)  DF preserver: at the leftmost bit of IPv6 packet identification
         field of the fragment header, carrying the original IPv4
         packet's DF bit.

   (T3)  ToS preserver: at the bits 8~15 of IPv6 packet identification
         field of the fragment header, carrying the original value of
         IPv4 packet's ToS field.

Internet-Draft        4rd-U Architectural Comments            April 2012


   (T4)  TTL preservers: TTL first bit preserved at the leftmost bit of
         IPv6 HopLimit; TTL bits 1~7 preserved at bit 1~7 of IPv6 packet
         identification field of the fragment header.

   (T5)  ICMPv4 being carried by IPv6: providing full transparency for
         ICMPv4 messages traversing the IPv6 domain; also as a required
         solution to deal with the problem that [RFC6145] has identified
         regarding the PTB message with MTU less than 1280 bytes
         (translated), and meanwhile keep the DF=1 transparent.

   (T6)  ICMPv6 being translated: with the same logic that [RFC6145]
         defines for the ICMPv6 error messages generated by the middle
         boxes in the IPv6 domain.

   4rd-U also defines techinal means for (M2) and (M3), respectively.

   Checksum neutrality preserver (CNP):  in the end of IPv6 interface
         identifier, with the value ensuring the mapped IPv6 address
         having the same checksum with the original IPv4 address.

   V-octet:  as a mark for 4rd-U address, (0x03 for bits 64~71) in IPv6
         address generated by the 4rd-U CE or BR, as a means
         distinguishing 4rd-U traffic from native usage.

   The current version of this commentary focuses on the architecture
   issue and therefore motivation (M1), technical objectives (O1)~(O5),
   and technical means (T1) through (T6) are in scope.

5.  Semantic Changes of 4rd-U and Potential Impacts

   The above technical means more or less change the well-known Internet
   protocol semantics.  It is not the task of this commentary to judge
   if these changes are serious concerns or not.  It is the task of it
   to identify what kind of semantic changes they are and to identify
   what potential impacts they have.

   Sometimes MAP-E or MAP-T semantics is also clarified when the
   clarification is considered helpful to share understanding.  In the
   term of header processing semantics, MAP-E is based on [RFC2473]
   while MAP-T on [RFC6145].

5.1.  Semantics: existence of fragment header

   IPv6 semantics:
         Indicating the source has fragmented the datagram.

   RFC6145 semantics:
         Indicating the source allows further fragmentation, informing
         the IPv6-to-IPv4 translator clear the DF when making the IPv4
         packet.

   4rd-U semantics:
         Indicating nothing specific to fragmentation facts, but always
         being included.

   Impact:
         Always seeing fragment header is strange to middle boxes in the
         IPv6 domain.  The system administrators of any middle box
         SHOULD be informed on the deployment of 4rd-U.

5.2.  Semantics: IPv6 packet identification

   IPv6 semantics:
         32-bit packet identification.

   RFC6145 semantics:
         32-bit packet identification with, if translated from IPv4,
         having the original IPv4 packet identification in lower 16 bits
         while keeping the higher 16 bits zero.

   4rd-U semantics:
         If translated from IPv4, having the original IPv4 packet
         identification in lower 16 bits while original DF in the
         highest bit, TTL in the bits 1~7, DSCP in bits 8~13, ECN in
         bits 14~15.

Internet-Draft        4rd-U Architectural Comments            April 2012


   Impact:

         a.    Single translation, which is supported by RFC6145,
               becomes incompatible in 4rd-U as the 32-bit full IPv6
               identification cannot be distinguished (workaround:
               V-octet may help the distinguishment with need of
               verification.)

         b.    Session identification in middlex boxes (firewalls) is
               confused because the same IPv4 datagrams might be
               fragmented into packets and their value of TTL and ECN
               may become different when entering the IPv6 domain,
               causing different identification in IPv6.  Therefore the
               technical objective (O3) is not fully reached.

5.3.  Semantics: Hop Limit of IPv6

   IPv6 semantics:
         One decrement per hop.  In practice (e.g., some hop-security
         mechanisms, like that is designed in RIPng ([RFC2080]), the
         generic TTL-security ([RFC5082]), which is used in both OSPFv3
         and BGP4+ products), Hop Limit is initialized to 255 and
         receivers calculates the hop-distance from the source.

   RFC2473 semantics:
         Tunnel entry point initializes HopLimit to 255 in IPv6.  Hop
         Limit reaching 0 indicates that tunnel exit point is
         unreachable due to, e.g., routing problems (count-to-infinity),
         treated as an link failure.  Therefore the "hop limit exceeded"
         ICMPv6 error message generated in IPv6 domain is translated to
         "host unreachable".

   RFC6145 semantics:
         Tunnel entry point copies TTL to Hop Limit in IPv6.  Hop Limit
         decrement in IPv6 domain is reflected to IPv4 TTL when packet
         is translated back to IPv4, treated as multi-hop paticipant in
         the end-to-end delivery path.  Therefore the "hop limit
         exceeded" ICMPv6 error message generated in IPv6 domain is
         translated to "time to live exceeded in transit".

   4rd-U semantics:
         The leftmost bit of IPv4 TTL is copied to the leftmost bit of
         Hop Limit field, while the bit 1~7 of Hop Limit is initialized
         to 127. 4rd-U translates ICMPv6 "hop limit exceeded" message,
         generated in the IPv6 domain, to "time to live exceeded" ICMPv4
         message.

Internet-Draft        4rd-U Architectural Comments            April 2012


   Impact:

         a.    The behavior of 4rd-U translation of "hop limit exceeded"
               is contradictory to the behavior that IPv4 TTL is not
               changed through the IPv6 domain.

         b.    The IPv6 domain maximum hop count must be limited below
               127. (4rd-U draft considers it is not a problem in
               practice.)

         c.    The criterion of IPv6 routing "count-to-infinity" is
               changed.  Even if the diameter of the IPv6 domain is
               surely less than 127, considering the temporary route
               loop often happens in dynamic routing, limiting hop below
               127 is actually setting an allowed diameter far less than
               this value.

         d.    IPv6 normal usage of Hop Limit larger than 127 is
               confused.  Impact involves the TTL-security mechanism for
               IPv6 routing, application-layer hop count constraints,
               etc.  Host behind 4rd-U CE may generate attack packets
               breaking the IPv6 TTL-security mechanism, through
               spoofing CE's source address and applying any TTL value
               with leftmost bit set.  Wheter other mechanism of 4rd-U
               (like V-octet) provides sufficient means of protection
               needs to be further investigated and verified.

5.4.  Semantics: IP/ICMP relationship

   IPv4/v6 semantics:
         ICMP is considered a companion of IP rather than a L4 protocol.
         IPv4 [RFC0791] carries ICMPv4 [RFC0792] and served by ICMPv4;
         IPv6 [RFC2460] carries ICMPv6 [RFC4443] and served by ICMPv6.
         IPv4 address integrity is protected by IPv4 header checksum;
         IPv6 address integrity is protected by ICMPv6 checksum, which
         covers IPv6 pseudo-header.

   RFC2473 semantics:
         ICMPv4 is carried by IPv4 and the entire IPv4 PDU is
         encapsulated by IPv6.  The tunneled protocol contains header
         checksum.  As a tunnel link, the check on the tunneled protocol
         is never supposed to be performed in the middle of the link but
         only the tunnel end points.

   RFC6145 semantics:
         IPv4/ICMPv4 pair is translated to IPv6/ICMPv6 pair and vise
         versa.  Double translation may lose semantics accuracy for some
         IPv4 error messages in acceptable level.

Internet-Draft        4rd-U Architectural Comments            April 2012


   4rd-U semantics:
         IPv4/ICMPv4 pair is mapped to IPv6/ICMPv4 pair and vise versa;
         ICMPv6 generated in IPv6 domain (IPv6/ICMPv6 pair) is
         translated to IPv4/ICMPv4 pair, following the same way as
         RFC6145 does.

   Impact:

         a.    IPv6 domain MUST set all filters in middle boxes to pass
               protocol 1 (ICMP) as IPv6 payload in order to support
               4rd-U functionality.

         b.    The IPv6 O&A tools that ensure ICMP error message being
               destined to original source cannot function regarding
               ICMPv4 as payload.  This is not a mistake but doesn't
               satisfy the technical objective (O3).

         c.    In the IPv6/ICMPv4 pair, both IPv6 header and ICMPv4
               header doesn't contain checksum regarding addresses.
               Integrity protection is totally lost.

6.  On Tunnel as Architectural Building Block

   Because 4rd-U calls it self a "tunneling" solution, it is necessary
   to review the concept of "tunnel" and identify what kind of 4rd-U
   tunnel is in the term of architectural building block in the Internet
   transition.

   In the background section of "A Scheme for an Internet Encapsulation
   Protocol, Version 1" ([RFC1241]), it is stated:

      A tunnel is essentially a Source Route that circumvents
      conventional routing mechanisms.

   It is further pointed out that the ways of making a tunnel includes
   source routing option, new IP option, and IP encapsulation.
   [RFC2475], mentioning different view of architectural building block
   about "tunnel", also reflects such an understanding.  In this
   context, let's call it the tunnel of "general sense".  General-sense
   tunnel can be a one-hop virtual link or a multi-hop participant in
   the delivery path.

   On the other hand, the community has widely accepted "tunnel", unless
   it is explicitly specified, as a conventional alias of the building
   block provided by the technology of encapsulation.  Let's call that
   tunnel of "narrow sense".  Narrow-sense tunnel, in architecture,
   behaves as a one-hop virtual link.

   With the understanding of "circumventing conventional routing
   mechanism", surely double translation is also a sort of tunneling in
   general sense, but behaves as the building block of multi-hop
   participant.

   4rd-U is surely a sort of general-sense tunneling technology.
   However, when one claims 4rd-U having the advantages of tunnel in
   comparison to translation approaches, the wording is obviously
   talking about the narrow-sense tunneling.  It needs further
   investigation to ensure if 4rd-U is qualified to be called as a
   tunnel in the narrow sense.

7.  Summary

   The observation is, 4rd-U introduces 3 types of behaviors:

   Similar to encapsulation:

         -  IPv4 fields DF, ToS, TTL are kept unchanged, traversing the
            IPv6 domain.

         -  Middle boxes in the tunnel are unable to check if ICMPv4
            message is sent to correct destination.

   Similar to double translation:

         -  Without protocol layering, position of IPv4 fields are
            changed;

         -  IPv4 options are removed;

         -  Translation ICMPv6 messages generated in IPv6 domain to
            ICMPv4 messages with the same logic of RFC6145.

   Never seen in encapsulation nor in double  translation:

         -  IPv6 carries ICMPv4 directly;

         -  TTL leftmost bit is copied to Hop Limit leftmost bit.

   When setting the testing scenarios, it is recommended that the above
   semantics changes and behaviors are fully considered.  It is also
   expected that the designer, implementator and tester provides
   comprehensive evidence either to ensure those changes as well as new
   behaviors are not of problem in practice or to clarify the boundary
   conditions, with which as prerequisites 4rd-U can work safely and
   reach its design objectives.
