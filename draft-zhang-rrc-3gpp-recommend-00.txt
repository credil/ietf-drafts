1.  Introduction

   RRC is an acronym of the radio resource control protocol, mainly
   responsible for the radio resource allocation and sending relevant
   signaling.  RRC connection[TR_21.905_3GPP] refers to a point-to-point
   bi-directional connection between RRC peer entities on the UE and the
   UTRAN sides, through which the control signaling between UE and UTRAN
   and some signaling of the NAS(Non Access Stratum ) are transfered.

   To access a 3G network, the user SHOULD establish a RRC connection
   with the accesse network and achieve mutual authentication with the
   core network. 3G network completes the user authentication tasks by

   the core network, but there is no mechanism in the RRC protocol to
   judge the legitimacy of the requesting subscriber, which means that
   any user who request to access the network will acquire a RRC
   connection.  If radio resources are occupied too much by the
   attacker, the normal operation of the network MUST be affected.  So,
   in this profile, a user identity verification scheme is proposed for
   the RRC agreement.

1.1.  Overview of the RRC Connection Establishment Process

   The main flow of RRC connection establishment[TS_25.331_3GPP] is
   showed as figure 1.

        Figure 1 The normal process of RRC connection establishment

   1) The MS(Mobile Station) sends a RRC request message RRC CONNECTION
   REQUEST to the RNC(radio network controller) via the uplink CCCH,
   requesting to establish a RRC connection.

   2) According to the establishment reason and the current resource
   situation, RNC determines whether to accept the connection request
   and to establish on a public channel or a dedicated channel.  If RNC
   has accepted the RRC connection request, he will allocate a radio
   network temporary identifier U-RNTI to MS.  After that, if he decides
   to establish the connection on a public channel, he will also
   allocate a cell radio network temporary identifier C-RNTI.
   Otherwise, RNC will send a radio link setup request message RADIO
   LINK SETUP REQUEST to the NodeB, and use the ALCAP protocol to
   establish the Iub interface for the user data transmission.

   3) RNC sends the connection establishment message RRC CONNECTION
   SETUP to the MS through a downlink CCCH channel, containing the
   information of channels assigned to the user.

   4) If the RRC connection has been established successfully, MS will
   send a RRC connection establishment complete message RRC CONNECTION
   SETUP COMPLETE to the RNC through the attributed channel and end the
   RRC connection establishment.

   It is worth noting that during the channel distribution process, the
   user can acquire the radio resource without identity verification.

2.  Design Goals

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated-Title                  July 2013


   In the RRC(radio resource control) connection establishment phase,
   upon receipt of a RRC connection request message, the RNC will decide
   whether to accept this request according to the request reason and
   the current resource situation, but won't consider whether the user
   is legal.  Once an adversary launches a connection request to the RNC
   with the intercepted request message, RNC will also allocate radio
   resources to him.  With a large amount of radio resources occupied by
   the attacker, the legal user MAY be refused by the network because of
   resource shortage.  In addition, the user authentication tasks are
   completed by the core network, which means that a large amount of
   bandwidth resources in the core network are consumed and various
   attacks are easy to be introduced into the core network.  The main
   goal of this profile are outlined below:

   1)To reduce radio resource consumption.

   The radio resource is distributed by the RNC to the user.  This
   profile proposed that in the RRC connection establishment phase, the
   user identity will be verified to avoid the radio resource being
   occupied by attackers.  If so, the system can reduce plenty of
   resources consumption.

   2)To prevent malious attacks.

   According to the 3gpp standard, various attacks can be resisted by
   the core network.  However, this scheme will cause a large amount of
   bandwidth resources being wasted.  The method proposed in this
   profile can avoid malious attacks being introduced into the core
   network.

3.  The Recommendation for the RRC Agreement

   This profile suggests that when the user launches a RRC connection
   request, he SHOULD submit a accessing network credential (ANI).
   Through judging the legitimacy of ANI and its resource situation, RNC
   decides whether to accept the connection request .

3.1.  Format of the ANI Credential

                   +----------------------------------+
                   |          Credential name         |
                   +----------------------------------+
                   |       Identification of HlR      |
                   +----------------------------------+
                   |     Digital signature of HLR     |
                   +----------------------------------+

                     Figure 2 Format of ANI credential

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated-Title                  July 2013


   The format of ANI credential is as figure 2 shows.  Each user has an
   ANI credential which is stored in the USIM card and the attributed
   HLR, consisting of three different attributes, that is, the
   credential name, the identification of attributed HLR and the digital
   signature of HLR.  The public key certificate of HLR is stored in
   USIM card, and HLR signs the credential name and the identification
   of attributed HLR with its privacy key.  When the user launches a RRC
   connection request to the RNC, his ANI credential and the HLR public
   key certificate are submitted.  The RNC can use the certificate to
   judge the ANI credential's legitimacy.

3.2.  Improved Process of RRC Connection Establishment

   According to whether or not the information of the accessed cell is
   stored in the USIM card, the RRC connection can be divided into two
   cases.  The discussions about the improved method are as follow:

   (1) when no information about the accessed cell is stored in USIM
   card, the process is as figure 3 shows.

       Figure 3 The process of initial RRC connection establishment

   1) The MS sends a initial RRC connection request message to RNC: RRC
   CONNECTION REQUEST[PKChlr, E(Kur,ANI||CGI||RANDr)].

   Kur and RANDr are broadcast by RNC.  The RNC verifies the user
   identity by HLR's public key certificate PKChlr.  To prevent the
   replay of initial RRC connection request message, a timing updated
   parameter RANDr is used in this message.  ANI||CGI||RANDr SHOULD be
   encrypted with public key Kur to ensure that the ANI credential and
   RANDr won't be interpolated by attackers.

   2) When the RNC receives the RRC connection request message, the
   request message is decrypted by his private key and is verified.

   First, we SHOULD judge whether or not the initial RRC connection
   request message is replayed.  So, the RNC will inquire the maintained
   random number record(RANDlast,RANDnow), RANDlast refers to the last
   random number broadcast by RNC, and RANDnow refers to the random
   number broadcast currently.  If RANDr=RANDnew, we can define that
   this message is not replayed.  But because of the transmission delay
   between MS and RNC, the broadcasted random number MAY have been
   updated before the request message arrives RNC.  The RNC will define
   that this request message is replayed and refuse the connection
   request because RANDr and RANDnow is not equal.  In this profile, if
   RANDr =RANDlast, but the interval is very short between present
   moment and the update time, we SHOULD still define this RRC
   connection request message is not replayed.

   Next, RNC judges the correctness of the ANI credential.  The RNC can
   verify the digital signature with the public key certificate PKChlr,
   and determine whether the network credential is correct or not.

   Finally, the RNC will compare the CGI with the connected cell
   Identifier.  If they match, the RNC considers that the RRC connection
   request message is legal, never being modified and redirected.
   Otherwise, the RNC considers the connection request is illegal and
   reject it.

   3) According to the resource situation and the request reason, the
   RNC determines whether to allocate radio resources to the user and
   which kind of channel to allocate, dedicated channel or public
   channel.

   If the RNC accepts the connection request, he will allocate radio
   resources to the user and set all the parameters.  Then RNC will
   assign a temporary accessing network credential TANI and a random
   number RANDm to the user.  When MS access this cell again, TANI will
   be used to represent the user identity, and RANDm will be used to
   avoid the replay of initial RRC connection request message.

           Figure 4 Forms of maintained record set by MS and RNC

   As figure 4, MS and RNC maintain Form1 and Form2 respectively.

   Form1 includes three attributes, that is, Cell Global Identifier CGI,
   random number RANDr and the TANI credential, which are used to store
   the random number and the TANI credential corresponding to a cell.
   Form2 includes four attributes, that is, credential name of ANI, Cell
   Global Identifier CGI, random number RANDm and the TANI credential,
   which are used to store the random number and the TANI credential
   distributed to each user by RNC.

   Each record in the Form1 and Form2 has a certain life time.  If no
   update occurs during a stipulated time, the corresponding record will
   be deleted.  To avoid producing two same initial RRC connection
   request during the update interval of RANDr, the hold time of each
   record in Form1 and Form2 SHOULD be much longer than the updating
   interval of RANDr.

   After the RNC completes the allocation of TANI and RANDm, he will
   perform logical operation: TANI xor hash(ANI||CGI||RANDr).  Then, the
   RNC sends the RRC CONNECTION SETUP message to MS with the random
   number RANDm, the information of allocated radio resources and TANI
   xor hash(ANI||CGI||RANDr).

   4) After MS receives a response message of RRC connection
   establishment, calculating that:

   TANI=(TANI xor hash(ANI||CGI||RANDr) ) xor hash(ANI||CGI||RANDr)

   When MS receives the random number RANDm, he will inquire the Form1
   to define if there is the record about this cell.  If none, we SHOULD
   build a new record.  Otherwise we SHOULD find the corresponding
   record and update it.  Then the MS sends RRC CONNECTION SETUP
   COMPLETE message to the RNC, confirming the completion of RRC
   connection establishment.

   5) When the RNC receives the RRC connection establishment complete
   message, he will update the record in Form2 immediately.

   (2) if some information about the accessed cell is stored in USIM
   card, the process is as figure 5 shows.

   1) The MS sends a RRC connection request message to the RNC: RRC
   CONNECTION REQUEST(TANI,f10(ANI credential name, RANDm,CGI)ms).

   The MS inquires the Form1 and extracts the corresponding random
   number RANDm.  Then the MS computers the authentication data block
   f10(ANI credential name,RANDm,CGI)ms with the one-way function f10.

   2) Upon receipt of the RRC connection request message, the RNC judges
   the legitimacy of this request message.

   First, the RNC inquires Form2 corresponding to TANI and computers the
   authentication block of RNC with f10.  Then he will compares the
   received f10(ANI credential name,RANDm ,CGI)ms with f10(ANI
   credential name,RANDm ,CGI)rnc, if they match the RNC considers the
   RRC connection request message to be legal and is produced in real
   time, never being modified or redirected.  Otherwise the RNC will
   consider the request to be illegal.

   3) According to the resource situation and the request reason, the
   RNC determines whether to allocate radio resources to the user and
   which kind of channel to allocate, dedicated channel or public
   channel.

   Upon receipt of the connection request, the RNC allocates radio
   resources and a new random number RANDm to the legal user.  Then he
   will send the RRC CONNECTION SETUP message to the MS with the RANDm
   and the information of the allocated radio resources.

   4) Upon receipt of the RRC connection establishment message, the MS
   updates the record in Form1.  Then the MS sends RRC CONNECTION SETUP
   COMPLETE message to the RNC, confirming the completion of the RRC
   connection establishment.

   5) Upon receipt of the RRC connection establishment complete message,
   the MS updates the record in Form2.

4.  Security Considerations

   Considering the security performance, in this profile, the improved
   RRC agreement can prevent malicious attack effectively.  The specific
   analyses are as follow:

   (1) Resistance to replay attack

   In this profile, MS and RNC maintain a random number RANDm, and a new
   random number will be distributed to the user by RNC after a
   successful RRC connection.  The MS extracts the random number from
   Form1 when launches a connection request, and RNC will decide whether

   the RRC connection request is replayed through the judgment of
   equation f10(ANI credential name,RANDm ,CGI)ms= f10(ANI credential
   name,RANDm,CGI)rnc.

   Moreover, there is a parameter RANDr in the initial RRC connection
   request message, which is broadcast by the RNC and updated in real
   time to ensure the difference of every initial RRC connection request
   message.

   (2) Resistance to the man-in-the-middle attack

   In this paper, the RRC connection request message contains a CGI.  If
   a disguised base station serves as a middleman, the CGI in
   E(Kur,ANI||CGI||RANDr) or f10(ANI credential name,RANDm,CGI)ms will
   be different from the CGI which the RNC connects to.  Once the RNC
   detects the attack, he will immediately refuse the connection
   request.

   (3)Resistance to the redirection attack

   If the attacker leads the user data into a network which do not
   provide encryption protection or the encryption strength is weak, the
   attack can easily intercept the user data and may also bring a
   charging attack on the user at the same time.  In this profile, the
   resistance against this kind of attack is also through the CGI.  Once
   the attacker use a disguised base station to redirect the user data,
   the RNC of foreign serving network will also judge the RRC connection
   request message.  So,different CGI in the authentication data block
   will makes the network refuse the connection request.

   (4) Resistance to the Dos attack

   Previously researchers think that for UMTS network, DoS attack mainly
   consumes the resources in the core network, so some schemes focus on
   useing AKA agreement in the core network to prevent the DoS attack.
   These schemes ignore that when a DoS attack occurs, the attacker has
   occupied a large number of radio resources, which may lead the legal
   user not to get service normally.  In this profile, we suggest that
   the identification the MS SHOULD be verified in the RRC connection
   establishment phase.  The RRC connection is only for legal users.
   Therefore, attacker cannot launch the DoS attack through transmitting
   NAS information to the core network.

5.  Resource Considerations

   Comparing with the 3gpp standard, in this profile, the improved RRC
   agreement increases slightly the bandwidth resource consumption in
   access layer.  However, the scheme provides the judgment on user
   identity in the access layer, which avoids providing radio resources
   to illegal users and saves the bandwidth resources in core network.
