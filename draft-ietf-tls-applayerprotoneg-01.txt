 Transport Layer Security (TLS) Application Layer Protocol Negotiation
                               Extension
                   draft-ietf-tls-applayerprotoneg-01

Abstract

   This document describes a Transport Layer Security (TLS) extension
   for application layer protocol negotiation within the TLS handshake.
   For instances in which the TLS connection is established over a well
   known TCP/IP port not associated with the desired application layer
   protocol, this extension allows the application layer to negotiate
   which protocol will be used within the TLS session.

1.  Introduction

   Increasingly, application layer protocols are encapsulated in the TLS
   security protocol [RFC5246].  This encapsulation enables applications
   to use the existing, secure communications links already present on
   port 443 across virtually the entire global IP infrastructure.

   When multiple application protocols are supported on a single server-
   side port number, such as port 443, the client and the server need to
   negotiate an application protocol for use with each connection.  It
   is desirable to accomplish this negotiation without adding network
   round-trips between the client and the server, as each round-trip
   will degrade an end-user's experience.  Further, it would be
   advantageous to allow certificate selection based on the negotiated
   application protocol.

   This document specifies a TLS extension which permits the application
   layer to negotiate protocol selection within the TLS handshake.  This
   work was requested by the HTTPbis WG to address the negotiation of
   HTTP version ([RFC2616], [I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2]) over TLS, however
   ALPN facilitates negotiation of arbitrary application layer
   protocols.

   With ALPN, the client sends the list of supported application
   protocols as part of the TLS ClientHello message.  The server chooses
   a protocol and sends the selected protocol as part of the TLS
   ServerHello message.  The application protocol negotiation can thus
   be accomplished within the TLS handshake, without adding network
   round-trips, and allows the server to associate a different
   certificate with each application protocol, if desired.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Application Layer Protocol Negotiation

3.1.  The Application Layer Protocol Negotiation Extension

   A new extension type ("application_layer_protocol_negotiation(16)")
   is defined and MAY be included by the client in its "ClientHello"
   message.

   enum {
       application_layer_protocol_negotiation(16), (65535)
   } ExtensionType;


   The "extension_data" field of the
   ("application_layer_protocol_negotiation(16)") extension SHALL
   contain a "ProtocolNameList" value.

   opaque ProtocolName<1..2^8-1>;

   struct {
       ProtocolName protocol_name_list<2..2^16-1>
   } ProtocolNameList;


   "ProtocolNameList" contains the list of protocols advertised by the
   client, in descending order of preference.  Protocols are named by
   IANA registered, opaque, non-empty byte strings, as described further
   in Section 6 "IANA Considerations" of this document.  Implementations
   MUST ensure that an empty string is not included and that no byte
   strings are truncated.

   Experimental protocol names, which are not registered by IANA, will
   start with the following sequence of bytes: 0x65, 0x78, 0x70 ("exp").

Internet-Draft   TLS App Layer Protocol Negotiation Ext       April 2013


   Servers that receive a client hello containing the
   "application_layer_protocol_negotiation" extension, MAY return a
   suitable protocol selection response to the client.  The server will
   ignore any protocol name that it does not recognize.  A new
   ServerHello extension type
   ("application_layer_protocol_negotiation(16)") MAY be returned to the
   client within the extended ServerHello message.  The "extension_data"
   field of the ("application_layer_protocol_negotiation(16)") extension
   SHALL be structured the same as described above for the client
   "extension_data", except that the "ProtocolNameList" MUST contain
   exactly one "ProtocolName".

   Therefore, a full handshake with the
   "application_layer_protocol_negotiation" extension in the ClientHello
   and ServerHello messages has the following flow (contrast with
   section 7.3 of [RFC5246]):

   Client                                              Server

   ClientHello                     -------->       ServerHello
     (ALPN extension &                               (ALPN extension &
      list of protocols)                              selected protocol)
                                                   Certificate*
                                                   ServerKeyExchange*
                                                   CertificateRequest*

                                   <--------       Finished
   Application Data                <------->       Application Data

                                 Figure 1

   An abbreviated handshake with the
   "application_layer_protocol_negotiation" extension has the following
   flow:

   Client                                              Server

   ClientHello                     -------->       ServerHello
     (ALPN extension &                               (ALPN extension &
      list of protocols)                              selected protocol)
                                                   [ChangeCipherSpec]
                                   <--------       Finished

   Finished                        -------->
   Application Data                <------->       Application Data

                                 Figure 2

   Unlike many other TLS extensions, this extension does not establish
   properties of the session, only of the connection.  When session
   resumption or session tickets [RFC5077] are used, the previous
   contents of this extension are irrelevant and only the values in the
   new handshake messages are considered.

3.2.  Protocol Selection

   It is expected that a server will have a list of protocols that it
   supports, in preference order, and will only select a protocol if the
   client supports it.  In that case, the server SHOULD select the most
   highly preferred protocol it supports which is also advertised by the
   client.  In the event that the server supports no protocols that the
   client advertises, then the server SHALL respond with a fatal
   "no_application_protocol" alert.

   enum {
       no_application_protocol(120),
       (255)
   } AlertDescription;


   The "no_application_protocol" fatal alert is only defined for the
   "application_layer_protocol_negotiation" extension and MUST NOT be
   sent unless the server has received a ClientHello message containing
   this extension.

   The protocol identified in the
   "application_layer_protocol_negotiation" extension type in the
   ServerHello SHALL be definitive for the connection.  The server SHALL
   NOT respond with a selected protocol and subsequently use a different
   protocol for application data exchange.

4.  Design Considerations

   The ALPN extension is intended to follow the typical design of TLS
   protocol extensions.  Specifically, the negotiation is performed
   entirely within the client/server hello exchange in accordance with
   established TLS architecture.  The
   "application_layer_protocol_negotiation" ServerHello extension is
   intended to be definitive for the connection and is sent in plaintext
   to permit network elements to provide differentiated service for the



Friedl, et al.          Expires October 27, 2013                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft   TLS App Layer Protocol Negotiation Ext       April 2013


   connection when the TCP/IP port number is not definitive for the
   application layer protocol to be used in the connection.  By placing
   ownership of protocol selection on the server, ALPN facilitates
   scenarios in which certificate selection or connection rerouting may
   be based on the negotiated protocol.

   Finally, by managing protocol selection in the clear as part of the
   handshake, ALPN avoids introducing false confidence with respect to
   the the ability to hide the negotiated protocol in advance of
   establishing the connection.  If hiding the protocol is required,
   then renegotiation after connection establishment, which would
   provide true TLS security guarantees, would be a preferred
   methodology.

   A namespace will be assigned for experimental protocols, comprising
   byte strings which start with the following sequence of bytes: 0x65,
   0x78, 0x70 ("exp").  Assignments in this namespace do not need IANA
   registration.

5.  Security Considerations

   The ALPN extension does not impact the security of TLS session
   establishment or application data exchange.  ALPN serves to provide
   an externally visible marker for the application layer protocol
   associated with the TLS connection.  Historically, the application
   layer protocol associated with a connection could be ascertained from
   the TCP/IP port number in use.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has updated its Registry of TLS ExtensionType Values to
   include the following entry:

   - 16 application_layer_protocol_negotiation

   This document also requires the IANA to create a registry of
   Application Layer Protocol Negotiation protocol byte strings,
   initially containing the following entries:

   - "http/1.1": HTTP/1.1 [RFC2616];

   - "http/2.0": HTTP/2.0 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2];

   - "spdy/1": (obsolete) SPDY version 1;

   - "spdy/2": SPDY version 2;

   - "spdy/3": SPDY version 3.

Internet-Draft   TLS App Layer Protocol Negotiation Ext       April 2013


   We propose that this new registry be created in a new page entitled:
   "Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs" beneath
   the existing heading of "Transport Layer Security (TLS)".
