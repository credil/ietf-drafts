    <abstract>
      <t>The Diameter protocol allows a Diameter redirect agent to specify
      one or more individual hosts to which a Diameter message may be
      redirected by an upstream Diameter node. However, in some
      circumstances an operator may wish to redirect messages to an
      alternate domain without specifying individual hosts. This document
      specifies a mechanism by which this can be achieved. New applications
      may incorporate this capability by reference to the present document.
      </t>
      
      <t>This memo updates Sections 6.13 and 6.14 of RFC6733 with respect
      to the usage of the Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time
      AVPs.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
<section title="Introduction">
    
  <t>The usual redirect indication, as described in Section 6.1.8 and
  Sections 6.12-6.14 of <xref target="RFC6733"/>, returns one or more
  individual host names to the upstream Diameter node. However, consider
  the case where an operator has offered a specific service but no
  longer wishes to do so. The operator has arranged for an alternative
  domain to provide the service. To aid in the transition to the new
  arrangement, the original operator maintains a redirect server to
  indicate the alternative destination to upstream nodes. However, the
  original operator has no interest in configuring a list of hosts in
  the alternative operator's domain, and would prefer simply to provide
  redirect indications to the domain as a whole.</t>

  <t>As an example of another use case, consider a 3GPP IMS deployment
  where subscriber data is provisioned in a geo-redundant Home
  Subscriber Server (HSS) cluster for reliability. Each Application
  Server (AS) needs to maintain redundant Diameter Sh links to both
  cluster nodes for scalability. It is preferable that the AS should go
  to the local HSS cluster node when it is available. It would be useful
  for a cluster node to be able to redirect an AS request to its partner
  node in the cluster without specifying the individual Sh link to that
  alternate node. This could be accomplished by identifying each cluster
  node with a separate realm and individual Sh links with separate
  servers, and redirecting on the basis of realm rather than individual
  server. There can be multiple geo-redundant HSS clusters, in which
  case the Subscriber Location Function (SLF) performs the redirection.
  </t>

  <t>Within this specification, the term "realm-based redirection" is
  used to refer to a mode of operation where the redirect indication
  specifies a realm and the upstream Diameter node reroutes the message
  to the realm rather than an individual host.</t>

  <section title="Requirements Language">
   
    <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
    target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

<section anchor="applic" title="Support of Realm-Based Redirection
                    Within Applications">

  <t>Because realm-based redirection is not part of base Diameter
  behaviour, support for realm-based redirection by the agent MUST be
  specified as part of particular applications. In this way, Diameter's
  capability negotiation mechanism can be used indirectly to indicate
  support for realm-based redirection by indicating support for the
  applications concerned. Designers of new applications can incorporate
  the mechanism specified here into their application by normative reference to
  this document. </t>

  <t>The result of making realm-based redirection an 
  application-specific behaviour is that it cannot be performed by a redirect
  agent, but instead must be performed by a Diameter server. However,
  despite the change in executing role, the behaviour itself is a slight 
  modification of the behaviour of a redirect agent as described in Section 
  2.8.3 of <xref target="RFC6733"/>.</t>
  
  <t>An application can specify that realm-based redirection operates
  only on the initial message of a session, or on any message of a
  session. In the former case, existing sessions will not be disrupted
  by the deployment of realm-based redirection. In the latter case,
  existing sessions will be disrupted if they are stateful.</t>

<section anchor="solution" title="Realm-Based Redirection">

  <t>This section specifies an extension to <xref target="RFC6733"/> to
  achieve realm-based redirection. The elements of this solution are:
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>a new result code, DIAMETER_REALM_REDIRECT_INDICATION (3xxx
    TBD);</t>

    <t>one new attribute-value pair (AVP), Redirect-Realm; and </t> 

    <t>associated behaviour at Diameter nodes implementing this
    specification. This behaviour includes the optional use of the 
    Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVPs. In this
    document, these AVPs apply to the peer discovered by a node acting on
    the server's response, an extension to their normal usage as described
    in Sections 6.13 and 6.14 of <xref target="RFC6733"/>.  </t>
  </list>
  </t>
  
  <t><xref target="proxy_behav"/> and <xref target="cli_behav"/>
  describe how a proxy or client may update its routing table for the
  application and initial realm, as a result of selecting a peer in the
  new realm. Note that as a result, the proxy or client will
  automatically route subsequent requests for that application to the
  new realm (with the possible exception of requests within sessions
  already established with the initial realm) until the cached routing
  entry expires. This should be borne in mind if the rerouting is
  intended to be temporary. </t>
  
  <section anchor="config" title="Configuration of the Redirecting Server">

    <t>A Diameter server MUST be configured as follows to execute realm-based
    redirection:
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>configured with an application that incorporates realm-based 
      redirection;</t>
      
      <t>the Local Action field of the routing table described in Section 2.7
      of <xref target="RFC6733"/> is set to LOCAL; </t>
      
      <t>an application-specific field is set to indicate that the required 
      local action is to perform realm-based redirection;</t>
      
      <t>an associated application-specific field is configured with the 
      identities of one or more realms to which the request should be
      redirected.</t>
    </list>
    </t>

  <section anchor="behav" title="Behaviour of Diameter Nodes">
  
    <section anchor="redAgent_behav" title="Behaviour at the Redirecting Server">
    
      <t>As mentioned in <xref target="applic"/>, an application
      incorporating realm-based redirection may specify that redirection
      applies for any request or only for the initial request of a session
      (i.e., to prevent disruption of established sessions). </t>

      <t>If a server configured as described in <xref target="config"/>
      receives a request to which realm-based redirection applies, the
      server MUST reply with an answer message with the 'E' bit set, while
      maintaining the Hop-by-Hop Identifier in the header. The server MUST
      include the Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER_REALM_REDIRECT_INDICATION.
      The server MUST also include the alternate realm identifier(s) with
      which it has been configured, each in a separate Redirect-Realm AVP
      instance.</t>
  
      <t>The server MAY include a copy of the Redirect-Host-Usage AVP, which
      SHOULD be set to REALM_AND_APPLICATION. If this AVP is added, the
      Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVP MUST also be included. Note that these
      AVPs apply to the peer discovered by a node acting on the server's
      response, as described in the next section. This is an extension of
      their normal usage as described by Sections 6.13 and 6.14 of 
      <xref target="RFC6733"/>. 
      <list style="empty">

      <t>A proxy conforming to this specification that receives an answer
      message with the Result-Code AVP set to
      DIAMETER_REALM_REDIRECT_INDICATION MAY attempt to reroute the original
      request to a server in a realm identified by a Redirect-Realm AVP
      instance in the answer message, or MAY simply forward the message to
      the upstream peer. If it chooses to reroute the request, it MUST take
      the following steps:
      <list style="numbers">
      
        <t>Select a specific realm from amongst those identified in instances
        of the Redirect-Realm AVP in the answer message.</t>

        <t>If successful, locate and establish a route to a peer in the
        realm given by the Redirect-Realm AVP, using normal discovery
        procedures as described in Section 5.2 of <xref target="RFC6733"/>.

          the answer.</t>

          <t>Remove the Destination-Host (if present) and Destination-Realm AVPs
          from the original request and add a new Destination-Realm AVP

        </list>
        </t>
        
        <t>If either of the preceding steps 2-3 fail and additional realms have
        been identified in the original answer, select another instance of the
        Redirect-Realm AVP in that answer and repeat steps 2-3 for the realm
        that it identifies.</t>

      some other result from a realm differing from the one to which it sent
      the original request. In the case where it receives
      DIAMETER_REALM_REDIRECT_INDICATION, the client SHOULD follow the same
