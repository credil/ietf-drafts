    <section title='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
      <t>A Uniform Resource Name (URN) <xref target='I-D.ietf-urnbis-rfc2141bis-urn'/> is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) <xref target='RFC3986'/> that is intended to serve as a persistent, location-independent resource identifier.  This document supplements the Uniform Resource Name (URN) syntax specification <xref target='I-D.ietf-urnbis-rfc2141bis-urn'/> by defining:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>The concept of a URN namespace.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>A mechanism for defining a URN namespace and associating it with a public identifier (called a Namespace ID or "NID").<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>Procedures for registering NIDs with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>Syntactically, the NID follows the 'urn' scheme name.  For instance, a URN in the 'example' namespace <xref target='RFC6963'/> might be of the form "urn:example:foo".</t>
      <t>This document rests on two key assumptions:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>
            Assignment of a URN is a managed process.
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            A string that conforms to the URN syntax is not necessarily a valid URN, because a URN needs to be assigned according to the rules of a particular namespace (in terms of syntax, semantics, and process).
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
          </t>
          <t>
            The space of URN namespaces is itself managed.
            <vspace blankLines='1'/>
            A string in the namespace identifier slot of the URN syntax is not necessarily a valid URN namespace identifier, because in order to be valid a namespace needs to be defined and registered in accordance with the rules of this document.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>URN namespaces were originally defined in <xref target='RFC2611'/>, which was obsoleted by <xref target='RFC3406'/>.  Based on experience with defining and registering URN namespaces since that time, this document specifies URN namespaces with the smallest reasonable set of changes from <xref target='RFC3406'/>, while at the same time simplifying the registration process.  This document obsoletes RFC 3406.</t>
    </section>

    <section title='Terminology' anchor='terms'>
      <t>Several important terms used in this document are defined in the URN syntax specification <xref target='I-D.ietf-urnbis-rfc2141bis-urn'/>.</t>
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target='RFC2119'/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title='What is a URN Namespace?' anchor='whatis'>
      <t>A URN namespace is a collection of identifiers that are (1) unique, (2) assigned in a consistent way, and (3) assigned according to a common definition.</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>The "uniqueness" constraint means that an identifier within the namespace is never assigned to more than one resource and never reassigned to a different resource.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>The "consistent assignment" constraint means that an identifier within the namespace is assigned by an organization or minted in accordance with a process or algorithm that is always followed.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>The "common definition" constraint means that there are clear definitions for the syntax of identifiers within the namespace and the process of assigning or minting them.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>A URN namespace is identified by a particular NID in order to ensure the global uniqueness of URNs and, optionally, to provide a cue regarding the structure of URNs assigned within a namespace.</t>
      <t>With regard to global uniqueness, using different NIDs for different collections of identifiers ensures that no two URNs will be the same for different resources, since each collection is required to uniquely assign each identifier.  However, a single resource can have more than one URN assigned to it for different purposes (e.g., some numbers might be valid identifiers in two different identifier systems, where the namespace identifier differentiates between the resulting URNs).</t>
      <t>With regard to the structure of URNs assigned within a namespace, the development of an identifier structure (and thereby a collection of identifiers) depends on the requirements of the community defining the identifiers, how the identifiers will be assigned and used, etc.  These issues are beyond the scope of URN syntax and the general rules for URN namespaces, because they are specific to the community defining a namespace (e.g., the bibliographic and publishing communities in the case of the 'ISBN' and 'ISSN' namespaces, or the developers of extensions to the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol in the case of the 'XMPP' namespace).</t>
      <t>URN namespaces inherit certain rights and responsibilities, e.g.:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>They uphold the general principles of a well-managed URN namespace by providing persistent identification of resources and unique assignment of identifier strings.</t>
          <t>They can be registered in global registration services.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title='URN Namespace Types' anchor='types'>

      <t>There are two types of URN namespace: formal and informal.  These are distinguished by the expected level of service, the information needed to define the namespace, and the procedures for registration.  Because the majority of the namespaces registered so far have been formal, this document concentrates on formal namespaces.</t>
      <t>Note: <xref target='RFC3406'/> defined a third type of "experimental namespaces", denoted by prefixing the namespace identifier with the string "X-".  Consistent with <xref target='RFC6648'/>, this specification removes the experimental category.</t>

      <section title='Formal Namespaces' anchor='types-formal'>
        <t>A formal namespace provides benefit to some subset of users on the Internet (i.e., not limited to users in communities or networks not connected to the Internet).  For example, it would be inappropriate for a NID to effectively force someone to use a proprietary network or service not open to the general Internet user.  The intent is that, while the community of those who might actively use the names assigned within that NID might be small, the potential use of identifiers within that NID is open to any user on the Internet.  Formal NIDs might be appropriate when some aspects are not fully open.  For example, a namespace might make use of a fee-based, privately managed, or proprietary registry for assignment of URNs in the namespace.  However, it might still benefit some Internet users if the associated services have openly-published access protocols.</t>
        <t>An organization that will assign URNs within a formal namespace ought to meet the following criteria:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>Organizational stability and the ability to maintain the URN namespace for a long time; absent such evidence, it ought to be clear how the namespace can remain viable if the organization can no longer maintain the namespace.</t>
            <t>Competency in name assignment.  This will improve the likelihood of persistence (e.g. to minimize the likelihood of conflicts).</t>
            <t>Commitment to not reassigning existing names and to allowing old names to continue to be valid, even if the owners or assignees of those names are no longer members or customers of that organization.  With regard to URN resolution <xref target='RFC2276'/>, this does not mean that there needs to be resolution of such names, only that the names will not resolve to false or stale information.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>A formal namespace establishes a particular NID, subject to the following constraints (above and beyond the syntax rules specified in <xref target='I-D.ietf-urnbis-rfc2141bis-urn'/>):</t>
        <t>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>It MUST NOT be an already-registered NID.</t>
            <t>It MUST NOT start with "urn-" (which is reserved for informal namespaces).</t>
            <t>It MUST be more than two characters long.</t>
            <t>It MUST NOT start with "XY-", where "XY" is any combination of two ASCII letters.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>All two-letter combinations, and all two-letter combinations followed by "-" and any sequence of valid NID characters, are reserved for potential use as countrycode-based NIDs for eventual national registrations of URN namespaces.  The definition and scoping of rules for allocation of responsibility for such countrycode-based namespaces is beyond the scope of this document.</t>
      </section>

      <section title='Informal Namespaces' anchor='types-informal'>
        <t>Informal namespaces are full-fledged URN namespaces, with all the associated rights and responsibilities.  Informal namespaces differ from formal namespaces in the process for assigning a NID: IANA will assign an alphanumeric NID (e.g., "urn-7") to informal namespaces, with the following syntax:</t>
        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
    "urn-" <number>
          ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>The only restrictions on &lt;number&gt; are that it (1) consist strictly of ASCII digits and (2) not cause the NID to exceed the length limitations defined in the URN syntax specification <xref target='I-D.ietf-urnbis-rfc2141bis-urn'/>.</t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section title='Defining a URN Namespace' anchor='definition'>

      <t>The definition of a formal namespace ought to pay particular attention to:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>The purpose of the namespace.</t>
          <t>The syntax of URNs assigned within the namespace.</t>
          <t>The process for assigning URNs within the namespace.</t>
          <t>The security implications of assigning and using the assigned URNs.</t>
          <t>Optionally, the process for resolving URNs issued within the namepace.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>The following sections explain these matters in greater detail.  For convenience, a template for defining and registering a URN namespace is provided under <xref target='template'/>.  This information can be especially helpful to entities that wish to request assignment of a URN in a namespace and to entities that wish to provide URN resolution for a namespace.</t>

      <section title='Purpose' anchor='definition-purpose'>
        <t>The "Purpose" section of the template describes matters such as:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>The kinds of resources identified by URNs assigned within the namespace.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
            <t>Why it is preferable to use URNs rather than some other technology (e.g., URIs) and why existing URN namespace (if any) are not a good fit.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
            <t>The kinds of software applications that can use or resolve the assigned URNs (e.g., by differentiating among disparate namespaces, identifying resources in a persistent fashion, or meaningfully resolving and accessing services associated with the namespace).<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
            <t>The scope of the namespace (public vs. private, global vs. local to a particular organization, nation, or industry).  For example, a namespace claiming to deal in "social security numbers" ought to have a global scope and address all social security number structures, whereas a URN scheme for a particular national system would need to handle only that nation's social security numbers.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
            <t>How the intended community (and the Internet community at large) will benefit from using or resolving the assigned URNs.</t>
            </list>
          </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Syntax' anchor='definition-syntax'>
        <t>The "Syntax" section of the template describes:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>A description of the structure of URNs within the namespace, in conformance with the fundamental URN syntax <xref target='I-D.ietf-urnbis-rfc2141bis-urn'/>.  The structure might be described in terms of a formal definition (e.g., using Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications (ABNF) as specified in <xref target='RFC5234'/>), an algorithm for generating conformant URNs, a regular expression for parsing the identifier into components, or by explaining that the structure is opaque.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
            <t>Any special character encoding rules for assigned URNs (e.g., which character ought to always be used for single-quotes).<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
            <t>Rules for determining equivalence between two identifiers in the namespace.  Such rules ought to always have the effect of eliminating false negatives that might otherwise result from comparison.  If it is appropriate and helpful, reference can be made to the equivalence rules defined in the URI specification <xref target='RFC3986'/>.  Examples of equivalence rules include equivalence between uppercase and lowercase characters in the Namespace Specific String, between hyphenated and non-hyphenated groupings in the identifier string, or between single-quotes and double-quotes.  (Note that these are not normative statements for any kind of best practice related to handling of equivalences between characters in general; they are statements limited to this specific namespace only.)<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
            <t>Any special considerations necessary for conforming with the URN syntax.  This is particularly applicable in the case of legacy naming systems that are used in the context of URNs.  For example, if a namespace is used in contexts other than URNs, it might make use of characters that are reserved in the URN syntax.  This section ought to note any such characters, and outline necessary mappings to conform to URN syntax.  Normally, this will be handled by percent-encoding the character as specified in the URI specification <xref target='RFC3986'/>.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Assignment' anchor='definition-assignment'>
        <t>The "Assignment" section of the template describes matters such as:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>Mechanisms or authorities for assigning URNs to resources.  It ought to make clear whether assignment is completely open (e.g., following a particular algorithm), completely closed (e.g., for a private organization), or limited in various ways (e.g., delegated to authorities recognized by a particular organization); if limited, it ought to explain how to become an assigner of identifiers or how to request assignemtn of identifers from existing assignment authorities.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
            <t>Methods for ensuring that URNs within the namespace are unique.  For example, identifiers might be assigned sequentially or in accordance with some well-defined process by a single authority, assignment might be partitioned among delegated authorities that are individually responsible for respecting uniqueness rules, or URNs might be minted independently following an algorithm that itself guarantees uniqueness.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
            <t>Methods for ensuring the longevity and maintainability of the namespace and URNs assigned with the namespace.  Although non-reassignment of URNs ensures that a URN will persist in identifying a particular resource even after the "lifetime of the resource" or the assignment authority, some consideration ought to be given to the persistence of the usability of the URN.  This is particularly important in the case of URN namespaces providing global resolution.</t>
          </list>
        </t>

      </section>

      <section title='Security' anchor='definition-security'>
        <t>The "Security" section of the template describes any potential security-related issues with regard to assignment, use, and resolution of identifiers within the namespace.  Examples of such issues include the consequences of producing false negatives and false positives during comparison for equivalence (see also <xref target='RFC6943'/>), leakage of private information when identifiers are communicated on the public Internet, the potential for directory harvesting, and various issues discussed in the guidelines for security considerations in RFCs <xref target='RFC3552'/>.</t> 
      </section>

      <section title='Resolution' anchor='definition-resolution'>
        <t>The "Resolution" section specifies the rules for resolution of URNs assigned within the namespace.  If such URNs are intended to be resolvable, the namespace needs to be registered in a Resolution Discovery System (RDS, see <xref target='RFC2276'/>) such as DDDS.  Resolution then proceeds according to standard URI resolution processes, as well as the mechanisms of the RDS.  This section ought to lists the requirements for becoming a recognized resolver of URNs in the relevant namespace (and being so listed in the RDS registry).  Answers might include, but are not limited to:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>The namespace is not listed with an RDS; therefore this section is not applicable.</t>
            <t>Resolution mirroring is completely open, with a mechanism for updating an appropriate RDS.</t>
            <t>Resolution is controlled by entities to which assignment has been delegated.</t>

    <section title='Guidelines for Designated Experts' anchor='guidelines'>
      <t>Experience to date with NID registration requests has shown that registrants sometimes do not initially understand some of the subtleties of URN namespaces, and that defining the namespace in the form of a specification enables the registrants to clearly formulate their "contract" with the intended user community.  Therefore, although the registration policy for formal namespaces is Expert Review and a specification is not required, the designated experts for NID registration requests are encouraged to prefer that a specification exist documenting the namespace definition.</t>

    <section title='IANA Considerations' anchor='iana'>
      <t>This document outlines the processes for registering URN namespaces, and has implications for the IANA in terms of registries to be maintained.

    </section>

    <section title='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
      <t>This document largely focuses on providing mechanisms for the declaration of public information.  Nominally, these declarations will be of relatively low security profile, however there is always the danger of "spoofing" and providing misinformation.  Information in these declarations ought to be taken as advisory.</t>
      <t>The definition of a URN namespace needs to account for potential security issues related to assignment, use, and resolution of identifiers within the namespace.</t>

<abstract>
<t>
A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters
that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  This specification
defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references
that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security
considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.
The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs,
allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI
reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every
possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative
grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual
specifications of each URI scheme.

<abstract>
<t>Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).&lt;/t>&lt;t> In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA.&lt;/t>&lt;t> This document obsoletes RFC 2434. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>
   This document addresses the issues of the discovery of URN (Uniform
   Resource Name) resolver services that in turn will directly translate
   URNs into URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) and URCs (Uniform Resource
   Characteristics).  The document falls into three major parts, the
   assumptions underlying the work, the guidelines in order to be a
   viable Resolver Discovery Service or RDS, and a framework for
   designing RDSs.  The guidelines fall into three principle areas:
   evolvability, usability, and security and privacy.  An RDS that is
   compliant with the framework will not necessarily be compliant with
   the guidelines.  Compliance with the guidelines will need to be
   validated separately.

<t>Internet technical specifications often need to define a formal syntax.  Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications.  The current specification documents ABNF.  It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.  This specification also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

<title>Issues in Identifier Comparison for Security Purposes</title>

<date year='2013' month='May' />
<abstract>
<t>Identifiers such as hostnames, URIs, IP addresses, and email addresses are often used in security contexts to identify security principals and resources.  In such contexts, an identifier presented via some protocol is often compared using some policy to make security decisions such as whether the security principal may access the resource, what level of authentication or encryption is required, etc.  If the parties involved in a security decision use different algorithms to compare identifiers, then failure scenarios ranging from denial of service to elevation of privilege can result.  This document provides a discussion of these issues that designers should consider when defining identifiers and protocols, and when constructing architectures that use multiple protocols.</t></abstract></front>
