Abstract

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SDP) is the subject of numerous
   specifications that have been produced by the IETF.  It can be
   difficult to locate the right document, or even to determine the set
   of Request for Comments (RFC) about SDP.  This specification serves
   as a guide to the SDP RFC series.  It lists a current snapshot of the
   specifications under the SDP umbrella, briefly summarises each, and
   groups them into categories.

2.  Introduction

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] is the subject of
   numerous specifications that have been produced by the IETF.  It can
   be difficult to locate the right document, or even to determine the
   set of Request for Comments (RFC) about SDP.

   This specification serves as a guide to the SDP RFC series.  It is a
   current snapshot of the specifications under the SDP umbrella at the
   time of publication.  It is anticipated that this document itself
   will be regularly updated as SDP specifications mature.  Furthermore,
   it references many specifications, which, at the time of publication
   of this document, were not yet finalised, and may eventually be
   completed or abandoned.  Therefore, the enumeration of specifications
   here is a work-in-progress and subject to change.

   For each specification, a paragraph or so description is included
   that summarises the purpose of the specification.  Each specification
   also includes a letter that designates its category in the Standards
   Track [RFC2026].  These values are:

      S: Standards Track (Proposed Standard, Draft Standard, or
      Standard)

      E: Experimental

      B: Best Current Practice

      I: Informational

   The specifications are grouped together by topic.  The topics are:

   Core:  The SDP specifications that are expected to be utilised for
      each session or registration an endpoint participates in.

   General Purpose Infrastructure:  General purpose extensions to SDP,
      but the ones that are not expected to always be used.

   NAT Traversal:  Specifications to deal with firewall and NAT
      traversal.

   Quality of Service:  Specifications related to multimedia quality of
      service (QoS).

   Operations and Management:  Specifications related to configuration
      and monitoring of SDP deployments.

Internet-Draft          Hitchhiker's guide to SDP             March 2012


   Minor Extensions:  Specifications that solve a narrow problem space
      or provide an optimisation.

   Security Mechanisms:  Specifications providing security functionality
      for SDP.

   Conferencing:  Specifications for multimedia conferencing.

   Typically, SDP extensions fit naturally into topic areas, and
   implementors interested in a particular topic often implement many or
   all of the specifications in that area.  There are some
   specifications that fall into multiple topic areas, but generally
   they will be listed only once.

   This document itself is not an update to [RFC4566] or an extension to
   SDP.  It is an informational document, meant to guide newcomers,
   implementers, and deployers to the many specifications associated
   with SDP.

3.  Core SDP specifications

   RFC 2327,  Session Description Protocol (S): [RFC2327] defines the
      original SDP protocol.  The RFC has been obsoleted by its
      successor [RFC4566].

   RFC 3264,  An Offer/Answer Model with the Session Description
      Protocol (S): [RFC3264] defines how SDP is used with SIP [RFC3261]
      to negotiate the parameters of a media session.  It is in
      widespread usage and an integral part of the behaviour of SIP.

   RFC 4566,  Session Description Protocol (S): [RFC4566] defines a
      format for representing multimedia sessions.  SDP objects are
      carried in the body of SIP messages and, based on the offer/answer
      model, are used to negotiate the media characteristics of a
      session between users.

4.  General purpose infrastructure extensions

   RFC 3266,  Support for IPv6 in Session Description Protocol (SDP)
      (S): [RFC3266] describes the use of Internet Protocol Version 6
      (IPv6) addresses in conjunction with the Session Description
      Protocol (SDP).  The document clarifies existing text in SDP in
      regard to the syntax of IPv6 addresses.

   RFC 3388,  Grouping of Media Lines in the Session Description
      Protocol (S): [RFC3388] defines a framework for grouping together
      media streams in an SDP message.  Such a grouping allows
      relationships between these streams, such as which stream is the
      audio for a particular video feed, to be expressed.

   RFC 4091,  The Alternative Network Address Types (ANAT) Semantics for
      the Session Description Protocol (SDP) Grouping Framework (S):
      [RFC4091] defines a mechanism for including both IPv4 and IPv6
      addresses to establish a media stream.  This mechanism has been
      deprecated in favor of ICE [ICE].

   RFC 4145,  TCP-Based Media Transport in the Session Description
      Protocol (SDP) (S): [RFC4145] defines an extension to SDP for
      setting up TCP-based sessions between user agents.  It defines who
      sets up the connection and how its lifecycle is managed.  It has
      seen relatively little usage due to the small number of media
      types to date that use TCP.

5.  NAT Traversal

   RFC3605,  Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP) Attribute in the Session
      Description Protocol (SDP) (S): [RFC3605] defines a way to
      explicitly signal, within an SDP message, the IP address and port
      for RTCP, rather than using the port+1 rule in the Real Time
      Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550].  It is needed for devices
      behind NAT, and the specification is required by ICE.

6.  Minor extensions

   RFC3890,  A Transport Independent Bandwidth Modifier for the Session
      Description Protocol (SDP) (S): [RFC3890] specifies an SDP
      extension that allows for the description of the bandwidth for a
      media session that is independent of the underlying transport
      mechanism.

   RFC 4796,  The SDP (Session Description Protocol) Content Attribute
      (S): [RFC4796] defines an SDP attribute for describing the purpose
      of a media stream.  Examples include a slide view, the speaker, a
      sign language feed, and so on.

7.  Security mechanisms

   RFC4567,  Key Management Extensions for Session Description Protocol
      (SDP) and Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) (S): [RFC4567]
      defines extensions to SDP that allow tunneling of a key management
      protocol, namely MIKEY [RFC3830], through offer/answer exchanges.
      This mechanism is one of three Secure Realtime Transport Protocol
      (SRTP) keying techniques specified for SIP, with Datagram
      Transport Layer Security (DTLS)-SRTP [RFC5683] having been
      selected as the final solution.

   RFC4568,  Session Description Protocol (SDP) Security Descriptions
      for Media Streams (S): [RFC4568] defines extensions to SDP that
      allow for the negotiation of keying material directly through
      offer/answer, without a separate key management protocol.  This
      mechanism, sometimes called sdescriptions, has the drawback that
      the media keys are available to any entity that has visibility to
      the SDP.  It is one of three SRTP keying techniques specified for
      SIP, with DTLS-SRTP [RFC5683] having been selected as the final
      solution.

   RFC4572,  Connection-Oriented Media Transport over the Transport
      Layer Security (TLS) Protocol in the Session Description Protocol
      (SDP) (S): [RFC4572] specifies a mechanism for signaling TLS-
      based media streams between endpoints.  It expands the TCP-based
      media signaling parameters defined in [RFC4145] to include
      fingerprint information for TLS streams so that TLS can operate
      between end hosts using self-signed certificates.

   RFC5027,  Security Preconditions for Session Description Protocol
      Media Streams (S): [RFC5027] defines a precondition for use with
      the preconditions framework [RFC3312].  The security precondition
      prevents a session from being established until a security media
      stream is set up.

8.  Conferencing

   RFC4574,  The SDP (Session Description Protocol) Label Attribute (S):
      [RFC4574] defines an SDP attribute for providing an opaque label
      for media streams.  These labels can be referred to by external
      documents, and in particular, by conference policy documents.
      This allows a UA to tie together documents it may obtain through
      conferencing mechanisms to media streams to which they refer.

   RFC4583,  Session Description Protocol (SDP) Format for Binary Floor
      Control Protocol (BFCP) Streams (S): [RFC4583] defines a mechanism
      in SDP to signal floor control streams that use BFCP.  It is used
      for push-to-talk and conference floor control.
