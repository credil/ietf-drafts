Internet-Draft      IMAP4 Multi-Account Extension         November 2011 
    

   Simultaneous authentication of multiple mail accounts belonging to a 
   single user is an attractive feature but is not supported in the 
   current Internet Message Access Protocol [RFC3501]. This document 
   introduces an extension of the Internet Message Access Protocol, 
   Version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1). With this extension, when a client is 
   authenticated with one of its user identifiers, all the other 
   associated user identifiers (if present) are also regarded as 
   authenticated ones. Furthermore, this document specifies the syntax 
   of LISTA and SELECTA commands for the IMAP4rev1 protocol. With LISTA 
   command, a client can obtain a list of all the identifiers 
   authenticated for the user. With SELECTA command, a client can select 
   one of the user's authenticated identifiers and then gain access to 
   all the mailboxes belonging to that identifier, without having to log 
   out and re-log in with that identifier.

1. Introduction 

   In practice, it's often desirable for a user to have multiple email 
   accounts. However, according to the current Internet Message Access 
   Protocol, Version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1) [RFC3501], if a user needs to 
   access an account after he/she has been authenticated for a different 
   one, he/she has to first log out of the current account and then be 
   re-authenticated for the desired one. For the sake of a better user 
   experience, this document introduces an extension of the IMAP4rev1 
   protocol. With this extension, a user can have multiple user 
   identifiers associated with each other. Once one of the user's 
   identifiers is successfully authenticated, all the other associated 
   identifiers will also be treated as authenticated ones for the 
   succeeding transactions. 

   Furthermore, this document introduces LISTA and SELECTA commands into 
   the IMAP4rev1 protocol. With LISTA command, a client can obtain a

   list of all the authenticated identifiers bound to a certain 
   identifier. With SELECTA command, a client, in an authenticated state, 
   can select one of the user's authenticated identifiers and work on 
   the mailboxes belonging to that selected identifier. Before 
   implementing this command, it is assumed that the client has already 
   been authenticated with multiple associated identifiers. The purpose 
   of this SELECTA command is to allow the client to access the 
   mailboxes or folders belonging to different user identifiers without 
   having to log out and re-log in with a different user identifier. 

2. Conventions used in this document 

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and 
   server respectively. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].  

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation   
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be    
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance. 

3. Specification 

3.1. Authentication of Associated Identifiers 

   A user's registration profile SHOULD indicate the association of the 
   user's multiple identifiers, as requested by the user. 

   During the authentication process initiated by a client's 
   AUTHENTICATE or LOGIN command, the server SHOULD check that client's 
   user registration profile to find out whether or not there are any 
   other user identifiers associated with the one provided by the client 
   in the authentication process. In the case where the client's user 
   registration profile indicates the association of multiple user 
   identifiers, once the client is successfully authenticated with the 
   user identifier provided by the client in the authentication process, 
   all those associated user identifiers listed in the registration 
   profile SHOULD also be treated as authenticated ones for the 
   succeeding transactions. In one word, a successful authentication for 
   a single user identifier brings all the associated user identifiers 
   into the authenticated states. 

3.2. LISTA Command 

   Arguments:  user identifier

   Responses:  no specific responses for this command 

   Result:     OK - lista completed 
               NO - lista failure: user identifier rejected 
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid 

   The LISTA command SHALL only be implemented when the connection is in 
   the authenticated state. The LISTA command returns a list of all the 
   authenticated user identifiers bound to the one given as the argument. 
   An OK response represents a valid listing.  

   Example:    C: A001 LISTA bob1@abcd.com 
               S: * 2 EXISTS 
               S: * LISTA bob1@abcd.com 
               S: * LISTA bob2@defg.com 
               S: A001 OK LISTA completed 
    

3.3. SELECTA Command 

   Arguments:  user identifier 

   Responses:  no specific responses for this command 

   Result:     OK - selecta completed 
               NO - selecta failure: user identifier rejected 
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid 

   The SELECTA command SHALL only be implemented when the connection is 
   in the authenticated state. The SELECTA command selects one of the 
   associated user identifiers that have been authenticated for the user, 
   as an active account. An OK response represents a valid selection and 
   the succeeding operations are performed with respect to the selected 
   user identifier. For instance, a SELECT command following a SELECTA 
   command means the selection of a mailbox belonging to the user 
   identifier chosen by the SELECTA command. 

   Example:    C: A140 SELECTA bob1@abcd.com 
               S: A140 OK SELECTA completed 
               C: A141 SELECT INBOX 
               S: * 172 EXISTS 
               S: * 1 RECENT 
               S: * OK [UNSEEN 12] Message 12 is first unseen 
               S: * OK [UIDVALIDITY 3857529045] UIDs valid 
               S: * OK [UIDNEXT 4392] Predicted next UID 
               S: * FLAGS (\Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Seen \Draft) 
               S: * OK [PERMANENTFLAGS (\Deleted \Seen \*)] Limited

               S: A141 OK [READ-WRITE] SELECT completed 
               (The mailbox "INBOX" belonging to the account  
               "bob1@abcd.com" has been selected.)
