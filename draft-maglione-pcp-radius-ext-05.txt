              RADIUS Extensions for Port Control Protocol
                    draft-maglione-pcp-radius-ext-05

Abstract

   This memo specifies a new Remote Authentication Dial In User Service
   (RADIUS) attribute to carry one or a list of Port Control Protocol
   (PCP) Server Names.  This attribute can be configured on a RADIUS
   server so that the information can be conveyed to Network Access
   Server (NAS) via RADIUS protocol, and the co-located Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol (DHCP/DHCPv6) server can then populate the
   information to PCP client.

1.  Introduction

   Port Control Protocol (PCP) [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] provides a mechanism
   to control how incoming packets are forwarded by upstream devices
   such as NATs and firewalls.  PCP is a client-server protocol where a
   PCP client may reside on a host, a Customer Premises Equipment (CPE),
   etc., which communicates with a PCP server that may reside anywhere
   in a network.

   [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] defines a procedure for the PCP client to
   communicate with its PCP Server.  The IP address of the PCP Server(s)
   can be configured to the PCP Client; if not the PCP Client assumes
   its default router as being its PCP Server.

   [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp] defines DHCPv6 and DHCPv4 options which are meant
   to be used by a PCP client to discover a PCP server name.  However,
   provisioning for name of the PCP server is required on a DHCPv4/
   DHCPv6 server before it can populate this information.

   Auto-configuration on a DHCPv4/DHCPv6 is possible in a broadband
   network, where typically, user profile is maintained on a Remote
   Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) server and RADIUS
   protocol [RFC2865] is used to convey user-related information to
   other network elements including a host and CPE.
   [I-D.ietf-radext-ipv6-access] describes a typical broadband network
   scenario in which the Network Access Server (NAS) acts as the access
   gateway for the users (hosts or CPEs) and the NAS embeds a DHCPv6
   Server function that allows it to locally handle any DHCPv6 requests
   issued by the clients.

   In such environment, PCP server's name can be configured on a RADIUS
   server, which then passes the information to a NAS that co-locates
   with the DHCPv4/DHCPv6 server, which in turn populates the location
   of the PCP server.

   This memo defines a new RADIUS attribute that can be used to carry
   one or a list of PCP server names.  As defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp], a PCP Server Name can be a DNS name, IP literals
   strings, etc.  This document is designed to allow for configuring PCP
   Server name(s) which can be a DNS name, IP literals or any strings
   which may be passed to a local name resolution library on the PCP
   client side.  Operational considerations related to the configuration
   of PCP Server names are similar to those discussed in Section 4 and
   Section 7 of [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp].  The proposed RADIUS option is
   designed to accommodate various deployment contexts (e.g., dedicated
   option per IP connectivity context, single option for dual-stack
   access, etc.).

   The approach described above is already used for providing the FQDN
   of the AFTR in the DS-Lite scenario [RFC6333] and the equivalent
   RADIUS attribute for the DS-Lite Tunnel Name is defined [RFC6519].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following terms are defined in [I-D.ietf-pcp-base]:

        - Port forwarding
        - PCP
        - PCP client
        - PCP Server
   The following term is defined in [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp]:

        - PCP Server Name


3.  PCP Server Configuration using RADIUS and DHCPv4/DHCPv6

   Figure 1 illustrates an example of how RADIUS protocol works together
   with DHCPv6, to allow a host to learn automatically the name of a PCP
   server in case of a PPP session that carries IPv6 traffic.

   The Network Access Server (NAS) operates as a client of RADIUS and
   co-locates with a DHCPv6 Server for DHCPv6.  The NAS initially sends
   a RADIUS Access Request message to the RADIUS server, requesting
   authentication.  Once the RADIUS server receives the request, it
   validates the sending client and if the request is approved, the
   RADIUS server replies with an Access Accept message including a list
   of attribute-value pairs that describe the parameters to be used for
   this session.  This list MAY also contain the name of a PCP server.
   When the co-located DHCPv6 server receives a DHCPv6 message
   containing the PCP Server Option, it SHALL use the name returned in
   the RADIUS attribute as defined in this memo to populate the DHCPv6
   PCP Server option defined in [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp]

        Figure 1: RADIUS and DHCPv6 Message Flow for a PPP Session

   The Figure 2 illustrates how the RADIUS protocol and DHCPv6 work
   together to accomplish PCP client configuration when DHCPv6 is used
   to provide connectivity to a requesting host.

   The difference between this message flow and previous one is that in
   this scenario the interaction between NAS and AAA/ RADIUS Server is
   triggered by the DHCPv6 Solicit message received by the NAS from the
   DHCPv6 client, while in case of a PPP Session the trigger is the PPP
   LCP Config Request message received by the NAS.

        Figure 2: RADIUS and DHCPv6 Message Flow for an IP Session

   In the scenario depicted in Figure 2 the Access-Request packet
   contains a Service-Type attribute with the value Authorize Only (17),
   thus according to [RFC5080] the Access-Request packet MUST contain a
   State attribute.

   A similar message flow also applies to the IPv4 scenario when DHCPv4
   is used to provide connectivity to the user (Figure 3).

        Figure 3: RADIUS and DHCPv4 Message Flow for an IP Session

   After receiving the PCP server name in the initial Access-Accept the
   NAS MUST store the received PCP Server Name locally.  When the PCP
   Client sends a DHCPv4 message to request an extension of the
   lifetimes for the assigned address or prefix, the NAS does not have
   to initiate a new Access-Request towards the AAA server to request
   the PCP server name.  The NAS retrieves the previously stored PCP
   Server name and uses it in its reply.

   If the DHCPv4 server to which the DHCP Renew message was sent at time
   T1 has not responded, the DHCPv4 client initiates a Rebind/Reply
   exchange with any available server.  In this scenario the NAS MUST
   initiate a new Access-Request towards the AAA server, after the co-
   located DHCPv4 server receives the DHCP message.  The NAS MAY include
   the PCP Server Name attribute in its Access-Request.

   If the NAS does not receive the PCP server name attribute in the
   Access-Accept it MAY fallback to a pre-configured default tunnel
   name, if any.  If the NAS does not have any pre-configured default
   tunnel name or if the NAS receives an Access-Reject, the PCP client
   can not be configured by the NAS.

   The scenario with PPP Session and IPv4 only connectivity does not
   require DHCPv4: the whole configuration of the client is performed by
   PPP.  This case is out of scope of this document because in order to
   complete the configuration of the PCP client a new PPP IPC option

   would be required.


4.  RADIUS Attribute

   A new RADIUS attribute, called PCP-Server-Name, along with its format
   is defined below.

   Description

   The PCP-server-name attribute contains a name or a list of names that
   refers to a PCP server the client requests to establish a connection
   to for PCP related service.  The NAS shall use the name returned in
   the RADIUS PCP-server-name attribute to populate the PCP Server Name
   DHCP Sub-Option in IPv4 addressing context, or the PCP Server Name
   DHCPv6 Option in IPv6 addressing context, as determined by the DHCP
   server [I-D.ietf-pcp-dhcp].  The same or distinct PCP Server Names
   may be configured; it is out of scope of this document to elaborate
   on this point.  Nevertheless, the PCP-server-name attribute conveys
   an indication for the deployment context.

   The PCP-server-name attribute MAY appear in an Access-Accept packet.
   This attribute MAY be used in Access-Request packets as a hint to the
   RADIUS server; for example if the NAS is pre-configured with a
   default PCP server name, this name MAY be inserted in the attribute.
   The RADIUS server MAY ignore the hint sent by the NAS and it MAY
   assign a different PCP Server name.  If the NAS includes the PCP
   Server Name attribute, but the AAA server does not recognize it, this
   attribute MUST be ignored by the AAA Server.  If the NAS does not
   receive PCP Server Name attribute in the Access-Accept it MAY
   fallback to a pre-configured default PCP server name, if any.  If the
   NAS is pre-provisioned with a default PCP server name and the PCP
   server name received in Access-Accept is different from the
   configured default, then the PCP server name received in the Access-
   Accept message MUST be used for the session.

   The PCP server Name RADIUS attribute MAY be present in Accounting-
   Request records where the Acct-Status-Type is set to Start, Stop or
   Interim-Update.  The PCP Server Name RADIUS attribute MUST NOT appear
   more than once in a message.

   A summary of the PCP-Server-Name RADIUS attribute format is shown
   below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.
