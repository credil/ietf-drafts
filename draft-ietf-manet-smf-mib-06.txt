Internet-Draft                 The SMF-MIB                 December 2012


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring aspects of a
   process implementing Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF) [RFC6621]
   for Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs).  SMF provides multicast
   Duplicate Packet Detection (DPD) and supports algorithms for
   constructing an estimate of a MANET Minimum Connected Dominating Set
   (MCDS) for efficient multicast forwarding.  The SMF-MIB also reports
   state information, performance metrics, and notifications.  In
   addition to configuration, this additional state and performance
   information is useful to operators troubleshooting multicast
   forwarding problems.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   SMF provides methods for implementing DPD-based multicast forwarding
   with the optional use of Connected Dominating Set (CDS)-based relay
   sets.  The CDS provides a complete connected coverage of the nodes
   comprising the MANET.  The MCDS is the smallest set of MANET nodes
   (comprising a connected cluster) which cover all the nodes in the
   cluster with their transmissions.  As the density of the MANET nodes
   increase, the fraction of nodes required in an MCDS decreases.  Using
   the MCDS as a multicast forwarding set then becomes an efficient
   multicast mechanism for MANETs.

Internet-Draft                 The SMF-MIB                 December 2012


   Various algorithms for the construction of estimates of the MCDS
   exist.  The Simplified Multicast Framework [RFC6621] describes some
   of these.  It further defines various operational modes for a node
   which is participating in the collective creation of the MCDS
   estimates.  These modes depend upon the set of related MANET routing
   and discovery protocols and mechanisms in operation in the specific
   MANET node.

   A SMF router's MIB contains SMF process configuration parameters
   (e.g. specific CDS algorithm), state information (e.g., current
   membership in the CDS), performance counters (e.g., packet counters),
   and notifications.

4.1.  SMF Management Model

   This section describes the management model for the SMF node process.

   Figure 1 (reproduced from Figure 4 of [RFC6621]) shows the
   relationship between the SMF Relay Set selection algorithm and the
   related algorithms, processes and protocols running in the MANET
   nodes.  The Relay Set Selection Algorithm (RSSA) can rely upon
   topology information gotten from the MANET Neighborhood Discovery
   Protocol (NHDP), from the specific MANET routing protocol running on
   the node, or from Layer 2 information passed up to the higher layer
   protocol processes.

4.2.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Configuration Objects - switches, tables, objects which are
      initialized to default settings or set through the management
      interface defined by this MIB.

   o  Tunable Configuration Objects - objects whose values affect timing
      or attempt bounds on the SMF RS process.

   o  State Objects - automatically generated values which define the
      current operating state of the SMF RS process in the router.

   o  Performance Objects - automatically generated values which help an
      administrator or automated tool to assess the performance of the
      CDS multicast process on the router and the overall multicast
      performance within the MANET routing domain.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the SMF-MIB module.  The
   objects are arranged into the following groups:

   o  smfMIBNotifications - defines the notifications associated with
      the SMF-MIB.

Internet-Draft                 The SMF-MIB                 December 2012


   o  smfMIBObjects - defines the objects forming the basis for the SMF-
      MIB.  These objects are divided up by function into the following
      groups:

      *  Capabilities Group - This group contains the SMF objects that
         the device uses to advertise its local capabilities with
         respect to, e.g., the supported RSSAs.

      *  Configuration Group - This group contains the SMF objects that
         configure specific options that determine the overall operation
         of the SMF RSSA and the resulting multicast performance.

      *  State Group - Contains information describing the current state
         of the SMF RSSA process such as the Neighbor Table.

      *  Performance Group - Contains objects which help to characterize
         the performance of the SMF RSSA process, typically statistics
         counters.

   o  smfMIBConformance - defines minimal and full conformance of
      implementations to this SMF-MIB.

5.1.  Textual Conventions

   The textual conventions defined within the SMF-MIB are as follows:

   o  The SmfStatus is defined within the SMF-MIB.  This contains the
      current operational status of the SMF process on an interface.

   o  The SmfOpModeID represents an index that identifies a specific SMF
      operational mode.

   o  The SmfRssaID represents an index that identifies, through
      reference, a specific RSSA available for operation on the device.

5.2.  The Capabilities Group

   The SMF device supports a set of capabilities.  The list of
   capabilities which the device can advertise are:

   o  Operational Mode - topology information from NHDP, CDS-aware
      unicast routing or Cross-layer from Layer 2.

   o  SMF RSSA - the specific RSSA operational on the device.  Note that
      configuration, state and performance objects related to a specific
      RSSA must be defined within another separate MIB.

Internet-Draft                 The SMF-MIB                 December 2012


5.3.  The Configuration Group

   The SMF device is configured with a set of controls.  Some of the
   prominent configuration controls for the SMF device follow:

   o  Operational Mode - topology information from NHDP, CDS-aware
      unicast routing or Cross-layer from Layer 2.

   o  SMF RSSA - the specific RSSA operational on the device.

   o  Duplicate Packet detection for IPv4 - Identification-based or
      Hash-based DPD.

   o  Duplicate Packet detection for IPv6 - Identification-based or
      Hash-based DPD.

   o  SMF Type Message TLV - if NHDP mode is selected, then is the SMF
      Type Message TLV may be included in the NHDP exchanges.

   o  SMF Address Block TLV - if NHDP mode is selected, then is the SMF
      Address Block TLV should be included in the NHDP exchanges.

5.4.  The State Group

   The State sub-tree reports current state information, e.g.,

   o  Node RSSA State - is the node currently in or out of the Relay
      Set.

   o  Neighbors Table - a table containing current neighbors and their
      operational RSSA.

5.5.  The Performance Group

   The Performance sub-tree reports primarily counters that relate to
   SMF RSSA performance.  The SMF performance counters consists of per
   node and per interface objects:

   o  Total multicast packets received.

   o  Total multicast packets forwarded.

   o  Total duplicate multicast packets detected.

   o  Per interface statistics table with the following entries:

      *  Multicast packets received.

      *  Multicast packets forwarded.

      *  Duplicate multicast packets detected.

5.6.  The Notifications Group

   The Notifications Sub-tree contains the list of notifications
   supported within the SMF-MIB and their intended purpose or utility.

5.7.  Tables and Indexing

   The SMF-MIB module contains a number of tables which record data
   related to:

   o  configuration and operation of packet forwarding the local router,

   o  configuration and operation of local MANET interfaces on the
      router, and

   o  configuration and operation of various RSSA algorithms for packet
      forwarding.

   The SMF-MIB module's tables are indexed via the following constructs:

   o  smfOpModeCapabilitiesID - which is the index for each of the SMF
      modes.

   o  smfRssaCapabilitiesID - which is the index for each of the RSSAs
      supported by this specific device.

   o  smfConfiguredAddrForwardingAddrType and
      smfConfiguredAddrForwardingFirstAddr - indexes to multicast
      addresses which are forwarded by the SMF process.

   o  smfIfIndex - which is the IfIndex of the local router on which SMF
      is configured.

   o  smfDiscoveredAddrForwardingAddrType and
      smfDiscoveredAddrForwardingFirstAddr - indexes to discovered
      multicast addresses which are forwarded by the SMF process.

   o  smfNeighborIpAddrType, smfNeighborIpAddr, and smfNeighborPrefixLen
      - which is the index set of interface specific neighbor nodes to
      this SMF device.

   These tables and their indexing are:

      'INDEX { smfRssaCapabilitiesID }'.

   o  smfConfiguredAddrForwardingTable - contains information on
      multicast addresses which are to be forwarded by the SMF process
      on this device.  This table has 'INDEX {
      smfConfiguredAddrForwardingAddrType,
      smfConfiguredAddrForwardingFirstAddr }'.

   o  smfInterfaceTable - describes the SMF interfaces on this device
      that are participating in the SMF packet forwarding process.  This

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The SMF-MIB does not
   duplicate those objects.

6.2.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The textual conventions imported for use in the SMF-MIB are as
   follows.  The MODULE-IDENTITY, OBJECT-TYPE, NOTIFICATION-TYPE,
   Counter32, Unsigned32, Integer32 and mib-2 textual conventions are
   imported from RFC 2578 [RFC2578].  The TEXTUAL-CONVENTION, RowStatus
   and TruthValue textual conventions are imported from RFC 2579
   [RFC2579].  The MODULE-COMPLIANCE, OBJECT-GROUP and NOTIFICATION-
   GROUP textual conventions are imported from RFC 2580 [RFC2580].  The
   InterfaceIndexOrZero textual convention is imported from RFC 2863
   [RFC2863].  The SnmpAdminString textual convention is imported from
   RFC 3411 [RFC3411].  The InetAddress, InetAddressType and
   InetAddressPrefixLength textual conventions are imported from RFC
   4001 [RFC4001].

6.3.  Relationship to the Future RSSA-MIBs

   In a sense, the SMF-MIB is a general front-end to a set of, yet to be
   developed, RSSA-specific MIBs.  These RSSA-specific MIBs will define
   the objects for the configuration, state, performance and
   notification objects required for the operation of these specific
   RSSAs.  The SMF-MIB Capabilities Group allows the remote management
   station the ability to query the router to discover the set of
   supported RSSAs.

                 draft.  It is a useful construct, e.g.,
                 an IPTABLES-MIB, but might best be handled
                 as a seperate MIB and worked within a
                 security focused working group.
               - Removed the smfReportsGroup. This capability
                 is being replaced with a new and more general
                 method for offline reporting.  This is being
                 worked as a new MIB module refered to as the

               - added a Capabilities Group within the Objects
                 Group to allow the device to report supported
                 capabilities, e.g., RSSAs supported.
               - added administrative status objects for device
                 and interfaces
               - added multicast address forwarding tables, both
                 for configured (within Configuration Group) and
                 discovered (within the State Group).
               - added additional Performance counters related
                 to DPD functions.
               - Split up the performance counters into IPv4
                 and IPv6, for both global and per interface
                 statistics.
               - Split out the reports capability into a seperate
                 Reports Group under the Objects Group.

                  set selection using information from an associated
                  MANET NHDP process.

              CDS-aware unicast routing operation - a coexistent
                  unicast routing protocol provides dynamic relay
                  set state based upon its own control plane
                  CDS or neighborhood discovery information.

              Cross-layer operation -  SMF operates using
                  neighborhood status and triggers from a
                  cross-layer information base for dynamic relay
                  set selection and maintenance."

8.  Security Considerations

   This section discusses security implications of the choices made in
   this SMF-MIB module.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:






Cole, et al.              Expires June 4, 2013                 [Page 52]

Internet-Draft                 The SMF-MIB                 December 2012


   o  'smfAdminStatus' - this writable configuration object controls the
      operational status of the SMF process.  If this setting is
      configured inconsistently across the MANET multicast domain, then
      delivery of multicast data may be inconsistent across the domain;
      some nodes may not receive multicast data intended for them.

   o  'smfRouterIDAddrType' and 'smfRouterID' - these writable
      configuration objects define the ID of the SMF process.  These
      objects should be configured with a routable address defined on
      the local SMF device.  The smfRouterID is a logical identification
      that MUST be consistent across inter-operating SMF neighborhoods
      and it is RECOMMENDED to be chosen as the numerically largest
      address contained in a node's 'Neighbor Address List' as defined
      in NHDP.  A smfRouterID MUST be unique within the scope of the
      operating MANET network regardless of the method used for
      selecting it.

   o  'smfConfiguredOpMode' - this writable configuration objects define
      the operational mode of the SMF process.  The operational mode
      defines how the SMF process develops its local estimate of the
      CDS.

   o  'smfConfiguredRssa' - this writable configuration object sets the
      specific Reduced Set Selection Algorithm (RSSA) for the SMF
      process.  If this object is set inconsistently across the MANET
      domain, multicast delivery of data will fail.

   o  'smfRssaMember' - this writable configuration object sets the
      'interest' of the local SMF node in participating in the CDS.
      Setting this object to 'never(3)' on a highly highly connected
      device could lead to frequent island formation.  Setting this
      object to 'always(2)' could support data ex-filtration from the
      MANET domain.

   o  'smfIpv4Dpd' - this writable configuration object sets the
      duplicate packet detection method for forwarding of IPv4 multicast
      packets.

   o  'smfIpv6Dpd' - this writable configuration object sets the
      duplicate packet detection method for forwarding of IPv6 multicast
      packets.

   o  'smfMaxPktLifetime' - this writable configuration object sets the
      estimate of the network packet traversal time.  If set too small,
      this could lead to poor multicast data delivery ratios throughout
      the MANET domain.

Internet-Draft                 The SMF-MIB                 December 2012


   o  'smfDpdMaxMemorySize' - this writable configuration object sets
      the memory storage size (in Kilo-Bytes) for the cached DPD records
      for the combined IPv4 and IPv6 methods.  If set too small this
      could lead to poor performance of the duplicate packet protection
      algorithms and lead to inefficient resource, e.g., link,
      utilization within the MANET domain.  The local SMF device should
      protect itself against memory overruns in the event that too large
      a setting is requested.

   o  'smfDpdEntryMaxLifetime' - this writable configuration object sets
      the maximum lifetime (in seconds) for the cached DPD records for
      the combined IPv4 and IPv6 methods.  If the memory is running low
      prior to the MaxLifetimes being exceeded, the local SMF devices
      should purge the oldest records first.

   o  'smfNhdpRssaMesgTLVIncluded' - this writable configuration object
      indicates whether the associated NHDP messages include the the
      RSSA Message TLV, or not.  It is highly RECOMMENDED that this
      object be set to 'true(1)'.

   o  'smfNhdpRssaAddrBlockTLVIncluded' - this writable configuration
      object indicates whether the associated NHDP messages include the
      the RSSA Address Block TLV, or not.  The
      smfNhdpRssaAddrBlockTLVIncluded is optional in all cases as it
      depends on the existence of an address block which may not be
      present.  If this SMF device is configured with NHDP, then this
      object should be set to 'true(1)'.

   o  'smfConfiguredAddrForwardingTable' - the writable configuration
      objects in this table indicate which multicast IP address are to
      be forwarded by this SMF node.  Misconfiguration of rows within
      this table can limit the ability of this SMF device to forward
      multicast data.

   o  'smfInterfaceTable' - the writable configuration objects in this
      table indicate which SMF node interfaces are participating in the
      SMF packet forwarding process.  Misconfiguration of rows within
      this table can limit the ability of this SMF device to forward
      multicast data.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:




Cole, et al.              Expires June 4, 2013                 [Page 54]

Internet-Draft                 The SMF-MIB                 December 2012


   o  'smfNodeRsStatusIncluded' - this readable state object indicates
      that this SMF node is part of the CDS, or not.  Being part of the
      CDS makes this node a distinguished device.  It could be exploited
      for data ex-filtration, or denial of service attacks.

   o  'smfDiscoveredAddrForwardingTable' - the readable state objects in
      this table indicate which, dynamically discovered, multicast IP
      address are to be forwarded by this SMF node.

   o  'smfNeighborTable' - the readable state objects in this table
      indicate current neighbor nodes to this SMF node.  Exposing this
      information to an attacker could allow the attacker easier access
      to the larger MANET domain.

   The remainder of the objects in the SMF-MIB are performance counter
   objects.  While these give an indication of the activity of the SMF
   process on this node, it is not expected that exposing these values
   pose a security risk to the MANET network.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   Implementations MUST provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410] ), including full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  Applicability Statement

   This document describes objects for configuring parameters of the
   Simplified Multicast Forwarding [RFC6621] process on a router.  This
   MIB module, denoted SMF-MIB, also reports state, performance
   information and notifications.  This sections provides some examples
   of how this MIB module can be used in MANET network deployments.  A

Internet-Draft                 The SMF-MIB                 December 2012


   fuller discussion of MANET network management use cases and
   challenges will be provided elsewhere.

   SMF is designed to allow routers to forward IPv4 and IPv6 packets
   over the MANET and cover the MANET nodes through the automatic
   discovery of efficient estimates of the Minimum Connected Dominating
   Set (MCDS) of nodes within the MANET.  The MCDS are estimated using
   the RSSAs discussed within this document.  In the following, three
   scenarios are listed where this MIB module is useful, i.e.,

   o  For a Parking Lot Initial Configuration Situation - it is common
      for the vehicles comprising the MANET being forward deployed at a
      remote location, e.g., the site of a natural disaster, to be off-
      loaded in a parking lot where an initial configuration of the
      networking devices is performed.  The configuration is loaded into
      the devices from a fixed location Network Operation Center (NOC)
      at the parking lot and the vehicles are stationary at the parking
      lot while the configuration changes are made.  Standards-based
      methods for configuration management from the co-located NOC are
      necessary for this deployment option.

   o  For Mobile vehicles with Low Bandwidth Satellite Link to a Fixed
      NOC - Here the vehicles carrying the MANET routers carry multiple
      wireless interfaces, one of which is a relatively low-bandwidth
      on-the-move satellite connection which interconnects a fix NOC to
      the nodes of the MANET.  Standards-based methods for monitoring
      and fault management from the fixed NOC are necessary for this
      deployment option.

   o  For Fixed NOC and Mobile Local Manager in Larger Vehicles - for
      larger vehicles, a hierarchical network management arrangement is
      useful.  Centralized network management is performed from a fixed
      NOC while local management is performed locally from within the
      vehicles.  Standards-based methods for configuration, monitoring
      and fault management are necessary for this deployment option.

Appendix A.  Change Log

   This section tracks the revision history in the development of this
   SMF-MIB.  It will be removed from the final version of this document.

   These changes were made from draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-05 to
   draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-06.

   1.  Only minor editorial and formatting changes were made to this
       document revision.  No substantive changes were made to the SMF-
       MIB module itself.

   These changes were made from draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-04 to
   draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-05.

Internet-Draft                 The SMF-MIB                 December 2012


   1.  Updated the smfInterfaceTable to reflect that fact that we want
       it to 'sparsely augment' the ifTable.

   2.  Added a section to the text discussing the SMF Tables and their
       indexing.

   3.  Added the section on 'Applicability Statement'.

   4.  Added/checked for DEFVAL, REFERENCES, UNITS and SIZE clauses
       within the MIB.

   These changes were made from draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-03 to
   draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-04.

   1.  Removed the bitmap switch in the notifications control group.

   2.  Moved the notification Objects group up to support reverse-
       mapping between SNMPv1 traps and SNMPv2 notifications.

   3.  Removed reference to the notifications state group.

   4.  Replaced smfIfIndex with smfIfName in notifications.

   These changes were made from draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-02 to
   draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-03.

   1.  Clarified and added discussion of default values for several of
       the configuration objects within the MIB.

   2.  Added the security section.

   These changes were made from draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-01 to
   draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-02.

   1.  Added the NotificationGroup to the MIB and updated the
       ConformanceGroup.

   2.  Added the definition of an smfRouterID to the MIB.  This is later
       used in the Notifications to indicate the origin of the event to
       the management station.

   3.  Removed the Router Priority object as this was used only in the
       eCDS algorithm and hence should be contained within the future
       eCDS-MIB.

   4.  Cleaned up the TEXTUAL CONVENTION for the `SmfOpMode'.

   5.  Filled in some of the missing text in various object
       descriptions.

   These changes were made from draft-ietf-manet-smf-mib-00 to
   draft-ietf-manet-dsmf-mib-01.

   1.  Editorial changes to the textual material.  These included the
       addition of the paragraphs on TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONS defined and
       imported into this MIB and relationships to other MIBs.

   2.  Identified those objects in the SMF-MIB requiring non-volatile
       storage.

   3.  Changed the name of the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION 'Status', defined
       within this MIB to 'SmfStatus'.

Appendix B.  Open Issues

   This section contains the set of open issues related to the
   development and design of the SMF-MIB.  This section will not be
   present in the final version of the MIB and will be removed once all
   the open issues have been resolved.

   1.  A careful review by the working group.
