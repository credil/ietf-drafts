             Improving "Rough Consensus" with Running Code
                     draft-sheffer-running-code-01

Abstract

   This document describes a simple process that allows authors of
   Internet-Drafts to record the status of known implementations.  This
   will allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration
   to documents that have the benefit of running code and potentially
   reward the documented protocols by treating the documents with
   implementations preferentially.

   The process in this document is offered as an experiment.  Authors of
   Internet-Drafts are encouraged to consider using the process for
   their documents, and working groups are invited to think about
   applying the process to all of their protocol specifications.

   The authors of this document intend to collate experiences with this
   experiment and to report them to the community.

Status of this Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

Internet-Draft                Running Code                 December 2012


1.  Introduction

   Most IETF participants are familiar with the saying, "rough consensus
   and running code" [tao], and can identify with its pragmatic
   approach.  However, there are many examples of Internet-Drafts
   containing protocol specification that have gone through to
   publication as Proposed Standard RFCs without implementation.  Some
   of them may never get implemented.

   Over time, a variety of policies have been implemented within the
   IETF to consider running code.  In the Routing Area it used to be a
   requirement that one or more implementations must exist before an
   Internet-Draft could be published as a Proposed Standard RFC
   [RFC1264].  That RFC was later obsoleted and the requirement for
   implementation was lifted, but each working group was given the
   authority to impose its own implementation requirements [RFC4794] and
   at least one working group (IDR) continues to require two independent
   implementations.

   The hypothesis behind this document is that there are benefits to the
   IETF standardization process of producing implementations of protocol
   specifications before publication as RFCs.  These benefits, which
   include determining that the specification is comprehensible and that
   there is sufficient interest to implement, are further discussed in
   Section 4.

   This document describes a simple process that allows authors of
   Internet-Drafts to record the status of known implementations.  This
   will allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration
   to documents that have the benefit of running code and potentially
   reward the documented protocols by treating the documents with
   implementations preferentially.

   Contrary to proposals to fast-track Internet-Drafts that have
   associated source code implementations [I-D.farrell-ft], this
   document provides a mechanism to record and publicize the existence
   of running code.  It is up to the individual working groups to use
   this information as they see fit, but one result might be the
   preferential treatment of documents resulting in them being processed
   more rapidly.

   The process in this document is offered as an experiment.  Authors of
   Internet-Drafts are encouraged to consider using the process for
   their documents, and working groups are invited to think about
   applying the process to all of their protocol specifications.

   The authors of this document intend to collate experiences with this
   experiment and to report them to the community.

2.  The "Implementation Status" Section

   Each Internet-Draft may contain a section entitled "Implementation
   Status".  This section, if it appears, should be located just before
   the "Security Considerations" section and contain, for each existing
   implementation:

   o  The implementation's name and/or a link to a web page describing
      the implementation.
   o  A brief general description.
   o  The implementation's level of maturity: alpha, beta, production,
      or widely used.
   o  Coverage: which parts of the protocol specification are
      implemented and which versions of the Internet-Draft were
      implemented.
   o  Licensing: whether the implementation is closed source, shareware,
      or open source.

   In addition, this section can contain information about the
   interoperability of any or all of the implementations.

   Since this information is necessarily time-dependent, the authors
   should remove this section when the I-D is published as an RFC.


3.  Alternative Formats

   Sometimes it can be an advantage to publish the implementation status
   separately from the base Internet Draft, e.g. on the IETF wiki:

   o  When the Implementation Status section becomes too large to be
      conveniently managed within the document.
   o  When a working group decides to have implementors, rather than
      authors, keep the status of their implementations current.
   o  When a working group already maintains an active wiki and prefers
      to use it for this purpose.

   It is highly important that all readers of the Internet Draft should
   be made aware of this information.  Initially this can be done by
   replacing the Implementation Status section with a URL pointing to
   the wiki.  Later, the IETF Tools may support this functionality, e.g.
   by including such a link from the HTMLized draft version, similarly
   to the IPR link.

   The implementation status information must be publicly available, in
   line with general IETF policy.

4.  Benefits

   Publishing the information about implementations provides the working
   group with several benefits:

   o  Participants are motivated to implement protocol proposals, which
      helps in discovering protocol flaws at an early stage.
   o  Other participants can use the software, to evaluate the
      usefulness of protocol features.
   o  WG members may choose to perform interoperability testing with
      known implementations, especially when they are publicly
      available.
   o  In the case of open source, people may want to study the code to
      better understand the protocol and its limitations.
   o  Working group chairs and ADs may use the information provided to
      help prioritize the progress of I-Ds in some way [I-D.farrell-ft].
   o  And lastly, some protocol features may be hard to understand, and
      for such features, the mere assurance that they can be implemented
      is beneficial.

   We do not specify here whether and to what degree working groups are
   expected to prefer proposals that have "running code" associated with
   them, over others that do not.


5.  Process Experiment

   The current proposal is proposed as an experiment.  The inclusion of
   "Implementation Status" sections in Internet-Drafts is not mandatory,
   but the authors of this document wish to encourage authors of other
   Internet-Drafts to try out this simple process to discover whether it
   is useful.  Working group chairs are invited to suggest this process
   to document editors in their working groups, and to draw the
   attention of their working group participants to "Implementation
   Status" sections where they exist.

   Following a community discussion, it was concluded that [RFC3933] is
   not an appropriate framework for this experiment, primarily because
   no change is required to any existing process.

5.1.  Duration

   Given the typical time to produce an RFC (see [stats]), we propose a
   duration of 18 months for the experiment.  Thus, 18 months after the
   date of initial posting of this document, the authors will report on
   the experiment as described in the next section.

5.2.  Summary Report

   The authors will summarize the results of the experiment at the end
   of the period assigned to the experiment (see Section 5.1).  If
   nothing happens (no I-Ds or only a handful include an "Implementation
   Status" section), an email to the IETF list will be sufficient.  This
   would obviously constitute a failure to adopt the idea and the
   authors will abandon the experiment.

   If this idea is adopted by document authors, a summary I-D will be
   written containing the statistics of such adoption, as well as
   (necessarily subjective) reports by working group chairs and area
   directors who have used this mechanism.

   The authors may then propose more wide-scale use of the process and
   might suggest more formal adoption of the process by the IETF.

5.3.  Success Criteria

   The goal of this experiment is to improve the quality of IETF
   specifications.  This is impossible to quantify, of course.  We
   suggest that generally positive answers to the following questions
   would indicate that the experiment was successful:

   o  Did the working group make decisions that were more informed when
      comparing multiple competing solutions for the same work item?
   o  Did authors significantly modify proposed protocols based on
      implementation experience?
   o  Did disclosure of implementations encourage more interoperability
      testing than previously?
   o  Did non-authors review documents based on interactions with
      running code and/or inspection of the code itself?
   o  Did the experiment result in toy implementations, aimed at
      "gaining points" at the IETF, or were they real and useful?


6.  Implementation Status

   This is a process document and therefore does not have any meaningful
   implementation status.  "Implementation" in the context of this
   document means actual program code.


7.  Security Considerations

   This is a process document and therefore, it does not have a direct
   effect on the security of any particular IETF protocol.  Better
   reviewed protocols are likely to also be more secure.
