Abstract

   When a local LAN running spanning tree protocol connecting to TRILL
   campus via more than one RBridge, there are several ways to perform
   loop avoidance. One of them illustrated by RFC6325 [RFC6325] A.3 was
   to make relevant ports on edge RBridges involving in spanning tree
   calculation. When edge RBridges are emulated as a single highest
   priority root, the local bridged LAN will be naturally partitioned
   after running spanning tree protocol. This approach achieves better
   link utilization and intra-VLAN load balancing in some scenarios.
   This document describes how the edge RBridges react to topology
   change occurring in bridged LAN in order to make the abovementioned
   spanning tree approach function correct.

1. Introduction

   The TRILL protocol [RFC6325] provides the appointed forwarder
   mechanism [RFC6439] for loop avoidance where, for part of the loop,
   the frame would be in TRILL encapsulated format, for example in the
   scenario shown by Figure 1. Only one of the RBridges is responsible
   for encapsulating/decapsulating a given VLAN's data frames on a link.
   Bridges in the local bridged LAN runs normal spanning tree protocol
   for local loop avoidance. RBridges keeps track of the root bridge by
   listening to BPDUs received on the local port. This information is
   reported per VLAN by the RBridge in its LSP and is used to detect a
   root bridge change. Root bridge changes trigger the reset of the
   inhibition timer of the appointed forwarder. When an RBridge ceases
   to be appointed forwarder for a VLAN on a port, it sends topology
   change BPDUs to purge the MAC table on local bridged LAN switches.
   An RBridge conformable to [RFC6325] never encapsulates or forwards
   any BPDU frame it receives.

   [RFC6325] A.2 & A.3 presented the problems using the conventional
   approach shown in Figure 1. Native frames enter and leave a link via
   the link's appointed forwarder for the VLAN of the frame can cause
   congestion or suboptimal routing. Four methods was illustrated in
   [RFC6325] to solve the problem,

   1. Use RBridge instead of conventional bridge

   2. Re-arrange network topology

   3. Carefully select the different appointed forwarders for VLANs if
      end stations on local bridged LAN can be separated into multiple
      VLANs

   4. Configure the RBridges to be like one STP tree root in local
      bridged LAN. The RBridge ports that are connected to the bridged
      LAN send spanning tree configuration BPDUs. Then the bridged LAN
      is forced into partitions. Figure 2 shows its network topology.

   Method 1 and 2 highly depends on the network topology and equipment
   types and therefore have very limited applicability. Method 3 and 4
   have broader applicability. Method 4 is more applicable than method
   3 if all end stations in bridged LAN are on the same VLAN or intra
   VLAN load balancing is required to avoid per VLAN congestion and
   suboptimal routing. The traffic discontinuity was caused by
   inhibition timer setting in case of root change in method 3. Proper
   timeout value has to be carefully chosen for tradeoff between
   unnecessary traffic continuity and potential loop. Method 4
   eliminates the requirement of setting inhibition timer in case of
   root change.  Therefore method 4 is considered as a very common
   practice in real deployment.

              Figure 2 RBs function as STP tree root topology



1.1. Motivations

   Bridged LANs may have topology changes at any time. When RB1 & RB2
   serve as one single STP tree root as shown in Figure 2, it is
   required that RB1 and RB2 have to tunnel some BPDUs to help the
   bridged LAN convergence in certain circumstances. Figure 2 will be
   used to illustrate such motivation for rest of this subsection.

   RB1 & RB2 use the same bridge ID to emit spanning tree BPDUs as the
   highest priority root Bx. All bridges in LAN see RB1 and RB2 as a
   single tree root. Therefore B1-B2 and B2-B3 links are blocked for
   loop avoidance by the spanning tree protocol. RB1 and RB2 will not
   receive TRILL-Hello from each other. Bridged LAN is logically
   partitioned into two parts. RB1 is DRB and AF for all VLANs in left
   partition and RB2 is DRB and AF in right partition.

   If B1-B3 link fails for some reason, alternate port p2 on B3 will
   send topology change (TC) BPDU to B2 as RSTP specifies [802.1D]. B2-
   B3 link will start forwarding frames. TC BPDU is then sent from B2
   to RB2. As RB2 never forwards BPDU frame to TRILL campus, left
   partition has no way to know the topology change. Therefore B4 will
   not able to correctly purge the MACs learnt from port p1 for end
   stations connected to B3. MAC table entry aging is the last resort
   in this case. In addition, a remote end station may keep sending
   traffic to an end station connected to B3 via RB1-B1 which causes
   frame loss. Therefore some mechanism must be introduced to purge the
   MACs learned both in the left partition of the bridged LAN and at
   the remote Rbridges when topology changes.

   This draft proposes to use RBridge channel [TRILLChannel] to tunnel
   the TC BPDU to solve the issue. It complements Appendix A.3 of
   RFC6325 to improve correctness and efficiency.

4.1. Sending BPDU using RBridge channel

   In figure 4, when B1-B3 link fails, alternate port p2 on B3 will
   start to send TC BPDU and go to forwarding state. RB2 receives TC
   BPDU from B2 sequentially. RB2 encapsulates the TC BPDU in RBridge
   channel and sends it to RB1.

   Interested VLANs and Spanning Tree Roots Sub-TLV [RFC6326] carries
   spanning tree root bridge IDs seen for all ports for which the
   RBridge is the appointed forwarder for a VLAN. As RB1 and RB2 use
   the same bridge ID and that bridge ID is the spanning tree root, RB1
   and RB2 are considered as in a root bridge group. Static
   configuration of root bridge group is also allowed.

   When RBridge receives TC BPDU from an access port, it tunnels the
   frame to all the other RBridges in the same root bridge group using
   RBridge channel protocol specified in section 3. Normally the number
   of RBridges in a root bridge group is limited, say 2 or 3; such
   tunneling is performed using TRILL unicast encapsulation. N members
   in a root bridge group results in N-1 sequential unicast BPDU
   tunneled. In figure 4, RB2 knows RB1 is in the same root bridge
   group from LSP exchange; hence RB2 uses RB1's nickname as egress
   nickname and encapsulates the TC BPDU in RBridge channel. M bit in
   TRILL header SHOULD be 0.

   If TRILL Campus was partitioned temporarily in some unusual cases,
   RBridges in the same root bridge group may not reach each other. For
   instance, if RB2 was not able to reach RB1 through TRILL campus at
   some transition period due to network fault, RB1 would not receive
   the tunneled TC BPDU from RB2. Then the approach illustrated in this
   document will take effect again only after RB1 and RB2 connectivity
   via TRILL recovers from the network fault.

   It is possible to statically configure a root bridge group, especial
   when network is relatively small and stable. Therefore when an
   RBridge tunnels the TC BPDU to other members in the same root bridge
   group, it has to make sure the destination is reachable.

   If edges RBridges configured in the same root bridge group connect
   to separate TRILL campus intentionally, it is not recommended to use
   spanning tree partition mechanism and such root bridge group
   provisioning is normally considered as mis-configuration.

4.2. Receiving BPDU in RBridge channel

   When an RBridge receives a TC BPDU from RBridge channel, it
   determines the frame was sent from an RB in the same root bridge
   group. Then RBridge decapsulates the frame and sends the original TC
   BPDU to its local bridged LAN. TC BPDU will be flooded throughout
   the access ports configured as the same domain ID specified by BPDU
   RBridge channel in the left partition to purge MAC table of bridges.

4.3. Informing the remote site

   When local topology changes, the correspondence of end station and
   its attaching RBridge cached by remote RB may become invalid. The
   RBridges who is the appointed forwarder for the specified VLAN in
   remote sites should be informed to update the stale correspondence
   table entry.

   When traffic is bi-directional, the remote RBridge will receive the
   data frames from the newly attached RBridge of the local end station.
   The remote RBridge will update its MAC-Nickname correspondence table
   naturally though data frame learning.

   When traffic is uni-directional from the remote to local site or
   traffic from local to remote has to be triggered by traffic from
   remote to local, remote RBridge will not receive the data frame from
   local RBridge to refresh its table. Then traffic discontinuity may
   last for some time until the table entry is aged out at the remote
   RBridge.

   A lightweight method is to use RBridge channel to carry MAC purge
   information. In Figure 4, When RB2 receives TC BPDU from B2, it
   derives the corresponding VLAN list. For example, if MSTP is used,
   RB2 will get the VLAN IDs in the same MSTP instance as TC BPDU. RB2
   sends out MAC purge information using RBridge channel with VLAN
   information and RBidges' nicknames in the same root bridge group.
   All remote RBridges received MAC purge should clear its MAC-to-
   nickname correspondence table for entries with the specified
   nicknames and VLAN IDs. If no VLAN list is specified, the remote
   RBridges should clear the correspondence in all VLANs relevant to
   the given nicknames. The MAC purge is recommended to send on the
   management VLAN in which all RBridges joins.

   A new channel protocol code for MAC purge should be defined as
   follows.

   Number of nicknames: number of the following nicknames, which will
   be used by the receivers to purge their relevant MAC-to-nickname
   correspondence table entries.

   Num of VLAN blocks: number of the following VLAN block. A VLAN block
   is specified by a start and an end VLAN IDs. When start and end VLAN
   IDs are the same, it implies only one VLAN ID is in the block. When
   number of VLAN block is 0, it implies no VLAN ID is specified.

   For any nickname x specified and any VLAN y specified in this TLV,
   the receivers should purge MAC-to-nickname correspondence table
   entries with (any-MAC, VLAN-y, nickname-x). When number of VLAN
   block is 0, the receivers should purge entries with (any-MAC, any-
   VLAN, nickname-x).

   Authentication Information TLV specified by section 3.2 can be used
   in MAC Purge channel message.

5. Security Considerations

   This document does not change the general RBridge security
   considerations of the TRILL base protocol and TRILL RBridge Channel.
   See Section 6 of [RFC6325] and section 7 of [TRILLChannel].

   Massive TC BPDU may trigger RBridges continuously sending tunneled
   BPDU and MAC purges. It may cause denial-of-service in TRILL campus.
   Similar as the traditional bridged LAN running spanning tree, it is
   suggested to monitor the receiving rate of TC BPDU on bridged LAN
   facing port of RBridges. If the receiving rate is beyond the
   threshold, RBridge should only process and tunnel the TC BPDU in the
   configured rate.

   Authentication TLV should be included if risk of injecting forged
   information is a concern. However keeping channel information in
   this document secret and private is not necessary and is not a
   requirement.

6. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate the new channel protocol codes as
   following.

   Channel protocol code X1: BPDU

   Channel protocol code X2: MAC purge

   BPDU TLV type:

   Authentication Information TLV type:
