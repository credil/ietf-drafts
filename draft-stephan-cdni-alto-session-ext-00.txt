Abstract

   The selection of a downstream CDN by an upstream CDN is based on
   multi-dimensional criteria such as the number of hops, the
   performance of the connections between the user-agent and downstream
   CDNs and the availability of downstream CDNs resources.  Various
   protocols, such as BGP or ALTO, may be used by an upstream CDN to
   collect footprints and interconnection preferences of downstream
   CDNs.  This draft introduces several extensions to the ALTO protocol
   for CDN interconnection.

Internet-Draft            CDNi ALTO extensions                March 2012


1.  Introduction

   The selection of a downstream CDN by an upstream CDN is based on
   multi-dimensional criteria such as the number of hops, the
   performance of the connections between the user-agent and downstream
   CDNs and the availability of downstream CDNs resources.  Various
   protocols, such as BGP or ALTO, may be used by an upstream CDN to
   collect footprints and interconnection preferences of downstream
   CDNs.  This draft introduces several extensions to the ALTO protocol
   for CDN interconnection.

   This draft focuses on the CDNi interconnections between an upstream
   CDN and a set of downstream CDNs willing to control the exposition
   and the exchange of footprint information.

   It applies to CDNi use cases ([I-D.ietf-cdni-use-cases]) and CDN use
   cases ( [I-D.jenkins-alto-cdn-use-cases]).

1.1.  Terminology

   The reader must be familiar with the terminology given by the drafts
   [I-D.ietf-cdni-problem-statement], and [I-D.ietf-cdni-requirements] ,
   and [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol].

   The following abbreviations are recalled:

      - dCDN : downstream CDN;

      - uCDN : upstream CDN;

      - PID : Provider-defined Network Location Identifier;

      - NSP : Network Service Provider (e.g.  ISP connecting End User to
      Internet);

   ALTO Client-Server session:

   The logical association between an ALTO Client and an ALTO server
   which maintains the context across the connections of the client to
   the server.


2.  Motivations

   Currently the ALTO protocol is designed for the communication of
   network information to internet applications including untrusted
   ones.  In the context of a CDN interconnection (CDNi) there is a
   certain level of trust, at least enough to mount a subset of the

   interfaces depicted in [I-D.ietf-cdni-problem-statement].  There are
   CDNi situations like Inter-Affiliates Interconnection (see section
   2.2 [I-D.ietf-cdni-use-cases] where topology hiding [RFC5693] is not
   absolutely required.

2.1.  ALTO Client-Server session

   ALTO is a client-server protocol.  Currently the ALTO specifications
   do not specify the parameters of the session.
   [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol] only indicates concerns for authentication,
   content protection and encryption.  Cookies are ignored.

   The configuration of the ALTO interface between an uCDN and a dCDN
   requires the exchange of session parameters between the two CDNs
   operators.  This can be performed either out-of-band or through the
   CDNi Control interface.  In both cases the setting of a CDNi ALTO
   session requires an agreement between the 2 CDNs operators and a
   technical description of the session configuration (addresses, URL,
   authentication methods, etc.), of the information which can be
   exchanged (PID filtering, level of details of the maps) and on the
   way the information is exchanged (update procedure, scale of time of
   the update ).

2.2.  PID Stability

   Currently to mitigate the risks of providing ALTO information to
   untrusted ALTO clients ( [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol], section 12.1), it
   is usual to ALTO servers to scramble the prefixes among the PIDs to
   avoid reverse engineering.  This may lead to PID content overlapping.
   Such nondeterministic semantics may be unusable by a request routing
   function of a uCDN, or may lead to suboptimal decision. .

2.3.  Scalability

   As illustrated by the figure 1 an uCDN could be interconnected with
   several dCDNs.  It may receive an important amount of information
   leading to the uCDN failure ([I-D.ietf-alto-deployments], section
   10).  The CDNi ALTO interface should provide a scalable information
   exchange framework to match uCDN ALTO client resources constraints.
   A dCDN should be able to dimension the information resources it
   dedicates to uCDNs.  For instance, an uCDN may not want to receive
   the very last detailed level of the network map of all the dCDNs it
   is interconnected with; similarly it may not want to receive all the
   update information.

   This will be even worse when the maps will include multi-cost (
   [I-D.randriamasy-alto-multi-cost] and [I-D.marocco-alto-next] section
   3.2).

2.4.  dCDN Traffic Optimization

   Considering that ALTO is about traffic optimization at the
   application level, in the context of a CDNi interconnection between
   an uCDN and a dCDN, ALTO is capable of covering the exchange of
   information from dCDN to uCDN, allowing for the optimization of the
   delivery at the uCDN side only.  In contrast, exchanging information
   the other way around for allowing delivery optimization at the dCDN
   level is not addressed yet.

   Indeed a dCDN is subject to rival uCDNs requesting resources based on
   information exposed by the dCDN.  By exposing their constraints and
   their needs, the uCDNs requirements are better addressed by dCDNs
   through a smart resource provisioning and sharing.


3.  Proposal

3.1.  CDNi ALTO Session

   The session between uCDNs and dCDNs should reflect the agreements and
   expectancies between them.  A minimal configuration of the session is
   required for ensuring an efficient initialization of the interface,
   for decreasing the service time, increasing the interoperability and
   improving the security.

   Interoperability:

   The session configuration parameters must avoid the case allowed in
   section 7.6.3 of [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol] where several entries in

Internet-Draft            CDNi ALTO extensions                March 2012


   the directory match an Information Resource using a HTTP POST or a
   HTTP GET.  Additional session parameters should be specified to avoid
   such situations (see section 7.6.4.1of [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol]).

   One proposal consists in including PID filters in the session
   parameters: The dCDN ALTO server generates an URI entry for each of
   these filters in the resource directory.  The uCDN ALTO client
   downloads the content attached to these URIs using HTTP GET queries.

   Discussion:

   This work on the session configuration may be coupled with the
   specification of the update service [I-D.marocco-alto-next] as both
   require the memorization of session parameters like the coordinates
   of the dCDN ALTO clients.

3.2.  PID stability with legacy BGP

   As described in section 4.1of
   [I-D.previdi-cdni-footprint-advertisement] a CDN acquires most of the
   footprint information from legacy BGP.  The NSP may use part of the
   community tags carried by its legacy internal BGP to filter and
   gather the prefixes in stable groups (see section 5.1.7 of
   [I-D.ietf-alto-deployments]) that may then used by its internal CDN
   [I-D.jenkins-alto-cdn-use-cases] .  The NSP CDN acting as a dCDN ALTO
   server may filter and send these stable groups to uCDN ALTO clients
   according to its policies and with respect to the peering agreement
   between The NSP CDN and each uCDN.

3.3.  Interface Scalability

   The ALTO data must be customized to reduce the amount of exchanged
   information for scalability and responsiveness.

3.3.1.  PIDs filters Setting

   The amount of information to be parsed impacts directly the
   performance of uCDN Request Routing function.  The selection of the
   PIDs of interest is needed by an uCDN to limit the quantity of
   information to download from each dCDN.  As an example an uCDN does
   not want to download all the PIDs when it needs only the PIDs managed
   directly by each dCDN NSP (e.g. user-agent IPv4 on-net prefixes).

   Discussion:

   As given by section 7.2.2. of [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol] this can
   already be achieved using POST querying the ALTO Map Filtering
   Service.  The drawback is that it requires carrying the filter

Internet-Draft            CDNi ALTO extensions                March 2012


   parameters in-band in each POST query.  An uCDN should be able to
   configure filters that apply during all the duration of the ALTO
   connection and to have the resulting information addressable directly
   through a simple GET of an URI in the dCDN ALTO server.

   The proposal consists in having PID filters at the session level.
   There are two options:

      The filters are agreed by uCDN and dCDN operators and set in the
      configuration of the session;

      Filters are dynamically configured during the session by an uCDN
      ALTO client.  It requires the creation of a 'PIDs filters Setting'
      service in the dCDN ALTO server.

3.3.2.  PIDs Summary

   The level of information details exchanged between a dCDN ALTO server
   and a uCDN ALTO client must be customizable in order to decrease the
   amount of exchanged data while providing the required information.

   uCDN may not need the full details of each map.  It may also need to
   reduce the exchange of useless information.  An uCDN ALTO client
   should be allowed to get only the summary of the maps.  This can be
   achieved by using additional session parameters giving the level of
   detail of the maps.

   This covers the situation where the very detail of PIDs are available
   on other existing interfaces of a dCDN and where an uCDN and a dCDN
   agree to not duplicate the works.

3.3.3.  PID Details

   An uCDN may need the detailed information of a sub set of PIDs of
   interest.

   An uCDN ALTO client queries the detail of a PID in dCDN ALTO server
   using the ALTO Map Filtering Service [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol].

3.3.4.  Incremental Updates

   In a way to avoid flooding uCDN with useless information each dCDN
   ALTO server should limit the incremental update according to the
   session configuration and the restrictions made by each uCDN ALTO
   client (filters, time scale, etc.).

3.4.  dCDN traffic Optimization

   An uCDN may provide dCDN with high level constraints like previsions
   of the amount of traffic that uCDN will or may have to deliver.
   Based on the raw description of each uCDN constraints, dCDN NSPs
   should be able to improve their network provisioning and optimize
   resource usage while enhancing the QoS.  This benefits directly to
   all uCDNs because the cost map provided by dCDN will reflect uCDNs
   constraints instead of providing a better-than-nothing generic cost
   map agnostic to the different uCDNs constraints.  To preserve its
   know-how an uCDN is not entitled to expose the detail of its
   constraints.  The solution proposed by this draft consists in
   grouping uCDN constraints information at the PID level to provide
   complementary information on the PIDs provided by dCDN.

   This information benefits to all interconnected CDNs as it allows for
   a smarter resources utilization leading to a better QoE at comparable
   costs.

   This can be achieved with a new ALTO Service based on a POST request.


4.  Framework

   The framework is PID centric.  It supports session parameters.  It
   reduces the number of POST messages by including fully-defined
   filtered maps as URI in the resource directory and provides better
   scalability regarding the amount of data to clients and servers.  It
   adds a first service allowing uCDN to configure filters which apply
   to all uCDN queries and dCDN updates.  The second service created
   allows uCDNs to complement PID information with high level
   constraints.  The third service, already in the roadmap of ALTO,
   allows the push of map updates by an ALTO server.

   Following is the summary of the services.

   (a) The uCDN ALTO client gets the dCDN ALTO server capabilities (GET
   directory).

   (b) The uCDN ALTO client adds PIDs filtering (e.g.  IPv4 only, PID of
   interest ...).

   (c) The uCDN ALTO client downloads PIDs summary.

   (d) The uCDN ALTO client downloads detailed information of one PID.

   (e) The uCDN ALTO client complements dCDN network map entries with
   its constraints.

   (f) The uCDN ALTO client downloads the cost map.

   (g) The dCDN ALTO server updates the information.  An update includes
   either the information that has changed or a list of indication of
   the information which has changed.  The mode used is given by the
   session parameters.  As an example, an update of the network map may
   includes only the list of the PID updated since the previous version
   of the network map.


5.  Requirements

   This section proposes a first set of requirements.

   Requirements for ALTO:

   The ALTO server must indicate the support of the CDNi services in its
   Information resource Directory:

      - CDNi PID filtering service;

      - Constraints upload service;

      - Update service;

   Requirements for CDNi:

   A dCDN ALTO server must reject any message received from an untrusted
   CDNi uCDN ALTO client.

   A dCDN ALTO server must support the filter setting service when the
   initialization of the session does not support PID filters
   configuration.

   A dCDN ALTO server must support the exchange of summarized network
   maps.

   A dCDN ALTO server may support the constraints upload service.

   A dCDN ALTO server may support the update service.

   A uCDN ALTO client may support the update service.

6.  Information Service Specification

   This section specifies the session initialization and the additionnal
   information services defined for interconnecting an uCDN ALTO client
   to an dCDN ALTO server.

   Each information service will be described in a next version of this
   document.

6.1.  Session Initialization

   The agreement between uCDN and dCDN operators specifies the initial
   values of the parameters of the ALTO sessions.

   Following are the parameters of the session:

      - PID_filters: The list of PID filters of this session (e.g. ipv4,
      on-net...).

      - network_map_level_of_details: The default level of details of
      the network maps.

      - costmap_level_of_details: The default level of details of the
      cost maps.

      - Update_heartbeat: The time scale of the update.

6.2.  Update

   This is already drafted in [I-D.pbryan-json-patch], discussed
   [I-D.schwan-alto-incr-updates]and envisionned by
   [I-D.marocco-alto-next] the ALTO WG.


7.  Information Service Call Flows

   This section describes the interworking between a dCDN ALTO server
   and an uCDN ALTO client.

   The call flow of each service will be described in a next version of
   this document.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document will request the registration of the media type
   corresponding to each new information service introduced.

9.  Security Considerations

   [Editor Note: This section needs more works]

   Despite the ALTO session is set up between CDNi entities the usage of
   the ALTO services by the client may stress the server.  Consequently
   the volume and the number of these messages may affect the
   availability and the performance of the ALTO server.

   An uCDN ALTO client sets up the session parameters to control the
   amount of information downloaded from a dCDN ALTO server.
   Nevertheless the uCDN ALTO client should protect itself from the
   download of huge network map.

   The new information services do not introduce deep privacy concerns
   because they tend to reduce the information exchanged.  Nevertheless
   this point requires more investigation.
