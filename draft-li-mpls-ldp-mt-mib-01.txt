Internet-Draft             MIB for MPLS LDP MT                 July 2011


1.  Introduction

   There are increasing requirements to support multi-topology in MPLS
   network.  For example, service providers want to assign different
   level of service(s) to different topologies so that the service
   separation can be achieved.  It is also possible to have an in-band
   management network on top of the original MPLS topology, or maintain
   separate routing and MPLS domains for isolated multicast or IPv6
   islands within the backbone, or force a subset of an address space to
   follow a different MPLS topology for the purpose of security, QoS or
   simplified management and/or operations.

   For a detailed overview of the multi topology, please refer to
   draft-zhao-mpls-ldp-multi-topology-01.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410[RFC3410] .  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual
   information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
   MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network
   Management Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the
   mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2,
   which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578[RFC2578], STD 58, RFC
   2579[RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580[RFC2580]


3.  Overview of MT-MPLS-STD-MIB objects

   The following subsections describe the purpose of each of the objects
   contained in the MT-MPLS-STD-MIB.

   3.1.  MPLS LDP MT Entity Table

   The mplsLdpEntityTable specificed in [RFC3815] is used to configure
   information which is used by the LDP protocol to setup potential LDP
   Sessions.  The mplsLdpMtEntityTable can be considered as an extention
   to mplsLdpEntityTable to setup potential LDP MT Sessions.

   Each entry/row in this table represents a single LDP MT Entity.
   There is no maximum number of LDP MT Entities specified.  However,
   there is an mplsLdpMtEntityIndexNext object which should be retrieved
   by the command generator prior to creating an LDP MT Entity.  If the
   mplsLdpMtEntityIndexNext object is zero, this indicates that the LSR/
   LER is not able to create another LDP MT Entity at that time.

Internet-Draft             MIB for MPLS LDP MT                 July 2011


   3.2.  MPLS LDP MT Session Table

   Since all the MT related label messages can be advertised by LDP
   Sessions in default topology, there is no need to create extra tcp
   connection for Multi Topology.

   The mplsLdpMtSessionTable is a read-only table.  Each entry in this
   table represents an MT Session which is related to one or more LDP MT
   Entities and only one LDP Session in default topology.

   3.3.  MPLS LDP MT LSP Table

   The Label Information Base (LIB) contains information about labels
   learned by the LSR.  The LIB for LDP and MPLS-RSVP (i.e., all
   currently defined MPLS protocols) is represented in the LSR MIB
   [RFC3813].  The LIB is represented by the LSR MIB's mplsXCTable (mpls
   Cross Connect Table), mplsInSegmentTable (mpls In Segment Table) and
   the mplsOutSegmentTable (mpls Out Segment Table).  The mplsXCTable
   models the cross-connection of the incoming label with a specific
   outgoing label.

   In Multi Topology network, the MT-ID TLV can be inserted into the
   following LDP messages as an optional parameter during LDP
   advertisement, including the following message:

   Label Mapping "Label Mapping Message"

   Label Request "Label Request Message"

   Label Abort Request "Label Abort Request Message"

   Label Withdraw "Label Withdraw Message"

   Label Release "Label Release Message"

   The message with inserted MT-ID TLV associates a FEC in same message
   to the topology identified by MT-ID.

   3.4.  MT statistics Table

   MTStatisticsTable is a read-only table which contains statistical
   information related to packet passing through the LSP under the
   topology.  The statistical information includes packets total counts,
   delay, jitter and so on.

   3.5 MPLS LDP MT Notifications

   The mplsLdpMtSessionUp and mplsLdpMtSessionDown notifications are

   generated when there is an appropriate change in the
   mplsLdpMtSessionState object, e.g., when sessions change state (Up to
   Down for the mplsLdpMtSessionDown notification, or Down to Up for the
   mplsLdpMtSessionUp notification).

   needs to be removed from the MIB.  (This implies that the network
