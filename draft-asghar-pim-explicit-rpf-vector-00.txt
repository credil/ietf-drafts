1.  Introduction

   In some applications it might be useful to have a way to specify
   the explicit path along which the PIM join is propagated.      

   This document defines a new TLV in the PIM Join Attribute message 
   [RFC5384] for specifying the explicit path.

   The procedures in [RFC5496] define how a RPF vector can be used 
   to influence the path selection in the absence of a route to the 
   Source. However, the same procedures can be used to override a 
   route to the Source when it exists. It is possible to include 
   multiple RPF vectors in the stack where each router along the 
   path will perform a unicast route lookup on the first vector in 
   the attribute list. Once the router owning the address of the RPF 
   vector is reached, following the procedures in [RFC5496], the RPF
   vector will be removed from the attribute list. This will result 
   in a 'loosely' routed path based on the unicast reachability of 
   the RPF vector(s). We call this loosely because we still depend 
   on unicast routing reachability to the RPF Vector.

   In some scenario's we don't want to rely on the unicast
   reachability to the RPF vector address and we want to build a 
   path strictly based on the RPF vectors. In that case the RPF 
   vector(s) represent a list of directly connected PIM neighbors 
   along the path. For these vectors we MUST NOT do a unicast route
   lookup. We call these 'explicit' RPF vector addresses. If a 
   router receiving an explicit RPF vector does not have a PIM 
   neighbor matching the explicit RPF vector address it MUST NOT 
   fall back to loosely routing the JOIN. Since the behavior of 
   the explicit RPF vector differs from the loose RPF vector as 
   defined [RFC5496], we're defining a new attribute called the 
   explicit RPF Vector.


2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL"
   "NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described 
   in [RFC2119].


3. Use of the PIM Explicit RPF Vector
 
   Normally PIM builds a receiver driven multicast forwarding tree 
   by sending PIM Joins from the leaf router towards root based on 
   unicast route lookup to source. 

   Figure 1 provides an example multicast join path R4->R3->R2->R1,
   where the forwarding states are installed hop-by-hop dynamically.
  
 
           <--- (S,G) Join ---
   [S]---(R1)--(R2)---(R3)--(R4)---[R]
                 |      |
                 |      |
               (R5)---(R6)

                  Figure 1

   Figure 2 provides an example multicast join path R4->R3->R6->R5->R2->R1, 
   where the multicast JOIN is explicitly routed to the source hop-by-hop 
   using the explicit RPF vector list.

          <---   |      |  ---
             |   |      |  |

4. Explicit RPF Vector Attribute 
 
   This draft uses vector attribute 1 for specifying an explicit rpf 
   vector. 


5.  Explicit RPF Vector Attribute TLV Format

   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |F|S| Type      | Length        |        Value
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-.......

   F bit
   -----
   Forward Unknown TLV. If this bit is set the TLV is forwarded
   regardless of whether the router understands the Type. If the TLV
   is known the F bit is ignored.

   S bit
   -----
   Bottom of Stack. If this bit is set then this is the last
   TLV in the stack.

   Type
   ----
   The Vector Attribute type is 1.

   Length
   ------
   Length depending on Address Family of Encoded-Unicast address.

   Value
   -----
   Encoded-Unicast address.


6. Interoperability 

    The behaviour is dictated by the F flag as specified in RFC 5496. 


7.  IANA Considerations

   An new attribute type from the "PIM Join Attribute Types" registry
   needs to be assigned by IANA for the RPF Vector.  The proposed
   value is 1.


8.  Security Considerations

   Security of the RPF Vector Attribute is only guaranteed by the
   security of the PIM packet, so the security considerations for PIM
   join packets as described in PIM-SM [RFC4601] apply here.
