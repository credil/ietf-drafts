           Usage of NTP for the PDM DOH IPv6 Extension Header
                draft-ackermann-tictoc-pdm-ntp-usage-00

Abstract

   The Performance and Diagnostic Metrics (PDM) Destination Options
   Header (DOH) for IPv6 defines metrics which are critical for timely
   end-to-end problem resolution, without impacting an operational
   production network. These metrics and their derivations can be used
   for network diagnostics. The base metrics are: packet sequence number
   and packet timestamp. The timestamp fields require time
   synchronization at the two end points. This document provides
   implementation guidelines for implementing Network Time Protocol
   (NTP) to provide such synchronization.

1  Background

   The Performance and Diagnostic Metrics (PDM) Destination Options
   Header (DOH) for IPv6 [RFC2460] defines metrics which are critical
   for timely end-to-end problem resolution, without impacting an
   operational production network.  These metrics and their derivations
   can be used for network diagnostics.  The base metrics are: packet
   sequence number and packet timestamp. The timestamp fields require
   time synchronization at the two end points. 

   This document provides implementation guidelines for implementing
   Network Time Protocol (NTP) [RFC5905] to provide such
   synchronization.  If these guidelines are followed, accuracies at a
   minimum of 100 milliseconds, or better, should be achievable
   throughout the network.  

   For background, please see draft-elkins-6man-ipv6-pdm-dest-option-02
   [ELKPDM], draft-elkins-v6ops-ipv6-packet-sequence-needed-01 [ELKPSN],
   draft-elkins-v6ops-ipv6-pdm-recommended-usage-01 [ELKUSE], draft-
   elkins-v6ops-ipv6-end-to-end-rt-needed-01 [ELKRSP] and draft-elkins-
   ippm-pdm-metrics-00 [ELKIPPM]. These drafts are companions to this
   document.   


1.1 General Implementation Guidelines

   This recommendation provides technical requirements, guidelines and
   parameters that, if followed, will enable organizations to implement
   a NTP environment successfully.  Each entity should choose and
   implement the products, architecture, protocols and configurations
   that best address their specific requirements and environment, while
   achieving the minimum requirements as outlined.

   In general, this will require a clocking hub with accuracies of 10
   milliseconds or better.  Where possible, subordinate servers and
   workstations should operate at stratum 4 or better (e.g., 3, 2 or 1).
   Servers should define at least three clock reference sources (if
   possible) at the same or better stratum for maximum availability,
   diversity and redundancy.

   Each clocking hub should include at least three stratum 1 (primary)
   or stratum 2 (secondary) servers as clock reference sources.  A
   primary server is synchronized to an external timing source (e.g., a
   GPS receiver, WWVB radio, NIST modem service).  A secondary server is
   synchronized to one or more primary servers (e.g., internal server,
   Internet server).

   Each primary and secondary server defined in the clocking hub should

INTERNET DRAFT     -ackermann-tictoc-pdm-ntp-usage-00       October 2013


   have at least three timing paths to other servers with preference in
   order of:  (a) on the local intranet; (b) the Internet at large; or
   (c) on another entity network.  This order of preference is based on
   performance, stability and security.  At least one of these paths
   should be to a server outside the local network.  This will provide
   diversity and redundancy, which is critical in a successful NTP
   implementation.

   NTP implementations should be version 4 where possible, practical and
   supported by the pertinent platform vendor.  Version 3
   implementations are considered acceptable at this time.

   The preferred NTP operating software is the standard NTP code, which
   is publicly available.  The standard code is natively provided in
   most Unix operating systems (e.g., Solaris, AIX).  The Windows
   operating system natively provides proprietary NTP software, which
   operates acceptably, but the more effective method is to download the
   standard NTP code and install/operate it on the required Windows
   platform(s).  If a Windows platform is acting as a clocking hub for
   non-Windows devices, it is highly recommended that the standard NTP
   code be used on the Windows platform acting as the hub.

   By default, Windows servers and workstations will use proprietary
   protocols to receive clock from the controlling AD server.  If the
   controlling AD server is using NTP to clock to primary or secondary
   NTP servers, the overall configuration should be operating
   acceptably.  Therefore, a viable alternative at the present time is
   to use the current Windows synchronization architecture with the AD
   server(s), synchronizing to multiple primary or secondary NTP
   servers.  It should be recognized that the crafted mitigation
   algorithms used in NTP may not be available in native Windows
   software.

1.2 NTP and IPPM

   RFC2330, Framework for IP Performance Metrics, [RFC2330] discusses a
   number of issues with clocking and NTP including drift, skew,
   resolution, etc.  We will not repeat these here but will refer the
   reader to that RFC for background.

1.3 Hierarchy

   Each entity should have a clocking hub that receives its clock from a
   Stratum one or better source.  This received clock should then be
   made available to every platform in the network, either directly or
   indirectly. Indirectly involves multiple levels of the hierarchy as
   depicted in the generic NTP architecture diagram (2.1). The clock is
   transported via NTP sessions which are Client/Server in nature. Note
 


Ackermann                 Expires April, 2014                   [Page 4]

INTERNET DRAFT     -ackermann-tictoc-pdm-ntp-usage-00       October 2013


   that for every additional hierarchal level, the received Stratum
   level (accuracy of the clock), is reduced, which means that the
   received clock is slightly less accurate.  

   NTP Client/Server Sessions can be connected in three basic fashions:
   
   1. Broadcast,
   2. Server,
   3. Peer.

   Our recommendation is to utilize server connections in most cases.  
   Broadcast is considered less stable, accurate and secure, but is
   still a viable option which requires less parameter definition at the
   client level. Peer sessions are a good solution when platforms are
   truly peer in the implemented hierarchy (e.g. dual Router Clocking
   Hubs).  

1.4 Architectural Principles

   Most of the architectural principals and objectives are described in
   section 1.1. Several of the salient concepts include:

   - Servers should define at least three clock reference sources (if
   possible) at the same or better stratum for maximum availability,
   diversity and redundancy.- DNS should be used at all levels.  In some
   situations Round Robin to achieve load balancing and
   redundancy.Redundancy should be used at all levels if possible. This
   may not be necessary with workstations.- Sessions between NTP Clients
   and NTP Servers will usually be point to point but can also be
   broadcast.    The recommendation of this document is to utilize point
   to point, because it is more stable, accurate and more secure.  - NTP
   sessions between the Client and the Server can be defined to run in
   "Authenticated Mode".   Utilizing NTP in Authenticated Mode allows a
   connected entity to assure that the NTP Server that clock is being
   received from the intended NTP Server and not an IP imposter.  
   "Shared Secret" keys, hashed using MD5, are used to authenticate the
   NTP sessions requested by NTP clients.
