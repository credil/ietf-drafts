                      PKIX over Secure HTTP (POSH)
                          draft-miller-posh-01

Abstract

   Experience has shown that it is extremely difficult to deploy proper
   PKIX certificates for TLS in multi-tenanted environments, since
   certification authorities will not issue certificates for hosted
   domains to hosting services, hosted domains do not want hosting
   services to hold their private keys, and hosting services wish to
   avoid liability for holding those keys.  As a result, domains hosted
   in multi-tenanted environments often deploy non-HTTP applications
   such as email and instant messaging using certificates that identify
   the hosting service, not the hosted domain.  Such deployments force
   end users and peer services to accept a certificate with an improper
   identifier, resulting in obvious security implications.  This
   document defines two methods that make it easier to deploy
   certificates for proper server identity checking in non-HTTP
   application protocols.  The first method enables the TLS client
   associated with a user agent or peer application server to obtain the
   end-entity certificate of a hosted domain over secure HTTP as an
   alternative to standard PKIX techniques.  The second method enables a
   hosted domain to securely delegate a non-HTTP application to a
   hosting service using redirects provided by HTTPS itself or by a
   pointer in a file served over HTTPS at the hosted domain.

1.  Introduction

   We start with a thought experiment.

   Imagine that you work on the operations team of a hosting company
   that provides the "foo" service (or email or instant messaging or
   social networking service) for ten thousand different customer
   organizations.  Each customer wants their service to be identified by
   the customer's domain name (e.g., foo.example.com), not the hosting
   company's domain name (e.g., hosting.example.net).

Internet-Draft                    POSH                    September 2013


   In order to properly secure each customer's "foo" service via
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246], you need to obtain PKIX
   certificates [RFC5280] containing identifiers such as
   foo.example.com, as explained in the "CertID" specification
   [RFC6125].  Unfortunately, you can't obtain such certificates
   because:

   o  Certification authorities won't issue such certificates to you
      because you work for the hosting company, not the customer
      organization.


   o  Customers won't obtain such certificates and then give them (plus
      the associated private keys) to you because their legal department
      is worried about liability.


   o  You don't want to install such certificates (plus the associated
      private keys) on your servers anyway because your legal department
      is worried about liability, too.

   Given your inability to deploy public keys / certificates containing
   the right identifiers, your back-up approach was always to use a
   certificate containing hosting.example.net as the identifier.
   However, more and more customers and end users are complaining about
   warning messages in user agents and the inherent security issues
   involved with taking a "leap of faith" to accept the identity
   mismatch between the source domain (foo.example.com) and the
   delegated domain (hosting.example.net).

   This situation is both insecure and unsustainable.  You have
   investigated the possibility of using DNS Security [RFC4033] and DNS-
   Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) [RFC6698] to solve the
   problem.  However, your customers and your operations team have told
   you that they will not be able to deploy DNSSEC and DANE for several
   years at least.  The product managers in your company are pushing you
   to find a method that can be deployed more quickly to overcome the
   lack of proper server identity checking for your hosted customers.

   One possible approach is to ask each customer to provide the public
   key / certificate for the "foo" service at a special HTTPS URI on
   their website ("https://foo.example.com/.well-known/posh.foo.json" is
   one possibility).  This could be a public key that you generate for
   the customer, but because the customer hosts it via HTTPS, any user
   agent can find that public key and check it against the public key
   you provide during TLS negotiation for the "foo" service (as one
   added benefit, the customer never needs to hand you a private key).
   Alternatively, the customer can redirect requests for that special

   HTTPS URI to an HTTPS URI at your own website, thus making it
   explicit that they have delegated the "foo" service to you.

   The approach sketched out above, called POSH ("PKIX Over Secure
   HTTP"), is explained in the remainder of this document.

2.  Discussion Venue

   The discussion venue for this document is the posh@ietf.org mailing
   list; visit https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/posh for
   subscription information and discussion archives.

3.  Terminology

   This document inherits security terminology from [RFC5280].  The
   terms "source domain", "derived domain", "reference identifier", and
   "presented identifier" are used as defined in the "CertID"
   specification [RFC6125].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

4.  Obtaining Verification Materials

   Server identity checking (see [RFC6125]) involves three different
   aspects:

   1.  A proof of the TLS server's identity (in PKIX, this takes the
       form of a PKIX certificate [RFC5280]).


   2.  Rules for checking the certificate (which vary by application
       protocol, although [RFC6125] attempts to harmonize those rules).


   3.  The materials that a TLS client uses to verify the TLS server's
       identity or check the TLS server's proof (in PKIX, this takes the
       form of chaining the end-entity certificate back to a trusted
       root and performing all validity checks as described in
       [RFC5280], [RFC6125], and the relevant application protocol
       specification).

   When POSH is used, the first two aspects remain the same: the TLS
   server proves it identity by presenting a PKIX certificate [RFC5280]
   and the certificate is checked according to the rules defined in the
   appropriate application protocol specification (such as [RFC6120] for

Internet-Draft                    POSH                    September 2013


   XMPP).  However, the TLS client obtains the materials it will use to
   verify the server's proof by retrieving a JSON Web Key (JWK) set
   [JOSE-JWK] over HTTPS ([RFC2616] and [RFC2818]) from a well-known URI
   [RFC5785].

   The process for retrieving a PKIX certificate over secure HTTP is as
   follows.

   1.  The TLS client performs an HTTPS GET at the source domain to the
       path "/.well-known/posh.{servicedesc}.json".  The value of
       "{servicedesc}" is application-specific; see Section 9 of this
       document for more details.  For example, if the application
       protocol is some hypothetical "Foo" service, then "{servicedesc}"
       could be "foo"; thus if a Foo client were to use POSH to verify a
       Foo server for the domain "foo.example.com", the HTTPS GET
       request would be as follows:


   GET /.well-known/posh.foo.json HTTP/1.1
   Host: foo.example.com



   2.  The source domain HTTPS server responds in one of three ways:


       *  If it possesses a PKIX certificate for the requested path, it
          responds as detailed in Section 4.1.


       *  If it has a reference to where the PKIX certificate can be
          obtained, it responds as detailed in Section 4.2.


       *  If it does not have any PKIX certificate for the requested
          path, it responds with a client error status code (e.g., 404).


4.1.  Source Domain Possesses PKIX Certificate

   If the source domain HTTPS server possesses the certificate
   information, it responds to the HTTPS GET with a success status code
   and the message body set to a JSON Web Key (JWK) set [JOSE-JWK].  The
   JWK set MUST contain at least one JWK object.

   Each included JWK object MUST possess the following information:

   o  The "kty" field set to the appropriate key type used for TLS
      connections (e.g., "RSA" for a certificate using an RSA key).


   o  The required parameters for the key type (e.g., "n" and "e" for a
      certificate using an RSA key).

   Additionally, each JWK object MUST possess at least one of the
   following:

   o  The "x5t" field set to the certificate thumbprint, as per section
      3.6 of [JOSE-JWK].


   o  The "x5c" field set to the certificate chain, as per section 3.7
      of [JOSE-JWK].

   The following example illustrates the usage described above.

4.2.  Source Domain References PKIX Certificate

   If the source domain HTTPS server has a reference to the certificate
   information, it responds to the HTTPS GET with a JSON document.  The
   document contains a "url" field whose value is the HTTPS URL where
   TLS clients can obtain the actual JWK set.

   Example Reference Response

   HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
   Content-Type: application/json
   Content-Length: 78

   {
     "url":"https://hosting.example.com/.well-known/
            posh.foo.json"
   }


   The client performs an HTTPS GET for the URL specified in the "url"
   field value.  The HTTPS server for the URI at which the client has
   been redirected responds to the request with a JWK set.  The content
   retrieved from the "url" location MUST NOT itself be a reference
   (e.g., containing only the "url" field and no "keys" field), in order
   to prevent circular references.

   Note: The JSON document returned by the source domain HTTPS server
   MUST contain either a reference or a JSON Web Key set, but MUST NOT
   contain both.

4.3.  Performing Verification

   The TLS client compares the PKIX information obtained from the TLS
   server against each JWK object in the POSH results, until a match is
   found or the collection of POSH verification materials is exhausted.
   If none of the JWK objects match the TLS server PKIX information, the
   TLS client SHOULD reject the connection.

   The TLS client SHOULD compare the fingerprint of the PKIX certificate
   from the TLS server against the "x5t" field of the JWK object (note
   the "x5t" field is the base64url encoding of the fingerprint).  If
   the "x5c" field is present instead of the "x5t" field, the TLS client
   generates a fingerprint of the first array element, by performing a
   SHA-1 hash over the PKIX certificate's DER encoding.

   The TLS client MAY verify the certificate chain provided in the "x5c"
   field of the JWK object, but it MUST NOT implicitly consider the
   final certificate in the "x5c" field to be a trust anchor itself; the
   TLS client only uses the end entity certificate information for
   verification.

5.  Secure Delegation

   The delegation from the source domain to the delegated domain can be
   considered secure if the certificate offered by the TLS server
   matches the POSH certificate, regardless of how the POSH certificates
   are obtained.

6.  Order of Operations

   In order for the TLS client to perform verification of reference
   identifiers without potentially compromising data, POSH processes
   MUST be complete before any application-level data is exchanged for
   the source domain.  The TLS client SHOULD perform all POSH retrievals
   before opening any socket connections to the application protocol
   server.  For application protocols that use DNS SRV, the POSH
   processes ideally ought to be done in parallel with resolving the SRV
   records and the addresses of any targets, similar to the "happy
   eyeballs" approach for IPv4 and IPv6 [RFC6555].

7.  Caching Results

   Ideally, the TLS client relies on the expiration time of the
   certificate obtained via POSH, and not on HTTP caching mechanisms.
   To that end, the HTTPS servers for source and derived domains SHOULD
   specify a 'Cache-Control' header indicating a short duration (e.g.,
   max-age=60) or "no-cache" to indicate that the response (redirect or
   content) is not appropriate to cache at the HTTP level.

8.  Alternates and Roll-over

   To indicate alternate PKIX certificates (such as when an existing
   certificate will soon expire), the returned JWK set MAY contain
   multiple JWK objects.  The JWK set SHOULD be ordered with the most
   relevant certificate first as determined by the application service
   operator (e.g., the renewed certificate), followed by the next most
   relevant certificate (e.g., the certificate soonest to expire).  Here
   is an example:

       {

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a well-known URI [RFC5785] for protocols that
   use POSH.  The completed template follows.



      URI suffix:  posh.

      Change controller:  IETF

      Specification document:  [[ this document ]]

      Related information:  Because the "posh."  string is merely a
            prefix, protocols that use POSH need to register particular
            URIs that are prefixed with the "posh."  string.

   Note that the registered URI is "posh."  (with a trailing dot).  This
   is merely a prefix to be placed at the front of well-known URIs
   [RFC5785] registered by protocols that use POSH, which themselves are
   responsible for the relevant registrations with the IANA.  The URIs
   registered by such protocols SHOULD begin with "posh."  and end with
   ".json" (indicating a media type of application/json [RFC4627] or
   application/jwk-set+json [JOSE-JWK]).

   For POSH-using protocols that rely on DNS SRV records [RFC2782], the
   part of the well-known URI between "posh."  and ".json" SHOULD be

Internet-Draft                    POSH                    September 2013


   "{service}.{proto}", where the "{service}" is the DNS SRV "Service"
   prepended by the underscore character "_" and the "{proto}" is the
   DNS SRV "Proto" also prepended by the underscore character "_".  As
   an example, the well-known URI for XMPP server-to-server connections
   would be "posh._xmpp-server._tcp.json" since XMPP [RFC6120] registers
   a service name of "xmpp-server" and uses TCP as the underlying
   transport protocol.

   For other POSH-using protocols, the part of the well-known URI
   between "posh."  and ".json" can be any unique string or identifier
   for the protocol, which might be a service name registered with the
   IANA in accordance with [RFC6335] or which might be an unregistered
   name.  As an example, the well-known URI for the mythical "Foo"
   service could be "posh.foo.json".

   Note: As explained in [RFC5785], the IANA registration policy
   [RFC5226] for well-known URIs is Specification Required.

10.  Security Considerations

   This document supplements but does not supersede the security
   considerations provided in specifications for application protocols
   that decide to use POSH (e.g., [RFC6120] and [RFC6125] for XMPP).
   Specifically, the security of requests and responses sent via HTTPS
   depends on checking the identity of the HTTP server in accordance
   with [RFC2818].  Additionally, the security of POSH can benefit from
   other HTTP hardening protocols, such as HSTS [RFC6797] and key
   pinning [KEYPIN], especially if the TLS client shares some
   information with a common HTTPS implementation (e.g., platform-
   default web browser).

   Note well that POSH is used by a TLS client to obtain the public key
   of a TLS server to which it might connect for a particular
   application protocol such as IMAP or XMPP.  POSH does not enable a
   hosted domain to transfer private keys to a hosting service via
   HTTPS.  POSH also does not enable a TLS server to engage in
   certificate enrollment with a certification authority via HTTPS, as
   is done in Enrollment over Secure Transport [EST].
