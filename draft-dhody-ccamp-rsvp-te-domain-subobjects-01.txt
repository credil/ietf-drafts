Abstract

   The RSVP-TE specification [RFC3209] and the GMPLS extensions to
   RSVP-TE [RFC3473] allow abstract nodes and resources to be explicitly
   included in a path setup.  Further Exclude Routes extensions
   [RFC4874] allow abstract nodes and resources to be explicitly
   excluded in a path setup.

   This document specifies new subobjects to include or exclude domains
   during path setup where domain is a collection of network elements
   within a common sphere of address management or path computational
   responsibility (such as an IGP area or an AS (4-Byte)).  Note that
   the use of Autonomous Number (AS) (2-Byte) as an abstract node
   representing domain is already defined in [RFC3209] and [RFC4874].

1.  Introduction

   The RSVP-TE specification [RFC3209] and the GMPLS extensions to
   RSVP-TE [RFC3473] allow abstract nodes and resources to be explicitly
   included in a path setup using the Explicit Route Object (ERO).

   Further Exclude Routes extensions [RFC4874] allow abstract nodes or
   resources to be excluded from the whole path using the Exclude Route
   object (XRO).  To exclude certain abstract nodes or resources between
   a specific pair of abstract nodes present in an ERO, a subobject
   Explicit Exclusion Route Subobject (EXRS) is used.

   [RFC3209] already describes the notion of abstract nodes, where an
   abstract node is a group of nodes whose internal topology is opaque
   to the ingress node of the LSP.  It further defines a subobject for
   Autonomous Systems (AS) (2-Byte).

   This document extends the notion of abstract nodes by adding new
   subobjects for IGP Areas and 4-byte AS numbers.  These subobjects MAY
   be included in Explicit Route Object (ERO), Exclude Route object
   (XRO) or Explicit Exclusion Route Subobject (EXRS).

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document.

   AS:  Autonomous System.

   Domain:  As per [RFC4655], any collection of network elements within
      a common sphere of address management or path computational
      responsibility.  Examples of domains include Interior Gateway
      Protocol (IGP) areas and Autonomous Systems (ASs).

   ERO:  Explicit Route Object

   EXRS:  Explicit Exclusion Route Subobject

   IGP:  Interior Gateway Protocol.  Either of the two routing
      protocols, Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) or Intermediate System
      to Intermediate System (IS-IS).

Internet-Draft                DOMAIN SUBOBJ                   April 2013


   IS-IS:  Intermediate System to Intermediate System.

   OSPF:  Open Shortest Path First.

   PCE:  Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application,
      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints.

   PCEP:  Path Computation Element Protocol.

   RSVP:  Resource Reservation Protocol

   TE LSP:  Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path.

   XRO:  Exclude Route Object

3.  Subobjects for Domains

3.1.  Domains

   [RFC4726] and [RFC4655] define domain as a separate administrative or
   geographic environment within the network.  A domain may be further
   defined as a zone of routing or computational ability.  Under these
   definitions a domain might be categorized as an Autonomous System
   (AS) or an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) area.

   As per [RFC3209], an abstract node is a group of nodes whose internal
   topology is opaque to the ingress node of the LSP.  Using this
   concept of abstraction, an explicitly routed LSP can be specified as
   a sequence of IP prefixes or a sequence of Autonomous Systems.  In
   this document we extend the notion to include IGP area and 4-Byte AS
   number.

   The sub-objects MAY appear in RSVP-TE, notably in -

   o  Explicit Route Object (ERO): As per [RFC3209], an explicit route
      is a particular path in the network topology including abstract
      nodes (domains).

   o  Exclude Route Object (XRO): As per [RFC4874], the exclude route
      identifies a list of abstract nodes (domains) that should not be
      traversed along the path of the LSP being established.

   o  Explicit Exclusion Route Subobject (EXRS): As per [RFC4874], used
      to specify exclusion of certain abstract nodes between a specific
      pair of nodes.  EXRS are a subobject inside the ERO.  These
      subobjects are used to specify the domains that must be excluded

      between two abstract nodes.

3.2.  Explicit Route Object (ERO)'s Subobjects

   As stated in [RFC3209], an explicit route is a particular path in the
   network topology.  In addition to the ability to identify specific
   nodes along the path, an explicit route can identify a group of nodes
   (abstract nodes) that must be traversed along the path.

   Some subobjects are defined in [RFC3209], [RFC3473], [RFC3477],
   [RFC4874] and [RFC5553] but new subobjects related to domains are
   needed.

   The following subobject types are used in ERO.


                Type   Subobject
                 1     IPv4 prefix
                 2     IPv6 prefix
                 3     Label
                 4     Unnumbered Interface ID
                 32    Autonomous system number (2 Byte)
                 33    Explicit Exclusion (EXRS)
                 34    SRLG
                 64    IPv4 Path Key
                 65    IPv6 Path Key

   This document extends the above list to support 4-Byte AS numbers and
   IGP Areas.


                Type   Subobject
                 TBD   Autonomous system number (4 Byte)
                 TBD   OSPF Area id
                 TBD   ISIS Area id

3.2.1.  Autonomous system

   [RFC3209] already defines 2-Byte AS number.

   To support 4-Byte AS numbers as per [RFC4893], the following
   subobject is defined:

3.2.2.  IGP Area

   Since the length and format of Area-id is different for OSPF and
   ISIS, the following two subobjects are defined:

   For OSPF, the area-id is a 32 bit number.  The subobject is encoded
   as follows:


      0                   1                   2                   3

   For IS-IS, the area-id is of variable length and thus the length of
   the subobject is variable.  The Area-id is as described in IS-IS by
   ISO standard [ISO 10589].  The subobject is encoded as follows:


      0                   1                   2                   3

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   L: The L bit is an attribute of the subobject as define in [RFC3209].

   Type: (TBA by IANA) indicating IS-IS Area ID.

   Length: Variable.  As per [RFC3209], the total length of the
   subobject in bytes, including the L, Type and Length fields.  The
   Length MUST be at least 4, and MUST be a multiple of 4.

   Area-Len: Variable (Length of the actual (non-padded) IS-IS Area
   Identifier in bytes; Valid values are from 2 to 11 inclusive).

   Reserved: Zero at transmission, ignored at receipt.

   IS-IS Area Id: The variable-length IS-IS area identifier.  Padded
   with trailing zeroes to a four-byte boundary.

3.2.3.  Mode of Operation

   The new subobjects to support 4-Byte AS and IGP (OSPF / ISIS) Area
   MAY also be used in the ERO to specify an abstract node (a group of
   nodes whose internal topology is opaque to the ingress node of the
   LSP).

   All the rules of processing (for example Next Hop Selection, L bit
   processing, unrecognized subobjects etc) are as per the [RFC3209].

3.3.  Exclude Route Object (XRO)'s Subobjects

   As stated in [RFC4874], the exclude route identifies a list of
   abstract nodes that should not be traversed along the path of the LSP
   being established.

   Some subobjects are defined in [RFC3209], [RFC3477], [RFC4874] and

   The following subobject types are used in XRO.

   IGP Areas.

                 TBD   OSPF Area id
                 TBD   ISIS Area id

3.3.1.  Autonomous system

   [RFC3209] and [RFC4874] already define a 2-Byte AS number.

   To support 4-Byte AS numbers as per [RFC4893], the following
   subobject is defined:


      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

     |                          AS Id (4 bytes)                      |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The meaning of the L bit, similar to [RFC4874], is as follows:

   0 indicates that the abstract node (AS) specified MUST be excluded.

   1 indicates that the abstract node (AS) specified SHOULD be avoided.

   The meaning of all the other elements (Type, Length, Reserved and
   4-Byte AS Id) is same as explained above in Section 3.2.1.

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |L|    Type     |     Length    |         Reserved              |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                    OSPF Area Id (4 bytes)                     |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The meaning of the L bit, similar to [RFC4874], is as follows:

   0 indicates that the abstract node (OSPF Area) specified MUST be
   excluded.

   1 indicates that the abstract node (OSPF Area) specified SHOULD be
   avoided.

   The meaning of all the other elements (Type, Length, Reserved and
   OSPF Area Id) is same as explained above in Section 3.2.2.

   For IS-IS, the area-id is of variable length and thus the length of
   the subobject is variable.  The Area-id is as described in IS-IS by
   ISO standard [ISO 10589].  The subobject is encoded as follows:


      0                   1                   2                   3

     //                        IS-IS Area ID                        //

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The meaning of the L bit, similar to [RFC4874], is as follows:

   0 indicates that the abstract node (IS-IS Area) specified MUST be
   excluded.

   1 indicates that the abstract node (IS-IS Area) specified SHOULD be
   avoided.

   The meaning of all the other elements (Type, Length, Area-Len,
   Reserved and IS-IS Area Id) is same as explained above in
   Section 3.2.2.

3.3.3.  Mode of Operation

   The new subobjects to support 4-Byte AS and IGP (OSPF / ISIS) Area
   MAY also be used in the XRO to specify exclusion of an abstract node
   (a group of nodes whose internal topology is opaque to the ingress
   node of the LSP).

   All the rules of processing are as per the [RFC4874].

3.4.  Explicit Exclusion Route Subobject

   As per [RFC4874], the Explicit Exclusion Route defines abstract nodes
   or resources that must not or should not be used on the path between
   two inclusive abstract nodes or resources in the explicit route.
   EXRS is an ERO subobject that contains one or more subobjects of its
   own, called EXRS subobjects.

   The EXRS subobject may carry any of the subobjects defined for XRO,
   thus the new subobjects to support 4-Byte AS and IGP (OSPF / ISIS)
   Area MAY also be used in the EXRS.  The meanings of the fields of the
   new XRO subobjects are unchanged when the subobjects are included in
   an EXRS, except that scope of the exclusion is limited to the single
   hop between the previous and subsequent elements in the ERO.

   All the rules of processing are as per the [RFC4874].

4.  Interaction with Path Computation Element (PCE)

   The domain subobjects to be used in Path Computation Element Protocol
   (PCEP) are referred to in [PCE-DOMAIN].  Note that the new domain
   subobjects follow the principle that subobjects used in PCEP
   [RFC5440] are identical to the subobjects used in RSVP-TE.

5.  Examples

5.1.  Inter-Area LSP Path Setup

   In an inter-area LSP path setup where the ingress and the egress
   belong to different IGP areas within the same AS, the domain
   subobjects MAY be represented using an ordered list of IGP area
   subobjects in an ERO.  The AS number MAY be skipped, as area

                   Figure 2: Domain Corresponding to AS

   As shown in Figure 2, where each AS has a single IGP area (area 0),
   the area subobject MAY be skipped as AS is enough to uniquely
   identify a domain.  So the signaling at Ingress -

   ERO:(A1, A2, AS B, AS C, Egress); or

   ERO:(A1, A2, AS B, Area 0, AS C, Area 0, Egress).

   Area subobject is optional and it MAY be skipped.  An RSVP-TE
   implementation should be able to understand both notations and there
   is no change in the processing rules as mentioned in [RFC3209].

   Note that to get a domain disjoint path, the ingress may also signal
   the backup path with -

   XRO:(AS B)

5.2.2.  Example 2

   As shown in Figure 3, where AS 200 is made up of multiple areas, the
   signaling MAY include both AS and Area subobject to uniquely identify
   a domain.

   for:

          232   EXCLUDE_ROUTE

          TBA       IS-IS Area ID                 [This I.D.]


7.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for MPLS-TE and GMPLS signaling are covered
   in [RFC3209] and [RFC3473].  This document does not introduce any new
   messages or any substantive new processing, and so those security
   considerations continue to apply.

   The route exclusion security consideration are covered in [RFC4874]
   and continue to apply.
