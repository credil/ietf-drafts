1.  Introduction

   This document lists a set of PCP [RFC6887] deployment models.

2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   o  PCP server denotes a functional element that receives and
      processes PCP requests from a PCP client.  A PCP server can be co-
      located with or be separated from the function (e.g., NAT,
      Firewall) it controls.  Refer to [RFC6887].
   o  PCP client denotes a PCP software instance responsible for issuing
      PCP requests to a PCP server.  Refer to [RFC6887].

3.  Single Homed CPE Model: Local PCP Server

   This model assumes PCP is enabled in the LAN side to control
   functions located in the CPE.  The PCP server is reachable with the
   IP address of the private-faced interface.

      |   Client    |
      +-------------+



4.  Single Homed CPE Model: Multiple PCP Servers

   This model assumes a customer site is connected to the same ISP's
   network.  One or multiple PCP servers are deployed in the ISP's
   domain; each of them manage distinct set of functions.  In example
   shown in the following figure:

   o  NAT64 device are used to interwork with IPv4-only devices.

   o  NPTv6 function is used for engineering motivation internal to the
      ISP.

      +-------------+
      |    PCP      |
      |   Client    |----+                            ,-----------.
      +-------------+    |   +------------+         ,'    ISP     `--.
                         +---|    CPE     |         /                :
                             |            |________;    NAT64        |
                         +---|            |        :                 |
      +-------------+    |   +------------+         \        NPTv6   |
      |    PCP      |----+                           ----------------.
      |   Client    |
      +-------------+



   Internal PCP client must discover both the external IPv4 address and
   port numbers assigned by the NAT64 and the external IPv6 address
   assigned by the NPTv6.  These external addresses are used for example
   in referrals to indicate to remote peers both the IPv4 address and
   IPv6 address to reach an internal server deployed in an IPv6-only
   domain.

Internet-Draft            PCP Deployment Cases               August 2013


   The use of anycast-based addressing model is not recommended for this
   deployment case because two state entries are to be created in both
   NAT64 and NPTv6.

   The use of NAT64 and NPTv6 is for illustration purposes; other
   functions can be enabled.

5.  Hide PCP Servers Model

5.1.  PCP Proxy Model

   In order to hide PCP servers deployed within an administrative
   domain, an administrative entity may decide to deploy in front of PCP
   clients PCP Proxies that are responsible for relaying PCP requests to
   appropriate PCP servers:

   o  In order to prevent single failure scenarios, multiple PCP proxies
      can be hosted within an administrative domain.

   o  A PCP Proxy can be configured with one or multiple servers.

   o  Multiple PCP Proxies can be enabled; each of them manages a set of
      PCP servers.

   o  A PCP Proxy can be configured with the logic indicating how it
      should proceed to contact upstream PCP servers.

   o  Internal PCP clients are configured with the IP address(es) of the
      appropriate PCP proxy.

      *  If all PCP Proxies interact with the same PCP Server(s), the
         same IP address can be provisioned to PCP clients.

      *  If PCP Proxies do not interact with the same set of PCP
         Server(s), appropriate IP address(es) are to be returned to
         each requesting PCP Client.

                  |        |            |              |
                  |        |            |              |

                  | +-------------+   +--------------+ |
                  +------------------------------------+


5.2.  HTTP-Triggered PCP Client Model

   Another deployment model to hide deployed PCP servers is to relay on
   HTTP to interact with the PCP service.  This model can also be used
   by operators to accommodate cases where the PCP client is not
   available at the customer side.

   The deployment model relies on the following:

   o  An HTTP administration based interface is provided to the user to
      create flow-bases forwarding rules.

   o  The HTTP GUI can be part of a CPE management interface or be
      provided as part of the customer care portal.

   o  HTTP requests are translated into appropriate PCP servers in order
      to install the requested state.  The HTTP server embeds also a PCP
      client.

   o  The PCP client uses THIRD_PARTY option.

   o  The PCP Client should be configured with PCP server that controls
      the on-path PCP-controlled device for that user.

   o  One or multiple PCP Servers can be deployed.

   o  The use of a well-known address to reach internal PCP servers may
      not be convenient if all PCP server do not manage the same set of
      states.

6.  Separated PCP Server & PCP-controlled Device Model

   This model assumes the PCP server is not co-located with the PCP-
   controlled device.  Moreover:

   o  In order to prevent single failure scenarios, multiple PCP servers
      can be hosted within an administrative domain.

   o  A PCP server can be control one or many PCP-controlled devices.

   o  Multiple PCP servers can be enabled; each of them manages a set of
      PCP-controlled devices.

   o  Internal PCP clients are configured with the IP address(es) of the
      appropriate PCP server.

      *  If all PCP servers interact with the same PCP-controlled
         devices., the same IP address can be provisioned to PCP
         clients.

      *  If PCP servers do not interact with the same set of PCP-
         controlled devices, appropriate IP address(es) are to be
         returned to each requesting PCP Client.

   Note, PCP is not used as interface between the PCP server and the
   PCP-controlled device.  Other protocols (e.g., H.248) can be used for
   that purpose.

7.  Cascaded PCP-controlled Nodes Model

   This model assumes cascaded PCP-controlled devices are deployed.  A
   typical example is provided below.

                                                      ,-----------.
                               PCP Server           ,'             `--.

   |Client |    |Router|      |NAT Router|        :     Internet       |
   +-------+    +------+      +----------+         \                   |
                                                    \                  ;

                                                             `-----'


   This model requires a PCP Proxy function [I-D.ietf-pcp-proxy] be
   deployed in intermediate PCP-controlled devices:

   o  The PCP client is not aware of the presence of more than one level
      of PCP servers.

   o  Each intermediate PCP proxy must contact the appropriate next hop
      PCP server.

   o  Because of the statefull nature of PCP, anycast-based addressing
      model may not be appropriate when the PCP Server is co-located
      with the PCP-controlled device.

7.1.  Single Homed CPE Model: PCP Proxy Model

   This model assumes no PCP-controlled function is located in the CPE
   (e.g., DS-Lite case).  The ultimate PCP server is located in ISP

   side.  The PCP server can be deduced from other provisioning
   parameters (e.g., use the IP address of the AFTR as PCP server);
   otherwise the IP address (s) must be discovered by other means.

   The use of an anycast-based model may not be convenient in some cases
   (e.g., multiple PCP-controlled devices are deployed; each of them
   manage a subset of services and state).

   Internal PCP clients can interact with one single PCP servers.

9.  Multi-Homed CPE Model: Multiple PCP Servers

   A typical example of this model is shown in the following figure:

                  |   FW1     | |    FW2    |
                  +-------+---+ +----+------+
                          |          |
                          |          |
                          |          |
                   -------+----------+------
                          |
                        +-+-----+

                        +-------+


   The PCP client must interact with all PCP servers; otherwise
   complications arise to communicate with remote peers.  The use of
   anycast-based model will induce failures in communicating with
   external peers (e.g., incoming packets will be dropped by one of the
   firewalls).

10.  Security Considerations

   PCP-related security considerations are discussed in [RFC6887].

11.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any action from IANA.
