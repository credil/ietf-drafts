              A Framework for E-VPN Performance Monitoring
                 draft-zheng-l2vpn-evpn-pm-framework-00

Abstract

   The capability of Ethernet VPN performance monitoring (PM) is
   important to meet the Service Level Agreement(SLA) for the service
   beared.  Since multipoint-to-point or multipoint-to-multipoint
   (MP2MP) network model applies, flow identifying is a big challenge
   for E-VPN PM.  This document specifies the framework and mechanisms
   for the application of E-VPN PM.

1.  Introduction

   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is a proven and widely deployed
   Ethernet L2VPN solution.  However, it has a number of limitations
   when it comes to redundancy, multicast optimization and provisioning
   simplicity.  Also, new applications are driving several new
   requirements for other L2VPN services such as E-TREE, VPWS, and VPMS.
   Furthermore, data center interconnect applications are driving the
   need for new service interface types, the "VLAN-aware Bundling"
   service interfaces.  Then the Ethernet VPN (E-VPN) solution (defined
   in [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn]) has been proposed to meet these
   requirements which is documented in [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn-req].

Internet-Draft           A Framework for EVPN PM               July 2013


   An E-VPN comprises PEs that form the edge of the MPLS infrastructure
   and CEs that are connected to PEs.  The PEs provide virtual Layer 2
   bridged connectivity between the CEs.  In E-VPN, MAC learning between
   PEs occurs not in the data plane but in the control plane.  PEs
   advertise the MAC addresses learned from the CEs, along with the
   associated MPLS label, to other PEs in the control plane by using MP-
   BGP.

   The capability of E-VPN to measure and monitor performance metrics
   for packet loss, delay, as well as related metrics is essential for
   meeting the Service Level Agreement (SLA).  This measurement
   capability also provides operators with greater visibility into the
   performance characteristics of the services in their networks, and
   provides diagnostic information in case of performance degradation or
   failure and helps for fault localization.  To perform the measurement
   of packet loss, delay and other metrics on a particular E-VPN flow,
   the egress PE needs to determine which specific ingress EVI packets
   belongs to.  There exists complete and mature performance monitoring
   mechanism for the traditional L2VPN based on the point-to-point PW.
   But in the case of E-VPN, multipoint-to-point (MP2P) or multipoint-
   to-multipoint (MP2MP) network model applies, it makes the flow
   identifying a big challenge for packets loss and delay measurement.
   This MP2P or MP2MP model also apply to L3VPN, please refer to
   [I-D.zheng-l3vpn-pm-analysis] for detailed description of the
   challenge for performance monitoring of such network model.

   This document defines the framework for performance monitoring of
   E-VPN.  The point-to-point connection named as EVI-to-EVI tunnel is
   introduced in E-VPN.  And the corresponding process of control plane
   and data plane is defined.

3.  Overview and Concepts

   Based on the mechanisms in [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn], for a particular
   MAC address route, the directly connected PE allocates the same MPLS
   label to all the remote PEs which maintain the MAC routing and
   forwarding instance (EVI) of that E-VPN.  Thus for the egress PE, it
   is unable to identify the source EVI of the received E-VPN packets.

   To perform the packet loss or delay measurement on a specific E-VPN
   flow, it is critical to establish the Point-to-Point connection
   between the two EVIs.  Once the Point-to-Point connection is built
   up, current measurement mechanisms for MPLS networks may be applied
   to E-VPN.  A new concept "EVI-to-EVI Tunnel" is introduced in the
   following section to establish such Point-to-Point connection in
   E-VPN.

3.1.  EVI-to-EVI Tunnel

   In order to perform performance monitoring in E-VPN, a point-to-point
   connection between any two EVIs of a particular E-VPN needs to be
   established.  This point-to-point connection enables the egress PE
   identifying the ingress EVI of the received E-VPN packet, thus
   enables the measurement of the packet loss and delay between the
   ingress and egress EVIs.  Such point-to-point connection between an
   ingress EVI and an egress EVI is called "EVI-to-EVI Tunnel (ET)".

4.  Control Plane

   This section describes the control plane mechanisms for E-VPN
   performance monitoring.

4.1.  E-VPN Membership Auto-Discovery

   Before the Point-to-Point connections between EVIs could be
   established, each PE attaching a given E-VPN needs to learn all the
   remote PEs that attach to the same E-VPN.  This could be achieved by
   the Ethernet A-D route per EVI defined in [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn].
   Please refer to section 9.4.1 [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn] for details.

4.2.  EVI-to-EVI Tunnel Label Allocation

   After obtaining the E-VPN membership information, each PE needs to
   allocate MPLS labels to identify the EVI-to-EVI tunnel from the
   remote EVI to the local EVI.  We call such labels as ET labels in
   this document.  For each local EVI, the egress PE SHOULD allocate
   different ET labels for each remote EVI in PEs belonging to the same
   E-VPN.  As such, the egress PE could identify the E-VPN flow received
   from different ingress EVIs, and the packet loss and delay

   measurement could be performed between each ingress EVI and the local
   EVI.

5.  Data Plane

   This section introduces two new MPLS label stack encapsulations when
   ET label applies.

5.1.  Additional Label for Ingress EVI Identification

   When a E-VPN data packet is to be sent on the ingress PE, firstly the
   label advertised by the MP-BGP for the Mac address route is pushed
   onto the label stack.  The ET label allocated by the egress EVI for
   the ingress EVI should then be pushed onto the label stack to
   identify the Point-to-Point connection between the sending and
   receiving EVI.  Finally the MPLS tunnel label is pushed onto the
   label stack.  The process of TTL and COS fields between the E-VPN
   label encapsulation and the tunnel label encapsulation is done
   according to the Pipe and Uniform Models defined by [RFC3270] and
   [RFC3443].The value of the TTL and COS field in the MAC label's
   encapsulation SHOULD be copied to the corresponding fields of the ET
   label's encapsulation.  As such, one extra label is carried in the
   label stack compared with E-VPN data plane defined in
   [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn].

   When the E-VPN data packet received by the egress PE, the outermost
   tunnel label is popped, then the egress PE could use the ET label to
   identify the ingress EVI of the packet.  The process of TTL and COS
   fields at the egress node should be done according to the Pipe and
   Uniform Models defined by [RFC3270] and [RFC3443].  Since the value
   of the TTL and COS fields of the MAC label encapsulation and the ET
   label encapsulation are the same, the TTL and COS fields of the ET
   label encapsulation could be ignored during the course of the TTL and
   COS process at the egress node.

               +--------------+              +--------------+
               | Tunnel Label |              | Tunnel Label |
               +--------------+        \     +--------------+
               |   MAC Label  |  -------\    |   ET Label   |

5.2.  Replace MAC Label with ET Label

   Since the ET label identifies the connection between the ingress EVI
   and egress EVI, it could also be used to identify the egress EVI
   forwarding table in which the MAC prefix lookup should be performed.
   Thus when encapsulating the E-VPN data packets, the ingress PE could
   simply replace the MAC label with the ET label, then push the tunnel
   label.  The process of TTL and COS fields between the MAC label
   encapsulation and the tunnel label encapsulation is done according to
   the Pipe and Uniform Models defined by [RFC3270] and [RFC3443].  The
   TTL and COS value of the MAC label entry should be copied to the TTL
   and COS field of the ET label entry respectively.  In this way the
   depth of the MPLS label stack is unchanged.

   The encapsulation method would require the egress PE to perform MAC
   prefix lookup in the egress EVI forwarding table before the packet
   can be forwarded to a specific CE.  The similar procedure is also
   required when per-instance EVI label allocation mechanism is used.
   The process of TTL and COS fields at the egress node should be done
   according to the Pipe and Uniform Models defined by [RFC3270] and
   [RFC3443].  Since the MAC label encapsulation is replaced with the ET
   label encapsulation, the TTL and COS fields of the VT label
   encapsulation should be used as those of the MAC label encapsulation
   during the course of the TTL and COS process at the egress node.

               +--------------+              +--------------+
               | Tunnel Label |              | Tunnel Label |
               +--------------+        \     +--------------+
               |   MAC Label  |  -------\    |   ET Label   |
               +--------------+  -------/    +--------------+
               |    Payload   |        /     |    Payload   |
               +--------------+              +--------------+

6.  E-VPN Performance Monitoring

   [RFC6374] defines procedure and protocol mechanisms to enable the
   efficient and accurate measurement of packet loss, delay, as well as
   related metrics in MPLS networks.  It provides either point-to-point
   or point-to-multipoint measurement capabilities.  Once the point-to-
   point connection EVI-to-EVI Tunnel is established between the ingress
   and egress EVIs, the procedures for the packet loss and delay
   measurement as defined in [RFC6374] can be utilized for E-VPN
   performance monitoring.  The main difference between performance
   monitoring of E-VPN and MPLS is the format of identifiers in the Loss
   Measurement (LM) and Delay Measurement (DM) messages.  Specifically,

Internet-Draft           A Framework for EVPN PM               July 2013


   for E-VPN, the source and destination addresses of the LM and DM
   messages should be set to the concatenation of the Route
   Distinguisher (RD) of the particular EVI and the IP address of the
   ingress and egress PE respectively.
