Abstract

   This document specifies SA46T Prefix Translator (SA46T-PT)
   specification.  SA46T-PT expand IPv4 network plane by connecting
   SA46T domain and SA46T-PR domain.  SA46T-PT translate prefix part of
   SA46T address and SA46T-PR address both are IPv6 address.  SA46T-PT
   does not translate IPv4 packet which is encapsulated, so transparency
   of IPv4 packet is not broken.

1.  Introduction

   This document provide SA46T Prefix Translator (SA46T-PT)
   specification.

   The basic strategy for IPv6 deployment is dual stack.  However,
   because of exhaustion of IPv4 address, there will be no IPv4
   addresses for configuring dual stack in near future.  That means
   there will be IPv6 only networks automatically.

   However, there are many IPv4 only networks still exist and those
   seems continuous use in near future.  That means methods continuous
   use of IPv4 network over IPv6 only network will be required.

   SA46T [I-D.draft-matsuhira-sa46t-spec] provide such methods.  In
   addition, SA46T-PR [I-D.draft-matsuhira-sa46t-pr-spec] also provide
   such methots.  SA46T is backbone network based approach, on the other
   hand, SA46T-PR is stub network based approach.

   SA46T-PT expand IPv4 network plane by connecting SA46T domain and
   SA46T-PR domain.  SA46T-PT translate prefix part of SA46T address and

   SA46T-PR address both are IPv6 address.  SA46T-PT does not translate
   IPv4 packet which is encapsulated, so transparency of IPv4 packet is
   not broken.

2.  Basic Network Configuration

   Figure 1 shows network configuration with SA46T-PT.  At large view,
   the network consists three parts, SA46T domain, SA46T-PR domain, and
   SA46T-PT.  SA46T-PT connect SA46T domain and SA46T-PR domain.

                                 Figure 1

   SA46T domain consists three parts, backbone network, stub network and
   SA46T.  Backbone network can be operated with IPv6 only.  Stub
   network has three cases, IPv4 only, Dual Stack (both IPv4 and IPv6),
   and IPv6 only.SA46T connects backbone network and stub network in
   case IPv4 still works in that stub network.  If stub network is IPv6
   only, SA46T is not needed.  SA46T is a backbone network based
   approach, that mean SA46T advertise special route for SA46T.

   And also, SA46T-PR domain consists three parts, backbone network,
   stub network and SA46T.  Backbone network can be operated with IPv6
   only.  Stub network has three cases, IPv4 only, Dual Stack (both IPv4
   and IPv6), and IPv6 only.SA46T connects backbone network and stub
   network in case IPv4 still works in that stub network.  If stub

   network is IPv6 only, SA46T-PR is not needed.  SA46T-PR is a stub
   network based approach.

3.  Basic function of SA46T-PT

   This section describe basic function of SA46T-PT.

3.1.  Translation processing

   SA46T-PT translate between SA46T packet and SA46T-PT packet.  SA46T
   packet and SA46T-PT packet are almost the same, however IPv6 address
   are different.

   Fig shows packet format of SA46T domain and SA46T-PT domain.

   figure Figure 3 shows SA46T address format and Figure 4 shows SA46T-
   PR address format.  These format almost the same except SA46T address
   prefix in SA46T address and SA46T-PR address prefix in SA46T-PR
   address.

   SA46T-PT translate from SA46T prefix to SA46T-PR prefix, or from
   SA46T-PR prefix to SA46T prefix using SA46T Prefix Translation
   (SA46T-PT) table.  fig Figure 5shows address resolution manner and

   may contain SA46T prefix.

3.4.  Destination address resolution

   For address resolution for destination address, SA46T-PT use SA46T-PT
   table.

3.5.  Source address resolution

   For address resolution for source address, SA46T-PT use interface
   information, not SA46T-PT table.  From SA46T domain to SA46T-PR
   domain, SA46T-PT use IPv6 address prefix of the interface which
   belong SA46T-PR domain.  From

4.  Sample Configuration

   Figure Figure 7shows sample confiuration of SA46T-PT.  In this
   example, there are four IPv4 stub network with the same IPv4 network
   plane, and two of four are in SA46T domain and other two of four are
   in SA46T-PR domain.

   In this example, SA46T prefix is 2001:0db8:0:46::/64.

   table size can be possible.
