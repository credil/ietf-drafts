    Abstract 

       In order to update the DNS (Domain Name System)[1] resource records 
       (RRs) for the node when its name or address changes, the DDNS 
       (Dynamic DNS) protocol[2] has been standardized as an extension of 
       basic DNS protocol. Then the security DDNS scheme[3] was proposed to 
       enhance the security of DDNS. Based on these two protocols, the DNS 
       update can be used in many scenarios, for example in the DHCP 
       (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)[4] deployed environment. 

       Based on these specifications, this document defines the extension 
       in MIPv6 (Mobile IPv6)[5] to achieve DNS update for the named MN 
       (Mobile Node). Specifically speaking, the FQND Option defined in the 
       RFC4704[6] is included in the MIPv6 BU (Binding Update) signaling 
       message. Then the PTR RR or AAAA and PTR RRs may be updated by the 
       HA (Home Agent) when the HoA (Home Address) or name of MN changes.

      1. Introduction 

       Based on DNS, peer entities can find each other through the FQDN-to-
       IP address mapping querying. In this way, the communication can be 
       established from an easily remembered name other than the 
       meaningless IP address. This is the basic feature of Internet. 

       In order to support the session connectivity in the mobile Internet, 
       the MIPv6 protocol was proposed in which two addresses are used to

    Internet-Draft           DNS update for MIPv6             October 2011 
     

       split the identifier and locator of one MN. As the identifier, the 
       HoA can be registered in the DNS as the AAAA record of the MN. In 
       this way, the CN (Corresponding Node) can always find it and the DNS 
       is relatively stable.  

       However, the related DNS records still must be updated in order to 
       maintain the MN reachability when its HoA or name changes. As stated 
       in RFC 6275, when the home network prefix changes, the HA should 
       notify the new prefix to the MN. In this way, the MN can configure 
       the new available HoA accordingly. Although the HoA change is not so 
       frequent compared with the CoA of the MN, it will significantly 
       increase with the growing number of the mobile internet user in the 
       near future. In order to guarantee the security and efficiency of 
       DNS update for the MN, this document extends the basic MIPv6 
       protocol. In order to make use of the standardized protocols and 
       minimize the modification of the mature protocols, we only add a 
       one-bit flag in BU message to notify the HA about the inclusion of 
       FQDN information, which is carried in the RFC 4704 defined FQDN 
       Option. 

      2. Extensions of MIPv6 

       In order to support the FQDN Option, a one-bit flag named D is added 
       in mobility header of the BU message as shown in Fig.1.  

        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                          
        |A|H|L|K|D|      Reserved       | ......                                  
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

       Fig.1. Extension of BU message 

       When the D flag is set to 1, the RFC 4704 defined FQDN Option is 
       included in the BU message as a new option or mobility header. 
       Besides, that means the DNS information may be changed and the 
       related DNS update is needed. When the D flag is set 0, no FQDN 
       Option is carried and it means the AAAA or PTR records of MN needs 
       no update. 

       The processing of FQDN Option conforms to the related specifications 
       in RFC 4704. 

    2.1. Operation of MN 

       For the named MN in foreign network, we recommend that the HoA is 
       registered in the DNS as a relatively stable identifier. However, 
     
     
    Yan et al.               Expires March,2012                   [Page 3] 
        
    Internet-Draft           DNS update for MIPv6             October 2011 
     

       once the HoA changes due to MIPv6 administration policy or home 
       network renumbering, the MN must resend the BU message for the 
       binding update. In this case, the D flag should be set to 1 and the 
       FQDN information of MN should be included in the BU message. In 
       other case, the BU message with D=0 and no FQDN Option is sent for 
       the traditional binding refreshment or CoA update.  

       For the named MN in home network, it only owns HoA as the usable 
       address. When the DNS update is needed in this case, the MN still 
       sends the BU message to HA carrying D=1 and FQDN Option for 
       operational consistency. However, the Lifetime filed should be set 
       to zero and with no CoA information accordingly to manifest that 
       this BU is not for binding establishment. 

    2.2. Operation of HA 

       When the HA receives a BU with D=1, it should extract out the FQDN 
       Option and process it according to the flags in FQDN Option and 
       management policy of MIPv6. Otherwise, the HA does nothing if D=0 or 
       the BU has no D flag. 

      3. DNS update 

       The HA operates as the DHCP server for the DNS update as specified 
       in the subsection 6.1 in RFC 4704. 

      4. DNS RR TTL 

       Even the HoA as an identifier is more stable than the CoA, it may be 
       still dynamic in the mobile environment. Then the MN and HA which 
       perform the DNS update should attempt to avoid the staling of DNS RRs. 
       The operation recommendation can be referred to section 7 in RFC 4704. 

      5. Security Considerations 

       The Security Dynamic DNS should be supported whatever the DNS update 
       is executed by HA or MN. Whether the FQDN-to-IP address mapping 
       should be updated by MN firstly depends on whether the MN has enough 
       security material for the security DNS update. However, the MIPv6 
       deployment policy may also require that all the DNS updates be 
       performed by the HA for the efficiency and security considerations. 
       Besides, the HA can identify and trust the accessed MN based on the 
       authentication schemes in MIPv6 (e.g., Diameter or RADIUS), then the 
       confident DNS update can be executed by the HA or the HA can 
       authority the FQDN-to-IP address mapping update to the MN.
