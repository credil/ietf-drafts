   or inactive state for multicast along with the Inclusive Multicast
   Ethernet Tag route or Ethernet A-D route in E-VPN.  The multicast
   state advertised can help optimization of multicast process in E-VPN
   to reduce unnecessary traffic replication for the broadcast, unknown
   unicast and multicast (BUM) traffic.

1.  Introduction

   E-VPN [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn] introduces a solution for multipoint
   L2VPN services, with advanced multi-homing capabilities, using BGP
   for distributing customer/client MAC address reachability information
   over the core MPLS/IP network.

   In E-VPN when the PE receives the broadcast, unknown unicast, or
   multicast (BUM) traffic, it will forward the traffic to other PEs of
   the E-VPN through ingress replication or P2MP LSPs.  The Inclusive
   Multicast Ethernet Tag routes distributed to discover the multicast
   membership of the E-VPN can be used to trigger setup of ingress
   replication tunnels or P2MP LSPs.  In the actual network, the
   multicast service maybe use a great deal of bandwidth.  It is
   important to save the possible bandwidth when deploy multicast
   service.

   This document defines a new extended community to advertise the
   active or inactive state for multicast along with Inclusive Multicast
   Ethernet Tag routes or Ethernet Auto-Discovery routes in E-VPN.  The
   multicast state advertised can help optimization of multicast process
   in E-VPN to reduce unnecessary traffic replication for the BUM
   traffic.

   CE: Customer Edge

   E-VPN: Ethernet VPN

   ES: Ethernet Segment

   ESI: Ethernet Segment Identifier

   EVI: Ethernet VPN Instance

3.  Problem Statements

   There exist multi-homing scenarios in E-VPN.  As shown in the figure
   1, CE2 multi-homes to two PEs ( PE2 and PE3).  When ingress
   replication is used for the BUM traffic, PE1 needs to send two copies
   of the same BUM traffic to both PE2 and PE3.  We assume that PE2 is
   the Designated Forwarder (DF) for the CE2 in the E-VPN.  Thus only
   PE2 will forward the BUM traffic to CE2 while the traffic to the PE3
   will be dropped.  From the example we can see that the copy of the
   BUM traffic sent to PE3 is not necessary in the network.  If PE1 can
   learn that the remote PE cannot forward the BUM traffic to any CE,
   the bandwidth can be saved for PE1 can stop to replicate the
   unnecessary traffic to the remote PE.  In order to achieve the
   object, the active or inactive state related with forwarding the BUM
   traffic in a EVI can be advertised by the originating PE.  As to a
   specific EVI, the active state means that there is at least one
   Ethernet Segment for the EVI on the PE which needs to forward the BUM
   traffic to the CE and the inactive state means that none of Ethernet
   Segments for the EVI on the PE would forward the BUM traffic to CEs.
   As to a specific Ethernet Segment in a EVI, the active state means
   the Ethernet Segment in the EVI would forward the BUM traffic to the
   CE and the inactive state means that the Ethernet Segment in the EVI
   would not forward the BUM traffic to the CE.

4.  Protocol Extensions

   A new extended community is defined to identify the multicast state
   of the EVI on the leaf PE.  This extended community is called as
   Multicast State Extended Community.  It is a new transitive extended
   community with the Type field is 0x06, and the Sub-Type is to be
   defined.  It may be advertised along with Inclusive Multicast
   Ethernet Tag routes or Ethernet Auto-Discovery routes.

   Each Multicast State Extended Community is encoded as a 8-octet value
   as follows:

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Type=0x06   | Sub-Type(TBD) |  State(One Octet)  |Reserved=0  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                       Reserved = 0                            |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The state is encoded as one octet.  A value of 0 means that the
   multicast state is Active and a value of 1 means that the multicast
   state is Inactive.

5.  Operations

5.1.  Multicast State Advertisement per EVI

   If the multicast state of a specific EVI needs to be advertised, the
   Multicast State Extended Community MUST be included in the Inclusive
   Multicast Ethernet Tag Route for the EVI.  Construction of the
   Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag Route can refer to Section 12.1 in
   [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn].  If the multicast state of the EVI is Active,
   the state field in the Multicast State Extended Community MUST be set
   to 0.  If the multicast state of the EVI is Inactive, the state field
   in the Multicast State Extended Community MUST be set to 1.  When a
   PE receives the Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag Route with the EVI
   State Extended Community, it can determine the multicast state of the
   EVI on the leaf PE originating the route is Active or Inactive.

5.2.  Multicast State Advertisement per <EVI, ESI>

   If the multicast state of a specific Ethernet Segment in an EVI needs
   to be advertised, the Multicast State Extended Community MUST be
   included in the Ethernet Auto-Discovery route for the Ethernet
   Segment in the EVI.  Constructing the Ethernet A-D Route per EVI can
   refer to Section 9.4 of [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn].  The Ethernet A-D
   route can be constructed for a given <ESI, Ethernet Tag ID> tuple per
   EVI or per <ESI, EVI>(where the Ethernet Tag ID is set to 0).  If the
   Ethernet Segment of a specific EVI transports the BUM traffic, the
   state field in the Multicast State Extended Community MUST be set to
   0.  If the Ethernet Segment of the EVI does not transport the BUM
   traffic, the state field in the Multicast State Extended Community
   MUST be set to 1.  When a PE receives Ethernet A-D routes per EVI
   with the EVI State Extended Community, it can determine the multicast
   state of the Ethernet Segment of the EVI on the leaf PE originating
   the route is Active or Inactive.  According to the states of the
   Ethernet Segments of the EVI on the leaf PE, the ingress PE can
   determines the state of the EVI on the leaf PE.  That is, if there
   exists one ES of the EVI which state is Active, it can determine the
   state of the EVI on the leaf PE is Active.  If there is no ES of the
   EVI which state is Active, it can determine the state of the EVI is
   Inactive.

6.  Application

6.1.  Ingress Replication

   When a PE determines the multicast state of the EVI on the leaf PE
   through the Multicast State Extended Community advertised along with
   the Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag routes or Ethernet A-D routes,
   it can only setup the P2P tunnels to the leaf PEs which states are
   Active for Ingress Replication while it will not setup the P2P tunnel
   to the leaf PE which EVI state is Inactive or it can stop the traffic
   to be replicated on the existing P2P tunnel to this leaf PE.  Thus
   the bandwidth for the BUM traffic can be saved in the network.

6.2.  P2MP MPLS LSPs

   When a PE determines the multicast state of the EVI on the leaf PE
   through the Multicast State Extended Community advertised along with
   the Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag routes or Ethernet A-D routes,
   it can only setup the P2MP MPLS LSP to the leaf PEs which states are
   Active.  Thus the bandwidth for the BUM traffic can be saved in the
   network.

   mechanism, the backup egress node needs to be designated for the
   primary egress node for a P2MP LSP.  The previous hop node of the
   primary egress node sets up a backup Sub-LSP from itself to the
   backup egress node after receiving the information about the backup
   egress node.  The multicast state advertisement proposed by the
   document can facilitate the provision of the local protection
   mechanism.  The ingress PE of a specific EVI can learn the multicast
   state of egress PEs of the EVI through the advertised Multicast State
   Extended Community.  Through the Ethernet A-D routes per EVI the
   ingress PE can also learn the information on which pair of PEs are
   multi-homed by one CE.  Based on these information, the ingress PE
   can determine which egress PE can be used as the backup node to
   protect the primary egress node for a P2MP LSP using for the EVI.  So
   the ingress PE can trigger to setup P2MP LSP with locally protecting
   egress nodes.  The method saves much provision effort for this type
   of local protection through the auto-discovery mechanism since it
   need not statically designate the protection between the backup
   egress node and the primary egress node for a P2MP LSP.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new BGP Extended Community called as
   Multicast State Extended Community.  The sub-type value for this
   extended community is to be assigned by IANA.

8.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security aspects beyond those of E-VPN
   ([I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn]).
