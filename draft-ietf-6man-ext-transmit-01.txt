                 Transmission of IPv6 Extension Headers
                    draft-ietf-6man-ext-transmit-01

Abstract

   Various IPv6 extension headers have been standardised since the IPv6
   standard was first published.  This document updates RFC 2460 to
   clarify how intermediate nodes should deal with such extension
   headers and with any that are defined in future.  It also specifies
   how extension headers should be registered by IANA, with a
   corresponding minor update to RFC 2780.

1.  Introduction and Problem Statement

   In IPv6, an extension header is any header that follows the initial
   40 bytes of the packet and precedes the upper layer header (which
   might be a transport header, an ICMPv6 header, or a notional "No Next
   Header").

   An initial set of IPv6 extension headers was defined by [RFC2460],
   which also described how they should be handled by intermediate
   nodes, with the exception of the hop-by-hop options header:

   "...extension headers are not examined or processed
   by any node along a packet's delivery path, until the packet reaches
   the node (or each of the set of nodes, in the case of multicast)
   identified in the Destination Address field of the IPv6 header."


   This provision meant that forwarding nodes should be completely
   transparent to extension headers.  There was no provision for
   forwarding nodes to modify them, remove them, insert them, or use
   them to affect forwarding behaviour.  Thus, new extension headers
   could be introduced progressively, used only by hosts that have been
   updated to create and interpret them.  The extension header mechanism
   is an important part of the IPv6 architecture, and several new
   extension headers have been standardised since RFC 2460.

   Today, packets are often forwarded not only by straightforward IP
   routers, but also by a variety of intermediate nodes, often referred
   to as middleboxes, such as firewalls, load balancers, or packet

   classifiers.  Unfortunately, experience has showed that as a result,
   the network is not transparent to IPv6 extension headers.  Contrary
   to Section 4 of RFC 2460, middleboxes sometimes examine and process
   the entire IPv6 packet before making a decision to either forward or
   discard the packet.  This means that they need to traverse the chain
   of extension headers, if present, until they find the transport
   header (or an encrypted payload).  Unfortunately, because not all
   IPv6 extension headers follow a uniform TLV format, this process is
   clumsy and requires knowledge of each extension header's format.

   The process is potentially slow as well as clumsy, possibly
   precluding its use in nodes attempting to process packets at line
   speed.  The present document does not intend to solve this problem,
   which is caused by the fundamental architecture of IPv6 extension
   headers.  This document focuses on clarifying how the header chain
   should be traversed in the current IPv6 architecture.

   If they encounter an unrecognised extension header type, some
   firewalls treat the packet as suspect and drop it.  Unfortunately, it
   is an established fact that several widely used firewalls do not
   recognise some or all of the extension headers standardised since RFC
   2460.  It has also been observed that certain firewalls do not even
   handle all the extension headers standardised in RFC 2460, including
   the fragment header [I-D.taylor-v6ops-fragdrop], causing fundamental
   problems of connectivity.  This applies in particular to firewalls
   that attempt to inspect packets statelessly at very high speed, since
   they cannot take the time to reassemble fragmented packets,
   especially when under a denial of service attack.

   Other types of middlebox, such as load balancers or packet
   classifiers, might also fail in the presence of extension headers
   that they do not recognise.

   A contributory factor to this problem is that, because extension
   headers are numbered out of the existing IP Protocol Number space,
   there is no collected list of them.  For this reason, it is hard for
   an implementor to quickly identify the full set of standard extension
   headers.  An implementor who consults only RFC 2460 will miss all
   extension headers defined subsequently.

   This combination of circumstances creates a "Catch-22" situation
   [Heller] for the deployment of any newly standardised extension
   header except for local use.  It cannot be widely deployed, because
   existing middleboxes will render large parts of the Internet opaque
   to it.  However, most middleboxes will not be updated to allow the
   new header to pass until it has been proved safe and useful on the
   open Internet, which is impossible until the middleboxes have been
   updated.

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Extension Header Transmission           May 2013


   The uniform TLV format now defined for extension headers [RFC6564]
   will improve the situation, but only for future extensions.  Some
   tricky and potentially malicious cases will be avoided by forbidding
   very long chains of extension headers that need to be fragmented
   [I-D.ietf-6man-oversized-header-chain].  This will alleviate concerns
   that stateless firewalls cannot handle a complete header chain as
   required by the present document.

   However, these changes are insufficient to correct the underlying
   problem.  The present document clarifies that the above requirement
   from RFC 2460 applies to all types of node that forward IPv6 packets
   and to all extension headers standardised now and in the future.  It
   also requests IANA to create a subsidiary registry that clearly
   identifies extension header types, and updates RFC 2780 accordingly.
   Fundamental changes to the IPv6 extension header architecture are out
   of scope for this document.

   Also, Hop-by-Hop options are not handled by many high speed routers,
   or are processed only on a slow path.  This document also updates the
   requirements for processing the Hop-by-Hop options header to make
   them more realistic.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In the remainder of this document, the term "forwarding node" refers
   to any router, firewall, load balancer, prefix translator, or any
   other device or middlebox that forwards IPv6 packets with or without
   examining the packet in any way.

2.  Requirement to Transmit Extension Headers

2.1.  All Extension Headers

   Any forwarding node along an IPv6 packet's path, which forwards it
   for any reason, SHOULD do so regardless of any extension headers that
   are present, as required by RFC 2460.  Exceptionally, if this node is
   designed to examine extension headers for any reason, such as
   firewalling, it MUST recognise and deal appropriately with all
   standard IPv6 extension header types.  The list of standard extension
   header types is maintained by IANA (see Section 4) and implementors
   are advised to check this list regularly for updates.

   RFC 2460 requires destination hosts to discard packets containing
   unrecognised extension headers.  However, intermediate forwarding

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Extension Header Transmission           May 2013


   nodes SHOULD NOT do this by default, since that might cause them to
   inadvertently discard traffic using a recently standardised extension
   header, not yet recognised by the intermediate node.  The only
   exceptions to this rule are discussed below.

   As mentioned above, forwarding nodes that discard packets containing
   extension headers are known to cause connectivity failures and
   deployment problems.  Therefore, it is important that forwarding
   nodes that inspect IPv6 extension headers can parse all standard
   headers and are able to behave according to the above requirements.
   If a forwarding node discards a packet containing a standard IPv6
   extension header, it MUST be the result of a configurable policy, and
   not just the result of a failure to recognise such a header.  This
   means that the discard policy for each standard type of extension
   header MUST be individually configurable.  The default configuration
   SHOULD allow all standard extension headers.  Forwarding nodes MUST
   be configurable to allow packets containing unrecognised extension
   headers, and such packets MAY be dropped by default.

   The IPv6 Routing Header Types 0 and 1 have been deprecated and SHOULD
   NOT be used.  However, as specified in [RFC5095], this does not mean
   that the IPv6 Routing Header can be unconditionally dropped by
   forwarding nodes.  Packets containing undeprecated Routing Headers
   SHOULD be forwarded by default.  At the time of writing, these
   include Type 2 [RFC6275], Type 3 [RFC6554], and Types 253 and 254
   [RFC4727].  Others may be defined in future.

2.2.  Hop-by-Hop Options

   The IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options header SHOULD be processed by
   intermediate forwarding nodes as described in [RFC2460].  However, it
   is to be expected that high performance routers will either ignore
   it, or assign packets containing it to a slow processing path.
   Designers planning to use a Hop-by-Hop option need to be aware of
   this likely behaviour.

   As a reminder, in RFC 2460, it is stated that the Hop-by-Hop Options
   header, if present, must be first.

3.  Security Considerations

   Forwarding nodes that operate as firewalls MUST conform to the
   requirements in the previous section in order to respect the IPv6
   extension header architecture.  In particular, packets containing
   standard extension headers are only to be discarded as a result of a
   configurable policy.

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Extension Header Transmission           May 2013


   When new extension headers are standardised in the future, those
   implementing and configuring forwarding nodes, including firewalls,
   will need to take account of them.  A newly defined header will
   exercise new code paths in a host that does recognise it, so caution
   may be required.  It is therefore to be expected that the deployment
   process will be slow and will depend on satisfactory operational
   experience.  Until it is complete, the new extension will fail in
   some parts of the Internet.  This aspect needs to be considered when
   deciding to standardise a new extension.  Specific security
   considerations for each new extension should be documented in the
   document that defines it.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to clearly mark in the Assigned Internet Protocol
   Numbers registry those values which are also IPv6 Extension Header
   types defined by an IETF standards action, for example by adding an
   extra column to indicate this.  This will also apply to any IPv6
   Extension Header types standardised in the future.

   Additionally, IANA is requested to replace the existing empty IPv6
   Next Header Types registry by an IPv6 Extension Header Types
   registry.  It will contain only those protocol numbers which are also
   marked as IPv6 Extension Header types in the Assigned Internet
   Protocol Numbers registry and were defined by an IETF standards
   action.  The initial list will be as follows:

   o  0, Hop-by-Hop Options, [RFC2460]

   o  43, Routing, [RFC2460], [RFC5095]

   o  44, Fragment, [RFC2460]

   o  50, Encapsulating Security Payload, [RFC4303]

   o  51, Authentication, [RFC4302]

   o  60, Destination Options, [RFC2460]

   o  135, MIPv6, [RFC6275]

   o  140, shim6, [RFC5533]

   This list excludes both type 59, No Next Header, [RFC2460], which is
   not an extension header as such, and type 139, HIP, [RFC5201], which
   is experimental.

   The references to the IPv6 Next Header field in [RFC2780] are to be
