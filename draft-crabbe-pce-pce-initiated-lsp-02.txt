  PCEP Extensions for PCE-initiated LSP Setup in a Stateful PCE Model
                 draft-crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp-02

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
   computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.

   The extensions described in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] provide
   stateful control of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic
   Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSP) via PCEP, for a model where
   the PCC delegates control over one or more locally configured LSPs to
   the PCE.  This document describes the creation and deletion of PCE-
   initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE model.

Internet-Draft      Stateful PCE - PCE-initiated LSP           July 2013


1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element Protocol PCEP.  PCEP
   defines the communication between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and
   a Path Control Element (PCE), or between PCE and PCE, enabling
   computation of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) for Traffic
   Engineering Label Switched Path (TE LSP) characteristics.

   Stateful pce [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] specifies a set of
   extensions to PCEP to enable stateful control of TE LSPs between and
   across PCEP sessions in compliance with [RFC4657].  It includes
   mechanisms to effect LSP state synchronization between PCCs and PCEs,
   delegation of control of LSPs to PCEs, and PCE control of timing and
   sequence of path computations within and across PCEP sessions and
   focuses on a model where LSPs are configured on the PCC and control
   over them is delegated to the PCE.

   This document describes the setup, maintenance and teardown of PCE-
   initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE model, without the need for
   local configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for a dynamic network
   that is centrally controlled and deployed.


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC5440]: PCC,
   PCE, PCEP Peer.

   This document uses the following terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]: Stateful PCE, Delegation, Redelegation
   Timeout, State Timeout Interval LSP State Report, LSP Update Request.

   The following terms are defined in this document:

   PCE-initiated LSP:  LSP that is instantiated as a result of a request
      from the PCE.

   The message formats in this document are specified using Routing
   Backus-Naur Format (RBNF) encoding as specified in [RFC5511].


3.  Architectural Overview

3.1.  Motivation

   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] provides stateful control over LSPs that
   are locally configured on the PCC.  This model relies on the LER
   taking an active role in delegating locally configured LSPs to the

   PCE, and is well suited in environments where the LSP placement is
   fairly static.  However, in environments where the LSP placement
   needs to change in response to application demands, it is useful to
   support dynamic creation and tear down of LSPs.  The ability for a
   PCE to trigger the creation of LSPs on demand can make possible agile
   software-driven network operation, and can be seamlessly integrated
   into a controller-based network architecture, where intelligence in
   the controller can determine when and where to set up paths.

   A possible use case is one of a software-driven network, where
   applications request network resources and paths from the network
   infrastructure.  For example, an application can request a path with
   certain constraints between two LSRs by contacting the PCE.  The PCE
   can compute a path satisfying the constraints, and instruct the head
   end LSR to instantiate and signal it.  When the path is no longer
   required by the application, the PCE can request its teardown.

   Another use case is one of dynamically adjusting aggregate bandwidth
   between two points in the network using multiple LSPs.  This
   functionality is very similar to auto-bandwidth, but allows for
   providing the desired capacity through multiple LSPs.  This approach
   overcomes two of the limitations auto-bandwidth can experience: 1)
   growing the capacity between the endpoints beyond the capacity of
   individual links in the path and 2) achieving good bin-packing
   through use of several small LSPs instead of a single large one.  The
   number of LSPs varies based on the demand, and LSPs are created and
   deleted dynamically to satisfy the bandwidth requirements.

   Another use case is that of demand engineering, where a PCE with
   visibility into both the network state and the demand matrix can
   anticipate and optimize how traffic is distributed across the
   infrastructure.  Such optimizations may require creating new paths
   across the infrastructure.

3.2.  Operation overview

   A PCC indicates its ability to support PCE provisioned dynamic LSPs
   during the PCEP Initialization Phase via a new flag in the STATEFUL-
   PCE-CAPABILITY TLV (see details in Section 4.1).

   The decision when to instantiate or delete a PCE-initiated LSP is out
   of the scope of this document.  To instantiate or delete an LSP, the
   PCE sends a new message, the Path Computation LSP Initiate Request
   (PCInitiate) message to the PCC.  The LSP Initiate Request MUST
   include the SRP and LSP objects, and the LSP object MUST include the
   Symbolic Path Name TLV.

   For an instantiation operation, the PCE MUST include the ERO and END-



Crabbe, et al.          Expires January 13, 2014                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      Stateful PCE - PCE-initiated LSP           July 2013


   POINTS object and may include various attributes as per [RFC5440].
   The PCC creates the LSP using the attributes communicated by the PCE,
   and local values for the unspecified parameters.  It assigns a unique
   PLSP-ID for the LSP and automatically delegates the LSP to the PCE.
   It also generates an LSP State Report (PCRpt) for the LSP, carrying
   the newly assigned PLSP-ID and indicating the delegation via the
   delegation bit.  The PCE may update the attributes of the LSP via
   subsequent PCUpd messages.  Subsequent LSP State Report and LSP
   Update Request for the LSP will carry the PCC-assigned PLSP-ID, which
   uniquely identifies the LSP.  See details in Section 5.3.

   Once instantiated, the delegation procedures for PCE-initiated LSPs
   are the same as for PCC initiated LSPs.  This applies to the case of
   a PCE failure as well.  In order to allow for network cleanup without
   manual intervention, the PCC SHOULD support removal of PCE-initiated
   LSPs as one of the behaviors applied on expiration of the State
   Timeout Interval [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].  The behavior SHOULD be
   picked based on local policy, and can result either in LSP removal,
   or into reverting to operator-defined default parameters.  See
   details in Section 6.

   To indicate a delete operation, the PCE MUST use the R flag in the
   SRP object.  As a result of the deletion request, the PCC MUST remove
   all state related to the LSP, and send a PCRpt with the R flag set
   for the removed state.  See details in Section 5.3.


4.  Support of PCE-initiated LSPs

   A PCC indicates its ability to support PCE provisioned dynamic LSPs
   during the PCEP Initialization phase.  The Open Object in the Open
   message contains the "Stateful PCE Capability" TLV, defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].  A new flag, the I (LSP-INSTANTIATION-
   CAPABILITY) flag is introduced to indicate support for instantiation
   of PCE-initiated LSPs.  A PCE can initiate LSPs only for PCCs that
   advertised this capability and a PCC will follow the procedures
   described in this document only on sessions where the PCE advertised
   the I flag.

4.1.  Stateful PCE Capability TLV

   The format of the STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV is shown in the
   following figure:

               Figure 1: STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV format

   The type of the TLV is defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] and it
   has a fixed length of 4 octets.

   The value comprises a single field - Flags (32 bits).  The U and S
   bits are defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].

   I (LSP-INSTANTIATION-CAPABILITY - 1 bit):  If set to 1 by a PCC, the
      I Flag indicates that the PCC allows instantiation of an LSP by a
      PCE.  If set to 1 by a PCE, the I flag indicates that the PCE will
      attempt to instantiate LSPs.  The LSP-INSTANTIATION-CAPABILITY
      flag must be set by both PCC and PCE in order to support PCE-
      initiated LSP instantiation.

   Unassigned bits are considered reserved.  They MUST be set to 0 on
   transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.


5.  PCE-initiated LSP instantiation and deletion

   To initiate an LSP, a PCE sends a PCInitiate message to a PCC.  The
   message format, objects and TLVs are discussed separately below for
   the creation and the deletion cases.

5.1.  The LSP Initiate Message

   A Path Computation LSP Initiate Message (also referred to as
   PCInitiate message) is a PCEP message sent by a PCE to a PCC to
   trigger LSP instantiation or deletion.  The Message-Type field of the
   PCEP common header for the PCInitiate message is set to [TBD].  The
   PCInitiate message MUST include the SRP and the LSP objects, and may
   contain other objects, as discussed later in this section.  If either
   the SRP or the LSP object is missing, the PCC MUST send a PCErr as
   described in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].  LSP instantiation is done
   by sending an LSP Initiate Message with an LSP object with the
   reserved PLSP-ID 0.  LSP deletion is done by sending an LSP Initiate
   Message with an LSP object carrying the PLSP-ID of the LSP to be
   removed and an SRP object with the R flag set (see Section 5.2).

Internet-Draft      Stateful PCE - PCE-initiated LSP           July 2013


   The format of a PCInitiate message for LSP instantiation is as
   follows:


   <PCInitiate Message> ::= <Common Header>
                            <PCE-initiated-lsp-list>
Where:

   <PCE-initiated-lsp-list> ::= <PCE-initiated-lsp-request>[<PCE-initiated-lsp-list>]

   <PCE-initiated-lsp-request> ::= <SRP>
                                   <LSP>
                                   <END-POINTS>
                                   <ERO>
                                   [<attribute-list>]

Where:
   <attribute-list> is defined in [RFC5440] and extended by PCEP extensions.

   The SRP object is used to correlate between initiation requests sent
   by the PCE and the error reports and state reports sent by the PCC.
   Every request from the PCE receives a new SRP-ID-number.  This number
   is unique per PCEP session and is incremented each time an operation
   (initiation, update, etc) is requested from the PCE.  The value of
   the SRP-ID-number MUST be echoed back by the PCC in PCErr and PCRpt
   messages to allow for correlation between requests made by the PCE
   and errors or state reports generated by the PCC.  Details of the SRP
   object and its use can be found in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].

5.2.  The R flag in the SRP Object

   The format of the SRP object is shown Figure 2:

              0                   1                   2                   3

   The type object is defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].

   A new flag is defined to indicate a delete operation initiated by the
   PCE:

   R (LSP-REMOVE - 1 bit):  If set to 1, it indicates a removal request
      initiated by the PCE.

5.3.  LSP instantiation

   LSP instantiation is done by sending an LSP Initiate Message with an
   LSP object with the reserved PLSP-ID 0.

   Receipt of a PCInitiate Message with a non-zero PLSP-ID and the R
   flag in the SRP object set to zero results in a PCErr message of type
   19 (Invalid Operation) and value 8 (non-zero PLSP-ID in LSP
   initiation request).

   The LSP-sig-type field in the LSP is set to the signaling type that
   is requested for the LSP setup.  This draft defines procedures for
   RSVP-signaled LSPs.

   The END-POINTS Object is mandatory for an instantiation request of an
   RSVP-signaled LSP.  It contains the source and destination addresses
   for provisioning the LSP.  If the END-POINTS Object is missing, the
   PCC MUST send a PCErr message with Error-type=6 (Mandatory Object
   missing) and Error-value=3 (END-POINTS Object missing).

   The ERO Object is mandatory for an instantiation request.  It
   contains the ERO for the LSP.  If the ERO Object is missing, the PCC
   MUST send a PCErr message with Error-type=6 (Mandatory Object
   missing) and Error-value=9 (ERO Object missing).

   The LSP Object MUST include the SYMBOLIC-PATH-NAME TLV, which will be
   used to correlate between the PCC-assigned PLSP-ID and the LSP.  If
   the TLV is missing, the PCC MUST send a PCErr message with Error-
   type=6(Mandatory object missing) and Error-value=14 (SYMBOLIC-PATH-
   NAME TLV missing).  The symbolic name used for provisioning PCE-
   initiated LSPs must not have conflict with the LSP name of any
   existing LSP in the PCC.  (Existing LSPs may be either statically
   configured, or initiated by another PCE).  If there is conflict with
   the LSP name, the PCC MUST send a PCErr message with Error-type=23
   (Bad Parameter value) and Error-value=1 (SYMBOLIC-PATH-NAME in use).
   The only exception to this rule is for LSPs for which the State
   timeout timer is running (see Section 6).

   The PCE MAY include various attributes as per [RFC5440].  The PCC
   MUST use these values in the LSP instantiation, and local values for



Crabbe, et al.          Expires January 13, 2014                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft      Stateful PCE - PCE-initiated LSP           July 2013


   unspecified parameters.  After the LSP setup, the PCC MUST send a
   PCRpt to the PCE, reflecting these values.  The SRP object in the
   PCRpt message MUST echo the value of the PCInitiate message that
   triggered the setup.

   If the PCC determines that the LSP parameters proposed in the
   PCInitiate message are unacceptable, it MUST trigger a PCErr with
   error-type=TBD (PCE instantiation error) and error-value=1
   (Unacceptable instantiation parameters).  If the PCC encounters an
   internal error during the processing of the PCInitiate message, it
   MUST trigger a PCErr with error-type=TBD (PCE instantiation error)
   and error-value=2 (Internal error).

   A PCC MUST relay to the PCE errors it encounters in the setup of PCE-
   initiated LSP by sending a PCErr with error-type=TBD (PCE
   instantiation error) and error-value=3 (RSVP signaling error).  The
   PCErr MUST echo the SRP-id-number of the PCInitiate message.  The
   PCEP-ERROR object SHOULD include the RSVP Error Spec TLV (if an ERROR
   SPEC was returned to the PCC by a downstream node).

   A PCC SHOULD be able to place a limit on either the number of LSPs or
   the percentage of resources that are allocated to honor PCE-initiated
   LSP requests.  As soon as that limit is reached, the PCC MUST send a
   PCErr message of type 19 (Invalid Operation) and value TBD "PCE-
   initiated limit reached" and is free to drop any incoming PCInitiate
   messages without additional processing.

5.4.  LSP deletion

   PCE-initiated removal of a PCE-initiated LSP is done by setting the R
   (remove) flag in the SRP Object in the PCInitiate message from the
   PCE.  The LSP is identified by the PLSP-ID in the LSP object.  If the
   PLSP-ID is unknown, the PCC MUST generate a PCErr with error type 19,
   error value 3, "Unknown PLSP-ID".  A PLSP-ID of zero removes all LSPs
   that were initiated by the PCE.  If the PLSP-ID specified in the
   PCInitiate message is not delegated to the PCE, the PCC MUST send a
   PCErr message indicating "LSP is not delegated" (Error code 19, error
   value 1 ([I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]).  Following the removal of the
   LSP, the PCC MUST send a PCRpt as described in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].


6.  LSP delegation and cleanup

   PCE-initiated LSPs are automatically delegated by the PCC to the PCE
   upon instantiation.  The PCC MUST delegate the LSP to the PCE by
   setting the delegation bit to 1 in the PCRpt that includes the
   assigned PLSP-ID.  All subsequent messages from the PCC must have the

Internet-Draft      Stateful PCE - PCE-initiated LSP           July 2013


   delegation bit set to 1.  The PCC cannot revoke the delegation for
   PCE-initiated LSPs for an active PCEP session.  Sending a PCRpt
   message with the delegation bit set to 0 results in a PCErr message
   of type 19 (Invalid Operation) and value TBD "Delegation for PCE-
   initiated LSP cannot be revoked".

   A PCE MAY return a delegation to the PCC, to allow for LSP transfer
   between PCEs.  Doing so MUST trigger the State Timeout Interval timer
   ([I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]).

   In case of PCEP session failure, control over PCE-initiated LSPs
   reverts to the PCC at the expiration of the redelegation timeout.  To
   obtain control of a PCE-initiated LSP, a PCE (either the original or
   one of its backups) sends a PCInitiate message, including just the
   SRP and LSP objects, and carrying the PLSP-ID of the LSP it wants to
   take control of.  Receipt of a PCInitiate message with a non-zero
   PLSP-ID normally results in the generation of a PCErr.  If the State
   Timeout timer is running, the PCC MUST NOT generate an error and
   redelegate the LSP to the PCE.  The State Timeout timer is stopped
   upon the redelegation.

   The State Timeout timer ensures that a PCE crash does not result in
   automatic and immediate disruption for the services using PCE-
   initiated LSPs.  PCE-initiated LSPs are not be removed immediately
   upon PCE failure.  Instead, they are cleaned up on the expiration of
   this timer.  This allows for network cleanup without manual
   intervention.  The PCC SHOULD support removal of PCE-initiated LSPs
   as one of the behaviors applied on expiration of the State Timeout
   Interval [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].  The behavior SHOULD be picked
   based on local policy, and can result either in LSP removal, or into
   reverting to operator-defined default parameters.


7.  IANA considerations

8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations described in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]
   apply to the extensions described in this document.  Additional
   considerations related to a malicious PCE are introduced.

8.1.  Malicious PCE

   The LSP instantiation mechanism described in this document allows a
   PCE to generate state on the PCC and throughout the network.  As a
   result, it introduces a new attack vector: an attacker may flood the
   PCC with LSP instantiation requests and consume network and LSR
   resources, either by spoofing messages or by compromising the PCE
   itself.

   A PCC can protect itself from such an attack by imposing a limit on
   either the number of LSPs or the percentage of resources that are
   allocated to honor PCE-initiated LSP requests.  As soon as that limit
   is reached, the PCC MUST send a PCErr message of type 19 (Invalid
   Operation) and value 3 "PCE-initiated LSP limit reached" and is free
   to drop any incoming PCInitiate messages without additional
   processing.

   Rapid flaps triggered by the PCE can also be an attack vector.  This
   will be discussed in a future version of this document.
