                   OSPFv3 Instance ID Registry Update
             draft-ietf-ospf-ospfv3-iid-registry-update-04

Abstract

   This document modifies the "Unassigned" number space in the IANA
   "OSPFv3 Instance ID Address Family Values" registry by dividing it in
   two halves, one half Unassigned but managed via Standards Action, and
   the other Reserved for Private Use.  It updates [RFC5838].

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5838] defined the "OSPFv3 Instance ID Address Family Values"
   registry for the purpose of mapping OSPFv3 Instance IDs to different
   address families.  The following table lists the value ranges as
   allocated for [RFC5838].

   +---------------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
   | Instance ID Range         | Description       | Assignment Policy |
   +---------------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
   | Instance ID # 0 - # 31    | IPv6 unicast AF   | Already Assigned  |
   | Instance ID # 32 - # 63   | IPv6 multicast AF | Already Assigned  |
   | Instance ID # 64 - # 95   | IPv4 unicast AF   | Already Assigned  |
   | Instance ID # 96 - # 127  | IPv4 multicast AF | Already Assigned  |
   | Instance ID # 128 - # 255 | Unassigned        | Standards Action  |
   +---------------------------+-------------------+-------------------+


   In some networks additional OSPFv3 instances may be required to
   operationally identify specific applications.  This need requires a
   pool of Instance IDs that the operator may locally assign for that
   purpose.

Internet-Draft     OSPFv3 Instance ID Registry Update         April 2013


   For example, [I-D.ietf-ospf-ipv4-embedded-ipv6-routing] describes an
   application in which IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses [RFC6052] are used
   to transport IPv4 packets over an IPv6 network.  While the
   IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses do in fact represent IPv6 destinations,
   it would be operationally benefitial to be able to easily identify
   the the specific application by having a separate space to do so.
   This benefit is enabled by the allocation of a range of Private Use
   Instance IDs.

   This document updates [RFC5838] by modifying the "OSPFv3 Instance ID
   Address Family Values" registry.  If divides the original Unassinged
   space in two halves, one half Unassigned but managed via Standards
   Action, and the other Reserved for Private Use.

2.  OSPFv3 Instance ID Address Family Values Registry Update

   The IANA "OSPFv3 Instance ID Address Family Values" registry must be
   updated as follows:

    +---------------------------+-------------+-----------------------+
    | Instance ID Range         | Description | Assignment Policy     |
    +---------------------------+-------------+-----------------------+
    | Instance ID # 128 - # 191 | Unassigned  | Standards Action      |
    | Instance ID # 192 - # 255 | Reserved    | Private Use [RFC5226] |
    +---------------------------+-------------+-----------------------+


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the modification of the "OSPFv3 Instance ID
   Address Family Values" registry as described in Section 2.  The
   reference to [RFC5838] should be removed from the registry for the
   modified ranges.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document modifies the assignment policy of an IANA registry
   defined in [RFC5838].  It does not introduce any new security issues.

5.  Acknowledgements

   Many thanks to Acee Lindem, Stewart Bryant, Nevil Brownlee, Pearl
   Liang, Ben Campbell, Adrian Farrel and Richard Barnes for their
   review and input.
