Abstract

   This draft proposes to relay throughput instead of congestion 
   back into the network in-band at the IP layer, such that the total 
   level of throughput is accessible to all IP devices along the path 
   followed by IP datagrams. The main advantage of this approach is that 
   applications that are not using the TCP protocol as transport 
   protocol could also apply the Conex concept to relay the throughput 
   experienced on the end-to-end path back into the network.

Internet-Draft         Exposing Conex Throughput             July 2011


1.  Introduction

   The ConEx working group is defining how IP packets will carry 
   additional ConEx information. This document is focusing on relaying 
   throughput instead of congestion information back into the network 
   in-band at the IP layer. By this mean, the total level of throughput 
   is visible to all IP devices along the path. 
   
   In [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech-01] a method is described that 
   relies on following sequence of operation (1) using ECN marks and 
   packet drops the receiver computes the end-to-end path congestion, 
   (2) the receiver feeds this congestion information back to the 
   sender using TCP transport protocol, see also [draft-kuehlewind-
   conex-accurate-ecn-00] (3) the sender relays the congestion that 
   has been experienced on the end-to-end path back into the network 
   in-band at the IP layer, such that the total level of congestion is 
   visible to all IP devices along the path. 

   This draft proposes to relay throughput instead of congestion 
   back into the network in-band at the IP layer, such that the total 
   level of throughput is visible to all IP devices along the path. For 
   this purpose, the proposed technique relies on another method to feed 
   congestion information back to the sender by using a non-TCP protocol 
   such as the DCCP (Datagram Congestion Control Protocol) transport 
   protocol instead of using the TCP transport protocol. The 
   advantage of this approach is that applications that are not using 
   the TCP protocol as transport protocol could also apply the Conex 
   concept to rely the throughput experienced on the end-to-end path 
   back into the network.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In addition to the terminology specified in [draft-ietf-conex-
   abstract-mech-01] and [draft-ietf-conex-concepts-uses-01], [RFC5348] 
   the following terms are used and defined in this document.

Internet-Draft         Exposing Conex Throughput             July 2011


   O Transport path throughput calculated at the sender: the per flow 
     transport sending rate as a function of the congestion rate, 
     round-trip time, and segment size. The transport path throughput 
     calculated at the sender can be realized using different methods. 
     As example, this draft uses as example the TCP throughput 
     equation that is specified in [RFC5348]. Note that in [RFC5348] 
     the term congestion rate is denoted as loss event rate. According 
     to [RFC5348] a loss event is defined as one or more lost or marked 
     packets from a window of data, where a marked packet refers to a 
     congestion indication (CE) from Explicit Congestion Notification 
     (ECN) [RFC3168]; 

   O Throughput exposure signal (ConEx-Throughput): a ConEx signal 
     encoded in IP packet headers from the sender to the network to 
     exposure the transport path throughput calculated at the sender. 

   O Intermediate ConEx enabled device: each Conex enabled device 
     located on a communication path between a sender and a receiver. 

   O Measured per flow throughput at intermediate ConEx enabled devices: 
     the per flow rate of packets that are passing through the output
     buffer of an intermediate Conex enabled device and 
     are not dropped, (2) are not ECN CE marked. Each ConEx enabled 
  device is only holding state on a flow if it first receives a   
  Throughput exposure signal.

   O Throughput exposure rate at intermediate ConEx devices: the 
     per flow rate of the received throughput exposure signals (Conex-
     Throughput). Each ConEx enabled device is only holding state on a 
     flow if it first receives a Throughput exposure signal (Conex- 
     Throughput).


2. Challenges and Requirements

2.1 Challenges

   The challenges that need to be addressed by the throughput exposure 
   approach are:

   o) The Internet operation has to enable multi-domain information  
      exchanges to effectively enable network-to-host information 
      passing as detailed in this document. This condition is of 
      particular importance for congestion control schemes that make use 
      of explicit rate feedback. On the other hand, multi-domain 
      environment shall be considered as non-cooperative.

Internet-Draft         Exposing Conex Throughput             July 2011


   o) It is important to emphasize that network support of rate 
      signaling suffers from the same scalability problems as identified 
      in [RFC2208]. Indeed, in-band rate signaling or out-of-band per-
      flow traffic specification signaling (like in the Resource 
      Reservation Protocol (RSVP)) results in similar scalability issues 
      due to the per-connection state maintenance. As noticed in Section 
      1 of [RFC6077], due to the non-cooperative nature of multi-domain 
      environments, it seems unlikely that network flow state could be 
      avoided (up to a certain extend) given the network's per-packet 
      flow rate instructions that would need to be compared against 
      variations in the actual flow rate, which is inherently not a per-
      packet metric. 
      These issues have been outstanding ever since integrated services 
      (IntServ) was identified as unscalable in 1997 [RFC2208]. Any 
      subsequent attempt to involve network elements in limiting flow 
      rates (including XCP, RCP, etc.) have run up against the same 
      scalability issues when intending deployment on the 
      public/worldwide Internet. 

   o) Security is a challenge for multi-domain exchange of explicit 
      rate/congestion signals, whether in-band or out-of-band.  At 
      domain boundaries, authentication and authorization issues can 
      arise whenever congestion control information is exchanged.  

2.2 Requirements

   The requirements the ConEx Signal shall meet in order to enable 
   throughput exposure, are in line with most of the requirements 
   presented in [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech-01]:

       o) The ConEx Signal SHOULD be visible to internetwork layer 
          devices along the entire path from the transport sender to the 
          transport receiver.  

       o) The ConEx Signal SHOULD be useful under only partial 
          deployment.

       o) The ConEx Signal SHOULD be timely.  

       o) The ConEx Signal SHOULD be accurate (i.e., such that the 
          signaled throughput is represented accurately).

   Note that in case of throughput exposure timeliness and accuracy 
   shall be bound by min;max limits in order to prevent non-significant 
   deviations (e.g. relative variations would be worth considering in 
   this respect).

   3. Method of Exposing Conex Throughput using non-TCP Feedback

   This document provides a method, see Figure 1, on (1) using ECN marks 
   and packet drops to calculate the end-to-end path loss event rate at 
   the receiver, (2) feedback this end-to-end path loss event rate 
   information back to the sender using a non-TCP transport protocol, 
   such as the DCCP transport protocol, see [RFC5622] or [RFC4342] (3) 
   calculate the sending throughput at the sender, (4) relaying the 
   throughput that has been experienced on the end-to-end path back into 
   the network in-band at the IP layer, such that the total level of 
   throughput is visible to all IP devices along the path. 

   3.1 Description of the Method

   The following paragraphs described each of the steps of the proposed 
   method:

   1) During the first step, the end-to-end path 
   loss event rate is calculated at the receiver using ECN marks 
   and packet drops. This rate can be calculated using different 
   algorithms. As example, the loss event rate calculation specified in 
   [RFC5348] (in combination with [RFC4342]) or [RFC4828] (in 
   combination with [RFC5622]) can be used for this purpose. For a 
   normative specification of the loss event rate see Section 5 of 
   [RFC5348] and [RFC4828].  

   2) During the second step, the receiver sends this 
   end-to-end path loss event rate information back to the sender using 
   a non-TCP transport protocol, such as the DCCP transport protocol, 
   see [RFC4340], [RFC5622] or [RFC4342]. In this case, the receiver 
   reports using DCCP-Ack packets, among others, the number of loss 
   event rate by using the Loss event rate option, described in Section 
   8.5 of [RFC4342].  

   3) In the third step, the sender calculates the path throughput for 
   the transport connection (to which the feedback is directed). The 
   path thoughput as computed by the sender describes the sending rate 
   as a function of the congestion rate (as computed by the receiver), 
   the round-trip time, and the segment size. 
   The transport path throughput calculated at the sender can be 
   accomplished using different algorithms. As example, the TCP 
   throughput equation specified in [RFC5348] or [RFC4828] can be 
   applied. Using the calculated throughput, the sender generates the 
   Conex throughput exposure signals that are encoded in IP packet 
   headers.

Internet-Draft         Exposing Conex Throughput             July 2011

   4) In the fourth step, the Throughput exposure signals are relayed to 
   the network in-band at the IP layer, such that the total level of 
   throughput is visible to all IP devices along the path. 
   Each intermediate ConEx enabled device may hold a state to 
   store the value of the exposed throughput rate, which is 
   the per flow rate of the received throughput exposure signals (Conex-
   Throughput). Each ConEx enabled device is only holding state on a 
   flow if it first receives a Throughput exposure signal (Conex-
   Throughput). Note that the state information stored locally at Conex 
   enabled devices is "application dependent". 
   It is important to note that the per flow throughput measured by  
   intermediate ConEx enabled devices located closer to the sender can 
   be higher than the per flow throughput measured by Conex enabled 
   devices located closer to the receiver.

   Identical use cases and applications can be used as the ones 
   described in [draft-ietf-conex-concepts-uses-01], using the same 
   semantics related to the exposed and measured congestion. The only 
   difference is now that the intermediate Conex enabled devices can 
   monitor and process the "Measured per flow throughput" and the 
   "Throughput exposure rate", instead of monitoring and processing the 
    measured congestion rate and the signaled exposed congestion rate, 
   respectively.

Internet-Draft         Exposing Conex Throughput             July 2011


   An example of applying this method, is to enable each intermediate 
   Congestion enabled device to observe whether the 
   "Measured per flow throughput" is equal or higher than the 
   "Throughput exposure rate" of the same flow. 
   If that is not the case then the intermediate Conex enabled devices 
   can react accordingly depending on the use case/application that uses 
   this solution.
   {More details will be provided in a next version of this draft}


3.2.  Codepoint Encoding

   This encoding involves signaling the following codepoint:
   
   o) Conex-Throughput: a ConEx signal encoded in IP packet headers from 
   the sender to the network to exposure the transport path throughput 
   calculated at the sender. 

3.3. Conex Throughput Components
  
   The same Conex enabled devices can be used as the ones specified in   
  [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech-01].

3.3.1 Modified Senders 

   The senders SHOULD support the protocol that is carrying the 
   throughput exposure information from the receiver to the sender. 
   
   Moreover, the sender should implement an algorithm that can use the 
   feedback congestion information to calculate the throughput rate at 
   the sender. As example, if DCCP in combination with the TCP-Friendly 
   Rate Control (TFRC) is used, then the solutions specified in e.g., 
   [RFC5348] (in combination with [RFC4342]) or [RFC4828] (in 
   combination with [RFC5622]) SHOULD be supported. In this case, the 
   sender MUST be able to support the following functionality:

   O Computation of the transport path throughput: the per flow 
     transport sending rate as a function of the congestion rate, round-
     trip time, and segment size. The transport path throughput 
     calculated at the sender using the TCP throughput equation 
     specified in [RFC5348]. Note that in [RFC5348] the term congestion 
     rate is denoted as loss event rate. According to [RFC5348] a loss 
     event is defined as one or more lost or marked packets from a 
     window of data, where a marked packet refers to a congestion 
     indication (CE) from Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) 
     [RFC3168].

Internet-Draft         Exposing Conex Throughput             July 2011

   In addition, the sender MUST be able to support the following 
   functionality:

   o) Generation and encoding of ConEx-Throughput signals in IP packet 
      headers of datagrams flowing from the sender to the receiver in 
      order to expose the transport path throughput calculated at the 
      same sender. 

3.3.2 Intermediate Conex Enabled Devices

   The same intermediate Conex enabled devices MAY be used as the 
   intermediate Conex enabled devices specified in [draft-ietf-conex-  
   abstract-mech-01], e.g., Policer and Audit but not restricted to.

   Compared to [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech-01], the only difference 
   introduced for the support of throughput exposure is 
   that i) the intermediate Conex enabled devices SHOULD monitor and ii) 
   the intermediate Conex enabled devices SHOULD process the "Measured 
   per flow throughput" and the "Throughput exposure rate", instead of 
   monitoring and processing the measured congestion rate and the 
   signaled exposed congestion rate, respectively.

3.3.3 Modified Receivers 

   Moreover, the receivers should be able to support the same transport 
   protocol supported by the sender used to feedback the calculated 
   congestion information from the receiver to the sender.    
   As example, the receivers should be able to support the TCP-Friendly 
   Rate Control (TFRC) based congestion control protocol, e.g., 
   [RFC5348] (in combination with [RFC4342]) or [RFC4828] (in 
   combination with [RFC5622]). 

   In addition, the receiver MUST be able to support the following 
   functionality:

   o) Measure per flow throughput: the per flow rate of packets that are 
     Received and (1) are not dropped, (2) are not ECN CE marked. 

   o) Measure throughput exposure rate: the 
     per flow rate of the received throughput exposure signals.
