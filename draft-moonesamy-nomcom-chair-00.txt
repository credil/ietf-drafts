1.  Introduction

   RFC 3777 [RFC3777] states that the Internet Society President
   appoints the Chair of the Nominating Committee.  This document
   updates RFC 3777 [RFC3777] to allow the appointment of a man and a
   woman as Nominating Committee Chairs.  Having two Nominating
   Committee Chairs of different gender ensures gender parity.

2.  Updated Text from RFC 3777

   The word "Chair" is replaced with the word "Chairs" throughout RFC
   3777 [RFC3777] unless stated otherwise in this document.

   RFC 3777 [RFC3777], Section 3, "General", Paragraph 4, is replaced as
   follows:

      The process officially begins with the announcement of the two
      Chairs of the committee.  The process officially ends when all
      confirmed candidates have been announced.

   Section 4, "Nominating Committee Selection", Paragraph 11 and 14 are
   replaced as follows:

      The nominating committee comprises at least two Chairs, 10 voting
      volunteers, 3 liaisons, and an advisor.

      The two Chairs are selected according to rules stated elsewhere in
      this document.

   Section 3, "General", Paragraph 20, 21 and 22, 23, 24, 25, are
   replaced as follows:

      The two Chairs of the nominating committee is responsible for
      ensuring the nominating committee completes its assigned duties in
      a timely fashion and performs in the best interests of the IETF
      community.

      The two Chair must be thoroughly familiar with the rules and
      guidance indicated throughout this document.  The two Chairs must
      ensure the nominating committee completes its assigned duties in a
      manner that is consistent with this document.

      The two Chairs must attest by proclamation at a plenary session of
      the First IETF that the results of the committee represent its
      best effort and the best interests of the IETF community.

      The two Chairs does not vote on the selection of candidates. 
      Although there is no term limit for serving in any IESG, IAB or

      IAOC position, the nominating committee may use length of service
      as one of its criteria for evaluating an incumbent.

      The Internet Society President appoints the two Chairs, who must
      meet the same requirements for membership in the nominating
      committee as a voting volunteer.  The two Chairs must not be of
      the same gender.

      The nominating committee Chairs must agree to invest the time
      necessary to ensure that the nominating committee completes its
      assigned duties and to perform in the best interests of the IETF
      community in that role.

   Section 3, "General", Paragraph 27, is replaced as follows:

      The two Chairs, in consultation with the Internet Society
      President, may appoint a temporary substitute for the Chair
      position.


3.  Security Considerations

   The document makes changes to the IETF process.  These changes will
   not affect the security of the Internet.

4. Acknowledgements

   The idea of having two Chairs of different gender was suggested by
   Michael Richardson.
