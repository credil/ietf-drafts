1.  Introduction

   This document defines the interactions between the future Homenet
   network and 6204bis Routers and HIPnet routers.  Currently 6204bis
   and HIPnet routers are being deployed by ISPs as Service Provider
   Edge Routers (SPER) for IPv6 deployment.  In the future the SPER will
   be a full Homenet routers but there will be a period of transition.
   This document specifies how currently deployed SPER will interact
   with Homenet architecture [I-D.ietf-homenet-arch].  Identifying the
   effects of key components of the architecture.  The goal of this
   document is to make recommendations on issues uncovered to make the
   devices work with the future Homenet.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   In this section we define terminology and abbreviations used
   throughout the text.

   o  Border: a point, typically resident on a router, between two
      networks, e.g.  between the main internal homenet and a guest
      network.  This defines point(s) at which filtering and forwarding
      policies for different types of traffic may be applied

   o  SPER: Service Provider Edge Router: A border router intended for
      use in a homenet, which connects the homenet to a service provider
      network.

Internet-Draft                    SPER                      October 2013


   o  Homenet: A home network, comprising host and router equipment,
      with one or more SPERs providing connectivity to service provider
      network(s).

   o  Internet Service Provider (ISP): an entity that provides access to
      the Internet.  In this document, a service provider specifically
      offers Internet access using IPv6, and may also offer IPv4
      Internet access.  The service provider can provide such access
      over a variety of different transport methods such as DSL, cable,
      wireless, and others.

   o  Home IP network HIPnet: A router intended for home or small-office
      use that forwards packet explicitly address to itself as defined
      in [I-D.grundemann-homenet-hipnet].

   o  6204bis: A router intended for home or small-office use that
      forwards packet explicitly address to itself as defined in [I-D
      .ietf-v6ops-6204bis]

3.  6204bis Service Provider Edge Router (SPER)

3.1.  Addressing

   A 6204bis SPER acquire LAN addressing thru DHCP Prefix Delegation
   [RFC3633].  A 6204bis SPER will assign a separate /64 from the
   delegated prefix(es) for each LAN interface.   The 6202bis SPER can
   assign address either thru SLAAC or DHCP to LAN host.   There is no
   mechanism for delegating any unused prefix(es) that were delegated to
   the 6204bis Router.

3.2.  Routing

   A 6204bis SPER is capable of learning default routes thru Router
   Advertisement on the WAN interface.  All other routing information is
   learned when a prefix is assigned to a LAN interface by the 6204bis
   SPER.  All other Routing information is learned from other methods
   such as user configuration.

   The 6204bis SPER will NOT forward packets from an unrecognized source
   address.   Any IPv6 packets routed from the Homenet would receive an
   ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable message.   A 6204bis SPER prevents any
   Routing mechanisms from working.


3.3.  Security

   A 6204 SPER is recommended to enable a stateful [RFC6092] firewall by
   default.  This stateful firewall will allow the homenet incoming
   traffic is limited to return traffic resulting from outgoing packets.

Internet-Draft                    SPER                      October 2013

   A Homenet Router with the firewall on might not allow valid traffic
   from devices connected to the 6204bis SPER.  When a Homenet Router
   detects a 6204bis SPER it should allow native IPv6 traffic thru the
   firewall so that traffic can flow between the 6204bis SPER and
   Homenet.

3.4.  Naming and Service Discovery

   A 6204bis SPER support the ability to assign DNS servers and Domain
   Search List.  A 6204bis SPER may support service discovery protocols
   such as mDNS/DNS-SD and SSDP.  These protocols will only work when
   directly connected to the 6204 SPER LAN interfaces.   There is
   currently no mechanism for sharing service discovery between the
   Homenet and IPv6 nodes connected to the LAN interfaces of the 6204
   SPER.

3.5.  Requirements

   TBD

4.  HIPnet Server Provider Edge Router (SPER)

4.1.  Addressing

   HIPnet SPER use DHCPv6 prefix sub-delegation to build the network
   [I-D.grundemann-homenet-hipnet] .  The HIPnet SPER receives IPv6
   prefix per [I-D.ietf-v6ops-6204bis].  If the prefix is larger then a
   single /64 prefix the HIPnet router will subdivide the IPv6 prefix
   received via DHCPv6 [RFC3315].  Using Recursive Prefix Delegation
   allows the Homenet to receive prefixes that can be used to address
   the network.

4.2.  Routing

   Leveraging the recursive prefix delegation method described above, a
   HIPnet SPER installs route to the WAN interface of the router
   delegated the prefixes.  With this routing information the HIPnet
   SPER is able to properly route packets to and from the Homenet.

4.3.  Security

   A HIPnet SPER must enable a stateful [RFC6092] firewall by default.
   This stateful firewall will allow the homenet incoming traffic is
   limited to return traffic resulting from outgoing packets.

   A Homenet Router with the firewall on might not allow valid traffic
   from devices connected to the HIPnet SPER.  When a Homenet Router
   detects a HIPnet SPER it should allow native IPv6 traffic thru the
   firewall so that traffic can flow between the HIPnet SPER and
   Homenet.

4.4.  Naming and Service Discovery

Internet-Draft                    SPER                      October 2013


   Both the Homenet and HIPnet have several common protocols that can be
   used for service discovery such as mDNS [RFC6762], DNS-SD [RFC6763],
   and SSDP.   Both the HIPnet and Homenet Routers may have host
   directly connected that are using them as DNS servers.  If the HIPnet
   SPER advertises itself as the DNS-SD server for connected host, the
   host could query the HIPnet SPER.   The issue that arises with this
   configuration is the HIPnet Router currently has no method for
   finding the Homenet router to query when trying to resolve DNS.
   Future revisions of this draft should try and resolve this issue.
