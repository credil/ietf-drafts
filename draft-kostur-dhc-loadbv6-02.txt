                DHC Load Balancing Algorithm for DHCPv6
                      draft-kostur-dhc-loadbv6-02

Abstract

   This document proposes a method of algorithmic load balancing for
   IPv6 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv6) traffic.  It
   enables multiple, cooperating servers to decide which one should
   service a client, without exchanging any information beyond initial
   configuration.  The server selection is based on the servers hashing
   client DHCP Unique Identifiers (DUIDs) when multiple DHCPv6 (DHCPv6)
   servers are available to service DHCPv6 clients.  The proposed
   technique provides for efficient server selection when multiple
   DHCPv6 servers offer services on a network without requiring any
   changes to existing DHCPv6 clients.  The same method is proposed to
   select the target server of a DHCPv6 relay.

Internet-Draft   DHC Load Balancing Algorithm for DHCPv6   November 2012


1.  Introduction

   This protocol is intended to extend the algorithm described in RFC
   3074 [RFC3074] to apply to DHCPv6 traffic.  Most of the terminology
   and procedures are identical to the ones specified in RFC 3074.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Background and External Requirements

   The requirements for DHCPv6 are substantially the same as for DHCPv4,
   replacing DHCPDISCOVER with SOLICIT, DHCPREQUEST with REQUEST,
   CONFIRM, RENEW, or REBIND (as appropriate), etc.


3.  Operation

   A DHCPv6 server performing this load balancing will operate in
   substantially the same manner as if it were a DHCPv4 server load
   balancing an incoming DHCPv4/BOOTP packet with the following two
   differences.

3.1.  Requests with a Server ID

   A DHCPv6 server receiving a RELEASE, DECLINE, or INFORMATION-REQUEST
   with the server's Server ID MUST NOT consider load balancing for the
   message.  Since there is no retry mechanism for RELEASE or DECLINE,
   or only a simple retransmit for INFORMATION-REQUEST, if the server
   were to ignore the message either the state of the address would be
   incorrect, or no information would be transferred to the client even
   though it was instructed to try the INFORMATION-REQEUST against this
   particular server.

   A DHCPv6 server receiving a RENEW with the server's Server ID
   specified MAY answer the request even if the request would normally
   be ignored by load balancing.  If there were a pair of cooperating
   DHCPv6 servers (perhaps a failover pair), and after a failure of one
   of the servers a large portion of the population may have bound to
   the second server.  When the first server returns to service, the
   clients will continue to Renew against the second server.  If the
   second server ignores the requests, eventually the client will
   transition to doing a Rebind, at which point since there is no Server
   ID specified, the first server could then answer the client.  The end

   result would be that the server loads would eventually become
   balanced again.

   If the secondary server is choosing to continue to respect the load
   balancing in the above case, then the server SHOULD NOT use the
   Delayed Service Parameter feature for the requests containing the
   server's Server ID.  If the Delayed Service Parameter was still being
   used, then it is likely that the client would never reach the
   Rebinding state, and the secondary server might as well have answered
   the first request that arrived instead of waiting for some number of
   seconds before answering.

   If the second server continues to answer the requests, then the
   server load will not rebalance until the clients are rebooted, or
   transition to a Rebind through any other mechanism.

3.2.  Selecting the STID

   DHCPv6 servers MUST use the client's DUID in its entirety as the
   STID.  This is different than RFC 3074 which limited the STID to 16
   bytes.

3.3.  Replacing the secs field

   A DHCPv6 server providing the capability of Delayed Service SHOULD
   use the value in the OPTION_ELAPSED_TIME wherever RFC 3074 makes
   reference to the secs field.


4.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Bernie Volz, Steve Gonczi, Ted Lemon, and Rob Stevens as
   this document heavily borrows from their previous work on RFC 3074,
   and Bernie's additional comments during the discussions.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   This proposal in and by itself provides no security, nor does it
   impact existing security.  Servers using this algorithm are
   responsible for ensuring that if the contents of the HBA are
   transmitted over the network as part of the process of configuring
   any server, that message be secured against tampering, since

   tampering with the HBA could result in denial of service for some or
   all clients.
