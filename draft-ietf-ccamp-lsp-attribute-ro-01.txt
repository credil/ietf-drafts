                  draft-ietf-ccamp-lsp-attribute-ro-01

Abstract

   LSP attributes can be specified or recorded for whole path, but they
   cannot be targeted to a specific hop.  This document proposes
   alternative ways to extend the semantic for RSVP ERO object to target
   LSP attributes to a specific hop.

1.  Introduction

   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched
   Paths (LSPs) can be route-constrained by making use of the Explicit
   Route (ERO) object and related sub-objects as defined in [RFC3209],
   [RFC3473], [RFC3477], [RFC4873], [RFC4874], [RFC5520] and [RFC5553].
   Those route constraints are extended by a number of documents,
   including element defined in [RFC6163],
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-wson-signaling],
   [I-D.dong-ccamp-rsvp-te-mpls-tp-li-lb] or
   [I-D.ali-ccamp-rc-objective-function-metric-bound].

   RSVP already supports generic extension of LSP attributes in
   [RFC5420].  In order to support current and future ERO constraint
   extensions this document defines a mechanism to target LSP attributes
   at a specific hop.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Requirements

   The requirement is to provide a generic mechanism to carry
   information related to specific nodes when signaling an LSP.  This
   document does not restrict what that information can be used for.
   LSP attribute defined [RFC5420] should be expressed in ERO and SERO
   objects.

3.  ERO LSP Attribute Subobject

   The ERO LSP Attributes subobject may be carried in the ERO or SERO
   object if they are present.  The subobject uses the standard format
   of an ERO subobject.

3.1.  ERO LSP_ATTRIBUTE subobject

   The length is variable and content MUST be the same as for the
   LSP_ATTRIBUTE object with Attributes TLVs.  The size of the ERO sub-
   object limits the size of the LSP Attribute TLV to 250 bytes.  The
   typical size of currently defined and forthcoming LSP_ATTRIBUTE TLVs
   applicable to a specific hop (WSON_SIGNALING, OF and Metric) is not
   foreseen to exceed this limit.

   The ERO LSP attribute subobject is defined as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |L|    Type     |     Length    |    Reserved                 |R|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                                                               |
      //                      Attributes TLVs                        //
      |                                                               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   See [RFC3209] for a description of L parameters.  The attributes TLV
   are encoded as defined in [RFC5420] section 3.

   Type  x TBD by IANA.

   Length  The Length contains the total length of the subobject in
      bytes, including the Type and Length fields.  The Length MUST be
      always divisible by 4.

   Reserved  Reserved, must be set to 0 when the subobject is inserted
      in the ERO, MUST NOT be changed when a node process the ERO and
      must be ignored on the node addressed by the preceding ERO
      subobjects.

   R  This bit reflects the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTE and LSP_ATTRIBUTE
      semantic.  When set indicates required LSP attributes to be
      processed by the node, when cleared the LSP attributes are not
      required as described in Section 3.2.

   Attributes TLVs  as defined in [RFC5420] section 3.

3.2.  Procedures

   As described in [RFC3209] and [RFC3473] the ERO is managed as a list
   where each hop information starts with a subobject identifying an
   abstract node or link.  The LSP attribute subobject must be appended
   after the existing subobjects defined in [RFC3209], [RFC3473],
   [RFC3477], [RFC4873], [RFC4874], [RFC5520] and [RFC5553].  Several
   LSP attribute subobject MAY be present, for each hop.

   If a node is processing an LSP attribute subobject and does not
   support handling of the subobject it will behave as described in
   [RFC3209] when an unrecognized ERO subobject is encountered.  This
   node will return a PathErr with error code "Routing Error" and error
   value "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE object" with the EXPLICIT_ROUTE object
   included, truncated (on the left) to the offending unrecognized
   subobject.

   When the R bit is set a node MUST examine the attribute TLV present
   in the subobject following the rules described in [RFC5420] section
   5.2.  When the R bit is not set a node MUST examine the attribute TLV
   present in the subobject following the rules described in [RFC5420]
   section 4.2.

   A node processing an LSP attribute subobject with an LSP_ATTRIBUTE
   TLV longer than the ERO subobject SHOULD return a PathErr with error
   code "Routing Error" and error value "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE object" with
   the EXPLICIT_ROUTE object included, truncated (on the left) to the
   offending malformed subobject.  The processing of the LSP_ATTRIBUTE
   TLVs should be described in the documents defining them.
