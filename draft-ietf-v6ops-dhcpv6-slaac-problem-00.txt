                draft-ietf-v6ops-dhcpv6-slaac-problem-00

Abstract

   This document analyzes the DHCPv6/SLAAC interaction issue on host.
   More specifically, the interaction is regarding with the A, M, and O
   flags defined in ND protocol. Test results identify that current
   implementations in operating systems have varied on interpreting
   these flags. The variation might cause some operational issues as
   described in the document.

1.  Introduction

   In IPv6, both of the DHCPv6 [RFC3315] and Neighbor Discovery
   [RFC4861] protocols could be utilized for automatic IP address
   configuration for the hosts.  They are known as stateful address
   auto-configuration and stateless address auto-configuration (SLAAC (,
   [RFC4862]).  Sometimes the two address configuration methods might be
   both available in one network.

   In ND protocol, there is an M (Managed) flag defined in RA message,
   indicating the hosts there is DHCPv6 service available when the flag
   is set.  And there is an O (OtherConfig) flag indicating configure

   information other than addresses (e.g. DNS, Route .etc) is available
   through DHCPv6 configuration when it is set.  Moreover, there's
   another A (Autonomous) flag defined in ND, which indicating the hosts
   to do SLAAC.

   So with these flags, the two address configuration methods are
   correlated.  But for some reasons, the ND protocol didn't define the
   flags as prescriptive but only advisory.  This means the definition
   is more or less ambiguous, and hosts might vary the behavior of
   interpreting the flags because of the ambiguity.  In the appendix, we
   provided test results to identify different host operating systems
   have taken different approaches.  This might cause some operational
   issues as analyzed in section 3.

2.  Host Behavior of DHCPv6/SLAAC Interaction

   In this section, we analyze A, M, and O flags definition, and briefly
   point out some important test results of host behavior of
   interpreting these flags in mainstream operating systems
   implementations.

   Please note that, A flag has no direct relationship with DHCPv6, but
   it is somewhat correlated with M and O flags.

2.1.  Relevant RA Flags Defined in Standards

2.1.1.  A (Autonomous) Flag

   In ND Prefix Information Option, when the autonomous address-
   configuration flag (A flag) is set, it indicates that this prefix can
   be used for SLAAC.

   For the host behavior, there is an explicit rule in the SLAAC
   specification [RFC4862]: "If the Autonomous flag is not set, silently
   ignore the Prefix Information option."

   But when A flag is set, the SLAAC protocol didn't provide a
   prescriptive definition.  It is not clear the host "could" do SLAAC
   or "must" do.

2.1.2.  M (Managed) Flag

   In earlier SLAAC specification [RFC2462], the host behavior of
   interpreting M flag is as below:

   "On receipt of a valid Router Advertisement, a host copies the value
   of the advertisement's M bit into ManagedFlag.  If the value of
   ManagedFlag changes from FALSE to TRUE, and the host is not already

Internet-Draft               DHCPv6/SLAAC PS               November 2013


   running the stateful address autoconfiguration protocol, the host
   should invoke the stateful address auto-configuration protocol,
   requesting both address information and other information.  If the
   value of the ManagedFlag changes from TRUE to FALSE, the host should
   continue running the stateful address auto-configuration, i.e., the
   change in the value of the ManagedFlag has no effect.  If the value
   of the flag stays unchanged, no special action takes place.  In
   particular, a host MUST NOT reinvoke stateful address configuration
   if it is already participating in the stateful protocol as a result
   of an earlier advertisement."

   But in the current SLAAC specification [RFC4862], the relative
   description was removed, the reason was "considering the maturity of
   implementations and operational experiences.  ManagedFlag and
   OtherConfigFlag were removed accordingly.  (Note that this change
   does not mean the use of these flags is deprecated.)".

2.1.3.  O (Otherconfig) Flag

   As mentioned above, the situation of O flag is similar with M. In
   earlier SLAAC [RFC2462], the host behavior is clear:

   "If the value of OtherConfigFlag changes from FALSE to TRUE, the host
   should invoke the stateful autoconfiguration protocol, requesting
   information (excluding addresses if ManagedFlag is set to FALSE).  If
   the value of the OtherConfigFlag changes from TRUE to FALSE, the host
   should continue running the stateful address autoconfiguration
   protocol, i.e., the change in the value of OtherConfigFlag has no
   effect.  If the value of the flag stays unchanged, no special action
   takes place.  In particular, a host MUST NOT reinvoke stateful
   configuration if it is already participating in the stateful protocol
   as a result of an earlier advertisement."

   And there's another description of the relationship of M and O flags
   in [RFC2462]:

   "In addition, when the value of the ManagedFlag is TRUE, the value of
   OtherConfigFlag is implicitly TRUE as well.  It is not a valid
   configuration for a host to use stateful address autoconfiguration to
   request addresses only, without also accepting other configuration
   information."

2.2.  Behavior of Current Implementations

   We did tests of current mainstream desktop/mobile operating systems'
   behavior (please refer to the appendix for details).  This section
   only briefly illustrates some important results.

Internet-Draft               DHCPv6/SLAAC PS               November 2013


2.2.1.  A flag

   A flag is a switch to control whether to do SLAAC, and it is
   independent with M/O flags, in another word, A is independent with
   DHCPv6.

   At the non-SLAAC-config state (including DHCPv6-only-configured), all
   the OSes acted the same with A flag, if A set, they all configured
   SLAAC, it is obvious and reasonable.  But when hosts are SLAAC-
   configured, and A changed from 1 to 0, the behavior varied, some
   deprecated SLAAC while some ignored the RA messages.

2.2.2.  M flag

   M is a key flag to correlate ND and DHCPv6, but the host behavior on
   M flag is quite different.

   In our test, there was one OS treating the flag as prescriptive, it
   even released DHCPv6 session when M=0.  But the others just treat the
   flag as advisory, when SLAAC was done, it won't care about M=1, and
   M=0 won't cause operation for the already configured DHCPv6
   addresses.  Moreover, the two OSes even would not initiate DHCPv6
   session until they receives RA messages with M=1, this behavior has
   an implication that DHCPv6 somehow depends on ND.

2.2.3.  O flag

   In our tests, when M flag is set, the O flag is implicitly set as
   well; in another word, the hosts would not initial stateful DHCPv6
   and stateless DHCPv6 respectively.  This is reasonable behavior.

   But the O flag could be influented by A flag in some OSes.  In our
   test, there are two OSes that won't initiate stateless DHCPv6 when A
   flag is not set, that is to say, it is not applicable to have a
   ''stateless DHCPv6 only'' configuration state for some operating
   systems; it is also not applicable for these two OSes to switch
   between stateful DHCPv6 and stateless DHCPv6 (according to O flag
   changing from 0 to 1 or verse vice).

3.  Possible Operational Issues of DHCPv6/SLAAC Interaction

   According to the abovementioned tests, there are possible operational
   issues as the following.

3.1.  Renumbering

   During IPv6 renumbering, the SLAAC-configured hosts could reconfigure
   IP addresses by receiving ND Router Advertisement (RA) messages



Liu, et al.               Expires May 30, 2014                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               DHCPv6/SLAAC PS               November 2013


   containing new prefix information.  The DHCPv6-configured hosts could
   reconfigure addresses by initialing RENEW sessions when the current
   addresses' lease time is expired or receiving the reconfiguration
   messages initiated by the DHCPv6 servers.

   So renumbering won't be a problem when SLAAC-configured hosts would
   remain SLAAC configuration as well as DHCPv6-managed hosts remaining
   DHCPv6.  But in some situations, SLAAC-configured hosts might need to
   switch to DHCPv6-managed, or verse vice.  In [RFC6879], it described
   several renumbering scenarios in enterprise network for this
   requirement; for example, the network may split, merge, relocate or
   reorganize.  But due to current implementations, this requirement is
   not applicable and has been identified as a gap in [RFC7010].

3.2.  Cold Start Problems

   If all nodes, or many nodes, restart at the same time after a power
   cut, the results might not consistent.

3.3.  Strong Management

   Since the host behavior of address configuration is un-controlled and
   un-predictable by the network side, it might cause gaps to the
   networks that need strong management (for example, the enterprise
   networks and the ISP CPE networks).  Examples are:

   o  the administrator wants the hosts to do DHCPv6-only configuration,
      it is not applicable for some operating systems due to current
      implementation unless manually configure the hosts to DHCPv6-only
      model

   o  the hosts have been SLAAC-configured, then the administrator wants
      the hosts to do DHCPv6 simultaneously (e.g. for multihoming)

   o  the administrator wants the hosts to do statelss DHCPv6-only; for
      example, the hosts are configured with self-generated addresses
      (e.g. ULA), and they also need to contact the DHCPv6 server for
      info- configuration

4.  Conclusions

   o  The host behavior of SLAAC/DHCPv6 interaction is ambiguous in
      standard.

   o  The implementations have been varied on this issue.  In [RFC4862]
      it is said "Removed the text regarding the M and O flags,
      considering the maturity of implementations and operational
      experiences."  The description seems not true anymore.

Internet-Draft               DHCPv6/SLAAC PS               November 2013


   o  It is foreseeable that the un-uniformed host behavior can cause
      operational issues, e.g. in renumbering and strong management.

5.  Security Considerations

   No more security considerations than the Neighbor Discovery protocol
   [RFC4861].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This draft does not request any IANA action.

      *  A=0&M=O&O=0, non-config

      *  A=1&M=0&O=0, SLAAC only

      *  A=1&M=0&O=1, SLAAC + Stateless DHCPv6

      *  A=1&M=1&O=0, SLAAC + DHCPv6

      *  A=1&M=1&O=1, SLAAC + DHCPv6

      *  A=0&M=1&O=0, DHCPv6 only (A=0 or Non-PIO)

      *  A=0&M=1&O=1, DHCPv6 only (A=0 or Non-PIO)

      *  A=0&M=0&O=1, Stateless DHCPv6 only

   o  Linux/MAC OS X

      *  A=0&M=O&O=0, non-config

      *  A=1&M=0&O=0, SLAAC only

      *  A=1&M=0&O=1, SLAAC + Stateless DHCPv6

      *  A=1&M=1&O=0, SLAAC + DHCPv6

Internet-Draft               DHCPv6/SLAAC PS               November 2013


      *  A=1&M=1&O=1, SLAAC + DHCPv6

      *  A=0&M=1&O=0, DHCPv6 only (A=0 or Non-PIO)

      *  A=0&M=1&O=1, DHCPv6 only (A=0 or Non-PIO)

      *  A=0&M=0&O=1, non-config

   As showed above, Linux and MAC OSX acted the same way, but differated
   from Windows 7 and Apple IOS.  The only difference is when
   A=0&M=0&O=1, Windows 7/Apple IOS did stateless DHCPv6 while Linux/MAC
   OSX did nothing.

   Result summary:

   o  A is interpreted as prescript in each OS at the initial state

   o  M is interpreted as prescript in each OS at the initial state

   o  O is interpreted as prescript in Windows 7

   o  A and M are independent in each OS at the initial state

   o  A and O are not totally independent in Linux and Mac, A=1 is
      required for O=1 triggering DHCPv6 info-request

   o  M and O are not totally independent in each OS.  M=1 has the
      implication O=1

A.1.  Host Transition Behavior

   o  SLAAC-only host receiving A=0&M=1

      *  Window 7 would deprecate SLAAC and initiate DHCPv6

      *  Linux/MAC/IOS would keep SLAAC and don't initiate DHCPv6 unless
         SLAAC is expired and no continuous RA

   o  DHCPv6-only host receiving A=1&M=0

      *  Window 7 would release DHCPv6 and do SLAAC

      *  Linux/MAC/IOS would keep DHCPv6 and do SLAAC

   When the host has been configured, either by SLAAC or DHCPv6, the
   operating systems interpreting the M flag quite differently.  Windows
   7 treats the flag as instruction, it even released DHCPv6 session
   when M=0.  Linux and OS X were likely to treat the flag as advisory,

   when SLAAC was done, it won't care about M=1, and M=0 won't cause
   operation for the already configured DHCPv6 addresses.

   Please refer to [I-D.liu-6renum-dhcpv6-slaac-switching] for more
   details.

A.2.  Host Stateful/Stateless DHCPv6 Behavior

   o  Stateless DHCPv6-configured host receiving M=1 (while keeping O=1)

      *  Window 7 would initiate stateful DHCPv6, configuring address as
         well as re-configuring other information

      *  Linux/MAC/IOS no action

   o  Statefull DHCPv6-configured host receiving M=0 (while keeping O=1)

      *  Window 7 would release all DHCPv6 configurations including
         address and other information, and initiate stateless DHCPv6

      *  Linux/MAC/IOS no action
