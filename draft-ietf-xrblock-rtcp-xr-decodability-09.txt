Abstract

   An MPEG2 Transport Stream (TS) is a standard container format used in
   the transmission and storage of multimedia data.  Unicast/Multicast
   MPEG2 TS over RTP is widely deployed in IPTV systems.  This document
   defines an RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) Block
   that allows the reporting of MPEG2 TS Program Specific Information
   (PSI) Independent decodability statistics metrics related to
   transmissions of MPEG2 TS over RTP.

Internet-Draft           RTCP XR TS Decodability           February 2013


1.  Introduction

1.1.  MPEG2 Transport Stream Decodability Metrics

   The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has
   defined a set of syntax and information consistency tests and
   corresponding indicators [ETSI] that are recommended for the
   monitoring of MPEG2 Transport Streams [ISO-IEC.13818-1.2007].  The
   tests and corresponding indicators are grouped according to priority:

   o  First priority - Necessary for decodability (basic monitoring)
   o  Second priority - Recommended for continuous or periodic
      monitoring
   o  Third priority - Recommended for application-dependent monitoring

   This memo is based on information consistency tests and resulting
   indicators defined by ETSI [ETSI] and defines a new block type to
   augment those defined in Freidman, et al. [RFC3611] for use with
   MPEG2 Transport Stream (TS) [ISO-IEC.13818-1.2007].  The new block
   type supports reporting of the number of occurrences of each Program
   Specific Information (PSI) Independent indicator in the first and
   second priorities; third priority indicators are not supported.

1.2.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]
   defined an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This document defines a new Extended Report block for
   use with [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].

1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework

   The Performance Metrics Framework [RFC6390] provides guidance on the
   definition and specification of performance metrics.  The RTP
   Monitoring Architectures [RFC6792] provides guideline for reporting
   block format using RTCP XR.  The new report block described in this
   memo is in compliance with the monitoring architecture specified in
   [RFC6792] and the Performance Metrics Framework [RFC6390].

1.4.  Applicability

   These metrics are applicable to any type of RTP application that uses
   the MPEG2 TS standard format for multimedia data; for example, MPEG4
   over MPEG2 TS over RTP.  This new block type can be useful for
   measuring content stream or TS quality by checking TS header
   information [ETSI] and identifying the existence, and characterizing
   the severity, of bitstream packetization problems which may affect
   users' perception of a service delivered over RTP; it may also be

   useful for verifying the continued correct operation of an existing
   system management tool.


2.  Terminology

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  MPEG2 TS PSI Independent Decodability Statistics Metrics Block

   This block reports MPEG2 TS PSI Independent decodability statistics
   metrics beyond the information carried in the standard RTCP packet
   format, which are measured at the receiving end of the RTP stream.
   It describes eight metrics specified in ETSI TR 101 290.  Information
   is reported about basic monitoring parameters necessary to ensure
   that the TS can be decoded including:

   o  Transport Stream Synchronization Losses
   o  Sync byte errors
   o  Continuity count errors

   and continuous monitoring parameters necessary to ensure the
   continuous decoding including:

   o  Transport errors
   o  Program Clock Reference (PCR) errors
   o  PCR repetition errors
   o  PCR discontinuity indicator errors
   o  PCR accuracy errors
   o  Presentation Time Stamp (PTS) errors

   The other parameters are ignored since they do not apply to all MPEG2
   implementations.  For further information on these parameters, see
   [ETSI].

   The MPEG2 TS PSI Independent Decodability Metrics Block has the
   following format:

4.  SDP Signaling

   RFC 3611 defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol)
   [RFC4566] for signaling the use of RTCP XR blocks.  However XR blocks
   MAY be used without prior signaling (See section 5 of RFC3611).

4.1.  SDP rtcp-xr-attrib Attribute Extension

   This session augments the SDP attribute "rtcp-xr" defined in Section
   5.1 of RFC 3611 by providing an additional value of "xr-format" to
   signal the use of the report block defined in this document.

   xr-format =/  xr-tpid-block

   xr-tpid-block = "ts-psi-indep-decodability"

4.2.  Offer/Answer Usage

   When SDP is used in offer-answer context, the SDP Offer/Answer usage
   defined in [RFC3611] for unilateral "rtcp-xr" attribute parameters
   applies.  For detailed usage of Offer/Answer for unilateral
   parameter, refer to section 5.2 of [RFC3611].


5.  IANA Considerations

   New report block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.
   For general guidelines on IANA allocations for RTCP XR, refer to
   Section 6.2 of RFC 3611.

5.1.  New RTCP XR Block Type value

   This document assigns the block type value MTPID in the IANA " RTP
   Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR) Block Type Registry " to
   the "MPEG2 Transport Stream PSI Independent Decodability Statistics
   Metrics Block".

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace MPITD with the IANA provided RTCP
   XR block type for this block.]

5.2.  New RTCP XR SDP Parameter

   This document also registers a new parameter "ts-psi-indep-
   decodability" in the "RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters Registry".

5.3.  Contact information for registrations

   The contact information for the registrations is:
