    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>In [I.D-ietf-nvo3-framework],one control component is defined to
      provide the capability for Address advertisement and tunnel mapping. In
      [I.D-fw-nvo3-server2vcenter],the control interface between NVE and
      interconnection functionality is defined to provide the capability:
      <list style="symbols">
          <t>Enforce the network policy for each VM in the path from the NVE
          Edge associated with VM to the Tenant End System.</t>

          <t>Populate forwarding table in the path from the NVE Edge
          associated with VM to the Tenant End System in the data center.</t>

          <t>Populate mapping table in each NVE Edge that is in the virtual
          network across data centers under the control of the Director.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>However, there is no relevant work to discuss how those capability
      can be realized at the NVEs. This document goes into details to discuss
      how to provide control plane and forward plane information to the NVE
      associated with the tenant system for enabling interconnect between
      Tenant Systems that belong to specific tenant network.</t>

    <section title="Solution Overview">
      <t>This document addresses how to provide control plane and forward
      plane information to the NVE associated with the tenant system for
      enabling interconnect between Tenant Systems that belong to specific
      tenant network.</t>

      <t>Figure 1 shows the example architecture for interconnection between
      tenant systems. This example architecture assumes that:<list
          style="symbols">
          <t>One tenant system or a NVE may belong to one tenant VN or several
          tenant VNs, e.g., VMa and NVE Edge4 belong to both VN2 and VN3.</t>

          <t>If one tenant system belongs to multiple tenant VNs, it may
          connect to each tenant VN by being attached to one NVE or multiple
          NVEs,e.g., VM1 connect to VN1 by being attached to NVE Edge 1.</t>

          <t>One site may belong to one tenant VN or several tenant VN, e.g.,
          Site 2 belong to both VN2 and VN3.</t>

          <t>if one tenant system in one VN want to communicate with one
          tenant system in another VN, the interconnection functionality
          should get involved to setup tunnel between the interconnection
          functionality and the NVEs associated with the tenant system.</t>

    <section title="Mapping tables at the NVE">
      <t>Every NVE pair( local NVE and remote NVE ) associated with the tenant
      system MUST maintain a mapping table entry for each currently attached
      tenant system. Each mapping table entry conceptually contains the
      following fields:<list style="symbols">

          during the tunnel creation.</t>

          address is obtained from auto-discovery protocol between Tenant
          System and its local NVE.</t>

      <section title="Create and Update tenant Virtual Network (VN)">
        <t>The tenant virtualization network(VN) is a collection of tenant
        systems, Network Virtualization Edges (NVE)(s) and end systems that
        are interconnected with each other. The tenant VN also consists of a
        set of sites where each can send traffic directly to the other.</t>

        <t>In order to create or update a tenant VN, when a Tenant System is
        attached to a local NVE, the tenant system should inform the attached
        local NVE which VN the tenant system belong to. <list style="symbols">
            <t>If the tenant system are the first participant in the VN
            through the local NVE, the tenant system and associated local NVE
            should be firstly added to the VN and the mapping table should be
            setup at the local NVE for each attached tenant system.</t>

            <t>If both the tenant system and the local NVE are not on the VN,
            the tenant system and associated local should be firstly added to
            the VN and then the mapping table associated with this tenant
            system should be setup at the local NVE and distributed to the
            other remote NVEs that belong to the same VN.</t>

            <t>If the local NVE is on the same tenant VN as the tenant system
            associated with the local NVE, only the tenant system needs to be
            added into the VN, i.e., the local NVE only needs to distribute
            mapping table at the local NVE to the other remote NVEs that
            belong to the same tenant VN.</t>

            <t>If the local NVE is not on the same tenant VN as the tenant
            system associated with that local NVE, the local NVE should
            firstly be added into the VN and then distributes the new mapping
            table at the local NVE to the other remote NVEs that belong to the
            same tenant VN.</t>

            <t>If one tenant system is the last participant connecting to the
            VN through local NVE, when this tenant system leave the VN, the
            local NVE associated with this tenant system should be removed
            from the VN.The mapping table associated with this tenant system
            should be removed from the local NVE associated with this tenant
            system.</t>

      <section title="Associate the NVE and tenant system with VN context">
        <t>The VN context includes a set of configuration attributes defining
        access and tunnel policies and (L2 and/or L3) forwarding functions.
        When a Tenant System is attached to a local NVE, a VN network instance
        should be allocated to the local NVE. The tenant system should be
        associated with the specific VN context using virtual Network
        Instance(VNI). The tenant system should also inform the attached local
        NVE which VN context the tenant system belong to. Therefore the VN
        context can be bound with the data path from the tenant system to the
        local NVE and the tunnel from local NVE associated with the tenant
        system and all the remote NVEs that belong to the same VN as the local
        NVE. For the data path from the tenant system and the local NVE, the
        network policy can be installed on the underlying switched network and
        forwarding tables also can be populated to each network elements in
        the underlying network based on the specific VNI associated with the
        tenant system. For the tunnel from local NVE to the remote NVEs, the
        traffic engineering information can be applied to each tunnel based on
        VNI associated with the tenant system.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Populate mapping tables at the local NVE">
        <t>In some cases, two tenant systems may be attached to the same local
        NVE. In order to allow the NVE to locally route traffic between two
        tenant systems that are attached to the same NVE, the mapping table
        that maps a final destination address to the proper tunnel should be
        populated at the local NVE.</t>

        <t>In some cases, two tenant systems may connect to the different VNs
        through the same interconnection functionality, in order to allow two
        tenant systems communication between two VNs, the mapping table that
        maps a final destination address to the proper tunnel should be
        populated in both NVE associated with two communicated tenant system
        and the interconnection functionality associated corresponding
        NVE.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Distribute the mapping table to remote NVEs in the VN">
        <t>When the packet sent from one tenant system arrives at the ingress
        NVE associated with that tenant system, in order to determine which
        tunnel the packet needs to be sent to, the mapping table that maps a
        final destination address to the proper tunnel should also be
        distributed to all the remote NVEs in the VN using a control plane
        protocol or dynamic data plane learning. The mapping table may be
        advertised directly to other remote NVEs that belong to the same VN or
        firstly advertised to the centralized controller that maintain global
        view of NVEs that belong to the same VN and then let the centralized
        controller distribute the mapping tables to all the relevant remote
        NVEs that belong to the same VN.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="The mapping table update at the NVE when VM moves or connection fails">
        <t>In some cases, one tenant system may be detached from one NVE and
        move to another NVE. In such cases, the mapping table should be
        removed from the NVE to which the tenant system was previously
        attached and the new mapping table should be created at the new NVE to
        which the tenant system is currently attached. Such mapping table
        should be updated at each remote NVE associated with the tenant system
        and the new NVE.</t>

        <t>In some cases, one tenant system may fail to connect to the VN
        through the NVE. In such cases, the mapping table should be removed
        from the NVE to which the tenant system is currently attached. In
        addition, the mapping table should be updated at each remote NVE in
        the same VN through which the tenant system is communicating with the
        destination tenant system.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="The VN context re-association at the NVE when VM moves">
        <t>In some cases, one tenant system may be detached from one NVE and
        move to another NVE. In such cases, the VN context should be moved
        from the NVE to which the tenant system was previously attached to the
        new NVE to which the tenant system is currently attached. In order to
        achieve this, the per tenant system VN context can be maintained at
        the centralized database and be retrieved at the new place based on
        the VN Identifier (VNID).</t>
