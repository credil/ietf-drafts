The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) uses DNS procedures to allow a
client to resolve a SIP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) into the IP
address, port, and transport protocol of the next hop to contact.  It
also uses DNS to allow a server to send a response to a backup client
if the primary client has failed.  This document describes those DNS
procedures in detail.

This document is a product of the Session Initiation Protocol Working
Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
