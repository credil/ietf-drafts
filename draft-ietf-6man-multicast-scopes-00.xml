      The multicast protocol specification in <xref

      "domain")</xref>.  The use of this scop value is to accommodate
      a multicast scope that is greater than Link-Local but is also
      automatically determined by the network architecture; for
      example, all of the hosts and routers in a multi-link subnet RPL

<![CDATA[
      Realm-Local scope is the largest scope that is automatically
      configured, i.e., automatically derived from physical
      connectivity or other, non-multicast-related configuration.
      According to <xref target="RFC4007">RFC&nbsp;4007</xref>, the
      zone of a Realm-Local scope must fall within zones of larger
      scope.  Because the zone of a Realm-Local scope is configured
      automatically, while the zones of larger scopes are configured
      manually, care must be taken in the definition of those larger
      scopes to ensure that inclusion contraint is met.

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
