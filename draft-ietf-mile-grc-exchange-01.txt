                          GRC Report Exchange
                  draft-ietf-mile-grc-exchange-01.txt

Abstract

   Governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) programs provide oversight
   (governance) of risks and compliance initiatives within an
   organization.  GRC reports are increasingly provided in an XML
   format.  This specification defines a common method to securely
   transport GRC and other XML reports.  The defined messaging
   capability provides policy options and markings in an XML schema,
   options for confidentiality at the document/report level, and
   security for the end-to-end communication.  XML reports may be shared
   between service providers and clients, enterprises, or within
   enterprises.  Reports may also be exchanged for official purposes
   such as business report filings, compliance report filings, and the
   handling of legal incidents (eWarrant, eDiscovery, etc.)  This work
   is a generalized format derived from the secure exchange of incident
   information defined by RFC6545, Real-time Inter-network Defense
   (RID).

1.  Introduction

   Governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) programs provide oversight
   (governance) of risks and compliance initiatives within an
   organization.  The areas typically covered by GRC include:

   o  Finance and Business Operations,

   o  Information Technology,

   o  Security, and

   o  Legal and Compliance

   GRC Report Exchange provides a secure method to communicate relevant
   information and reports, through the automated exchange of extensible
   markup language (XML) documents.  GRC Report Exchange considers
   security, policy, and privacy issues as related to the exchange of
   potentially sensitive information.  Additionally, it enables
   organizations accepting GRC report filings, such as service providers
   or enterprises, the options to make appropriate decisions according
   to their policy requirements.  GRC Report Exchange includes
   provisions for confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.

   The data in GRC reports exchanged are represented in an XML
   [W3C.REC-xml-20081126] document using the appropriate XML schema for
   the included report.  The XML document or formatted report is then
   enveloped by the GRC Report Exchange schema to set policy options and
   provide a common secure exchange method for such documents.  By
   following this model, a single method for all GRC reports can be
   used, simplifying the integration of GRC reports across platforms.

   Security and privacy considerations are of high concern since
   potentially sensitive information may be passed through GRC Report
   Exchange messages.  GRC Report Exchange takes advantage of XML
   security and privacy policy information set in the GRC Report
   Exchange schema and provides standard settings for fine grain
   controls within GRC XML schemas.  The GRC Report Exchange schema acts
   as an XML envelope to support the communication of GRC report
   documents.  GRC Report Exchange messages are encapsulated for
   transport, which is defined in a separate document [RFC6546].  The
   authentication, integrity, and authorization features GRC Report
   Exchange and RID transport offer are used to achieve a necessary
   level of security.

   GRC report exchange is not strictly a technical problem.  There are
   numerous procedural, trust, and legal considerations that might
   prevent an organization from sharing information.  GRC Report

   Exchange provides information and options that can be used by
   organizations who must then apply their own policies for sharing
   information.  Organizations must develop policies and procedures for
   the use of the GRC Report Exchange protocol and XML reports.

1.1.  Normative and Informative

   The XML schema [W3C.REC-xmlschema-1-20041028] and transport
   requirements contained in this document are normative; all other
   information provided is intended as informative.  More specifically,
   the following sections of this document are intended as informative:
   Sections XXX.  The following sections of this document are normative:
   Sections XXX.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Report Types

   There are many possible report types that may be exchanged using GRC
   Report Exchange.  The reports MUST all be XML formatted reports and
   MAY leverage the data markings used by this specification to require
   security options such as encryption on the entire report (XML
   document) or a section of the report.

   The types of reports may vary within each area of GRC.  Example
   report types broken out by GRC focus areas include:

   o  Finance and Business Operations

      *  Finance or business Filing Report

   o  Information Technology

      *  Service Level Agreement (SLA) Reports from service providers
         (public cloud providers, community cloud providers, etc.)

   o  Security

      *  Security Report aligned to control requirements (ISO27002, NIST
         800-53, etc.) from service providers

Internet-Draft                grc-exchange                 November 2012


   o  Legal and Compliance

      *  eDiscovery Reports

      *  eWarrant Reports

      *  Compliance report aligned to specific regulations

      *  Report for internal or external audit aligned to risk and
         control frameworks (ISO27002, NIST 800-53, COSO, COBIT, etc.)


3.  Communication between Entities

   Trust relationships.  Service provider to tenant or client is the
   most likely scenario for the initial use cases of GRC report
   exchange.  See Section 11.5 on profiles.

3.1.  Inter-network Provider GRC Messaging

   GRC Report Exchange provides a standard protocol and format that is
   required to ensure inter-operability between vendors for the exchange
   and filing of GRC reports.  GRC Report Exchange provides the
   framework necessary for communication between entities exchanging or
   filing GRC reports.  Several message types described in Section 6 are
   necessary to facilitate the exchange or filing of reports.  The
   message types include the Report, Query, Acknowledgement, Result, and
   the Request message.

   The Report message is used when a GRC report is to be filed on a
   system or associated database accepting GRC Report Exchange messages,
   where no further action is required.  A Query message is used to
   request information on a particular report.  The Acknowledgement and
   Report messages are used to communicate the status and result of a
   Query or Request message.

   Use of the communication network and the GRC Report Exchange protocol
   must be for pre-approved, authorized purposes only.  It is the
   responsibility of each participating party to adhere to guidelines
   set forth in both a global use policy established through the peering
   agreements for each bilateral peer or agreed-upon consortium
   guidelines.  The purpose of such policies is to avoid abuse of the
   system; the policies shall be developed by a consortium of
   participating entities.  The global policy may be dependent on the
   domain it operates under; for example, a government network or a
   commercial network such as the Internet would adhere to different
   guidelines to address the individual concerns.  Privacy issues must
   be considered in public networks such as the Internet.  Privacy

Internet-Draft                grc-exchange                 November 2012


   issues are discussed in the Security Requirements section
   (Section 11), along with other requirements that must be agreed upon
   by participating entities.

   The GRC Report Exchange system should be configurable to either
   require user input or automatically provide or file reports.  If the
   trust relationship is not strong, it may not be in the peer's best
   interest to accept a report or respond to a request.  The trust
   relationship may evolve over time through experience working with a
   peer and knowledge and review of their policies and operating
   procedures.

3.2.  GRC Report Exchange Communication Topology

   The most basic topology for communicating GRC Report Exchanges is a
   direct connection or a bilateral relationship as illustrated below.

           ______________                     _____________
           |            |                     |           |
           |  GRC-RE    |_____________________|  GRC-RE   |
           |____________|                     |___________|

                      Figure 1: Direct Peer Topology

   A star topology may be desirable in instances where a peer may be a
   provider of GRC Reports.  This requires trust relationships to be
   established between the provider of information and each of the
   consumers of that information.  Examples may include clients that
   file compliance or business reports to an authoritative entity.

   The examples provided serve as an initial baseline set of expected
   topologies that may change over time.

3.3.  Message Formats

   Section 6 describes the five GRC Report Exchange message types, to be
   used with the appropriate XML documents.  The messages are expected
   to be generated and received on designated systems for GRC report
   exchanges.

3.4.  GRC Report Exchange Data Types

3.4.1.  Boolean

   A boolean value is represented by the BOOLEAN data type.

   The BOOLEAN data type is implemented as "xs:boolean"
   [W3C.REC-xmlschema-1-20041028] in the schema.

Internet-Draft                grc-exchange                 November 2012


3.4.2.  Language

   A language value is represented by the LANG data type.

   The LANG data type is a valid language code per [RFC5646] constrained
   by the definition of "xs:language" [W3C.REC-xmlschema-1-20041028]
   inherited from [W3C.REC-xml-20081126].

3.4.3.  Multilingual Strings

   STRING data that represents multi-character attributes in a language
   different than the default encoding of the document is of the
   ML_STRING data type.

   The ML_STRING data type is implemented as an "grc-
   exchange:MLStringType" in the schema.

   The base definition of this type is reused from the IODEF
   specification [RFC5070], Section 2.4.  This definition is fully
   included in the GRC-Exchange specification in Section 4.8 to prevent
   the need to use the IODEF schema.

3.4.4.  Uniform Resource Locator strings

   A uniform resource locator (URL) is represented by the URL data type.
   The format of the URL data type is documented in [RFC3986].

   The URL data type is implemented as an "xs:anyURI"
   [W3C.REC-xmlschema-1-20041028] in the schema.

3.4.5.  Date-Time Strings

   Date-time strings are represented by the DATETIME data type.  Each
   date-time string identifies a particular instant in time; ranges are
   not supported.

   Date-time strings are formatted according to a subset of ISO 8601:
   2004 [ISO.8601.2000] documented in [RFC3339].

   The DATETIME data type is implemented as an "xs:dateTime"
   [W3C.REC-xmlschema-1-20041028] in the schema.

   The base definition of this type is reused from the IODEF
   specification [RFC5070], Section 2.8.  This definition is fully
   included in the GRC-Exchange specification in Section 4.8 to prevent
   the need to use the IODEF schema.

3.4.6.  Timezone String

   A timezone offset from UTC is represented by the TIMEZONE data type.
   It is formatted according to the following regular expression:
   "Z|[\+\-](0[0-9]|1[0-4]):[0-5][0-9]".

   The TIMEZONE data type is implemented as an "xs:string"
   [W3C.REC-xmlschema-1-20041028] with a regular expression constraint
   in the schema.  This regular expression is identical to the timezone
   representation implemented in an "xs:dateTime".

   The base definition of this type is reused from the IODEF
   specification [RFC5070], Section 2.9.  This definition is fully
   included in the GRC-Exchange specification in Section 4.8 to prevent
   the need to use the IODEF schema.

3.4.7.  Postal Address

   A postal address is represented by the POSTAL data type.  This data
   type is an ML_STRING whose format is documented in Section 2.23 of
   [RFC4519].  It defines a postal address as a free-form multi-line
   string separated by the "$" character.

   The POSTAL data type is implemented as an "xs:string"
   [W3C.REC-xmlschema-1-20041028] in the schema.

   The base definition of this type is reused from the IODEF
   specification [RFC5070], Section 2.11.  This definition is fully
   included in the GRC-Exchange specification in Section 4.8 to prevent
   the need to use the IODEF schema.

3.4.8.  Telephone and Fax Numbers

   A telephone or fax number is represented by the PHONE data type.  The
   format of the PHONE data type is documented in Section 2.35 of
   [RFC4519].

   The PHONE data type is implemented as an "xs:string"
   [W3C.REC-xmlschema-1-20041028] in the schema.

   The base definition of this type is reused from the IODEF
   specification [RFC5070], Section 2.13.  This definition is fully
   included in the GRC-Exchange specification in Section 4.8 to prevent
   the need to use the IODEF schema.

3.4.9.  Email String

   An email address is represented by the EMAIL data type.  The format
   of the EMAIL data type is documented in Section 3.4.1 of [RFC5322].

   The EMAIL data type is implemented as an "xs:string"
   [W3C.REC-xmlschema-1-20041028] in the schema.

   The base definition of this type is reused from the IODEF
   specification [RFC5070], Section 2.14.  This definition is fully
   included in the GRC-Exchange specification in Section 4.8 to prevent
   the need to use the IODEF schema.

3.5.  GRC Report Exchange Message Types

   The five GRC Report Exchange message types are as follows:

   1.  Acknowledgement.  This message is sent to the requestor of a
       report (Request) or in response to a Query to notify on the state
       of a request (approved, pending, not approved).

   2.  Result.  This message is sent to the requestor of a GRC report
       (Request) or in response to a Query.  The Result may contain the
       full report requested or a section of the report as appropriate
       for the request in the Query.

   3.  Request.  This message type is used to request a specific type of
       GRC report.  The Request MUST specify the XML schema and version
       for the requested report along with any other parameters required
       in the XML schema to generate the correct report.

   4.  Report.  This message is used to provide a GRC Report.  The
       message can be considered a wrapper for any approved GRC schema
       used to format a report for submission.

   5.  Query.  This message is used to request information about a
       specific GRC report.  The XML schema and version used MUST be
       specified along with any details required to provide the proper
       Report response.  The response is provided through the Report
       message.

   When an application receives a GRC Report Exchange message, it must
   be able to determine the type of message and parse it accordingly.
   The message type is specified in the GRCPolicy class.  The GRCPolicy
   class may also be used by the transport protocol to facilitate the
   secure communication of the GRC Report Exchange.

4.  GRC-Exchange Schema

   There are three classes included in the GRC Report Exchange schema
   required to facilitate communications.  The RequestStatus class is
   used to indicate the approval status of a report Request or Query;
   the GRCDocument class identifies the XML schema to be used by the
   provided or requested report; and the GRCPolicy class provides
   information on the agreed-upon policies and specifies the type of
   communication message being used.

   The GRC Report Exchange schema acts as an envelope for the GRC XML
   schema to facilitate secure GRC report communications.  The intent in
   maintaining a separate schema is for the flexibility of sending
   messages between participating entities.  Since GRC Report Exchange
   is a separate schema that includes the appropriate GRC XML schema,
   the GRC Report Exchange information acts as an envelope, and then the
   GRCPolicy class can be easily extracted for use by the transport
   protocol.

   The security requirements of sending GRC reports and associated
   information on finance, IT operations, legal, compliance, and
   security across the network include the use of confidentiality
   (encryption prior to the transport level), authentication
   (potentially multi-hop), integrity, and non-repudiation.  GRCPolicy
   uses labels that correspond to policy and agreements to standardize
   on handling requirements such as encryption and sharing limitations.
   The GRCPolicy information should not be encrypted, hence GRC Report
   Exchange is maintained separate from the GRC XML schema used to send
   or request a report.  This segregation enables flexibility for GRC
   Report Exchange to be used with any GRC XML schema and removes the
   need for decrypting and parsing the entire GRC Report and GRC Report
   Exchange document to determine how it should be handled at each
   entity communicating via GRC Report Exchange.

   The purpose of the GRCPolicy class is to specify the message type for
   the receiving host, facilitate the policy needs of GRC Reports, and
   provide routing information in the form of an IP address of the
   destination entity accepting GRC Report Exchange messages.

   The policy information and guidelines are discussed in Section
   Section 4.1.  The policy is defined between GRC-Exchange peers and
   within or between consortiums.  The GRCPolicy is meant to be a tool
   to facilitate the defined policies.  This MUST be used in accordance
   with policy set between clients, peers, consortiums, and/or regions.
   Security, privacy, and confidentiality MUST be considered as
   specified in this document.

   The GRC Report Exchange (GRC-Exchange) schema is defined as follows:

   The aggregate classes that constitute the GRC-Exchange schema in the
   grc-exchange namespace are as follows:

   GRCPolicy

      Zero or One. The GRCPolicy class is used by all message types to
      facilitate policy agreements between peers, consortiums, or
      federations, as well as to properly route messages.

   RequestStatus

      Zero or One. The RequestStatus class is used only in
      Acknowledgement messages to report back to the entity requesting a
      report or sending a report Query if the request is denied or
      remains in a pending state.

   GRCDocument

      Zero or One. The GRCDocument class is used in each of the message
      types to state the XML schema and version for the included XML
      report, XML report request, or response.

   The GRC-Exchange class defines one attribute as follows:

   lang

      REQUIRED.  ENUM.  A valid language code per [RFC5646] constrained
      by the definition of "xs:language" [W3C.REC-xmlschema-1-20041028]
      inherited from [W3C.REC-xml-20081126].

   Each of the three listed classes may be the only class included in
   the GRC-Exchange class, hence the option for zero or one.  In some
   cases, GRCPolicy MAY be the only class in the GRC-Exchange definition
   when used by the transport protocol [RFC6546], as that information
   should be as small as possible and may not be encrypted.  The
   Acknowledgement message using the RequestStatus class MUST be able to

   the communication, limiting the data transported to the required
   elements per [RFC6546].

   The GRCPolicy class facilitates the delivery of GRC Report Exchange
   messages.

                       Figure 3: The GRCPolicy Class

   The aggregate elements that constitute the GRCPolicy class are as
   follows:

   ReportID

      Zero or one.  Global reference pointing back to the ReportID
      defined in the GRC XML data model.  The ReportID includes the
      domain name of the entity who creates the report, a report number,
      and an instance of that report number.  The default report number
      is a date, where the requested report is the most recent report on
      or prior to the date specified.  The format for the date SHALL be
      YYYYMMDD, where Y is the year, M is the month, and D is the day.
      The instance number is appended with a dash separating the values
      and is used in cases for which there may be multiple reports
      issued in a day.  The format for the instance SHALL be HHMMSS,
      where H is the hour as specified in a 24hour range, M is the
      minute, S is the second provided in GMT.  An alternate ID may be
      specified within the GRC XML schema for the specific report.  This
      element has been derived from IODEF [RFC5070].

   Node

      One. The Node class is used to identify a host or network device,
      in this case to identify the system communicating GRC-Exchange

      IODEF specification [RFC5070], Section 3.16.  This definition is
      fully included in the GRC-Exchange specification in Section 4.8 to
      prevent the need to use the IODEF schema.

   PolicyRegion

      One or many.  REQUIRED.  The values for the attribute "region" are
      used to determine what policy area may require consideration
      before a trace can be approved.  The PolicyRegion may include
      multiple selections from the attribute list in order to fit all
      possible policy considerations when crossing regions, consortiums,
      or networks.

      region

         One. ENUM.

         1.  ClientToSP.  An enterprise initiated the request to their
             service provider.

         2.  SPToClient.  An service provider passed a GRC request or
             report to a client or an enterprise based on requested
             services or service level agreements.

         3.  IntraConsortium.  GRC report information that should have
             no restrictions within the boundaries of a consortium with
             the agreed-upon use and abuse guidelines.

         4.  PeerToPeer.  GRC report information that should have no
             restrictions between two peers but may require further
             evaluation before continuance beyond that point with the
             agreed-upon use and abuse guidelines.

         5.  BetweenConsortiums.  GRC report information that should
             have no restrictions between consortiums that have
             established agreed-upon use and abuse guidelines.

         6.  ext-value.  An escape value used to extend this attribute.
             This attribute has been derived from IODEF [RFC5070],
             Section 5.1 and is explained in Section 5, Extending the
             Enumerated Values of Attributes.

         Additionally, there is an extension attribute to add new
         enumerated values:

            ext-region.  An escape value used to extend this attribute.
            This attribute has been derived from IODEF [RFC5070] Section

            5.1 and is explained in Section 5, Extending the Enumerated
            Values of Attributes.

   The GRCPolicy class has six attributes:

      restriction

         Optional.  ENUM.  This attribute indicates the disclosure
         guidelines to which the sender expects the recipient to adhere
         for the information represented in this class and its children.
         This guideline provides no security since there are no
         specified technical means to ensure that the recipient of the
         document handles the information as the sender requested.

         The value of this attribute is logically inherited by the
         children of this class.  That is to say, the disclosure rules
         applied to this class, also apply to its children.

         It is possible to set a granular disclosure policy, since all
         of the high-level classes (i.e., children of the Incident
         class) have a restriction attribute.  Therefore, a child can
         override the guidelines of a parent class, be it to restrict or
         relax the disclosure rules (e.g., a child has a weaker policy
         than an ancestor; or an ancestor has a weak policy, and the
         children selectively apply more rigid controls).  The implicit
         value of the restriction attribute for a class that did not
         specify one can be found in the closest ancestor that did
         specify a value.

         This attribute is defined as an enumerated value with a default
         value of "private".  Note that the default value of the
         restriction attribute is only defined in the context of the
         GRCPolicy class.  In other classes where this attribute is
         used, no default is specified.

         This attribute is derived from IODEF [RFC5070] and is fully
         included within this schema.

         1.  public.  There are no restrictions placed in the
             information.

         2.  need-to-know.  The information may be shared with other
             parties that are involved in the incident as determined by
             the recipient of this document (e.g., multiple victim sites
             can be informed of each other).

         3.  private.  The information may not be shared.

         4.  default.  The information can be shared according to an
             information disclosure policy pre-arranged by the
             communicating parties.

         5.  ext-value.  An escape value used to extend this attribute.
             This attribute has been derived from IODEF [RFC5070],
             Section 5.1 and is explained in Section 5, Extending the
             Enumerated Values of Attributes.

      ext-restriction

         OPTIONAL.  STRING.  A means by which to extend the restriction
         attribute.  This attribute has been derived from IODEF
         [RFC5070] Section 5.1 and is explained in Section 5, Extending
         the Enumerated Values of Attributes.

      MsgType

         REQUIRED.  ENUM.  The type of GRC-Exchange message sent.  The
         five types of messages are described in Section 3.5 and can be
         noted as one of the five selections below.

         1.  Acknowledgement.  This message is sent to the initiating
             GRC-Exchange entity if a Request or Query has been denied
             or is pending.

         2.  Result.  This message provides the result of a Query.

         3.  Request.  The purpose of the Request is to request a report
             from an entity.

         4.  Report.  This message is used to provide a GRC XML report.

         5.  Query.  This message is used to request information either
             about a specific report or group of reports.  The actual
             query is specified in the GRC XML Schema and is outside the
             scope of this specification.

         6.  ext-value.  An escape value used to extend this attribute.
             This attribute has been derived from IODEF [RFC5070],
             Section 5.1 and is explained in Section 5, Extending the
             Enumerated Values of Attributes.

      ext-MsgType

         OPTIONAL.  STRING.  A means by which to extend the MsgType
         attribute.  This attribute has been derived from IODEF
         [RFC5070] Section 5.1 and is explained in Section 5, Extending

         the Enumerated Values of Attributes.

      MsgDestination

         REQUIRED.  ENUM.  The destination required at this level may
         either be the system accepting GRC report exchange requests or
         reports.  The Node element lists the address of the host
         receiving the GRC-Exchange message.

         1.  GRCSystem.  The address listed in the Node element of the
             GRCPolicy class is the system communicating via GRC-
             Exchange that will receive the message.

         2.  ext-value.  An escape value used to extend this attribute.
             This attribute has been derived from IODEF [RFC5070]
             Section 5.1 and is explained in Section 5, Extending the
             Enumerated Values of Attributes.

         MsgDestination attribute.  This attribute has been derived from
         IODEF [RFC5070] Section 5.1 and is explained in Section 5,
         Extending the Enumerated Values of Attributes.

4.2.  RequestStatus

   The RequestStatus class is an aggregate class in the GRC-Exchange
   class.

      restriction

         OPTIONAL.  ENUM.  This attribute indicates the disclosure
         guidelines to which the sender expects the recipient to adhere.
         This guideline provides no real security since it is the choice
         of the recipient of the document to honor it.  This attribute
         follows the same guidelines as "restriction" used in IODEF and
         is explained in the GRCPolicy Class description in Section 4.1.

      ext-restriction

         OPTIONAL.  STRING.  A means by which to extend the restriction
         attribute.  This attribute has been derived from IODEF
         [RFC5070] Section 5.1 and is explained in Section 5, Extending
         the Enumerated Values of Attributes.

      AuthorizationStatus

         REQUIRED.  ENUM.  The listed values are used to provide a
         response to the requesting entity of the ReportRequest or
         ReportQuery.

         1.  Approved.  The request was approved and will be provided.
             The approved message MAY be sent if there will be a delay
             in providing the report, otherwise, the Report or Result
             MAY be provided without sending a Acknowledgement message.

         2.  Denied.  The request has been denied.

         3.  Pending.  Awaiting approval; a timeout period has been
             reached, which resulted in this Pending status and
             Acknowledgement message being generated.

         4.  ext-value.  An escape value used to extend this attribute.
             This attribute has been derived from IODEF [RFC5070]
             Section 5.1 and is explained in Section 5, Extending the
             Enumerated Values of Attributes.

                      Figure 5: The GRCDocument Class

   The elements that constitute the GRCDocument class are as follows:

      ReportType

         One or many.  REQUIRED.  The values for the attribute "type"
         are meant to assist in determining if the included XML report
         or request is appropriate for the entity receiving the request
         or report message.  Multiple values may be selected for this
         element; however, where possible, it should be restricted to
         one value that most accurately describes the report type.

         type

            One. ENUM.

            1.  Filing.  This ReportType is used when a GRC report is
                included for expected filing purposes.  Examples may
                include the filing of a regulatory or business
                operations report to a regulatory body.

            2.  Service Level Agreement.  This option specifies the
                report type as a report on a service level agreement.
                This report may be sent from a service provide (SP) to a
                tenant or client or from a trust authority to a
                requesting entity.  An SLA report may be associated with
                any report format (XML) associated with an SLA
                agreement, including but not limited to an IT or
                security report.

            3.  Operational.  An operational report may include any
                standard operating reports used within or between
                businesses or enterprises.  This may be a routine
                business, IT operational, or other type of report.

            4.  Compliance.  A compliance report is specified when there
                is a specific compliance report format required (as
                specified by the schema used for the report).  This type
                may be used for internal or external compliance report
                exchanges.

            5.  Audit.  The Audit report type is distinguished from a
                compliance report as the report contents may vary
                depending on the report or report request in the
                exchange.  An audit report may take an approach of only
                providing the state of compliance or details of findings
                from an automated control review.

            6.  RiskAssessment.  A RiskAssessment report differs from
                the Compliance and Audit reports in that the report may
                prioritize risks as specified in the XML schema and may
                include GRC-XML risk ratings.  A RiskAssessment may be
                provided for any GRC area or on the GRC program as
                specified by the GRCDocument.

            7.  OfficialBusiness.  This option MUST be used if the GRC
                information is requested by or affiliated with any
                government or other official business request.  This
                could be used during an investigation for an eDiscovery,
                eWarrant, or other use case.

            8.  Other.  If this option is selected, a description of the
                request MUST be provided so that policy decisions can be
                made to proceed with the request or act upon the report.
                The information should be provided in the GRC-Exchange
                class meaning attribute.

            9.  ext-value.  An escape value used to extend this type.
                This value has been derived from IODEF [RFC5070],
                Section 5.1 and is explained in Section 5, Extending the
                Enumerated Values of Attributes.

         ext-type

            OPTIONAL.  One. STRING.  A means by which to extend the type
            attribute.  This attribute has been derived from IODEF
            [RFC5070] Section 5.1 and is explained in Section 5,
            Extending the Enumerated Values of Attributes.

      FromContact

         Zero or more.  Contact.  Provides contact information for the
         parties responsible for a report provided in the GRC Report
         Exchange as defined by the Contact class in Section 4.6.

      URL

         Zero or One. URL.  A reference to the XML schema included.  The
         URL data type is defined in Section 3.4.4.  The schemaLocation
         for IODEF is already included in the RID schema, so this is not
         necessary to include a URL for IODEF documents.

      XMLDocument

         One. ExtensionType.  The XMLDocument is a complete XML document
         defined by the ExtensionType class in Section 4.7.  This class
         follows the guidelines in [RFC5070] Section 5 where the data
         type is set to "xml" and meaning is set to "xml" to include an
         xml document.

      Signature

         Zero to many.  ExtensionType.  The Signature includes a
         complete XML document with the type specified by the
         ExtensionType class in Section 4.7.  This class follows the
         guidelines in [RFC5070] Section 5 where the data type is set to
         "xml" and meaning is set to "xml" to include an xml document.
         The usage of this element is similar to RID [RFC6545] and is
         used to encapsulate the detached signature based on a specific
         class within the XML document to verify the originator of the
         message.  If a detached signature is used, guidance for the
         encapsulated document MUST be provided as to which class should
         be used to create the signature.  Alternatively, if no guidance
         is provided, the digital signature MUST be an enveloped
         signature of the entire XML document that is encapsulated.
         This attribute has been derived from RID [RFC6545], Section
         5.1.1.

      The GRCDocument class has six attributes:

      Version

         OPTIONAL.  One. The Version attribute is the version number of
         the specified XML schema.  That schema must be an approved
         version of a schema registered with IANA for use with GRC-
         Exchange.  The IANA registry for managing schemas used with
         GRC-Exchange is specified in Section 13.  This attribute has

         been derived from RID [RFC6545], Section 5.1.1.

            ext-value.  An escape value used to extend this attribute.
            This attribute has been derived from IODEF [RFC5070],
            Section 5.1 and is explained in Section 5, Extending the
            Enumerated Values of Attributes.

      ext-Version

         OPTIONAL.  One. STRING.  The ext-Version attribute is the
         version number of the included XML schema.  This attribute is
         used if a schema other than an IANA registered schema that has
         been added to the enumerated list for Version is included.
         This attribute has been derived from RID [RFC6545], Section
         5.1.1.

      XMLSchemaID

         OPTIONAL.  One. URL.  The XMLSchemaID attribute is the
         identifier, the defined namespace [W3C.REC-xml-names-20091208],
         of the XML schema of the XML document included.  The
         XMLSchemaID and Version specify the format of the XMLDocument
         element.  The only permitted values, include any namespace
         listed in the IANA managed list of registered schemas for use
         with GRC-Exchange.  The IANA registry for managing schemas is
         specified in Section 13.  This attribute has been derived from
         RID [RFC6545], Section 5.1.1.

            ext-value.  An escape value used to extend this attribute.
            This attribute has been derived from IODEF [RFC5070],
            Section 5.1 and is explained in Section 5, Extending the
            Enumerated Values of Attributes.

      ext-XMLSchemaID

         OPTIONAL.  One. The ext-XMLSchemaID attribute is the identifier
         (defined namespace) of the XML schema of the XML document
         included.  The ext-XMLSchemaID and ext-Version specify the
         format of the XMLDocument element and are used if the included
         schema is not an IANA registered schema that has been added to
         the enumerated list for XMLSchemaID.  This attribute has been
         derived from RID [RFC6545], Section 5.1.1.

      restriction

         OPTIONAL.  ENUM.  This attribute indicates the disclosure
         guidelines to which the sender expects the recipient to adhere.
         This guideline provides no real security since it is the choice

         of the recipient of the document to honor it.  This attribute
         follows the same guidelines as "restriction" used in IODEF and
         is explained in the GRCPolicy Class description in Section 4.1.

      ext-restriction

         OPTIONAL.  STRING.  A means by which to extend the restriction
         attribute.  This attribute has been derived from IODEF
         [RFC5070] Section 5.1 and is explained in Section 5, Extending
         the Enumerated Values of Attributes.

4.4.  Reference Class

   The Reference class is a reference to the GRC Schema used for the
   exchange.  A reference consists of a name, a URL to this reference,
   and an optional description.

           +------------------+
           | Reference        |
           +------------------+
           |                  |<>----------[ ReferenceName ]
           |                  |<>--{0..*}--[ URL           ]
           |                  |<>--{0..*}--[ Description   ]
           +------------------+

                       Figure 6: The Reference Class

   The aggregate classes that constitute Reference:

      ReferenceName

         One. ML_STRING.  Name of the reference.

      URL

         Zero or many.  URL.  A URL associated with the reference.

      Description

         Zero or many.  ML_STRING.  A free-form text description of this
         reference.

4.5.  ReportID Class

   The ReportID class represents a report tracking number that is unique
   in the context of the reporting organization and identifies the
   activity characterized in a GRCDocument.  This identifier would serve
   as an index into the organizational reporting system.  The

   combination of the name attribute and the string in the element
   content MUST be a globally unique identifier describing the activity.
   Documents generated by a given organization MUST NOT reuse the same
   value unless they are referencing the same report instance.  The
   ReportID class is derived from IODEF [RFC5070], Section 3.3.

        +------------------------+
        | ReportID               |
        +------------------------+
        | STRING                 |
        |                        |
        | STRING name            |
        | STRING instance        |
        | ENUM restriction       |
        | STRING ext-restriction |
        +------------------------+

                       Figure 7: The ReportID Class

   The ReportID class has four attributes:

      name

         Required.  STRING.  An identifier describing the organization
         that created the report.  In order to have a globally unique
         organization name, the fully qualified domain name associated
         with the organization MUST be used.

      instance

         Optional.  STRING.  An identifier referencing a subset of the
         named report.

      restriction

         Optional.  ENUM.  This attribute follows the same guidelines as
         "restriction" explained in the GRCPolicy Class description in
         Section 4.1.

      ext-restriction

         OPTIONAL.  STRING.  A means by which to extend the restriction
         attribute.  This attribute has been derived from IODEF
         [RFC5070] Section 5.1 and is explained in Section 5, Extending
         the Enumerated Values of Attributes.

4.6.  Contact Class

   The Contact class describes contact information for organizations and
   personnel involved in the report exchange.  This class allows for the
   naming of the involved party, specifying contact information for
   them, and identifying their role in the XML Report.  The Contact
   class is derived from IODEF [RFC5070], Section 3.7.

   People and organizations are treated interchangeably as contacts; one
   can be associated with the other using the recursive definition of
   the class (the Contact class is aggregated into the Contact class).
   The 'type' attribute disambiguates the type of contact information
   being provided.

   The inheriting definition of Contact provides a way to relate
   information without requiring the explicit use of identifiers in the
   classes or duplication of data.  A complete point of contact is
   derived by a particular traversal from the root Contact class to the
   leaf Contact class.  As such, multiple points of contact might be
   specified in a single instance of a Contact class.  Each child
   Contact class logically inherits contact information from its
   ancestors.

     +------------------------+
     | Contact                |
     +------------------------+
     | ENUM role              |<>-{0..1}-[ ContactName       ]
     | STRING ext-role        |<>-{0..*}-[ Description       ]
     | ENUM type              |<>-{0..*}-[ RegistryHandle    ]
     | STRING ext-type        |<>-{0..1}-[ PostalAddress     ]
     | ENUM restriction       |<>-{0..*}-[ Email             ]
     | STRING ext-restriction |<>-{0..*}-[ Telephone         ]
     |                        |<>-{0..1}-[ Fax               ]
     |                        |<>-{0..1}-[ Timezone          ]
     |                        |<>-{0..*}-[ AdditionalContact ]
     |                        |<>-{0..*}-[ AdditionalData    ]
     +------------------------+

                        Figure 8: The Contact Class

   The aggregate classes that constitute the Contact class are:

      ContactName

         Zero or one.  ML_STRING.  The name of the contact.  The contact
         may either be an organization or a person.  The type attribute
         disambiguates the semantics.

Internet-Draft                grc-exchange                 November 2012


      Description

         Zero or many.  ML_STRING.  A free-form description of this
         contact.  In the case of a person, this is often the
         organizational title of the individual.

      RegistryHandle

         Zero or many.  A handle name into the registry of the contact.

      PostalAddress

         Zero or one.  The postal address of the contact.

      Email

         Zero or many.  The email address of the contact.

      Telephone

         Zero or many.  The telephone number of the contact.

      Fax

         Zero or one.  The facsimile telephone number of the contact.

      Timezone

         Zero or one.  TIMEZONE.  The timezone in which the contact
         resides formatted according to Section Section 3.4.6.

      AdditionalContact

         Zero or many.  A Contact instance contained within another
         Contact instance inherits the values of the parent(s).  This
         recursive definition can be used to group common data
         pertaining to multiple points of contact and is especially
         useful when listing multiple contacts at the same organization.

      AdditionalData

         Zero or many.  A mechanism by which to extend the data model.

   At least one of the aggregate classes MUST be present in an instance
   of the Contact class.  This is not enforced in the GRC-Exchange
   schema as there is no simple way to accomplish it.

   The Contact class has six attributes:

4.7.  ExtensionType Class

   The ExtensionType class serves as an extension mechanism for
   information not otherwise represented in the data model.  For
   relatively simple information, atomic data types (e.g., integers,
   strings) are provided with a mechanism to annotate their meaning.
   The class can to encapsulating entire XML documents conforming to an
   IANA registered Schema.  This class is also used to provide a
   consistent location for the inclusion of digital signatures.

   Unlike XML, which is self-describing, atomic data must be documented
   to convey its meaning.  This information is described in the
   'meaning' attribute.  Since these description are outside the scope
   of the specification, some additional coordination may be required to
   ensure that a recipient of a document using the ExtensionType classes
   can make sense of the custom extensions.

4.9.  Address Class

   The Address class represents a hardware (layer-2), network (layer-3),
   or application (layer-7) address.

   This class was derived from IODEF [RFC5070] and is fully included in
   this specification.  The original IODEF definition was derived from
   IDMEF [RFC4765].

   The Address class has four attributes:

      category

         Required.  ENUM.  The type of address represented.  The

      vlan-num

         Optional.  STRING.  The number of the Virtual LAN to which the
         address belongs.

4.10.  GRC-Exchange Name Spaces

   The GRC-Exchange schema declares a namespace of "grc-exchange-1.0"
   and registers it per [W3C.REC-xml-names-20091208].  Any XML instance
   incorporating GRC-Exchange MUST use the element GRC-Exchange in the
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:grc-exchange-1.0" namespace.  It can be
   referenced as follows:

<GRC-Exchange version="1.00" lang="en-US"
   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-Instance"
   xmlns:grc-exchange="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:grc-exchange-1.0"
   xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.iana.org/assignments/xml-registry/schema
   /grc-exchange-1.0.xsd">


5.  Extending the Enumerated Values of Attributes

   In order to support the evolving needs of XML Schema exchanges, some
   extensibility is built into the GRC Report Exchange protocol.  This
   section discusses how new attributes that have no current
   representation in the data model can be incorporated into GRC-
   Exchange.  These techniques are designed so that adding new data will



Moriarty, et al.          Expires May 10, 2013                 [Page 37]

Internet-Draft                grc-exchange                 November 2012


   not require a change to the schema.  With proven value, well-
   documented additions can be incorporated into future versions of the
   specification.  However, this approach also supports private
   additions relevant only to a closed consortium.

   The data model supports a means by which to add new enumerated values
   to an attribute, following the method used in IODEF [RFC5070] for the
   same purpose.  For each attribute that supports this extension
   technique, there is a corresponding attribute in the same element
   whose name is identical, less a prefix of "ext-".  This special
   attribute is referred to as the extension attribute, and the
   attribute being extended is referred to as an extensible attribute.
   For example, an extensible attribute named "foo" will have a
   corresponding extension attribute named "ext-foo".  An element may
   have many extensible, and therefore many extension, attributes.  In
   addition to a corresponding extension attribute, each extensible
   attribute has "ext-value" as one its possible values.  This
   particular value serves as an escape sequence and has no valid
   meaning.

   In order to add a new enumerated value to an extensible attribute,
   the value of this attribute MUST be set to "ext-value", and the new
   desired value MUST be set in the corresponding extension attribute.
   For example, an extended instance of the type attribute of the Impact
   class would look as follows:

       <Impact type="ext-value" ext-type="new-attack-type">

   A given extension attribute MUST NOT be set unless the corresponding
   extensible attribute has been set to "ext-value".


6.  GRC Report Exchange Messages

   The GRC-Exchange schema is used in combination with GRC XML documents
   to facilitate GRC Report Exchange communications.  Each message type
   varies slightly in format and purpose; hence, the requirements vary
   and are specified for each.

   Note: The implementation of GRC-Exchange may automate the ability to
   fill in the content required for each message type from the GRC
   management systems involved in the message exchange.

6.1.  Acknowledgement

   Description: This message is sent in response to a Request or a Query
   message to provide status as to the approval of a request.

Internet-Draft                grc-exchange                 November 2012


   The following information is required for Acknowledgement messages
   and is provided through:

   GRC-Exchange Information:

      GRCPolicy

         GRC-Exchange message type, ReportID, and destination policy
         information

      RequestStatus class:

         AuthorizationStatus of request

   Standards for encryption and digital signatures [RFC3275],
   [W3C.REC-xmldsig-core-20080610]:

      Digital signature of responding entity authenticity of GRC-
      Exchange Message, from the entity creating this message using an
      enveloped XML digital signature.

      XML encryption as required by policy, agreements, and standard
      data markers.

   A pending status is automatically generated after a 5-minute timeout
   without system predefined or administrator action taken to approve or
   deny the request.  If a request is left in a pending state for more
   than a configurable period of time (default of 5 minutes), a response
   is sent to the requestor with the enumeration value set to pending.
   If a request is denied, the response sets the enumeration value to
   denied.  If the request is approved, but the response will be
   delayed, a response MAY be sent with the enumerated value set to
   approved.  The approved message is not mandatory, however the pending
   and denied message types MUST be sent if the conditions are reached.

6.2.  Result

   Description: This message provides the result of an approved Query.
   The Query may be used when a query is made on a group of reports or a
   request is made for specific details within a report.  If a standard
   report is requested based on a specific XML schema, Request MUST be
   used.  The details of the Query will vary depending on the included
   GRC XML schema.  The XML schema may provide specific guidance on how
   queries are conducted as this specification is intended to provide a
   generalized structure for many types of GRC information exchanges.

   The following information is required for Result messages and will be

      GRC-Exchange Information:

         GRCPolicy

            GRC-Exchange message type, ReportID, and destination policy
            information

         GRCDocument

            The GRCDocument class specifies the specific GRC-Exchange
            XML schema that is required per the Query.  The Result will
            include the necessary information to appropriately respond
            to the request.

      GRC XML Information:

         GRC XML schema elements and attributes as appropriate for the
         Query.

      Standards for encryption and digital signatures [RFC3275]:

         Digital signature of sending entity for authenticity of Result
         message, from the entity creating this message using an
         enveloped XML digital signature.

         XML encryption as required by policy, agreements, and standard
         data markers.

   A Result message is sent back to the requesting entity of a Query.
   This will include the results of the query using the appropriate XML
   schema named in the request.  Details of what standard queries are
   automated in addition to the standard responses are to be detailed by
   the appropriate GRC communities (GRC-XML, LI-XML, etc.) in guidance
   documents associated with each of the relevant schemas.

6.3.  Request

   Description: The Request is used to request a report in a
   standardized format using the referenced XML schema in the
   GRCDocument class.  The report requested will be the most recent
   report to the date and time requested.

   The following information is required for Request messages and is
   provided through:

      GRC-Exchange Information:

         GRCPolicy

            GRC-Exchange message type, ReportID, and destination policy
            information

      GRC XML Information:

         GRC XML schema elements and attributes as appropriate for the
         Request.

      Standards for encryption and digital signatures [RFC3275]:

         Digital signature from initiating entity sending the GRC-
         Exchange message using a detached XML digital signature on the
         GRC-Exchange information.

         Digital signature of requesting entity for authenticity of the
         GRC-Exchange message, from the entity sending this message
         using an enveloped XML digital signature on the included GRC-
         XML document document.

         XML encryption as required by policy, agreements, and data
         markers.

   Security requirements include the ability to encrypt
   [W3C.REC-xmlenc-core-20021210] the contents of the ReportRequest
   message using the public key of the destination entity communicating
   via GCR-Exchange.  If no report is available for the exact date and
   time in the request, the most recent report details prior to the date
   requested will be provided.  If there is no report to provide per the
   specified date and time, the Acknowledgement message will be sent
   instead setting the AuthorizationStatus to denied and providing the
   appropriate reason for the deny.

6.4.  Report

   Description: This message is used to provide a report using a
   specified GRC XML schema.  This message does not require any actions
   to be taken, except to file the report on the receiving system or
   associated database.  This message may be in response to a Request or
   sent as a regularly scheduled report.

   The following information is required for Report messages and will be
   provided through:

      GRC-Exchange Information:

         GRCPolicy GRC-Exchange message type, ReportID, and destination
         policy information

      The following data is recommended if available and can be provided
      through:

      GRC XML Information:

         GRC XML schema elements and attributes as appropriate for the
         Request.

      Standards for encryption and digital signatures [RFC3275]:

         Digital signature from initiating entity, passed to all systems
         receiving the report using an enveloped XML digital signature.

         XML encryption as required by policy, agreements, and standard
         data markers.

   Security requirements include the ability to encrypt
   [W3C.REC-xmlenc-core-20021210] the contents of the Report message
   using the public key of the destination entity.  Senders of a Report
   message should note that the information may be used to correlate
   information for the purpose of trending, pattern detection, etc., and
   may be shared with other parties unless otherwise agreed upon with
   the receiving entity in an established contract or agreement.
   Therefore, sending parties of a Report message may obfuscate or
   remove sensitive information before sending a Report message.  A
   Report message may be sent either to file a report or in response to
   an ReportRequest, and data sensitivity must be considered in both
   cases.

6.5.  Query

   Description: The report Query message is used to request information
   from a trusted entity participating in GRC-Exchanges.  The request
   can include the ReportID number, if known, or detailed information
   about the report or group of reports applicable to the query.

   The following information must be used for a report Query message and
   is provided through:

      GRC-Exchange Information:

         GRCPolicy

            GRC-Exchange message type, ReportID, and destination policy
            information

      GRC XML information (optional):

         GRC XML schema elements and attributes as appropriate for the
         report Query.

      Standards for encryption and digital signatures [RFC3275]:

         Digital signature from the entity initiating the GRC-Exchange
         message, passed to all systems receiving the report Query using
         an enveloped XML digital signature.

         XML encryption as required by policy, agreements, and standard
         data markers.

   The proper response to the Query message is a Result message.
   Security requirements include the ability to encrypt
   [W3C.REC-xmlenc-core-20021210] the contents of the report Request
   message using the public key of the destination entity communicating
   via GCR-Exchange.  If no report is available for the exact date and
   time in the request, the most recent report details prior to the date
   requested will be provided.  If there is no report to provide per the
   specified date and time, the Acknowledgement message will be sent
   instead setting the AuthorizationStatus to denied and providing the
   appropriate reason for the deny.


7.  GRC-Exchange Communication Flows

   The following section outlines the communication flows for GRC-
   Exchange and also provides examples of messages.

7.1.  Report Communication Flow

   The diagram below outlines the communication flow for a GRC-Exchange
   Report message sent from one entity to another.  This communication
   flow is the simplest as no response is required.  The Report may be a
   regularly scheduled report filing.

             Figure 16: GRC-Exchange Report Communication Flow

   The Report message MAY be encrypted [W3C.REC-xmlenc-core-20021210]
   for the recipient of the report depending upon the markers included
   in the restriction class either in the GRC-Exchange schema or in the
   GRC XML schema used for the report.  When a report is received, the
   receiving entity must verify that the report has not already been
   filed.  The ReportID and other distinguishing information in the
   specific report type can be used to compare with existing database
   entries.  The Report message typically does not have a response, but
   the use of an Acknowledgement message is sometimes required to
   communicate status or error handling information.

7.1.1.  GRC-Exchange Report Example

   The example listed is of a Report based on ...

   In the following example, use of [W3C.REC-xmldsig-core-20080610] to
   generate digital signatures follows the guidance of XMLDsig 1.0
   [W3C.REC-xmldsig-core-20080610].  XMLDsig version 1.1
   [W3C.CR-xmldsig-core1-20110303] supports additional digest
   algorithms.  Reference [RFC4051] for URIs intended for use with XML
   digital signatures, encryption, and canonicalization.  SHA-1 SHOULD
   NOT be used, see [RFC6194] for further details.


   Example to be provided in an updated version of this document.


7.2.  Request Communication Flow

   The diagram below outlines the GRC-Exchange report request
   communication flow between participating entities.  The proper
   response to a report Request is a Report message.  If there is a
   problem with the request, such as a failure to validate the digital
   signature or decrypt the request, a Acknowledgement message is sent
   to the requestor.  The Acknowledgement message should provide the
   reason why the message could not be processed.

   If there is a problem with the Query message, such as a failure to
   validate the digital signature [RFC3275] or decrypt the request, an
   Acknowledgement message is sent to the requestor.  The
   Acknowledgement message should provide the reason why the message
   could not be processed.

   Example to be provided in an updated version of this document.


7.3.2.  Acknowledgement Message Example

   The example Acknowledgement message is in response to the Query
   message listed above.  The entity that received the request is
   responding with an answer to the Query.  The Result in this instance
   will be delayed for more than the 5-minute default time period, hence
   a Acknowledgement message is sent to notify of the approval status.

8.  Internationalization Issues

   Internationalization and localization is of specific concern to the
   GRC-Exchange, since information will often need to be exchanged
   across language barriers.  The GRC-Exchange supports this goal by
   depending on XML constructs, and through explicit design choices in
   the data model.

   GRC-Exchange documents are limited to the use of UTF-8 as it
   adequately provides the necessary support for internationalization.
   Additionally, each included document MUST specify the language in
   which their contents are encoded.  The language can be specified with
   the attribute "xml:lang" (per Section 2.12 of [W3C.REC-xml-20081126])
   in the top-level element (i.e., GRC-Exchange-Document@lang) and
   letting all other elements inherit that definition.  All GRC-Exchange
   classes with a free-form text definition (i.e., all those defined of
   type grc-exchange:MLStringType) can also specify a language different
   from the rest of the document.  The valid language codes for the
   "xml:lang" attribute are described in [RFC5646].

   The data model supports multiple translations of free-form text.  In
   the places where free-text is used for descriptive purposes, the
   given class always has a one-to-many cardinality to its parent (e.g.,
   Description class).  The intent is to allow the identical text to be
   encoded in different instances of the same class, but each being in a
   different language.  This approach allows a GRC-Exchange document
   author to send recipients speaking different languages an identical
   document.  The GRC-Exchange parser SHOULD extract the appropriate
   language relevant to the recipient.

   While the intent of the data model is to provide internationalization
   and localization, the intent is not to do so at the detriment of



Moriarty, et al.          Expires May 10, 2013                 [Page 47]

Internet-Draft                grc-exchange                 November 2012


   interoperability.  While the GRC-Exchange does support different
   languages, the data model also relies heavily on standardized
   enumerated attributes that can crudely approximate the contents of
   the document.  With this approach, an organization should be able to
   make some sense of an GRC-Exchange document it receives even if the
   text based data elements are written in a language unfamiliar to the
   consumer.

   The Node class identifies a host or network device.  This document
   re-uses the definition of Node from the IODEF specification
   [RFC5070], Section 3.16.  However, that document did not clearly
   specify whether a NodeName could be an Internationalized Domain Name
   (IDN).  GRC-Exchange systems MUST treat the NodeName class as a
   domain name slot [RFC5890].  GRC-Exchange systems SHOULD support IDNs
   in the NodeName class; if they do so, the UTF-8 representation of the
   domain name MUST be used, i.e., all of the domain name's labels MUST
   be U-labels expressed in UTF-8 or NR-LDH labels [RFC5890]; A-labels
   MUST NOT be used.  An application communicating via GRC-Exchange can
   convert between A-labels and U-labels by using the Punycode encoding
   [RFC3492] for A-labels as described in the protocol specification for
   Internationalized Domain Names in Applications [RFC5891].

10.  Requirements for GRC XML Schemas for GRC-Exchange

   GRC Report Exchange is a generalized version of the Real-time Inter-
   network Defense (RID) [RFC6545] protocol.  RID leverages certain
   aspects of the Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF)
   [RFC5070] schema to provide the necessary security features such as
   confidentiality and integrity required for the exchange of
   potentially sensitive information.  In generalizing RID into a schema
   and set of message exchange flows for GRC reports, the GRC XML
   schemas MUST include the following: classes, elements, and attributes
   with enumerated values to facilitate the automated security and
   confidentially concerns for GRC Report Exchange.  A GRC XML schema
   within this document may refer to any type of XML schema used for
   Governance, Risk, and Compliance information or reporting.  Examples



Moriarty, et al.          Expires May 10, 2013                 [Page 49]

Internet-Draft                grc-exchange                 November 2012


   include, but are not limited to GRC-XML, LI-XML, and security
   automation XML schemas.

      The restriction attribute, reused from IODEF [RFC5070] into GRC-
      Exchange, MUST be included in any individual class of a GRC XML
      schema that could require XML encryption
      [W3C.REC-xmlenc-core-20021210] just on the data contained in that
      class.  If encryption is only required at the full document level
      based on the sensitivity and sharing requirements, the restriction
      attribute in GRC-Exchange may be sufficient.


11.  Security Requirements

   The content in this section is derived from RID [RFC6545].

11.1.  XML Digital Signatures and Encryption

   GRC-Exchange leverages existing security standards and data markings
   in GRCPolicy to achieve the required levels of security for the
   exchange of GRC information.  The use of standards include TLS and
   the XML security features of encryption
   [W3C.REC-xmlenc-core-20021210] and digital signatures [RFC3275],
   [W3C.REC-xmldsig-core-20080610].  The standards provide clear methods
   to ensure that messages are secure, authenticated, and authorized,
   and that the messages meet policy and privacy guidelines and maintain
   integrity.

   As specified in the relevant sections of this document, the XML
   digital signature [RFC3275] and XML encryption
   [W3C.REC-xmlenc-core-20021210] are used in the following cases:

   XML Digital Signature

   o  For all message types, the full GRC-Exchange document MUST be
      signed using an enveloped signature by the sending peer to provide
      authentication and integrity to the receiving GRC-Exchange system.
      The signature is placed in an instance of the Signature element.

   o  XML Signature Best Practices
      [W3C.WD-xmldsig-bestpractices-20110809] guidance SHOULD be
      followed to prevent or mitigate security risks.  Examples include
      the recommendation to authenticate a signature prior to processing
      (executing potentially dangerous operations) and limiting the use
      of URIs since they may enable cross-site scripting attacks or
      access to local information.

Internet-Draft                grc-exchange                 November 2012


   o  XML Path Language (XPath) 2.0 [W3C.REC-xpath20-20101214] MUST be
      followed to specify the portion of the XML document to be signed.
      XPath is used to specify a location within an XML document.  Best
      practice recommendations for using XPath
      [W3C.WD-xmldsig-bestpractices-20110809] SHOULD be referenced to
      reduce the risk of denial of service attacks.  The use of XSLT
      transforms MUST be restricted according to security guidance in
      [W3C.WD-xmldsig-bestpractices-20110809].

   XML Encryption

   o  The document included in GRC-Exchange messages MAY be encrypted to
      provide an extra layer of security between peers so that the
      message is not only encrypted for transport.  This behavior would
      be agreed upon between peers or a consortium, or determined on a
      per-message basis, depending on security requirements.  It should
      be noted that there are cases for transport where the GRCPolicy
      class needs to be presented in clear text, as detailed in the
      transport document [RFC6546].

   o  A Request, or any other message type that may be relayed through
      GRC-Exchange systems before reaching the intended destination as a
      result of trust relationships, MAY be encrypted specifically for
      the intended recipient.  This may be necessary if the GRC-Exchange
      network is being used for message transfer, the intermediate
      parties do not need to have knowledge of the request contents, and
      a direct communication path does not exist.  In that case, the
      GRCPolicy class is used by intermediate parties and as such,
      GRCPolicy is maintained in clear text.

   o  A message may be encrypted using the key of the request
      originator, while leaving the GRC-Exchange contents in clear text.
      In that case, the intermediate parties can view the GRCPolicy
      information and know a response has been provided without seeing
      the contents of the response.  If the use of encryption were
      limited to sections of the message, the History class information
      would be encrypted.  Otherwise, it is RECOMMENDED to encrypt the
      entire included schema plus GRC-Exchange document and use an
      enveloped signature, for the originator of the request.  The
      existence of the Result message for an incident would tell any
      intermediate parties used in the path of the incident
      investigation that the incident handling has been completed.

   o  The restriction attribute sets expectations for the privacy of an
      incident and is defined in Section 4.1.  Following the guidance
      for XML encryption in the Security Requirements Section, the

      classes to define restrictions and encryption requirements for the

      exchange of GRC information.  The restriction options enable
      encryption capabilities for the complete exchange of an XML
      document (including any extensions), within specific classes of a
      schema that embeds the restriction attribute where more limited
      restrictions are desired.  The restriction attribute is contained
      in each of the GRC-Exchange classes and MUST be used in accordance
      with confidentiality expectations for either sections of the
      included XML document or the complete included XML document.
      Consortiums and organizations should consider this guidance when
      creating exchange policies.

   o  Expectations based on restriction setting:

      *  If restriction is set to "private", the class or document MUST
         be encrypted for the recipient using XML encryption and the
         public key of the recipient.  See Section 11.2 for a discussion
         on public key infrastructure (PKI) and other security
         requirements.

      *  If restriction is set to "need-to-know", the class or document
         MUST be encrypted to ensure only those with need-to-know access
         can decrypt the data.  The document can either be encrypted for
         each individual for which access is intended or a single group
         key may be used.  The method used SHOULD adhere to any
         certificate policy and practices agreements between entities
         for the use of GRC-Exchange.  A group key in this instance
         refers to a single key (symmetric) that is used to encrypt the
         block of data.  The users with need-to-know access privileges
         may be given access to the shared key via a secure distribution
         method, for example, providing access to the symmetric key
         encrypted with each of users public keys.

      *  If restriction is set to "public", the class or document MUST
         be sent in clear text.  This setting can be critical if certain
         sections of a document or an entire document are to be shared
         without restrictions.  This provides flexibility within an
         exchange to share out certain information freely where
         appropriate.

      *  If restriction is set to "default", The information can be
         shared according to an information disclosure policy pre-
         arranged by the communicating parties.

   o  Expectations based on placement of the restriction setting:

      *  If restriction is set within one of the GRC-Exchange classes,
         the restriction applies to the entire included XML document.

      *  If restriction is set within individual classes of the included
         XML document, the restriction applies to the specific class and
         the children of that class.

   The formation of policies is a very important aspect of using a
   messaging system like GRC-Exchange to exchange potentially sensitive
   information.  Many considerations should be involved for peering
   parties, and some guidelines to protect the data, systems, and
   transport are covered in this section.  Policies established should
   provide guidelines for communication methods, security, and fall-back
   procedures.  See Sections 11.3 and Section 11.4 for additional
   information on consortiums and PKI considerations.

   The security considerations for the storage and exchange of
   information in GRC-Exchange messaging may include adherence to local,
   regional, or national regulations in addition to the obligations to
   protect information.  GRC-Exchange Policy is a necessary tool for
   listing the requirements of messages to provide a method to
   categorize data elements for proper handling.  Controls are also
   provided for the sending entity to protect messages from third
   parties through XML encryption.

   GRC-Exchange provides a method to exchange GRC request and Report
   messages between entities.  Administrators have the ability to base
   decisions on the available resources and other factors of their
   enterprise and maintain control of GRC exchanges.  Thus, GRC-Exchange
   provides the ability for participating networks to manage their own
   security controls, leveraging the information listed in GRCPolicy.

   GRC-Exchange is used to transfer or exchange XML documents in an IANA
   registered format.  Implementations SHOULD NOT download schemas at
   runtime due to the security implications, and included documents MUST
   NOT be required to provide a resolvable location of their schema.

11.2.  Public Key Infrastructure

   It is RECOMMENDED that GRC-Exchange, the XML security functions, and
   transport protocols properly integrate with a PKI managed by the
   consortium, federate PKIs within a consortium, or use a PKI managed
   by a trusted third party.  Entities MAY use shared keys as an
   alternate solution, although this may limit the ability to validate
   certificates and could introduce risk.  For the Internet, a few of
   examples of existing efforts that could be leveraged to provide the
   supporting PKI include the Regional Internet Registry's (RIR's) PKI
   hierarchy, vendor issued certificates, or approved issuers of
   Extended Validation (EV) Certificates.  Security and privacy
   considerations related to consortiums are discussed in Sections 11.3
   and Section 11.4.



Moriarty, et al.          Expires May 10, 2013                 [Page 53]

Internet-Draft                grc-exchange                 November 2012


   The use of PKI between entities or by a consortium SHOULD adhere to
   any applicable certificate policy and practices agreements for the
   use of GRC-Exchange.  [RFC3647] specifies a commonly used format for
   certificate policy (CP) and certification practices statements (CPS).
   Systems with predefined relationships for GRC-Exchange include those
   who peer directly or through a consortium with agreed-upon
   appropriate use agreements.  The agreements to trust other entities
   may be based on assurance levels that could be determined by a
   comparison of the CP, CPS, and/or GRC-Exchange operating procedures.
   The initial comparison of policies and ability to audit controls
   provides a baseline assurance level for entities to form and maintain
   trust relationships.  Trust relationships may also be defined through
   a bridged or hierarchical PKI in which both peers belong.  If shared
   keys or keys issued from a common CA are used, the verification of
   controls to determine the assurance level to trust other entities may
   be limited to the GRC-Exchange policies and operating procedures.

   XML security functions utilized in GRC-Exchange require a trust
   center such as a PKI for the distribution of credentials to provide
   the necessary level of security for this protocol.  Layered transport
   protocols also utilize encryption and rely on a trust center.  Public
   key certificate pairs issued by a trusted Certification Authority
   (CA) MAY be used to provide the necessary level of authentication and
   encryption for the GRC-Exchange protocol.  The CA used for GRC-
   Exchange messaging must be trusted by all involved parties and may
   take advantage of similar efforts, such as the Internet2 federated
   PKI or the ARIN/RIR effort to provide a PKI to service providers.
   The PKI used for authentication also provides the necessary
   certificates needed for encryption used for the GRC-Exchange
   transport protocol [RFC6546].

11.2.1.  Authentication

   Hosts receiving a GRC-Exchange message MUST be able to verify that
   the sender of the request is valid and trusted.  Using digital
   signatures on a hash of the GRC-Exchange message with an X.509
   version 3 certificate issued by a trusted party MUST be used to
   authenticate the request.  The X.509 version 3 specifications as well
   as the digital signature specifications and path validation standards
   set forth in [RFC5280] MUST be followed in order to interoperate with
   a PKI designed for similar purposes.  Full path validation verifies
   the chaining relationship to a trusted root and also performs a
   certificate revocation check.  The use of digital signatures in GRC-
   Exchange XML messages MUST follow the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
   recommendations for signature syntax and processing when either the
   XML encryption [W3C.REC-xmlenc-core-20021210] or digital signature
   [W3C.REC-xmldsig-core-20080610], [RFC3275] is used within a document.




Moriarty, et al.          Expires May 10, 2013                 [Page 54]

Internet-Draft                grc-exchange                 November 2012


   It might be helpful to define an extension to the authentication
   scheme that uses attribute certificates [RFC5755] in such a way that
   an application could automatically determine whether human
   intervention is needed to authorize a request; however, the
   specification of such an extension is out of scope for this document.

   The use of pre-shared keys may be considered for authentication at
   the transport layer.  If this option is selected, the specifications
   set forth in "Pre-Shared Key Ciphersuites for Transport Layer
   Security (TLS)" [RFC4279] MUST be followed.  Transport specifications
   are detailed in a separate document [RFC6546].

11.2.2.  Multi-Hop Request Authentication

   The use of multi-hop authentication in a Request is used when a
   Request is sent to multiple entities in an iterative manner.  Multi-
   hop authentication is REQUIRED in Requests that involve multiple
   entities where Requests are forwarded iteratively through peers.
   Bilateral trust relationships MAY be used between peers, then Multi-
   hop authentication MUST be used for cases where the originator of a
   message is authenticated several hops into the message flow.

   For practical reasons, entities may want to prioritize incident
   handling events based upon the immediate peer for a Request, the
   originator of a request, and other relevant information provided in
   metadata.  In order to provide a higher assurance level of the
   authenticity of a Request, the originating GRC-Exchange system is
   included in the Request along with contact information and the
   information of all GRC-Exchange systems in the path the Request has
   taken.  This information is provided through the GRC-Exchange From-
   Contact class nesting the list of systems and contacts involved in a
   request.

   To provide multi-hop authentication, the originating GRC-Exchange
   system MUST include a digital signature in the Request sent to all
   systems in the upstream path.  The signature MUST be passed to all
   parties that receive a Request, and each party MUST be able to
   perform full path validation on the digital signature [RFC5280].  In
   order to accommodate that requirement, the signed data MUST remain
   unchanged as a request is passed along between providers and may be
   restricted to one element for which the signature is applied.  A
   second benefit to this requirement is that the integrity of the
   filter used is ensured as it is passed to subsequent entities in the
   upstream trace of the incident.  The trusted PKI also provides the
   keys used to digitally sign the selected data element for a Request
   to meet the requirement of authenticating the original request.  Any
   host in the path of the trace should be able to verify the digital
   signature using the trusted PKI.



Moriarty, et al.          Expires May 10, 2013                 [Page 55]

Internet-Draft                grc-exchange                 November 2012


   In the case in which an enterprise using GRC-Exchange sends a Request
   to its provider, the signature from the enterprise MUST be included
   in the initial request.  The provider may generate a new request to
   send upstream to members of the provider's consortium to continue the
   request.  If the original request is sent, the originating provider,
   acting on behalf of the enterprise network with a request, MUST also
   digitally sign, with an enveloped signature, the full included XML
   document to assure the authenticity of the Request.  A provider that
   offers GRC-Exchange as a service may be using its own PKI to secure
   GRC-Exchange communications between its GRC-Exchange system and the
   attached enterprise networks.  Providers participating in the trace
   MUST be able to determine the authenticity of GRC-Exchange requests.

11.3.  Consortiums and Public Key Infrastructures

   Consortiums are an ideal way to establish a communication web of
   trust for GRC-Exchange messaging.  It should be noted that direct
   relationships may be ideal for some communications, such as those
   between a provider of incident information and a subscriber of the
   incident reports.  The consortium could provide centralized
   resources, such as a PKI, and established guidelines and control
   requirements for use of GRC-Exchange.  The consortium may assist in
   establishing trust relationships between the participating providers
   to achieve the necessary level of cooperation and experience-sharing
   among the consortium entities.  This may be established through PKI
   certificate policy [RFC3647] reviews to determine the appropriate
   trust levels between organizations or entities.  The consortium may
   also be used for other purposes to better facilitate communication
   among providers in a common area (Internet, region, government,
   education, private networks, etc.).

   Using a PKI to distribute certificates used by GRC-Exchange systems
   provides an already established method to link trust relationships
   between consortiums that peer with SPs belonging to a separate
   consortium.  In other words, consortiums could peer with other
   consortiums to enable communication of GRC-Exchange messages between
   the participating providers.  The PKI along with Memorandums of
   Agreement could be used to link border directories to share public
   key information in a bridge, a hierarchy, or a single cross-
   certification relationship.

   Consortiums also need to establish guidelines for each participating
   provider to adhere.  The RECOMMENDED guidelines include:

   o  Physical and logical practices to protect GRC-Exchange systems;

   o  Network and application layer protection for GRC-Exchange systems
      and communications;



Moriarty, et al.          Expires May 10, 2013                 [Page 56]

Internet-Draft                grc-exchange                 November 2012


   o  Proper use guidelines for GRC-Exchange systems, messages, and
      requests; and

   o  A PKI, certificate policy, and certification practices statement
      to provide authentication, integrity, and privacy.

   The functions described for a consortium's role parallel that of a
   PKI federation.  The PKI federations that currently exist are
   responsible for establishing security guidelines and PKI trust
   models.  The trust models are used to support applications to share
   information using trusted methods and protocols.

   A PKI can also provide the same level of security for communication
   between an end entity (enterprise, educational, or government
   customer network) and the provider.

11.4.  Privacy Concerns and System Use Guidelines

   Information sharing typically raises many concerns especially when
   privacy related information may be exchanged.  The GRCPolicy class is
   used to automate the enforcement of the privacy concerns listed
   within this document.  The privacy and system use concerns for the
   system communicating GRC-Exchange messages and other integrated
   components include the following:

   Service Provider Concerns:

   o  Privacy information contained in Human Resources, legal,
      compliance and other reports.

   Customer Attached Networks Participating in GRC-Exchange with
   Provider:

   o  Customer networks may include an enterprise, educational,
      government, or other attached networks to a provider participating
      in GRC-Exchange.  Customers should review data handling policies
      to understand how data will be protected by a service provider.
      This information will enable customers to decide what types of
      data at what sensitivity level can be shared with service
      providers.  This information could be used at the application
      layer to establish sharing profiles for entities and groups, see
      Section 11.5.

   o  Customers should request information on the security and privacy
      considerations in place by their provider and the consortium of
      which the provider is a member.  Customers should understand if
      their data were to be forwarded, how might it be sanitized and how
      will it be protected.  Customers should also understand if



Moriarty, et al.          Expires May 10, 2013                 [Page 57]

Internet-Draft                grc-exchange                 November 2012


      limitations can be placed on how any data they share with their
      provider will be used in advance of sharing that data.

   o  Customers should be aware that their data can and will be sent to
      other providers in order to complete a request unless an agreement
      stating otherwise is made in the service level agreements between
      the customer and provider.  Customers considering privacy options
      may limit the use of this feature if they do not want the data
      forwarded.

   Parties Involved in Exchanges:

   o  Privacy of information such as the source and destination used for
      communication purposes over the monitored or GRC-Exchange
      connected network(s).

   o  Protection of data from being viewed by intermediate parties in
      the path of an Request request should be considered.

   o  Privacy of information exchanged in reports.

   Consortium Considerations:

   o  System use restrictions for information sharing within the local
      region's definitions of appropriate traffic.  When participating
      in a consortium, appropriate use guidelines should be agreed upon
      and entered into contracts.

   o  System use prohibiting the consortium's participating providers
      from inappropriately requesting information unlawfully within the
      jurisdiction or region.

   Inter-Consortium Considerations:

   o  System use between peering consortiums should consider any
      government communication regulations that apply between those two
      regions, such as encryption export and import restrictions.

   o  System use between consortiums SHOULD NOT request information and
      actions beyond the scope intended and permitted by law or inter-
      consortium agreements.

   o  System use between consortiums should consider national boundary
      issues and request limits in their appropriate system use
      agreements.  Appropriate use should include restrictions to
      prevent the use of the protocol to limit or restrict traffic that
      is otherwise permitted within the country in which the peering
      consortium resides.

   The security and privacy considerations listed above are for the
   consortiums, providers, and enterprises to agree upon.  The agreed-
   upon policies may be facilitated through use of the GRCPolicy class
   and application layer options.  Some privacy considerations are
   addressed through the GRC-Exchange guidelines for encryption and
   digital signatures as described in Section 11.1.

   GRC-Exchange messaging privacy concerns should be elaborated on
   here...

   Information shared through through GRC-Exchange could be sensitive.
   Such data in GRC-Exchange messages can be protected through the use
   of encryption [W3C.REC-xmlenc-core-20021210] enveloping the XML and
   GRC-Exchange document, using the public encryption key of the
   originating entity.

   The decision is left to the system users and consortiums to determine
   appropriate data to be shared given that the goal of the
   specification is to provide the appropriate technical options to
   remain compliant.  Local, state, or national laws may dictate the
   appropriate reporting requirements for specific exchange types.

   Privacy becomes an issue whenever sensitive data traverses a network.

   In the case of a Request or Report, where the originating provider is
   aware of the entity that will receive the request for processing, the
   free-form text areas of the document could be encrypted
   [W3C.REC-xmlenc-core-20021210] using the public key of the
   destination entity to ensure that no other entity in the path can
   read the contents.  The encryption is accomplished through the W3C
   [W3C.REC-xmlenc-core-20021210] specification for encrypting an
   element.

   GRC Report Exchanges must be legitimate incidents and not used for
   purposes such as sabotage or censorship.  An example of such abuse of
   the system includes a report containing information about a
   competitor's compliance that may have been falsified to hurt their
   business.

   Intra-consortium GRC-Exchange communications raise additional issues,
   especially when the peering consortiums reside in different regions
   or nations.

   The GRC Report Exchange messages may be a valid use of the system
   within the confines of that country's network border; however, it may
   not be permitted to continue across network boundaries where such
   content is permitted under law.  A continued Request, Query, or
   Report into a second country may break the laws and regulations of



Moriarty, et al.          Expires May 10, 2013                 [Page 59]

Internet-Draft                grc-exchange                 November 2012


   that nation.  Any such messages MUST cease at the country's border.

   The privacy concerns listed in this section address issues among the
   trusted parties involved in a trace within an provider, a GRC-
   Exchange consortium, and peering GRC-Exchange consortiums.  Data used
   for GRC-Exchange communications must also be protected from parties
   that are not trusted.  This protection is provided through the
   authentication and encryption of documents as they traverse the path
   of trusted servers and the local security controls in place for the
   GRC Report Exchange systems.  Each GRC-Exchange system MUST perform a
   bi-directional authentication when sending a GRC-Exchange message and
   use the public encryption key of the upstream or downstream peer to
   send a message or document over the network.  This means that the
   document is decrypted and re-encrypted at each GRC-Exchange system
   via TLS over a transport protocol such as [RFC6546].  The GRC-
   Exchange messages may be decrypted at each GRC-Exchange system in
   order to properly process the request or relay the information.
   Today's processing power is more than sufficient to handle the
   minimal burden of encrypting and decrypting relatively small typical
   GRC-Exchange messages.

11.5.  Sharing Profiles and Policies

   The application layer can be used to establish workflows and rulesets
   specific to sharing profiles for entities or consortiums.  The
   profiles can leverage sharing agreements to restrict data types or
   classifications of data that are shared.  The level of information or
   classification of data shared with any entity may be based on
   protection levels offered by the receiving entity and periodic
   validation of those controls.  The profile may also indicate how far
   information can be shared according to the entity and data type.  The
   profile can also support if requests to share data from an entity
   must go directly to that entity.

   In some cases, pre-defined sharing profiles will be possible.  These
   include any use case where an agreement is in place in advance of
   sharing.  Examples may be between clients and providers, entities
   such as partners, or consortiums.  There may be other cases when
   sharing profiles may not be established in advance.  An organization
   may want to establish sharing profiles specific to possible user
   groups to prepare for possible incident scenarios.  The user groups
   could include business partners, industry peers, service providers,
   experts not part of a service provider, law enforcement, or
   regulatory repotting bodies.

   Workflows to approve transactions may be specific to sharing profiles
   and data types.  Application developers should include capabilities
   to enable these decision points for users of the system.



Moriarty, et al.          Expires May 10, 2013                 [Page 60]

Internet-Draft                grc-exchange                 November 2012


   Any expectations between entities to preserve the weight and
   admissibility of evidence should be handled at the policy and
   agreement level.  A sharing profile may include notes or an indicator
   for approvers in workflows to reflect if such agreements exist.


12.  Security Considerations

   GRC Report Exchange has many security requirements and considerations
   built into the design of the protocol, several of which are described
   in the Security Requirements section.  For a complete view of
   security, considerations include the availability, confidentiality,
   and integrity concerns for the transport, storage, and exchange of
   information.

   Authenticated encrypted tunnels between systems accepting GRC-
   Exchange communications are used to provide confidentiality,
   integrity, authenticity, and privacy for the data at the transport
   layer.  Encryption and digital signatures are also used at the GRC
   XML document level through GRC-Exchange options to provide
   confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, privacy and traceability of
   the document contents.  Trust relationships may be through direct
   peers or consortiums using established trust relationships of public
   key infrastructure (PKI) via cross-certifications.  Trust levels can
   be established in cross-certification processes where entities
   compare PKI policies that include the specific management and
   handling of an entity's PKI and certificates issued under that
   policy.  [RFC3647] defines an Internet X.509 Public Key
   Infrastructure Certificate Policy and Certification Practices
   Framework that may be used in the comparison of policies to establish
   trust levels and agreements between entities, an entity and a
   consortium, and consortia.  The agreements SHOULD consider key
   management practices including the ability to perform path validation
   on certificates [RFC5280], key distribution techniques [RFC2585],
   Certificate Authority and Registration Authority management
   practices.

   The agreements between entities SHOULD also include a common
   understanding of the usage of GRC-Exchange security, policy, and
   privacy options discussed in this section.  The formality,
   requirements, and complexity of the agreements for the certificate
   policy, practices, and the use of GRC-Exchange options SHOULD be
   decided by the entities or consortiums creating those agreements.

      via GRC-Exchange consists of:

         Schema Name: A short string that represents the schema
         referenced.  This value is for reference only in the table.
         The version of the schema MUST be included in this string to
         allow for multiple versions of the same specification to be in
         the registry.

         Version: The version of the registered XML schema.  The version
         is a string that SHOULD be formatted as numbers separated by a
         '.' (period) character.

         Namespace: The namespace of the referenced XML schema.  This is
         represented in the GRC-Exchange GRCDocument class in the
         XMLSchemaID attribute as an enumerated value is represented by
         a URN or URI.

         Specification URI: A URI [RFC3986] from which the registered
         specification can be obtained.  The specification MUST be
         publicly available from this URI.

   Incident Lightweight Exchange) working group or its successor if any
   such WG exists (e.g., via email to the working group's mailing list).
   The Designated Expert is expected to retrieve the XML schema
   specification from the provided URI in order to check the public
   availability of the specification and verify the correctness of the
   URI.  An important responsibility of the Designated Expert is to
   ensure that the XML schema is appropriate for use in GRC-Exchange.

   Request for the specified registry to be created and managed by IANA:

      Name of the registry:"GRC-Exchange Enumeration List"

      The registry is intended to enable enumeration value additions to
      attributes in the grc-exchange XML schema.

15.  Summary

   Governance, Risk, and Compliance reports may contain some of the most
   sensitive information for a business.  Reports may contain the
   prioritized risks for the effective management of Business
   Operations, IT, Security, Compliance, and Legal departments of an
   enterprise.  There may be a regulatory or legal requirement to share
   information or formatted reports with a regulatory body or other
   entities in a legal review.  Outsourcing of computer infrastructure
   has necessitated the need for service providers to share reports with
   tenants or clients to ensure SLAs and agreements on security
   requirements are met.  Each of these use cases require a secure
   method to exchange reports.  GRC Report Exchange provides a
   standardized method to exchange reports while considering the
   security, privacy and policy requirements without relying on the
   transport layer for security.  Security is provided at the document
   level to provide methods to share a report where policy requirements
   can be implemented by mapping to technical options and data markers
   in the GRC-Exchange protocol.
