                      WSON Optical Interface Class
                draft-martinelli-wson-interface-class-02

Abstract

   Current work on wavelength switched optical network includes several
   considerations regarding the interface signal compatibility.  In
   particular ingress and egress optical interfaces will require a check
   on several optical parameters to assess if the signal generated by
   the ingress interface can be compatible with the receiving interface.
   Current solution available encode all parameters in WSON protocol
   extensions while in this draft will propose an alternative method to
   keep into account the signal compatibility issue at protocol level.

Internet-Draft        WSON Optical Interface Class            March 2012


1.  Introduction

   The current work on Wavelength Switched Optical Network (WSON) define
   the need of assessing the signal compatibility during the routing and
   wavelength assignment (RWA) process.  In details, the [RFC6163]
   reports the ingress and egress interfaces and the regeneration points
   as places where the optical signal compatibility must be assured.
   Regarding how to evaluate, there are a list of parameters identified
   according to ITU specification [ITU-G.698.1] and [ITU-G.698.2].  In
   particular the following set of parameters has been chosen: signal
   bit rate, modulation format, forward error correction.

   At the current state of art new high bit rates (40G/100G/flexgrid)
   and new modulation formats (e.g.  QPSK flavors) are already deployed
   in field.  Some of them are under standardization at ITU but it is
   not clear if and when there will be a dominating technology.  With
   the current realistic scenario, DWDM optical networks will have to
   manage different bit-rates as well as different modulation formats
   over the same link since different signal characteristics will
   coexist at the same time.

   To a further extent, WSON Control Plane needs consider the case with
   optical impairments awareness as detailed in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-wson-impairments].  In such a case, control plane
   will require some additional interface parameters to assess the
   optical feasibility path and, as a consequence, further WSON
   protocols extensions.

   Scope of this draft is to propose an Optical Interface Class
   identifier as a solution for the WSON signal compatibility problem.
   To some extend the idea is have protocol extensions independent from
   optical technology evolution by keeping the semantic of optical
   characteristics separated from protocol scope.  The final goal is not
   an encoding saving but rather a general abstract representation of
   some physical characteristics.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Existing WSON Signal Compatibility protocol extension

   Within the current WSON activity the signal compatibility encoding is
   defined within the [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rwa-wson-encode].

Internet-Draft        WSON Optical Interface Class            March 2012


   In details, the following set of parameters is considered:

   o  Modulation Format.  Only NRZ currently defined.

   o  FEC, according to G.709 and G.975.

   o  Bit Rate.

   This list of parameters is defined by ITU and might be subject to
   change for two reasons: new values for existing parameters, new
   parameters required by new technology or control plane evolution.

   At the current status, the above encoding is going to be used within
   several WSON specific protocol extensions.

   o  OSPF [I-D.ietf-ccamp-wson-signal-compatibility-ospf] since the
      path computation function need to consider optical interface
      parameters as a constrain during the RWA process.

   o  RSVP [I-D.ietf-ccamp-wson-signaling] since during the signaling
      phase there is the need to know optical ingress and egress
      interface properties (and eventually interfaces at regeneration
      point).

   o  In addition in case of PCE control plane solutions, PCEP extension
      needs similar parameters as envisaged here
      [I-D.lee-pce-wson-rwa-ext].

   In case of any update from ITU standards regarding optical signals
   and interfaces all the above drafts making use of the same
   information needs an update.


3.  Optical Interface Class

3.1.  Concept

   The Optical Interface Class is a unique number that identify all
   information related to optical characteristic's of a physical
   interface.  The class may include other optical parameters releated
   to other interface properties.  A class MUST always include signal
   compatibility information.

   The content of each class is out of the scope of this draft and can
   be defined by other entities (e.g.  ITU, optical equipment vendors,
   etc.).

   Since event current implementation of physical interfaces may support

Internet-Draft        WSON Optical Interface Class            March 2012


   different optical characteristics, a single interface may support
   multiple interface classes.  Which optical interface class is used
   among all the one available for each interfaces is out of the scope
   of this draft but likely is an output of the RWA process.

3.2.  Procedures

   In term of RWA process one operation required is to assess the
   optical compatibility (LSP endpoint interfaces or regeneration
   intermediate endpoints).  This is done by checking if the two optical
   endpoint have the same Optical Interface Class value.  Note that, if
   a lightpath implementing an LSP needs regeneration, the complete LSP
   may have some additional intermediate optical enpoints where
   regenerations happens.

   The procedure of signal compatibility assessment become just a
   numbers comparison: if two Optical Interface Class are equals the
   signal compatibility constrain is satisfied.  GMPLS protocols don't
   have to implement any logic or optical knowledge related to signal
   compatibility.

   The procedure is easily generalized in case more than one class is
   available for each interface since it's sufficient to find two
   matching values between each optical segment of a WSON LSP.

                                 Figure 1

   As an example Figure 1 shows a case where the RWA process end up in a
   path that need a wavelength conversion (I, N1, N2, REG, N3, E).
   Optical interfaces are reported as cl1, cl2 and cl3.  Each optical
   interface involved in the path at nodes I, REG, E must satisfy the
   Optical Interface Class constrain.  The LSP is then composed by two
   optical segment: S1 using optical interface class cl1 and S2 using
   optical interface class cl3.

Internet-Draft        WSON Optical Interface Class            March 2012


   By using the Optical Interface Class concept every protocol
   extensions supporting WSON does not need to care about DWDM signal
   details and does not need to consider technology specific evolution.
   If a new values are standardized (e.g. new modulation formats become
   standard) or new parameters are required, wson protocols don't need
   any extensions.  In addition, in case PCE is used within a WSON
   control plane, this allows all optical parameters to be fully known
   only by the PCE and does not require the other element any knowledge
   of them.

3.3.  Encoding

   The following Optical Interface Class must be be used in proper TLVs
   for different WSON protocol extensions.

   In case an optical interface or a regeneration point will support
   multiple optical capabilities, a list of Interface Classes can be
   used.  Note that the concept of list is already defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rwa-wson-encode].

      0: reserved

      1: [ITU-G.698.1] application code.

      2: [ITU-G.698.2] application code.

   In case of ITU Application Code, there should be a mapping between
   string defining the application code and the 64 bits number
   implementing the optical interface class.  This mapping is out of the
   scope of this document.

   However it is worthwhile to have a rough estimation if the 64 bits
   are enough for matching the currently defined ITU application code
   and with this purpose we provide the current analisys.  The
   application code consist of the following 8 elements: DScW-ytz(v).  D
   is fixed, S has two values (1 bit), c has currently 4 values (for
   reference [RFC6205] has 4 bit reserved for this), W takes two values
   (1 bit), t is a placeholder with only one value defined, z has only 3
   values defined (2 bits) and v has 3 values (2 bits).  In a rought
   esitimation, the number of information bits is at minimum 10 bit.  So
   64 bit are enought also for future application code evolutions.


4.  Optical Interface Class Semantic

   The semantic of the Optical Interface Class must be defined outside
   the control plane but it must be unique for all control plane for
   every control plane function or network node.  Within this
   hypothesis, we need to solve the problem on how to make any network
   element aware of the semantic behind the Optical Interface Class and



Martinelli, et al.      Expires September 7, 2012               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        WSON Optical Interface Class            March 2012


   make sure it can figure out the right value for its interfaces.

   An example of semantic is the "Application Code" within [ITU-G.698.1]
   and [ITU-G.698.2].  The Application Code could be easily represented
   by the Optical Interface Class index (or number).  This number might
   be used as an index to access a table containing all the values
   associated with a specific interface using mechanisms like Directory
   Services.  Note that each single interface parameter could be
   retrieved through a MIB.  As an example,
   [draft-galimbe-kunze-g698-2-snmp-mib] gives another example on the
   Optical parameter specification includes the OII definition in
   compliance with [ITU-G.698.2] Chapter 5.3.

   Every time a new optical interface is defined or introduced into the
   market, only a MIB update will be required but there will be no
   impact on WSON protocols.

   Note also that the Control Plane may become aware of the Optical
   Interface Class semantic by a various of other ways like the network
   management system or manual provisioning.

   As a matter of fact in current WSON technology, standard and
   proprietary information must co-exist.  The introduction of the
   Optical Interface Class does not change or limit this possibility
   since the class identifier can be a means to access either public or
   vendor specific information.  In term of protocol encoding however,
   this solution has the advantage to limit eventually proprietary
   information in a fixed size field.

6.  IANA Considerations

   Optical Interface code points needs to be assigned by IANA?

   All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
   the update of RFC 2434 [I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis]
   for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do anything, the
   section contains an explicit statement that this is the case (as
   above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section will be
   removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.


7.  Security Considerations

   All drafts are required to have a security considerations section.

Appendix A.  Encoding example

   In this section we try to represent how the encoding will change
   considering the Optical Interface Class.  The main result of the
   Optical interface class will be not encoding saving in term of bytes
   but a simplified protocol support for new optical technologies.

   According to Section 5 of [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rwa-wson-encode] the
   encoding shall foresee a list of: Input Modulation Type, Input FEC
   Type, Input Client Signal Types.  All the basic objects has a lenght
   dependent on values carried on.  For example if the modulation format
   is a standard one, the related sub TLV will be 32 bits, if the
   modulation formart is a proprietary one the length is not known a
   priori.

   Using the concept of interface class the same object will likely
   become as the one represented in Figure 4.

   With the following notes:

   o  Current draft just defines the Optical interface class encoding as
      3 words of 32 bits but, for usage within WSON protocol extentions
      a proper TLV header shall be defined.  In this case we represent a
      list since the original example in
      [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rwa-wson-encode] use lists.

   o  Current example just represent input and output classes by numbers
      (1,2,3) and letters (A,B) since example only shows how encoding is
      simplified.

   o  Optical interface classes has a fixed size while basic encoding
      blocks of [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rwa-wson-encode] have sizes that varies
      depending on proprietary informations.

   As in the example above, the concept of Optical interface class is
   not to save encoding bytes but to keep the optical semantic outside
   of GMPLS protocols.
