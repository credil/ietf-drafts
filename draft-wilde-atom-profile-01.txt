            Profile Support for the Atom Syndication Format
                      draft-wilde-atom-profile-01

Abstract

   The Atom syndication format is a generic XML format for representing
   collections.  Profiles are one way how Atom feeds can indicate that
   they support specific extensions.  To make this support visible on
   the media type level, this specification re-registers the Atom media
   type, and adds a "profile" media type parameter.  This allows
   profiles to become visible at the media type level, so that servers
   as well as clients can indicate support for specific Atom profiles in
   conversations, for example when communicating via HTTP.

Internet-Draft                Atom Profiles                   April 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Atom Syndication Format "is an XML-based document format that
   describes lists of related information known as 'feeds'.  Feeds are
   composed of a number of items, known as 'entries', each with an
   extensible set of attached metadata.  For example, each entry has a
   title."  [1]

   Profiles "can be described as additional semantics that can be used
   to process a resource representation, such as constraints,
   conventions, extensions, or any other aspects that do not alter the
   basic media type semantics.  A profile MUST NOT change the semantics
   of the resource representation when processed without profile
   knowledge, so that clients both with and without knowledge of a
   profiled resource can safely use the same representation."  [2]

   Profiles are identified by URI, and their use can be indicated for a
   representation by adding a link with the registered "profile" link
   relation type, linking to the profile URI.  While this is sufficient
   to represent the fact that a certain representation is using a
   profile, it does not make that fact visible outside of this
   representation.  Ideally, peers communicating their media type, for
   example when communicating via Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
   [5], should be able to indicate the support of certain profiles
   through the media type identifier itself, without changing the base
   media type.

   Because Atom supports generic links through its <link/> element,
   "profile" links can be easily added to a feed, indicating that this
   feed does adhere to a certain profile.  However, on the media type
   level, this feed would still be labeled as application/atom+xml,
   making the profile invisible on that level and thus not allowing it
   to be used in interactions such as content negotiation in HTTP.

   This specification adds a "profile" media type parameter to the
   application/atom+xml media type, thereby making it possible for
   profiles to be exposed at the media type level.  Apart from adding
   that one media type parameter, this specification does not change
   anything about the Atom format itself, or its media type
   registration.


2.  Examples

   Adding a "profile" parameter to the Atom media type adds visibility
   of profiles at the media type level, for example when alternative
   profiles are supported by a service.  It might also help to further
   "specialize" a media type in environments where such a

   "specialization" is useful.  Two examples are intended to illustrate
   these two scenarios.

2.1.  Profiles for Alternatives

   For example, when linking to feeds of media-oriented services, it
   would be possible to expose two feeds, one using MediaRSS, and the
   other one using Podcasts.  Both formats roughly cover the same
   functionality as media-oriented feed-based extensions, but by having
   the ability to expose their capabilities at the media type level,
   HTTP mechanisms and conversations can be used to distinguish between
   these formats.

   In some cases it may be possible to support more than one profile,
   and then it is up for the service to decide whether these should be
   exposed in one representation (which can be exposed by linking to
   multiple profiles from the resource representation and/or in the
   media type parameter), or whether there should be two
   representations, one for each profile.  This decision will probably
   depend on implementation complexity, the trade-off between navigation
   complexity (two representations with one profile each) and processing
   complexity, and also the size of the profile data, because in
   particular in the case of overlapping profiles, there might be many
   redundancies.

   Thus, which way to go for multiple profiles is not a question that
   has one correct answer; it depends on the profiles, and on the
   services that are built around them.

2.2.  Profiles for Specializations

   Feed-based services may provide additional features in feeds that are
   represented using Atom's extension mechanisms.  These additional
   features might be useful only for those clients that support them,
   and otherwise might add volume to a feed that is of no value to
   general consumers.  In such a scenario, specialized clients might
   also request their specialized features via profile media type
   parameters, and will then get the feed being "enriched" with the
   additional features.  If clients do not request such a profile or
   request one that is not known to the server, the server responds with
   a generic feed, still allowing them to treat the feed as a generic
   feed (with no additional features being represented).

   Whether services respond with profiles by default or only for
   specific requests about a profile is a matter of policy, and will be
   influenced by factors such as the added volume when adding profile
   data, and the question whether profiles should only be exposed to
   those that specifically ask for them.  Since profiles are not allowed

   to change the semantics of the media type itself, such a decision can
   depend on the trade-off being a matter of expressivity, and not
   whether it will break clients under some circumstances.


3.  Profile Parameter Definition

   The profile parameter for the application/atom+xml media type allows
   one or more profile URIs to be specified.  These profile URIs have
   the identifier semantics defined in [2], and when appearing as media
   type parameter, they have the same semantics as if they had been
   associated with the resource URI through other means, such as using
   one or more <link profile="" href=""/> elements as children of the
   <feed> element.

   As a general rule, media type parameters must be quoted unless they
   are tokens.  For the "profile" media type parameter defined here,
   this means that is must be quoted.  It contains a non-empty list of
   space-separated URIs (the profile URIs).
   profile-param = "profile=" profile-value
   profile-value = <"> profile-URI 0*( 1*SP profile-URI ) <">
   profile-URI   = URI

   The "URI" in the above grammar refers to the "URI" as defined in
   Section 3 of [3]


4.  IANA Considerations

   The media type registration for the media type application/atom+xml
   should be updated according to the following registration.

4.1.  Atom Media Type application/atom+xml

   The Internet media type [6] for an Atom document is application/
   atom+xml.

4.1.1.  Media Type Name

   application

4.1.2.  Subtype Name

   atom+xml

4.1.3.  Required Parameters

   none

4.1.4.  Optional Parameters

   charset: This parameter has semantics identical to the charset
   parameter of the "application/xml" media type as specified in [4].

   profile: This parameter indicates that one or more profiles are used
   in the feed, according to the definition of profiles in [2].  The
   parameter syntax is specified in Section 3 of RFC XXXX

4.1.5.  Encoding Considerations

   Identical to those of "application/xml" as described in [4], Section
   3.2.

4.1.6.  Security Considerations

   As defined in [1].  In addition, as this media type uses the "+xml"
   convention, it shares the same security considerations as described
   in [4], Section 10.

4.1.7.  Interoperability Considerations

   There are no known interoperability issues.

4.1.8.  Published Specification

   [1], RFC XXXX

4.1.9.  Applications which use this media type

   Many.  Atom has become a common foundation for many syndication-
   oriented scenarios, and also has become a commonly used
   representation for collection contents.

4.1.10.  Magic number(s)

   As specified for "application/xml" in [4], Section 3.2.

4.1.11.  File extension(s)

   .atom
