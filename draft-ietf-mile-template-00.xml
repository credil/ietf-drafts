    <t>This document provides guidelines for extensions to <xref
    target="RFC5070">IODEF</xref> for lightweight exchange of incident
    management data, and contains a template for Internet-Drafts describing
    those extensions, in order to ease the work and improve the quality of
    extension descriptions. It also specifies additional Expert Review of XML
    Schemas used to describe these extensions.</t>

<section title="Introduction" anchor="sec-intro">

  <t>Since the specification of <xref target="RFC5070">IODEF</xref>, the
  evolution of the threat environment and the practice of cooperative network
  defense, along with continued implementation and deployment, has indicated
  the need for guidelines for the implementation and extension of IODEF. This
  document provides these guidelines. It starts by describing the
  applicability of IODEF extensions, and the IODEF extension mechanisms,
  before providing a section <xref target="sec-template"/> that is itself
  designed to be copied out and filled in as the starting point of an
  Internet-Draft about an IODEF extension.</t>

  <t>Additionally, IODEF extensions via class extension through AdditionalData
  and RecordItem elements, as per section 5.2 of <xref target="RFC5070"/>,
  generally register their namespaces and schemas with the IANA XML Namespace
  registry at http://www.iana.org/assignments/xml-registry/ns.html and the
  IANA XML Schema registry at
  http://www.iana.org/assignments/xml-registry/schema.html, respectively <xref
  target="RFC3688"/>. In addition to schema reviews required by IANA, these
  registry requests should be accompanied by a review by IODEF experts to
  ensure the specified AdditionalData and/or RecordItem contents are
  compatible with IODEF and with other existing IODEF extensions. This
  document specifies that review in <xref target="sec-iana"/>.</t>

</section>

<section title="Applicability of Extensions to IODEF">

  <t>Before deciding to extend IODEF, the first step is to determine whether
  an IODEF extension is a good fit for a given problem. There are two sides to
  this question:</t>

  <list style="numbers">
    <t>Does the problem involve the reporting or sharing of information about an incident? "Incident" is not defined in the terminology for IODEF, but for purposes of IODEF can be loosely described as "something that happened that has some impact on the information security situation of an entity", with quite a bit of leeway for interpretation. If the answer to this question is unequivocally "No", then IODEF is probably not a good choice as a base technology for the application area.</t>
    <t>Can IODEF adequately represent information about the incident without extension? IODEF has a reasonably rich set of incident-relevant classes. If, after examination of the problem area and the IODEF specification, the answer to this question is "Yes", then extension is not necessary.</t>
  </list>

  <t>A non-exhaustive list of good candidate extensions to IODEF includes:</t>
 
  <list style="numbers">
    <t>Allowing standardized reference to external information bases about incidents and incident-relevant information: leveraging existing work in describing aspects of incidents to make IODEF more expressive</t>
    <t>Allowing the description of new types of entities (e.g., related actors) or new types of characteristics of entities (e.g., financial services-related information) involved in an IODEF incident report</t>
    <t>Allowing additional semantic or metadata labeling of IODEF Documents (e.g., for handling or disposition instructions, or compliance with data protection and data retention regulations)</t>
  </list>

</section>

<section title="Selecting a Mechanism for IODEF Extension" anchor="sec-mechanisms">

  <t>IODEF was designed to be extended through any combination of:</t>

    <list style="numbers">
      <t>extending the enumerated values of Attributes, as per section 5.1 of <xref target="RFC5070"/>;</t>
      <t>class extension through AdditionalData and RecordItem elements, as per section 5.2 of <xref target="RFC5070"/>; and/or</t>
      <t>containment of the IODEF-Document element within an external XML Document, itself containing extension data.</t>
    </list>

    <t>Note that in this final case, the extension will not be directly
    interoperable with IODEF implementations, and must "unwrap" the IODEF
    document from its container; nevertheless, this may be appropriate for
    certain use cases involving integration with IODEF within external
    schemas. Extensions using containment of an IODEF-Document are not further
    treated in this document, though the document template in <xref
    target="sec-template"/> may be of some use in defining them.</t>

    <t>Certain attributes containing enumerated values within certain IODEF
    elements may be extended. For an attribute named "foo", this is achieved
    by giving the value of "foo" as "ext-value", and adding a new attribute
    named "ext-foo" containing the extended value. The attributes which can be
    extended in this way are defined in <xref target="RFC5070"/>, and limited
    to the following:</t>

    <list style="symbols">
      <t>Incident@purpose</t>
      <t>Contact@role</t>
      <t>Contact@type</t>
      <t>RegistryHandle@registry</t>
      <t>Impact@type</t>
      <t>TimeImpact@metric</t>
      <t>TimeImpact@duration</t>
      <t>HistoryItem@action</t>
      <t>Expectation@action</t>
      <t>System@category</t>
      <t>Counter@type</t>
      <t>Counter@duration</t>
      <t>Address@category</t>
      <t>NodeRole@category</t>
      <t>RecordPattern@type</t>
      <t>RecordPattern@offsetunit</t>
      <t>AdditionalData@dtype</t>
      <t>RecordItem@dtype</t>
    </list>

    <t>An example definition of an attribute extension is given in <xref
    target="ext-defenum"/>.</t>

    <t>IODEF documents can contain extended scalar or XML data using an
    AdditionalData element or a RecordItem element. Scalar data extensions
    MUST set the "dtype" attribute of the containing element to the data type
    to reference one of the IODEF data types as enumerated in <xref
    target="sec-types"/>, and SHOULD define the use the "meaning" and
    "formatid" attributes to explain the content of the element.</t>

    <t>XML extensions within an AdditionalData or RecordItem element use a
    dtype of "xml", and SHOULD define a schema for the root element within the
    AdditionalData or RecordItem attribute. An example definition of an
    element definition is given in <xref target="ext-defelem"/>.</t>

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="sec-security">
  <t>This document defines a template for MILE extensions to the IODEF and RID
  documents; as such, it has no security considerations on its own.</t>

<section title="Document Template" anchor="sec-template">

    <t>The document template given in this section is provided as a starting
    point for writing an Internet-Draft describing an IODEF extension.</t>

   <section title="Introduction" anchor="ext-intro">

    <t>The introduction section introduces the problem being solved by the
    extension, and motivates the development and deployment of the
    extension.</t>

  </section>

  <section title="Terminology" anchor="ext-terminology">

    <t>The terminology section introduces and defines terms specific to the
    document. Terminology from <xref target="RFC5070"/> or <xref
    target="RFC6045"/> should be referenced in this section, but not redefined
    or copied. If <xref target="RFC2119"/> terms are used in the document,
    this should be noted in the terminology section.</t>

  </section>

  <section title="Applicability" anchor="ext-applicability">

    <t>The applicability section defines the use cases to which the extension
    is applicable, and details any requirements analysis done during the
    development of the extension. The primary goal of this section is to allow
    readers to see if an extension is indeed intended to solve a particular
    problem. This should also the scope of the extension, as appropriate, by
    pointing out any non-obvious situations to which it is not intended to
    apply.</t>

    <t>In addition to defining the applicability, this section may also
    present example situations, which should then be detailed in the examples
    section, below.</t>

  </section>

  <section title="Extension Definition" anchor="ext-definition">

    <t>This section defines the extension.</t>
    
     <t>Extensions to enumerated types are defined in one subsection for each
    attribute to be extended, enumerating the new values with an explanation
    of the meaning of the new value. An example enumeration extension is shown
    in <xref target="ext-defenum"/>, below.</t>

    <t>Element extensions are defined in one subsection for each element, in
    top-down order, from the element contained within AdditionalData or
    RecordItem; an example element extension is shown in <xref
    target="ext-defelem"/>, below. Each element should be described by a UML
    diagram as in <xref target="fig-element"/>, followed by a description of
    each of the attributes, and a short description of each of the child
    elements. Child elements should then be defined in a subsequent
    subsection, if not already defined in the IODEF document itself, or in
    another referenced MILE extension document.</t>

<figure title="Example UML Element Diagram"  anchor="fig-element">
  <artwork><![CDATA[
+---------------------+
| Element             |
+---------------------+
| TYPE attribute0     |<>----------[ChildExactlyOne]
| TYPE attribute1     |<>--{0..1}--[ChildZeroOrOne]
|                     |<>--{0..*}--[ChildZeroOrMore]
|                     |<>--{1..*}--[ChildOneOrMore]
+---------------------+
]]></artwork>
</figure>

    <t>Elements containing child elements should indicate the multiplicity of those child elements, as shown in the figure above. Allowable TYPEs are discussed in the following subsection.</t>

    <section title="IODEF Data Types" anchor="sec-types">
  
    	<t>The allowable TYPEs for attributes within IODEF are enumerated in section 2 of <xref target="RFC5070"/>, and consist of:</t>
  
	    <list style="symbols">
	      <t>INTEGER</t>
	      <t>REAL</t>
	      <t>CHARACTER</t>
	      <t>STRING</t>
	      <t>ML_STRING (for strings in encodings other than that of the enclosing document)</t>
	      <t>BYTE for bytes or byte vectors in Base 64 encoding</t>
	      <t>HEXBIN for bytes in ascii-hexadecimal encoding</t>
	      <t>ENUM for enumerated types; allowable values of the enumeration must be defined in the attribute definition</t>
	      <t>DATETIME for <xref target="RFC3339">ISO 8601:2000</xref> encoded timestamps</t>
	      <t>TIMEZONE for timezones as encoded in section 2.9 of <xref target="RFC5070"/>.</t>
	      <t>PORTLIST for port lists as encoded in section 2.10 of <xref target="RFC5070"/>.</t>
	      <t>POSTAL for postal addresses as defined in section 2.23 of <xref target="RFC4519"/>.</t>
	      <t>NAME for names of natural or legal persons as defined in section 2.3 of <xref target="RFC4519"/>.</t>
	      <t>PHONE for telephone numbers as defined in section 2.35 of <xref target="RFC4519"/>.</t>
	      <t>EMAIL for email addresses as defined in section 3.4.1. of <xref target="RFC2822"/>.</t>
	      <t>URL for URLs as in <xref target="RFC2396"/>.</t>
	    </list>

      <t>In addition to these simple data types, IODEF provides a compound
      data type for representing network address information. Addresses
      included within an extension element should be represented by containing
      an IODEF:Address element, which supports IPv4 and <xref
      target="RFC2373"/> IPv6 addresses, as well as MAC, ATM, and BGP
      autonomous system numbers. Application-layer addresses should be
      represented with the URL simple attribute type, instead.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Example Enumerated Type Extension Definition: E.164 Address" anchor="ext-defenum">
      <t>This example extends the IODEF Address element to support the encoding of ENUM-mapped telephone numbers <xref target="RFC6116"/>.</t>
        
      <t>Attribute: Address@category</t>
      
      <t>Extended value(s): enum-e164</t>
      
      <t>Content format: An E.164 telephone number encoded as a domain name in the e164.int space, e.g. "2.1.2.1.5.5.5.2.1.2.1.e164.int." for +1 212 555 1212, as per section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC6116"/>.</t>
      
      <t>Additional considerations: none.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Example Element Definition: Test" anchor="ext-defelem">
      <t>This example defines the Test class for labeling IODEF test data.</t>

      <t>The Test class is intended to be included within an AdditionalData element in an IODEF Document. If a Test element is present, it indicates that an IODEF Document contains test data, not a reference to a real incident.</t>
      
      <t>The Test class contains information about how the test data was generated.</t>
      
<figure title="The Test class"  anchor="fig-test">
  <artwork><![CDATA[

            <t>unit. The test data is intended for unit testing of an implementation, and may be included with the implementation to support this as part of the build and deployment process.</t>
            <t>interoperability. The test data is intended for interoperability testing of an implementation, and may be freely shared to support this purpose.</t>
          </list>

  <section title="Examples" anchor="ext-examples">

    <t>This section contains example IODEF-Documents illustrating the
    extension. If example situations are outlined in the applicability
    section, documents for those examples should be provided in the same order

    <t>Any <xref target="RFC3552">security considerations</xref> raised by
