Internet-Draft          Additional Link Relations           October 2012


1.  Introduction

   The fundamental model for Web Links and the Registry of Link
   Relations are established by [RFC5988].  This specification defines
   and adds the following additional types of link relations to the
   registry: about, preview, privacy-policy, terms-of-service, and type.


2.  "about"

   The "about" Link relation can be used to refer to a resource that is
   the subject of the link's context.  Multiple subjects can be
   indicated through the use of multiple "about" link relations.

   For example, if the context resource is a review about a particular
   product, the "about" link can be used to reference the URL of the
   product:

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Type: application/json
     Link: <http://store.example.org/product/abc>; rel="about"

     {...}


3.  "preview"

   The "preview" Link relation can be used to refer to a resource that
   serves as a preview of the link's context, for instance, a screen
   capture of a video, or a brief snippet of audio from a song.

   For example, issue a HTTP HEAD request to a URI representing a large
   video or image file might return a link to a short or lower quality
   preview of the original:

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Text: video/mpeg
     Link: <http://example.org/preview/10-second-preview.mpg>;
       rel="preview"; type="video/mpeg"


4.  "privacy-policy"

   The "privacy-policy" Link relation can be used to refer to a resource
   describing the privacy policy associated with the link's context.
   The privacy policy can be any resource that discloses what personal
   information about the user is collected, and how that personal
   information is stored, used, managed and disclosed to other parties.



Snell                    Expires April 13, 2013                 [Page 3]

   For example, an HTTP server that collects personal information about
   a user throughout the course of the user's interaction with the
   service can include "privacy-policy" Links within all HTTP Responses
   using any combination of Link headers or links embedded in the
   response payload:

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Type: text/html

     <html>
       <head>
         ...
         <link rel="privacy-policy" href="/privacy-policy.html" />
         ...
       </head>
       <body>
         ...
       </body>
     </html>

   Note that in the absence of clear legal obligations placed on an
   entity either through contract or law, the presence of a "privacy-
   policy" Link does not constitute a legally binding obligation on the
   part of the service.  The linked resource can only be interpreted as
   a description of the expected practice.

   It is recommended that publishers of privacy policy resources linked
   to using the "privacy-policy" Link relation provide a clear and
   simple mechanism for signaling when changes to the Privacy Policy
   resource have been made, such as generating a new Entity Tag for the
   resource or generating a hash over the Privacy Policy's content.  How
   much mechanisms are utilized are out of the scope of this
   specification, however.


5.  "terms-of-service"

   The "terms-of-service" Link relation can be used to refer to a
   resource describing the Terms of Service associated with the link's
   context.  The Terms of Service can be any resource that describes the
   rules to which a consumer of the service must agree to follow when
   using the service provided by the link's context.

   For example, an HTTP server can include "terms-of-service" Links
   within all HTTP Responses using any combination of Link headers or
   links embedded in the response payload:

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Type: text/html

     <html>
       <head>
         ...
         <link rel="terms-of-service" href="/tos.html">
         ...
       </head>
       <body>
         ...
       </body>
     </html>

   It must be noted that the Terms of Service linked to using this link
   relation carries no legal weight and can be ignored with impunity in
   the absence of an explicit, legally enforceable contract.  The linked
   Terms of Service are simply a notice of the terms that may be
   expected to apply once a contract is established.


6.  "type"

   The "type" Link relation can be used to indicate that the context
   resource is an instance of the resource identified by the target IRI.

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Type: text/plain
     Link: <http://example.org/Person/givenName>; type="type"

     Sally

   When used within the header of an HTTP message, the "type" specified
   by the type link relation cannot be confused with the content type of
   the payload as given by the Content-Type header.  The "type" link
   relation references the payload's abstract semantic type whereas the
   Content-Type header identifies the specific serialization format of
   the payload.

   If the context can be considered to be an instance of multiple
   semantic types, multiple "type" link relations can be used.


7.  IANA Considerations

   The Registry of Link Relations should be updated with the following
   entries:
