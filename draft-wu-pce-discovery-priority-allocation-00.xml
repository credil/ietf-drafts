    <abstract>
      <t>Each network domain may contain multiple PCE servers. It provides
      redundancy to the PCCs in the event of a server failure. However load
      balance decision is made by PCC,it doesn’t enable real load balance
      across the PCE servers if PCC still tries PCE one by one and PCE doesn’t
      indicate the load status to the PCC. </t>

      <t>This document proposes new PCE discovery sub-TLV that can be
      announced as attribute in the OSPF advertisement (defined in [RFC5088 ])
      to distribute priority information. </t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>Usually a single PCE server sits per domain in the nework. The PCE
      server disseminates its address in the network using OSPF [RFC5088] or
      ISIS [RFC5089] and the PCCs connect to it automatically. However in some
      cases, each network domain may contain multiple PCE servers. It provides
      redundancy to the PCCs in the event of a server failure.</t>

      <t>However load balance decision is made by PCC,it doesn’t enable real
      load balance across the PCE servers if PCC still tries PCE one by one
      and PCE doesn’t indicate the load status to the PCC (e.g., the number of
      incoming requests that have already targeted to the PCE).</t>

      <t>This document proposes new PCE discovery TLV that can be announced as
      attribute in the OSPF advertisement (defined in [RFC5088 ]) to
      distribute priority information. </t>

    <section title="PCE-ALLOCATION-PRIORITY Sub-TLV for PCE Load Balancing">
      <t>The PCE-Allocated-Priority sub-TLV is an optional sub-TLV used to
      indicate allocated priority of each PCE. The format of the sub-TLVs is
      identical to the TLV format used by the Traffic Engineering Extensions
      to OSPF [RFC3630]. It MAY be present within the PCED TLV. It MUST NOT be
      present more than once. If it appears more than once, only the first
      occurrence is processed and any others MUST be ignored. </t>

      <t>The value field of the PCE-ALLOCATED-PRIORITY sub-TLV is expressed as
      32-bit unsigned integer value..</t>

      <t>The format of the PCE-ALLOCATED-PRIORITY sub-TLV is as follows:</t>

      Value:    This contains allocated priority value for each PCE 
                server. The priority value can be allocated based 
                on PCE load or incoming request to the PCE server.

      <section title="Use of PCE-ALLOCATION-PRIORITY sub-TLV for PCE discovery">
        <t>Multiple servers can be present in a single network for redundancy
        in which case each PCE server is allocated with a priority value. The
        priority can be allocated based on PCE load (e.g., incoming request to
        the PCE server) announced as attribute in the OSPF advertisement. The
        PCC can be configured to use the highest priority PCE server that is
        available or specify the priority of a computation request when
        multiple PCEs has already been found using OSPF[RFC5088].</t>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA maintains the registry for the TLVs. PCE-allocated-priority
      sub-TLV will require one new type code per sub-TLV defined in this
      document. </t>

            <t>In many standards track documents several words are used to
            signify the requirements in the specification. These words are
            often capitalized. This document defines these words as they
            should be interpreted in IETF documents. Authors who follow these
            guidelines should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of
            their document: <list>
                <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",

                in RFC 2119.</t>

            <t>Note that the force of these words is modified by the
