Internet-Draft   NAT Coordination Using Port Allocation     October 2012


1.  Application Scenario

   PCP can be used to control an upstream device to achieve the
   following goals:

   1.  A plain IP address (i.e., a non-shared) can be assigned to a
       given subscriber because it subscribed to a service which uses a
       protocol that don't embed a transport number or because the NAT
       is the only deployed platform to manage IP addresses.

   2.  An application (e.g., sensor) does not need to listen to a whole
       range of ports available on a given IP address.  Only a limited
       set of ports are used to bind its running services.  For such
       devices, the external port(s) and IP address can be delegated to
       that application and therefore avoid enforcing NAT in the network
       side for its associated flows.  The NAT in the PCP- controlled
       device should be bypassed.

   3.  A device able to restrict its source ports can be delegated an
       external port restricted IP address.  The PCP- controlled device
       should be instructed to by-pass the NAT when handling flows
       destined/issued to that device.

   This document extends PCP with the ability to reserve port sets
   instead of individual ports.  This is motivated by the need to
   offload to a port-restricted device in lightweight 4over6
   [I-D.cui-softwire-b4-translated-ds-lite], reduce the logging and
   enhance the performance of the CGN.

   Using individual MAP requests to reserve all individual ports of a
   given port set can not achieve this goal because an additional
   indication is needed to instruct the PCP-controlled device to not
   enforce a NAT for packets matching these ports.  A candidate solution
   is to define a new Option to request for this feature be enforced by
   the PCP-controlled device.  Nevertheless, this solution is not
   efficient when large port sets are assigned (e.g., address sharing
   ratio of 1:2 or 1:8).  Another issue, is when no NAT is enforced in
   the PCP-controlled device but only a Port Range Router (PRR)
   function, the request has not to indicate the internal ports.

   For those reasons, a new PCP OpCode is defined in this document.


2.  MAP_PORT_SET Opcode

   This section defines a new Opcode to request a port set from a PCP-
   controlled device.

   The format of MAP_PORT_SET is designed to be close to the MAP message
   format.  The port set is encoded using a port mask to convey a
   contiguous port range.

   By analogy, a port set binding can be seen as an aggregate of MAP
   mappings.  When assigning a port set to a PCP Client, the PCP-
   controlled device maintains a binding between the source IP address
   of the PCP request, the assigned external IP address and the assigned
   port set.  Allocating port sets can greatly reduce individual MAP
   requests for a PCP client when requesting a bulk of ports at one
   time.  This mechanism can be applied for lightweight 4over6
   [I-D.cui-softwire-b4-translated-ds-lite] in port-set allocation
   process.  It can also be applied to stateless PCP-controlled device,
   in which the Internal address, External address and Port set is
   determined algorithmically.

      MAP_PORT_SET: Create an explicit dynamic mapping between an
      Internal IP Address and an External IP Address + Port set

   It is totally up to the PCP server to determine the port-set quota
   for each PCP client.  In addition, when the PCP-controlled device
   supports multiple port-sets delegation for a given PCP client, the
   PCP client MAY re-initiate a PCP request to get another port set when
   it has exhausted all the ports within the port-set.

   PCP-controlled device SHOULD provide a configuration option to allow
   administrators to configure the size of each individual port set
   (denoted as MAX_REQUEST_QUOTA) to be assigned and the size of the
   total ports for a PCP client (denoted as MAX_USER_QUOTA).

2.1.  MAP_PORT_SET Operation Packet Formats

   The MAP_PORT_SET Opcode has a similar packet layout for both requests
   and response.  Figure 1 shows the format of the MAP_PORT_SET request.

               Figure 1: MAP_PORT_SET Opcode Request format

   These fields are described below:

   o  Requested lifetime (in common header): Requested lifetime of this
      port set mapping, in seconds.  The value 0 indicates "delete".

   o  PORT_SET_Nonce: Random value chosen by the PCP client which SHOULD
      be different for individual PCP requests.  But the same value MUST
      be kept in one request re-transmission.  See Section 11.2 of
      [I-D.ietf-pcp-base].

   o  Protocol: the default value is zero (to indicate all transport
      protocols).

   o  Reserved bits: 24 bits MUST be set to 0.

   o  Suggested Port Set Index (PSI): The PSI indicates the value of the
      significant bits of the Port Mask.  By default, PSI is set to 0 in
      a request.  It can also convey Suggested Port Set Index if the
      client has a hint on it.  The first k bits on the left of the
      2-octet field is the Port Set Index value, with the rest of the
      field right padding zeros.

   o  Suggested Port Set Mask (PSM): The PSM indicates the position of
      the bits that are used to build the Port Set Index.  The 1 values
      in the Port Set Mask indicate by their position the significant
      bits of the Port Set Value.  By default, PSM is set to 0 in a
      request.  It can also convey Suggested Port Set Mask if the client

      has a hint on it.  The first k bits on the left is padding ones
      while the remained (16-k) bits of the 2-octet field on the right
      is padding zeros.

   o  Suggested External IP Address: Suggested external IPv4 or IPv6
      address.  Same as Section 10.1 of [I-D.ietf-pcp-base].

In the context of Port Set Option, the port number should consist of
   port set prefix and port number suffix.  The port set prefix can be
   got from Port Set Index and Port Set Mask, while port number suffix
   can change continuously.  The format of port number is shown below.

           0                                                    15

           +-----------------------+-----------------------------+
           |<-------k bits-------->|<--------(16-k) bits-------->|

   In order to exclude the system ports ([I-D.ietf-tsvwg-iana-ports]) or
   ports saved by SPs, the former port-sets that contains well-known
   ports SHOULD NOT be assigned.

2.2.  MAP_PORT_SET Mapping Table Example

   The following table depicts an example of the mapping table in the
   PCP Server enabling MAP_PORT_SET OpCode.

3.  MAP_PORT_SET Operation

3.1.  Generating a MAP_PORT_SET Request

   The MAP_PORT_SET request MUST contain values in the Suggested IP
   Address field, Suggested Port Set Index and Suggested Port Mask.
   However, this port set indicated in the request of the PCP Client is
   only a hint; it is up to the PCP Server to assign a port set.

   If a PCP Client fails to receive an expected response from a server,
   the PCP client follows the same retransmission procedure defined for
   MAP in the base PCP specification (section 8.1.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-base]).  The PORT_SET_Nonce should be copied from the
   previous MAP_PORT_SET request.

   If a PCP Client uses out all the ports in the current assigned port
   set, it MAY generate a new MAP_PORT_SET Request to get another
   delegated port-set.  The Client MUST use a different Mapping Nonce
   for different MAP_PORT_SET requests.  If USER_EX_QUOTA error is
   received from the server, the PCP client SHOULD NOT request for
   another new port set.

3.2.  Renewing a MAP_PORT_SET Mapping

   Port Set mapping renewal for MAP_PORT_SET MUST follow the same
   procedure for an individual MAP mapping (section 11.2.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] ) except for considerations related to the
   internal port (which is included in a MAP request but not present in
   a MAP_PORT_SET).

Internet-Draft   NAT Coordination Using Port Allocation     October 2012


   The MAP_PORT_SET request MUST include the currently assigned IP
   address and port-set in the Suggested IP address,Suggested Port Set
   Index and Suggested Port Set Mask.

3.3.  Processing a MAP_PORT_SET Request

   The PCP server SHOULD take exactly the same order as in (section 11.3
   of [I-D.ietf-pcp-base]).  In particular, as there is no Internal Port
   in MAP_PORT_SET anymore, all the processes regarding to Internal Port
   should be neglected accordingly.

   Considerations related to the assignment of the external IP Address
   are the same as what is defined in (section 11.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-base]).

   The procedures regarding to the port set are similar to the external
   port processes in MAP Opcode (section 11.3 of [I-D.ietf-pcp-base]),
   except that the whole port-set should be treated consistently in
   MAP_PORT_SET Opcode.  The same operations for handling the Suggested
   external port for a MAP request are applied on the Suggested Port
   Set.

   The procedures for PORT_SET_Nonce is exactly the same as the Mapping
   Nonce field defined in (section 11.3 of [I-D.ietf-pcp-base]).  The
   PCP server only needs to remember ONE PORT_SET_Nonce for each mapping
   (Internal IP Address, External IP address and Port Set).

   The error codes in MAP_PORT_SET Response mainly have the following
   possibilities:

   o  If the PCP server or PCP-controlled device does not support
      MAP_PORT_SET Opcode, the error UNSUPP_OPCODE MUST be returned.

   o  If an option does not make sense, (e.g., the PREFER_FAILURE Option
      is included in a request with lifetime=0, etc.,), the request is
      invalid and generates a MALFORMED_OPTION error.  This procedure is
      the same with section 10.3 of [I-D.ietf-pcp-base].

   If the requested lifetime is zero, it indicates a request to delete
   an existing mapping.

   A PCP server SHOULD maintain MAX_USER_QUOTA and MAX_REQUEST_QUOTA.
   MAX_USER_QUOTA is to indicate the maximum number of ports a
   subscriber may get in total, and MAX_REQUEST_QUOTA is to indicate the
   maximum number of ports in each request.  Therefore, one PCP Client
   will have up to N mappings, in which N SHOULD NOT be larger than
   floor(MAX_USER_QUOTA/MAX_REQUEST_QUOTA).  The specific mechanism to
   configure the quotas is out of scope.

Internet-Draft   NAT Coordination Using Port Allocation     October 2012


   If the PCP server is configured to allocate multiple port-set
   allocation for one subscriber, the same External address SHOULD be
   assigned to one subscriber in multiple port-set requests to guarantee
   the consistency.

   To optimize the number of mapping entries maintained by the PCP
   server, it is RECOMMENDED to configure the server to assign the
   maximum allowed port set in a single response.  This policy SHOULD be
   configurable.

   When MAP_PORT_SET is applied to stateless PCP-controlled device, the
   PCP server returns an answer indicating the external IP address and
   port-set as seen by remote peers.

3.4.  Processing a MAP_PORT_SET Response

   On receiving a MAP_PORT_SET Response, the same procedure as the one
   for individual mapping [section 10.4 of [I-D.ietf-pcp-base]] MUST be
   followed by the PCP Client to validate the response (except the
   considerations related to the internal port).


4.  Mapping Lifetime and Deletion

   The procedure for port-set mapping lifetime and deletion is also the
   same with individual mapping [section 10.5 of [I-D.ietf-pcp-base]].


5.  PREFER_FAILURE Option for MAP_PORT_SET Opcode

   This option [section 10.2 of [I-D.ietf-pcp-base]] can be applied to
   MAP_PORT_SET Opcode indicating that if the PCP server cannot map the
   suggested External Address and port-set, the PCP server should not
   create a mapping.


6.  Coexistence with MAP OpCode

   Normally, the PCP server for MAP_PORT_SET will not run NAT.  So there
   is no NAT binding in PCP and the PCP server will not run MAP OpCode
   for the same subscriber.  In the case when the PCP client is embedded
   in the host and the PCP server keeps the NAT bindings for some
   special-purpose applications, the external address and the port
   allocated to the subscriber should be consistent with the ones in
   MAP_PORT_SET response.

7.  MAP_PORT_SET Failover

   The failover mechanism in MAP [section 14 in [I-D.ietf-pcp-base]] and
   [I-D.boucadair-pcp-failure] can also be applied to MAP_PORT_SET.

   The only difference compared to MAP is the amount of Mapping entries
   in MAP_PORT_SET PCP server is much less than MAP.  Therefore, the
   cost of state synchronization has been greatly reduced in
   MAP_PORT_SET.


8.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations discussed in [I-D.ietf-pcp-base]
   have to be taken into account.


9.  IANA Considerations
