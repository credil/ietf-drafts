Internet-Draft         Simple Web Discovery (SWD)              July 2012


1.  Introduction

   Simple Web Discovery (SWD) defines an HTTPS GET based mechanism to
   discover the location of a given type of service for a given
   principal starting only with a domain name.  SWD requests use query
   parameters to specify a URI for the principal and another URI for the
   type of service being sought.  If the request is successful then the
   response, by default, is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
   [RFC4627] object containing an array of URIs that point to where the
   principal has instances of services of the requested type.

   For example, let us say that a requester wants to discover where Joe
   keeps his calendar.  The requester could take Joe's e-mail address,
   "joe@example.com", and use its domain to create an HTTPS GET request
   of the following form (with long lines broken for display purposes
   only):
   GET /.well-known/simple-web-discovery
       ?principal=mailto:joe@example.com
       &service=urn:example:service:calendar HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
    "locations": ["https://calendars.example.net/calendars/joseph"]
   }

   Note: The request-URI is left unencoded in the above example for the
   sake of readability.  The query parameters above would actually be
   encoded as "?principal=mailto%3Ajoe%40example.com&service=urn%3Aexamp
   le%3Aservice%3Acalendar".

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in Key words for use in
   RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels [RFC2119].


2.  Simple Web Discovery Request

   Domains that support SWD requests MUST make available a SWD server
   for their domain at the path "/.well-known/simple-web-discovery".
   The syntax and semantics of "/.well-known" are defined in RFC 5785
   [RFC5785]. "simple-web-discovery" MUST point to a SWD server
   compliant with this specification.

Internet-Draft         Simple Web Discovery (SWD)              July 2012


   SWD servers MUST support receiving SWD requests via TLS 1.2 [RFC5246]
   and MAY support other transport layer security mechanisms of
   equivalent security.  SWD servers MUST reject SWD requests sent over
   plain HTTP or any other transport that does not provide both privacy
   and validation of the server's identity.

   A SWD server is queried using an HTTPS GET request with the
   previously specified path along with a query segment containing a
   form encoded using the application/x-www-form-urlencoded encoding
   algorithm as defined in HTML 4.01 [W3C.REC-html401-19991224].  The
   form MUST contain two name/value pairs that MUST appear exactly once,
   "principal" and "service".  Both name/value pairs MUST have values
   that are set to URIs [RFC3986].  If any of the previous requirements
   are not met in a SWD request, then the request MUST be rejected with
   a 400 Bad Request.

   The SWD request form MAY contain additional name/value pairs but if
   those name/value pairs are not recognized by the SWD server then the
   SWD server MUST ignore them for processing purposes.

   The "principal" query component is a URI that identifies an entity.
   The "service" query component is a URI that identifies a service
   type.  The semantics of the SWD query is "Please return the
   location(s) of instances of the specified service type associated
   with the specified principal".  The definition of URIs used to
   identify principals and services are outside the scope of this
   specification.


3.  Simple Web Discovery Responses

3.1.  Response Containing One or More Locations

   Unless another content-type is negotiated, a 200 OK response to a SWD
   request that contains the information requested MUST return content
   of type application/json [RFC4627].  The JSON response MUST contain a
   JSON object that contains a member pair whose name is the string
   "locations" and whose value is an array of strings that are each a
   URI pointing to a location where the desired service type belonging
   to the specified principal can be found.  There are no semantics
   associated with the order in which the URIs are listed in the array.

   The JSON object MAY contain other members but a receiver of the
   object MAY ignore any member pairs whose name it does not recognize.

3.2.  Redirecting All Simple Web Discovery Requests

   SWD requests by definition start off by being issued to the
   "/.well-known/simple-web-discovery" location.  But locating a SWD
   server at a root location can prove inconvenient.  To enable service
   level redirection, a SWD server MAY return a 200 OK to an HTTPS
   request with a content type of application/json (or whatever other
   content type has been negotiated) that contains a JSON object that
   contains a member pair whose name is the string
   "SWD_service_redirect" whose value is a JSON object with a member
   pair whose name is "location" and whose value is a string that
   encodes a URI.  Optionally, the JSON object value of
   "SWD_service_redirect" MAY also contain a member whose name is
   "expires" and whose value is a JSON number that encodes an integer.

   A SWD compliant client MUST support the "SWD_service_redirect"
   response.

   The JSON objects MAY contain other members but a receiver of the
   objects MAY ignore any pairs whose name it does not recognize.

   The "location" member identifies the URI that the caller MUST
   redirect all SWD requests for that domain to until the "expires" time
   has passed.  SWD requests for the redirected domain MUST be
   constructed by taking the URI returned in the "location" and using it
   as the base URI to which the SWD form arguments are then added as
   query parameters.  The location URI MUST NOT include a query
   component.

   The following is an example of redirect messages (with long lines
   broken for display purposes only):

   GET /.well-known/simple-web-discovery
       ?principal=mailto:joe@example.com
       &service=urn:example:service:calendar HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
    "SWD_service_redirect":
     {
      "location": "https://swd.example.com/swd_server",
      "expires": 1300752001
     }
   }

   GET /swd_server
       ?principal=mailto:joe@example.com
       &service=urn:example:service:calendar HTTP/1.1
   Host: swd.example.com

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
    "locations": ["https://calendars.example.net/calendars/joseph"]
   }

   Note: The request-URIs are left unencoded in the above example for
   the sake of readability.

   The "location" URI MUST be an HTTPS URL.

   The optional "expires" member identifies the point in time at which
   the caller MUST NOT redirect its SWD requests for that domain to the
   previously obtained "location" and MUST instead return to the
   "/.well-known/simple-web-discovery" location.  The value of the
   "expires" member MUST encode the number of seconds from 1970-01-
   01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until the desired date/time.  See RFC
   3339 [RFC3339] for details regarding date/times in general and UTC in
   particular.  If the "expires" value is in the past or if the value is
   more than one hour in the future then the response MUST be treated as
   if it didn't contain an "expires" value.

   If the "expires" value is omitted or if its value is incorrect then
   the "expires" value MUST be treated as having a value of exactly one
   hour into the future.

   If a JSON response is received that contains both a member pair with
   the name "SWD_service_redirect" and a member pair with the name
   "locations" as children of the object root then the
   "SWD_service_redirect" member pair MUST be ignored.

3.3.  401 Unauthorized Response

   A SWD server MAY respond to a request with a 401 Unauthorized
   Response, as described in RFC 2616 [RFC2616], Section 10.  Per the
   RFC, the request MAY be repeated with a suitable Authorization header
   field.  Authorization information may be communicated in this manner,
   including a JSON Web Token [JWT].

3.4.  Other HTTP 1.1 Responses

   A SWD server MAY return other HTTP 1.1 responses, including 404 Not
   Found, 400 Bad Request, and 403 Forbidden.  SWD implementations MUST
   correctly handle these responses.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This specification registers a well-known URI suffix value relative
   to "/.well-known/" in the IANA Well-Known URI registry defined in RFC
   5785 [RFC5785]:

   URI suffix:  simple-web-discovery

   Change controller:  IETF

   Specification document:  [[ this document ]]


5.  Security Considerations

   SWD responses can contain confidential information.  Therefore a,
   general approach is used to require TLS in all cases.  But TLS can
   only provide for privacy and server validation, it cannot validate
   that the requester is authorized to see the results of a query.  The
   exact mechanism used to determine if the requester is authorized to
   see the result of the query is outside the scope of this
   specification.

   Because SWD responses can contain confidential information, the
   requestor may need authorization to receive them.  Standard HTTP
   authorization mechanisms MAY be employed to request authorized
   access, including the use of an HTTP Authorization header field in
   requests, which in turn, may contain a JSON Web Token [JWT], among

Internet-Draft         Simple Web Discovery (SWD)              July 2012


   other authorization data formats.

   The ability to redirect an entire SWD server as defined in this
   document is an obvious attack point.  This is another reason why we
   have mandated TLS, so as to be sure that the redirect can only be
   received over a secure connection.  We have also put in the upper
   limit of 60 minutes for a redirect so as to provide a path for
   regaining control over queries should a successful attack be launched
   to return false redirects.

   The "SWD_service_redirect" capability may cause unanticipated
   failures in cases where a requestor may have permissions to discover
   content at the original SWD endpoint but not the one redirected to,
   or vice-versa.
