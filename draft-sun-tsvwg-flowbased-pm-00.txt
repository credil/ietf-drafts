1.  Introduction

   The IETF IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group has defined a
   series of standard metrics that can be applied to the quality,
   performance and reliability of Internet data delivery services.

   In some cases, it needs to monitor the various time-varying
   performance indexes of the IP network, the performance measurement
   should be based on real service stream and reflect the real
   performance of the network.  The average performance indexes measured
   by the active measurement method may not be suitable in these cases.

   This memo proposes an IP performance measurement method which can
   support on-the-spot measurement, that is, measurement is performed
   online when service is running.  This method is an end-to-end flow-
   based method which can obtain measurement data simply and accurately.
   It injects the OAM packets to the network which are used to carry
   some parameters related to service flow and some statistic
   information.  The OAM packets are processed using the same method as
   its corresponding service flow, so the measurements can reflect the
   network status suffered by the service flow more accurately.

   This IP performance measurement method can monitor the real time
   change of service and reflect the running situation of actual IP
   service.  It can play an important role in the fault diagnosis and
   statistics of the service in IP transmission network.

3.1.  Motivation

   It is required to provide a reasonable estimation measurement of
   delay, jitter and packet loss in IP network (such as backhaul
   network).  The above parameters are functions of time, and are
   stochastic in nature.  Therefore, the mechanism is required to
   provide statistical condition estimations of the IP link status.
   Moreover, since measurement injects some OAM packets to the network,
   it is necessary that the frequency of packet generation is kept at a
   minimum.  Moreover, these packets should not lead to an excessive
   computational overload on the measure device.  In other words, the
   process of generation of these measurement packets should be simple
   and must not overload the transport interface.  The packets must be
   small and infrequent so as not to cause unnecessary overload on the
   network bandwidth or influence the service running on the network.

3.2.  Protocol overview

   Firstly we make some statement for this method.  We define a
   measurement method that can be used in some scene.  The method
   proposed here involves three steps#: connection activation#,
   measurement process and connection deactivation.

   Two types of logical entities are defined, the PM Initiator and the
   PM Responder.

   Firstly the PM Initiator sends a request to the PM Responder to set
   up the PM connection activation.  The PM Responder responds with an
   ACK packet including some parameters based on the request.  When the
   PM Initiator receives the ACK, it will prepare for starting the
   measurement process.

   During the measurement process, the PM Initiator periodically
   generates Forward Monitor (FM) packets with the source and
   destination IP addresses, and other classification information (for
   example DSCP class) of the service packets , which are sent to the PM
   Responder.  The generation and transmission of FM packets can be
   periodical with a specific time interval, or a certain number of
   traffic packets should be sent between two contiguous FM packets.

   The PM Responder receives the FM packets and sends Backward
   Reporting(BR)packets which is constructed according to the FM
   packets.

   The path performance such as the delay, jitter and loss rate etc. are
   calculates by the PM Initiator according to the information in the BR
   packets.

Internet-Draft     Flow-based Performance Measurement          June 2012


   The FM packets have the same source and destination IP addresses,
   even the same DSCP class in some cases with the data packets.  So
   they are carried through the transport network just most like the
   data packets, and delay, jitter and packet loss encountered by them
   resembles the performance as seen by the packets of the actual
   traffic flows.  The FM and BR packets used in this method are small
   enough to produce influence to actual service flow as little as
   possible.

3.3.  Logical Model

   The role and definition of the logical entities and measurement
   packets in this method are defined as follows.

   This method is an end-to-end measurement, so two logical entities are
   defined.

   o  PM Initiator: PM Initiator serves as the sending endpoint, and
      charges for generating and sending the request to initiate a PM
      connection.  It could also send FM packets to collect measurement
      data and generate statistical report.

   o  PM Responder: PM Responder serves as the receiving endpoint, and
      charges for responding the request of initiating a link.  It could
      also send back a BR packet to the sending endpoint once it
      receives the FM package from the PM Initiator.

   One possible scenario of relationships between these roles is shown
   below.

          +---------------+                     +----------------+
          |               |-------------------->|                |
          | PM Initiator  |<--------------------|  PM Responder  |
          +---------------+                     +----------------+


      Figure 1: One possible relationship between PM Initiator and PM
                                 Responder

   There are six types of packets in total, which include four types of
   control packets and two types of measurement packets.

   Note that a new port number is introduced to be assigned by the IANA.
   The assigned port number is used as the destination port number of
   the control packets and measurement packets#, and the source port
   number can be random.

   Control packet:

   o  ACT: It is sent from the PM Initiator to a specific UDP port on PM
      Responder, carries parameters used in negotiation process when
      initiating a PM connection.

   o  ACT-ACK: It is a response for ACT sent by the PM Responder to the
      PM Initiator.

   o  DEA: It is sent by the PM Initiator to the PM Responder for
      disconnecting the PM connection.

   o  DEA-ACK: It is a response for DEA sent by the PM Responder to the
      PM Initiator.

   Measurement packet:

   o  FM (Forward Monitoring): It is sent by the PM Initiator.  The
      format of FM packet payload as defined by this document will be
      shown blow.  FM packet header is constructed in accordance with
      the data packet except the destination port.

   o  BR (Backward Reporting): It is sent by the PM Responder.  The
      format of BR packet payload as defined by this document will be
      shown blow.  It is a response for FM.


4.  Measurement Process

4.1.  Connection Activation

   In the PM connection activation process, both the PM Initiator and
   the PM Responder are assigned a Flow ID for a defined flow (the Flow
   ID is unique in a connection between the PM Initiator and the PM
   Responder).  It should specify how to define the Flow corresponding
   to the measurement instance.  Flow can be defined by different
   combinations of source IP address (SIP), destination IP address
   (DIP), protocol type (PT), DSCP, source port number (sPort) and
   destination port number (dPort).  Three types of combinations are
   suggested: (SIP, DIP, PT), or (SIP, DIP, PT, DSCP) or (SIP, DIP, PT,
   sPort, dPort).  The more the combinational dimensions are, the more
   fine-grained can be the monitoring of data flow.

   Before starting the measurement, a connection should be established.
   When the PM Initiator wants to start the measurement process, it
   enables the measurement capabilities to the PM Responder by sending
   ACT packet to the specific UDP port on the PM Responder.  When the PM
   Responder receives the ACT, it enables its measurement function and
   responses to the Sender with ACT-ACK packet.  The connection
   activation process is finished after the PM Initiator receiving the

   ACT-ACK packet from the PM Responder, then the PM Initiator can send
   FM packet after one cycle.  The definition of flow, FlowID, and the
   sending period of FM packets must be consulted by two ends during the
   connection activation process.

   The format of ACT packet is defined as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3

   Ver and Type existed in all packets in this memo indicate the version
   and type of packet.  Type in this packets MUST be 0X1 indicates that
   this is an ACT packet.

   Periods defined by PM Initiator indicates the sending period of FM
   packets.

   FlowType indicates how a flow is defined.0x0 in this filed is for
   (SIP, DIP, PT, sPort, dPort), while 0x1 is for (SIP, DIP, PT, DSCP)
   and 0x2 is for (SIP, DIP, PT).  The other values are not defined.

   PT is the protocol type value of the service flow needed to be
   measured.  It may be UDP, TCP, SCTP or other types.

   SIP is the source IP address of the service flow, and DIP is the
   destination IP address of the service flow.  SPort and DPort which
   are valid only when the flow is defined by (SIP, DIP, PT, sPort,
   dPort) indicate source/destination port number of the ACT packets.
   If the FlowType is not defined by (SIP, DIP, PT, sPort, dPort), this
   filed is 0xFF.

   sFlowId is the flow id defined by the PM Initiator.

   DSCP is valid only when the flow is defined by (SIP, DIP, PT, DSCP).
   It indicates the value of the DSCP filed in IP header of service
   flow.

   dFlowId is copied from the sFlowId field of the ACT packets.

   sFlowId is the flow id defined by the PM Responder.

4.2.  Measurement Process

   When the connection is established successfully, the PM Initiator
   sends FM packets according to the given time-interval, and the PM
   Responder responses by sending BR packets after receiving FM packets
   from the PM Initiator.  The destination port number in the FM packet
   header must be set as the specific number.

   The format of FM packet is defined as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3

   different FM packets and indicates the correspondence between FM
   packets and BR packets.  Each PM flow should maintain a set of
   sequence numbers (SN).

   dFlowId is the flow id of the PM Responder, which is copied from
   sFlowId in ACT-ACK.

   FwdTxPkt is the accumulation of the number of the packets sent by the
   PM Initiator.  FwdTxByte is the accumulation of the number of bytes
   sent by the PM Initiator.In order to determine the value of the
   fields of FwdTxPkt and FwdTxByte, the PM Initiator maintains two
   counters, SPN and SBN, for each PM flow that is incremented every
   time a traffic packet is sent.When the FM packets are to be sent, the
   FwdTxPkt and FwdTxByte are set to the then value of the counters
   respectively.

   T1 is the timestamp when the PM Initiator sends FM packets.  There is
   no requirement for synchronization between the PM Initiator and the
   PM Responder.

   The format of BR packet is defined as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3

   dFlowId is the flow id of the PM Initiator, which is copied from
   sFlowId in ACT.

   The FwdTxPkt and FwdTxByte are copied from the corresponding FM
   packet.  FwdRxPkt is the accumulation of the number of the packets
   received by the PM Responder.  FwdRxByte is the accumulation of the
   number of bytes received by the PM Responder.  In order to determine
   the value of the fields of FwdRxPkt and FwdRxByte, the PM Responder
   maintains two counters, RPN and RBN, for each PM flow that is
   incremented every time a traffic packet is received.  When the BR
   packets are to be sent, the FwdRxPkt and FwdRxByte are set to the
   then value of the counters respectively.

   T1 is copied from the T1 field of the FM packets, T2 is the timestamp
   when the PM Responder receives the FM packets, and T3 is the
   timestamp when the PM Responder sends the BR packets.

   When the PM Responder receives a FM packet, it copies the value of
   FwdTxPkt, FwdTxByte and T1 in FM packet into the corresponding fields
   of the BR packet, and sets the fields of T3, FwdRxPkt and FwdRxByte
   and sends the BR packet.

   Note that the PM Initiator could start multiple measurement engines;
   each engine is corresponding to an active logical path (with a
   different Flow).  These measurement engines operate in parallel, and
   send FM packets with the flow id of the logical path, collect the
   corresponding BR packets, and maintain the collected statistical
   values.

4.3.  Connection Deactivation

   When the PM Initiator wants to stop the measurement, it sends
   Connection Deactivation request packet called DEA to the PM
   Responder.  The PM Responder sends DEA-ACK packets back to the PM
   Initiator after it receives the DEA packets.

   The format of DEA packet is defined as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3

5.  Statistics

5.1.  Delay Calculation

   In order to determine the delay sample for a given FM and BR packets,
   we assume that the paths are symmetric; that is the delay would be
   same for FM and BR packets.  Therefore, the traffic delay is
   calculated as:

                                 (T4-T1)-(T3-T2)
                            Td = ---------------
                                        2


   Where td is the one-way delay for the dth BR received, t4 is the time
   that the PM Initiator received the dth BR packet, t3 is the time that
   the PM Initiator sent the dth FM packet. t2 is the time that the PM
   Responder received dth FM packet, and t1 is the time that PM
   Responder sent the dth BR packet(dth is a SN of a flow).

   Let's assume that during the current reporting interval D, N BR
   packets were received at the PM Initiator, the delay reported to the
   network management entity is determined as

                                  1    M+N-1
                            TD = --- *  sum  td
                                  N     d=M


   Where TD is the delay metric reported corresponding to the interval D
   to the network management entity.

5.2.  Jitter Calculation

   Jitter is defined as the Packet Delay Variation, and is not
   calculated for each arriving BR packet.  Instead, td values are
   considered over several seconds, and the associated jitter value is
   calculated.  Let's consider that N consecutive delay values were used
   to determine the dth jitter value, jp as:


                              ________________________
                             | 1    M+N-1           2
                      jp =   |--- * sum  ( TD - Td )
                           /\| N    d=M

                      jp is the variance of delay


   Note that hence calculated jitter value needs to be aggregated over
   the reporting interval.  Let's assume that during the current
   reporting interval D, N such jitter calculations were made at the PM
   Initiator, therefore the jitter reported to the network management
   entity is determined as:

                                   1      N
                             jD = --- *  sum jp
                                   N     p=1


5.3.  Loss Calculation

   When the dth BR packet is received at the PM Initiator, the loss rate
   plr based on the dth BR packet and (d-1)th BR packet is calculated
   as:

                        (SPN(d)-SPN(d-1))-(RPN(d)-RPN(d-1))
                plrd = -------------------------------------
                                SPN(d)-SPN(d-1)


   (SPN(d)-SPN(d-1))indicates the number of service packets sent by the
   PM Initiator during dth measurement, and (RPN(d)-RPN(d-1)) indicates
   the actual number of service packets received by the PM Responder
   during dth measurement.

   The loss rate needs to be aggregated over the reporting interval.
   Let's assume that N BR packets were received during the dth reporting
   interval.  Therefore, the packet loss rate for that interval can be
   calculated as:

Internet-Draft     Flow-based Performance Measurement          June 2012


                                   1      N
                           PLRd = --- *  sum plrd
                                   N     d=1



6.  Exception Handling

6.1.  FM/BR Packet Loss

   In some cases the FM or BR packet may be lost in transit, then no
   statistics can be obtained from this round of measurement.  So the
   loss rate of the mth measurement can be calculated as:

                         (SPN(m)-SPN(n))-(RPN(m)-RPN(d-n))
                plrm = -------------------------------------
                                   SPN(m)-SPN(n)


   where m is the SN of the BR packet currently received and n is the SN
   of the latest BR received.

6.2.  Packet Mis-ordering

   In the receive side if the received packets are out of order, the FM
   packet may arrive earlier than the last service packet sent before
   it, or later than the first service packet sent after it.  Then
   statistical error of packet loss will be result in.  Note that the
   packet loss calculation is based on sample statistic, so the
   occasional packet mis-ordering may make less impact on the packet
   loss statistic.  And the mis-ordering can be solved by some private
   method which is out-of-scope of this document.


7.  Use Case

   This section describes a typical scene using the measurement method.
   The wireless mobile backhaul networks based on IP, share the
   available capacity between the connected eNodeBs.  Compared to the
   traditional SDH/ATM transport network, in IP-RAN, the data transfer
   speed is unstable and data transfer is lacks of QoS guarantee and
   there is no perfect testing method on packet loss, delay and jitter.
   So it is necessary for the nodes in the RAN side to detect the
   network quality of the connection between RNC and NodeB or eNodeB and
   SAE.

   Take the eNodeB and SAE for example; in order to make sure that the
   amount of generated traffic is aligned with the available capacity,



Sun, et al.             Expires December 31, 2012              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft     Flow-based Performance Measurement          June 2012


   it is important that the eNodeB probes the backhaul network to
   determine the actual delay, jitter and packet loss encountered by
   typical packets.  The proposed method in this document can be used to
   detect the IP Performance of the connections between the eNB and
   S-GW.

   At the eNodeB, FM OAM packets are generated periodically with the
   source and destination IP addresses, and DSCP class.  At the S-GW,
   after receiving the FM packets, BR packets are constructed.  They are
   then forwarded back to the eNodeB.  Upon receiving the BR packets at
   the logical port exactly knows the current congestion extent in
   transport network.  The bandwidth of the logical port is reduced if
   congestion is detected according to the measurement result;
   otherwise, the bandwidth is increased slowly.


8.  Security Considerations

   To be defined.


9.  IANA Considerations

   The destination port number of the newly defined packets for
   measurement needs to be assigned by the IANA.
