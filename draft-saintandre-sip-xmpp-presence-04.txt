Internet-Draft       SIP-XMPP Interworking: Presence       February 2013


1.  Introduction

   In order to help ensure interworking between presence systems that
   conform to the instant message / presence requirements [RFC2779], it
   is important to clearly define protocol mappings between such
   systems.  Within the IETF, work has proceeded on two presence
   technologies:

   o  Various extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol ([RFC3261])
      for instant messaging, as developed within the SIP for Instant
      Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE) Working
      Group; the relevant specification for presence is [RFC3856]

   o  The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), which
      consists of a formalization of the core XML streaming protocols
      developed originally by the Jabber open-source community; the
      relevant specifications are [RFC6120] for the XML streaming layer
      and [RFC6121] for basic presence and instant messaging extensions

   One approach to helping ensure interworking between these protocols
   is to map each protocol to the abstract semantics described in
   [RFC3860]; that is the approach taken by
   [I-D.ietf-simple-cpim-mapping] and [RFC3922].  The approach taken in
   this document is to directly map semantics from one protocol to
   another (i.e., from SIP/SIMPLE to XMPP and vice-versa).

   The architectural assumptions underlying such direct mappings are
   provided in [I-D.saintandre-sip-xmpp-core], including mapping of
   addresses and error condisions.  The mappings specified in this
   document cover basic presence functionality.  Mapping of more
   advanced functionality is out of scope for this document, but other
   documents in this series cover such topics.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

4.  Presence Subscriptions

4.1.  Overview

   Both XMPP and presence-aware SIP systems enable entities (often but
   not necessarily human users) to subscribe to the presence of other
   entities.  XMPP presence subscriptions are specified in [RFC6121].
   Presence subscriptions using a SIP event package for presence are
   specified in [RFC3856].

   As described in [RFC6121], XMPP presence subscriptions are managed
   using XMPP presence stanzas of type "subscribe", "subscribed",
   "unsubscribe", and "unsubscribed".  The main subscription states are
   "none" (neither the user nor the contact is subscribed to the other's
   presence information), "from" (the user has a subscription from the
   contact), "to" (the user has a subscription to the contact's presence
   information), and "both" (both user and contact are subscribed to
   each other's presence information).

   As described in [RFC3856], SIP presence subscriptions are managed
   through the use of SIP SUBSCRIBE events sent from a SIP user agent to
   an intended recipient who is most generally referenced by an Instant
   Message URI of the form <pres:user@domain> but who may be referenced
   by a SIP or SIPS URI of the form <sip:user@domain> or
   <sips:user@domain>.

   The subscription models underlying XMPP and SIP are quite different.
   For instance, XMPP presence subscriptions are long-lived (indeed
   permanent if not explicitly cancelled), whereas SIP presence
   subscriptions are short-lived (the default time to live of a SIP
   presence subscription is 3600 seconds, as specified in Section 6.4 of
   [RFC3856]).  These differences are addressed below.

4.2.  XMPP to SIP

4.2.1.  Establishing

   An XMPP user initiates a subscription by sending a subscription
   request to another entity (conventionally called a "contact"), which
   request the contact either accepts or declines.  If the contact
   accepts the request, the user will have a subscription to the
   contact's presence information until (1) the user unsubscribes or (2)
   the contact cancels the subscription.  The subscription request is
   encapsulated in a presence stanza of type "subscribe":







Saint-Andre, et al.      Expires August 9, 2013                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       SIP-XMPP Interworking: Presence       February 2013


   Example: XMPP user subscribes to SIP contact:

   |  <presence from='juliet@example.com'
   |            to='romeo@example.net'
   |            type='subscribe'/>

   Upon receiving such a stanza, the XMPP server to which Juliet has
   connected needs to determine the identity of the foreign domain,
   which it does by performing one or more DNS SRV lookups [RFC2782].
   For presence stanzas, the order of lookups recommended by [RFC6121]
   is to first try the "_xmpp-server" service as specified in [RFC6120]
   and to then try the "_pres" service as specified in [RFC3861].  Here
   we assume that the first lookup will fail but that the second lookup
   will succeed and return a resolution "_pres._simple.example.net.",
   since we have already assumed that the example.net hostname is
   running a SIP presence service.

   Once the XMPP server has determined that the foreign domain is
   serviced by a SIMPLE server, it must determine how to proceed.  We
   here assume that the XMPP server contains or has available to it an
   XMPP-SIMPLE gateway.  The XMPP server would then deliver the presence
   stanza to the XMPP-SIMPLE gateway.

   The XMPP-SIMPLE gateway is then responsible for translating the XMPP
   subscription request into a SIP SUBSCRIBE request from the XMPP user
   to the SIP user:

   Example: XMPP user subscribes to SIP contact (SIP transformation):

   |  SUBSCRIBE sip:romeo@example.net SIP/2.0
   |  Via: SIP/2.0/TCP x2s.example.com;branch=z9hG4bKna998sk
   |  From: <sip:juliet@example.com>;tag=ffd2
   |  To: <sip:romeo@example.net>
   |  Call-ID: l04th3s1p@example.com
   |  Event: presence
   |  Max-Forwards: 70
   |  CSeq: 123 SUBSCRIBE
   |  Contact: <sip:sipgate.example.com;transport=tcp>
   |  Accept: application/pidf+xml
   |  Expires: 3600
   |  Content-Length: 0

   The SIP user then SHOULD send a response indicating acceptance of the
   subscription request:

Internet-Draft       SIP-XMPP Interworking: Presence       February 2013


   Example: SIP accepts subscription request:

   |  SIP/2.0 200 OK
   |  Via: SIP/2.0/TCP s2x.example.net;branch=z9hG4bKna998sk
   |  From: <sip:romeo@example.net>;tag=ffd2
   |  To: <sip:juliet@example.com>;tag=j89d
   |  Call-ID: l04th3s1p@example.com
   |  CSeq: 234 SUBSCRIBE
   |  Contact: <sip:simple.example.net;transport=tcp>
   |  Expires: 3600
   |  Content-Length: 0

   In accordance with [RFC6665], the XMPP-SIMPLE gateway should consider
   the subscription state to be "neutral" until it receives a NOTIFY
   message.  Therefore the SIP user or SIP-XMPP gateway at the SIP
   user's domain SHOULD immediately send a NOTIFY message containing a
   "Subscription-State" header whose value contains the string "active"
   (see Section 5).

   Example: SIP user sends presence notification:

   |  NOTIFY sip:192.0.2.1 SIP/2.0
   |  Via: SIP/2.0/TCP simple.example.net;branch=z9hG4bKna998sk
   |  From: <sip:romeo@example.net>;tag=yt66
   |  To: <sip:juliet@example.com>;tag=bi54
   |  Call-ID: l04th3s1p@example.com
   |  Event: presence
   |  Subscription-State: active;expires=499
   |  Max-Forwards: 70
   |  CSeq: 8775 NOTIFY
   |  Contact: <sip:simple.example.net;transport=tcp>
   |  Content-Type: application/pidf+xml
   |  Content-Length: 193
   |
   |  <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
   |  <presence xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf'
   |            entity='pres:romeo@example.net'>
   |    <tuple id='ID-orchard'>
   |      <status>
   |        <basic>open</basic>
   |        <show xmlns='jabber:client'>away</show>
   |      </status>
   |    </tuple>
   |  </presence>

   Upon receiving the first NOTIFY with a subscription state of active,
   the XMPP-SIMPLE gateway MUST generate a presence stanza of type
   "subscribed":

Internet-Draft       SIP-XMPP Interworking: Presence       February 2013


   Example: XMPP user receives acknowledgement from SIP contact:

   |  <presence from='romeo@example.net'
   |            to='juliet@example.com'
   |            type='subscribed'/>

   As described under Section 5, the gateway MUST also generate a
   presence notification to the XMPP user:

   Example: XMPP user receives presence notification from SIP contact:

   |  <presence from='romeo@example.net/orchard'
   |            to='juliet@example.com'/>

4.2.2.  Refreshing

   It is the responsibility of the XMPP-SIMPLE gateway to set the value
   of the "Expires" header and to periodically renew the subscription on
   the SIMPLE side of the gateway so that the subscription appears to be
   permanent to the XMPP user (e.g., the XMPP-SIMPLE gateway SHOULD send
   a new SUBSCRIBE request to the SIP user whenever the XMPP user sends
   initial presence to its XMPP server, i.e., upon initiating a presence
   session with the XMPP server).  See the Security Considerations
   (Section 7) of this document for important information and
   requirements regarding the security implications of this
   functionality.

4.2.3.  Cancelling

   At any time after subscribing, the XMPP user may unsubscribe from the
   contact's presence.  This is done by sending a presence stanza of
   type "unsubscribe":

   Example: XMPP user unsubscribes from SIP contact:

   |  <presence from='juliet@example.com'
   |            to='romeo@example.net'
   |            type='unsubscribe'/>

   The XMPP-SIMPLE gateway is responsible for translating the
   unsubscribe command into a SIP SUBSCRIBE request with the "Expires"
   header set to a value of zero:

Internet-Draft       SIP-XMPP Interworking: Presence       February 2013


   Example: XMPP user unsubscribes from SIP contact (SIP
   transformation):

   |  SUBSCRIBE sip:romeo@example.net SIP/2.0
   |  Via: SIP/2.0/TCP s2x.example.net;branch=z9hG4bKna998sk
   |  From: <sip:juliet@example.com>;tag=j89d
   |  To: <sip:romeo@example.net>;tag=xfg9
   |  Call-ID: 1ckm32@example.com
   |  Event: presence
   |  Max-Forwards: 70
   |  CSeq: 789 SUBSCRIBE
   |  Contact: <sip:x2s.example.com;transport=tcp>
   |  Accept: application/pidf+xml
   |  Expires: 0
   |  Content-Length: 0

   Upon sending the transformed unsubscribe, the XMPP-SIMPLE gateway
   SHOULD a presence stanza of type "unsubscribed" to the XMPP user:

   Example: XMPP user receives unsubscribed notification:

   |  <presence from='romeo@example.net'
   |            to='juliet@example.com'
   |            type='unsubscribed'/>

4.3.  SIP to XMPP

4.3.1.  Establishing

   A SIP user initiates a subscription to a contact's presence
   information by sending a SIP SUBSCRIBE request to the contact.  The
   following is an example of such a request:

   Example: SIP user subscribes to XMPP contact:

   |  SUBSCRIBE sip:juliet@example.com SIP/2.0
   |  Via: SIP/2.0/TCP s2x.example.net;branch=z9hG4bKna998sk
   |  From: <sip:romeo@example.net>;tag=xfg9
   |  To: <sip:juliet@example.com>;tag=ur93
   |  Call-ID: 4wcm0n@example.net
   |  Event: presence
   |  Max-Forwards: 70
   |  CSeq: 263 SUBSCRIBE
   |  Contact: <sip:simple.example.net;transport=tcp>
   |  Accept: application/pidf+xml
   |  Content-Length: 0

   Notice that the "Expires" header was not included in the SUBSCRIBE

   request; this means that the default value of 3600 (i.e., 3600
   seconds = 1 hour) applies.

   Upon receiving such a request, a SIMPLE-XMPP gateway is responsible
   for translating it into an XMPP subscription request from the SIP
   user to the XMPP user:

   Example: SIP user subscribes to XMPP contact (XMPP transformation):

   |  <presence from='romeo@example.net'
   |            to='juliet@example.com'
   |            type='subscribe'/>

   In accordance with [RFC6121], the XMPP user's server MUST deliver the
   presence subscription request to the XMPP user (or, if a subscription
   already exists in the XMPP user's roster, discard the subscribe
   request).  If the XMPP user approves the subscription request, the
   XMPP server then MUST return a presence stanza of type "subscribed"
   from the XMPP user to the SIP user; if a subscription already exists,
   the XMPP server SHOULD auto-reply with a presence stanza of type
   "subscribed".  In any case, if the SIMPLE-XMPP gateway receives a
   presence stanza of type "subscribed" from the XMPP user, it SHOULD
   silently discard the stanza.

4.3.2.  Refreshing

   It is the responsibility of the SIMPLE-XMPP gateway to properly
   handle the difference between short-lived SIP presence subscriptions
   and long-lived XMPP presence subscriptions.  The gateway has two
   options when the SIP user's subscription expires:

   o  Cancel the subscription (i.e., treat it as temporary) and send an
      XMPP presence stanza of type "unsubscribe" to the XMPP contact;
      this honors the SIP semantic but will seem rather odd to the XMPP
      contact.
   o  Maintain the subscription (i.e., treat it as long-lived) and (1)
      send a SIP NOTIFY request to the SIP user containing a PIDF
      document specifying that the XMPP contact now has a basic status
      of "closed", including a Subscription-State of "terminated" and
      (2) send an XMPP presence stanza of type "unavailable" to the XMPP
      contact; this violates the letter of the SIP semantic but will
      seem more natural to the XMPP contact.

   Which of these options the SIMPLE-XMPP gateway chooses is up to the
   implementation.

   If the implementation chooses the first option, the protocol
   generated would be as follows:

Internet-Draft       SIP-XMPP Interworking: Presence       February 2013


   Example: SIP subscription expires (treated as temporary by gateway):

   |  <presence from='romeo@example.net'
   |            to='juliet@example.com'
   |            type='unsubscribe'/>

   If the implementation chooses the second option, the protocol
   generated would be as follows:

   Example: SIP subscription expires (treated as long-lived by gateway):

   |  NOTIFY sip:192.0.2.2 SIP/2.0
   |  Via: SIP/2.0/TCP s2x.example.net;branch=z9hG4bKna998sk
   |  From: <sip:juliet@example.com>;tag=ur93
   |  To: <sip:romeo@example.net>;tag=pq72
   |  Call-ID: j4s0h4vny@example.com
   |  Event: presence
   |  Subscription-State: terminated;reason=timeout
   |  Max-Forwards: 70
   |  CSeq: 232 NOTIFY
   |  Contact: <sip:sipgate.example.com;transport=tcp>
   |  Content-Type: application/pidf+xml
   |  Content-Length: 194
   |
   |  <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
   |  <presence xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf'
   |            entity='pres:juliet@example.com'>
   |    <tuple id='ID-balcony'>
   |      <status>
   |        <basic>closed</basic>
   |      </status>
   |    </tuple>
   |  </presence>

   Example: SIP subscription expires (treated as long-lived by gateway):

   |  <presence from='romeo@example.net'
   |            to='juliet@example.com'
   |            type='unavailable'/>

4.3.3.  Cancelling

   At any time, the SIP user may cancel the subscription by sending a
   SUBSCRIBE message whose "Expires" header is set to a value of zero
   ("0"):

Internet-Draft       SIP-XMPP Interworking: Presence       February 2013


   Example: SIP user cancels subscription:

   |  SUBSCRIBE sip:192.0.2.1 SIP/2.0
   |  Via: SIP/2.0/TCP simple.example.net;branch=z9hG4bKna998sk
   |  From: <sip:romeo@example.net>;tag=yt66
   |  To: <sip:juliet@example.com>;tag=bi54
   |  Call-ID: 1tsn1ce@example.net
   |  Event: presence
   |  Max-Forwards: 70
   |  CSeq: 8775 SUBSCRIBE
   |  Contact: <sip:simple.example.net;transport=tcp>
   |  Expires: 0
   |  Content-Length: 0

   As above, upon receiving such a request, a SIMPLE-XMPP gateway is
   responsible for doing one of the following:

   o  Cancel the subscription (i.e., treat it as temporary) and send an
      XMPP presence stanza of type "unsubscribe" to the XMPP contact.
   o  Maintain the subscription (i.e., treat it as long-lived) and (1)
      send a SIP NOTIFY request to the SIP user containing a PIDF
      document specifying that the XMPP contact now has a basic status
      of "closed", (2) send a SIP SUBSCRIBE request to the SIP user with
      an "Expires" header set to a value of "0" (zero) when it receives
      XMPP presence of type "unavailable" from the XMPP contact, and (3)
      send an XMPP presence stanza of type "unavailable" to the XMPP
      contact.


5.  Presence Notifications

5.1.  Overview

   Both XMPP and presence-aware SIP systems enable entities (often but
   not necessarily human users) to send presence notifications to other
   entities.  At a minimum, the term "presence" refers to information
   about an entity's availability for communication on a network (on/
   off), often supplemented by information that further specifies the
   entity's communications context (e.g., "do not disturb").  Some
   systems and protocols extend this notion even further and refer to
   any relatively ephemeral information about an entity as a kind of
   presence; categories of such "extended presence" include geographical
   location (e.g., GPS coordinates), user mood (e.g., grumpy), user
   activity (e.g., walking), and ambient environment (e.g., noisy).  In
   this document, we focus on the "least common denominator" of network
   availability only, although future documents may address broader
   notions of presence, including extended presence.

Internet-Draft       SIP-XMPP Interworking: Presence       February 2013


   [RFC6121] defines how XMPP presence stanzas can indicate availability
   (via absence of a 'type' attribute) or lack of availability (via a
   'type' attribute with a value of "unavailable").  SIP presence using
   a SIP event package for presence is specified in [RFC3856].

   As described in [RFC6121], presence information about an entity is
   communicated by means of an XML <presence/> stanza sent over an XML
   stream.  In this document we will assume that such a presence stanza
   is sent from an XMPP client to an XMPP server over an XML stream
   negotiated between the client and the server, and that the client is
   controlled by a human user (again, this is a simplifying assumption
   introduced for explanatory purposes only).  In general, XMPP presence
   is sent by the user to the user's server and then broadcasted to all
   entities who are subscribed to the user's presence information.

   As described in [RFC3856], presence information about an entity is
   communicated by means of a SIP NOTIFY event sent from a SIP user
   agent to an intended recipient who is most generally referenced by an
   Instant Message URI of the form <pres:user@domain> but who may be
   referenced by a SIP or SIPS URI of the form <sip:user@domain> or
   <sips:user@domain>.  Here again we introduce the simplifying
   assumption that the user agent is controlled by a human user.

   This document addresses basic presence or network availability only,
   not the various extensions to SIP and XMPP for "rich presence", such
   as [RFC4480], [XEP-0107], and [XEP-0108].

5.2.  XMPP to SIP

   When Juliet interacts with her XMPP client to modify her presence
   information (or when her client automatically updates her presence
   information, e.g. via an "auto-away" feature), her client generates
   an XMPP <presence/> stanza.  The syntax of the <presence/> stanza,
   including required and optional elements and attributes, is defined
   in [RFC6121].  The following is an example of such a stanza:

   Example: XMPP user sends presence notification:

   |  <presence from='juliet@example.com/balcony'/>

   Upon receiving such a stanza, the XMPP server to which Juliet has
   connected broadcasts it to all subscribers who are authorized to
   receive presence notifications from Juliet (this is similar to the
   SIP NOTIFY method).  For each subscriber, broadcasting the presence
   notification involves either delivering it to a local recipient (if
   the hostname in the subscriber's address matches one of the hostnames
   serviced by the XMPP server) or attempting to route it to the foreign
   domain that services the hostname in the subscriber's address.

Internet-Draft       SIP-XMPP Interworking: Presence       February 2013


   Naturally, in this document we assume that the hostname is a SIP
   presence service hosted by a separate server.  As specified in
   [RFC6121], the XMPP server needs to determine the identity of the
   foreign domain, which it does by performing one or more DNS SRV
   lookups [RFC2782].  For presence stanzas, the order of lookups
   recommended by [RFC6121] is to first try the "_xmpp-server" service
   as specified in [RFC6120] and to then try the "_pres" service as
   specified in [RFC3861].  Here we assume that the first lookup will
   fail but that the second lookup will succeed and return a resolution
   "_pres._simple.example.net.", since we have already assumed that the
   example.net hostname is running a SIP presence service.  (Note: The
   XMPP server may have previously determined that the foreign domain is
   a SIMPLE server, e.g., when it sent a SIP SUBSCRIBE to the SIP user
   when Juliet sent initial presence to the XMPP server, in which case
   it would not need to perform the SRV lookups; the caching of such
   information is a matter of implementation and local service policy,
   and is therefore out of scope for this document.)

   Once the XMPP server has determined that the foreign domain is
   serviced by a SIMPLE server, it must determine how to proceed.  We
   here assume that the XMPP server contains or has available to it an
   XMPP-SIMPLE gateway.  The XMPP server would then deliver the presence
   stanza to the XMPP-SIMPLE gateway.

   The XMPP-SIMPLE gateway is then responsible for translating the XMPP
   presence stanza into a SIP NOTIFY request and included PIDF document
   from the XMPP user to the SIP user.

      +-----------------------------+---------------------------+

   Note the following regarding these mappings:

   1.  Only a presence stanza that lacks a 'type' attribute or whose
       'type' attribute has a value of "unavailable" should be mapped by
       an XMPP-SIMPLE gateway to a SIP NOTIFY request, since those are
       the only presence stanzas that represent notifications.
   2.  The PIDF schema defines the tuple 'id' attribute as having a
       datatype of "xs:ID"; because this datatype is more restrictive
       than the "xs:string" datatype for XMPP resourceparts (in
       particular, a number is not allowed as the first character of an
       ID), it is RECOMMENDED to prepend the resourcepart with "ID-" or
       some other alphabetic string when mapping from XMPP to SIP.
   3.  Because the lack of a 'type' attribute indicates that an XMPP
       entity is available for communications, the gateway SHOULD map
       that information to a PIDF <basic/> status of "open".  Because a
       'type' attribute with a value of "unavailable" indicates that an
       XMPP entity is not available for communications, the gateway
       SHOULD map that information to a PIDF <basic/> status of
       "closed".
   4.  When the XMPP-SIMPLE gateway receives XMPP presence of type
       "unavailable" from the XMPP contact, it SHOULD (1) send a SIP
       NOTIFY request to the SIP user containing a PIDF document
       specifying that the XMPP contact now has a basic status of
       "closed" and (2) send a SIP SUBSCRIBE request to the SIP user
       with an "Expires" header set to a value of "0" (zero).
   5.  Some implementations support custom extensions to encapsulate
       this information; however, there is no need to standardize a PIDF
       extension for this purpose, since PIDF is already extensible and
       thus the <show/> element can be included directly, qualified by
       the 'jabber:client' namespace in the PIDF XML.  The examples in
       this document illustrate this usage.
   6.  The XML character data of the XMPP <status/> element MAY be
       mapped to the character data of the PIDF <note/> element.

5.3.  SIP to XMPP

   When Romeo changes his presence, his SIP user agent generates a SIP
   NOTIFY request for any active subscriptions.  The syntax of the
   NOTIFY request is defined in [RFC3856].  The following is an example
   of such a request:

Internet-Draft       SIP-XMPP Interworking: Presence       February 2013


   Example: SIP user sends presence notification:

   |  NOTIFY sip:192.0.2.1 SIP/2.0
   |  Via: SIP/2.0/TCP simple.example.net;branch=z9hG4bKna998sk
   |  From: <sip:romeo@example.net>;tag=yt66
   |  To: <sip:juliet@example.com>;tag=bi54
   |  Call-ID: j0sj4sv1m@example.net
   |  Event: presence
   |  Subscription-State: active;expires=499
   |  Max-Forwards: 70
   |  CSeq: 8775 NOTIFY
   |  Contact: <sip:simple.example.net;transport=tcp>
   |  Content-Type: application/pidf+xml
   |  Content-Length: 193
   |
   |  <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
   |  <presence xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf'
   |            entity='pres:romeo@example.net'>
   |    <tuple id='orchard'>
   |      <status>
   |        <basic>closed</basic>
   |      </status>
   |    </tuple>
   |  </presence>

   Upon receiving such a request, a SIMPLE-XMPP gateway is responsible
   for translating it into an XMPP presence stanza from the SIP user to
   the XMPP user:

   Example: SIP user sends presence notification (XMPP transformation):

   |  <presence from='romeo@example.net'
   |            to='juliet@example.com/balcony'
   |            type='unavailable'/>

   The mapping of SIP syntax elements to XMPP syntax elements SHOULD be
   as shown in the following table.  (Mappings for elements not
   mentioned are undefined.)

      |  priority for tuple       |  <priority/>                |

      |  body of MESSAGE          |  <body/>                    |
      +---------------------------+-----------------------------+

   Note the following regarding these mappings:

   1.  A PIDF basic status of "open" SHOULD be mapped to no 'type'
       attribute, and a PIDF basic status of "closed" SHOULD be mapped
       to a 'type' attribute whose value is "unavailable".


6.  Content Types

   SIP requests of type NOTIFY normally contain presence information
   encapsulated using the "application/pidf+xml" content type.  The
   recommended procedures for SIMPLE-to-XMPP gateways to use in handling
   these content types are as follows.

   The "application/pidf+xml' content type is specified in [RFC3863].
   The Presence Information Data Format defines a common data format for
   presence protocols that conform to the Common Profile for Presence
   ([RFC3859]), enabling presence information to be transferred across
   CPP-compliant protocol boundaries without modification, with
   attendant benefits for end-to-end encryption and performance.
   Because the syntax for the "application/pidf+xml" content type is
   Extensible Markup Language ([XML]), it is straightforward to send
   PIDF data over the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)
   ([RFC6120]), since XMPP is simply an XML streaming protocol.

   In addition to following the syntax mappings specified in Section 5,
   a SIMPLE-to-XMPP gateway MAY encapsulate PIDF data within an
   "extended namespace" contained in an XMPP presence stanza.  The
   RECOMMENDED method is to include the PIDF <presence/> element as a
   child of the XMPP <presence/> stanza.  Although it may appear that
   this would be potentially confusing, the inclusion of the
   'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf' namespace ensures that PIDF data is
   kept separate from XMPP presence data (in accordance with
   [XML-NAMES]).  The following is a simple example of encapsulating



Saint-Andre, et al.      Expires August 9, 2013                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft       SIP-XMPP Interworking: Presence       February 2013


   PIDF data within an "extended namespace" in XMPP:

   A basic example of PIDF over XMPP:

   <presence from='romeo@example.net/orchard'
             to='nurse@example.com'
             xml:lang='en'>
     <status>Wooing Juliet</status>
     <presence xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf'
               entity='pres:romeo@example.net'>
       <tuple id='orchard'>
         <status>
           <basic>open</basic>
           <show xmlns='jabber:client'>dnd</show>
           <note>Wooing Juliet</note>
         </status>
       </tuple>
     </presence>
   </presence>


7.  Security Considerations

   Detailed security considerations for presence protocols are given in
   [RFC2779], for SIP-based presence in [RFC3856] (see also [RFC3261]),
   and for XMPP-based presence in [RFC6121] (see also [RFC6120]).

   The mismatch between long-lived XMPP presence subscriptions and
   short-lived SIP presence subscriptions introduces the possibility of
   an amplification attack launched from the XMPP network against a SIP
   presence server.  To help prevent such an attack, access to an XMPP-
   SIMPLE gateway that is hosted on the XMPP network SHOULD be
   restricted to XMPP users associated with a single domain or trust
   realm (e.g., a gateway hosted at simple.example.com should allow only
   users within the example.com domain to access the gateway, not users
   within example.org, example.net, or any other domain); if a SIP
   presence server receives communications through an XMPP-SIMPLE
   gateway from users who are not associated with a domain that is so
   related to the hostname of the gateway, it MAY (based on local
   service provisioning) refuse to service such users or refuse to
   communicate with the gateway.  Furthermore, whenever an XMPP-SIMPLE
   gateway seeks to refresh an XMPP user's long-lived subscription to a
   SIP user's presence, it MUST first send an XMPP <presence/> stanza of
   type "probe" from the address of the gateway to the "bare JID"
   (user@domain.tld) of the XMPP user, to which the user's XMPP server
   MUST respond in accordance with [RFC6121]; however, the administrator
   of an XMPP-SIMPLE gateway MAY (based on local service provisioning)
   exempt "known good" XMPP servers from this check (e.g., the XMPP
