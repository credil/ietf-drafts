1.  Introduction

   This specification defines the JSON merge patch document format,
   processing rules, and associated MIME media type identifier.  The
   merge patch format is primarily intended for use with the HTTP PATCH
   method [RFC5789] as a means of describing a set of modifications to a
   subset of target resource's content.

   A JSON merge patch document describes changes to be made to a target
   JSON document using a syntax that closely mimics the document being
   modified.  Recipients of a merge patch document determine the exact
   set of changes being requested by comparing the content of the
   provided patch against the current content of the target document.
   If the provided merge patch contains members that do not appear
   within the target, those members are added.  If the target does
   contain the member, the value is replaced.  Null values in the merge
   patch are given special meaning to indicate the removal of existing
   values in the target.

   For example, given the following original JSON document:

   {
     "a": "b",
     "c": {
       "d": "e",
       "f": "g"
     }
   }

   Changing the value of "a" and removing "f" can be achieved by
   sending:

     PATCH /target HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.org
     Content-Type: application/merge-patch+json

     {
       "a":"z",
       "c": {
         "f": null
       }
     }

   When applied to the target resource, the value of the "a" member is
   replaced with "z" and "f" is removed, leaving the remaining content
   untouched.

   This design means that merge patch documents are suitable for
   describing modifications to JSON documents that primarily use objects
   for their structure and do not make use of explicit null values.  The
   merge patch format is not appropriate for all JSON syntaxes.

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Processing Merge Patch Documents

   JSON merge patch documents describe, by example, a set of changes
   that are to be made to a target resource.  Recipients of merge patch
   documents are responsible for comparing the merge patch with the
   current content of the target resource to determine the specific set
   of change operations to be applied to the target.

   The following rules MUST be applied to determine what changes are to
   be made:

   1.  If the roots of either the merge patch or target resource
       documents are JSON Arrays, the target resource is replaced, in
       whole, by the merge patch document.  Any null member contained in
       the merge patch MUST be ignored and treated as if those members
       are undefined.

   2.  If, however, the roots of the merge patch or target resource
       documents are Objects, iterate through each member of merge patch
       object and determine the following:

       *  If an equivalent member in the target resource is currently
          undefined, and the given value in the merge patch is not null,
          the member is added to the target.



Snell                     Expires May 22, 2014                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft           application/merge-patch           November 2013


       *  If the value given by the merge patch is null and the
          equivalent member is defined in the target resource, the
          existing member is removed.

       *  If the value given by the merge patch is either a non-null
          JSON primitive or Array, and the equivalent member is defined
          in the target, the existing value is replaced with the given
          value.  Any null member contained in a provided array MUST be
          ignored and treated as if the member was undefined, even
          within array or object members within the array.

       *  If the value given by the merge patch is a JSON object, and
          the equivalent member is defined in the target resource with a
          JSON primitive or Array value, that existing value is replaced
          in whole by the object provided.  Any null member in arrays or
          objects within the provided data MUST be ignored and treated
          as if the member was undefined.

       *  If the value given by the merge patch is a JSON object, and
          the equivalent member is currently defined in the target
          resource with an Object value, then recursively apply Rule #2
          to the two objects.

       *  Any member currently defined in the target resource that does
          not explicitly appear within the merge patch is to remain
          untouched and unmodified.

   Once the set of intended modifications is derived from the merge
   patch document, the recipient is free to determine the
   appropriateness of the modification based on it's own understanding
   of the target resource.  If the recipient is unable to apply any
   individual modification described by the merge patch document, it
   MUST NOT apply any of the changes and MUST stop processing the
   modification.

   If the merge patch document attempts to remove a member from the
   target resource that does not currently exist, the recipient SHOULD
   NOT consider the request to be in error.  The requested removal
   SHOULD be ignored as the final modified state of the target will
   still accurately reflect the merge documents original intent.

3.  Example

   For example, given the following example JSON document:

   {
     "title": "Goodbye!",
     "author" : {
       "givenName" : "John",
       "familyName" : "Doe"
     },
     "tags":[ "example", "sample" ],
     "content": "This will be unchanged"
   }

   A user-agent wishing to change the value of the "title" member from
   "Goodbye!" to the value "Hello!", add a new "phoneNumber" member,
   remove the "familyName" from the "author" object, and remove the word
   sample from the "tags" Array, would send the following request:

     PATCH /my/resource HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.org
     Content-Type: application/merge-patch+json; charset="UTF-8"

     {
       "title": "Hello!",
       "phoneNumber": "+01-123-456-7890",
       "author": {
         "familyName": null
       },
       "tags": [ "example" ]
     }

   The resulting JSON document would be:

   {
     "title": "Hello!",
     "author" : {
       "givenName" : "John"
     },
     "tags": [ "example" ],
     "content": "This will be unchanged",
     "phoneNumber": "+01-123-456-7890"
   }

4.  IANA Considerations

   This specification registers the following additional MIME Media
   Types:

      Type name: application

      Subtype name: merge-patch+json

      Required parameters: None

      Optional parameters: "charset" : Specifies the character set
      encoding.  If not specified, a default of "UTF-8" is assumed.

      Encoding considerations: Resources that use the "application/
      merge-patch+json" media type are required to conform to the
      "application/json" Media Type and are therefore subject to the
      same encoding considerations specified in Section 6 [RFC4627].

      Security considerations: As defined in this specification

      Published specification: This specification.

      Applications that use this media type: None currently known.

      Additional information:

         Magic number(s): N/A

         File extension(s): N/A

         Macintosh file type code(s): TEXT

      Person & email address to contact for further information: James M

      Intended usage: COMMON

      Restrictions on usage: None.

5.  Security Considerations

   The "application/merge-patch+json" Media Type allows user agents to
   indicate their intention that the server determine the specific set
   of change operations to be applied to a target resource.  As such, it
   is the server's responsibility to determine the appropriateness of
   any given change as well as the user agent's authorization to request
   such changes.  How such determinations are made is considered out of
   the scope of this specification.

   All of the the security considerations discussed in Section 5
   [RFC5789] apply to all uses of the HTTP PATCH method with the
   "application/merge-patch+json" Media Type.
