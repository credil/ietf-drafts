                 p2mp pw protection for mpls-tp network
              draft-liu-pwe3-mpls-tp-p2mp-pw-protection-01

Abstract

   According to one protection Requirement in RFC 5654, Requirement 63
   :It MUST be possible to provide protection for the MPLS-TP data plane
   without any IP forwarding capability in the MPLS-TP data plane. and
   it requires mpls-tp date plane should be independent of its control
   plane. so it is necessary for the 1:1 protection of p2mp pw to have a
   return path to coordinate the switch state between root node and each
   leaf node. for the above problem statement, the document provides a
   solution to protect p2mp pw by using one leaf node as protector for
   another leaf node. so it may avoid setting up a return path for each
   leaf node.


   This document is a product of a joint Internet Task Force(IETF) /

   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as
   defined by the ITU-T.

Internet-Draft   p2mp pw protection for mpls-tp network        June 2012


1.  Problem statement

   according to mpls-tp requirement(RFC 5654), it requires mpls-tp data
   plane is independent of control plane. it means that mpls-tp data
   plane can still work without control plane or under the condition of
   failure on the control plane. at the same time, mpls-tp data plane
   can forward traffic packet without any IP forwarding capability.so it
   must be essential for uni-directional path including p2p or p2mp pw
   to set up a return path between two end nodes in order to communicate
   and associate between the two end nodes. so it needs to set up more
   return paths for p2mp pw, it will need more configuration and
   maintenece cost. so the document provide one protection solution for
   p2mp pw under the condition without return path,IP forwarding
   capability and control plane.

3.  protection solution

   This section will describle the protection solution for p2mp pw in
   detail,which use one leaf node as protector node of another leaf
   node. and the two leaf nodes is backup for each other.in addtion, in
   order to be easy to access to CE node, it should set up backup node
   to directly access to CE node. if backup node is still a leaf node of
   the p2mp pw, protector node and backup node are the same node. at the
   same time, it should set up a bidirectional p2p pw between protected
   node, backup node and protector node .just as the following figure 1:

                                 Figure 1


   LER 0 is the root node of the p2mp pw, LER 1 and LER 3 are leaf nodes
   of the p2mp pw.  LER 2 is backup node for LER 1 and LER 3. when
   protected node LER 1 or LER 3 has the failure, backup node LER 2 will
   replace of protected node LER 1 or LER 3 to transmit traffic packet
   to CE1 or CE3. for CE1 or CE3 node, if it detect a failure on its
   working access link(*), it will select protection access link(+) to
   receive the traffic.for example, just as the following figure 2,.

                                 Figure 2


   if the LER 1 has the failure, CE1 and LER 2 MUST detect the failure
   by OAM or other function. then LER 2 will notify protector node LER 3
   of the failure by pw status message[1]. then LER 3 will begin to
   duplicate the service packet of the p2mp pw to transmit to LER 2 by
   pre-configured p2p protection pw. then the LER 2 send the service
   packet of the p2mp pw to CE1 by protection access link(LER2-CE1).and
   CE1 detects the failure on its working access link(LER1-CE1), it must
   switch to protection access link(LER2-CE1) to receive the service. at
   the same time, if another protected node LER3 has the failure, it may
   use the same method to protect the failure of LER3.

   when there is only the failure on the working access link just as the
   following figure 3:

   when CE1 and LER1 detect a failure on the working access link(LER1-
   CE1), LER1 firstly notify backup node LER2 of the egress AC failure
   by pw status message[1]. then LER1 will send the service packet of
   the p2mp pw to LER2 by protection pw between LER1 and LER2. and LER2
   will transmit the service packet of the p2mp pw to CE1 by protection
   access link(LER2-CE1). at the same time, CE1 will switch to
   protection access link(LER2-CE1) to receive the service packet.

   when the protected node detects a failure on its working pw , it will
   notify the failure of its backup node or protector node by pw status
   message[1]. so that the backup node will transmit the service packet
   of the p2mp pw to the protected node.it is just as the following
