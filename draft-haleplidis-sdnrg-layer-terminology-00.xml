      <t> Software-Defined Networking introduces an abstraction layer and by doing so separates the Forwarding from the Control layer. This separation can allow faster innovation cycles at both layers as experience has already shown. However, there is increasing confusion as to what exactly SDN is, what is the layer stucture in an SDN architecture and how do layers interface with each other.
      This document aims to provide a concise reference for future discussions in SDNRG.</t>

    <section title="Network Devices" anchor="ND">
      <t>A Network Device, implemented in hardware or in software, physical or virtual, has both a Forwarding Plane and an Operational Plane. The Forwarding Plane, commonly referred to as the data path, is responsible for handling and forwarding of packets. The Operational Plane represents the operational state of the device, for example, with respect to network ports and interfaces.</t>
	  
      <t>The Forwarding and the Operational Planes can be exposed using a Device Abstraction Layer (DAL), which may comprise one or more abstraction models. Examples of Forwarding Plane abstraction models are the <xref target="RFC5812">ForCES model</xref> and the <xref target="OpenFlow1.3.1">OpenFlow switch model</xref>. Examples of the Operational Plane abstraction model include the <xref target="RFC5812">ForCES model</xref>, the <xref target="RFC6020">YANG model</xref> and <xref target="RFC3418">SNMP MIBs</xref>.</t>
	  
      <t>Applications can also reside in the network device. Examples of such applications are event monitoring, and offloading topology discovery or ARP in the device itself instead of forwarding such traffic to the control plane.</t>
    </section>
	
    <section title="Control Plane" anchor="CP">
      <t>The Control Plane communicates with the Forwarding Plane of devices using a Control Plane Southbound Interface (CPSI) with DAL as a point of reference and is responsible for instructing the Forwarding Plane on how to handle network packets. CPSI can be implemented using a protocol, an API or even interprocess communication. If the Control Plane and the Network Device are not collocated, then this interface is certainly a protocol. Examples of CPSIs are <xref target="RFC5810">ForCES</xref> and the <xref target="OpenFlow1.3.1">Openflow protocol</xref>.</t>

      <t>The Control Abstraction Layer (CAL) provides access to control applications and services to various CPSIs. The Control Plane may support more than one CPSIs.</t>
	  
      <t>Control applications can use CAL to control a network device without providing any service to upper layers. Examples include applications that perform control functions, such as OSPF, BGP, etc.</t>
	  
      <t>Control Plane Services provide access to other Services or Application above the control plane. Examples include a virtual private LAN service, service tunnels, etc.</t>
    </section>
	
    <section title="Management Plane" anchor="MP">
      <t>The Management Plane communicates with the network device Operational Plane using a Management Plane Southbound Interface (MPSI) with DAL as a point of reference. This interface can range from a protocol, to an API or even interprocess communication. If the Management Plane is not embedded in the network device, this interface is certainly a protocol. Examples of MPSIs are <xref target="RFC5810">ForCES</xref>, <xref target="RFC6241">NETCONF</xref>, <xref target="I-D.pfaff-ovsdb-proto">OVSDB</xref> and <xref target="RFC3411">SNMP</xref>.</t>
	  
      <t>The Management Abstraction Layer (MAL) provides access to management applications and services to various MPSIs. The Management Plane may support more than one MPSI.</t>
	  
      <t>Management Applications can use MAL to manage the network device without providing any service to upper layers. Examples of management applications include network monitoring applications.</t>
	  
      <t>Management Plane Services provide access to other services or application above the Management Plane.</t>
	  
    </section>

    <section title="Service Abstraction Layer" anchor="SAL">

	<t>The Service Abstraction Layer (SAL) provides access from services of the control, management and applciation plane to services and applications of the application plane. Examples of service interfaces are REST APIs.</t>
	  
    </section>
	
    <section title="Application Plane" anchor="AP">
    <t>Applications and services that use services from the control and/or management plane form the Application Plane.</t>
    <t>Addditionally, services residing in the Application Plane may provide services to other services and applications that reside in the application plane via the service interface.</t>
    <t>Examples of applications include network topology discovery, network provisioning, path reservation, etc.</t>

    <t>We advocate that the SDN southbound interface should encompass both the CSPI and the MSPI.</t>
