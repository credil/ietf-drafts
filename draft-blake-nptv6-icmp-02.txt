        ICMP Handling in IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation
                       draft-blake-nptv6-icmp-02

Abstract

   NPTv6 is a stateless, transport-agnostic IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix
   Translation function that provides the address-independence benefit
   associated with IPv4-to-IPv4 NAT without some of that mechanism's
   drawbacks.  NPTv6 is intended to be deployed in environments where a
   host might not know its "external" network prefix(es).  In such an
   environment, a NPTv6 device must also translate network prefixes
   present in in-bound and out-bound ICMPv6 error message payloads.
   This document describes the required processing of ICMPv6 error
   messages.

Internet-Draft           ICMP Handling in NPTv6               March 2012


1.  Introduction

   NPTv6 [RFC6296] is a stateless, transport-agnostic network prefix
   translation function for IPv6-to-IPv6 communication, which is
   intended to be deployed at the edge of networks which have been
   delegated provider-aggregatable (PA) network prefixes from one or
   more providers.  By allowing hosts within a network to be numbered
   using stable address prefixes (e.g., Unique Local Addresses
   [RFC4193]), these hosts do not needed to be renumbered whenever there
   is a change in the available PA network prefixes for the network, due
   to loss of connectivity or a change in providers.

   NPTv6 achieves its stateless property by performing a 1:1 network
   prefix translation operation which is checksum-neutral with respect
   to the 16-bit one's complement checksum function implemented in TCP,
   UDP, DCCP, and ICMPv6.  Therefore, NPTv6 is (mostly) transparent to
   applications which do not perform address referrals or otherwise
   exchange IPv6 addresses.

   ICMPv6 [RFC4443] error messages (Destination Unreachable, Packet Too
   Big, Time Exceeded, and Parameter Problem) embed the IPv6 header of
   the packet triggering the error message, along with as much of the
   original packet's payload as will fit without exceeding the IPv6
   minimum MTU [RFC2460].  If an ICMPv6 error message is originated in
   an external network destined for a host behind a NPTv6 device, then
   that device must translate the IPv6 source address embedded in the
   error message payload; otherwise the destination host will not
   recognize the error message as pertaining to itself, since the source
   address in the error message payload contains an external network
   prefix, rather than the internal address prefix configured on the
   host.  Similarly, if a host behind a NPTv6 device generates an ICMPv6
   error message in response to a packet received from a host in an
   external network, then the NPTv6 device must translate the IPv6
   destination address embedded in the error message payload; otherwise
   the external host will not recognize the error message, since it will
   seem to pertain to a packet sent to a host with an unknown network
   prefix.

   Additional translation operations do not need to be performed on
   ICMPv6 informational messages, because such messages do not embed
   IPv6 addresses [RFC4443].  In the particular case of ICMPv6 "Echo
   Request" and "Echo Reply" messages, the identifier and sequence
   number fields do not need to be modified.  Since NPTv6 devices do not
   perform address multiplexing, the identifier and sequence number
   spaces of multiple hosts behind the NPTv6 device do not need to be
   mapped into a smaller set of collision-free number spaces.

   This document details the processing steps required by a NPTv6 device

   to correctly process ICMPv6 packets traversing the device between the
   internal and external networks.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  ICMPv6 Error Message Network Prefix Translation

   As described in [RFC4443], ICMPv6 error messages are encoded with a
   Type value from 0 to 127.  Each of the defined error messages
   (Destination Unreachable, Packet Too Big, Time Exceeded, and
   Parameter Problem) contains a message body which includes the IPv6
   header of the invoking packet along with as much of the invoking
   packet's payload as will fit without exceeding the minimum IPv6 MTU.
   In each case the embedded IPv6 header is located at an offset of 8
   bytes from the first byte of the ICMPv6 message.  The embedded
   payload of the invoking IPv6 packet must include the upper-layer
   protocol type; otherwise the intended recipient of the error message
   will not be able to reliably deliver the error message to the
   appropriate upper-layer protocol for processing.

   ICMPv6 messages include a 16-bit checksum field.  The checksum is the
   16-bit one's complement of the one's complement sum of the entire
   ICMPv6 message, starting with the ICMPv6 message type field, and
   prepended with a "pseudo-header" of IPv6 header fields, with a next
   header value in the pseudo-header of 58 [RFC2460], [RFC4443].
   Because the embedded IPv6 addresses in an ICMPv6 error message body
   are 16-bit aligned, then the network prefix translation function
   defined in [RFC6296] is also ICMPv6 checksum-neutral when applied to
   the embedded IPv6 addresses.

   Whenever a packet traverses a NPTv6 device from an external host to
   an internal host behind the device, the device performs a checksum-
   neutral network prefix translation on the packet's destination
   address: from an external prefix to the internal one.  If the packet
   is an ICMPv6 error message, then the NPTv6 device must also translate
   the IPv6 source address embedded in the error message body, since
   this is the internal source address of the host that a) transmitted
   the invoking packet, and b) which is the intended destination of the
   ICMPv6 error message.  Since the translated address of the internal
   host is the same in both cases, it is sufficient to compute the
   translated network prefix once, and copy it into both the destination
   address of the packet's IPv6 header, as well as the source address of

Internet-Draft           ICMP Handling in NPTv6               March 2012


   the IPv6 header embedded in the ICMPv6 error message body.

   Whenever a packet traverses a NPTv6 device from an internal host
   behind the device to an external host, the device performs a
   checksum-neutral network prefix translation on the packet's source
   address: from the internal prefix to an external one.  If the packet
   is an ICMPv6 error message, then the NPTv6 device must also translate
   the IPv6 destination address embedded in the error message body,
   since this is the internal destination address of the host that a)
   received the invoking packet, and b) which is the source of the
   ICMPv6 error message.  Since the translated address of the internal
   host is the same in both cases, it is sufficient to compute the
   translated network prefix once, and copy it into both the source
   address of the packet's IPv6 header, as well as the destination
   address of the IPv6 header embedded in the ICMPv6 error message body.

   [RFC5508] defines requirements for ICMPv4 processing in IPv4-to-IPv4
   NAT devices.  That document specifies that the NAT device should
   validate the checksum of ICMPv4 error messages, and should silently
   drop the message if the checksum is invalid.  This is recommended
   because IPv4-to-IPv4 NAT is stateful, and the embedded IPv4 addresses
   in the ICMPv4 message payload are used to lookup the NAT translation
   session.  NPTv6 is stateless, and the IPv6 addresses embedded within
   an ICMPv6 error message are not used to lookup state.  Therefore,
   there is no needed for the NPTv6 device to validate the ICMPv6
   checksum.

   [RFC4884] defines changes to the ICMPv6 "Destination Unreachable" and
   "Time Exceeded" error messages to support multi-part operation, using
   a common ICMP extension header that is appended to the original
   datagram embedded in the ICMP message.  The format changes (i.e., the
   addition of an 8-bit "Length" field within the existing "Unused"
   field) does not affect the offset of the embedded IPv6 header, nor do
   the defined ICMP extensions embed IPv6 addresses which require
   translation.  Therefore, the rules for ICMPv6 error message
   processing above also apply to multi-part ICMPv6 "Destination
   Unreachable" and "Time Exceeded" messages.

4.  Example

   Let us consider the configuration described in paragraph 2.1 of
   [RFC6296].

               External Network:  Prefix = 2001:0DB8:0001:/48
                   --------------------------------------
                                     |
                                     |
                              +-------------+
                              |    NPTv6    |
                              |  Translator |
                              +-------------+
                                     |
                                     |
                   --------------------------------------
               Internal Network:  Prefix = FD01:0203:0405:/48

                       Figure 1: A simple translator

   A computer - let us call it Alice - is connected to the internal
   network, and is trying to access a server on the Internet.  Let us
   assume that Alice wishes to determine the path MTU to the server; the
   PMTU discovery technique uses the ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big" error
   message.  It is thus expected that at least at the first message of a
   flow will result in an ICMPv6 error message.

   Let us assume that Alice's IP Address is FD01:0203:0405:0001::
   1234/48.  Applying the algorithm described in [RFC6296], Alice's
   external IP address is 2001:0DB8:0001:D550::1234/48 - remember that
   Alice does not know her external address.  Let us also consider 2001:
   0DB8:cafe::5678 to be the server's IP address.

   The first packet sent by Alice to the server is similar to this:

                  +----------------------------+
                  | IPv6 Header Fields         |
                  | FD01:0203:0405:0001::1234  |
                  | 2001:0DB8:cafe::5678       |
                  | ----------------           |
                  | Layer 4 datagram           |
                  +----------------------------+

   The NPTv6 translator modifies the packet to resemble:

                  +----------------------------+
                  | IPv6 Header Fields         |
                  | 2001:0DB8:0001:D550::1234  |
                  | 2001:0DB8:cafe::5678       |
                  | ----------------           |
                  | Layer 4 datagram           |
                  +----------------------------+

   A router on the path to the server cannot support such a big packet
   and sends an ICMP Error message "Packet Too Big" (Type: 2, Code: 0)
   back to Alice.  This packet is similar to this:

                  +----------------------------+
                  | IPv6 Header Fields         |
                  | 2001:0DB8:babe::1          |
                  | 2001:0DB8:0001:D550::1234  |
                  | ----------------           |
                  | 2 - 0 - checksum           |
                  | IPv6 Header Fields         |
                  | 2001:0DB8:0001:D550::1234  |
                  | 2001:0DB8:cafe::5678       |
                  | ...                        |
                  +----------------------------+

   We see that the payload of the ICMPv6 error message begins with
   Alice's original packet, which contains as source address her
   external IP address.

   The NPTv6 translator will receive this packet, and according to
   [RFC6296] it will change the destination address field of this IPv6
   packet to Alice's internal IP address - FD01:0203:0405:0001::1234.
   The packet would thus become:

                  +----------------------------+
                  | IPv6 Header Fields         |
                  | 2001:0DB8:babe::1          |
                  | FD01:0203:0405:0001::1234  |
                  | ----------------           |
                  | 2 - 0 - checksum           |
                  | IPv6 Header Fields         |
                  | 2001:0DB8:0001:D550::1234  |
                  | 2001:0DB8:cafe::5678       |
                  | ...                        |
                  +----------------------------+

   Alice would receive this packet but will not understand it: the
   source IP address of the ICMPv6 error message payload does not match
   her configured (internal) address.  Hence the packet would be

   discarded.  An additional manipulation must be performed, allowing
   Alice to process this message as it should: the NPTv6 translator must
   change the source IP address of the ICMPv6 error message payload to
   Alice's internal address.  The packet then becomes:

                  +----------------------------+
                  | IPv6 Header Fields         |
                  | 2001:0DB8:babe::1          |

                  +----------------------------+


5.  Hairpinning

   [RFC6296] specifies that NPTv6 devices MUST support hairpinning
   behavior, as defined in [RFC4787].  This requirement must also apply
   to ICMPv6 messages.  Hairpinned ICMPv6 informational messages do not
   require any ICMPv6 message translation, as mentioned in Sec. 1.
   Hairpinned ICMPv6 error messages MUST be processed using the
   mechanisms defined in Sec. 3.


6.  Detecting ICMPv6 Error Messages

   It is necessary to identify ICMPv6 error messages so that the
   required network prefix translation of the embedded IPv6 addresses
   can be performed.  ICMPv6 messages are identified by a next header
   value of 58, and error message are distinquished by ICMPv6 type
   values from 0 to 127 [RFC4443].  In the absence of IPv6 extension
   headers in a packet, a NPTv6 device can detect an ICMPv6 message
   directly by examining the next header value within the packet's IPv6
   header [RFC2460].  However, if one or more IPv6 extension headers are
   present, then it is necessary for the NPTv6 device to skip past each
   extension header in sequence to determine whether an ICMPv6 message
   is present in the packet.  This processing MUST be performed for
   every packet traversing the NPTv6 device.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

8.  Security Considerations

   Because a NPTv6 device is a middle box in the path of communications
   crossing a network boundary, it is in the position to eavesdrop and
   perform a wide variety of network attacks if not secured.  Improper
   implementation of the network prefix translation procedure described
   in this document does not introduce additional security
   vulnerabilities.  Incorrectly translated IPv6 addresses in ICMPv6
   error message bodies will result in the recipient host discarding the
   error message silenty.
