                Conference Focus Indicating CCMP Support
                draft-yusef-dispatch-ccmp-indication-02

Abstract

   The Centralized Conferencing Manipulation Protocol document defines a
   way for a client to discover a conference control server that
   supports CCMP. However, it does not define a way for a client
   involved in a conference to determine if the conference focus
   supports CCMP. This information would allow a CCMP-enabled client
   that joins a conference using SIP to also register for the XCON
   conference event package RFC4575 [RFC 4575] and take advantage of
   CCMP operations on the conference.

   This document describes a few options to address the above limitation
   with the pros and cons for each approach, and recommends two to be
   used depending on the need of the UA. The first approach uses the
   Call-Info header and as a result this document updates RFC3261. The
   second approach defines a new value for the 'purpose' parameter in
   the 'service-uris' element in the SIP conferencing event package, and
   as a result this document update RFC4575 [RFC 4575].

INTERNET DRAFT       Conference Focus CCMP Support      February 7, 2013


1  Introduction

   RFC 5238 [RFC5239] defines a framework for Centralized Conferencing,
   which allows participants to exchange media in a centralized unicast
   conference. The framework also outlines a set of conferencing
   protocols for building advanced conferencing applications.

   The CCMP protocol RFC 6503 [RFC6503] allows authenticated and
   authorized users to create, manipulate and delete conference objects.
    Operations on conferences include adding and removing participants,
   changing their roles, as well as adding and removing media streams
   and associated end points.

   The CCMP protocol defines a way for a client to determine if a
   conference control server supports CCMP, but it does not define a way
   for a client to determine if a conference focus supports CCMP.

   This document defines two mechanisms to address the above limitation.
   Other mechanisms that we considered are listed in Appendix A.


1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

INTERNET DRAFT       Conference Focus CCMP Support      February 7, 2013


2  Solutions

   This section defines the mechanisms that can be used to discover that
   a focus supports CCMP.


2.1 Call-Info

   This approach uses the Call-Info header in various requests and
   responses.

   The Call-Info header consists of two parts: a URI and a parameter.
   The purpose of the URI is to provide the XCON-URI of the focus, and
   the purpose of the parameter is to indicate that the focus supports
   CCMP.

   While the XCON-URI by itself should be enough to indicate that the
   focus supports CCMP, the purpose with a value of 'ccmp' provides an
   easier way for a UA that is not interested in the URI to discover
   that the focus supports CCMP without parsing the URI.

   The Call-Info header, with the XCON-URI and the purpose parameter
   with the 'ccmp' value, can be used with any INVITE request or
   response and with a response to an OPTIONS request.

   The following is the updated ABNF for the Call-Info header:

      Call-Info   =  "Call-Info" HCOLON info *(COMMA info)
      info        =  LAQUOT absoluteURI RAQUOT *( SEMI info-param)
      info-param  =  ( "purpose" EQUAL ( "icon" / "info"
                     / "card" / "ccmp" / token ) ) / generic-param


2.2 Service URI purpose

   This approach defines an additional URI 'purpose' of 'ccmp'
   associated with a 'service-uris' element in the SIP conferencing
   event package.  The XCON-URI for the conference is included in the
   'uri' element, per the following example:

      <service-uris>
        <entry>
          <uri>XCON:conf1@example.com</uri>
          <purpose>ccmp</purpose>
        </entry>
      </service-uris>

3  Security Considerations

   These proposals introduce no additional security considerations
   beyond those which are applicable to each of the mechanisms described
   herein.


4  IANA Considerations


   This document defines a new value for the "purpose" parameter of the
   Call-Info header field and adds a new value for the "purpose" in the
   URI Purposes Sub-registry of the SIP Parameters registry.


4.1 Call-Info Header "purpose" Parameter

                                     Predefined
   Header Field     Parameter Name     Values     Reference
   ---------------  ---------------   ---------   ---------
   Call-Info        purpose             Yes       [RFC3261] [RFC5367]



[OPEN ISSUE] Currently, there is no parameter registry for the Call Info
header "purpose" values. Should a new registry be created for that?



4.2 URI Purposes Sub-registry

   This specification defines a new "purpose" value of "ccmp" in the URI
   Purposes Sub-registry in the sip-parameters registry:
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters/

   The new entry in the sub-registry is as follows:

      Value         Description                           Document
      -------       ----------------------------------    ---------

      ccmp          The URI can be used to                [RFCxxxx]
                    access a conference that
                    supports CCMP.

   Note to RFC Editor: Please replace RFC XXXX with the RFC number of
   this specification.

INTERNET DRAFT       Conference Focus CCMP Support      February 7, 2013


Appendix A. Other Approaches Considered

A.1 Feature Tag

   This approach defines a feature parameter 'ccmp' to express that a
   SIP dialog belongs to a conference that supports CCMP.  The use of
   feature parameters in Contact header fields to describe the
   characteristics and capabilities of a UA is described in the User
   Agent Capabilities document.

   The focus behavior regarding the handling of the 'ccmp' feature is
   the same as the handling of the 'isfocus' feature parameter. In
   session establishment, a focus MUST include the 'ccmp' feature
   parameter in the Contact header field unless the focus wishes to hide
   the fact that it is a focus.

   The pros of this approach is a one step discovery of the focus and
   its ccmp support, and the fact that it can be used in response to an
   OPTIONS request, and that it enables the discovery of the ccmp
   capability by any network element that does not need the conference
   event package. The cons is the definition of a new feature parameter.


A.2 Conference URI purpose

   Define an additional URI 'purpose' of 'ccmp' associated with a
   'confs-uris' element in the SIP conferencing event package.

   ccmp: Indicates that the conference focus represented by this URI
   supports ccmp, which allows a client to use the CCMP protocol to
   manipulate the conference. This URI MUST be an XCON-URI as defined in
   the xcon-data-model.

         <conf-uris>
           <entry>
             <uri>XCON:conf1@example.com</uri>
             <display-text>whatever</display-text>
             <purpose>ccmp</purpose>
           </entry>
         </conf-uris>

   The pro of the SIP conference event package options is the use of an
   existing mechanism for extending the <purpose> field of the <service-
   uris> or <conf-uris> elements. The con is the requirement that the
   client register for the conference event package.  However, given
   that clients that want to take advantage of CCMP would most likely
   register for the conference event packages.
