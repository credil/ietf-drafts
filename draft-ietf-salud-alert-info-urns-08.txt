URNs for the Alert-Info Header Field of the Session Initiation Protocol
                                 (SIP)
                  draft-ietf-salud-alert-info-urns-08

Abstract

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the capability to
   provide a reference to a specific rendering to be used by the UA when
   the user is alerted.  This is done using the Alert-Info header field.
   However, the reference (typically a URL) addresses only a specific
   network resource with specific rendering properties.  There is
   currently no support for standard identifiers for describing the
   semantics of the alerting situation or the characteristics of the
   alerting signal, without being tied to a particular rendering.  To
   overcome these limitations and support new applications, a new family
   of URNs for use in SIP Alert-Info header fields (and situations with
   similar requirements) is defined in this specification.

   This document normatively updates [RFC3261], the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP): It changes the usage of the SIP Alert-Info header
   field defined in the [RFC3261] by additionally allowing its use in
   all provisional responses to INVITE (except the 100 response).

Internet-Draft                 Alert URNs                      July 2013


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] includes a means to
   suggest to a user agent (UA) a particular ringback tone or ring tone
   to be used during session establishment.  In [RFC3261] this is done
   by including a URI in the Alert-Info header field, that specifies the
   tone.  The URI is most commonly the HTTP URL to the audio file.  On
   the receipt of the Alert-Info header field the user agent may fetch
   the referenced ringback tone or ring tone and play it to the user.

   This mechanism hinders interoperability when there is no common
   understanding of the meaning of the referenced tone, which might be
   country- or vendor-specific.  It can lead to problems for the user
   trying to interpret the tone and for the UA wanting to substitute its
   own tone (e.g., in accordance with user preferences) or provide an
   alternative alerting mode (e.g., for hearing-impaired users).  If
   caller and callee are from different countries, the understanding of
   the tones may vary significantly.  Hearing impaired users may not
   sense the specific tone if it is provided as an audio file.  The tone
   per se is also not useful for automata.

   There are currently interoperability issues around the use of the
   Alert-Info header field when not using an external ring file.  For
   example, consider the PBX special ring tone for an external (to the
   PBX) caller.  Different vendors use different approaches such as:
   Alert-Info: <file://ring.pcm>;alert=normal where ring.pcm is a dummy
   file or: Alert-Info: <file://normal.ring.pcm> or: Alert-Info:
   <sip:normal-ringtone@example.com>.  As a result, Alert-Info currently
   only works when the same vendor provides PBX and UA, as only then if
   the same "fake" proprietary URI convention used.

   Another limitation of the current solution is that the referenced
   tones are tied to particular rendering.  It is not possible to
   provide semantic indications or names for rendering characteristics
   that signals the intent and allows the recipient UA to decide how to
   render the received information in an appropriate way.

   To solve the described issues, this specification defines the new URN
   namespace "alert" for the Alert-Info header field that allows for
   programmatic user interface adaptation and for conversion of
   equivalent alerting tones in the Public Switched Telephone Network
   (PSTN) when the client is a gateway.  The work to standardize an
   "alert" URN will increase SIP interoperability for this header field
   by replacing proprietary conventions used today.

   Using the "alert" namespace provides syntax for several different

Internet-Draft                 Alert URNs                      July 2013


   application spaces, e. g.:

   o  Names for service indications, such as call waiting or automatic
      callback, not tied to any particular rendering.
   o  Names for common ring tones generated by PBX phones for cases such
      as an internal enterprise caller, external caller, ringback tone
      after a transfer failure or expiration of a hold timer, etc.
   o  Names for country-specific ringback tones.
   o  Names for things with specific renderings that aren't purely
      audio.  They might be static icons, video sequences, text, etc.

   Some advantages of a URN rather than a URL of a downloadable
   resource:

   o  Do not need to download it or deal with security issues associated
      with dereferencing.
   o  No formatting or compatibility issues.
   o  No security risk of rendering something unexpected and
      undesirable.
   o  The tone can be stored locally in whatever format and at whatever
      quality level is appropriate, because it is specified "by name"
      rather than "by value".
   o  It is easier to make policy decisions about whether to use it or
      not.
   o  It facilitates translation for the hearing impaired.

   The downside is that if the recipient does not understand the URN
   then it will only be able to render a default ringback tone or ring
   tone.

   This document creates a new URN namespace and registry for alert
   indications and registers some initial values.

1.2.  Alert-Info Header Field Usage Change

   This specification changes the usage of the SIP Alert-Info header
   field defined in the [RFC3261] by additionally allowing its use in
   all provisional responses to INVITE (except the 100 response).

   Previously, the Alert-Info header field was only permitted in 180
   (Ringing) responses.  But in telephony, other situations indicated by
   SIP provisional responses, such as 181 (Call Is Being Forwarded) and
   182 (Call Is Being Queued), are often indicated by tones.  Extending
   the applicability of Alert-Info allows the telephony practice to be
   implemented in SIP.

   In practice, this specification extends Alert-Info in that it will
   cause the use of a new class of URIs and the use of multiple URIs.

Internet-Draft                 Alert URNs                      July 2013


   Backward compatibility issues are not expected, as devices that do
   not understand an "alert" URN should ignore it, and devices should
   not malfunction upon receiving multiple Alert-Info alert-params
   (which was syntactically permitted before, but rarely used).

1.3.  Terminology

   This specification uses a number of terms to refer to the roles
   involved in the use of alerting indications in SIP.  A "specifier"
   sends an "alerting indication" (one or more URNs in an Alert-Info
   header field) to a "renderer" which then "renders" a "signal" or
   "rendering" based on the indication to a human user.  A "category" is
   a characteristic whose "values" can be used to classify indications.

   This specification uses the terms "ring tone" and "ringback tone".  A
   "ring tone" or "calling signal" (terminology used in [E182]) is a
   signal generated by the callee's end device, advising the callee
   about an incoming call.  A "ringback tone" or "ringing tone"
   (terminology used in [E182]) is a signal advising the caller that a
   connection has been made and that a ring tone is being rendered to
   the callee.


2.  Requirements

   This section discusses the requirements for an alerting indication to
   transport the semantics of the alerting situation or the
   characteristics of the rendering.

   REQ-1: The mechanism will allow user agents (UAs) and proxies to
   provide in the Alert-Info header field an alerting indication which
   describes the semantics of the signaling situation or the
   characteristics of the rendering and allows the recipient to decide
   how to render the received information to the user.

   REQ-2: The mechanism will allow the alerting indication to be
   specified "by name" rather than "by value", to enable local policy
   decisions whether to use it or not.

   REQ-3: The mechanism will enable alerting indications to represent a
   wide variety of signals, which have many largely-orthogonal
   characteristics.

   REQ-4: has been deleted.  To avoid confusion, the number will not be
   reused.

   REQ-5: The mechanism will enable the set of alerting indications to
   be able to support extensibility by a wide variety of organizations

Internet-Draft                 Alert URNs                      July 2013


   that are not coordinated with each other.  Extensions will be able
   to:
   - add further values to any existing category
   - add further categories that are orthogonal to existing categories
   - semantically subdivide the meaning provided by any existing
   indication

   REQ-6: The mechanism will be flexible, so new alerting indications
   can be defined in the future, when SIP-applications evolve.  E. g.
   "alert" URNs could identify specific media by name, such as
   "Beethoven's Fifth", and the end device could render some small part
   of it as a ring tone.

   REQ-7: The mechanism will provide only an indication capability, not
   a negotiation capability.

   REQ-8: The mechanism will not require an alerting indication to
   depend on context provided by a previous alerting indication in
   either direction.

   REQ-9: The mechanism will allow transmission in the Alert-Info header
   field of SIP INVITE requests and provisional 1xx responses excepting
   the 100 responses.

   REQ-10: The mechanism will be able to accommodate renderers that are
   customized with a limited or uncommon set of signals they can render
   and renderers that are provided with a set of signals that have
   uncommon semantics.  (The canonical example is a UA for the hearing-
   impaired, customized with an uncomon set of signals, video or text
   instead of audio.  By REQ-7, the renderer has no way of transmitting
   this fact to the specifier.)

   REQ-11: The mechanism will allow an alerting indication to reliably
   carry all extensions if the specifier and the renderer have designs
   that are properly coordinated.

   REQ-12: The mechanism will allow a renderer to select a tone that
   approximates to that intended by the specifier if the renderer is
   unable to provide the precise tone indicated.

   REQ-13: The mechanism will support alerting indications relating to
   services such as call waiting, forward, transfer-recall, auto-
   callback and hold-recall.

   REQ-14: The mechanism will allow rendering common PBX ring tone
   types.

   REQ-15: The mechanism will allow rendering specific country ringback

   tones.

   REQ-16: The mechanism will allow rendering tones for emergency
   alerts.  (Use cases and values definition are not subject of this
   specification.)

   REQ-17: The mechanism will allow rendering using other means than
   tones, e.g. text or images.

   REQ-18: The mechanism will allow TDM gateways to map ring/ringback
   tones from legacy protocols to SIP at the edge of a network, e.g.
   national ring tones as defined in TIA/EIA-41-D and 3GPP2 A.S0014.
   (Use cases and values definition are not subject of this
   specification.)

   REQ-19: The mechanism will ensure that if an UA receives "alert" URNs
   or portions of an "alert" URN it does not understand, it can ignore
   them.

   REQ-20 The mechanism will allow storage of the actual encoding of the
   rendering locally rather than fetching it.

   REQ-21: The mechanism must provide a simple way to combine two
   alerting indications to produce an alerting indication that requests
   a combination of the intentions of the two alerting indications,
   where any contradictions or conflicts between the two alerting
   indications are resolved in favor of the intention of the first
   alerting indication.


3.  Use Cases

   This section describes some use cases for which the "alert" URN
   mechanism is needed today.

3.1.  PBX Ring Tones

   This section defines some commonly encountered ring tones on PBX or
   business phones.  They are as follows:

3.1.1.  normal

   This tone indicates that the default or normal ring tone should be
   rendered.  This is essentially a no-operation "alert" URN and should
   be treated by the UA as if no "alert" URN is present.  This is most
   useful when Alert-Info header field parameters are being used.  For
   example, in [I-D.ietf-bliss-shared-appearances], an Alert-Info header
   field needs to be present containing the "appearance" parameter, but

Internet-Draft                 Alert URNs                      July 2013


   no special ring tone needs to be specified.

   [Note to RFC Editor: Please update the information for this reference
   and change its tag from "I-D.ietf-bliss-shared-appearances" to the
   appropriate RFC number.]

3.1.2.  external

   This tone is used to indicate that the caller is external to the
   enterprise or PBX system.  This could be a call from the PSTN or from
   a SIP trunk.

3.1.3.  internal

   This tone is used to indicate that the caller is internal to the
   enterprise or PBX system.  The call could have been originated from
   another user on this PBX or on another PBX within the enterprise.

3.1.4.  priority

   A PBX tone needs to indicate that a priority level alert should be
   applied for the type of alerting specified (e.g. internal alerting).

3.1.5.  short

   In this case the alerting type specified (e.g. internal alerting)
   should be rendered shorter than normal.  In contact centers, this is
   sometimes referred to as "abbreviated ringing" or a "zip tone".

3.1.6.  delayed

   In this case the alerting type specified should be rendered after a
   short delay.  In some bridged line/shared line appearance
   implementations, this is used so that the bridged line does not ring
   at exactly the same time as the main line, but is delayed a few
   seconds.

3.2.  Service Tones

   These tones are used to indicate specific PBX and public network
   telephony services.

3.2.1.  call-waiting

   The Call Waiting Service [TS24.615] permits a callee to be notified
   of an incoming call while the callee is engaged in an active or held
   call.  Subsequently, the callee can either accept, reject, or ignore
   the incoming call.  There is an interest on the caller side to be

Internet-Draft                 Alert URNs                      July 2013


   informed about the call waiting situation on the callee side.  Having
   this information the caller can decide whether to continue waiting
   for callee to pickup or better to call some time later when it is
   estimated that the callee could have finished the ongoing
   conversation.  To provide this information, the callee's UAS ( or
   proxy) aware of the call waiting condition can add the call-waiting
   indication to the Alert-Info header field in the 180 Ringing
   response.  As call-waiting information may be subject to the callee's
   privacy concerns, the exposure of this information shall be done only
   if explicitly required by the callee.

3.2.2.  forward

   This feature is used in a 180 Ringing response when a call forwarding
   feature has been initiated on an INVITE.  Many PBX system implement a
   forwarding "beep" followed by normal ringing to indicate this.  Note
   that a 181 response can be used in place of this URN.

3.2.3.  transfer-recall

   This feature is used when a blind transfer [RFC5589] has been
   performed by a server on behalf of the transferor and fails.  Instead
   of failing the call, the server calls back the transferor, giving
   them another chance to transfer or otherwise deal with the call.
   This service tone is used to distinguish this INVITE from any other
   normal incoming call.

3.2.4.  auto-callback

   This feature is used when a user has utilized a server to implement
   an automatic callback service [RFC6910].  When the user is available,
   the server calls back the user and utilizes this service tone to
   distinguish this from any other normal incoming call.

3.2.5.  hold-recall

   This feature is used when a server implements a call hold timer on
   behalf of an endpoint.  After a certain period of time of being on
   hold, the user who placed the call on hold is alerted to either
   retrieve the call or otherwise dispose of the call.  This service
   tone is used to distinguish this case from any other normal incoming
   call.

3.3.  Country-specific ringback tone indications for the public
      telephone network

   In the PSTN, different tones are used in different countries.  End
   users are accustomed to hear the callee's country ringback tone and

4.  URN Specification for the "alert"  namespace identifier

   This section provides the registration template for the "alert" URN
   namespace identifier (NID) according to [RFC2141] and [RFC3406]

   Namespace ID:  alert

   Registration Information:

      Registration version:  1
      Registration date:  TBD

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

      Registering organization:  Real-time Applications and
         Infrastructure Area IETF
      Designated contact:  RAI Area Director
      Designated contact email:  rai at ietf.org

   Declaration of syntactic structure:
      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) for the "alert" URNs is called
      an <alert-identifier> and has a hierarchical structure.  The first
      colon-separated part after "alert" is called the <alert-category>;
      the parts to the right of that are <alert-ind-part>s, and together
      form the <alert-indication>.  The general form is
      urn:alert:<alert-category>:<alert-indication>.

      The following <alert-category> identifiers defined in [RFCXXXX]:
      "service" , "priority" , "source" , "duration", "delay" and
      "locale".  The <alert-category> set can be extended in the future,
      either by standardization or by private action.  The <alert-
      category>s describe distinct features of alerting signals.

      RFC EDITOR NOTE: Please change XXXX in [RFCXXXX] by the new RFC
      number, when assigned.

      Any "alert" URN defined in this specification is syntactically
      valid for ring and ringback tones and can be used in INVITE
      requests or in provisional 1xx responses excepting the 100
      response.

      Registered URNs and components thereof MUST be transmitted as
      registered (including case).  A new URN MUST NOT be registered if
      it is equal by the comparison rules to an already registered URN.

   Namespace considerations:  This specification defines a URN namespace
      "alert" for URNs representing signals or renderings which are
      presented to users to inform them of events and actions.  The
      initial usage is to specify ring tones and ringback tones when
      dialogs are established in SIP, but they can also be used for
      other commuication-initiation protocols (e.g., H.323), and more
      generally, in any situation (e.g., web pages or endpoint device
      software configurations) to describe how a user should be
      signaled.

Internet-Draft                 Alert URNs                      July 2013



      An "alert" URN does not describe a complete signal, but rather
      describes a particular characteristic of the event it is signaling
      or a feature of the signal to be presented.  The complete
      specification of the signal is a sequence of "alert" URNs
      specifying the desired characteristics/significance of the signal
      in priority order, with the most important aspects specified by
      the earlier URNs.  This allows the sender of a sequence of URNs to
      compose very detailed specifications from a restricted set of
      URNs, and to clearly specify which aspects of the specification it
      considers most important.

      The initial scope of usage is in the SIP Alert-Info header field,
      in initial INVITE requests (to indicate how the called user should
      be alerted regarding the call) and non-100 provisional (1xx)
      responses to those INVITE requests (to indicate the ringback, how
      the calling user should be alerted regarding the progress of the
      call).

      In order to assure widespread adoption of these URNs for
      indicating ring tones and ringback tones, the scheme must allow
      replication of the current diversity of these tones.  Currently,
      these tones vary between the PSTNs of different nations and
      between equipment supplied by different vendors.  Thus, the scheme
      must accommodate national variations and proprietary extensions in
      a way that minimizes the information that is lost during
      interoperation between systems that follow different national
      variations or that are supplied by different vendors.

      The scheme allows definition of private extension URNs that refine
      and extend the information provided by standard URNs.  Private
      extension URNs can also refine and extend the information provided
      by other private extension URNs.  Private extensions can also
      define entirely new categories of information about calls.  We
      expect these extensions to be used extensively when existing PBX
      products are converted to support SIP operation.

      The device that receives an Alert-Info header field containing a
      sequence of "alert" URNs provides to the user a rendering that
      represents the semantic content of the URNs.  The device is given
      great leeway in choosing the rendering, but it is constrained by
      rules that maximize interoperability between systems that support
      different sets of private extensions.  In particular, earlier URNs
      in the sequence have priority of expression over later URNs in the
      sequence, and URNs that are not usable in their entirety (because
      they contain unknown extensions or are incompatible with previous
      URNs) are successively truncated in attempt to construct a URN
      that retains some information and is renderable in the context.

Internet-Draft                 Alert URNs                      July 2013



      Due to the practical importance of private extensions for the
      adoption of URNs for alerting calls and the very specific rules
      for private extensions and the corresponding processing rules that
      allow quality interoperation in the face of private extensions,
      the requirements of the "alert" URN schems cannot be met by a
      fixed enumeration of URNs and corresponding meanings.  In
      particular, the existing namespace "urn:ietf:params" does not
      suffice (unless the private extension apparatus is applied to that
      namespace).

      [Note, to be deleted for the final version of this draft: Because
      the work on this draft has lasted for about four years, the new
      "alert" URN namespace is already used in finalized specifications
      of other SDOs (3GPP).  There are already existing implementations
      in products and large carrier networks. <urn:alert:service:normal>
      is also specified for use in draft-ietf-bliss-shared-appearances.]

      There do not appear to be other URN namespaces that uniquely
      identify the semantic of a signal or rendering feature.  Unlike
      most other currently registered URN namespaces, the "alert" URN
      does not identify documents and protocol objects (e.g., [RFC3044],
      [RFC3120], [RFC3187], [RFC3188], [RFC4179], [RFC4195], [RFC4198]),
      types of telecommunications equipment [RFC4152], people or
      organizations [RFC3043].

      The <alert-URN>s are hierarchical identifiers.  An <alert-URN>
      asserts some fact or feature of the offered SIP dialog, or some
      fact or feature of how it should be presented to a user, or of how
      it is being presented to a user.  Removing an <alert-ind-part>
      from the end of an <alert-URN> (which has more than one <alert-
      ind-part>s) creates a shorter <alert-URN> with a less specific
      meaning; the set of dialogs to which the longer <alert-URN>
      applies is necessarily a subset of the set of dialogs to which the
      shorter <alert-URN> applies.  (If the starting <alert-URN>
      contains only one <alert-ind-part>, and thus the <alert-ind-part>
      cannot be removed to make a shorter <alert-URN>, we can consider
      the set of dialogs to which the <alert-URN> applies to be a subset
      of the set of all dialogs.)

      The specific criteria defining the subset to which the longer
      <alert-URN> applies, within the larger set of dialogs, is
      considered to be the meaning of the final <alert-ind-part>.  This
      meaning is relative to and depends upon the preceding <alert-
      category> and <alert-ind-part>s (if any).  The meanings of two
      <alert-ind-part>s that are textually the same but are preceded by
      different <alert-category>s or <alert-ind-part>s have no necessary
      connection.  (An <alert-category> considered alone has no

Internet-Draft                 Alert URNs                      July 2013


      meaning.)

      The organization owning the <provider> within a <private-name>
      specifies the meaning of that <private-name> when it is used as an
      <alert-ind-part>.  (The organization owning a <provider> is
      determined by the rules in Section 7.2.)

      The organization owning the <provider> within a <private-name> (in
      either an <alert-category> or an <alert-ind-part>) specifies the
      meaning of each <alert-ind-part> which is an <alert-label> that
      follows that <private-name> and that precedes the next <alert-ind-
      part> which is a <private-name> (if any).

      The meaning of all other <alert-ind-part>s (i.e., those that are
      not <private-name>s and do not follow a <private-name>) is defined
      by standardization.

   Community considerations:  The "alert" URNs are relevant to a large
      cross-section of Internet users, namely those that initiate and
      receive communication connections via the Session Initiation
      Protocol.  These users include both technical and non-technical
      users, on a variety of devices and with a variety of perception
      capabilities.  The "alert" URNs will allow Internet users to
      receive more information about offered calls and enable them to
      better make decisions about accepting an offered call, and to get
      better feedback on the progress of a call they have made.

      User interfaces for perception-impaired users can better render
      the ring and ringback tones based on the "alert" URNs because the
      URNs provide more detailed information regarding the intention of
      communications than is provided by current SIP mechanisms.

   Process of identifier assignment:
      Assignment of standardized "alert" URNs is by insertion into the
      IANA registry described in Section 6.  This process defines the
      meanings of <alert-ind-part>s that have standardized meanings, as
      described in "Namespace Considerations".

      Private extensions are "alert" URNs that include <alert-ind-part>s
      that are <private-name>s and <alert-label>s that appear after a
      <private-name>s (either as an <alert-category> or an <alert-
      indication>).  If such an <alert-ind-part> is a <private-name>,
      its meaning is defined by the organization that owns the
      <provider> that appears in the <private-name>.  If the <alert-ind-
      part> is an <alert-label>, its meaning is defined by the
      organization that owns the <provider> that appears in the closest
      private-name> preceeding the <alert-label>.  The rules for
      determining the organization that owns a <provider> are given in

Internet-Draft                 Alert URNs                      July 2013


      Section 7.2.

   Identifier uniqueness and persistence considerations:  An "alert" URN
      identifies a semantic feature of a call or a sensory feature of
      how the call alerting should be a rendered at the caller's or
      callee's end device.

      For standardized <alert-ind-parts> in URNs, uniqueness and
      persistence of their meanings is guaranteed by the fact that they
      are registered with IANA in accordance with the procedures of
      Section 6; the feature identified by a particular "alert" URN is
      distinct from the feature identified by any other standardized
      "alert" URN.

      Assuring uniqueness and persistence of the meanings of private
      extensions is delegated to the organizations that define private
      extension <alert-ind-parts>.  The organization responsible for a
      particular <alert-ind-part> in a particular "alert" URN is the
      owner of a syntactically-determined <provider> part within the
      URN.  Once an organization obtains ownership of a particular
      <provider>, it retains ownership of it for all time, as described
      in Section 7.2.

      An organization SHOULD use only one <provider> value for all of
      the <private-name>s it defines.

   Process for identifier resolution:  The process of identifier
      resolution is the process by which a rendering device chooses a
      rendering to represent a sequence of "alert" URNs.  The device is
      allowed great leeway in making this choice, but the process must
      obey the rules of Section 8.1.  The device is expected to provide
      renderings that users associate with the meanings assigned to the
      URNs within their cultural context.  A non-normative example
      resolution algorithm is given in Section 9.1.

   Rules for lexical equivalence:  "alert" URNs are compared according
      to case-insensitive string equality, except that every <provider>
      part is treated as if the <date> component is present and has all
      omitted components as specified by the defaults in Section 7.3,
      viz., an omitted <date> defaults to "2013-01-01", an omitted <CC>
      defaults to "20", and an omitted <MM> or <DD> defaults to "01".

   Conformance with URN syntax:  All "alert" URNs must conform to the
      BNF in the 'Declaration of syntactic structure', which is a subset
      of the generic URN syntax.  Note that "internationalized" DNS
      labels may appear in <provider-id>s, in which case they must
      appear as A-labels, that is, as transformed by Punycode. <alert-
      label>s, that is, components that are not DNS labels, are

Internet-Draft                 Alert URNs                      July 2013


      constrained to be Non Reserved LDH-labels, that is, "ordinary
      ASCII labels".  Future standardization may allow <alert-label>s
      that are A-labels, and so interpreters of "alert" URNs must
      operate correctly when given such URNs as input.

   Validation mechanism:  An "alert" URN containing no private
      extensions can be validated based on the IANA registry of
      standardized "alert" URNs.  Validating an "alert" URN containing
      private extensions requires obtaining information regarding the
      private extensions defined by the organization that owns the
      <provider> in the relevant <private-name>.  The identity of the
      organization can be determined from public registries of
      historical ownership of domain names, in accordance with the
      procedures of Section 7.2.  However, if an "alert" URN contains at
      least one <alert-identifier> that precedes the first <private-
      name>, the portion of the "alert" URN that precedes the first
      <private-name> must itself be a valid standardized "alert" URN,
      which may be validated as above.

   Scope:  The scope for this URN is public and global.


5.  "Alert" URN Values Definitions

5.1.  <Alert-category> Values Definitions

   Following <alert-category> values are defined in this document:

   - service
   - source
   - priority
   - duration
   - delay
   - locale

5.2.  <Alert-indication>  Values Definitions

   This section describes the "alert" URN indication values for the
   alert-categories defined in this document.

   For each <alert-category> , a default <alert-indication> is defined,
   which is essentially a no-operation"alert" URN and should be treated
   by the UA as if no "alert" URN for the respective category is
   present. "alert" URN default indications are most useful when Alert-
   Info header field parameters are being used.  For example, in
   [I-D.ietf-bliss-shared-appearances], an Alert-Info header field needs
   to be present containing the "appearance" parameter, but no special
   ringtone need be specified.

5.2.6.  <Alert-indication>  Values for the <alert-category> 'locale'

   - default (default)
   - country:<ISO 3166-1 country code>
   - <private-name>

   The ISO 3166-1 country code [ISO3166-1] is used to inform the
   renderer on the other side of the call that a country-specific
   rendering should be used.  For example, to indicate ringback tones
   from South Africa, the following URN would be used:
   <urn:alert:locale:country:za>.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This section registers a new URN namespace identifier (NID), "alert",
   in accordance with RFC 3406 with the registration template provided
   in Section 4.

6.1.  Registry

   Standard "alert" URNs are identified by <alert-identifier>s managed
   by IANA, according to the processes outlined in [RFC5226], in a new
   registry called "Alert URN Identifiers".  Thus, creating a new
   standard "alert" URN requires IANA action.

   The registry contains: (1) <alert-category> values, (2) <alert-
   identifier> values, composed of an <alert-category> followed by an
   <alert-indication>, in turn composed of one or more <alert-label>s,
   and (3) patterns for <alert-identifier> values (e.g., for the
   "locale" <alert-category> in Section 6.2.6).

   The policy for adding a new standard <alert-category> is 'Standards
   Action'.  The policy for adding <alert-identifiers>s or patterns of
   <alert-identifiers>s within a particular <alert-category> may differ
   for each <alert-category>and MUST be defined by the document defining
   the corresponding <alert-category>.

   <alert-category> and <alert-identifier> values which contain
   <private-name>s are not managed by IANA.  The process of identifier

   assignement is described in Section 4.

6.2.  Initial IANA Registration

   This document defines the <alert-category>s 'service', 'source',
   'priority', 'duration', 'delay' and 'locale'.  The policy for adding
   an <alert-identifier> for any of these <alert-category>s is Standards
   Action.

   The entries to be added to the registration table have the following
   format:


      <alert-category>/      Reference    Description
      <alert-identifier>;
      ---------------------------------------------------------------
      foo                    RFCxyz     Description of the 'foo'
                                        <alert-category>;
      foo:bar                RFCabc     Description of the 'foo:bar'
                                        <alert-identifier>


   RFC EDITOR NOTE: Please change XXXX in [RFCXXXX] by the new RFC
   number, when assigned.

7.  Extension Rules

7.1.  General Extension Rules

   The set of "alert" URNs is extensible.  An extension "at the top
   level" creates an new <alert-category> (which represents a new
   alerting characteristic), an extension "at the second level" creates
   a new <alert-indication> value for an existing <alert-category> , an
   extension "at the third level" creates a subdivision of an existing
   <alert-indication> (that has one <alert-ind-part> ), etc.  URNs allow
   (in principle) indefinite subdivision of existing <alert-indication>
   values, although most of the standard "alert" URNs have only one
   level of subdivision and a few have two levels of subdivision.

   Designers of extensions should take care to derive the new URN from
   the most specific base URN which has the correct meaning; a new URN
   should have no semantic overlap with any sibling URN, i.e., there can
   be no calls to which both URNs could apply.

   The process for defining new standard "alert" URNs is described in
   Section 6.1.  Currently, all such definitions require Standards
   Action.  The process for defining new "alert" URNs via the private
   extension mechanism is described in Section 7.2 is Standards Action.

7.2.  Private Extension Rules

   The "<private-name>" syntax is used to create private extensions,
   extensions that are not registered with IANA.  The "<private-name>"
   has the form of an "<alert-label>" (which has the same syntax as an
   ordinary ASCII DNS label), followed by "@" and then a <provider> that
   designates the organization defining the extension.  A private
   extension URN is created by using a <private-name> as either an
   <alert-category> or an <alert-ind-part>.



Liess, et al.           Expires January 12, 2014               [Page 24]

Internet-Draft                 Alert URNs                      July 2013


   If the <private-name> is used as an <alert-category>, the
   characteristic of the alerting signal that the <alert-category>
   describes is defined by the organization.  If the <private-name> is
   used as the first <alert-ind-part>, the organization defines an
   alternative value for the standardized <alert-category> of the URN.
   If the <private-name> is used as the second or later <alert-ind-
   part>, the organization defines the meaning of the URN as a subset of
   the meaning of the shorter URN resulting when the <private-name> (and
   any subsequent <alert-ind-part>s) are removed.

   Within a URN, all <alert-label> components that follow a <private-
   name> but are before any following <private-name>s are additional
   private extensions whose meaning is defined by the organization
   defining the <private-name>.

   A URN that contains a private extension can be further subdivided by
   the private extension of a different organization: the second
   organization adds a <private-name> component containing a <provider>
   that is valid for the second organization.

   The meaning of a <private-name> or an <alert-label> that is defined
   privately (because of a preceding <private-name>) is only fixed
   within the context provided by the sequence of preceding <alert-
   name>s; these components have no meaning in isolation and there is no
   necessary relationship between the meaning of textually identical
   <alert-name>s that are preceded by different sequences of <alert-
   name>s. .

   Creating private extension "alert" URNs is not a standards action and
   they are not registered with IANA.

   Adding new categories and adding <alert-indication> values via the
   "private extension" mechanism is not a standards action.

   Once an organization obtains the right to use a particular <provider>
   for constructing <private-name>s, it will retain that right forever,
   unless it transfers that right to another organization.  The
   organization defining a private extension is responsible for ensuring
   persistence of the meaning of the private extension, and for ensuring
   that the private extension does not duplicate any standard URN or any
   private extension that the organization is aware of.  (In either
   case, the organization SHOULD use the existing URN for its purposes.)

7.3.  Interpreting <provider> values

   The organization that defines a particular <private-name> is
   determined by the <provider> within the <private-name>.  An <alert-
   label> that follows a <private-name> is defined by the organization



Liess, et al.           Expires January 12, 2014               [Page 25]

Internet-Draft                 Alert URNs                      July 2013


   determined by the <provider> within the <private-name>.

   The organization determined by a <provider> is the organization that
   was the registered owner of the contained <provider-id> (which is a
   fully-qualified domain name) on the given date <date> (interpreted
   according to the following default rules).  If the <date> is omitted,
   it defaults to "2013-01-01".  If the century part <CC> is omitted, it
   defaults to "20".  If the month part <MM> or the day part <DD> is
   omitted, it defaults to "01".  In addition, if an organization is the
   first registrant of a domain name (over all time), it may use any
   <date> preceding when it registered the domain name.

   More specifically: On every date on which an organization is the
   registered owner of a domain name, the organization acquires an
   intellectual property right to define the meaning of <private-name>s
   and <alert-label>s that are governed by a <provider> value specifying
   that domain name and that date (directly or by defaults).  If an
   organization is the first registrant of a domain name, on the date it
   obtains the registration, it also acquires those rights for all
   <provider> values specifying that domain name and any date before the
   date of registration.  Unless otherwise arranged, these intellectual
   property rights transfer if the organization transfers the right to
   use the domain name.  However, if the organization's registration
   expires and another organization acquires registration of the domain
   name de novo, the first organization retains the <provider> rights
   that it possessed regarding that domain name.

7.4.  Examples

7.4.1.  Subsetting an existing URN

   A company owning the domain name somecompany.example.com can define
   distinctive versions of <urn:alert:service:call-waiting>:

      urn:alert:service:call-waiting:abc@somecompany.example.com
      urn:alert:service:call-waiting:def@somecompany.example.com

   It can create a more specialized URN that applies to a subset of the
   situations to which the first URN above applies:

      urn:alert:service:call-waiting:abc@somecompany.example.com:xyz

   Because "xyz" follows "abc@somecompany.example.com" (and there is no
   intervening <private-name>), its meaning is defined by the owner of
   the <provider> "somecompany.example.com" (whose implicit date is
   "2013-01-01").

7.4.2.  A new value within an <alert-category>

   A company owning the domain name somecompany.example.com can define
   URNs in the "service" category to express a new service that is not
   covered by any of the standardized URNs:

      urn:alert:service:ghi@somecompany.example.com

   However, before defining such a URN, the organization should verify
   that the set of calls to which the URN applies is not a subset of the
   set of calls for some existing URN.  If it is a subset, the extension
   URN should be a subdivision of the existing URN.

7.4.3.  A new <alert-category>

   A company owning the domain name somecompany.example.com can define
   an extension <alert-category> named "jkl@somecompany.example.com"
   with two values "a1" and "a2":

      urn:alert:jkl@somecompany.example.com:a1
      urn:alert:jkl@somecompany.example.com:a2

7.4.4.  Subsetting a private extension URN

   The company designated by "a.example.com(2013)" wants to define a set
   of URNs that specify the different ring patterns used by a
   "distinctive ring" service to alert for incoming calls that are
   directed to different directory numbers.  These ring patterns are
   composed of groups of ring sounds that have particular patterns of
   lengths.

   The company can create a private <alert-category>
   "distinctive@a.example.com", and within it assign three 'alert' URNs
   that indicate the three different ring patterns used by the company's
   service:

      urn:alert:distinctive@a.example.com:long-long
      urn:alert:distinctive@a.example.com:short-long-short
      urn:alert:distinctive@a.example.com:short-short-long

   Later, the company designated by "b.example.com(2013)" wants to
   define an additional 'alert' URN for the ring pattern "short short",
   which it uses to support a fourth directory number for a phone
   instrument.  The company can create a <private-name> to be used with
   the "distinctive@a.example.com" <alert-category>:

7.4.5.  Default <date>s

   The United States Army has had possession of the domain name
   "army.mil" since at least 1990.  Thus, it can use the following
   <provider> values (among many others):

    army.mil(1990)
    army.mil(2013-03)
    army.mil(2013-03-29)

   It can also use the following <provider> values, which all have the
   same meaning:

    army.mil
    army.mil(13)
    army.mil(13-01)
    army.mil(13-01-01)
    army.mil(2013)
    army.mil(2013-01)
    army.mil(2013-01-01)

   (Note that per Section 4 , an organization SHOULD use only one
   <provider> value for all of the <private-name>s it defines.)


8.  Combinations of "alert " URNs

8.1.  Priority Rules

   This section describes combination rules for the case when all the
   Alert-Info header fields only contain "alert" URNs.  Other
   combinations of URIs in the Alert-Info header fields of the same SIP
   message are not defined in this specification.

   In many cases, more than one URN will be needed to fully define a
   particular tone.  This is done by including multiple "alert" URNs, in
   one or more Alert-Info header fields in a request or a response.  For
   example, an internal, priority call could be indicated by Alert-Info:
   <urn:alert:source:internal>, <urn:alert:priority:high> A priority
   call waiting tone could be indicated by Alert-Info:
   <urn:alert:service:call-waiting>, <urn:alert:priority:high>

   The sender of the Alert-Info header field may include an arbitrary
   list of "alert" URNs, even if they are redundant or contradictory.
   An earlier URN has priority over any later contradictory URN.  This
   allows any element to modify a list of URNs to require a feature

   value (by adding a URN at the beginning of the list) or to suggest a
   feature value (by adding a URN at the end of the list).

   The receiving UA matches the received "alert" URN combination with
   the signal(s) it is able to render.

   The implementation is free to ignore an "alert" URN if it does not
   recognize the URN, or if it is incapable of rendering its effect in
   the context.  Similarly, it can remove a final series of one or more
   <alert-ind-part>s of an "alert" URN to create a "more generic" URN
   which it recognizes and whose meaning it can render in the context.

   The exact way in which a UA renders a received combination of "alert"
   URNs is left as an implementation issue.  However, the implementation
   MUST comply to following rules:

      a.  Each "alert" URN has precedence over all URNs that follow it,
      and its interpretation is subordinate to all URNs that precede it.

      b.  If the UA cannot implement the effect of a URN (because it
      does not recognize the URN or the URN's effect is precluded by
      preceding URNs), the UA repeatedly removes the final <alert-ind-
      part> of the URN until either

         (i) the resulting URN is recognized and can be given effect by
         some signal (without reducing the degree of expression of any
         preceding URN), or

         (ii) the resulting URN is reduced to having no <alert-ind-part>
         in which case, that URN in the series cannot be given effect,
         and so is ignored.

      c.  In case that after processing all the received URNs, the UA
      can generate more than one signal that are equally effective at
      expressing the URNs (under the preceding rules), one of those
      signals is selected.  When selecting from the set of equally
      effective signals, no signal should be chosen if a less-specific
      signal is also in the set.  (Specificity is to be judged based on
      the defined meanings of the signals to the user.)  (E.g., if each
      signal is considered to express certain <alert-indication>s of
      certain <alert-categories>, one signal is less-specific than a
      second signal if the first signal's <alert-indication>s are a
      subset or are prefixes of the second signal's <alert-
      indication>s.)  However, a more-specific signal may be chosen if
      the choice is based on information derived from the containing SIP
      message.  E.g., a signal implying <urn:alert:priority:high> may be
      chosen if the SIP message contains the header field "Priority:
      urgent".

Internet-Draft                 Alert URNs                      July 2013


   In all situations, the set of signals that can be rendered and their
   significances may change based on user preferences and local policy.

   In addition, the chosen signal may change based on the status of the
   UA.  E.g., if a call is active on the UA, all audible signals may
   become unavailable, or audible signals may be available only if
   <urn:alert:priority:high> is specified.

8.2.  Multi-mode signals

   There are cases when the device can render two signal modes (e.g.,
   audio and visual, or video or text) at the same time.

   Formally, the device must be considered as making its choice from the
   set of all combined signals that it can render (pairs of one signal
   from the first mode and one signal from the second mode), and that
   choice must conform to the above rules.  However, it can be proven
   that if the device makes its rendering choice for each of the two
   modes independently, with each choice separately conforming to the
   above rules, its combined choice conforms to the above rules, when it
   is regarded as a choice from among all possible combinations.

   In such a situation, it may simplify implementation to make each
   choice separately.  It is an implementation decision whether to chose
   from among combined signals, or to combine choices made from each
   signal mode.


9.  Non-normative Algorithm for Handling Combinations of URNs

   The following text is a non-normative example of an algorithm for
   handling combinations of URNs that complies with the rules in
   Section 7 and Section 8.  Thus, it demonstrates that the rules are
   consistent and implementable.  (Of course, a device may use any other
   algorithm which complies with Section 7 and Section 8.)

9.1.   Algorithm Description

   For each <alert-category> (feature) known by the implementation,
   there is a "feature tree" of the known <alert-indication>s for that
   <alert-category>, with the sequence of <alert-ind-part>s in an
   <alert-indication> specifying the path in the tree from the root to
   the node representing the <alert-indication>.  For this description,
   we will name each tree and its root node by the <alert-category>
   name, and name each non-root node by the <alert-identifier>.  Each
   URN thus corresponds to one non-root node in one feature tree.  For
   example, there is a tree named "source", whose root node is also
   named "source", and which has the children source:internal, source:



Liess, et al.           Expires January 12, 2014               [Page 30]

Internet-Draft                 Alert URNs                      July 2013


   external, source:friend, and source:family.  The URN
   <urn:alert:source:external> is placed at the node "source:external"
   in the "source" tree.  If the implementation understands
   <urn:alert:source:foo@example.com>, there is a node
   source:foo@example.com that is a child of node "source".  If the
   implementation understands
   <urn:alert:source:external:bar@example.com>, there is a node
   source:external:bar@example.com that is a child of node source:
   external.  (Of course, there are an infinite number of potential
   additional nodes in the tree for private values, but we don't have to
   represent those nodes explicitly unless the device has a signal
   representing the private value.)

   We assign similar locations to signals, but each signal has a
   position in *every* tree, describing the specific combination of
   meanings that it carries.  If a signal has a simple meaning, such as
   "external source", its place in the "source" tree is source:external,
   showing that it carries the "external source" meaning, but its place
   in every other feature tree is at the root node, meaning that it has
   no particular meaning for those features.

   A signal that has a complex meaning may have non-root positions in
   more than one feature tree.  For example, an "external, high
   priority" signal would be placed at source:external and priority:high
   in those trees, but be at the root in all other feature trees.

   In order to assure that the algorithm always selects at least one
   signal, we require that there is a "default" signal, whose position
   in every feature tree is at the root.  This default signal will never
   be excluded from the set of acceptable signals for any set of URNs,
   but will be the lowest-priority signal for any set of URNs.

   The algorithm proceeds by considering each URN in the received Alert-
   Info header fields from left to right, while revising a set of
   signals.  The set of signals starts as the entire set of signals
   available to the device.  Each URN excludes some signals from the
   set, and *sorts* the signals that remain in the set according to how
   well they represent the URN.  (The details of these operations are
   described below.)  The first URN is the "major sort", and has the
   most influence on the position of a signal in the set.  The second
   URN is a "minor sort", in that it arranges the orders of the signals
   that are tied within the first sort, the third URN arranges the
   orders of the signals that are tied within the first two sorts, etc.

   At the end of the algorithm, a final, "most minor" sort is done,
   which orders the signals which remain tied under all the sorts driven
   by the URNs.  This final sort places the least specific signals
   (within their tied groups) *first*.  (If one signal's position in



Liess, et al.           Expires January 12, 2014               [Page 31]

Internet-Draft                 Alert URNs                      July 2013


   each feature tree is ancestral or the same as a second signal's
   position in that tree, the first signal is "less specific" than the
   second signal.  Other cases are left to the implementation to
   decide.)

   Once all the URNs are processed and the sorting of the signals that
   have not been excluded is done, the device selects the first signal
   in the set.

   Here is how a single sort step proceeds, examining a single URN to
   modify the set of signals (by excluding some signals and further
   sorting the signals that remain):

   o  The URN specifies a specific node in a specific feature tree.
   o  All signals in the set that are, within that feature tree,
      positioned at the URN's node, or at an ancestor node of the URN's
      node, are kept.  All other signals are removed from the set
      (because they have meanings that are incompatible with the URN's
      meaning).
   o  Each group of signals that are tied under the previous sorts are
      further sorted into groups based on how much of the URN's meaning
      they represent: those which are positioned at the node of the URN
      are tied for first position, those which are positioned at the
      parent node of the URN are tied for second position, etc., and
      those which are positioned at the root node of the feature tree
      are tied for last position.

9.2.  Examples of how the algorithm works

   The following examples show how the algorithm described in the
   previous section works:

9.2.1.  Example 1

   The device has a set of 4 alerting signals.  We list their primary
   meanings, and the locations that they are placed in the feature
   trees:

   Signal 1

      Meaning: external
      Locations:
      - source:external
      - priority (that is, the root node of the priority tree)

   Signal 2

Internet-Draft                 Alert URNs                      July 2013


      Meaning: internal
      Locations:
      - source:internal
      - priority

   Signal 3

      Meaning: low
      Locations:
      - source
      - priority:low

   Signal 4

      Meaning: high
      Locations:
      - source
      - priority:high

   To which we add:

   Signal 5

      Meaning: default
      Locations:
      - source
      - priority

   If the device receives <urn:alert:source:internal>, then the sort is:

   Signals at source:internal: (this is, first place)

      urn:alert:source:internal

   Signals at source: (tied for second place)

      urn:alert:priority:low
      urn:alert:priority:high
      default

   And these signals are excluded from the set:

      urn:alert:source:external

   So in this example, the sorting algorithm properly gives first place
   to <urn:alert:source:internal>.

9.2.2.  Example 2

   Let us add to the set of signals in Example 1 ones that express
   combinations like "internal, high priority", but let us specifically
   exclude the combination "internal, low priority" so as to set up some
   tricky examples.  This enlarges our set of signals:

   Signal 1

      Meaning: default
      Locations:
      - source
      - priority

   Signal 2

      Meaning: external
      Locations:
      - source:external
      - priority

   Signal 3

      Meaning: internal
      Locations:
      - source:internal
      - priority

   Signal 4

      Meaning: low
      Locations:
      - source
      - priority:low

   Signal 5

      Meaning: high
      Locations:
      - source
      - priority:high

   Signal 6

      Meaning: external high
      Locations:

      - source:external
      - priority:high

   Signal 7

      Meaning: external low
      Locations:
      - source:external
      - priority:low

   Signal 8

      Meaning: internal high
      Locations:
      - source:internal
      - priority:high

   If the device receives <urn:alert:source:internal>, then the sort is:

   Signals at source:internal: (that is, tied for first place)

      - internal
      - internal high

   Signals at source: (tied for second place)

      - low
      - high
      - default

   Signals excluded from the set:

      - external
      - external low
      - external high

   Two signals are tied for the first place, but the final sort orders
   them:

      - internal
      - internal high

   because it puts the least-specific signal first.  So the signal
   "internal" is chosen.

9.2.3.  Example 3

   The same device receives <urn:alert:source:external>,
   <urn:alert:priority:low>.  The first sort (due to
   <urn:alert:source:external>) is:

   Signals at source:external:

      - external
      - external low
      - external high

   Signals at source:

      - low
      - high
      - default

   Signals excluded:

      - internal
      - internal high

   The second sort (due to <urn:alert:priority:low>) puts signals at
   priority:low before signals at priority, and excludes signal at
   priority:high:

      - external low
      - external
      - low
      - default

   Excluded:

      - external high
      - high
      - internal
      - internal high

   So, we choose "external low".

9.2.4.  Example 4

   Suppose the same device receives <urn:alert:source:internal>,
   <urn:alert:priority:low>.  Note that there is no signal that
   corresponds to this combination.

   The first sort is based on source:internal, and results in this

   order:

      - internal
      - internal high
      - low
      - high
      - default

   Excluded:

      - external
      - external low
      - external high

   The second sort is based on priority:low, and results in this order:

      - internal
      - low
      - default

   Excluded:

      - internal high
      - high
      - external low
      - external
      - external high

   So we choose the signal "internal".

9.2.5.  Example 5

   Let us set up a simple set of signals, with three signals giving
   priority:

   Signal 1

      Meaning: default
      Locations:
      - priority

   Signal 2

      Meaning: low
      Locations:
      - priority:low

   Signal 3

Internet-Draft                 Alert URNs                      July 2013


      Meaning: high
      Locations:
      - priority:high

   Notice that we've used the "default" signal to cover "normal
   priority".  That is so the signal will cover situations where no
   priority URN is present, as well as the ones with
   <urn:alert:priority:normal>.  So we're deliberately failing to
   distinguish "priority:normal" from the default priority.

   If the device receives <urn:alert:priority:low>, the sort is:

      - low
      - default

   Excluded:

      - high

   and signal "low" is chosen.

   Similarly, if the device receives <urn:alert:priority:high>, signal
   "high" is chosen.

   If the device receives <urn:alert:priority:normal>, the sort is:

      - default

   Excluded:

      - low
      - high

   and signal "default" is chosen.

   If no "priority" URN is received, "default" will be put before "low"
   and "high" by the final sort, and so it will be chosen.


10.  User Agent Behaviour

   A SIP UA MAY add a URN or multiple URNs to the Alert-Info header
   field in a SIP request or a provisional 1xx response (excepting a 100
   response) when it needs to provide additional information about the
   call or about the provided service.

   Upon receiving a SIP INVITE request or a SIP provisional response
   with an Alert-Info header field that contains a combination of Alert-

Internet-Draft                 Alert URNs                      July 2013


   Info URNs, the User Agent (UA) attempts to match the received Alert-
   Info URNs combination with a signal it can render.  The process the
   UA uses MUST conform to the rules described in Section 8.  (A non-
   normative algorithm example for the process is described in
   Section 9.)

   The User Agent (UA) MUST produce a reasonable rendering regardless of
   the combination of URIs (of any schemes) in the Alert-Info header
   field.


11.  Proxy Behaviour

   A SIP proxy MAY add a URN or multiple URNs to the Alert-Info header
   field in a SIP request or a provisional 1xx response (excepting a 100
   response) when it needs to provide additional information about the
   call or about the provided service.

   The following example shows a typical example of a 180 Ringing
   provisional response that has been modified by a proxy.  The response
   sent by the UAS to the proxy was very similar, but had no Alert-Info
   header field.  The proxy has added Alert-Info header field values
   specifying both a network audio resource referenced by the HTTP URI
   and the URN indication for the call-waiting service.  This allows the
   UAC to render the network audio resource, or to choose a rendering
   based on the URN, or to perform some combination of these actions.
   Due to section 10, the UAC must produce some reasonable rendering in
   this situation.

12.  Internationalization Considerations

   The <alert-identifier> labels are protocol elements [RFC6365] and are
   not normally seen by users.  Thus, the character set for these
   elements is restricted, as described in Section 6.

Internet-Draft                 Alert URNs                      July 2013


   The URNs <urn:alert:locale:country:<ISO 3166-1 country code>> select
   renderings that are conventional in the specified country.

   Domain names that appear as parts of "alert" URNs can be
   internationalized, in that they can contain A-labels.


13.  Security Considerations

   As an identifier, the alert URN does not appear to raise any
   particular security issues.  The indications described by the "alert"
   URN are meant to be well-known.

   However, the provision of specific indications may raise privacy
   issues, e.g. indications about the source of the message or about
   services initiated at the other side.  Such provision SHALL always be
   explicitly authorised by the party (caller or callee) the information
   in the "alert" URN refers to.

   Proxies may choose to suppress undesired indications, e.g. from
   untrusted sources, while allowing them from trusted sources.
