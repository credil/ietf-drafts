                       draft-meng-behave-napgt-01

Abstract

   Currently, if an internal server and hosts are behind NAT, they
   cannot share a global IP address except adding lots of static NAPT
   rule configuration.  Because if a server wants to provide a service
   by constant port(i.e. HTTP and FTP) , the destination port of packet
   sent by an external client should not be changed when it crosses NAT.
   This document specifies a new method to assign NAPT global address
   and port, aiming to solve the problem that internal servers and hosts
   cannot share less global IP addresses.

1.  Introduction

   With the depletion of IPv4 addresses, many operators have begun to
   deploy NAPT in their network.  However, the use of NAPT has many
   shortcomings.  For example, a server is placed in an internal
   network, this may happen when an external client attempts to access a
   server in the internal network through HTTP.  Dynamic NAPT cannot be
   used for translation except for NAT, because the translation MUST
   keep the consistency of the internal port and external port (PORT:80
   should not be changed).  This may be causing a public IP address
   being occupied to a server, but not for other users to access,
   resulting in a misuse of resources.

   It appears that STATIC NAPT is a near-perfect solution to deal with
   this issue.  However, However, if there are a lot of services or
   servers in the internal network, it may not be useful to configure a
   huge number of STATIC NAPT rules.  This will increase the complexity
   of configuration without a corresponding increase in functionality.

   The current existing solution works by changing the configuration due
   to user complaints.  A user does not know whether his/her IP address
   is global or local.  During the use of a global IP address, he/she
   can access the server placed in his home from external.  Until one
   day, he/she cannot do that because he/she gets a local IP address.
   He/She is not satisfied and complains to the operator.  Operator has
   to assign global IP address for him/her and still assign local IP
   address for others.  Operator distinguishes him/her from others by
   embedding tags into the subscriber backend database.

   Now, through the variant of traditional NAPT translation, we can
   achieve sharing a global IP address among a server and hosts placed
   in the same internal network.  It is called NAPGT (Network Address
   Port Group Translator).

2.  Convention and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Scenarios

   There can be a typical scenario if NAT is involved.

   In this scenario, a server and several hosts are behind NAT.  NAT has
   only a global IP address.  NAT needs to let client access to server
   without affecting any hosts accessing to the internet.


                                           Address Pool:
                                           {202.1.1.1 }

                                                          +--------+

4.  Configuration

   The NAPGT needs to be configured in a NAT device.  Port-ranges MUST
   be specified in NAT pool, such as '1-1024','7000-7100'.  It means
   that a collection of ports MUST be utilized for binding.  The rest of
   ports can be assigned to hosts.

   Static or dynamic rules MUST be configured for server.  Rules for
   hosts has no special requirement.

5.  Mapping Item

   To achieve client accessing server behind NAT by HTTP or FTP, mapping
   item MUST be generated in advance.
