Internet-Draft         List-Sequence header field          February 2012


1.  Introduction

   The List-Sequence header field provides a standard location for a
   sequence identifier identifying the sequence position of an
   individual message for a mailing list.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Syntax Notation

   This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   [RFC5234] notation for the formal definitions of the syntax of list
   header fields.

1.3.  Note

   This Internet-Draft can be discussed on the apps-discuss@ietf.org
   mailing list.  [RFC-Editor: please remove this paragraph]


2.  List-Sequence Header Field

   The List-Sequence header field provides a Sequence Identifier for
   each message sent to a mailing list.  While this is often expressed
   as an integer, it is not constrained to be so.  Nor is it constrained
   to fit into a 31- or 32-bit integer when it is an integral value.
   The Sequence Identifier SHOULD be unique within a mailing list.
   There MUST NOT be more than one List-Sequence header field in any
   given message.

   Syntax:

      seq-id = 1*atext

      list-sequence = "List-Sequence:" seq-id CRLF

   Examples:



      List-Sequence:  5

      List-Sequence:  S25


3.  Security Considerations

   If a mailing list manager encounters a List-Sequence header fields
   from any unexpected source it SHOULD NOT pass them through to the
   mailing list.


4.  IANA Considerations

   The following is the registration template to add the List-Sequence
   header field to the Permanent Message Header Field Names registry:

      Header field name: List-Sequence

      Applicable protocol: mail ([RFC5322])

      Status: Standard

      Author/Change controller: IETF

      Specification document(s): RFC XXXX [RFC Editor: please replace
      XXXX with this RFC number]

   and contributed to this document.
