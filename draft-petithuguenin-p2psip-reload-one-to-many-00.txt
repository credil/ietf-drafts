Internet-Draft         One-To-Many Bootstrap Nodes          January 2013


1.  Introduction

   RELOAD [I-D.ietf-p2psip-base] explains that to join an overlay a node
   must, if the bootstrap node cache is empty, contact one of the
   bootstrap peers listed in a <bootstrap-node> element of the
   configuration document.  The process described works only with
   unicast addresses, as TCP - and so TLS - is not supported with
   anything else than unicast addresses, and DTLS does not work at all
   with multicast or broadcast addresses, and will be unreliable with
   anycast addresses.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST" and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted
   as described in [RFC2119].

   One-to-many Address:  An Anycast, Multicast or Broadcast IP address.


3.  Searching for Bootstrap Node

   An overlay that runs one or more bootstrap node over a one-to-many
   address MUST add a <bootstrap-node> element for each of them in the
   configuration document, using the XML namespace designating them as
   such.  The same configuration document MAY also contain unicast
   <bootstrap-node> elements to let nodes that do not implement this
   specification join the overlay.

   The RELAX NG grammar for the one-to-many <bootstrap-node> element is
   as follow.  Whitespace and case processing MUST follow the rules of
   [OASIS.relax_ng] and XML Schema Datatypes
   [W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028].

   namespace otm = "http://implementers.org/reload-one-to-many"

   parameter &= element otm:bootstrap-node {
       attribute address {  xsd:string },
       attribute port { xsd:int }?
   }*

   The <bootstrap-node> element has an attribute called "address" that
   contains an IPv4 or IPv6 address and an optional attribute called
   "port" that represents the port and defaults to 6084.  The IPv6
   address MUST use the hexadecimal form using standard period and colon
   separators as specified in [RFC5952].  More than one "bootstrap-node"
   element MAY be present.

Internet-Draft         One-To-Many Bootstrap Nodes          January 2013


   Instead of the bootstrap node, a STUN [RFC5389] server implementing
   the ALTERNATE-SERVER Mechanism (Section 11) MUST run on the one-to-
   many address.  The STUN server only serves Binding Request and the
   ALTERNATE-SERVER attribute returned MUST contain the unicast address
   and the port of a bootstrap node.  Credentials MUST NOT be required
   by the STUN server.

   If no cached bootstrap nodes are available, a joining node that
   implements this specification MUST first try to join the bootstrap
   nodes designated as listening on a one-to-many address.  If trying to
   contact all the one-to-many addresses fails, the joining node MUST
   try the eventual unicast bootstrap nodes listed in the configuration
   document.  The joining node MUST send a STUN Binding Request to one
   of the one-to-many addresses, chosen randomly.  Any response other
   than a 300 will put the one-to-many address in a blacklist for 3
   minutes, and the joining node MUST try the next one-to-many address.
   The IP address and port returned in a 300 response MUST be used as if
   a unicast bootstrap address was retrieved from the configuration
   file, and MAY be cached the same way a unicast bootstrap node address
   is cached.

   As a consequence of this design, a bootstrap node running on a
   unicast address do not have to listen for other protocols than the
   Overlay Link protocols defined in RELOAD.  A client that need to know
   the Node-ID of the bootstrap node can send a Probe or Ping request
   over DTLS-UDP-SR, TLS-TCP-FH-NO-ICE or DTLS-UDP-SR-NO-ICE with a
   destination list containing a single wildcard Node-ID.  After this,
   the standard process to join the overlay described in
   [I-D.ietf-p2psip-base] can be used.

6.  IANA Considerations

   If this document is accepted as a standard track document this
   section will request a URN in the "XML Namespaces" class of the "IETF
   XML Registry" from IANA.  Until this is done, implementions should
   use the following URN:

Appendix A.  Example

   The following example shows that an anycast address and a multicast
   address can be used to find a bootstrap node.  A joining node that
   does not recognize the extension can still join the overlay by using
   the unicast addresses.
