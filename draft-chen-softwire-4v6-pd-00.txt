Abstract

   This draft presents the investigation of 4via6 in the scenario where
   IPv6 prefix delegation is deployed.  A practicable application
   scenarios with IPv6 prefix delegation have been introduced in the
   mobile network environments.  The applicability of 4via6 mechnism has
   been analyzed in term of mapping rules and 4via6 address structure.
   Targeting to alignment with existing 4via6 mapping algorithm and
   RFC6052 recommendation, an alternative 4via6 address structure have
   been proposed to be capable of assigning flexible address/port set to
   4via6 domains.

Internet-Draft          Prefix Delegation in 4V6             August 2011


1.  Introduction

   With the fast development of global Internet, the demands for IP
   address are rapidly increasing currently.  This year, IANA announced
   that the global free pool of IPv4 depleted on 3 February.  IPv6 is
   the only real option on the table.  Operators have to accelerate the
   process of deploying IPv6 networks in order to address IP address
   strains.

   IPv6 deployment normally involves a step-wise approach where parts of
   the network should properly updated gradually.  As IPv6 deployment
   progresses it may be simpler for operators to employ a single-version
   network, since deploying both IPv4 and IPv6 in parallel would costs
   more than IPv6-only network.  Therefore switching to an IPv6-only
   network will become more prevalent.  Meanwhile, a significant part of
   network will still stay in IPv4 for long time.  There may not be
   enough public or private IPv4 addresses to support end-to-end network
   communication, without segmenting the network into small parts with
   sharing one IPv4 address space.  Operators have to choose a IPv6
   transition technology to bridge these IPv4 islands through IPv6
   network.

   Currently, 4via6 stateless became a essential topic which motivates
   IETF community taking efforts to advance the
   work[I-D.operators-softwire-stateless-4v6-motivation].
   Encapsulation/decapsulation solution[I-D.murakami-softwire-4rd] and
   translation solution[I-D.murakami-softwire-4v6-translation] have been
   proposed to fit into the solution set.  The flexibilities of 4via6
   mapping algorithm allow the variable length of IPv6 prefix assigned
   to CE for deriving IPv4 information.  This also could facilitate the
   IPv6 prefix delegation implementation in the mobile environments.
   The memo would discuss the applicability of 4via6 with pd mechanism.
   Some observations for use scenarioes, mapping rules and 4via6
   structure have been described in the following sections.


2.  Scenario

   This section describes the scenario of prefix delegation used in
   mobile network.  The architecture is depicted in Figure 1.  Prefix
   delegation is introduced in 3GPP network in Release 10.  A UE (CPE)
   obtains IPv6 prefix from the mobile network.  It then initiates
   DHCPv6 for prefix delegation.

         Figure 1: 4V6 UE perfoms as a CPE with prefix delegation

   There are two phases for a 4V6 UE/CPE performs prefix delegation
   function.  For the first phase, the 4V6 UE/CPE attaches to the LTE
   network.  The network provides the UE with IPv6 only connection and
   the UE obtains a /64 4V6 prefix.  For the second phase, the 4V6 UE/
   CPE initiate prefix delegation procedure.  The network assign a
   prefix shorter than 64 to the 4V6 UE/CPE.  Figure 1 shows a case that
   a /56 is assigned to UE/CEP during prefix delegation.

   There may be three possible cases for a 4V6 UE performing as a CPE.
   As shown in Figure 1 It privdes IPv4 only, IPv6 only or IPv6 and IPv4
   connection to IP devices depicted as H1, H2 and H3.  The 4V6 UE/CPE
   may implement a internal NAT44 to provide IPv4 connectin for multiple
   IP devices.  The IP devices get /64 prefix from 4V6 UE/CPE through
   RS/RA.  Such a /64 prefix is generated from the prefix assigned by
   the network through prefix delegation.


3.  Applicability: Mapping Rules and Address Structure

   In order to simplify PD implementation, 4via6 stateless should allow
   a IPv6 prefix with variable length delegated to 4via6 CE for deriving
   IPv4 address. 4via6 stateless mapping rules specified in

Internet-Draft          Prefix Delegation in 4V6             August 2011


   [I-D.murakami-softwire-4rd] and [I-D.despres-softwire-4rd-addmapping]
   have naturally supported that, in which a variable length field
   inserting port index information has allowed encoded in the top 64
   bits of IPv6 prefix.  With different size of granted port space
   assigned to customers, IPv6 prefix with shorter than 64bits length
   could be produced. 4via6 CE could be delegated with the IPv6 prefix
   for potential 4via6 stateless computations.

   In some cases, operators may require an ability to assign address/
   port sets of different sizes to different classes of customers
   according dynamic traffic model.  Current mapping rule could provide
   such capacities by linking to different lengths of delegated IPv6
   prefixes.  The below has proposed alternative one, which could
   compatible with the address structure defined in
   [I-D.murakami-softwire-4rd], also could follow the recommendation in
   [RFC6052].

              |IPv6 prefix |Add set|Port set|zero | u |   v4   |zero|
              +---------------------------- ------+---+--------+----+



                       Figure 2: 4via6-pd structure

   Followings provide the desriptions for each field:

   o  IPv6 prefix

   An IPv6 prefix assigned by an ISP to a 4via6 domain.

   o  Add set

   The length of Add set is (32-IPv4 prefix length)long.  The purpose of
   the field is used to determine how many IPv4 address assigned to
   customers connecting a given CE.  It could be a IPv4 subnet or a
   shared IPv4 address according to padding bits.  Specifically, IPv4
   subnet will be identified by the suffix of zero.

   o  Port set

   Port set indicates the size of granted port space.  The length is
   determined by multiplexing ratio, which is shown in the table
   [I-D.sun-intarea-4rd-applicability].  Also, the bits in the port set
   field would serve for identifying a specific 4via6 CE.

                        Figure 3: 4via6-pd port set

   o  IPv4 Prefix

   The preconfigured IPv4 prefix would be encoded in the last 64 bits,
   which is following the recommendation in RFC6035.

   o  Delegated IPv6 Prefix

   The delegated IPv6 prefix would be determined through the below
   formula.

   Delegated IPv6 prefix = IPv6 prefix + Add set + Port set

   Therein, the field of (Add set+ Port set) is compatible with EA bits
   in [I-D.murakami-softwire-4rd].  The additional gains here are to
   provide the possibilities of assigning several shared IPv4 address in
   a given CE domain.


4.  Other Considerations

   The total IPv6 address space available for the PDN connection (UE/CPE
   4V6 prefix and the delegated IPv6 prefix) shall be possible to
   aggregate into one IPv6 prefix that will represent all IPv6 addresses
   that the UE may use.  If the UE/CPE indicates that it supports prefix

   exclusion and the prefix to be delegated to the UE/CPE includes the
   /64 prefix that was allocated as the 4V6 prefix, the network shall
   utilise the prefix exclusion feature for DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation.
