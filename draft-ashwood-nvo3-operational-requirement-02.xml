    <abstract>
      <t>This document provides framework and requirements for Network 
      Virtualization over Layer 3 (NVO3) Operations, Administration, 
      and Maintenance (OAM). This document for the most part gathers 
      requirements from existing IETF drafts and RFCs which have 
      already extensively studied this subject for different data 
      planes and layering. As a result this draft is high level and 
      broad. We begin to ask which are truly required for NVO3 and 
      expect the list to be narrowed by the working group as 
      subsequent versions of this draft are created.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>This document provides framework and requirements for Network 
      virtualization over Layer 3(NVO3) Operation, Administration, 
      and Maintenance (OAM). Given that this OAM subject is far from 
      new and has been under extensive investigation by various IETF 
      working groups (and several other standards bodies) for many 
      years, this document draws from existing work, starting with 
      <xref target="RFC6136"/>. As a result, sections of 
      <xref target="RFC6136"/> have been reused 
      with minor changes with the permission of the authors. </t> 

      <t>NVO3 OAM requirements are expected to be a subset of 
      IETF/IEEE etc. work done so far; however, we begin with a full 
      set of requirements and expect to prune them through several
      iterations of this document. </t>

      <section title="OSI Definitions of OAM" anchor="OSIdef">

        <t>The scope of OAM for any service and/or transport/network 
        infrastructure technologies can be very broad in nature. OSI 
        has defined the following five generic functional areas 
        commonly abbreviated as "FCAPS" [NM-Standards]: 
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Fault Management,</t>

          <t>Configuration Management,</t> 

          <t>Accounting Management,</t>  

          <t>Performance Management, and</t>  

          <t>Security Management.</t>
        </list>
        </t> 

        <t>This document focuses on the Fault, Performance and to a
	limited extent the Configuration Management aspects. Other 
        functional aspects of FCAPS and their relevance (or not) to
        NVO3 are for further study.</t> 

        <t>Fault Management can typically be viewed in terms of the 
        following categories:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Fault Detection</t> 

          <t>Fault Verification</t>        
          
          <t>Fault Isolation</t> 

          <t>Fault Notification and Alarm Suppression</t> 

          <t>Fault Recovery</t>
        </list>
        </t>

        <t>Fault detection deals with mechanism(s) that can detect 
        both hard failures such as link and device failures, and soft 
        failures, such as software failure, memory corruption, 
        misconfiguration, etc.Fault detection relies upon a set of mechanisms
        that first allow the observation of an event, then the use of a protocol 
        to dynamically notify a network/system operator (or management system) 
        about the event occurrence, then diagnosis tools to assess the nature 
        and the gravity of the fault.</t>
        
        <t>After verifying that a fault has occurred along the data path,
        it is important to be able to isolate the fault to the level 
        of a given device or link. Therefore, a fault isolation
        mechanism is needed in Fault Management. A fault notification
        mechanism should be used in conjunction with a fault detection mechanism to
        notify the devices upstream and downstream to the fault
        detection point. The fault notification mechanism should also notify NMS
        systems.</t>
        
        <t>For example, when there is a client/server relationship between two
        layered networks (for example the NVO3 layer would be a client of the
        outer IP server layer) while the inner IP layer would be a client of
        the NVO3 server layer 2); fault detection at the server layer may
        result in the following fault notifications:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Sending a forward fault notification from the server 
          layer to the client layer network(s) using the fault 
          notification format appropriate to the client layer.</t>

          <t>Sending a backward fault notification at the server 
          layer, if applicable, in the reverse direction.</t>

          <t>Sending a backward fault notification at the client
          layer, if applicable, in the reverse direction.</t>
        </list>
        </t>

        <t>Finally, fault recovery deals with recovering from the 
        detected failure by switching to an alternate available data
        path (depending on the nature of the fault) using alternate
        devices or links.</t>
        
        <t>Note, given that the IP network on which NVO3  resides is 
        usually self healing, it is expected that recovery would not
        normally be required by the NVO3 layer. The special case of a 
        static IP overlay network, or possibly a centrally controlled
        IP overlay network may however require NVO3 involvement in 
        fault recovery.</t>

        <t>Performance Management deals with mechanism(s) that allow 
        determining and measuring the performance of the 
        network/services under consideration. Performance Management 
        can be used to verify the compliance to both the service-level 
        and network-level metric objectives/specifications. 
        Performance Management typically consists of measuring
        performance metrics, e.g., Frame Loss, Frame Delay, Frame
        Delay Variation (aka Jitter), Frame throughput, Frame discard,
        etc., across managed entities 
        when the managed entities are in available state.
        Performance Management is suspended across unavailable 
        managed entities.</t>

      <t>L3 network(s) or L3 VPN networks (either IPv6 or IPv4, or

      The NV Edge devices then present an emulated layer 2 network to
      the Tenant End Systems at a Virtual Network Interface (VNI) 
      through Virtual Access Points (VAPs). The NV Edge devices map 
      layer 2 unicast to layer 3 unicast point-to-point tunnels and

        devices to which the Tenant End Systems are connected. This 
        network of NV Edges can be operated by a single service 
        provider or can span across multiple administrative domains. Likewise,
        the L3 Overlay Network can be operated by a single service
        provider or span across multiple administrative domains.</t>

        <t>While each of the layers is responsible for its own OAM,
        each layer may consist of several different administrative 
        domains. <xref target="fig3"/> shows an example.</t>

                                                       --- 

   TENANT    |----------------------------| TENANT {all IP/ETH} 
         
   NV Edge   |----------------------|  NV Edge     {t.b.d.} 
  
   IP(VPN)   |---| IP (VPN) |---| IP(VPN)          {IP(VPN)/ETH}
          </artwork>
        </figure> 

        <t>For example, at the bottom, at the L3 IP overlay network 
        layer IP(VPN) and/or Ethernet OAM mechanisms are used to probe
        link by link, node to node etc. OAM addressing here means
        physical node loopback or interface addresses.</t> 

        <t>Further up, at the NV Edge layer, NVO3 OAM messages are 
        used to probe the NV Edge to NV Edge tunnels and NV Edge 
        entity status. OAM addressing here likely means the physical
        node loopback together with the VNI (to de-multiplex the 
        tunnels).</t>  

        <t>Finally, at the Tenant layer, the IP and/or Ethernet OAM 
        mechanisms are again used but here they are operating over the 
        logical L2/L3 provided by the NV-Edge through the VAP. OAM 
        addressing at this layer deals with the logical interfaces on 
        Vswitches and Virtual Machines.

      <section title="OAM Domains">

        <t>Complex OAM relationships exist as a result of the 
        hierarchical layering of responsibility and of breaking up of
        end-to-end responsibility.</t> 

        <t>The OAM domain above NVO3, is expected to be supported by 
        existing IP and L2 OAM methods and tools.</t> 

        <t>The OAM domain below NVO3, is expected to be supported by 
        existing IP/L2 and MPLS OAM methods and tools. Where this 
        layer is actually multiple domains spliced together, the 
        existing methods to deal with these boundaries are unchanged.
	 Note however that exposing LAG/ECMP detailed behavior may 
	result in additional requirements to this domain, the deatils of
	which will be specified in the future versions of this draft.</t>

        <t>When we refer to an OAM domain in this document, or just 
        'domain', we therefore refer to a closed set        
        of NV Edges and the tunnels which interconnect them. Inter-domain 
	OAM considersations will be specified in the future versions of this
	draft.</t>

    <section title="NVO3 OAM Requirements">

      <t>The following numbered requirements originate from 
      <xref target="RFC6136"/>. All are included however where they 
      seem obviously not relevant (to the present authors) an 
      explanation as to why is included.</t>

      <section title="Discovery">

        <t>R1) NVO3 OAM MUST allow an NV Edge device to dynamically 
        discover other NV Edge devices that share the same VNI within
        a given NVO3 domain.</t>

        <section title="Connectivity Fault Detection">
          
          <t>R2) NVO3 OAM MUST allow proactive connectivity monitoring between
          two or more NV Edge devices that support the same VNIs within a given
          NVO3 domain. NVO3 OAM MAY act as a protection trigger. </t>  

          <t>R3) NVO3 OAM MUST allow monitoring/tracing of all possible paths
          between a specified set of two or more NV Edge devices. Using this
          feature, equal cost paths that traverse LAG and/or ECMP may be
          differentiated. </t>

          given NVO3 domain.</t> 

        </section>

        <section title="Connectivity Fault Notification and Alarm Suppression">

          <t>R6) NVO3 OAM MUST support fault notification to be 
          triggered as a result of the faults occured at the underneath network
          infrastructure.
          This fault notification SHOULD be used for the suppression 
          of redundant service-level alarms.</t>

      </section> <!-- Connect fault mgmt -->

      <section title="Frame Loss">

        <t>R7) NVO3 OAM MUST support measurement of per VNI frame/packet 
        loss between two NV Edge devices that support the same VNI 
        within a given NVO3 domain.</t> 

      </section>

      </section> 

      <section title="Frame Throughput"> 

        <t>R11) NVO3 OAM MAY support measurement of per VNI 
        frame/packet throughput between two NV Edge devices that
        support the same VNI within a given NVO3 domain. This feature
        MAY be effective to confirm whether or not assigned path 
        bandwise is conformed to service level aggreement before 
        providing the path between two NV Edge devices. </t>

        MAY be effective to monitor bursty traffic between two 
        NV Edge devices.</t> 

      </section> 

      <section title="Availability"> 

        <t>A service may be considered unavailable if the service
        frames/packets do not reach their intended destination (e.g.,
        connectivity is down) or the service is degraded (e.g., frame/packet
        loss and/or frame/packet delay and/or delay variation threshold is
        exceeded). Entry and exit conditions may be defined for the
        unavailable state. Availability itself may be defined in the context
        of a service type. Since availability measurement may be associated
        with connectivity, frame/packet loss, frame/packet delay, and
        frame/packet delay variation measurements, no additional requirements
        are specified currently. </t>

      </section> 

      <section title="Data Path Forwarding"> 

        <t>R13) NVO3 OAM frames MUST be forwarded along the same path 
        (i.e., links (including LAG members) and nodes) as the NVO3 
        data frames.</t> 

        <t>R14) NVO3 OAM frames MUST provide a mechanism to 
        exercise/trace all data paths that result due to ECMP/LAG 
        hops.
        </t>

      </section> 

      <section title="Scalability"> 

        <t>R15) NVO3 OAM MUST be scalable such that an NV edge device 
        can support proactive OAM for each VNI that is supported by 
        the device. (Note - Likely very hard to achieve with hash 
        based ECMP/LAG).</t>

      </section> 

      <section title="Extensibility"> 

        <t>R16) NVO3 OAM MUST be extensible such that new 
        functionality and information elements related to this 
        functionality can be introduced in the future.</t> 

        <t>R17) NVO3 OAM MUST be defined such that devices not 
        supporting the OAM are able to forward the OAM frames in a 
        similar fashion as the regular NVO3 data frames/packets.</t> 

      </section> 

      <section title="Security"> 

        <t>R18) NVO3 OAM frames MUST be prevented from leaking outside 
        their NVO3 domain.</t>  

        <t>R19) NVO3 OAM frames from outside an NVO3 domain MUST be 
        prevented from entering the said NVO3 domain when such OAM 
        frames belong to the same level or to a lower-level OAM. 
        (Trivially met because hierarchical domains are independent
        technologies.)
        </t>

        <t>R20) NVO3 OAM frames from outside an NVO3 domain MUST be 
        transported transparently inside the NVO3 domain when such OAM
        frames belong to a higher-level NVO3 domain. (Trivially met 
        because hierarchical domains are independent technologies).
        </t>

      </section> 

      <section title="Transport Independence"> 

        <t>Similar to transport requirement from 
        <xref target="RFC6136"/>, we expect NVO3 OAM will leverage the
        OAM capabilities of the transport layer (e.g., IP underlay).
        </t> 

        <t>R21) NVO3 OAM MAY allow adaptation/interworking with its IP 
        underlay OAM functions.  For example, this would be useful to 
        allow fault notifications from the IP layer to be sent to the 
        NVO3 layer and likewise exposure of LAG / ECMP will require 
        such non-independence.</t>

      </section> 

      <section title="Application Independence"> 

        <t>R22) NVO3 OAM MUST be independent of the application 
        technologies and specific application OAM capabilities.</t>

      </section>
      
      <section title="Prioritization">

        <t>R23) NVO3 OAM MUST be preferentially treated in NVE and between
        NVEs, since NVO3 OAM MAY be used to trigger protection switching.</t>

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>For global reachability purposes, inter-VNI communication

          infrastructure, coordinating OAM actions in each individual
          domain are required to ensure an e2e OAM. In particular, 
          this assumes existence of agreements on the measurement and
          monitoring methods, fault detection and repair actions, 
          extending QoS classes (e.g., DSCP mapping policies), etc.
