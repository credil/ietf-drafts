1.  Introduction

   The US Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is rolling out 
   their Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based architecture at this 
   time. This network will require two additional Resource-Priority 
   namespaces to complete that task. These two namespaces will be IANA 
   registered in accordance with RFC 4412 [RFC4412], and is analogous 
   to what was done within RFC 5478  [RFC5478].  The purpose of this 
   document is to register these additional namespaces.  

   DISA has a requirement to be able to assign different 
   Resource-Priority namespaces to differing groups of differing sizes 
   throughout their networks.  Examples of this may be 

   - namespaces as large as each branch of service (Army, Navy, Air 
     Force, Marines, Coast Guard) 

   - namespaces for some departments within the government (for 
     example, Homeland Security)

   - namespaces that are temporary assignments to individual units of 
     varying sizes (from battle groups to patrol groups or platoons) 

   These temporary assignments might be combinations of smaller units 
   involving several branches of service operating as one unit (say, 
   one task force, which is separate than the branch of service), or a 
   single commando unit requiring special treatment for a short period 
   of time, making it appear separate from the branch of service they 
   are from.

   Providing DISA with these two additional namespaces allows them the 
   flexibility they need for their mission requirements.  One can 
   imagine due to their sheer size and separation of purpose, they can 
   easily utilize a significant number of namespaces within their 
   networks.  

   This document makes no changes to SIP, it just adds IANA-registered 
   namespaces for SIP's use within the Resource-Priority header 
   framework.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  New SIP Resource-Priority Namespaces Created

   The new namespaces are case insensitive uc-xxxxxx and cuc-xxxxxx. 
   Each will be preemptive in nature, as defined in RFC 4412, and will 
   have the same 10 priority-values as those created in RFC 5478.

   Each namespace listed above is wholly different.  However, according 
   to the rules within Section 8 of RFC 4412, one or more sets can be 
   treated as if they are the same when they are configured as an 
   aggregated grouping of namespaces.

   These aggregates of two or more namespaces, which are to be 
   considered equivalent during treatment, can be a set of any IANA 
   registered namespaces, not just adjacent (i.e., consecutive) 
   namespaces.

   The two namespaces will have the same 10 priority levels:

      .0 (lowest priority)
      .1
      .2
      .3
      .4
      .5
      .6
      .7
      .8
      .9 (highest priority)

   The dash character ('-') is just like any other ASCII character 
   within a namespace, and is not to be considered a delimiter in any 
   official way within any namespace here.  Other namespace definitions 
   in the future could change this.

   As stated in Section 9 of RFC 4412 [RFC4412] an IANA-registered 
   namespace SHOULD NOT change the number, and MUST NOT change the 
   relative priority order of its assigned priority-values. These two 
   new namespaces comply with this requirement.

3.  IANA Considerations

   Abiding by the rules established within RFC 4412 [RFC4412], this is 
   a Standards-Track document registering new namespaces, their 
   associated priority-values, and intended algorithms.

3.1.  IANA Resource-Priority Namespace Registration

   Within the "Resource-Priority Namespaces" registry in the 
   sip-parameters section of IANA, the following table lists the new 
   namespaces registered by this document.


                        Intended     New warn-   New resp.
   Namespace   Levels   Algorithm      code        code     Reference
   ----------  ------  ------------  ---------   ---------  ---------
    uc-xxxxxx    10     preemption      no          no      [RFCxxxx]
   cuc-xxxxxx    10     preemption      no          no      [RFCxxxx]

   where RFC-xxxx is indicates this document, if it ever becomes an 
   RFC.


3.2.  IANA Priority-Value Registrations

   Within the "Resource-Priority Priority-values" registry in the 
   sip-parameters section of IANA, the list of priority-values for each 
   of the newly created namespaces from Section 3.1 of this 
   document, prioritized least to greatest, is registered by the 
   following (replicated similar to the following format): 

   Namespace: uc-xxxxxx
   Reference: RFCxxxx (this document)
   Priority-Values (least to greatest): "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", 
   "6", "7", "8", "9"

   Namespace: cuc-xxxxxx
   Reference: RFCxxxx (this document)
   Priority-Values (least to greatest): "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", 
   "6", "7", "8", "9"


4.  Security Considerations

   This document has the same Security Considerations as RFC 5478 
   [RFC5478].

5.  Acknowledgments

   There are no acknowledgements at this time, but could change on a 
   moment's notice.
