INTERNET DRAFT           New IP address format         February 23, 2012


1  Introduction

   This specification defines new addressing format and routing
   technique for the Internet Protocol (IP).

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2  Address Structure


   The addresses are 128 bits long and it is divided in to 8 levels.

   Hosts address bits are represented by Level 0.
   Network address bits are represented by Levels 1 through 7.

   2 bits are reserved for multicast.
   3 bits are reserved to mark the level.

   Level and bit representation are shown in the folloing:

3  Assign IP address

3.1  Router

   Routers MUST set its level and network address.

   For example:

   L3 200

   +----+----+----+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |  3 |    |    |    |     |     | 200 |     |     |     |
   +----+----+----+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

   where L3 is the level of the router and 200 is the network.


3.1.1  Assign IP addresses to interfaces

   The level of the interface is same as the level of router and the
   IP address must start with the network address of the router.
   Interfaces are categorized in to 3 according to the neighbor level.


   General format:

   Network:Host Level

   For example:
   200:281 L4

   +----+----+----+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |  4 |    |    |    |     |     | 200 |     |     | 281 |
   +----+----+----+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

   where 200 is the network, 281 is the interface address and L4 is the
   level of the neighbor.

   UPSTREAM interfaces: connected to a higher level router

   IP address configuration: 200:68 L4

   i.e., this is a level 3 interface with the IP address 200:68 and it
   is connected to a level 4 router

   SAME LEVEL interfaces: connected to a same level router

   IP address configuration: 200:1001 L3

INTERNET DRAFT           New IP address format         February 23, 2012


   SAME LEVEL interfaces : connected to host(s)

   There are 65535 host addresses; they may not be under the same
   interface/router, and therefore, it is required to summarize the
   IP address at the interface level (to avoid subnetting).

   IP address configuration: 200:2002 L3 range 2003 - 2300

   The "range" keyword indicates that the host addresses 2003 to 2300
   are accessible through this interface. The range must be the
   continuation of interface address.

   DOWNSTREAM interfaces: connected to a lower level router

   IP address configuration: 200:235 L2 548

   where 200 is the network, 235 is the interface address,
   L2 is the level of neighbor and 548 is the downstream network.


3.2  Assign IP addresses to Host

   Need to configure only the host portion of the IP address.

   For example:
    3001

4  Identify the Globally unique address

   All devices must query the top most router ( bits are set to 1 in the
   level field) to find its unique global IP address.

   when a query arrives at the incoming interface, router should append
   its network address to the query packet. The top most router (the one
   has no upstream interface) will replay to that query. The replay
   packet should include the unique IP address.

5  Routing

5.1  Functions of a Host

   Request Globally unique destination address from the DNS

   Host should compare its unique address with the unique destination
   address. Trim off the unwanted top level information, if any, and
   send the packet to the destination.

   Example: A five level network.

   source         400.3.12345.22.8:100          --> 22.8:100 L2

   destination    400.3.12345.22.9:34569        --> 22.9:34569 L2

5.2  Functions of a router

   same level routers exchange routing information.

   Routing logic

   check the level of ip address

   if greater than router level - simply forward the packet to upstream
   router.

   if same as router level - then search for downstream network

     if downstream network is present
          (if the downstream network is under another router,
           then forward the packet to neighbor router)
           remove router level network address from the destination
           address field, decrement destination level and then
           forward packet.

     else forward the packet to the same level neighbor router or
         to the host



   Note: in routing logic a 0 in the downstream network field is equal
   to no downstream network.

   IP address 3.0.0:200 L3 is a level 3 host address

6  Multicast

   The idea is to request multicast feed directly from the source.

   Reserve some level 0 host address range for multicast.

   For example: 1111111111000000

   Range 65472 - 65534

   Multicast routing


   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |     | 3   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
     3     2      11    16    16    16    16    16    16    16
          Bits

   2 bits are reserved for multicast.

   Request Multicast feed

   Set the multicast flag bits to 10 ( binary ) and send request
   towards the multicast source ; if this is the first
   request, router will forward the request to the next router towards
   the multicast source. For all subsequent requests for this unique
   multicast source, router will keep track of those requests in a
   table. no need to forward request. Repeat the process in each level.

   In the multicast request packet, the source address has no
   importance. Hence, we can attach the expected multicast destination
   address as the source address, as a level 0 address.

   Example:

   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |  7  |  1  | 200 | 857 | 348 |2000 |  4  | 629 | 10  | 325 |
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |65475|
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

   The host is requesting multicast feed from

   200.857.348.2000.4.629.20:325 with the destination multicast

   address 65475.

   Build a request table using this information.


   +---------+------------------------------+----------+----------+
   | Sequence| Multicast source             | Multicast| Requested|
   | NO      |  Address                     | address  | interface|
   +---------+------------------------------+----------+----------+
   |    1    |200.857.348.2000.4.629.20:325 |  65475   |   xx     |
   +---------+------------------------------+----------+----------+
   |         |                              |          |          |
   +---------+------------------------------+----------+----------+
   |         |                              |          |          |
   +---------+------------------------------+----------+----------+

   Multicast feed

   Identify the multicast packet either by the reserved multicast range
   or use the flag bits 11 (in binary - multicast feed):  check the flag
   bits, source, and destination then replicate the feed to all
   requested interfaces.

   cancel multicast request - flag 10 ( in binary): host will send a
   cancellation request towards the destination. if this is the last
   request, then the router will forward the request to the next level.
   else cancel the request from the request table.
