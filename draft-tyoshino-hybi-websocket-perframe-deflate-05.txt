Internet-Draft    WebSocket Per-frame DEFLATE Extension    February 2012


1.  Introduction

   _This section is non-normative._

   As well as other protocols, octets exchanged over the WebSocket
   Protocol [RFC6455] can benefit from compression.  This specification
   adds DEFLATE [RFC1951] based compression functionality to the
   WebSocket Protocol using its extension framework.

   Per-frame DEFLATE extension applies DEFLATE to the octets in the
   "Application data" part of data frames.  To align the end of
   compressed data to octet boundary, this extension uses the algorithm
   described in the Section 2.1 of the PPP Deflate Protocol [RFC1979].
   Endpoints can take over the LZ77 sliding window [LZ77] used to build
   previous frames to get better compression ratio.

   The simplest "Sec-WebSocket-Extensions" header in the client's
   opening handshake to request per-frame DEFLATE extension is the
   following:

       Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: deflate-frame

   The simplest header from the server to accept this extension is the
   same.

2.  Conformance Requirements

   Everything in this specification except for sections explicitly
   marked non-normative is normative.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft    WebSocket Per-frame DEFLATE Extension    February 2012


3.  Extension Negotiation

   The registered extension token for this extension is "deflate-frame".

   To request use of per-frame DEFLATE extension, a client MUST include
   the "deflate-frame" extension token in the "Sec-WebSocket-Extensions"
   header in its opening handshake.

   To accept use of per-frame DEFLATE extension requested by the client,
   a server MUST include the "deflate-frame" extension token in the
   "Sec-WebSocket-Extensions" header in its opening handshake.

   An endpoint MAY attach one or more extension parameters as defined
   below to the extension token.

   Maximum LZ77 sliding window size
      An endpoint MAY attach "max_window_bits" extension parameter to
      limit the LZ77 sliding window size that the other peer uses to
      build frames.  This parameter MUST have an integer value in the
      range between 8 to 15 indicating the base-2 logarithm of the LZ77
      sliding window size.  An endpoint that received this parameter
      MUST NOT use LZ77 sliding window size greater than this value to
      build frames.

   Disallow compression context takeover
      An endpoint MAY attach "no_context_takeover" extension parameter
      to disallow the other peer to take over the LZ77 sliding window
      used to build previous frames.  This parameter has no value.  An
      endpoint that received this parameter MUST use an empty LZ77
      sliding window to build every frame.

   A server MUST ignore any unknown extension parameter attached to
   "deflate-frame" extension token in the client's opening handshake.

   A client MUST _Fail the WebSocket Connection_ if any unknown
   extension parameter is attached to "deflate-frame" extension token in
   the server's opening handshake.

   Once per-frame DEFLATE extension is accepted, both endpoints MUST use
   the algorithm described in Section 4 to exchange frames.

Internet-Draft    WebSocket Per-frame DEFLATE Extension    February 2012


4.  Application Data Transformation

   This extension uses one reserved bit to indicate whether DEFLATE is
   applied to the frame or not.  We call this "COMP" bit.

   This extension operates only on data frames, and only on the
   "Application data" therein (it does not affect the "Extension data"
   portion of the "Payload data").

4.1.  Sending

   To send a frame with DEFLATE applied, an endpoint MUST use the
   following algorithm.

   1.  Apply DEFLATE [RFC1951] to all the octets in the "Application
       data" part of the frame.  Multiple blocks MAY be used.  Any type
       of block MAY be used.  Both block with "BFINAL" set to 0 and 1
       MAY be used.

   2.  If the resulting data does not end with an empty block with no
       compression ("BTYPE" set to 0), append an empty block with no
       compression to the tail.

   3.  Remove 4 octets (that are 0x00 0x00 0xff 0xff) from the tail.

   4.  Build a frame by putting the resulting octets in the "Application
       data" part instead of the original octets.  The payload length
       field of the frame MUST be the sum of the size of the "Extension
       data" part and these resulting octets.  "COMP" bit MUST be set to
       1.

   An endpoint MUST NOT use LZ77 sliding window size greater than 32,768
   to build frames.

   If an endpoint received the "max_window_bits" extension parameter on
   opening handshake, it MUST NOT use LZ77 sliding window size greater
   than the "max_window_bits"-th power of 2 to build frames.

   Unless it's prohibited by the other peer by the "no_context_takeover"
   extension parameter on opening handshake, an endpoint MAY take over
   the LZ77 sliding window used to build the last frame with DEFLATE
   applied.

   To send a frame with DEFLATE not applied, an endpoint MUST set "COMP"
   bit of the frame to 0.

Internet-Draft    WebSocket Per-frame DEFLATE Extension    February 2012


4.2.  Receiving

   To receive a frame with "COMP" bit set to 1, an endpoint MUST use the
   following algorithm.

   1.  Append 4 octets of 0x00 0x00 0xff 0xff to the tail of the
       "Application data" part.

   2.  Decode the resulting octets using DEFLATE.

   Unless an endpoint sent the "max_window_bits" extension parameter on
   opening handshake, the endpoint MUST use 32,768 byte LZ77 sliding
   window to decode frames.

   If an endpoint sent the "max_window_bits" extension parameter on
   opening handshake, it MAY reduce LZ77 sliding window size down to the
   "max_window_bits"-th power of 2 to decode frames.

   Unless the endpoint sent the "no_context_takeover" extension
   parameter on opening handshake, an endpoint MUST take over the LZ77
   sliding window used to decode the last frame with DEFLATE applied.

   To receive a frame with "COMP" bit set to 0, an endpoint MUST receive
   it without any DEFLATE processing.

4.3.  Examples

   _This section is non-normative._

   These are examples of resulting data after applying the algorithm
   above.

   o  "Hello" in one compressed block

      *  0xf2 0x48 0xcd 0xc9 0xc9 0x07 0x00

      "Hello" in one compressed block in the next frame

      *  0xf2 0x00 0x11 0x00 0x00

   o  "Hello" in one block with no compression

      *  0x00 0x05 0x00 0xfa 0xff 0x48 0x65 0x6c 0x6c 0x6f 0x00

   o  "Hello" in one block with "BFINAL" set to 1

      *  0xf3 0x48 0xcd 0xc9 0xc9 0x07 0x00 0x00

   o  "He" and "llo" in separate blocks

      *  0xf2 0x48 0x05 0x00 0x00 0x00 0xff 0xff 0xca 0xc9 0xc9 0x07
         0x00

5.  Implementation Note

   _This section is non-normative._

   On common software development platforms, the operation of aligning
   compressed data to octet boundary using an empty block with no
   compression is available as library.  For example, Zlib [Zlib] does
   this when "Z_SYNC_FLUSH" is passed to deflate function.

   To get sufficient compression ratio, LZ77 sliding window size of
   1,024 or more is recommended.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Registration of the "deflate-frame" WebSocket Extension Name

   This section describes a WebSocket extension name registration in the
   WebSocket Extension Name Registry.  [RFC6455].

   Extension Identifier
      deflate-frame

   Extension Common Name
      WebSocket Per-frame DEFLATE

   Extension Definition
      Section 3 and Section 4 of this document.

   Known Incompatible Extensions
      None

   The "deflate-frame" token is used in the "Sec-WebSocket-Extensions"
   header in the WebSocket opening handshake to negotiate use of per-
   frame DEFLATE compression extension.

7.2.  Registration of the "COMP" WebSocket Framing Header Bit

   This section describes a WebSocket framing header bit registration in
   the WebSocket Framing Header Bits Registry.  [RFC6455]

   Header Bit
      RSV1

   Common Name
      COMP

   Meaning
      DEFLATE is applied to the frame or not.

   Reference
      Section 4 of this document.

   The "COMP" framing header bit is used to indicate whether the
   "Application data" part of the frame contains octets generated using
   DEFLATE or not.
