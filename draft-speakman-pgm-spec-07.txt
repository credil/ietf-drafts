Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM) is a reliable multicast transport
protocol for applications that require ordered or unordered,
duplicate-free, multicast data delivery from multiple sources to
multiple receivers.  PGM guarantees that a receiver in the group
either receives all data packets from transmissions and repairs, or is
able to detect unrecoverable data packet loss.  PGM is specifically
intended as a workable solution for multicast applications with basic
reliability requirements.  Its central design goal is simplicity of
operation with due regard for scalability and network efficiency.
