	<abstract>
		<t> This memo presents extensions to the Abuse Reporting
		    Format (ARF), and Sender Policy Framework (SPF)
 		    specifications to allow for detailed reporting of message
		    authentication failures in an on-demand fashion. </t>
		<t> This memo updates RFC4408 by providing an IANA registry
                    for SPF modifiers.</t>

	<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
		<t> <xref target="ARF"/> defines a message format for sending
		    reports of abuse in the messaging infrastructure, with an
		    eye toward automating both the generating and consumption
		    of those reports. </t>

		<t> <xref target="SPF"/> is one mechanism for message sender
		    authentication; it is "path-based" meaning it authenticates
		    the route that a message took from origin to destination.
		    The output is a verified domain name that can then be
		    subjected to some sort of evaluation process
		    (e.g., comparison to a known-good list, submission
		    to a reputation service, etc.). </t>

		<t> This document extends <xref target="SPF"/> to add an
		    optional reporting address and other parameters.
		    Extension of <xref target="ARF"/> to add features required
		    for the reporting of these incidents is covered in <xref
		    target="I-D.IETF-MARF-AUTHFAILURE-REPORT"/> and <xref
		    target="I-D.IETF-MARF-AS"/>.</t>

		<t> This document additionally creates a an IANA registry of
		    <xref target="SPF"/> record modifiers to avoid modifier
		    namespace collisions.</t>

	 title="Optional Reporting Address for SPF">
		<t> There exist cases in which an ADministrative Management
		    Domain (ADMD) (see <xref target="EMAIL-ARCH"/>) employing
 		    <xref target="SPF"/> for announcing sending practices may
 		    want to know when messages are received via unauthorized
		    routing.  Currently there is no such method defined in
		    conjunction with standardized approaches such as
		    <xref target="ARF"/>. Similar information can be gathered
		    using a specially crafted <xref target="SPF"/> record and
		    a special DNS server to track <xref target="SPF"/> record
		    lookups.</t>

		<t> This document defines the following optional "modifier"
		    (as defined in Section 4.6.1 of <xref target="SPF"/>) to
		    SPF records, using the form defined in that specification:

		<list style="hanging">
			<t hangText="ra="> Reporting Address (plain-text;
			OPTIONAL; no default).  MUST be a local-part (see 
                        Section 3.4.1 of <xref target="MAIL"/>) specifying an 
                        e-mail address to which a report SHOULD be sent when
                        mail claiming to be from this domain (see Section  2.4 
                        of <xref target="SPF"/> for a description of how domains
                        are identified for SPF checks) has failed the evaluation
                        algorithm described in <xref target="SPF"/>, in
                        particular because a message arrived via an unauthorized
                        route. To generate a complete address to which the
                        report is sent, the verifier simply appends to this
                        value an "@" followed by the SPF-compliant domain per
                        paragraph 4.1 of <xref target="SPF"/>. ra= modifiers
                        in a record that was reached by following an include:

			<t hangText="rp="> Requested Report Percentage
                        (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "100").  The value is
                        an integer from 0 to 100 inclusive that indicates what
                        percentage of incidents of SPF failures, selected at
                        random, are to cause reports to be generated.  The
                        report generator SHOULD NOT issue reports for more than
                        the requested percentage of incidents.  An exception to
                        this might be some out-of-band arrangement between two
                        parties to override it with some mutually agreed value.
                        Report generators MAY make use of the "Incidents:"
                        field in [ARF] to indicate that there are more
