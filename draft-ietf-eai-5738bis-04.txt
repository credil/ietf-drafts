Internet-Draft           IMAP Support for UTF-8                June 2012


1.  Introduction

   This specification extends IMAP4rev1 [RFC3501] to permit UTF-8
   [RFC3629] in headers as described in "Internationalized Email
   Headers" [RFC6532] .  It also adds a mechanism to support mailbox
   names, login names, and passwords using the UTF-8 charset.  This
   specification creates two new IMAP capabilities to allow servers to
   advertise these new extensions.

   Most of this specification assumes that the IMAP server will be
   operating in a fully internationalized environment, i.e., one in
   which all clients accessing the server will be able to accept non-
   ASCII message header fields and other information as specified in
   Section 3.  At least during a transition period, that assumption will
   not be realistic for many environments; the issues involved are
   discussed in Section 7 below.

   This specification replaces an earlier, experimental, approach to the
   same problem [RFC5738].

2.  Conventions Used in this Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
   in this document are to be interpreted as defined in "Key words for
   use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [RFC2119].

   The formal syntax uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   [RFC5234] notation including the core rules defined in Appendix B of
   [RFC5234].  In addition, rules from IMAP4rev1 [RFC3501], UTF-8
   [RFC3629], "Collected Extensions to IMAP4 ABNF" [RFC4466], and IMAP4
   LIST Command Extensions [RFC5258] are also referenced.

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server, respectively.  If a single "C:" or "S:" label applies to
   multiple lines, then the line breaks between those lines are for
   editorial clarity only and are not part of the actual protocol
   exchange.

3.  UTF8=ACCEPT IMAP Capability

   The "UTF8=ACCEPT" capability indicates that the server supports UTF-8
   quoted strings, the "UTF8" parameter to SELECT and EXAMINE, and UTF-8
   responses from the LIST and LSUB commands.

   A client MUST use the "ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT" command (defined in
   [RFC5161]) to indicate to the server that the client accepts UTF-8
   quoted-strings.  The "ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT" command MUST only be used
   in the authenticated state.  (Note that the "UTF8=ONLY" capability

Internet-Draft           IMAP Support for UTF-8                June 2012


   described in Section 6 imply the "UTF8=ACCEPT" capability.  See
   additional information in these sections.)

3.1.  IMAP UTF-8 Quoted Strings

   The IMAP4rev1 [RFC3501] base specification forbids the use of 8-bit
   characters in atoms or quoted strings.  Thus, a UTF-8 string can only
   be sent as a literal.  This can be inconvenient from a coding
   standpoint, and unless the server offers IMAP4 non-synchronizing
   literals [RFC2088], this requires an extra round trip for each UTF-8
   string sent by the client.  When the IMAP server advertises the
   "UTF8=ACCEPT" capability, it informs the client that it supports
   native UTF-8 quoted-strings with the following syntax:

        string        =/ uQuoted

        uQuoted       = "*" DQUOTE *uQUOTED-CHAR DQUOTE
              ; referred as 'utf8-quote' in this document

        DQUOTE        = <Defined in appendix B.1 of RFC 5234>

        uQUOTED-CHAR  = QUOTED-CHAR / UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4

        UTF8-2        =   <Defined in Section 4 of RFC3629>

        UTF8-3        =   <Defined in Section 4 of RFC3629>

        UTF8-4        =   <Defined in Section 4 of RFC3629>


   When this quoting mechanism is used by the client (specifically an
   octet sequence beginning with *" and ending with "), then the server
   MUST reject octet sequences with the high bit set that fail to comply
   with the formal syntax in [RFC3629] with a BAD response.

   The IMAP server MUST NOT send utf8-quoted syntax to the client unless
   the client has indicated support for that syntax by using the "ENABLE
   UTF8=ACCEPT" command.

   If the server advertises the "UTF8=ACCEPT" capability, the client MAY
   use utf8-quoted syntax with any IMAP argument that permits a string
   (including astring and nstring).  However, if characters outside the
   US-ASCII repertoire are used in an inappropriate place, the results
   would be the same as if other syntactically valid but semantically
   invalid characters were used.  Specific cases where UTF-8 characters
   are permitted or not permitted are described in the following
   paragraphs.

Internet-Draft           IMAP Support for UTF-8                June 2012


   All IMAP servers that advertise the "UTF8=ACCEPT" capability SHOULD
   accept UTF-8 in mailbox names, and those that also support the
   "Mailbox International Naming Convention" described in RFC 3501,
   Section 5.1.3 MUST accept utf8-quoted mailbox names and convert them
   to the appropriate internal format.  Mailbox names MUST comply with
   the Net-Unicode Definition (Section 2 of [RFC5198]) with the specific
   exception that they MUST NOT contain control characters (0000-001F,
   0080-009F), delete (007F), line separator (2028), or paragraph
   separator (2029).

   An IMAP client MUST NOT issue a SEARCH command that uses a mixture of
   utf8-quoted syntax and a SEARCH CHARSET other than UTF-8.  If an IMAP
   server receives such a SEARCH command, it SHOULD reject the command
   with a BAD response (due to the conflicting charset labels).

4.  IMAP UTF8 Append Data Extension

   If the "UTF8=ACCEPT" capability is advertised, then the server
   accepts UTF-8 headers in the APPEND command message argument.  A
   client that sends a message with UTF-8 headers to the server MUST
   send them using the "UTF8" APPEND data extension.  If the server also
   advertises the CATENATE capability (as specified in [RFC4469]), the
   client can use the same data extension to include such a message in a
   CATENATE message part.  The ABNF for the APPEND data extension and
   CATENATE extension follows:

        utf8-literal   = "UTF8" SP "(" literal8 ")"

        append-data    =/ utf8-literal

        cat-part       =/ utf8-literal

   A server that advertises "UTF8=ACCEPT" MAY fail for \NotUTF8
   mailboxes with a NOT-UTF-8 response code.  If this command does not
   fail, it MAY follow the requirements of the IMAP base specification
   and [RFC5322] for message fetching.  Mechanisms for 7-bit downgrading
   to help comply with the standards are discussed in
   [popimap-downgrade].

   IMAP servers that advertise support for "UTF8=ACCEPT" or "UTF8=ONLY"
   MUST reject an APPEND command that includes any 8-bit in the message
   headers with a "NO" response, when IMAP clients do not issue "ENABLE
   UTF8=ACCEPT" or "ENABLE UTF8=ONLY".

   Note that the "UTF8=ONLY" capability described in Section 6 implies
   the "UTF8=ACCEPT" capability.  See additional information in that
   section.

5.  LOGIN Command and UTF-8

   This specification doesn't extend the IMAP LOGIN command [RFC3501] to
   support UTF-8 usernames and passwords.  Whenever a client needs to
   use UTF-8 username/passwords, it MUST use the IMAP AUTHENTICATE
   command which is already capable of passing UTF-8 user names and
   credentials.

   Although this makes it syntacically legal to have a UTF-8 user name
   or password, there is no guarantee the user provisioning system used
   by the IMAP server will allow such identities.  This is an
   implementation decision and MAY depend on what identity system the
   IMAP server is configured to use.

6.  UTF8=ONLY Capability

   The "UTF8=ONLY" capability permits an IMAP server to advertise that
   it does not support the international mailbox name convention
   (modified UTF-7), and does not permit selection or examination of any
   mailbox unless the "UTF8" parameter is provided.  As this is an
   incompatible change to IMAP, a clear warning is necessary.  IMAP
   clients that find implementation of the "UTF8=ONLY" capability
   problematic are encouraged to at least detect the "UTF8=ONLY"
   capability and provide an informative error message to the end-user.

   The "UTF8=ONLY" capability implies the "UTF8=ACCEPT" capability.
   UTF8=ACCEPT and UTF8=ONLY SHOULD be mutually exclusive.  An IMAP
   server can advertise one of them, but never both.

7.   Dealing With Legacy Clients

   In most situations, it will be difficult or impossible for the
   implementer or operator of an IMAP (or POP) server to know whether
   all of the clients that might access it, or the associated mail store
   more generally, will be able to support the facilities defined in
   this document.  In almost all cases, servers who conform to this
   specification will have to be prepared to deal with clients that do
   not enable the relevant capabilities.  Unfortunately, there is no
   completely satisfactory way to do so other than for systems that wish
   to receive email that requires SMTPUTF8 capabilities to be sure that
   all components of those systems -- including IMAP and other clients
   selected by users -- are upgraded appropriately.

   Choices available to the server when a message that requires SMTPUTF8
   is encountered and the client doesn't enable UTF-8 capability include
   hiding the problematic message(s) as outlined elsewhere in this
   specification, creating in band or out of band notifications or error
   messages, or somehow trying to create a variation on the message with

Internet-Draft           IMAP Support for UTF-8                June 2012


   the intention of providing useful information to that client about
   what has occurred.  Such variant messages cannot be actual
   substitutes for the original message: it will rarely be possible to
   reply to (either at all or without loss of information), new header
   fields or specialized constructs for server-client communication may
   go beyond the requirements of, e.g., RFC 5322 and may consequently
   confuse some legacy mail user agents (including IMAP clients) or
   otherwise not provide the expected information to users.  There are
   also tradeoffs in constructing variants of the original message
   between accepting complexity and additional computation costs in
   order to try to preserve as much information as possible (for
   example, in [popimap-downgrade]) and trying to minimize those costs
   while still providing useful information (for example, in
   [I-D.ietf-eai-simpledowngrade]).

   Because such messages are really variations on the original ones, not
   really "downgraded" (ones although that terminology is often used for
   convenience), they inevitably have relationships to the original ones
   that the IMAP specification [RFC3501] did not anticipate.  In
   particular, digital signatures computed over the original message
   will often not be applicable to the variant version and servers that
   may be accessed by the same user with different clients or methods
   (e.g., POP or webmail systems in addition to IMAP or IMAP clients
   with different capabilities) will need to exert extreme care to be
   sure that UIDVALIDITY behaves as the user would expect.  Those issues
   may be especially sensitive if the server caches the variant message
   or computes and stores it when the message arrives with the intent of
   making either form available depending on client capabilities.

   The best (or "least bad") approach for any given environment will
   depend on local conditions, local assumptions about user behavior,
   the degree of control the server operator has over client usage and
   upgrading, the options that are actually available, and so on.  It is
   impossible, at least at the time, to give good advice that will apply
   to all situations, or even particular profiles of situations, other
   than "upgrade legacy clients as soon as possible".

8.  Issues with UTF-8 Header Mailstore

   When an IMAP server uses a mailbox format that supports UTF-8 headers
   and it permits selection or examination of that mailbox without the
   "UTF8" parameter, it is the responsibility of the server to comply
   with the IMAP4rev1 base specification [RFC3501] and [RFC5322] with
   respect to all header information transmitted over the wire.
   Mechanisms for 7-bit downgrading to help comply with the standards
   are discussed in [popimap-downgrade].

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds two new capabilities ("UTF8=ACCEPT" and
   "UTF8=ONLY") to the IMAP4rev1 Capabilities registry [RFC3501].  Three
   other IMAP capabilites that were described in the experimental
   predecessor to this document (UTF8=ALL, UTF8=APPEND, UTF8=USER) are
   to be marked OBSOLETE in the registry.

10.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of UTF-8 [RFC3629] and SASLprep [RFC4013]
   apply to this specification, particularly with respect to use of
   UTF-8 in user names and passwords.  Otherwise, this is not believed
   to alter the security considerations of IMAP4rev1.

   Special considerations, some of them with security implications,
   occur if a server that conforms to this specification is accessed by
   a client that does not and in some more complex situations in which a
   given message is accessed by multiple clients that might use
   different protocols and/or support different capabilities.  Those
   issues are discussed in Section 7 above.

Internet-Draft           IMAP Support for UTF-8                June 2012


Appendix A.  Appendix A. Design Rationale

   This non-normative section discusses the reasons behind some of the
   design choices in the above specification.

   The basic approach of advertising the ability to access a mailbox in
   UTF-8 mode is intended to permit graceful upgrade, including servers
   that support multiple mailbox formats.  In particular, it would be
   undesirable to force conversion of an entire server mailstore to
   UTF-8 headers, so being able to phase-in support for new mailboxes
   and gradually migrate old mailboxes is permitted by this design.

   The "UTF8=ONLY" mechanism simplifies diagnosis of interoperability
   problems when legacy support goes away.  In the situation where
   backwards compatibility is broken anyway, just-send-UTF-8 IMAP has
   the advantage that it might work with some legacy clients.  However,
   the difficulty of diagnosing interoperability problems caused by a
   just-send-UTF-8 IMAP mechanism is the reason the "UTF8=ONLY"
   capability mechanism was chosen.
