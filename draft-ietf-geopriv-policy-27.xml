    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines an authorization policy language for controlling access to location
        information. It extends the Common Policy authorization framework to provide
        location-specific access control. More specifically, this document defines condition
        elements specific to location information in order to restrict access to data based on the current
        location of the Target.</t>
      <t>Furthermore, this document defines two algorithms for
      reducing the granularity of returned location information.  The
      first algorithm is defined for usage with civic location
      information while the other one applies to geodetic location
      information.  Both algorithms come with limitations.  There are
      circumstances where the amount of location obfuscation provided
      is less than what is desired.  These algorithms might not be
      appropriate for all application domains.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>Location information needs to be protected against unauthorized access to preserve the
        privacy of humans. In RFC 6280 <xref target="RFC6280"/>, a protocol-independent model for
        access to geographic information is defined. The model includes a Location Generator (LG)
        that determines location information, a Location Server (LS) that authorizes access to
        location information, a Location Recipient (LR) that requests and receives location
        information, and a Rule Maker (RM) that writes authorization policies. An authorization
        policy is a set of rules that regulates an entity's activities with respect to
        privacy-sensitive information, such as location information. </t>
      <t>The data object containing location information in the context of this document is referred
        to as a Location Object (LO). The basic rule set defined in the Presence Information Data
        Format Location Object (PIDF-LO) <xref target="RFC4119"/> can restrict how long the Location
        Recipient is allowed to retain the information, and it can prohibit further distribution. It
        also contains a reference to an enhanced rule set and a human readable privacy policy. The
        basic rule set does not access to location information. This document describes an enhanced rule set that provides
        richer constraints on the distribution of LOs.</t>
      <t>The enhanced rule set allows the entity that uses the rules defined in this document to restrict the
        retention and to enforce access restrictions on location data, including prohibiting any
        dissemination to particular individuals, during particular times or when the Target is
        located in a specific region. The RM can also stipulate that only certain parts of the
        Location Object are to be distributed to recipients or that the resolution is reduced for parts of the
        Location Object.</t>
      <t>In the typical sequence of operations, a Location Server receives a query for
        location information for a particular Target. The requestor's identity will likely be revealed 
        as part of this request for location information. The authenticated identity of the
        Location Recipient, together with other information provided with the request or
        generally available to the server, is then used for searching through the rule set. If more
        than one rule matches the condition element, then the combined permission is evaluated
        according to the description in Section 10 of <xref target="RFC4745"/>. The result of the
        rule evalation is applied to the location information, yielding a possibly modified Location
        Object that is delivered to the Location Recipient.</t>
      <t>This document does not describe the protocol used to convey location information from the
        Location Server to the Location Recipient. </t>
      <t>This document extends the Common Policy framework defined in <xref target="RFC4745"/>. That
        document provides an abstract framework for expressing authorization rules. As specified
        there, each such rule consists of conditions, actions and transformations. Conditions
        determine under which circumstances the entity executing the rules, such as a Location
        Server, is permitted to apply actions and transformations. Transformations regulate in a
        location information context how a Location Server modifies the information elements that
        are returned to the requestor by, for example, reducing the granularity of returned location
        information.</t>
      <t>This document defines two algorithms for reducing the granularity of returned location information. 
        The first algorithm is defined for usage with civic location information (see <xref target="civic-transformation"/>) while the other one applies to geodetic location information (see <xref target="geodetic-transformation"/>).
       Both algorithms come with limitations, i.e. they provide location obfuscation under certain conditions and may therefore not be appropriate for all application domains. These limitations are documented within the security consideration section (see <xref target="security"/>). It is worth pointing out that the geodetic transformation algorithm <xref target="geodetic-transformation"/> deals with privacy risks related to targets that are stationary, as well as to moving targets. However, with respect to movement there are restriction as to what information can be hidden from an adversary. To cover applications that have more sophisticated privacy requirements additional algorithms may need to be defined. This document forsees extensions in the form of new algorithms and therefore defines a registy (see <xref target="profile-registry"/>).
</t>
      <t>The XML schema defined in <xref target="schema"/> extends the Common Policy schema by
        introducing new child elements to the condition and transformation elements. This document
        does not define child elements for the action part of a rule.</t>

        Server (LS), Location Recipient (LR), Rule Maker (RM), Target, Location Generator (LG) and
        Location Object (LO). This document uses the following terminology:</t>

          <t hangText="Presentity or Target:">
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>RFC 6280 <xref target="RFC6280"/> uses the term Target to
            identify the object or person of which location information is required. The presence
            model described in RFC 2778 <xref target="RFC2778"/> uses the term presentity to
            describe the entity that provides presence information to a presence service. A
            Presentity in a presence system is a Target in a location information system.<vspace

            (LR) in the terminology of RFC 6280 <xref target="RFC6280"/>. A watcher in a presence

      </t>
      <t>In this document we use the term Location Servers as the entities that evaluate the
        geolocation authorization policies. The geolocation privacy architecture is, as described in
        RFC 4079 <xref target="RFC4079"/>, aligned with the presence architecture and a Presence
        Server is therefore an entity that distributes location information along with other
        presence-specific XML data elements.</t>
    </section>

    <!-- ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->

    <section title="Generic Processing">
      <section title="Structure of Geolocation Authorization Documents">
        <t> A geolocation authorization document is an XML document, formatted according to the
          schema defined in <xref target="RFC4745"/>. Geolocation authorization documents inherit
          the media type of common policy documents, application/auth-policy+xml. As described in
            <xref target="RFC4745"/>, this document is composed of rules which contain three parts -
          conditions, actions, and transformations. Each action or transformation, which is also
          called a permission, has the property of being a positive grant of information to the
          Location Recipient. As a result, there is a well-defined mechanism for combining actions
          and transformations obtained from several sources. This mechanism is privacy enabling, since
          the lack of any action or transformation can only result in less information being
          presented to a Location Recipient. </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="rule-transport" title="Rule Transport">
        <t>There are two ways the authorization rules described in this document may be conveyed
          between different parties:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>RFC 4119 <xref target="RFC4119"/> allows enhanced authorization policies to be
              referenced via a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) in the 'ruleset-reference' element.
              The ruleset-reference' element is part of the basic rules that always travel with the
              Location Object. </t>
            <t>Authorization policies might, for example, also be stored at a Location Server /
              Presence Server. The Rule Maker therefore needs to use a protocol to create, modify
              and delete the authorization policies defined in this document. Such a protocol is
              available with the Extensible Markup Language (XML) Configuration Access Protocol
              (XCAP) <xref target="RFC4825"/>.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <!-- ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->

    <section anchor="conditions" title="Location-specific Conditions">
      <t>This section describes the location-specific conditions of a rule. The
        &lt;conditions&gt; element contains zero or more
        &lt;location-condition&gt; child element(s). The &gt;conditions> element only evaluates to TRUE if all child elements evaluate to TRUE, therefore multiple &lt;location-condition&gt; elements are not normally useful.
       </t>
       <t>The &lt;location-condition&gt;
        element MUST contain at least one &lt;location&gt; child element. The
        &lt;location-condition&gt; element evaluates to TRUE if any of its child &gt;location> elements matches the location of the target, i.e., &gt;location> elements are combined using a logical OR. </t>
      <t>The three attributes of &lt;location&gt; are 'profile', 'xml:lang' and
        'label'. The 'profile' indicates the location profile that is included as
        child elements in the &lt;location&gt; element.  Two location profiles, geodetic and civic, are defined in <xref
          target="geodetic-condition"/> and <xref target="civic-condition"/>.  Each profile describes
        under what conditions a &lt;location&gt; element evaluates to TRUE.
        </t>
        <t>The 'label' attribute
        allows a human readable description to be added to each &lt;location&gt; element. The
        'xml:lang' attribute contains a language tag providing further information for rendering of
        the content of the 'label' attribute.</t>
      <t>The &lt;location-condition&gt; and the &lt;location&gt; elements provide
        extension points. An extension that is not understood by the entity evaluating the rules then
        this rule evaluates to FALSE.  This causes a &gt;conditions> element to evaluate to FALSE if a &gt;location-condition> element is unsupported, but allows a &gt;location-condition> to be TRUE if an child &gt;location> is not understood as long as an understoof &gt;location> is TRUE.</t>

      <section anchor="geodetic-condition" title="Geodetic Location Condition Profile">

        <t>The geodetic location profile is identified by the token 'geodetic-condition'. Rule
          Makers use this profile by placing a <xref target="GML">GML</xref> &lt;Circle&gt;
          element within the &lt;location&gt; element (as described in Section 5.2.3 of
            <xref target="RFC5491"/>). </t>

        <t>The &lt;location&gt; element containing the information for the geodetic location
          profile evaluates to TRUE if the current location of the Target is completely within the described
          location (see Section 6.1.15.3 of <xref target="OGC-06-103r4"/>). Note that the Target's actual location might be represented by any of the
          location shapes described in <xref target="RFC5491"/>. If the
          geodetic location of the Target is unknown then the &lt;location&gt; element
          containing the information for the geodetic location profile evaluates to FALSE. </t>

        </t>
        <t>A CRS MUST be specified using the above URN notation only, implementations do not need to
          support user-defined CRSs. </t>
        <t>Implementations MUST specify the CRS using the "srsName" attribute on the outermost
          geometry element. The CRS MUST NOT be changed for any sub-elements. The "srsDimension"
          attribute MUST be omitted, since the number of dimensions in these CRSs is known. </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="civic-condition" title="Civic Location Condition Profile">

        <t>The civic location profile is identified by the token 'civic-condition'. Rule Makers use
          this profile by placing a &lt;civicAddress&gt; element, defined in <xref
            target="RFC5139"/>, within the &lt;location&gt; element.</t>

        <t> All child elements of &lt;location&gt; element that carry &lt;civicAddress&gt; elements
          MUST evaluate to TRUE (i.e., logical AND) in order for the &lt;location&gt;
          element to evaluate to TRUE. For each child element, the value of that element is compared
          to the value of the same element in the Target's civic location. The child element
          evaluates to TRUE if the two values are identical based on a octet-by-octet comparison. </t>

        <t>A &lt;location&gt; element containing a &gt;civic-condition> profile evaluates to FALSE if a civic address is not present for the Target. For example, this
          could occur if location information has been removed by other rules or other transmitters
          of location information or if only the geodetic location is known. In general, it is
          RECOMMENDED behavior for a LS not to apply a translation from geodetic location to civic

<t>Given uncertainty "d", choose a grid of so called

<t>Notes:<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Regarding Step 1:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
The scale of a map is the ratio of a distance on (a
straight line) on the map to the corresponding air distance
on the ground. For maps covering larger areas, a map
projection from a sphere (or ellipsoid) to the plane will
introduce distortion and the scale of the map is not
constant. Also, note that the real distance on the ground
is taken along great circles, which may not correspond to
straight lines in the map, depending on the projection
used. Let us measure the (length) distortion of the map as
the quotient between the maximal and the minimal scales in
the map. The distortion MUST be below 1.5. (The minimum
distortion is 1.0: If the region of the map is small, then
the scale may be taken as a constant over the whole
map).
</t>
<t hangText="Regarding Step3:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
 SW is mnemonic for south-west, b for bottom, l for
left (SW=(l,b)), etc, but the
directions of the geodesic projection may be arbitrary, and
thus SW may be not south-west of M but it will be left and
below M *on the map*.

      <t>Suppose you want to obscure positions in the
continental USA.</t>

<t><list style="hanging"> 
<t hangText="Step 1:"> <vspace blankLines="1"/>
First you choose a geodesic projection. If you are
measuring location as latitude and longitude, a natural
choice is to take a rectangular projection. 
One latitudinal degree corresponds approximately to
110.6 kilometers, while a good approximation of a
longitudinal degree at latitude phi is (pi/180)*M*cos(phi),
where pi is approximately 3.1415, and M is the Earth's average
meridional radius, approximately 6,367.5 km. For instance, one
longitudinal degree at 30 degrees (say, New Orleans) is
96.39 km, while the formula given offers an estimation of
96.24, which is good for our purposes.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
We will set up a grid not only for the continental US, but
for the whole earth between latitudes 25 and 50 degrees,
and thus will cover also the Mediterranean, South Europe,
Japan and the north of China. As will be seen below, the
grid distortion (for not too large grids in this region) is
approx cos(25)/cos(50), which is 1.4099.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
As origin of our grid, we choose the point at latitude 25
degrees and longitude 0 (Greenwich). The latitude 25
degrees is chosen to be just south of Florida and thus south
of the continental US. (On the south hemisphere the origin
should be north of the region to be covered; if the region
crosses the Equator, the origin should be on the Equator.
In this way it is guaranteed that the latitudinal degree has
largest distance at the latitude of the origin).
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
At 25 degrees one degree in east-west direction corresponds
approx to (pi/180)*M*cos(25) = 100.72 km.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
The same procedure, basically, produces grids for
<list style="symbols">
<t>45 degrees south to 45 degrees north   Tropics and subtropics</t>
<t>25 to 50 degrees (both north or south) Continental US</t>
<t>35 to 55 degrees (both north or south) South and Central Europe</t>
<t>45 to 60 degrees (both north or south) Central and North Europe</t>
<t>55 to 65 degrees (both north or south) Scandinavia</t>
<t>60 to 70 degrees (both north or south)</t>
</list> 
Since we do not want to often change grid system (this
would leak more information about obscured locations when
they are repeatedly visited), the algorithm should prefer
to use the grids discussed above, with origin at the
Greenwich meridian and at latitudes o=0, o=25, o=35, o=45,
0=55, and o=60 degrees (north) or at latitudes o=-25,
o=-35, o=-45, 0=-55, and o=-60 degrees (the minus to
indicate "south").
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
Our choice for the continental USA is o=25.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
For locations close to the poles, a different projection
should be used (not discussed here).
<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
<t hangText="Step 2:"><vspace blankLines="1"/> 
To construct the grid points, we start with our
chosen origin and place the along the main axes (NS and EW)
grid points at a distance d of each other.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
We will now construct a grid for a desired uncertainty of
d = 100km. At our origin, 100 km correspond roughly to d1 =
100/100.72 = 0.993 degrees on east-west direction and to d2
= 100/110.6 = 0.904 degrees in north-south direction.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
The (i,j)-point in the grid (i and j are integers) has
longitude d1*i and latitude 25+d2*j, measured in degrees.
More generally, if the grid has origin at coordinates
(0,o), measured in degrees, the (i,j)-point in the grid has
coordinates (longitude = d1*i, latitude = o+d2*j).
The grid has almost no distorsion at the latitude of
the origin, but it has as we go further away from it.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
The distance between two points in the grid at 25
degrees latitude is indeed approx 100 km, but just above
the Canadian border, on the 50th degree, it is
0.993*(pi/180)*M*cos(50) = 70.92km. Thus, the grid
distortion is 100/70.92 = 1.41, which is acceptable (&lt;1.5).
(On north-south direction the grid has roughly no
distortion, the vertical distance between two neighboring
grid points is approximately 100 km).
<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
<t hangText="Step 3:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
Now suppose you measure a position at M, with
longitude -105 (the minus sign is used to denote 105
degrees *west*; without minus, the point is in China, 105
degrees east) and latitude 40 degrees (just north of
Denver, CO). The point M is 105 degrees west and 15 degrees
north of our origin (which has longitude 0 and latitude
25).
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
Let "floor" be the function that returns the largest
integer smaller or equal to a floating point number. To
calculate SW, the closest point of the grid on the
south-west of M=(m,n), we calculate
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
i= floor(m/d1) = floor(-105/0.993) = -106
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
j= floor(n-o/d2) = floor(15/0.904) = 16
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
Those are the indexes of SW on the grid. The coordinates of
SW are then: (d1*i, 25+d2*j) = (-105.242, 39.467).
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
Thus:
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
l=d1*floor(m/d1)     = -105.243
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
r=l+d1               = -105.243+0.993 =  -104.250
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
b=o+d2*floor(n-o/d2) = 39.467
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
t=b+d2               = 39.467+0.904 = 40.371
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
These are the formulas for l,r,b, and t in the general case
of Cartesian projections based on latitude and longitude.
<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
<t hangText="Step 4:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
Calculate x and y, the local coordinates of the
point M in the small grid square that contains it.  This is
easy:
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
x=(m-l)/(r-l) = [-105 -(-105.243)]/0.993 = 0.245
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
y=(n-b)/(t-b) = [40 - 39.467]/0.904 = 0.590
<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
<t hangText="Step 5:"><vspace blankLines="1"/>
First compare x with p (0.2887) and
(0.7113). x is smaller than p. Therefore, only cases 1,4 or
6 could hold.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
Also compare y with p (0.2887) and (0.7113). y is
between them: p &lt;= y &lt; q. Thus, we must be in case 4. To
check, compare y (0.59) with x (0.245) and 1-x. y
is larger than x and smaller than 1-x. We are in case C4 
(p &lt;= y &lt; q and x &lt;= y and y &lt; 1-x).
<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
<t hangText="Step 6:"><vspace blankLines="1"/> 
Now we choose either SW or NW as the center of the circle. 
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
The obscured location is the Circle with radius 100 km and
center in SW (coordinates: -105.243, 39.467), or NW
(coordinates: -105.243, 40.371).

    <section title="Introduction"> 
      <t>This document aims to allow users to prevent unauthorized access to location information
      and to restrict access to information dependent on geolocation (via location based conditions). 
      This is accomplished using authorization policies. This work builds on a series 
      of other documents: Security requirements are described in <xref target="RFC6280"/> and a 
      discussion of generic security threats is available with <xref target="RFC3694"/>. Aspects
      of combining permissions in cases of multiple occurrence are addressed in <xref target="RFC4745"/>.
      </t>
       
      <t>In addition to the authorization policies, mechanisms for obfuscating location information
      are described. A theoretical treatment of location obfuscation is provided in <xref
      target="duckham05"/> and in <xref target="ifip07"/>. <xref target="duckham05"/> provides the
      foundation and <xref target="ifip07"/> illustrates three different types of location
      obfuscation by enlarging the radius, by shifting the center, and by reducing the radius. The
      algorithm in <xref target="geodetic-transformation"/> for geodetic location information
      obfuscation uses of these techniques.
      </t>
      
      <t>The privacy protection requirements for altering location information vary. The two 
      obfuscation algorithms in this document provide a basis for protecting against unauthorized disclosure of location information they have limitations.  Application and user requirements vary widely; therefore, an extension mechanism is support for defining and using different algorithms. </t> 
    </section> 
     
    <section title="Obfuscation"> 
     
      <t>Whenever location information is returned to a location recipient it contains the location of the Target. 
      This is also true when location is obfuscated, i.e. the location server does not lie about the Target's location 
      but instead hides it within a larger location shape. Even without the Target's movement there is a danger that information will be revealed over time.  While the target's location is not revealed within a particular region of the grid, the size of that 
      returned region matters as well as the precise location of the Target within that region. Returning location shapes
      that are randomly computed will over time reveal more and more information about the Target. </t>
      <t>Consider the drawing in <xref target="static"/>, which shows three ellipses, a dotted area in the middle, and the Target's 
      true location marked as 'x'. The ellipses illustrate the location shapes as received by a potential location recipient over time
      for requests of a target's location information. Collecting information about the returned location information over time 
      allows the location recipient to narrow the potential location of the target down to the dotted area in the center of the graph.</t>
      <t>For this purpose the algorithm described in <xref target="geodetic-transformation"/> uses a grid
      that ensures the same location information is reported while the target remains in the same geographical 
      area.</t>

      <t>An obscuring method that returns different results for
      consecutive requests can be exploited by recipients wishing to
      use this property.  Rate limiting the generation of new obscured
      locations or providing the same obscured location to recipients
      for the same location might limit the information that can be
      obtained.  Note however that providing a new obscured location
      based on a change in location provides some information to
      recipients when they observe a change in location.</t>

      <t> When the Target is moving then the location transformations reveal information when
      switching from one privacy region to another one. For example, when a transformation indicates
      that civic location is provided at a 'building' level of granularity, floor levels, room
      numbers, and other details normally internal to a building would be hidden.  However, when the
      Target moves from one building to the next one then the movement would still be recognizable
      as the disclosed location information would be reflected by the new civic location information
      indicating the new building. With additional knowledge about building entrances and floor
      plans it would be possible to learn additional amount of information.</t>
        </section>
<section title="Algorithm Limitations">
      <t>The algorithm presented in <xref target="geodetic-transformation"/> has some issues where information is leaked: when moving, switching from one privacy region to another one; and also when the user regularly visits 
   the same location. 
</t>
<t>The first issue arises if the algorithm provides different location information 
  (privacy region) only when the previous one becomes inapplicable. The algorithm discloses new information the moment that the target is on the border of the old privacy region. 
</t>
<t>Another issue arises if the algorithm produces the different values for the same location that is repeatedly visited. 
  Suppose a user goes home every night. If the reported obfuscated locations are all randomly chosen, an 
  analysis can reveal the home location with high precision.
</t>
<t>In addition to these concerns, the combination of an 
  obscured location with public geographic information (highways, lakes, mountains, cities, etc) may render a 
  much more precise location information than is desired. But even without it, just observing movements, once or multiple times, any obscuring algorithm can leak information about velocities or positions. Suppose 
  a user wants to disclose location information with a radius of r. The privacy region, a circle with that radius,
  has an area of A = pi * r^2. An adversary, observing the movements, will deduce that the information that the 
  target is, was, or regularly visits, a region of size A1, smaller than A. The quotient of the sizes A1/A 
  should be, even in the worst case, larger than a fixed known number, in order that the user knows what is the 
  maximal information leakage he has. The choices of <xref target="geodetic-transformation"/> are such that this maximum leakage can be established: 
  by any statistical procedures, without using external information (highways, etc. as discussed above), the 
  quotient A1/A is larger than 0.13 (= 1/(5*1.5) ). Thus, for instance, when choosing a provided location of 
  size 1000 km^2, he will be leaking, in worst case, the location within a region of size 130 km^2.
  </t>  

    </section> 

    <section title="Usability"> 
    
      <t>There is the risk that end users are specifying their location-based policies in such a way
        that very small changes in location yields a significantly different level of information
        disclosure. For example, a user might want to set authorization policies differently when
        they are in a specific geographical area (e.g., at home, in the office). Location might be
        the only factor in the policy that triggers a very different action and transformation to be
        executed. The accuracy of location information is not always sufficient to unequivocally
        determine whether a location is within a specific boundary <xref
          target="I-D.thomson-geopriv-uncertainty"/>. In some situations uncertainty in location
        information could produce unexpected results for end users. Providing adequate
        user feedback about potential errors arising from these limitation can help prevent
        unintentional information leakage.</t>
      <t>Users might create policies that are non-sensical.
        <!-- For example, a user may express an authorization 
        policy in the following way: "Show my location unless I'm in seat 32A". -->
        To avoid such cases the software used to create the authorization policies should perform
        consistency checks and when authorization policies are uploaded to the policy servers then
        further checks can be performed. When XCAP is used to upload authorization policies then
        built-in features of XCAP can be utilized to convey error messages back to the user about an
        error condition. Section 8.2.5 of <xref target="RFC4825"/> indicates that some degree of
        application specific checking is provided when authorization policies are added, modified or
        deleted. The XCAP protocol may return a 409 response with a response that may contain a
        detailed conflict report containing the &lt;constraint-failure&gt; element. A human
        readable description of the problem can be indicated in the 'phrase' attribute of that
        element.</t>

    <section title="Location Obscuring Limitations" anchor="limitations"> 

<t> Location obscuring attempts to remove information about the
location of a Target.  The effectiveness of location obscuring is
determined by how much uncertainty a Location Recipient has about the
location of the Target.  A location obscuring algorithm is effective
if the Location Recipient cannot recover a location with better
uncertainty than the obscuring algorithm was instructed to add.
</t>
  
<t>
  Effective location obscuring is difficult.  The amount of
  information that can be recovered by a determined and resourceful
  Location Recipient can be considerably more than is immediately
  apparent.  A concise summary of the challenges is included in <xref
  target="duckham10"/>.
</t>

<t>
  A Location Recipient in possession of external information about the
  Target or geographical area that is reported can make assumptions or
  guesses aided by that information to recover more accurate location
  information.  This is true even when a single location is reported,
  but it is especially true when multiple locations are reported for
  the same Target over time.
</t>

<t>
  Furthermore, a Location Recipient that attempts to recover past
  locations for a Target can use later reported locations to further
  refine any recovered location.  A location obscuring algorithm
  typically does not have any information about the future location of
  the Target.
</t>

<t>
  The degree to which location information can be effectively degraded
  by an obscuring algorithm depends on the information that is used by
  the obscuring algorithm.  If the information available to the
  obscuring algorithm is both more extensive and more effectively
  employed than the information available to the Location Recipient,
  then location obscuring might be effective.
</t>

<t>
  Obscured locations can still serve a purpose where a Location
  Recipient is willing to respect privacy.  A privacy-respecting
  Location Recipient can choose to interpret the existence of
  uncertainty as a request from a Rule Maker to not recover location.
</t>

<t>
  Location obscuring is unlikely to be effective against a more
  determined or resourceful adversary.  Withholding location
  information entirely is perhaps the most effective method of
  ensuring that it is not recovered.  
</t>

<t>A caution: omitted data also conveys some information.  Selective
withholding of information reveals that there is something worth
hiding.  That information might be used to reveal something of the
information that is being withheld.  For example, if location is only
obscured around a user's home and office then the lack of location for
that user and the current time will likely mean that the user is at
home at night and in the office during the day, defeating the purpose
of the controls.
