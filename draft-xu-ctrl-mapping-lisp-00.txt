            Control Unit for Mapping System in LISP Networks
                     draft-xu-ctrl-mapping-lisp-00

Abstract

   EID-to-RLOC (Endpoint Identifier to Routing Locators) mapping system
   is one of the cornerstones for LISP (Location/Identifier Separation
   Protocol) networks.  This document suggests that one control unit
   could be included into mapping infrastructure to provide additional
   functions such as traffic engineering.

Internet-Draft    Ctrl Unit for Mapping System in LISP       August 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the control unit for mapping system, used by
   [LISP] networks.  The EID-to-RLOC mappings could be stored in a
   mapping database and be distributed to ITRs when needed.  One
   particular entry for one EID to one RLOC could be input into the
   database through manual configuration.  This document suggests that
   the mapping entry or entries could be adjusted according to other
   requirements such as interdomain as well as intradomain traffic
   engineering.  So Control Unit should be included in the mapping
   infrastructure.


2.  Control Unit in Mapping Infrastructure

   There are two main functions in control unit.  One is registering/
   unregistering EID-to-RLOC mapping in database.  Another is adjusting
   such mapping entries in database.  All these actions, registering,
   unregistering and adjusting could be initiated manually or
   automatically based on the network status for the traffic engineering
   purpose.
