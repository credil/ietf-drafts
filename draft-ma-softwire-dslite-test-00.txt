Internet-Draft                 TEST-RESULT                  October 2012


1.  Introduction

   With the exhaust of IPv4 address space, the deployment of IPv6 became
   imperative to the Internet service providers.Dual-Stack lite
   technology which defined in RFC6333 has the potential to be widely
   used in the IPv6 evoluation process.  In order to verify whether the
   existing equipments be able to support Dual-Stack lite technology,
   and meet the operational needs of network operators, it is necessary
   to test the various equipments and technical aspects involved in
   Dual-Stack lite.

   In this document, the content of Dual-stack deployment test is
   introduced fristly, after that, two problems about CPE devices found
   in the test are described, one is a few CPE devices's WAN interface
   can not support to achieve 128bits IPv6 Address by DHCPv6-NA, another
   is a few CPE devices handling jumbo frames with a different
   fragmentation manner compare to the definiton of RFC6333.


2.  Test overview

   Through test the functionality, performance, reliability and other
   aspects of B4, AFTR, CGN devices or function modules which invlved in
   dual-stack lite technology, the service provider be able to
   understand the technical maturity of the various equipment
   manufacturers, obtain the crisis data and technical support to the
   deployment of dual-stack lite.

   The test mainly include the following aspects:

   -functionality of dual-Stack lite, including obtain and distribute
   addresses, IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel, NAT ,application level gateway and
   other tests.

   - functionality of Radius, including authentication, accouting,
   recording extended attributes of NAT,tracing and other tests;

   - control policies, including the limit of ipv6 address ranges, limit
   of NAT sessions and other tests;

   - reliability test, including warm standy, hot standby of Address
   Family Transition Routers;

   - performance test, including the number of tunnels, the number of
   NAT sessions, forwarding performance and other tests;

   - DSLite+ NAT444 test,including deploy dual-stack lite and NAT444 at
   the same time, switching between dual-stack lite and NAT444, and

   other tests;


3.  test rusult of address assignment

   A dual-stack lite CPE is an IPv6-aware CPE with a B4 interface
   implemented in the WAN interface.  The IPv6 address of B4 element can
   be configured using several methods.  In the test, we used methods of
   neighbor discovery mechanism and DHCPv6 options.  The B4 element gets
   a 128-bit address by neighbor discovery negotiation, which is a
   directed link address and is usually different from the IPv6 prefix
   assigned by DHCPv6 prefix delegation (RFC 3633).  The result shows
   that all test equipment can support this function.  In the method of
   DHCPv6 options, the B4 element could directly get 128-bit global
   address in IA_NA option, or auto-configures a 128-bit address with
   the IPv6 prefix in the IA_PD option.  A DS-Lite CPE could share the
   same prefix pool with the hosts connecting the CPE.  The test result
   shows that some home gateways with FE ports cannot support the method
   of DHCPv6 IA_NA option.  That means some low-end CPEs don't support
   DHCPv6 well.

4.2.  Result Description

   Tester simulates end users which send IPv4 packets to remote, the CPE
   device encapsulates these IPv4 packets into IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel, then
   AFTR device decapsulates them and send the IPv4 packets to their
   destinations.  In the test scenarios, if the original IPv4 frame is
   larger than 1462bytes, it has to be fragmented when be transited in
   the IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel.  We found that there are some problems about
   a few provider's CPE devices, when the IPv4 larger than 1462bytes was
   transited by AFTR, it had not been reassembled, but the fragmented
   IPv4 packet were forwarded.

4.3.  Analysis

   After analyse the mirroring packets, we realized that the reason of
   the above phenomenon is a few CPE devices fragment the original IPv4
   packet into two smaller IPv4 packets, then encapsulates these packets
   into tunnel, and when those packets arrived at the AFTR, they were be
   decapsulated and transfered as the normal process.  The AFTR did not
   know the decapsulated IPv4 packets need to be reassembled.

   In the RFC6333 section 5.3, fragmentation and reassembly in the B4
   element had be defined as follow: The inner IPv4 packet MUST NOT be
   fragmented.  Fragmentation MUST happen after the encapsulation of the
   IPv6 packet.  Reassembly MUST happen before the decapsulation of the
   IPv4 packet.

   A few CPE devices did not accomplish the fragmentation function
   according the definition of RFC6333.  The fragmented IPv4 packets
   need to be reassembled by the final recipient, so an extra burden was
   bringed to the recipient.  Due to the fragmented IPv4 packet may be
   smaller than the handling requirement of some device in the transfer
   path, the packet could even be discarded.


5.  Security Considerations

   It needs to be further identified.


6.  IANA Considerations

   TBD
