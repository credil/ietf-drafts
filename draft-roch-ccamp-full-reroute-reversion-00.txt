1. Introduction and Problem Statement

   Carriers have expressed interest in supporting full-rerouting with
   reversion capability.  Additional clarification of how this can be
   supported within GMPLS is needed.

2. Basic Requirements

   We would like to be able to support of a version of rerouting that
   has the following characteristics:

   -  First the original LSP is established on demand.

   -  Secondly failure of the original LSP causes an alternate LSP to
   be created without any prior reservation of backup resources,
   potentially sharing some resources

   -  Finally, traffic reverts to the original LSP path once the
   failure is repaired.

3. Analysis of Current Text

   The authors would like to get clarifications on how the combination
   of reversion and rerouting is supported in GMPLS as current
   specifications are not very explicit about this.

   In our reading of [RFC4872], section 11, full LSP rerouting
   (protection type 0x01) involves tearing down the original LSP,
   although it says make-before-break can be used to establish the

   alternate LSP before tearing down the original, so that some of the
   resources can be reused.

   Rerouting without extra traffic (protection type 0x02) involves pre-
   establishment of the alternate LSP using a disjoint path, with no
   sharing of resources.

   We also found that section 12 on reversion describes how reversion
   is supported for 1+1 bidirectional protection, 1:n protection with
   extra traffic, and rerouting without extra traffic, but has no
   description for reversion for the full LSP rerouting case.

   It has been suggested that the decision to maintain the original LSP
   in the case of full LSP rerouting is made by the head-end despite
   the make-before-break terminology but we are concerned that this may
   lead to undefined behavior at the tail-end in case of multiple
   failures.

4. Example Scenario

   For example, let's consider the following network topology:

                     B --- C --- D
                   /               \
                  A --- E --- F --- Z
                   \               /
                     G --- H --- I



   If we start with an "original" connection A-B-C-D-Z that fails and
   is restored using "restoration 1" A-E-F-Z that later also fails and
   is restored to "restoration 2" A-G-H-I-Z. In networks where the SCN
   is congruent with the data path, the teardown of "original" and
   "restoration 1" connections may not reach the Z node until much
   later.


   If Z receives a request to establish "restoration 2" LSP A-G-H-I-Z,
   it may still have "original" LSP A-B-C-D-Z and "restoration 1" LSP
   A-E-F-Z in place if the teardown of either or both of them failed.
   If Z cannot determine how to setup the bridge/selector, it cannot
   accept the request. If Z was informed or the revertiveness of the
   LSP, it could make that determination based on the type. If it is
   revertive, bridge with "original", otherwise no bridge needed.

   It may be beneficial for this scenario and potentially other
   scenarios to distinguish between revertive and non-revertive full
   rerouting.
