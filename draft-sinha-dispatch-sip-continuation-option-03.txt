  The Continue Header Field for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
          draft-sinha-dispatch-sip-continuation-option-03.txt

Abstract

   Before placing a call, it is quite often useful for the Caller to
   know whether a Callee is in favorable state to receive a call or 
   not. This document defines an optional tag "continue" and a header
   "Continue" to address the purpose.  The "Continue" header field is
   to confirm the session continuity with the Callee from the Caller
   after an option for session continuity is placed by the Callee based
   on the unfavorable state of the Callee.  This functionality is needed
   to resolve the unwillingness of the Callee to receive any call. An
   option is given to the Callee by the Service Provider or by the
   Handset Manufacturer or by the Carrier to establish this requirement.

1. Introduction

   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows Caller to establish sessions
   with Callee without knowing whether Callee is in a position to accept
   session request or not.  There is no way by which Caller can know
   the favorable state of Callee.  There are several reasons why the
   Caller wants to know the favorable state of Callee before finally
   placing the call, because Callee may be in a different time zone,
   Callee may be in a meeting, theatre, having lunch with family/friends
   ,etc.  Callee may not want to be disturbed but may like to receive
   calls which is urgent and of good interest to him.  Another example
   Bob may not like office calls on weekends or at his personal/family
   time, but a project which requires his consent to progress or
   business gets affected can be treated as urgent and he would like to
   hear them.  Same in case he's in a business meeting and doesnot want 
   to receive call from family or his team but anything which requires
   his urgent attention, it would be important for him to accept.  The
   nearest approach or solutions to such problem available till date is
   described below along with the appropriate cause why this document is
   not considering this for implementation.  These approaches are not
   sufficient enough to address all concerns and not giving the control 
   on the call to the Caller for urgent call irrespective of Callee's 
   priority.

Internet-Draft              SIP Continuation Option           April 2012

   (a) By OPTION Method - It is used to determine the capabilities of 
       SIP User Agent (UA).  This OPTION method allows a SIP User Agent 
       Client (UAC) to discover information about the supported method, 
       content types, extensions, codec, etc for a client which is 
       registered with the Server. OPTION method is given by the Caller 
       to know either Server Capabilities or Client Capabilities and not
       to its callee's state.

   (b) By Priority Header - Priority Header can be used to override a
       ongoing call, DND option or any voice feature based on the 
       Priority of the call as set by the Caller and as agreed with the 
       Operator. If Called Party supports the feature and Caller does 
       not support Priority, then this feature will be just DND. 

   (c) By Do Not Disturb (DND) - When user enable DND on the phone, this
       parameter allows user to specify how the DND features handle
       incoming calls:

      (c.1) Call Reject - This option specifies that no incoming call
       information gets presented to the user.  Depending on how user
       configure the DND Incoming Call Alert parameter, the phone may
       play a beep or display a flash notification of the call.

      (c.2) Ringer Off - This option turns off the ringer, but incoming 
       call information gets presented to the device, so that the user 
       can accept the call.

      DND feature doesnot serve the requirement of Caller to make a call
      in diverted to voicemail. 

   (d) By Presence[1] Feature - The use of PRESENCE with UAC clients
       restricted to higher end-mobile devices. It is also not necessary 
       that caller and callee both are in each-other's buddy's list or 
       connected to same social-networks as it is not necessary that 
       call is between two known persons.

    Therefore the purpose of this document to give the control to the 
    Caller. It also describes a mechanism for a Callee to
    convey the information to a Caller to place a call only when call is
    urgent by introducing "Call Continuation Option" and "Non-Dedicated 
    Dot Not Disturb (NDDND)" as two new features in TELECOMMUNICATION.

Definition

    o Non-Dedicated Do Not Disturb (NDDND)- is a state of Callee which
      portrays that the Callee is in a non-dedicated or slight DND mode
      with willingness to receive calls only if it is urgent.  However
      the decision is driven by the Caller whether to finally place a
      call or not.  By setting this option at the Callee UE or at voice
      services of Callee on the operator side, it ensures that the

Internet-Draft              SIP Continuation Option           April 2012
	  
      Caller gets a notification after placing a call that Callee is
      in a unfavorable state to receive call at this moment but in a
      position to accept any call if caller thinks its urgent.

    o Call Continuation Option - is a feature where an option is given
      to the Caller after Caller dials the Callee number to confirm the
      application whether to finally place the call or not based on
      certain configuration at the Callee User Equipment (UE) or at the 
      Voice Feature Service of Callee.

1.1 Terminology

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
    this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119[5].

2. Overall Operation

   Callee is willing to receive only urgent call by enabling NDDND. This
   will convey the information to Caller that Callee is not in a 
   favorable state to receive calls and option will be given to the 
   Caller to place a call only if it is urgent. This can be achieved by 
   adding an optional tag "continue" in the Require header of 182 
   (Queued) provisional response from Callee. If Callee does not enable 
   this feature, operation will be as per RFC 3261[2].

   Caller is keen to know whether the Callee is free or not to take a
   call.  So Caller sends INVITE with option tag "continue" in the
   Supported header.  The Callee interprets the Caller up-to-date and 
   inline capabilities and responds with 182(Queued)response with 
   Require header value as "continue" if the feature NDDND is set at the
   Callee. This SIP response is interpreted at the Caller with a message
   popup or some in call information (device implementation) telling the
   unfavorable state of Callee to receive calls but tells its 
   availability state also with an "Y" or "N" which can also be 
   simulated by Call-Place GREEN Button or Call-Cancel RED Button 
   as per Caller wishes to perform the needful action. This is described
   in details in the mentioned use cases in Section 7. Accordingly PRACK
   [3] or UPDATE [4] with "Continue" header value as "Yes" (if 'Y' 
   option is selected or GREEN button is pressed)or "No" (if 'N' option 
   is selected) to be sent to Callee or the CANCEL request from Caller 
   will be initiated if Hard RED Button is pressed.

   The Caller will have following 3 options to the control session.

   (i) Continue: Yes

      Caller MUST inject "Continue" header with field value as "yes" or
      "YES" in the PRACK or UPDATE to support the Require header of 
      provisional response.

Internet-Draft              SIP Continuation Option           April 2012

   (ii) Continue: No

      Caller MUST inject "Continue" header with field value as "no"
      or "NO" in the PRACK or UPDATE to support the Require header of 
      provisional response.

   (iii) Caller Hungs Up

      CANCEL request is sent by Caller and call gets terminated as per 
      described in RFC 3261.

    Note-If the Caller does not act on received 182 (Queued) provisional
    responses, retransmission timer implemented as per RFC 3261.

3. UAS Behavior

   A UAS MAY send 182 (Queued) provisional (by adding Require header 
   field with the option tag "continue") response if the initial INVITE
   request contains a Supported header field with the option tag 
   "continue". If the UAS is unwilling to do so, it MUST ignore the 
   option tag "continue" and proceed as per guidelines described in RFC
   3261.

Internet-Draft              SIP Continuation Option           April 2012

   A UAS MUST send 182 (Queued) provisional (by adding Require header
   field with the option tag "continue") response if the initial INVITE
   request contained a Require header field with the option tag 
   "continue". If the UAS is unwilling to do so, UAS responds with 180 
   (Ringing) provisional response.

   A UAS MUST NOT send 182 (Queued) provisional (by adding Require 
   header field with the option tag "continue") response if the initial
   INVITE request did not include either a Supported or Require header 
   field indicating this feature.

   A UAS MUST NOT send 182 (Queued) provisional (by adding Require 
   header field with the option tag "continue") response if the initial
   INVITE request include Priority header with high value.

   If more than one "Continue" header field is present in PRACK or 
   UPDATE with two different field values, the UAS MUST reject the 
   request with a 400 (Bad Request) response.

   If a "Continue" header field is present in a request other than PRACK
   or UPDATE, the UAS MUST reject the request with a 400 (Bad Request)
   response.


4. UAC Behavior

   When the UAC creates a new request, it can insist for Call 
   Continuation Option in the provisional response for the request. To
   do that, it inserts a Require header with the value "continue" as
   option tag in the request. A Require header with the value "continue"
   MUST NOT be present in any requests except INVITE.

   If the UAC does not wish to insist on usage of Call Continuation
   Option in the provisional response, a Supported header MUST be
   include in the request with the option tag "continue". The UAC SHOULD
   include this in all INVITE requests.

   If a provisional response is received for an initial request and that
   response contains a Require header field containing the option tag
   "continue", the response is send in field value of "Continue" header 
   in PRACK or UPDATE request.

   If a provisional response is received for an initial request and that
   response contains a Require header field containing the option tag
   "continue" and UAC is unwilling to establish a session, it MUST 
   reject with CANCEL request.

5. The "Continue" Header Definition

Internet-Draft              SIP Continuation Option           April 2012

    The Call Continuation Option feature makes use of "Continue" header
    which provides control to Caller on establishing the session. It MAY
    appear as an option extension header in PRACK or UPDATE request of 
    the Call Continuation Option feature. 

    The syntax of "Continue" header field follows the standard SIP 
    parameter syntax.

          Continue = "Continue" HCOLON continue_value
          continue_value = "YES" / "yes" / "NO" / "no"

    For example, the used "Continue" header in SIP PRACK or UPDATE 
    request would look like

          Continue: "YES"
          Continue: "yes"
          Continue: "NO"
          Continue: "no"

    The information about "Continue" header field in this document in
    relation to method and proxy is summarized in Table 1.
 
    The "where" column, in the Table 1, describes the request and 
    response types in which the header field may be used. The header may
    not appear in other types of SIP messages. Values in the where 
    column is:

          R: header field may only appear in requests.

    The proxy column and last fourteen columns relate to the presence of
    a "Continue" header field in a method:


          o: the header field is optional.
          -: the header field is not applicable.


Header field where proxy ACK BYE CAN INV OPT REG PRACK REFER SUB NOT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Continue       R     -    -   -   -   -   -   -    o     -    -   -



Header field where                                   INF UPD MSG PUB
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Continue       R                                     -    o   -   -

6. Backwards Compatibility

   This feature or SIP implementation does not have any impact on
   existing Network designs and Handsets. This draft proposes the use of
   additional header called SIP "Continue" header in order to 
   incorporate this feature of NDDND.

   Handsets or Network who do not understand this feature shall not
   handle and normal SIP behavior follows as per RFC 3261.

   There are 2 use cases for backward compatibility:

   o Caller Not Updated, Callee Updated 

   o Caller Updated, Callee Not Updated 

   Handling of SIP messages for the above two mentioned scenarios are 
   clearly mentioned in Section 7.4 and Section 7.5 respectively.


7. Examples and Use cases

   This section contains a number of examples and use cases that
   illustrate the use of the "Continue" header field.  For simplicity,
   header fields are usually shown in the same order.  Usually only the
   minimum required header field set is shown.  Also, message body
   content lengths are often not calculated, but instead shown as "..."
   where the actual octet count would be.

   Messages are identified in the figures as F1, F2, F3, etc. This 
   references the message details in the table that follows the figure.
   
   Comments in the message details are shown in the following form:
   /* Comments. */

7.1 Call is Finally Placed by Calling Party

   In this scenario, Alice has enabled NDDND feature in her profile. Bob
   sends initial INVITE with option tag "continue" in Support header. 
   Alice asks for confirmation of urgent call before ringing by 182 
   (Queued) provisional response with option tag "continue" in Require
   header. Bob confirmed as urgent call by providing yes as "Continue"
   header field value.  Alice's phone rings finally.

7.4 Caller does not have Call Continuation Option feature

   There might be cases when Bob doesnot support "Continue" header
   but Alice has enabled NDDND feature.  In such a case Bob wouldnot be
   facilitated with continue advantages.  Bob sends initial INVITE
   without option tag "continue" in Support or Require header and will
   receive 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) responses.  Alice phone will
   not ring.

   NDDND feature will be overwritten and Alice phone ring if the initial
   INVITE request include Priority header with high value.  Basic
   intention of Alice is not to block urgent or emergency call but to
   avoid unimportant call as busy.

7.6 SIP-ISDN Interworking with Call Continuation feature

    In this scenario, ISDN terminal(Intelligent mode) has enabled
    NDDND feature in his/her profile.  SIP UAC sends initial INVITE
    with option tag "continue" in Support header.  ISDN terminal asks
    for confirmation of urgent call before ringing by sending Q 931
    Information Element (IE) in ISDN Facility message.  SIP UAC
    confirmed as urgent call by providing yes as "Continue" header
    field value.  ISDN terminal phone rings finally.

7.7 SIP-FXS Interworking with Call Continuation feature

    In this scenario, FXS phone (Intelligent mode) has enabled NDDDND
    NDDND feature in his/her analog-user-profile with dial-peer 
    configured for SIP-FXS call with route provisioned in Voice
    Gateway. SIP UAC sends initial INVITE with option tag "continue"
    in Support header. FXS phone asks for confirmation of urgent call
    call before ringing by sending FXS event-triggered Continue
    message. SIP UAC confirmed as urgent call by providing yes as 
    "Continue" header field value. FXS phone rings finally.

8. Implementation Recommendation

    "Session Continuation Option" feature in SIP is a new call control
    feature proposed in this document applicable in favour of Callee
    that gives option to Caller requesting for a confirmation to place
    a call to Callee based on the following new applications at the
    Callee.

   o    Callee unfavorable Time to Receive Call (usually when the
        Callee is sleeping or travelling, based on Callee time zone
        which is based on his location that needs to be updated by
        Callee in case of VoIP subscriber, and manually or 
        automatically done by Mobile Service Provider based on 
        Daylight Savings for 3G/4G subscriber).

   o    Callee has set a Non-Dedicated Do-Not-Disturb (NDDND) that is
        DND with lower priority when the Callee is in a theatre,
        meeting, driving, lunch/dinner, etc.  - Callee is willing to
        receive the call only when it is very urgent.

    This application is totally based on SIP Call Session 
    Establishment principles (Offer-Answer Model) with minor 
    deviation in call flows and is implementation specific and
    driven based on configuration at.

   o    SIP UA or Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) End Device, 
        3G/4G Handsets (Device Driven) - Device plays more important 
        role in Call Handling.

   o    SIP Back-To-Back User Agent (B2BUA) server as a part of Voice
        Feature Services given by the Service Provider (Service
        Provider Driven) - Network plays more important role in Call
        Handling instead of SIP Terminals or 3G/4G Handsets.

Internet-Draft              SIP Continuation Option           April 2012	
		
    This Call Feature Application handling behaviour and subsequent
    actions at the Calling and Callee and SIP AS is clearly defined
    later using State Diagrams based on the call confirmation options
    handled by Calling Party and relevant configurations / services
    provided by the Network Service Provider.

    This feature can be implemented using SIP with minor changes at
    protocol level by introducing "Continue" header in SIP PRACK
    Request and slight changes in the basic Offer-Answer Model
    implementation in both UAs and SIP AS based on implementation,
    calls of which are discussed in detail later on.  There will be an
    additional need of changes in UA Application and also at SIP AS in
    case this feature is driven by a SIP AS instead of Callee.

    This feature is fully backward compatible and doesnot have any
    impact on existing Subscribers, Devices, Network Setup and
    Operation.  The Service Provider may need to upgrade their SIP
    Application server in case they wish to give this new voice 
    feature as a new service to their subscribers.  Similarly Device
    Manufacturer needs to upgrade the application of their handsets or
    introduce as a new application feature in their new Handsets or
    Devices.

9. IANA Considerations

    This document registers a new header field name with a compact 
    form and one new option tag.

9.1  IANA Registration of "Continue" SIP Header field

    Name of Header:        Continue
    Compact Form:          g

9.2  IANA Registration of "continue" SIP Option-tag

    Name of option:         continue
    Description:            Support for the SIP Continue header.
	
10. Security Considerations

    The Continue header in this document does not in itself have 
    security considerations. However, as mentioned in RFC 3427[6], an 
    important reason for the IETF to manage the extensions of SIP is to 
    ensure that all extensions and parameters are able to provide secure
    usage.
