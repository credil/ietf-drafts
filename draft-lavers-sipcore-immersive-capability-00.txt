                in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
              draft-lavers-sipcore-immersive-capability-00

Abstract

   This document defines and registers with IANA the new 'immersive'
   media feature tag for use with the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).
   This media feature tag can be used to route calls to a device that
   can provide an immersive communication experience, such as a
   Telepresence system.

Internet-Draft         Immersive Media Feature Tag            March 2012


1.  Introduction

   Videoconferencing systems that utilize SIP [1] can be broadly
   classified as "traditional" videoconferencing systems or
   "Telepresence" systems.  Most SIP implementations today are
   classified as traditional videoconferencing systems, but there are a
   growing number of telepresence systems that would benefit in
   differentiating the two through a media feature tag.

   The traditional videoconferencing system, which might include any
   room-based system, desktop videophone, or application running on a
   computer, tablet, mobile phone, or similar device, typically uses
   lower-resolution video images and does not make an attempt to provide
   a real-life, immersive conferencing experience.  Some traditional
   systems do employ high definition (HD) video, but still lack the
   quality of providing an in-person communication experience.

   Telepresence systems, on the other hand, are visual conferencing
   environments that duplicate, as closely as possible, an in-person
   experience.  The objective of such systems is to make the
   participants in the conference feel as if they are physically
   together, providing an immersive, realistic experience.

   This document defines the "immersive" media feature tag for use in
   the SIP tree, as per Section 12.1 of RFC 3840 [RFC3840].  This
   feature tag can be utilized by SIP B2BUAs, SIP proxies, or other
   elements in the SIP network to help ensure the best communication
   experience for those wishing to establish a telepresence session or
   other communication session that might be classified as providing an
   immersive, realistic user experience.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", and "NOT RECOMMENDED" are
   appropriate when valid exceptions to a general requirement are known
   to exist or appear to exist, and it is infeasible or impractical to
   enumerate all of them.  However, they should not be interpreted as
   permitting implementors to fail to implement the general requirement
   when such failure would result in interoperability failure.

3.  Motivation

   The primary motivation for defining an immersive media feature tag is
   for the transmission of a feature capability that implies a specific
   "user experience" that is differentiated from classic video.  This
   feature tag can be considered by the various network elements to
   realize several possible use cases.  To name a few:

   o  Admission control decisions: A system could use the media feature
      tags such as immersive, video, audio, etc. to allow network
      elements to reserve bandwidth or take measures to ensure the best
      possible experience.

   o  Selective routing decisions: A proxy or B2BUA could leverage the
      immersive feature tag to help make routing decisions, including
      the selection of a specific end system that supports the feature
      capability or to route a call over specific network segments.


4.  Examples

   The following examples omit the message body and various header
   fields for brevity.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations related to the use of media feature tags
   from Section 11.1 of RFC 3840 [RFC3840] apply.

Internet-Draft         Immersive Media Feature Tag            March 2012


6.  IANA Considerations

   This specification adds a new media feature tag to the SIP Media
   Feature Tag Registration Tree per the procedures defined in RFC 2506
   [RFC2506] and RFC 3840 [RFC3840].

   Media feature tag name:  sip.immersive

   ASN.1 Identifier:  1.3.6.1.8.4.{PH}

   Summary of the media feature indicated by this tag:  This feature tag
      indicates that the device provides an immersive audio and/or video
      communication experience.

   Values appropriate for use with this feature tag:  Boolean.

   The feature tag is intended primarily for use in the following
   applications, protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms:   This
      feature tag is most useful in a communications application for
      describing the capabilities of a device, such as a Telepresence
      system.

   Examples of typical use:  Routing a call to a multimedia
      communication system that can provide an immersive communication
      experience.

   Related standards or documents:  RFCXXXX

   Security Considerations:  Security considerations for this media
      feature tag are discussed in Section 5 of this document.

   [[NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: Please change {PH} above to the correct
   identifier for this entry in the IANA registry for
   iso.org.dod.internet.features.sip-tree (1.3.6.1.8.4)]]

   [[NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: Please change XXXX to the number assigned to
   this specification, and remove this paragraph on publication.]]
