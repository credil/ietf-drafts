Abstract

   In the current Internet, it is implicitly assumed that a network node
   is always active so that it can receive the incoming packets at any
   time.  Current networking services and applications are commonly
   designed to be fully available at all times with minimal response
   times.  This assumption keeps network nodes from entering sleeping
   mode in order to reduce energy consumption.  Further, during sleeping
   mode, network nodes may not immediately respond to the incoming
   packets or even lose them.  If network nodes are allowed to go into a
   sleeping mode, they can effectively reduce energy consumption during
   idle period.  Network proxy allows to delegate network node's traffic
   processing to an external system within a network, so that the nodes
   maintain network presence during their sleep.  This document
   describes communication mechanism between network nodes and proxy in
   order to accelerate the wider deployment of network proxy mechanism.

1.  Introduction

   Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector is facing
   rapid growth and consuming a lot of power in order to provide large
   bandwidth and complex application services.

   According to an ITU-T report, wired and wireless networks consume
   large amount of power and the amount of green-house gas emissions
   caused by ICT sector is estimated 2% of total man-made emissions.  It
   is also estimated that network sector including network equipment and
   equipment connected to networks contributes to 4% of world power
   consumption.  Further, it is observed that the power consumption is
   higher at access networks and users, so how to reduce the power
   consumption in these areas is becoming an important issue [ITU].

   According to recent surveys, network equipment show a constant power
   consumption profile irrespective of their utilization level, i.e.,
   energy-agnostic power profile.  Such equipment represent the worst
   case in terms of utilization and power consumption profile.  On the
   contrary, ideally, energy-aware equipment represent power consumption
   pattern proportional to their utilization or offered load.  Practical
   approaches for realizing the energy-aware equipment are implementing
   multi-stepped power profiles in order to adapt to the utilization
   level [EPC][GreenSurvey][EEE].

   There is another researh direction for improving energy efficiency of
   network equipment using network proxy technology
   [I-D.winter-energy-efficient-internet][PROXZZZY][NCP].  Network proxy
   describes technologies that maintain network connectivity for other
   devices so that these can go into low power sleep modes.  This mainly
   targets the reduction of unnecessary energy waste through edge
   devices.

   There are typically two types of network proxies: internal and
   external, respectively.

   o  Internal Proxy: proxy functionality is implemented within the ICT
      product, such as network interface card.

   o  External Proxy: proxy functionality is placed within other network
      equipment such as switch and external server in networks.

   This document describes a protocol that is need for communication
   between external proxies and network hosts.

   ECMA International has published a proxying document [PROXZZZY].
   This specification describes an overall architecture for network
   proxying and provides capabilities that a proxy may expose to a host.

   Also, information that must be exchanged between a host and a proxy,
   and required and optional behavior of a proxy during its operation
   are described.

   Within IETF, there are several documents related with the
   functionality of network proxy
   [RFC6762][RFC6763][I-D.cheshire-edns0-owner-option].  These documents
   defines DNS messages-based service discovery mechanisms, which can be
   used for facilitating various services.  These mechanisms may be used
   for providing some of network proxy functionality, but generalized
   network proxy functionality is not fully supported.

   Generalized network proxy is capable of providing full network
   presence for a broad range of network protocols and applications.
   The generalized network proxy include a list of packet types that may
   require routine reply, autogeneration, and wakeup, as well as the
   detailed steps and methods for state information transfer each
   requires [EEEC].

   It is well known that many network hosts are in active state in order
   to maintain network presence and this behavior hinders hosts from
   entering energy saving state.  Even when a node is idle with no
   running applications, background traffic is received that needs to be
   processed which inhibits the node from sleeping.  Network proxy is
   one of the possible solutions for resolve this issue.  The general
   framework of network proxy was developed, but the control and
   communication mechanisms between network hosts and proxies has not
   been developed.  Thus, in order to promote the wider deployment of
   network proxy mechanism, the control and communication protocol
   should be specified.

   This document defines a control protocol for external network proxy
   operation and relevant messages in order to increase energy
   efficiency of network hosts.

3.  Overview of Network Proxy

   Network proxy refers to a set of mechanisms dedicated to put network
   interfaces and network nodes into energy saving sleeping mode.
   Energy consumption in sleeping mode is less than active mode in
   general, so the longer the sleeping periods is, the higher the
   achievable energy saving can be.  The network proxy enables network
   nodes to maintain network connectivity during sleep period.  Figure 1
   shows the typical operational scenario of network proxy [PROXZZZY].
   When a host wants to enter sleeping mode, the host delivers its
   network status and state to a network proxy and goes into sleeping
   mode.  Then, the network proxy responds to periodic messages on
   behalf of the host in sleeping mode.  If the proxy receives a message
   that it cannot process, it sends a wake-up message to the host so
   that the host can process the message after wake-up.

              Figure 1: Operational scenario of network proxy

   According to the survey, even though a host is in idle mode,
   background network traffic is received and needs to be processed,
   which prevents the host from going into sleeping mode.  Also, it is
   known that most of the incoming traffic received during the host's
   idle period may be simply dropped or do not require more than a
   minimal computation and response.  For instance, most broadcast
   packets or traffic related to port scanning may simply be ignored.

   Usual exchanges, such as Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
   processing, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo answering
   or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) rebinding, are simple
   tasks that could be easily performed directly by network proxy.  The
   idea behind network proxy is delegating the processing of such
   traffic.  Processing can imply plain filtering or may require simple
   responses (e.g., in the case of ARP, ICMP, DHCP), or even more
   complex task.  Such tasks can be delegated from the CPUs of hosts to
   an external network proxy in networks [GreenSurvey].

   The following list summarizes requirement status about what types of
   protocols network proxy should support [PROXZZZY].  Among them, this
   document describes ARP related operation first and other mandatory
   protocols will be defined later version of this document.

   Mandatory 1:  Media (802.3, 802.11)

   Mandatory 2:  IPv4 ARP

   Mandatory 3:  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery

   Mandatory 4:  Wake Packets

   Option 1:  DNS

   Option 2:  DHCP

   Option 3:  IGMP

   Option 4:  MLD

   Option 5:  Remote Access using SIP and IPv4

   Option 6:  Remote Access using Teredo for IPv6

   Option 7:  SNMP

   Option 8:  Service Discovery using mDNS

   Option 9:  Name Resolution with LLMNR

4.  Network Proxy Operation

   This section describes network proxy operation between proxy server
   and network nodes to support mandatory protocols.  Figure 2 shows
   network proxy operations for IPv4 ARP.  When a network host wants to
   enter sleeping mode in order to save energy, the host exchanges Proxy
   Solicitation and Advertisement messages with network proxy in
   network.  Proxy may be implemented as a function within a switch or
   router, or it may be implemented as a separate server.  Proxy
   Solicitation message queries to network, whether network proxy
   functionality can be supported within the host's network.  If there
   is a network proxy that can provide proxy functionality, it replies
   to the host by using Proxy Advertisement message.  Network proxy
   supports required functional behavior defined in [PROXZZZY] in order
   to support IPv4 ARP.

   After the network proxy discovery procedure, the host sends Sleep
   Request message to network proxy.  The Request message contains the
   host's MAC address(es) and IP address(es).  After receiving the Sleep
   Confirm message from the network proxy, the host enters sleeping
   mode.  Then the network proxy discards ARP Request messages sent from
   other hosts in the network.  By doing so, the host can sleep without
   receiving or processing ARP broadcast message not destined to the
   node itself.  If the network proxy receives an ARP request message
   for sleeping host, it sends a reply message on behalf of the sleeping
   hosts using the host's MAC and IP address.  When the network proxy
   receives a packet that it cannot process, the proxy sends a Wake-up
   packet to the sleeping host in order to wake it up.  During its
   wake-up process, proxy may buffer additional packets destined to the
   sleeping hosts.  After the sleeping node wakes up it can communicate
   with remote hosts.  When Sleep Timer expires, the sleeping host wakes
   up and sends a Wake-up Report message to the network proxy.  Then,
   the network proxy cleans up the state information for the sleeping
   host and replies with Wake-up confirm message.

   Note that Figure 2 shows network proxy operation for processing ARP
   messages and operation for other mandatory protocols specified in
   [PROXZZZY] will be defined later version of this document.
