Internet-Draft              Internet Ciphers                  March 2012


1.  Introduction

   This note is a catalog of the ciphers in use on the Internet, and/or
   defined or referenced in IETF RFCs.

   This note is not a standards document; instead it aims to capture the
   consensus of the Cryto Forum Research Group at the time of
   publication, and to provide technical guidance to standards groups
   that are selecting ciphers.

   This note groups together ciphers with similar block structure, and
   lists ciphers in decreasing order of the year of their publication.

   This is the initial version of this note; it is a work in progress,
   and it should not yet be considered as representative of any
   consensus.  Comments are solicited and should be sent to the authors
   and to cfrg@irtf.org.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Background

   A cipher is an encryption method.  Encryption is a transformation of
   data that uses a secret key to change a plaintext value, which needs
   to be kept secret, into a ciphertext value, which can be safely
   revealed without the loss of the confidentiality of the plaintext.
   Ciphertext can be converted back into plaintext, through the use of
   the secret key, via a decryption algorithm that is the reverse of the
   encryption algorithm.  Importantly, encryption does not protect the
   integrity or authenticity of the plaintext; it does not provide a
   data integrity service, or a data origin authentication service
   [RFC4949].

   Authenticated Encryption is an encryption method that does protect
   the integrity and authenticity of the plaintext, as well as the
   confidentiality of the plaintext.  Authenticated Encryption with
   Associated Data (AEAD) protects the confidentiality, integrity, and
   authenticity of the plaintext, and also protects the integrity and
   authenticity of some associated data [RFC5116].

   A Block Cipher is an encryption algorithm that encrypts a fixed-size
   plaintext block with a secret key, resulting in a fixed-size
   ciphertext block.  The encryption is reversible, so that the

Internet-Draft              Internet Ciphers                  March 2012


   plaintext block can be computed from the key and the ciphertext
   block.  Block ciphers are not directly used to encrypt data, but
   instead are used in a mode of operation, as described below.  A block
   cipher has two parameters: block size (the number of bits in the
   fixed-size blocks), and key size (the number of bits in the key).
   Some block ciphers accept different key sizes.

   A Block Cipher Mode of Operation is a method for encrypting and/or
   authenticating data.  Most modes of operation can operate on
   arbitrary-length data, unlike the block cipher itself, which can only
   operate on fixed length data.  The mode of operation logically breaks
   plaintext into fixed-size blocks, and processes these blocks using
   the block cipher (and other operations such as bitwise exclusive-or).

   A Stream Cipher is an encryption method that does not use a block
   cipher, and is not used in a mode of operation; instead, the stream
   cipher defines its own encryption method.  Most stream ciphers
   encrypt plaintext by generating pseudorandom data with a secret key,
   then bitwise exclusive-oring the pseudorandom data with the plaintext
   to produce the ciphertext.  Some stream ciphers take an
   Initialization Vector (IV) as input; a different IV is provided to
   the cipher for each different message that is encrypted.  A stream
   cipher has two parameters: IV size (the number of bits in the IV),
   and key size (the number of bits in the key).  Some stream ciphers
   accept different key sizes.

2.1.  Attack Models

   There are many different attack models that are used to analyze the
   security of ciphers.  An attack model is a formal statement of the
   attacker's capabilities.  A particular cipher may be strong in one
   attack model, but weak in another; the suitability of that cipher for
   use in a particular application will depend entirely on the
   attacker's actual capabilities in the real world.

   In a Known-Plaintext Attack (KPA), the attacker knows some of the
   plaintexts that encrypted, and can learn the resulting ciphertexts.
   The attacker can observe the ciphertext resulting from the encryption
   of some unknown plaintexts, and observe the ciphertext resulting from
   the encryption of some plaintexts of its choice.

   In a Chosen-Plaintext Attack (CPA), the attacker can choose the
   plaintexts that encrypted, and can learn the resulting ciphertexts.
   The attacker can observe the ciphertext resulting from the encryption
   of some unknown plaintexts, and can cause the encryption of some
   plaintexts of its choice, and can observe the resulting ciphertexts.
   A CPA is adaptive if the attacker can adapt the plaintexts that it
   chooses based on other data that it observes.

Internet-Draft              Internet Ciphers                  March 2012


   In a Chosen-Ciphertext Attack (CCA), the attacker can cause the
   decryption of some ciphertexts of its choice, and can learn the
   results of those decryptions.  The attacker can also observe the
   ciphertext resulting from the encryption of some unknown plaintexts.
   A CCA is adaptive if the attacker can adapt the ciphertexts that it
   chooses based on other data that it observes.  (Authenticated
   Encryption protects against these attacks.)

   In a Related-Key Attack (RKA), the attacker can cause the encryption
   of unknown plaintext values under two or more keys, where the
   relationship between the keys is known to the attacker, but the
   actual value of the keys is not known.  For example, if keys K1 and
   K2 are in use, the attacker might know the value of the bitwise
   exclusive-or of K1 and K2, while not knowing the value of either key.
   Related-Key Attacks do not have any effect on security when keys are
   chosen independently, as is the case in most security protocols.  It
   is unclear that it is a reasonable theoretical goal for a cipher to
   be resistant to RKAs.

   In a Side-Channel Attack (SCA), the attacker has access to physical
   side information beyond the digital representation of the plaintexts
   and ciphertexts, such as the voltage levels used during the
   encryption process, or fine-grained timing information about the
   duration of the encryption operations.  Side-Channel Attacks act
   against an implementation of a cipher, rather than against the cipher
   itself, since the side information is a property of an implementation
   and not of a cipher design.

   In a Key Recovery Attack (KRA), the attacker learns the secret key
   that is used to encrypt some ciphertext.  In a Plaintext Recovery
   Attack (PRA), the attacker learns some unknown plaintext, but does
   not learn the secret key.  A successful KRA is devastating, but a
   successful PRA can also be quite damaging.

2.2.  Security Goals

   An encryption method is indistinguishable from random whenever its
   ciphertext cannot be distinguished from a random value by a
   computationally limited adversary.  This idea has been mathematically
   formalized, and is fundamental to the analysis of ciphers.  A cipher
   cannot be secure unless it is indistinguishable, and thus, this is
   the main security goal.

   Typical block cipher modes of operation are insecure when the amount
   of data processed by a single key is larger than w * 2^(w/2) bits,
   where w is the block size of the block cipher.  (Here and below 2^w
   denotes 2 to the power w.)  This limit is called the birthday bound,
   by analogy to the fact that, in a group of people, a birthday common



McGrew & Shen           Expires September 6, 2012               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              Internet Ciphers                  March 2012


   to two people is more likely than one might expect.  The birthday
   bound is a primary consideration for the security of block ciphers.
   Above the birthday bound, all of the block cipher modes of operation
   that are in common use are distinguishable from random, and are
   vulnerable to plaintext recovery attacks.

      The bound for a 64-bit block cipher is 2^34 bytes, or 4 Gigabytes,
      and

      The bound for a 128-bit block cipher is 2^67 bytes, or 128
      Trillion Gigabytes.

   In practice, it is highly desirable that the amount of data is
   significantly below the birthday bound, in order to make the
   likelihood of a successful plaintext recovery attack negligible.

   It is highly desirable that a block cipher be indistinguishable from
   random even if the attacker knows most of the 2^w possible w-bit
   plaintext/ciphertext pairs for a given key.  However, because of the
   birthday bound, a block cipher should not be used to encrypt more
   than 2^(w/2) plaintexts, and attacks against a block cipher that
   require more than 2^(w/2) plaintexts or ciphertexts may have no
   effect on the practical security of that cipher.


3.  Guidance

   It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that any cipher used be secure in the KPA,
   adaptive CPA, and adaptive CCA models.  The security against this
   type of attack is determined by the cipher design.

   It is RECOMMENDED that any implementation of a cipher be secure in
   the SCA model, and it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that any implementation
   that must operate while in the physical possession of an attacker be
   secure in the SCA model.  The security against this type of attack is
   determined by the particulars of the implementation, and not the
   design of the cipher.  However, a specific cipher design may be
   easier to implement such that it is secure in the SCA model, compared
   to other ciphers.

   When encryption is in use, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that either 1)
   Authenticated Encryption or AEAD be used, or 2) an encryption method
   be used in conjunction with an algorithm that protects the
   authenticity of the data, such as a Message Authentication Code
   [RFC4949].

   64-bit block ciphers SHOULD NOT be used, because of the plaintext
   recovery attacks that are possible against them.  When a 64-bit block



McGrew & Shen           Expires September 6, 2012               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft              Internet Ciphers                  March 2012


   cipher is used for legacy reasons, it is RECOMMENDED that the amount
   of data encrypted by a single key is 1 Megabyte.

3.1.  AES Compatibility

   At present, the most widely used cipher is the Advanced Encryption
   Standard (see Section Section 4.7), which is believed to provide
   adequate security for the foreseeable future.  It has a block size of
   128 bits, and key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.  We say that a
   cipher is AES-compatible if it supports the same block and key sizes,
   and that a cipher is partially AES-compatible if it supports the same
   block size and at least one of the key sizes.

   AES-compatible ciphers include ARIA, CAST-256, Camellia, Serpent, and
   Twofish.  Partly-AES-compatible ciphers include SEED and SMS4, both
   of which only support 128 bit keys.  All of these ciphers, except for
   SMS4, are either free from intellectual property claims, or are
   available worldwide royalty free.

   The existence of strong ciphers that are free of intellectual
   property restrictions shows that it is not necessary to use
   encumbered ciphers in order to obtain good security.


4.  128-bit Block Ciphers

4.1.  ARIA

   ARIA was first published in 2003 [NBC:KKP03] by a large group of
   South Korean researchers.  It is specified in [RFC5794], and supports
   a keys length of 128 bits, 192 bits, and 256 bits.

   IETF use includes 21 RFCs and 11 Internet Drafts.

   Intellectual Property Rights have not been claimed on ARIA.

   Attack: The best known attack against this cipher is meet-in-the-
   middle attack on 8 rounds with data complexity 2^56.It was shown in
   [MMA:TSLL10].  Analysis: Classical linear and differential
   cryptanalysis were shown in [SPAA:BC03].  Truncated
   differentials,boomerang and slide attack were shown in [SPAA:BC03].
   New Boomerang Attacks on ARIA was shown in [INDOCRYPT:FFGL10].
   Impossible Differential Cryptanalysis was shown in [CANS:DuChe10].
   The Smallest ARIA Module with 16-Bit Architecture was shown in
   [ICISC:YanParYou06].  Investigations of Power Analysis Attacks and
   Countermeasures for ARIA was shown in [WISA:YHMOM06].

   ARIA is designed by a large group of South Korean researchers.  In

Internet-Draft              Internet Ciphers                  March 2012


   2004, the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards selected it as a
   standard cryptographic technique.  The algorithm uses a SPN structure
   based on AES.  The interface is the same as AES.  The number of
   rounds is 12, 14, or 16, depending on the key sizes.  ARIA uses two
   8*8-bit S-boxes and their inverses in alternate rounds; one of these
   is the Rijndael S-box.  The key schedule processes the key using a
   3-round 256-bit Feistel cipher.

4.2.  CLEFIA

   CLEFIA was first published in 2007 [BC:SSAMI07],[FSE:SSAMI07].  It is
   specified in [RFC6114], and supports keys lengths of 128, 192, and
   256.

   IETF uses include 1 RFC, which specifies the cipher, and 2 Internet
   Drafts, defining its use in IPsec and TLS.

   Intellectual Property Rights have been claimed on CLEFIA.  The owner
   of those rights is SONY.

   Attack: The best known attack against this cipher is requiring
   2^126.83 chosen plaintexts breaks 13 rounds with a complexity of
   2^126.83 encryptions for the key size of length 128 bits (Tezcan,
   2010).  Similar attacks apply for 14 and 15 rounds of CLEFIA for the
   key sizes 192 and 256 bits,respectively.  The Improbable Differential
   Attack: Cryptanalysis of Reduced Round CLEFIA was shown in
   [INDOCRYPT:Tezcan10].  Analysis: This cipher has been analyzed by
   differential cryptanalysis,linear cryptanalysis.  Impossible
   Differential Cryptanalysis was shown in [IDCC:TTSSSK08].
   Cryptanalysis of CLEFIA Using Differential Methods with Cache Trace
   Patterns was shown in [RSA:RebMuk11].  Differential Fault Analysis on
   CLEFIA was shown in [ICICS:CheWuFen07].

   CLEFIA has rounds of 18, 22, or 16.  It is intended to be used in DRM
   systems.

4.3.  SMS4

   CIPHER was first published in 2006.  It is specified in [SMS4], and
   supports a keys length of 128 bits.

   There are no IETF uses yet.

   Intellectual Property Rights have been claimed on SMS4.  The owner of
   those rights is BDST.

   Attack: The best known attack against this cipher is linear and
   differential attacking 22 rounds, which was shown in [LDC:KKHS08].

   Rectangle and impossible differential attack were shown in [AARRS:
   DT08].  Attacking Reduced-Round Versions of the SMS4 Block Cipher in
   the Chinese WAPI Standard was shown in [ICICS:Lu07].  Analysis:
   Cryptanalysis of Reduced-Round SMS4 Block Cipher was shown in [ACISP:
   ZhaZhaWu08],[SAC:EtrRob08].  An Analysis of the Compact XSL Attack on
   BES and Embedded SMS4 was shown in [CANS:ChoYapKho09].  Analysis of
   Two Attacks on Reduced-Round Versions of the SMS4 was shown in
   [ICICS:TozDun08].  Algebraic Cryptanalysis of SMS4 was shown in
   [ICISC:EriDinChr09].  New Description of SMS4 by an Embedding over
   GF(2^8) was shown in [INDOCRYPT:JiHu07].  Parallelizing the Camellia
   and SMS4 Block Ciphers was shown in [AFRICACRYPT:YapKhoPos10].

   SMS4 is used in the Chinese National Standard for Wireless LAN
   WAPI.SMS4 was a proposed cipher to be used in IEEE 802.11i
   standard,but so far been rejected by ISO.One of the reasons for the
   rejection has been opposition to the WAPI fast-track proposal by the
   IEEE.  SMS4 uses an 8-bit S-box,performs 32 rounds to process one
   block.A non-linear key schedule is used to produce the round keys.

4.4.  SEED

   SEED was first published in 1998.  It is specified in [RFC4269], and
   supports a key length of 128 bits.

   IETF use includes 7 RFCs and 1 Internet Draft, which specify the
   cipher and define its use in CMS, TLS, IPsec, SRTP, and MIKEY.

   Intellectual Property Rights have not been claimed on SEED.

   Attack: The best known attack against this cipher is an exhaustive
   search for the key.  Differential and linear attack were shown in
   [DC:YS03], [SKES:WMF03].  Analysis: Differential Cryptanalysis of a
   Reduced-Round SEED was shown in [SCN:YanShi02].  Side Channel
   Cryptanalysis on SEED was shown in [WISA:YKHMP04].

   SEED is developed by the Korean Information Security Agency.It is
   used broadly throughout South Korean industry,but seldom found
   elsewhere.It gained popularity in Korea because 40-bit SSL was not
   considered strong enough (see 40-bit encryption), so the Korean
   Information Security Agency developed its own standard.However, this
   decision has historically limited the competition of web browsers in
   Korea.  SEED is a 16-round Feistel network with 128-bit blocks.  It
   uses two 8 !A 8 S-boxes which, like those of SAFER, are derived from
   discrete exponentiation (in this case, x247 and x251 "C plus some
   "incompatible operations").  It also has some resemblance to MISTY1
   in the recursiveness of its structure: the 128-bit full cipher is a
   Feistel network with an F-function operating on 64-bit halves, while
   the F-function itself is a Feistel network composed of a G-function

Internet-Draft              Internet Ciphers                  March 2012


   operating on 32-bit halves.  However the recursion does not extend
   further because the G-function is not a Feistel network.  In the
   G-function, the 32-bit word is considered as four 8-bit bytes, each
   of which is passed through one or the other of the S-boxes, then
   combined in a moderately complex set of boolean functions such that
   each output bit depends on 3 of the 4 input bytes.  SEED has a fairly
   complex key schedule, generating its thirty-two 32-bit subkeys
   through application of its G-function on a series of rotations of the
   raw key, combined with round constants derived (as in TEA) from the
   Golden ratio.

   for 128-Bit Block Ciphers AES and Camellia was shown in [CHES:
   SatMor03].  Automatic Search for Related-Key Differential
   Characteristics in Byte-Oriented Block Ciphers was shown in [EC:
   BirNik10].  Hardware-Focused Performance Comparison for the Standard
   Block Ciphers AES Camellia,and Triple-DES was shown in [ISC:
   SatMor03].  New Observation on Camellia was shown in [SAC:
   LeiChaFen05].

   Camellia is a 128-bit block cipher jointly developed by Mitsubishi
   and NTT.  The cipher has been approved for use by the ISO/IEC, the
   European Union's NESSIE project and the Japanese CRYPTREC project.
   The cipher has security levels and processing abilities comparable to
   the Advanced Encryption Standard.Camellia's block size is 16 bytes
   (128 bits).The block cipher was designed to be suitable for both
   software and hardware implementations, from low-cost smart cards to
   high-speed network systems.  Camellia is a Feistel cipher with either
   18 rounds or 24 rounds.  Every six rounds, a logical transformation
   layer is applied: the so-called "FL-function" or its inverse.
   Camellia uses four 8 x 8-bit S-boxes with input and output affine
   transformations and logical operations.  The cipher also uses input
   and output key whitening.  The diffusion layer uses a linear
   transformation based on an MDS matrix with a branch number of 5.

4.6.  CAST-256

   CAST-256 was first published in 1998 in [EA:C98].  It is specified in
   [RFC2612], and supports keys lengths 128, 160, 192, 224 and 256.

   IETF use is RFC 2612, which defines the cipher.

   Intellectual Property Rights have been claimed on CAST-256 by
   Entrust.  According to RFC 2612, it "is available worldwide on a
   royalty-free and license-free basis for commercial and non-
   commercial uses."

   Attack: The best known attack against this cipher is linear attack.
   Analysis: Differential and linear cryptanalysis was shown in [CA:
   AHTW99].  Higher Order Differential Attack of CAST Cipher was shown
   in [FSE:MorShiKan98].  Related-key cryptanalysis of 3-WAY Biham-
   DES,CAST DES-X, NewDES, RC2, and TEA was shown in [ICICS:
   KelSchWag97].  New Linear Cryptanalytic Results of Reduced-Round of
   CAST-128 and CAST-256 was shown in [SAC:WamWanHu08].

   CAST-256 (or CAST6) is a block cipher.  It was submitted as a
   candidate for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES); however, it was
   not among the five AES finalists.  It is an extension of an earlier
   cipher, CAST-128; both were designed according to the "CAST" design
   methodology invented by Carlisle Adams and Stafford Tavares.  Howard

   Heys and Michael Wiener also contributed to the design.  CAST-256
   uses the same elements as CAST-128, including S-boxes, but is adapted
   for a block size of 128 bits !a twice the size of its 64-bit
   predecessor.  (A similar construction occurred in the evolution of
   RC5 into RC6).CAST-256 is composed of 48 rounds, sometimes described
   as 12 "quad-rounds", arranged in a generalised Feistel network.

Internet-Draft              Internet Ciphers                  March 2012


   (AES) is a specification for the encryption of electronic data.  It
   has been adopted by the U.S. government and is now used worldwide.
   AES was announced by National Institute of Standards and Technology
   (NIST) as U.S. FIPS PUB 197 (FIPS 197) on November 26, 2001 after a
   five-year standardization process in which fifteen competing designs
   were presented and evaluated before it was selected as the most
   suitable.  It became effective as a Federal government standard on
   May 26, 2002 after approval by the Secretary of Commerce.  It is
   available in many different encryption packages.  AES is the first
   publicly accessible and open cipher approved by the National Security
   Agency (NSA) for top secret information.  Originally called Rijndael,
   the cipher was developed by two Belgian cryptographers, Joan Daemen
   and Vincent Rijmen, and submitted by them to the AES selection
   process.  AES is based on a design principle known as a substitution-
   permutation network.  It is fast in both software and hardware.  AES
   operates on a 4!A4 column-major order matrix of bytes, termed the
   state (versions of Rijndael with a larger block size have additional
   columns in the state).  Most AES calculations are done in a special
   finite field.The AES cipher is specified as a number of repetitions
   of transformation rounds that convert the input plaintext into the
   final output of ciphertext.  Each round consists of several
   processing steps, including one that depends on the encryption key.
   A set of reverse rounds are applied to transform ciphertext back into
   the original plaintext using the same encryption key.

4.8.  Twofish

   Twofish was first published in 1998.  It is specified in [Twofish],
   and supports keys lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits.

   IETF use include 9 RFCs, that specify its use in OpenPGP, SSH, and
   ZRTP.

   Intellectual Property Rights have not been claimed on Twofish.

   Attack: The best known attack against this cipher is truncated
   differential attack,which was shown in [TC:MY00].  Truncated
   differential,impossible differential attack that breaks was shown in
   [TC:MY00].  The Saturation Attack - A Bait for Twofish was shown in
   [FSE:Lucks01].  Analysis: Improved Impossible Differentials on
   Twofish was shown in [INDOCRYPT:BihFur00].  On the Twofish Key
   Schedul was shown in [SAC:SKWWH98].

   Twofish is a symmetric key block cipher with a block size of 128
   bits.  It was one of the five finalists of the Advanced Encryption
   Standard contest, but was not selected for standardisation.  Twofish
   is related to the earlier block cipher Blowfish.  Twofish's

   S-boxes, and a relatively complex key schedule.Twofish borrows some
   elements from other designs; for example, the pseudo-Hadamard
   transform (PHT) from the SAFER family of ciphers.  Twofish uses the
   same Feistel structure as DES.  On most software platforms Twofish
   was slightly slower than Rijndael for 128-bit keys, but somewhat
   faster for 256-bit keys.  Twofish was designed by Bruce Schneier,
   John Kelsey, Doug Whiting, David Wagner, Chris Hall, and Niels
   Ferguson; Twofish algorithm is free for anyone to use without any
   restrictions whatsoever.  It is one of a few ciphers included in the
   OpenPGP standard (RFC 4880).  However, Twofish has seen less
   widespread usage than Blowfish, which has been available longer.

   Serpent was a finalist in the AES contest,where it came second to
   Rijndael.Serpent was designed by Ross Anderson,Eli Biham,and Lars
   Knudsen.  Serpent was widely viewed as taking a more conservative
   approach to security than the other AES finalists, opting for a
   larger security margin: the designers deemed 16 rounds to be
   sufficient against known types of attack, but specified 32 rounds as

5.9.  Data Encryption Standard (DES)

   DES was first published in 1977.  It is specified in [FIPS-46], and
   its key length is 56 bits.

   IETF use includes 66 drafts and 158 RFCs.

   Intellectual Property Rights have been claimed on DES.  The owner of
   those rights is IBM.  According to [FIPS-46-3], TDES may be "covered
   by U.S. and foreign patents, including patents issued to the
   International Business Machines Corporation.  However, IBM has
   granted nonexclusive, royalty-free licenses under the patents to
   make, use and sell apparatus which complies with the standard."

   DES is currently obsolete; its key size is inadequate to protect
   against attackers with access to modern computing resources.  The
   security implications of using DES are discussed at length in
   [RFC4772].  Historically, DES was intstrumental in the development of
   moden cryptography; Differential [C:BihSha90] and Linear [EC:
   Matsui93] Cryptanalysis were developed through the analysis of the
   DES algorithm.

   DES was designed by an IBM research team led by Horst Feistel, a
   German-born cryptographer.  DES was a refinement of the earlier
   LUCIFER cipher, which is the first modern block cipher that has been
   publicly described.


6.  Stream Ciphers

6.1.  Kcipher-2

   Kcipher-2 was first published in 2011.  It is specified in
   [I-D.kiyomoto-kcipher2] and supports a key length of 128 bits, and a

   IETF use includes 2 drafts, which specify the cipher and describe its
   use in TLS.

   Intellectual Property Rights have been claimed on Kcipher-2.  The
   owners of those rights are KDDI and Qualcomm.

   KCipher-2 has been used for industrial applications, especially for
   mobile health monitoring and diagnostic services in Japan.

6.2.  Rabbit

   Rabbit was first published in 2003 [FSE:BVPCS03] in a peer-reviewed
   workshop.  It is specified in [RFC4503], and supports a keys length
   of 128 bits, and a 64-bit IV.

   The only citation in IETF documents is the cipher specification
   itself.

   Intellectual Property Rights have been claimed on this cipher.  The
   owner of those rights is Cryptico A/S.

   The best known attacks against this cipher have a complexity greather
   than 2^128, and thus do not violate its security goals.
   Distinguishing attacks were shown in [ISC:LuDes10] [ISC:LuWanLin08].
   Side channels and fault injection attacks were considered in
   [INDOCRYPT:BerCanGou09] and [SAC:KirYou09], which described state-
   recovery attacks with 2^38 complexity.

   Rabbit is the only finalist from eSTREAM, the ECRYPT Stream Cipher
   Project, that appears in this note.  Rabbit has a relatively small
   internal state of about 64 bytes, and it updates all words of state
   at each iteration, in contrast to RC4 (Section 6.3).

6.3.  RC4

   RC4 was first described in 1994.  No normative specification exists;
   it is sometimes called ARCFOUR, which is short for alleged RC4.  The
   cipher supports key lengths of 8, 16, 24, ..., 1024 bits.  RC4 does
   not accept an initialization vector.

   IETF use includes 54 RFCs and 23 drafts, which describe the use of
   RC4 in TLS, Kerberos, and SSH.

   Intellectual Property Rights have not been claimed on RC4.
