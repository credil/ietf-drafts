Internet-Draft                  PANA PCP                       July 2012


1.  Introduction

   PCP (Port Control Protocol) [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] is used for an IPv6
   or IPv4 host to control how incoming IPv6 or IPv4 packets are
   translated and forwarded by a network address translator (NAT) or
   simple firewall, and also allows a host to optimize its outgoing NAT
   keepalive messages.

   In order to provide integrity protection for PCP messages, a message
   authentication mechanism for PCP is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-authentication].  A PCP Security Association (SA) used
   for PCP message authentication is dynamically established using EAP
   authentication where the integrity key associated the PCP SA is
   derived from EAP MSK (Master Session Key) [RFC3748].  In
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-authentication], two approaches are identified for
   establishing a PCP SA.  The first approach is separate key management
   that is based on running PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication
   for Network Access) [RFC5191] between the end-points to carry out an
   EAP authentication process needed for establising a PCP SA.  The
   second approach is inline key management that is based on running an
   EAP authentication process between two PCP devices.

   In this document, a complete solution for the first approach is
   described.

1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Establishing a PCP SA

   A PaC (PANA Client) on a PCP client node initiates PANA
   authentication prior to send an authenticated PCP message.  The
   initiation may be requested by the PCP client.  We assume that PAA
   (PANA Authentication Agent) is implemented on each PCP server that
   support authenticated PCP messages.  Therefore, the PCP server's IP
   address is used as the address of the PAA .  The PANA authentication
   for establishing a PCP SA may be conducted as part of network access
   authentication or dedicated to the PCP usage.

   Upon successful PANA authentication, the message authentication key
   for PCP message is derived from the EAP MSK as follows:

   PCP_AUTH_KEY = prf+(MSK, "IETF PCP" | SID | KID | PCP_Server_ID)

   where where | denotes concatenation.

   o  The prf+ function is defined in IKEv2 [RFC5996].  The pseudo-
      random function to be used for the prf+ function is negotiated
      using PRF-Algorithm AVP in the initial PANA-Auth-Request and PANA-
      Auth-Answer exchange with 'S' (Start) bit set.

   o  "IETF PCP" is the ASCII code representation of the non-NULL
      terminated string (excluding the double quotes around it).

   o  SID is a four-octet PANA Session Identifier [RFC5191].

   o  KID is the content of the Key-ID AVP [RFC5191] associated with the
      MSK.

   o  PCP_Server_ID is the IP address of the PCP server.  The length of
      PCP_Server_ID is 4 octets for IPv4 address and 16 octets for IPv6
      address.

   The same integrity algorithm used for the PANA session MUST be used
   for PCP message authentication.

   The PCP_AUTH_KEY and its associated parameters (i.e., the IP
   addresses of the PCP client and PCP server, Session ID, Key ID,
   message authentication algorithm and lifetime) are passed from the
   PAA application to the PCP server application on the same PCP server
   device, and also passed from the PaC application to the PCP client
   application on the same PCP client device, using an API.  The API can
   be implementation-specific, and therefore is not specified in this
   document.

   Once a PCP SA is established, any PCP message that does not contain a
   valid Authentication Tag and a fresh Nonce under the current PCP SA
   MUST be silently discarded.

   The PCP SA MUST be immediately deleted when the corresponding PANA SA
   is deleted.  The PCP SA SHALL remain as long as the corresponding
   PANA SA exists.


3.  Security Considerations

   The key provisioning mechanism described in this document provides a
   cryptographic binding between a PANA session and a PCP SA based on
   using the PCP server address, and PANA session identifier and key
   identifer in the PCP_AUTH_KEY derivation function.
