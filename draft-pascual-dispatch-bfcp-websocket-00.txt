Internet-Draft      WebSocket as a Transport for BFCP      February 2013


1.  Introduction

   The WebSocket [RFC6455] protocol enables two-way message exchange
   between clients and servers on top of a persistent TCP connection
   (optionally secured with TLS [RFC5246]).  The initial protocol
   handshake makes use of HTTP [RFC2616] semantics, allowing the
   WebSocket protocol to reuse existing HTTP infrastructure.

   The Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP) is a protocol to coordinate
   access to shared resources in a conference.  It is defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis] and is used between floor
   participants and floor control servers, and between floor chairs
   (i.e., moderators) and floor control servers.

   Modern web browsers include a WebSocket client stack complying with
   the WebSocket API [WS-API] as specified by the W3C. It is expected
   that other client applications (those running in personal computers
   and devices such as smartphones) will also make a WebSocket client
   stack available.  This document updates
   [I-D.draft-ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis] and
   [I-D.draft-ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4583bis] in order to enable the usage of
   BFCP in these scenarios.

   The transport over which BFCP entities exchange messages depends on
   how the clients obtain information to contact the floor control
   server (e.g. using an SDP offer/answer exchange per
   [I-D.draft-ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4583bis] or the procedure described in
   RFC5018).  [I-D.draft-ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis] defines two transports
   for BFCP: TCP and UDP.  This specification defines a new WebSocket
   sub-protocol (as defined in section 1.9 in [RFC6455]) for
   transporting BFCP messages between a WebSocket client and server, a
   new reliable and message boundary transport for BFCP.  In order to
   enable this, this document also defines two new SDP 'proto' values.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.1.  Definitions

   BFCP WebSocket Client:  A BFCP entity capable of opening outbound
         connections to WebSocket servers and communicating using the
         WebSocket BFCP sub-protocol as defined by this document.

Internet-Draft      WebSocket as a Transport for BFCP      February 2013


   BFCP WebSocket Server:  A BFCP entity capable of listening for
         inbound connections from WebSocket clients and communicating
         using the WebSocket BFCP sub-protocol as defined by this
         document.


3.  The WebSocket Protocol

   The WebSocket protocol [RFC6455] is a transport layer on top of TCP
   (optionally secured with TLS [RFC5246]) in which both client and
   server exchange message units in both directions.  The protocol
   defines a connection handshake, WebSocket sub-protocol and extensions
   negotiation, a frame format for sending application and control data,
   a masking mechanism, and status codes for indicating disconnection
   causes.

   The WebSocket connection handshake is based on HTTP [RFC2616] and
   utilizes the HTTP GET method with an "Upgrade" request.  This is sent
   by the client and then answered by the server (if the negotiation
   succeeded) with an HTTP 101 status code.  Once the handshake is
   completed the connection upgrades from HTTP to the WebSocket
   protocol.  This handshake procedure is designed to reuse the existing
   HTTP infrastructure.  During the connection handshake, client and
   server agree on the application protocol to use on top of the
   WebSocket transport.  Such an application protocol (also known as a
   "WebSocket sub-protocol") defines the format and semantics of the
   messages exchanged by the endpoints.  This could be a custom protocol
   or a standardized one (as the WebSocket BFCP sub-protocol defined in
   this document).  Once the HTTP 101 response is processed both client
   and server reuse the underlying TCP connection for sending WebSocket
   messages and control frames to each other.  Unlike plain HTTP, this
   connection is persistent and can be used for multiple message
   exchanges.

   The WebSocket protocol defines message units to be used by
   applications for the exchange of data, so it provides a message
   boundary-preserving transport layer.  These message units can contain
   either UTF-8 text or binary data, and can be split into multiple
   WebSocket text/binary transport frames as needed by the WebSocket
   stack.

      The WebSocket API [WS-API] for web browsers only defines callbacks
      to be invoked upon receipt of an entire message unit, regardless
      of whether it was received in a single Websocket frame or split
      across multiple frames.

4.  The WebSocket BFCP Sub-Protocol

   The term WebSocket sub-protocol refers to an application-level
   protocol layered on top of a WebSocket connection.  This document
   specifies the WebSocket BFCP sub-protocol for carrying BFCP messages
   through a WebSocket connection.

4.1.  Handshake

   The BFCP WebSocket Client and BFCP WebSocket Server negotiate usage
   of the WebSocket BFCP sub-protocol during the WebSocket handshake
   procedure as defined in section 1.3 of [RFC6455].  The Client MUST
   include the value "bfcp" in the Sec-WebSocket-Protocol header in its
   handshake request.  The 101 reply from the Server MUST contain "bfcp"
   in its corresponding Sec-WebSocket-Protocol header.

   Below is an example of a WebSocket handshake in which the Client
   requests the WebSocket BFCP sub-protocol support from the Server:

     GET / HTTP/1.1
     Host: bfcp-ws.example.com
     Upgrade: websocket
     Connection: Upgrade
     Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==
     Origin: http://www.example.com
     Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: bfcp
     Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13

   The handshake response from the Server accepting the WebSocket BFCP
   sub-protocol would look as follows:

     HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
     Upgrade: websocket
     Connection: Upgrade
     Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=
     Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: bfcp

   Once the negotiation has been completed, the WebSocket connection is
   established and can be used for the transport of BFCP messages.  The
   WebSocket messages transmitted over this connection MUST conform to
   the negotiated WebSocket sub-protocol.

4.2.  BFCP encoding

   WebSocket messages can be transported in either UTF-8 text frames or
   binary frames.  BFCP messages use a TLV (Type-Length-Value) binary
   encoding, therefore BFCP WebSocket Clients and BFCP WebSocket Servers
   MUST use binary frames to exchange BFCP messages.  In addition, the

Internet-Draft      WebSocket as a Transport for BFCP      February 2013


   encoding rules for reliable protocols defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis] MUST be followed.


5.  BFCP WebSocket Transport

   WebSocket [RFC6455] is a reliable protocol and therefore the BFCP
   WebSocket sub-protocol defined by this document is a reliable BFCP
   transport.  Thus, client and server transactions using WebSocket for
   transport MUST follow the procedures for reliable transports as
   defined in [I-D.draft-ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis] and
   [I-D.draft-ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4583bis]

   BFCP WebSocket clients cannot receive incoming WebSocket connections
   initiated by any other peer.  This means that a BFCP Websocket client
   MUST actively initiate a connection towards a BFCP Websocket server

   Each BFCP message MUST be carried within a single WebSocket message,
   and a WebSocket message MUST NOT contain more than one BFCP message.


6.  Fields in the 'm' Line

   Rules to generate an 'm' line for a BFCP stream are described in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4583bis], Section 3

   New values are defined for the transport field: TCP/WS/BFCP and TCP/
   WSS/BFCP.

      TCP/WS/BFCP is used when BFCP runs on top of WS, which in turn
      runs on top of TCP

      TCP/WSS/BFCP is used when BFCP runs on top of WS, which in turn
      runs on top of TLS and TCP

   The following are examples of 'm' lines for BFCP connections:

   m=application 50000 TCP/WS/BFCP *
   m=application 50000 TCP/WSS/BFCP *


7.  Authentication

   Section 9 of [I-D.draft-ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis] states that BFCP
   clients and floor control servers SHOULD authenticate each other
   prior to accepting messages, and RECOMMENDS that mutual TLS/DTLS
   authentication be used.  However, browser-based WebSocket clients
   have no control over the use of TLS in the WebSocket API [WS-API], so



Pascual, et al.          Expires August 19, 2013                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      WebSocket as a Transport for BFCP      February 2013


   it is RECOMMENDED that standard Web-based methods for client and
   server authentication are used, as follows.

   When a BFCP WebSocket client connects to a BFCP WebSocket server, it
   SHOULD use TCP/WSS as its transport.  The WebSocket client SHOULD
   inspect the TLS certificate offered by the server and verify that it
   is valid.

      Since the WebSocket API does not distinguish between certificate
      errors and other kinds of failure to establish a connection, it is
      expected that browser vendors will warn end users directly of any
      kind of problem with the server certificate.

   A floor control server that receives a message over TCP/WS can
   request the use of TCP/WSS by generating an Error message, as
   described in Section 13.8 of [I-D.draft-ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis],
   with an Error code with a value of 9 (use TLS).

   Prior to sending BFCP requests, a BFCP WebSocket client connects to a
   BFCP WebSocket server and performs the connection handshake.  As
   described in Section 3 the handshake procedure involves a HTTP GET
   method request from the client and a response from the server
   including an HTTP 101 status code.

   In order to authorize the WebSocket connection, the BFCP WebSocket
   server MAY inspect any cookie [RFC6265] headers present in the HTTP
   GET request.  For many web applications the value of such a cookie is
   provided by the web server once the user has authenticated themselves
   to the web server, which could be done by many existing mechanisms.
   As an alternative method, the BFCP WebSocket Server could request
   HTTP authentication by replying to the Client's GET method request
   with a HTTP 401 status code.  The WebSocket protocol [RFC6455] covers
   this usage in section 4.1:

      If the status code received from the server is not 101, the
      WebSocket client stack handles the response per HTTP [RFC2616]
      procedures, in particular the client might perform authentication
      if it receives 401 status code.


8.  Security Considerations

   Considerations from [I-D.draft-ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis],
   [I-D.draft-ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4583bis] and RFC5018 apply.

   BFCP relies on lower-layer security mechanisms to provide replay and
   integrity protection and confidentiality.  It is RECOMMENDED that the
   BFCP traffic transported over a WebSocket communication be protected

   by using a secure WebSocket connection (using TLS [RFC5246] over
   TCP).


9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  Registration of the WebSocket BFCP Sub-Protocol

   This specification requests IANA to register the WebSocket BFCP sub-
   protocol under the "WebSocket Subprotocol Name" Registry with the
   following data:

   Subprotocol Identifier:  bfcp

   Subprotocol Common Name:  WebSocket Transport for BFCP (Binary Floor
      Control Protocol)

   Subprotocol Definition:  TBD: this document

9.2.  Registration of new SDP 'proto' Values

   This document defines two new SDP 'proto' values (WS/BFCP and WSS/
   BFCP) and requests IANA to register these values under the "Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters" registry.  The resulting
   entries are as follows:

   Value                   Reference
   --------------           ---------
   TCP/WS/BFCP             [TBD: this document]
   TCP/WSS/BFCP            [TBD: this document]
