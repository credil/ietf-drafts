     Abstract 

     Network performance criteria such as latency and latency variation 
     are becoming critical to data path selection, especially for 
     networks used by financial institutions. This draft defines

     and latency variation in Path Computation Element Communication 
     Protocol (PCEP).

     1. Introduction 

       As noted in [OSPF-TE-METRIC] and [ISIS-TE-METRIC], in certain 
       networks such as financial information networks (e.g. stock 
       market data providers), performance criteria (e.g. latency, 
       latency variation) are becoming critical to data path selection 
       along with other metrics. Such networks may require selection of 
       a path that minimizes end-to-end latency and/or end-to-end 
       latency variation. Or a path may need to be found that optimizes 
       some other metric, but is subjected to a latency and/or latency 
       variation bound(s).  

       The METRIC object defined in [RFC5440] allows a PCC to specify a 
       bounded acceptable path cost and/or optimization metric. While 
       [RFC5440], [RFC5541] and [RFC6006] define various Metric Types, 
       these RFCs do not address latency and latency variation metrics. 
       This document extends [RFC 5540] with four new Metric Types 
       namely Point-to-Point (P2P) latency metric, P2P latency variation 
       metric, Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) latency metric and P2MP 
       latency variation metric.  

       [RFC5541] defines a framework to extend the PCEP to allow a PCE 
       to indicate the set of objective functions it supports. [RFC5541] 
       also define procedure so that a PCC can indicate in a path 
       computation request the required objective function, and a PCE   
       can report in a path computation reply the objective function 
       that was used for path computation. While [RFC5541] and [RFC6006] 
       define various objective functions, these documents do not define 
       objective functions for optimizing network performance criteria 
       such as latency and latency variation. This document extends the 
       [RFC5541] with two new objective functions namely Minimum Latency 
       Path (MLP) OF and Minimum Latency Variation Path (MLVP) OF. 

     2. PCEP extensions 

        This section defines PCEP extensions for requirements outlined 
        in Section 1.  

     2.1. New Metric Object Types  

           This document defines the following four additional types for 
        the <METRIC> object defined in [RFC5440}. For explanation of

        these metrics, the following terminology is used and expanded 
        along the way.  

          - A network comprises of a set of N links {Li, (i=1...N)}. 

          - A path P of a P2P LSP is a list of K links {Lpi,(i=1...K)}. 

     2.1.1. P2P Latency Metric 

        Link delay metric is defined in [OSPF-TE-METRIC] and [ISIS-TE-
        METRIC]. P2P latency metric type of <METRIC> object in PCEP 
        encodes the sum of the link delay metric of all links along a 
        P2P Path. Specifically, extending on the above mentioned 
        terminology:  

          -  Link delay metric of link L is denoted D(L). 

          -  P2P latency metric for the Path P = Sum {D(Lpi), 
            (i=1...K)}. 

        Value for P2P latency metric type is to be assigned by IANA 
        (suggested value: 11).  

     2.1.2. P2P Latency Variation Metric 

        Link delay variation metric is defined in [OSPF-TE-METRIC] and 
        [ISIS-TE-METRIC]. P2P latency variation metric type of <METRIC> 
        object in PCEP encodes a function of the link delay variation 
        metric of all links along a P2P Path. Specifically, extending on 
        the above mentioned terminology:  

          -  Latency variation of link L is denoted DV(L). 

          -  P2P latency variation metric for the Path P = Function 
            {DV(Lpi), (i=1...K)}. 

        Specification of the "Function" used to drive latency variation 
        metric of a path from latency variation metrics of individual 
        links along the path is beyond the scope of this document.  

        Value for P2P latency variation metric is to be assigned by IANA 
        (suggested value: 12).  

     2.1.3. P2MP Latency Metric 

       P2MP latency metric type of <METRIC> object in PCEP encodes the 
       path latency metric for destination that observes the worst

       latency metric among all destination of the P2MP tree. 
       Specifically, extending on the above mentioned terminology: 

         - A P2MP Tree T comprises of a set of M destinations {Dest_j, 
           (j=1...M)} 

         - P2P latency metric of the Path to destination Dest_j is 
           denoted by LM(Dest_j). 

         - P2MP latency metric for the P2MP tree T = Maximum 
           {LM(Dest_j), (j=1...M)}.   

       Value for P2MP latency metric is to be assigned by IANA 
       (suggested value: 13).  

     2.1.4. P2MP Latency Variation Metric 

       P2MP latency variation metric type of <METRIC> object in PCEP 
       encodes the path latency variation metric for destination that 
       observes the worst latency variation metric among all destination 
       of the P2MP tree. Specifically, extending on the above mentioned 
       terminology: 

         - A P2MP Tree T comprises of a set of M destinations {Dest_j, 
           (j=1...M)} 

         - P2P latency variation metric of the Path to destination 
           Dest_j is denoted by LVM(Dest_j). 

         - P2MP latency variation metric for the P2MP tree T = Maximum 
           {LVM(Dest_j), (j=1...M)}.   

       Value for P2MP latency variation metric is to be assigned by IANA 
       (suggested value: 14).  

     2.2. Handling of New Metric Object Types  

        This document does not propose any changes to handling of Metric 
        object. Specifically, the new metric types defined in this 
        document are handled in the same fashion as metric types defined 
        in [RFC5440].  

     2.3. New Objective Functions 

        This document extends the [RFC 5541] with two new objective 
        functions namely Minimum Latency Path (MLP) OF and Minimum 
        Latency Variation Path (MLVP) OF. The objective function code 
        for each of the new objective function is also defined.

     2.3.1. Minimum Latency Path Objective Function 

        Minimum Latency Path (MLP) OF is defined as an objective 
        function where a path is computed such that latency of the path 
        is minimized.  

        Objective function code for MLP OF is to be assigned by IANA 
        (suggested value: 9).  

     2.3.2. Minimum Latency Variation Path Objective Function 

         Minimum Latency Variation Path (MLVP) OF is defined as an 
        objective function where a path is computed such that latency 
        variation in the path is minimized.  

        Objective function code for MLVP OF is to be assigned by IANA 
        (suggested value: 10).  

     2.4. Handling of New Objective Functions 

        This document does not propose any changes to handling of <OF> 
        object. Specifically, the new OF types defined in this document 
        are handled in the same fashion as OF types defined in 
        [RFC5541].  

     3. Security Considerations 

        This document does not introduce any additional security issues 
        beyond those identified in [RFC5440], [RFC5541] and [RFC6006]. 

     4. IANA Considerations 

        This document defines the following four additional types for 
        the <METRIC> object defined in [RFC5440].  

        Value                         Description 

        -----                         ------------ 

        TBA (suggest value: 11)       P2P latency metric 

        TBA (suggest value: 12)       P2P latency variation metric 

        TBA (suggest value: 13)       P2MP latency metric 

        TBA (suggest value: 14)       P2MP latency variation metric
