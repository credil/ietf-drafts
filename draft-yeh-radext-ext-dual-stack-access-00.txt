Internet-Draft              RADIUS Dual Stack                  July 2012


1.  Introduction

   Subscriber IP sessions can be either IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack, IPv6-only,
   or the legacy IPv4-only in the typical PPPoE based [BBF TR-187] or
   IPoE based [BBF TR-177] deployment scenarios.  The user in these IP
   sessions can be a host or a Customer Edge router (CE router, routed
   Residential Gateway, routed-RG, Customer Premise Equipment or routed-
   CPE).  In the IPv6 part of these session, the broadband Network
   Access Server (NAS) acting as the Provider Edge router (PE router)
   and RADIUS client simultaneously, usually employ DHCPv6-PD
   [RFC3633][RFC4818] to delegate IPv6 prefix to CE router for its
   customer network.  In the meantime, the WAN (NAS-facing) interface of
   CE router can be numbered or unnumbered (Section 2.3 of [BBF
   TR-177]).  The NAS can employ SLAAC [RFC4862] to assign a IPv6 prefix
   or employ DHCPv6 [RFC3315] to assign a IPv6 address to the CE router
   for its WAN interface.  Therefore, there are at least the following
   access types of user that the NAS and the centralized AAA server are
   served for:

      PPPoE-IPv4-only-host or CE

      PPPoE-IPv6-only-host (Numbered by SLAAC)
      PPPoE-IPv6-only-host (Numbered by DHCPv6)
      PPPoE-IPv6-only-CE (Unnumbered)
      PPPoE-IPv6-only-CE (Numbered by SLAAC)
      PPPoE-IPv6-only-CE (Numbered by DHCPv6)

      PPPoE-dual-stack-host (IPv6-Numbered by SLAAC)
      PPPoE-dual-stack-host (IPv6-Numbered by DHCPv6)
      PPPoE-dual-stack-CE (IPv6-Unnumbered)
      PPPoE-dual-stack-CE (IPv6-Numbered by SLAAC)
      PPPoE-dual-stack-CE (IPv6-Numbered by DHCPv6)

      IPoE-IPv4-only-host or CE

      IPoE-IPv6-only-host (Numbered by SLAAC)
      IPoE-IPv6-only-host (Numbered by DHCPv6)
      IPoE-IPv6-only-CE (Unnumbered)
      IPoE-IPv6-only-CE (Numbered by SLAAC)
      IPoE-IPv6-only-CE (Numbered by DHCPv6)

      IPoE-dual-stack-host (IPv6-Numbered by SLAAC)
      IPoE-dual-stack-host (IPv6-Numbered by DHCPv6)
      IPoE-dual-stack-CE (IPv6-Unnumbered)
      IPoE-dual-stack-CE (IPv6-Numbered by SLAAC)
      IPoE-dual-stack-CE (IPv6-Numbered by DHCPv6)

   The different access type of users need the NAS (Broadband Network

   Gateway or BNG) employ different mechanism and allocate different
   resource for the associated processes.  The addresses assigned and
   the prefixes delegated to the customer hosts or CE can be explicitly
   got from the AAA server through attributes in the Access-Accept
   packets ([RFC2865], [RFC3162] and [RFC4818]), or be dynamically get
   from the local address or prefix pool configured on the NAS
   ([RFC2869], [RFC3162] and [ietf-radext-ipv6-access-09]).  When the
   NAS dynamically assign address or delegate prefix to the customer
   hosts or CE from the pools, it can use the default or preconfigured
   pools on the NAS or alternatively use the indicated pools in the
   attributes of the Access-Accept.

   This document defines the additional RADIUS attributes to specify the
   access type of users for the simplified and proper authorization and
   accounting in RADIUS processes.


2.  Terminology and Conventions

   This document describes the additional RADIUS attribute and the
   associated usage on NAS and AAA server.  This document should be read
   in conjunction with the relevant RADIUS specifications, including
   [RFC2865], [RFC2866], [RFC2869], [RFC3162] and [RFC4818] for a
   complete mechanism.  Definitions for terms and acronyms not
   specifically defined in this document are defined in RFC2865,
   RFC2866, RFC2869, RFC3162 and RFC4818.

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

   In the above depicted scenario, the NAS acting as PE router may
   configure local address or prefix pools, use the mechanism of PPPoE
   NCP, IPv6 SLAAC or DHCPv6 protocols to handle IPv4 address, IPv6
   address and IPv6 prefix assignment to hosts or CEs.  The AAA server

   authenticates each host or CE, and returns the attributes used for
   authorization and accounting.

   The attribute of Access-Type can be used to indicate the right
   configuration on the NAS for the users, or to report the right access
   type of the users to the accounting server.  When the attribute of
   Access-Type is included, the address and prefix pools of the default
   configuration on the NAS are not always necessary to be indicated in
   the Access-Accept packet for the users' authorization.


4.  Attributes

   The fields shown in the diagrams below are transmitted from left to
   right.

4.1.  Access-Type

   Description

      The attribute indicates the access type of the user requested in
      the Access-Request packet, authorized in the Access-Accept packet
      or recorded in the Accounting-Request packet.

      The format of the Access-Type is:

      When IPoE is used for the access method, the Access-Type of user
      gets the following 'Value':

      22  IPoE-dual-stack-CE (IPv6-Numbered by DHCPv6)

   o  For the user access type of IPv4-only host (or CE), NAS needs to
      report Access-Type and Framed-IP-Address (8) in the accounting-
      request packets for the assigned IPv4 address;

   o  For the user access type of IPv6-only host (Numbered by SLAAC),
      NAS needs to report Access-Type and Framed-IPv6-Prefix (97) in the
      accounting-request packets;

   o  For the user access type of IPv6-only CE (Numbered by SLAAC), NAS
      needs to report Access-Type, Framed-IPv6-Prefix (97) and
      Delegated-IPv6-Prefix (123) in the accounting-request packets;

   o  For the user access type of IPv6-only CE (Numbered by DHCPv6), NAS
      needs to report Access-Type, Framed-IPv6-address and Delegated-
      IPv6-Prefix (123) in the accounting-request packets;

   o  For the user access type of dual-stack host (IPv6-Numbered by
      SLAAC), NAS needs to report Access-Type, Framed-IP-Address (8) and
      Framed-IPv6-Prefix (97) in the accounting-request packets;

   o  For the user access type of dual-stack host (IPv6-Numbered by
      DHCPv6), NAS needs to report Access-Type, Framed-IP-Address (8)
      and Framed-IPv6-address in the accounting-request packets;

   o  For the user access type of dual-stack CE (IPv6-Unnumbered), NAS
      needs to report Access-Type, Framed-IP-Address (8) and Delegated-
      IPv6-Prefix (123) in the accounting-request packets;

   o  For the user access type of dual-Stack CE (IPv6-Numbered by

      Framed-IPv6-address and Delegated-IPv6-Prefix (123) in the
      accounting-request packets.

   Discussion:

      The alternative attribute design could separate the access type of
      the users into several dimensions.


      Access-Method: Enumerated Data Type
         0 for PPPoE; 1 for IPoE
      Stack-Type: Enumerated Data Type
         0 for dual stack; 1 for IPv4-only; 2 for IPv6-only
      Node-Type: Enumerated Data Type
         0 for host; 1 for CE
      WAN-Interface-Numbering-Type: Enumerated Data Type
         0 for Unnumbered; 1 for numbered
      WAN-Interface-Address-Assignment-Type: Enumerated Data Type
         0 for SLAAC; 1 for DHCPv6

      Though the combination of the attributes sounds clearer in the
      semantics, and not all of attributes defined are needed for every
      user, but it still looks too complicated in some use cases.


5.  Table of Attributes

   The following table provides a guide to which attributes may be found
   in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.

   Req-  Acc-  Rej-  Chall  Accounting #      Attribute
   uest  ept   ect   -enge  Request
   0-1   0-1   0     0      0-1        TBA1   Access-Type

   The meaning of the above table entries is as follows:

   0    This attribute MUST NOT be present.
   0+   Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be present.
   0-1  Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be present.
   1    Exactly one instance of this attribute MUST be present.
   1+   One or more of these attributes MUST be present.


6.  Security Considerations

   Security issues related RADIUS are described in section 8 of RFC2865
   and section 5 of RFC3162.


7.  IANA Considerations

   The authors of this document request to assign new Radius type code
   for Access-Type.  IANA should allocate the new code from the standard
   RADIUS Attributes space using the "IETF Review" policy [RFC5226].
