                         A SIP Usage for RELOAD
                        draft-ietf-p2psip-sip-07

Abstract

   This document defines a SIP Usage for REsource LOcation And Discovery
   (RELOAD), The SIP Usage provides the functionality of a SIP proxy or
   registrar in a fully-distributed system.  The SIP Usage provides
   lookup service for AoRs stored in the overlay.  The SIP Usage also
   defines GRUUs that allow the registrations to map an AoR to a
   specific node reachable through the overlay.  The AppAttach method is
   used to establish a direct connection between nodes through which SIP
   messages are exchanged.

Internet-Draft              RELOAD SIP Usage                January 2012


1.  Overview

   The SIP Usage of RELOAD allows SIP user agents to provide a peer-to-
   peer telephony service without the requirement for permanent proxy or
   registration servers.  In such a network, the RELOAD overlay itself
   performs the registration and rendezvous functions ordinarily
   associated with such servers.

   The SIP Usage involves two basic functions:
   Registration:    SIP UAs can use the RELOAD data storage
      functionality to store a mapping from their AOR to their Node-ID
      in the overlay, and to retrieve the Node-ID of other UAs.
   Rendezvous:    Once a SIP UA has identified the Node-ID for an AOR it
      wishes to call, it can use the RELOAD message routing system to
      set up a direct connection which can be used to exchange SIP
      messages.

   For instance, Bob could register his Node-ID, "1234", under his AOR,
   "bob@dht.example.com".  When Alice wants to call Bob, she queries the
   overlay for "bob@dht.example.com" and gets back Node-ID 1234.  She
   then uses the overlay to establish a direct connection with Bob and
   can use that direct connection to perform a standard SIP INVITE.  The
   way this works is as follows:

   1.  Bob, operating Node-ID 1234, stores a mapping from his URI to his
       Node-ID in the overlay.  I.e., "bob@dht.example.com -> 1234".
   2.  Alice, operating Node-ID 5678, decides to call Bob. She looks up
       "bob@dht.example.com" in the overlay and retrieves "1234".
   3.  Alice uses the overlay to route an AppAttach message to Bob's
       peer.  Bob responds with his own AppAttach and they set up a
       direct connection, as shown below.

   INVITE ----------------------------------------->
   <--------------------------------------------- OK
   ACK -------------------------------------------->
   <------------ ICE Checks for media ------------->
   <-------------------- RTP ---------------------->


   It is important to note that RELOAD's only role here is to set up the
   direct SIP connection between Alice and Bob. As soon as the ICE
   checks complete and the connection is established, then ordinary SIP
   is used.  In particular, the establishment of the media channel for
   the phone call happens via the usual SIP mechanisms, and RELOAD is
   not involved.  Media never goes over the overlay.  After the
   successful exchange of SIP messages, call peers run ICE connectivity
   checks for media.

   As well as allowing mappings from AORs to Node-IDs, the SIP Usage
   also allows mappings from AORs to other AORs.  For instance, if Bob
   wanted his phone calls temporarily forwarded to Charlie, he could
   store the mapping "bob@dht.example.com -> charlie@dht.example.com".
   When Alice wants to call Bob, she retrieves this mapping and can then
   fetch Charlie's AOR to retrieve his Node-ID.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   We use the terminology and definitions from Concepts and Terminology
   for Peer to Peer SIP [I-D.ietf-p2psip-concepts] and the RELOAD Base
   Protocol [I-D.ietf-p2psip-base] extensively in this document.

   The term AOR is the SIP "Address of Record" used to inditify a user



Jennings, et al.          Expires July 20, 2012                 [Page 5]

   in SIP.  For example, alice@example.com could be the AOR for Alice.
   For the purposes of this specification, an AOR is consiered not to
   include the scheme (e.g sip:) as the AOR needs to match the
   rfc822Name in the X509v3 certificates.


3.  Registering AORs

   In ordinary SIP, a UA registers its AOR and location with a
   registrar.  In RELOAD, this registrar function is provided by the
   overlay as a whole.  To register its location, a RELOAD peer stores a
   SipRegistration structure under its own AOR.  This uses the SIP-
   REGISTRATION Kind-ID, which is formally defined in Section 7.
   Note:  GRUUs are handled via a separate mechanism, as described in
      Section 6.

   As a simple example, if Alice's AOR were "alice@dht.example.com" and
   her Node-ID were "1234", she might store the mapping
   "alice@example.org -> 1234".  This would tell anyone who wanted to
   call Alice to contact node "1234".

   RELOAD peers MAY store two kinds of SIP mappings:

   o  From AORs to destination lists (a single Node-ID is just a trivial
      destination list.)
   o  From AORs to other AORs.

   The meaning of the first kind of mapping is "in order to contact me,
   form a connection with this peer."  The meaning of the second kind of
   mapping is "in order to contact me, dereference this AOR".  This
   allows for forwarding.  For instance, if Alice wants calls to her to
   be forwarded to her secretary, Sam, she might insert the following
   mapping "alice@dht.example.org -> sam@dht.example.org".

   The contents of a SipRegistration structure are as follows:

          enum {sip_registration_uri (1), sip_registration_route (2),
             (255)} SipRegistrationType;

          select (SipRegistration.type) {
            case sip_registration_uri:
              opaque               uri<0..2^16-1>;

            case sip_registration_route:
              opaque               contact_prefs<0..2^16-1>;
              Destination          destination_list<0..2^16-1>;

            /* This type can be extended */

          } SipRegistrationData;

          struct {
             SipRegistrationType   type;
             uint16                length;
             SipRegistrationData   data;
         } SipRegistration;



   The contents of the SipRegistration PDU are:


   type
      the type of the registration

   length
      the length of the rest of the PDU

   data
      the registration data

   o  If the registration is of type "sip_registration_uri", then the
      contents are an opaque string containing the URI.
   o  If the registration is of type "sip_registration_route", then the
      contents are an opaque string containing the callee's contact
      preferences and a destination list for the peer.

   RELOAD explicitly supports multiple registrations for a single AOR.
   The registrations are stored in a Dictionary with the dictionary keys
   being Node-IDs.  Consider, for instance, the case where Alice has two
   peers:






Jennings, et al.          Expires July 20, 2012                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              RELOAD SIP Usage                January 2012


   o  her desk phone (1234)
   o  her cell phone (5678)

   Alice might store the following in the overlay at resource
   "alice@dht.example.com".

   o  A SipRegistration of type "sip_registration_route" with dictionary
      key "1234" and value "1234".
   o  A SipRegistration of type "sip_registration_route" with dictionary
      key "5678" and value "5678".

   Note that this structure explicitly allows one Node-ID to forward to
   another Node-ID.  For instance, Alice could set calls to her desk
   phone to ring at her cell phone.  It's not clear that this is useful
   in this case, but may be useful if Alice has two AORs.

   In order to prevent hijacking, registrations are subject to access
   control rules.  Before a Store is permitted, the storing peer MUST
   check that:

   o  The certificate contains a username that is a SIP AOR that hashes
      to the Resource-ID it is being stored at.
   o  The certificate contains a Node-ID that is the same as the
      dictionary key it is being stored at.

   Note that these rules permit Alice to forward calls to Bob without
   his permission.  However, they do not permit Alice to forward Bob's
   calls to her.  See Section 8.2.2 for more on this point.


4.  Looking up an AOR

   When a RELOAD user wishes to call another user, starting with a non-
   GRUU AOR, he follows the following procedure.  (GRUUs are discussed
   in Section 6).

   1.  Check to see if the domain part of the AOR matches the domain
       name of an overlay of which he is a member.  If not, then this is
       an external AOR, and he MUST do one of the following:
       *  Fail the call.
       *  Use ordinary SIP procedures.
       *  Attempt to become a member of the overlay indicated by the
          domain part, if that overlay is a RELOAD overlay.)
   2.  Perform a Fetch for kind SIP-REGISTRATION at the Resource-ID
       corresponding to the AOR.  This Fetch SHOULD NOT indicate any
       dictionary keys, so that it will fetch all the stored values.





Jennings, et al.          Expires July 20, 2012                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft              RELOAD SIP Usage                January 2012


   3.  If any of the results of the Fetch are non-GRUU AORs, then repeat
       step 1 for that AOR.
   4.  Once only GRUUs and destination lists remain, the peer removes
       duplicate destination lists and GRUUs from the list and forms a
       SIP connection to the appropriate peers as described in the
       following sections.  If there are also external AORs, the peer
       follows the appropriate procedure for contacting them as well.

   Open Issue:  Does the RHS of the AORs stored ina given overlay have
   to match the overlay name?


5.  Forming a Direct Connection

   Once the peer has translated the AOR into a set of destination lists,
   it then uses the overlay to route AppAttach messages to each of those
   peers.  The "application" field MUST be 5060 to indicate SIP.  If
   certificate-based authentication is in use, the responding peer MUST
   present a certificate with a Node-ID matching the terminal entry in
   the route list.  Note that it is possible that the peers already have
   a RELOAD connection between them.  This MUST NOT be used for SIP
   messages.  However, if a SIP connection already exists, that MAY be
   used.  Once the AppAttach succeeds, the peer sends SIP messages over
   the connection as in normal SIP.


6.  GRUUs

   GRUUs do not require storing data in the Overlay Instance.  Rather,
   they are constructed by embedding a base64-encoded destination list
   in the gr URI parameter of the GRUU.  The base64 encoding is done
   with the alphabet specified in table 1 of RFC 4648 with the exception
   that ~ is used in place of =.  An example GRUU is
   "alice@example.com;gr=MDEyMzQ1Njc4OTAxMjM0NTY3ODk~".  When a peer
   needs to route a message to a GRUU in the same P2P network, it simply
   uses the destination list and connects to that peer.

   Because a GRUU contains a destination list, it MAY have the same
   contents as a destination list stored elsewhere in the resource
   dictionary.

   Anonymous GRUUs are done in roughly the same way but require either
   that the enrollment server issue a different Node-ID for each
   anonymous GRUU required or that a destination list be used that
   includes a peer that compresses the destination list to stop the
   Node-ID from being revealed.

7.  SIP-REGISTRATION Kind Definition

   This section defines the SIP-REGISTRATION kind.


   Name  SIP-REGISTRATION

   Kind IDs  The Resource Name for the SIP-REGISTRATION Kind-ID is the
      AOR of the user.  The data stored is a SipRegistration, which can
      contain either another URI or a destination list to the peer which
      is acting for the user.

   Data Model  The data model for the SIP-REGISTRATION Kind-ID is
      dictionary.  The dictionary key is the Node-ID of the storing
      peer.  This allows each peer (presumably corresponding to a single
      device) to store a single route mapping.

   Access Control  USER-NODE-MATCH.  Note that this matches the SIP AOR
      against the rfc822Name in the X509v3 certificate.  The rfc822Name
      does not include the scheme so that "sip:" prefix needs to be
      removed from the SIP AOR before matching.

   Data stored under the SIP-REGISTRATION kind is of type
   SipRegistration.  This comes in two varieties:

   sip_registration_uri
      a URI which the user can be reached at.

   sip_registration_route
      a destination list which can be used to reach the user's peer.


8.  Security Considerations

8.1.  Overview

   RELOAD provides a generic storage service, albeit one designed to be
   useful for P2PSIP.  In this section we discuss security issues that
   are likely to be relevant to any usage of RELOAD.  In Section 8.2 we
   describe issues that are specific to SIP.

8.2.  SIP-Specific Issues

8.2.1.  Fork Explosion

   Because SIP includes a forking capability (the ability to retarget to
   multiple recipients), fork bombs are a potential DoS concern.
   However, in the SIP usage of RELOAD, fork bombs are a much lower



Jennings, et al.          Expires July 20, 2012                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft              RELOAD SIP Usage                January 2012


   concern because the calling party is involved in each retargeting
   event and can therefore directly measure the number of forks and
   throttle at some reasonable number.

8.2.2.  Malicious Retargeting

   Another potential DoS attack is for the owner of an attractive number
   to retarget all calls to some victim.  This attack is difficult to
   ameliorate without requiring the target of a SIP registration to
   authorize all stores.  The overhead of that requirement would be
   excessive and in addition there are good use cases for retargeting to
   a peer without there explicit cooperation.

8.2.3.  Privacy Issues

   All RELOAD SIP registration data is public.  Methods of providing
   location and identity privacy are still being studied.


9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA [shall register/has registered] code point TBD to represent the
   SIP-REGISTRATION kind, as described in Section 7.
