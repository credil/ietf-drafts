1.  Introduction

   RFC 6311 [RFC6311] defines an extension to the IKEv2 protocol to
   solve the main issues of "IPsec Cluster Problem Statement" in the
   commonly deployed hot standby cluster, and provides implementation
   advice for other issues.  The main issues solved are the
   synchronization of IKEv2 Message ID counters, and of IPsec replay
   counters.  This document analyzes RFC 6311, and proposes some
   updates.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Security Analysis of RFC 6311

   Note: this section is just for informative purpose, and should be
   removed or moved to Appendix in the subsequent versions.

2.1.  Observation 1: State Data of the New Active Member Being Stale and
      Unreliable

   Since normally synchronization is carried out periodically between
   the active cluster member and standby members, the state data of the
   new active member is stale.  The state data of the new active member
   just reflects the state data of the old active member at the last
   state synchronization time point T1 before the failover events
   occurs, rather than at the time point T2 when the failover event
   happens.  So the state data of the new active member can NOT reflect
   the actual state data of the old active member at T2.  This implies
   that the state data of the new active member is NOT reliable.
   Specifically, the new active member does NOT know what messages the
   old active member has sent and received from T1 and T2, and does NOT
   know the next sender's Message ID value of the old active member, and
   does NOT know the last Message ID value recevied from the peer of the
   old active member, and does NOT know whether requested messages from
   T1 to T2 by the old active member have been acknowledged, and does
   NOT know whether the old active member has acknowledged requested
   messages from T1 to T2 from the peer.  Further, this implies that the
   new active member does NOT know whether some new IPsec SAs have been
   created, and whether some old IPsec SAs have been deleted and some
   old IPsec SAs have been updated, and whether the old IKE SA has been
   deleted and a new IKE SA has been created from T1 to T2.

2.2.  Observation 2: A Parameter Flaw in Section 5.1: Processing Rules
      for IKE Message ID Synchronization

   In RFC 6311 [RFC6311], M1, P1, M2 and P2 are set as follows.

   1.  M1 is the next sender's Message ID to be used by the member.  M1
       MUST be chosen so that it is larger than any value known to have
       been used.  It is RECOMMENDED to increment the known value at
       least by the size of the IKE sender window.

   2.  P1 SHOULD be 1 more than the last Message ID value received from
       the peer, but may be any higher value.

   3.  M2 MUST be at least the higher of the received M1, and one more
       than the highest sender value received from the cluster.  This
       includes any previous received synchronization messages.

   4.  P2 MUST be the higher of the received P1 value, and one more than
       the highest sender value used by the peer.

   The setting of M2 is wrong, the reason is as follows.  In the
   following disccussion, suppose the peer is a IPsec client or VPN
   gateway, not a IPsec cluster.  First, based on observation 1, M1
   chosen by the new active member is NOT accurate or reliable.  Under
   some circumstances, M1 may be much lower than the highest sender
   value received from the cluster, if a lot of IKEv2 messages are
   exchanged from T1 to T2.  Second, one more than the highest sender
   value received from the cluster just covers the received messages,
   does NOT cover the sent but unreached messages from the old active
   member.  Suppose the highest sender value received from the cluster
   is RN0, and the sender window of the cluster is SW.  Then the old
   active member may have sent SW messages with message ID RNO+1, ...
   RNO+SW messages, and these SW messages may have NOT reached the peer.
   If M2 is set as RN0+1, then the Message ID of the new active number
   will start from RNO+1.  Since RNO+1 is lower than RNO+SW, this will
   cause some problems.

   1.  Case A: since RNO+1 is lower than RNO+SW, the Message ID of the
       first sent message from the new active member is lower than the
       Messsage ID of the last message sent by the old active member.
       This means that the message ID are NOT monotonically incremental.

   2.  Case B: the message IDs RNO+1,RNO+2,..., RNO+SW will be used
       twice in the two groups of messages sent by the old active member
       and new active member.  This means that the peer may receive two
       different request messages with the same Message ID.

   3.  Case C: the new active member may receive an acceptable but
       mismatched response message for a request message with message ID
       within RNO+1,RNO+2,..., RNO+SW.  For example, the peer may
       generate a response message to a request from the old active
       member with a Message ID RNO+2, and the new active member may
       receive this message as the response for its request message with
       the same Message ID.  Under some circumstances, this may cause
       some security risks.

   When the peer can act as a reliable archor point, the flaw can be
   fixed.

2.3.  Observation 3: Mishandling of Simultaneous Failover

   When simultaneous failover happens, the state data of new active
   members of the two clusters are NOT reliable, and can NOT act as
   reliable archor points to perform the IKEv2 message ID
   synchronization.  Suppose there exists two clusters: X and Y. And the
   old and new active member of X is x1 and x2, respectively.  The old
   and new active member of Y is y1 and y2, respectively.  And suppose
   x2 initiates the synchronization process.  First, based on
   observation 1, M1 chosen by x2 is NOT accurate or reliable.
   Additionally, because y2's state data is stale, y2's highest sender
   value received from the cluster X is not exactly identical to that of
   y1's.  Under some circumstances, y2's highest sender value received
   from the cluster X may be much lower than y1's, if a lot of IKEv2
   messages are exchanged between X1 and Y1 from T1 to T2.  As a
   consequence, M2 chosen by y2 may be NOT reliable.  Second, based on
   the same reason, P1 chosen by x2 is NOT accurate or reliable.  The
   reason is that x2's last Message ID value received from cluster Y may
   be much lower than x1's.  Similarily, the highest sender value used
   by y2 may be much lower than the highest sender value used by y1.  As
   a consequence, P2 chosen by y2 may be NOT reliable, and may be even
   lower than some message IDs used by y1.  Overall, the mishanling of
   simultaneous failover may cause some problems.

   1.  Case A: the Message ID of the first sent message from x2 are
       lower than the Messsage ID of the last message sent by x1.  This
       means that the message ID are NOT monotonically incremental.

   2.  Case B: Some message IDs will be used twice in the two groups of
       messages sent by x1 and x2.  This means that Y2 may receive two
       different request messages with the same Message ID.

   3.  Case C: x2 may receive an acceptable but mismatched response
       message for a request message.

   4.  Case D: x2 may accept a request message sent by y1.  When y2's P2
       is lower than the message IDs used by y1, the request message of
       y1 with a Message ID greater than P2 will be accepted by x2.
       This indicates that a request message from y1 may be accepted
       twice, one by x1, and one by x2.

   5.  Case E: y2 may accept a response message sent by x1.  When y2's
       P2 is lower than the message IDs used by y1, the response message
       of x1 with a Message ID greater than P2 may be accepted by y2.
       Under some circumstances, this may cause some security risks.

   6.  Case F: from T1 to T2, x1 and y1 may have deleted the old IKE SA,
       and created a new IKE SA.  However, since x2 and y2 have NOT
       updated their state data, after the simulateous failover event
       occurs, x2 and y2 may still use the old IKE SA.  This may cause
       some security risks

   Unlike observation 2, in the case of simulatenous failover, the flaw
   can NOT be easily fixed.


3.  Update to RFC 6311, Avoiding Simultaneous Failover

   When a failover event occurs, the synchronization state of the new
   active member should be set to UNSYNED.  Meanwhile, the new active
   member should generate a synchronization request message and send it
   to the peer.  When a cluster member in UNSYNED state receives a
   synchronization request, it should reply a Simultaneous Failover
   Failure response message to the peer to avoid the simultaneous
   failover failure, and terminates the synchronization process.
   Correspondingly, when the new active member of the peer cluster in
   UNSYNED state receives the Simultaneous Failover Failure message, it
   will terminate the synchronization process as well.

   Note: the details of message type and protocol will be done in the
   subsequent versions.  A new parameter called synchronization state is
   integrated into the IKE SA state data.  After the failover event
   occurs, the synchronization state is set to UNSYNED.  And after the
   synchronization process is finished, the synchronization state is set
   to SYNED.  A simple state machine is introduced.The synchronization
   state of a IPsec VPN and IPsec gateway is always SYNED.  The initial
   state of a new active member is UNSYNED.  After the success of
   synchronization, the synchronization of the new active member will be
   changed to SYNED.  An IPsec party in SYNED state is capable of
   performing synchronization for the opposite party in UNSYNED state.

4.  Update to RFC 6311, Section 5.1: Processing Rules for IKE Message ID
    Synchronization

   1.  Parameter modification: M2 MUST be at least the higher of the
       received M1 and M1', where M1' is the peer cluster's sender
       window size plus the highest sender value received from the peer
       cluster.  This includes any previous received synchronization
       messages.  This modification ensures that M2 is larger than the
       largest Message ID sent by the old active member.


5.  Security Considerations

   Security implications will be discussed in the subsequent versions.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces a new IKEv2 Notification Message type:
   Simultaneous Failover Failure.  This new type needs to be assigned a
   value.
