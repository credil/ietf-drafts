This document describes the applicability of Multiprotocol Label
Switching (MPLS) to traffic engineering in IP networks.  Special
considerations for deployment of MPLS for traffic engineering in
operational contexts are discussed and the limitations of the MPLS
approach to traffic engineering are highlighted.
