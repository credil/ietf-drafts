This document describes the problem space and solution requirements
for developing an IP Security Policy (IPSP) configuration and
management framework.  The IPSP architecture provides a scalable,
decentralized framework for managing, discovering and negotiating the
host and network security policies that govern access, authorization,
authentication, confidentiality, data integrity, and other IP Security
properties.  This document highlights such architectural components
and presents their functional requirements.

This document is a product of the IP Security Policy Working Group of
the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
