                     SFF Extensions for Mobile IPv6
                     draft-perkins-mext-sffexts-01

Abstract

   A mobile node with multiple radio interfaces running in single-radio
   mode will typically need IP address continuity as it migrates from
   one 4G wireless network to another; Mobile IPv6 is very well suited
   for that purpose.  For such mobile nodes using Mobile IP, mobility
   management by the home agent can be extended to provide necessary
   information about the Signal Forwarding Functions (SFFs) that have
   been defined for WiMAX and for eHRPD/CDMA networks.  In this
   document, we explain the operations required to support single-radio
   mobile nodes and specify new extensions to Mobile IPv6 Binding Update
   and Binding Acknowledgement for supporting ease of access between
   mobile nodes and SFFs.

1.  Introduction

   There is growing interest to enable efficient handovers between
   heterogeneous radio access technologies (RATs) for networks owned by
   the same network operator, or network operators who have entered into
   roaming agreements.  Since authentication is indispensible for
   enabling the attachment of a mobile node, a mutually accessible
   authentication authority is indispensible for enabling efficient
   handovers between such operator networks.  Based on this
   authentication authority, we can develop trust relationships between
   agents in each network that are charged with responsibilities for
   aiding handovers.

   Wireless devices that are designed to attach to networks using
   heterogeneous RATs must include radio interfaces enabling
   connectivity to each desired RAT.  But each radio interface requires
   substantial power -- in fact, the radio interfaces for mobile
   wireless devices are quite often the biggest consumer of scarce
   battery power.  For this reason, today, and into the foreseeable
   future, most mobile wireless devices that have multiple radio
   interfaces will nevertheless only keep one of them powered on at any
   particular time.  Such devices are known as "single-radio" mobile
   nodes (MNs), notwithstanding the presence of multiple radio
   interfaces in each MN's hardware.

   Single-radio nodes present design challenges, because if only a
   single radio interface is powered on at any particular time, it is
   not possible for the device to be simultaneously connected to two
   different networks.  In such cases, handover protocols must try to
   compensate for the time during which the wireless device will be
   retuning its hardware to establish a link with the target network.
   This "break-before-make" mode of operation is susceptible to dropping
   packets during the time when the target radio access link is not yet
   established, but the link to the source network has already been
   released.

   For smooth handovers, it is imperative to reduce the time between
   release of one radio link and establishment of the new radio link at
   the target network.  Before the new link can be established in the
   target network, some or all of the following procedures must
   typically be followed:

      - Scheduling the radio link

      - Authenticating the mobile node

      - Creating proper context for the mobile node

      - Allocating data paths for traffic to/from the mobile node

   The specific details for each step vary quite a bit depending on the
   particular RAT used in the target network.  But, regardless of the
   particular target RAT, completing the listed procedures is too time
   consuming to enable smooth handovers when faced with the "break-
   before-make" nature of a single-radio MN.  For this reason, it is
   very important that the MN try to accomplish as many of the
   attachment procedures as possible before releasing its current radio
   link.  So, for instance, while MN is still attached to network N1, it
   may try to transfer context to a target base station in a target
   network N2.  In fact, almost all of the above procedures can be
   accomplished ahead of the actual radio link break, with operator
   agreement and mutual access to core network functions.  For ease of
   discussion, in this document all such handover optimizations will
   collectively be termed as "pre-registration".

   There has been considerable effort invested into protocol support for
   preregistration.  To do the signaling from the current network into
   the target network, the mobile node needs the following information
   about the target network:

      - Scheduling the radio link

      - location of basestation or access point

      - IP addresses of signaling endpoints for preregistration
      functional modules

      - Security association parameters for those signaling endpoints

   The latter requirement results from the possibility that
   preregistration signaling between the MN's current network and the
   target network may traverse the Internet, even though the networks
   are owned by the same operators or operators who have made roaming
   agreements.  It may be impracticable for such information to be
   preconfigured into each of the millions of subscriber devices roaming
   around today's wireless networks, and the number of devices continues
   to increase rapidly from year to year.  Given that, any
   preconfiguration strategy is likely to fail soon.

   Therefore, the MN must not only follow the require preregistration
   procedures for the target network, but it must also discover the
   necessary IP addresses for the target functional modules, and it must
   also establish a security relationship with each such target module.
   The discovery mechanisms for these handover agents typically involve

   DHCP or resolution of purpose-built DNS name.  The former approach
   could be integrated with other DHCP access procedures; using DNS
   affords a speed advantage to the latter approach.  One can reasonably
   ask how the MN might get access to the proper DHCP server or DNS
   server, especially given the emphasis on private addressing in
   today's networks.  Many restrictions and assumptions are required in
   order for the necessary information to be supplied to the MN.

   These discovery and security procedures are to be undertaken after
   the MN determines that it would be beneficial to move to a new
   network.  The benefit is typically for improved coverage, but in many
   cases also results from reduced cost or improved security or access
   to needed resources unavailable in the current network.  For whatever
   reason, after the determination is made, the MN cannot yet start to
   carry out its preregistration tasks.  The discovery and security
   tasks cannot be started until the target network can be identified,
   and the target network is closely associated with the current
   location of the MN.

   In summary, once the MN starts to move to a new network, the
   following are required:

      - Discovery of handover agent(s) in the target network

      - Security establishment with target agents

      - Pre-authentication using the security services trusted by the
      foreign network

      - Possibly other pre-registration tasks.

   Each of these procedures may require lengthy signaling transactions
   with the MN.  It is the goal of this document to specify a way to
   reduce the time delay associated with the first two tasks.  By doing
   so, it is expected that handover performance can be substantially
   improved.  Moreover, given reasonable assumptions about operator
   roaming agreements, it is likely that this proposal will be simpler
   to deploy and simpler for ongoing network management.

2.  Overview

   Recent documents describing handovers between cooperating networks
   supporting different radio technologies have specified a new
   functional module called a Signal Forwarding Function (SFF).  The SFF
   is the agent in the target network which assists the MN to carry out
   preregistration tasks while the MN still has radio access in its
   current network.  The details of the signaling between the MN and the
   SFF fundamentally depend on the requirements of the target network;
   it is out of scope for this document to specify any preregistration
   protocol exchange that the SFF would handle in the target network on
   behalf of the MN.  See Figure 1.

      Figure 1: MN at current PoA signaling via SFF in target network

      Here, Network A is the current point of attachment for the MN, and
      Network B is the target network.  MN signals to SFF in Network B
      to prepare for the handover from Network A into Network B.

   The SFF in the target network relays the MN signals to the network
   elements in the Radio Access Network (RAN) which will offer radio
   access to the MN.

   SFF behavior has been specified in detail for eHRPD/CDMA networks as
   well as for WiMAX networks.  For a variety of reasons, seemingly not
   all technical, 3GPP has chosen to recommend instead a more integrated
   approach for interworking between LTE networks and other target
   networks.  Notably, LTE handovers are specified under the assumption
   that the MN's address belongs to the LTE operator.  WiMAX and HRPD
   network technologies are more friendly to assisting MN's that are
   addressable from via domains supporting other RATs.

   Signaling between single-radio MNs and the SFF in a target network
   may follow protocol under development in the 802.21(c) task group
   under the auspices of IEEE 802.  This document can be viewed as a
   companion document to the SFF-based handover assistance being defined
   within 802.21(c).

   As the MN moves from one network to another, the SFF that was the
   target SFF becomes the SFF in the MN's current network.  We observe
   that for operators offering SFF modules for handovers between
   heterogeneous network types, the SFF in the MN's current network
   (which can be called the "originating network") can manage security
   associations with SFFs in neighboring networks belonging to roaming
   partners.  Such security associations facilitate a simplified
   approach for the necessary discovery and security establishment
   between a MN and a target SFF, as follows.

   When the MN completes its handover to a target network, it will have
   a security association with the SFF in that target network.  If the
   MN maintains this security association, then it can make use of the
   SFF in that network to assist in discovery and secure communication
   with a future SFF in a future target network.  The abbreviation TSFF
   will be used for the target SFF, and the SFF in the MN's current
   network will be called the "Originating SFF", abbreviated OSFF.  With
   that terminology, the handover between the originating network and
   the target network can be made faster using the services of the OSFF
   and the TSFF.  See Figure 2.

           Figure 1: MN handover preparation via OSFF and TSFF

      Again, Network A is the current point of attachment for the MN,
      and Network B is the target network.  MN initially relays signals
      to TSFF (in Network B) by way of OSFF (in Network A) to prepare
      for the handover from Network A into Network B.

   Specifically, when the MN has determined that a handover is
   beneficial, the following services should be offered by the OSFF:

      - The OSFF should be able to identify the proper TSFF to help the
      MN with handover to the target network.

      - The OSFF should be able to provide a shared key to establish a
      security association between the MN and the TSFF.

   In other words, the OSFF enables optimized discovery and security
   establishment for the TSFF and thus substantially simplifies and
   shortens the handover preparation time needed by the MN.  When the MN
   arrives at the target network, the TSFF becomes the OSFF and the MN
   has a security association with the OSFF useful for future handover
   services.

3.  Co-locating SFF in the home network with the Home Agent

   The foregoing overview does not explain how a MN might best get
   information about the SFF in the network providing the MN's initial
   point of attachment (PoA).

   Up until this point in the current document, there has been no
   attention paid for the need of the MN to maintain IP address
   continuity as it moves from the originating network to a target
   network.  For this purpose, the MN can use Mobile IPv6[RFC3775] (or
   Mobile IP for IPv4 devices[RFC3344]).  The Binding Update (BU) from
   the MN is, more often than not, transmitted as soon as the MN has
   established a radio link at the target network; alternatively, the BU
   could be sent just as the radio link between the MN and the

Internet-Draft          SFF Extensions for MIPv6                Jul 2011


   originating network were to be broken.  This latter approach as the
   advantage of reducing the amount of time during which the home agent
   would be routing packets to the wrong network, but would not work as
   well if the target network required a long time to establish a new
   radio link.

   When the mobile node (MN) is making its initial point of attachment,
   it does not yet need the services of any SFF.  The MN could get the
   required address of the SFF and establish a security association at
   any time after its initial attachment procedures have completed.  In
   this document, it is proposed that this information be delivered by
   the home agent as part of the Mobile IPv6 registration procedure.
   Furthermore, it is proposed that the SFF function in the home domain
   should be co-located with the home agent in that domain.  Doing so
   has several advantages, as follows:

      - The home agent is a natural repository for mobility management
      functions such as SFF.  If the home agent is co-located with the
      SFF in the MN's home domain, it can readily assist the MN with
      handovers from any visited network back to the home network.  This
      is expected to be a very frequent case.

      - The MN naturally already has a security association with the
      home agent.  When the home agent is co-located with home SFF
      (i.e., HSFF), then the all of the necessary procedures for finding
      and securing communications with SFFs in all visited networks of
      roaming partners can be accomplished without any additional need
      for DHCP or IKEv2.

      - The MN is already required to securely transmit a BU to its home
      agent.  Adding a new extension to the BU, requesting the IP
      address and shared key for the local SFF is economical and
      introduces fewer error conditions.

      - In the typical case where the MN begins its initial network
      attachment in its home network, the MN can rely on its home agent
      as an OSFF for future handovers to target networks.

      - For handovers from WiFi into any network of roaming partner, the
      MN can utilize its home agent/HSFF as an OSFF to establish
      preregistration signaling with any desired target network enabled
      for roaming.

   Given the appropriate security model between roaming partners, co-
   locating the SFF function with the home agent in the home network
   enables also reduces the number of mobility agents requiring
   configuration and management.

Internet-Draft          SFF Extensions for MIPv6                Jul 2011


   In this document, only signaling elements for Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) are
   specified.  Similar extensions to Registration Request and
   Registration Reply for Mobile IPv4 can readily be specified.

   The following extension to the Binding Update of MIPv6 is needed so
   that the MN can request information about the SFF in the network
   providing its care-of address

      - SFF address Request (SFF-REQ)

   The following extension to the Binding Acknowledgement is needed so
   that the HA can request information about the SFF to the requesting
   MN

      - SFF address Reply (SFF-REP)

   The SFF in the MN's current network (i.e., OSFF) will be tasked with
   enabling security associations between the MN and a future target
   SFF.  Therefore the MN will require a security association with OSFF,
   and there does not appear to be a need for providing an "SFF address
   Request" extension that does not also imply a simulataneous request
   for key material to establish the security association with OSFF.

   The Home Agent MAY supply an SFF-REP extension to the MN in its BAck
   even when the MN has not requested it, if the MN is known by
   preconfiguration or other means to support the ability to utilize
   OSFF for handover assistance.

   It is presumed in this initial version of the SFF-REQ and SFF-REP
   specification that the MN's care-of address is sufficient for the
   home agent to determine the proper and roaming network to which the
   OSFF belongs, and thus be able to determine the IP address for the
   OSFF.  Future versions of this specification may specify additional
   location information to be included with the Binding Update.

4.  Extension Formats

   The SFF-REQ may only appear in a Binding Update IPv6 Mobility Header,
   and the SFF-REP may only appear in a Binding Acknowledgement IPv6
   Mobility Header.

4.1.  SFF-REQ (SFF Parameters Request)

   A mobile node (MN) inserts the SFF-REQ extension appear in a Binding
   Update Header to request that the home agent supply information about
   the SFF in the network providing the Care-of Address to the MN.

   SFF IPv6 Address

      The SFF IPv6 Address (128 bits)

   HA_SPI

      HA_SPI (32 bits) is used by the MN to select the proper Mobility
      Security Association with its home agent so that it can use the
      correct security parameters in its computation to recover the SFF
      key.

   Encrypted SFF key

      Encrypted SFF key (at least 128 bits)

   SFF SPI

      The SFF SPI (32 bits) is used by the MN as needed for any future
      secure communications with the SFF in the network supporting its
      current Care-of Address.  This same SPI will be also be used by
      the SFF for its secure communications with the MN.

   The home agent first picks a random number to be used for K_sff, the
   desired shared key between MN and SFF.  Then, the home agent computes
   the Encrypted Key as follows, using the parameters it supplies in the
   SFF-REP:

      Encrypted SFF key = [K_sff (+) HMAC_SHA1 (SFFaddr, SFF_SPI)]

   where:

      K_sff is the desired shared key between MN and SFF

      Encrypted SFF key hides K_sff for transmission to the MN

      (+) is XOR

      HMAC_SHA1[RFC2401] is the algorithm to be used by the Home Agent
      to encrypt the K_sff for delivery in encrypted form to the mobile
      node.  HMAC_SHA1 uses the key forming the basis of the mobility
      security association (indexed by HA_SPI) between the MN and the HA

      SFFaddr is the IPv6 address of the SFF

      SFF_SPI is the SPI of the security association between the MN and
      SFF, used here simply as a random number.

   The mobile node computes the following value from the parameters in

   the SFF-REP:

      K_sff = [Encrypted SFF key (+) HMAC_SHA1 (SFFaddr, SFF_SPI)]

   where:

      K_sff is the desired shared key between MN and SFF

      (+) is XOR

      HMAC_SHA1[RFC2401] is the algorithm to be used by the MN to
      recover the K_sff delivered in encrypted form by the home agent.
      HMAC_SHA1 uses the key forming the basis of the mobility security
      association (indexed by HA_SPI) between the MN and the HA

      SFFaddr is the IPv6 address of the SFF

      SFF_SPI is the SPI of the security association between the MN and
      SFF, used here simply as a random number.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document uses techniques from RFC 2104 (and RFC 3957) for key
   distribution.  Up until now, no security weaknesses have been
   reported for those techniques, as long as the basic encryption
   algorithms are themselves secure.  HMAC_SHA1 is recommended for
   encryption.

   In future revisions of this specification, SHA-256 or AES may be
   instead specified, since SHA-1 has been shown to have some potential
   vulnerabilities.  However, for low volume (comtrol plane) signaling,
   such vulnerabilities are unlikely to have any significant effect.

   This specification should be considered as an initial draft.  The
   exact nature of the algorithm used to compute the Encrypted Key field
   of the SFF-REP is subject to discussion and changes are likely.

   The home SFF (HSFF) colocated with home agent is also charged with
   the responsibility for supplying K_sff to the SFF in the network
   supporting the mobile node's Care-of Address (i.e., OSFF).  Messages
   currently undergoing specification within IEEE 802.21(c) and
   802.21(a) are likely to be used between HSFF and OSFF.  The nature of
   the algorithm used to provide confidentiality for the IEEE 802.21(c)
   messages between HSFF and OSFF may well be different than the
   algorithm used for SFF-REP computation.
