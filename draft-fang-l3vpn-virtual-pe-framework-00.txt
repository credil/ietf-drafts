1  Introduction

   Network virtualization is to provide multiple individual network
   services by sharing common available network resources. Network
   virtualization is not a new concept, for example, BGP layer 3 Virtual
   Private Networks (L3 VPNs) have been widely deployed to provide
   network based, service provider provisioned VPNs. It provides routing
   isolation and allow address overlapping among different VPNs while
   forward traffic over common network infrastructure.

   The recent development of server virtulization, provided the new
   opportunities for the virtual Provider Edge (vPE) solution on
   application end-system. The virtual PE solution can be powerful and
   attractive to service providers and enterprises in the fast growing
   cloud computing service and intelligent mobility environment. 

1.1 Overview

   L3 VPN Virtual Provider Edge may provide full or partial L3VPN PE
   functions or partial PE functions. The virtual PE has two components
   - control and forwarding. The control component can be a software
   instance resides in a physical device, most commonly seen in the end-
   system devices where multiple applications are supported, e.g.,
   mobile application server in a wireless call center, or an end-system
   in a SP virtual Private Cloud (vPC) data center, or a host in an
   Financial back-office. 

   The architecture and protocols defined in IETF for BGP/MPLS L3VPN
   [RFC4364] is the foundation for virtual PE solution. Certain protocol
   extensions or integration may be needed to support the virtual PE
   solutions.

   This document defines a framework for using standard protocols to
   build BGP L3 VPN with virtual PE solutions. The goal is to support
   large scale deployment and reduce operational complexity. The
   targeted environment can be virtualized wireless providers call
   centers, large scale service providers data centers, large enterprise
   central and branch facilities, and service provider managed
   services.

1.2 Scope of the document

   This focus of this document is BGP L3VPN virtual PE solutions. 

   It is assumed that the readers are familiar with BGP/MPLS L3VPN
   technologies, the base technology and operation will not be covered
   in this document.

2. Virtual PE Architecture and Reference Model

2.1 Virtual PE

   A virtual PE is a PE with control instance and a forwarding
   components reside in a shared physical device where multiple
   applications are supported. The control and forwarding components are
   decoupled, they may reside in the same or different physical devices.

INTERNET DRAFT              <Document Title>                <Issue Date>


   A key motivation of using virtual PE solution is to place the L3VPN
   termination point as close as possible to where the
   services/applications reside; and to take the advantage of control
   and forwarding decoupling for better scalability and allow flexible
   routing policy control and fast provisioning. In many cases, the
   virtual PE is placed in the service end systems where the Virtual
   Machines running various applications.

   As defined in [RFC4364], a L3VPN is created by applying policies to
   form a subset of sites among all sites connected the backbone
   network. It is collection of "sites". A site can be considered as a
   set of IP systems maintain IP inter-connectivity without connecting
   through the backbone. The typical use of L3VPM has been to inter-
   connect different sites of an Enterprise networks through Service
   Provider's L3VPN in the WAN. 

   The recent rapid adoption of Cloud Services, and the phenomenal
   growth of mobile IP applications, accelerate the needs to extend the
   VPN capability to the end-systems. Enterprise customers requests
   Service Providers to extend the L3VPN services in the WAN into the
   new Cloud services supported by various Data Center technologies.
   Mobile providers who have already adopted L3VPN into the Mobile
   infrastructure are looking to support service virtualization with
   L3VPN on the end-system of mobile applications.

2.2 Architecture reference model

   Figure 1 illustrate the topology that vPE is reside inside the end-
   system where the applications are hosted.

             Figure 1. Virtualized Service network with vPE



   The Virtualized Service Network in Figure 1 consists of WAN gateway
   PE devices, transport devices, and end-systems. 

   Examples of service network may be a network that supports cloud
   computing services, mobile call centers, and SP or enterprise private
   or public data centers. 

   The transport devices in the service network do not participate
   L3VPNs, they do not maintain the L3VPN states, they are not aware of
   the L3VPN in the network.

    Figure 2. Virtual L3 VPN PE logical connections in the End-system


   An end-system shown in Figure 2 is a virtualized server which hosting
   multiple VMs, the a virtual PE resides in the end-system. The vPE
   supports multiple VRFs, VRF Red, VRF Grn, VRF Yel, VRF Blu, etc. Each
   VM is associated to a particular VRF as a member of the particular
   VPN. For example, VM1 is associated to VRF Red, VM2 and VM47 are
   associated to RFC Grn, etc. Routing isolations apply between VPNs.

   The vPE connectivity relationship between vPE to VM is similar like
   the PE to CE in a regular BGP L3VPNs. 

   VM1 and VM2 can not connect to each other in a simple intranet VPN
   topology as shown in the configuration. The L3VPN provides routing
   isolation among different VPNs.

   considered here.

3.1 Router server of vPE

   A virtual PE consist the control plane element and the forwarding
   plane element. Since the proposed solution decoupled the two element,
   they may or may not reside on the same physical device.

   The Route Server of L3VPN vPE is a software application that
   implements the BGP/MPLS L3VPN PE control plane functionality.  

   In the case other control/signaling/messaging protocol are used (see
   options listed in the next sub-section), the route server is also the
   server of the particular protocol(s), it interacts with VPN forwarder
   (see the section on forwarding).

3.2 Control plane options of vPE

   a. MP-BGP

   MP-BGP can be used in service network where both the end system
   implementation and operation work force has the knowledge and skills
   to support it. In this case, the design and deployment is very
   similar to what applies to regular L3VPN deployment.

   b. Extensible messaging protocols

   It is redeemed as a good alternative for bridging the gap between
   Gateway PE and the vPE where operators could not support BGP.  

   Although the modern end-systems may be able to support MP-BGP, the
   operational support of the computing and storage community often may
   not have the adequate BGP skills or willingness to step up to BGP
   operation. Since this is a common situation today, an light weight,
   extensible IP protocol is very welcome by the cloud service
   communities. One example of such protocol is to use XMPP to signal
   L3VPN connectivity between the Gateway PE the virtual PE on the end-
   systems. The technology solution is described in details in [I-
   D.ietf-l3vpn-end-system]. 

   c. Controller

   This is a SDN approach. In the virtual PE implementation, not only
   the service network infrastructure and the VPN overlay networks are
   decoupled, but also the vPE control plane and data plane are
   physically decoupled. The control plane directing the data flow may
   reside elsewhere, such a centralized controller. This requires
   standard interface to routing system (IRS). The IRS work is in

   progress in IETF, [ID.ward-irs-framework], [ID.rfernando-irs-
   framework-requirement]. 

3.3 Use of router reflector

   Modern service networks can be very large in scale, the very large
   data centers can easily pass the scale of SP backbone VPN networks.
   The end-systems and therefore the vPEs may be several thousand in a
   single service network. 

   Use of Router Reflector (RR) is necessary in large scale L3VPN
   networks to avoid full iBGP mesh among all vPEs and PEs. The L3 VPN
   routes can be partitioned to a set of RRs, the partition techniques
   are detailed in [RFC4364]. 

   When RR is residing a device which is partitioned to support multi-
   functions and application, the RR become virtualized RR (vRR). Since
   RR's is control plane only, a physical or virtualized server with
   large scale of computing power and memory can be a perfect candidate
   as host of vRRs. The vRR can be in Gateway PE, or an end-system.

3.4 Use of RT constraint

   The Route Target Constraint [RFC4684] is a powerful tool for VPN
   route filtering. With RT constraint, only the BGP receiver (a PE,
   vPE, RR, vRR, ASBRs, etc.) with the particular L3VPN routes will
   receive the route update. It is critical to use RT constraint
   particularly in large scale development. 

4. Forwarding Plane

4.1 Virtual Interface

   Virtual Interface (VI) is an interface in an end-system which is used
   for connecting the vPE to the VMs or other applications in the end-
   system. The later can be viewed as CEs in traditional L3VPN scenario.

4.2 VPN forwarder

   VPN Forwarder is the forwarding component of a vPE solution.

   The VPN forwarder location options:

   1) within the end-system where the virtual interface is 

   2) in an external device of end-system which the end-system connect
   to, for example, a ToR.

   Multiple factors should be considered for the location of the VPN
   forwarder, including device capability, overall economy,
   QoS/firewall/NAT placement, optimal forwarding, latency and
   performance, etc. There are design trade offs, it is worth the effort
   to study the traffic pattern and forwarding looking trend in your own
   unique service network as part of the exercise.

4.3 Encapsulation

   There are two existing standardized forwarding options for BGP/MPLS
   L3VPN.

       1. MPLS Encapsulation, [RFC3032].

       2. Encapsulating MPLS in IP or Generic Routing Encapsulation
   (GRE), [RFC4023]. 

   The most common BGP/MPLS L3VPNs deployment in SP networks are using
   MPLS forwarding. This requires MPLS to be deployed in the network. It
   is proven to scale and provide various security mechanism to against
   attacks.

   The service network environment, such as a data center, is different
   than Service Provider VPN networks or large enterprise backbones.
   MPLS deployment may or may not be feasible. Two major challenges for
   MPLS deployment in the new environment: 1) the capabilities for the
   end-system devices or transport/forwarding devices; 2) the workforce
   skill set. 

   Encapsulating MPLS in IP or GRE tunnel may be more practical in many
   cases. But bare in mind, IP or GRE tunnel does not provide the same
   level of security mechanism as MPLS forwarding. 

   There are new encapsulation proposals for service network/Data center
   as work in progress in IETF, including several UDP based
   encapsulations proposals and some TCP based proposals. These
   mechanism may be considered as alternative to MPLS and IP/GRE encap.

4.4 Optimal forwarding

   As reported by many large cloud service operators, the traffic
   pattern in their data centers are dominated by East-West traffic
   (between the end-systems hosting different applications) than North-
   South traffic (going in and out the DC to the WAN). This is a key
   reason that many large scale new design has moved away from
   traditional L2 design to L3. 

   When forwarding the traffic within the same VPN, the end-system
 


<Luyuan Fang>           Expires <Feb. 15, 2013>                [Page 11]

INTERNET DRAFT              <Document Title>                <Issue Date>


   should be able to access directly between the VMs/application
   sender/receivers without the need of going through gateway devices.
   If it is on the same end-system, the traffic should not need to leave
   the same device. If it is on different end-system, optimal routing
   should be applied. 

   When multiple VPNs need to be accessed to accomplish the task the
   user requested (this is common too), the end-system virtual
   interfaces should be able to directly access multiple VPNs in
   extranet VPN style without the need of Gateway facilitation. BGP
   L3VPN policy control is the tool to support this function. 

5. Addressing

5.1 IPv4 and IPv6 support

   Both IPv4 and IPv6 should be supported in the virtual PE solution.

   This may present challenging to older devices, but may not be issues
   to newer forwarding devices and servers. A server is replaced much
   more frequently than a network router/switch in the infrastructure
   network. Newer equipment most likely support IPv6. 

5.2 Address space separation

   The addresses used for L3VPNs in the service network should be in
   separate address blocks than the ones used the underlay
   infrastructure of the service network. This practice is to protect
   the service network infrastructure being attacked if the attacker
   gain access of the tenant VPNs.

   Similarity, the addresses used for the service network, e.g., a cloud
   service center of a SP, should be separated from the WAN backbone
   addresses space, for security reasons. 

7.  Security Considerations

   To be added.

8.  IANA Considerations

   None.
