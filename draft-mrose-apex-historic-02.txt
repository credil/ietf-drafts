1.  Introduction

   The Application Exchange (APEX) service is defined in four RFCs:
   [RFC3340], [RFC3341], [RFC3342], and [RFC3343].

   To the author's knowledge, no implementations of these RFCs were ever
   deployed.

   To the author's knowledge, all of APEX's functionality is currently
   provided by XMPP ([RFC3920], and [RFC3921], and [RFC3923]), which
   enjoys extrodinarily robust deployment.

   Accordingly, the APEX RFCs are reclassified to Historic status.

2.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations section of the XMPP documents are
   considerably more detailed than those of the APEX documents, and are
   believed to provide security at least as strong as APEX.
   Accordingly, no decrease in security is envisioned.
