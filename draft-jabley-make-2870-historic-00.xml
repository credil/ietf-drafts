    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Domain Name System (DNS) protocol (<xref target="RFC1034"/>,
        <xref target="RFC1035"/>) as implemented and deployed on the
	Internet includes thirteen so-called "Root Servers". These
	servers are authoritative-only DNS servers which answer
	authoritatively for the root zone of the DNS, often denoted
	by a single period ("."). The operators of such servers are
        known as Root Server Operators.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC2870"/> was originally published to
        document operational requirements for Root Server Operators.</t>

      <t>This document reclassifies <xref target="RFC2870"/> to
	Historic. This memo also obsoletes <xref target="RFC2870"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Guidance for Root Server Operation">
      <t>Guidance to Root Server Operators, and information
        which might help set expectations of Root Server Operators
        by the rest of the technical community, can be found in
        <xref target="RSSAC001"/>. This document is a product of the
        ICANN Root Server System Advisory Committee (RSSAC).</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Reclassification of RFC 2870 to Historic">
      <t><xref target="RFC2870"/> presented a set of technical
	implementation and operational requirements for Root Servers.
	It included detailed requirements for service implementation
	that were useful for the time in which the document was
	published; however, that guidance has decreased in relevance
	as experience with large-scale authoritative DNS server
	deployment has increased.  Modern DNS infrastructure typically
	incorporates a variety of deployment techniques intended
	to facilitate very high query rates, and in the modern
	environment any Root Server built precisely to the specification
	presented in <xref target="RFC2870"/> would be grossly
	inadequate. Today, <xref target="RFC2870"/> provides value
	only as a part of the historical record of the ongoing
	development of the DNS.</t>

      <t>This document directs the RFC Editor to mark the document
        <xref target="RFC2870"/> as historic.</t>
