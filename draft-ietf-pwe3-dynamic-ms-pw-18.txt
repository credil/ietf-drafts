Abstract

   There is a requirement for service providers to be able to extend the
   reach of pseudowires (PW) across multiple Packet Switched Network
   domains. A Multi-Segment PW is defined as a set of two or more
   contiguous PW segments that behave and function as a single point-
   to-point PW. This document describes extensions to the PW control
   protocol to dynamically place the segments of the multi-segment
   pseudowire among a set of Provider Edge (PE) routers. This document
   also updates the length value of the PW Switching Point PE Sub-TLV

1. Introduction

1.1. Scope

   [RFC5254] describes the service provider requirements for extending
   the reach of pseudowires across multiple Packet Switched Network
   (PSN) domains. This is achieved using a Multi-segment Pseudowire
   (MS-PW). An MS-PW is defined as a set of two or more contiguous PW
   segments that behave and function as a single point-to-point PW. This
   architecture is described in [RFC5659].

   The procedures for establishing PWs that extend across a single PSN
   domain are described in [RFC4447], while procedures for setting up
   PWs across multiple PSN domains, or control plane domains are
   described in [RFC6073].

   The purpose of this document is to specify extensions to the
   pseudowire control protocol [RFC4447], and [RFC6073] procedures, to
   enable multi-segment PWs to be dynamically placed. The procedures
   follow the guidelines defined in [RFC5036] and enable the reuse of
   existing TLVs, and procedures defined for SS-PWs in [RFC4447].
   Dynamic placement of point-to-multipoint (P2MP) PWs is for further
   study and outside the scope of this document.




1.2. Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


1.3. Terminology

   [RFC5659] provides terminology for multi-segment pseudowires.

   This document defines the following additional terms:

     - Source Terminating PE (ST-PE). A Terminating PE (T-PE), which
       assumes the active signaling role and initiates the signaling for
       multi-segment PW.
     - Target Terminating PE (TT-PE). A Terminating PE (T-PE) that
       assumes the passive signaling role. It waits and responds to the
       multi-segment PW signaling message in the reverse direction.

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-pwe3-dynamic-ms-pw-18.txt   October 7, 2013


     - Forward Direction: ST-PE to TT-PE.
     - Reverse Direction: TT-PE to ST-PE.
     - Pseudowire Routing (PW routing): The dynamic placement of the
       segments that compose an MS-PW, as well as the automatic
       selection of S-PEs.



1.4. Architecture Overview

   The following figure shows the reference model, derived from
   [RFC5659], to support PW emulated services using multi-segment PWs.

                 Figure 1: MS-PW Reference Model


   T-PE1 and T-PE2 provide an emulated  service to CE1 and CE2. These
   PEs reside in different PSNs.  A PSN tunnel extends from T-PE1 to S-
   PE1 across PSN1, and a second PSN tunnel extends from S-PE1 to T-PE2
   across PSN2. PWs are used to connect the attachment circuits (ACs)
   attached to T-PE1 to the corresponding AC attached to T-PE2. A PW
   segment on the tunnel across PSN1 is connected to a PW segment in the
   tunnel across PSN2 at S-PE1 to complete the multi-segment PW (MS-PW)
   between T-PE1 and T-PE2. S-PE1 is therefore the PW switching point
   and is referred to as the switching provider edge (S-PE). PW Segment
   1 and PW Segment 3 are segments of the same MS-PW while PW Segment 2
   and PW Segment 4 are segments of another MS-PW. PW segments of the



Martini, et al.                                                 [Page 4]

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-pwe3-dynamic-ms-pw-18.txt   October 7, 2013


   same MS-PW (e.g., PW segment 1 and PW segment 3) MUST be of the same
   PW type, and PSN tunnels (e.g., PSN1 and PSN2) can be of the same or
   a different technology. An S-PE switches an MS-PW from one segment to
   another based on the PW identifiers ( PWid, or Attachment Identifier
   (AII)). How the PW protocol data units (PDUs) are switched at the S-
   PE depends on the PSN tunnel technology: in case of an MPLS PSN to
   another MPLS PSN, PW switching involves a standard MPLS label swap
   operation.

   Note that although Figure 1 only shows a single S-PE, a PW may
   transit more than one S-PE along its path. For instance, in the
   multi-provider case, there can be an S-PE at the border of one
   provider domain and another S-PE at the border of the other provider
   domain.


2. Applicability

   In this document we describe the case where the PSNs carrying the
   MS-PW are only MPLS PSNs using the Generalized PWID FEC element (also
   known as FEC129). Interactions with an IP PSN using L2TPv3 as
   described in [RFC6073] section 7.4 are for further study.


2.1. Changes to Existing PW Signaling

   The procedures described in this document make use of existing LDP
   TLVs and related PW signaling procedures described in [RFC4447] and
   [RFC6073]. The following optional TLV is also defined:
     - A Bandwidth TLV to address QoS Signaling requirements (see
       Section 6.2.1).

   This document also updates the length value of the PW Switching Point
   PE Sub-TLV Type 0x06 to 14.


3. PW Layer 2 Addressing

   Single segment pseudowires on an MPLS PSN can use attachment circuit
   identifiers for a PW using FEC 129. In the case of a dynamically
   placed MS-PW, there is a requirement for the attachment circuit
   identifiers to be globally unique, for the purposes of reachability
   and manageability of the PW.  Referencing figure 1 above, individual
   globally unique addresses MUST be allocated to all the ACs and S-PEs
   of an MS-PW.

3.1. Attachment Circuit Addressing

   The attachment circuit addressing is derived from [RFC5003] AII type
   2, shown here:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                 Figure 2: AII Type 2 TLV Structure


   The fields are defined in [RFC5003], Section 3.2.

   AII type 2 based addressing schemes permit varying levels of AII
   summarization, thus reducing the scaling burden on PW routing. AII
   Type 2 based PW addressing is suitable for point-to-point
   provisioning models where auto-discovery of the address at the Target
   T-PE is not required.  That is, it is known a-priori by provisioning.

   Implementations of the following procedure MUST interpret the AII
   type to determine the meaning of the address format of the AII,
   irrespective of the number of segments in the MS-PW. All segments of
   the PW MUST be signaled with same AII Type.

   A unique combination of Global ID, Prefix, and AC ID parts of the AII
   type 2 are assigned to each AC. In general, the same global ID and
   prefix are be assigned for all ACs belonging to the same T-PE. This
   is not a strict requirement, however. A particular T-PE might have
   more than one prefix assigned to it, and likewise a fully qualified
   AII with the same Global ID/Prefix but different AC IDs might belong
   to different T-PEs.

   For the purpose of MS-PWs, the AII MUST be globally unique across all
   PSNs that are spanned by the MS-PW.

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-pwe3-dynamic-ms-pw-18.txt   October 7, 2013


3.2. S-PE Addressing

   Each S-PE MUST be assigned an address which uniquely identifies it
   from a pseudowire perspective, in order to populate the Switching
   Point PE (SP-PE) TLV specified in [RFC6073]. For this purpose, at
   least one Attachment Identifier (AI) address of the format similar to
   AII type 2 [RFC5003] composed of the Global ID, and Prefix part,
   only, MUST be assigned to each S-PE.

   If an S-PE is capable of Dynamic MS-PW signaling, but is not assigned
   with an S-PE address, then on receiving a Dynamic MS-PW label mapping
   message the S-PE MUST return a Label Release with the
   "LDP_RESOURCES_UNAVAILABLE" ( 0x38)" status code.


4. Dynamic Placement of MS-PWs

   [RFC6073] describes a procedure for concatenating multiple
   pseudowires together. This procedure requires each S-PE to be
   manually configured with the information required for each segment of
   the MS-PW. The procedures in the following sections describe a method
   to extend [RFC6073] by allowing the automatic selection of pre-
   defined S-PEs, and dynamically establishing a MS-PW between two T-
   PEs.


4.1. Pseudowire Routing Procedures

   The AII type 2 described above contains a Global ID, Prefix, and AC
   ID. The Target Attachment Individual Identifier (TAII) is used by S-
   PEs to determine the next SS-PW destination for LDP signaling.

   Once an S-PE receives a MS-PW label mapping message containing a TAII
   with an AII that is not locally present, the S-PE performs a lookup
   in a PW AII routing table. If this lookup results in an IP address
   for the next-hop PE with reachability information for the AII in
   question, then the S-PE will initiate the necessary LDP messaging
   procedure to set-up the next PW segment. If the PW AII routing table
   lookup does not result in a IP address for a next-hop PE, the
   destination AII has become unreachable, and the PW setup MUST fail.
   In this case the next PW segment is considered un-provisioned, and a
   label release MUST be returned to the T-PE with a status message of
   "AII Unreachable".

   If the TAI of a MS-PW label mapping message received by a PE contains
   the prefix matching a locally-provisioned prefix on that PE, but an
   AC ID that is not provisioned, then the LDP liberal label retention
   procedures apply, and the label mapping message is retained.



Martini, et al.                                                 [Page 7]

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-pwe3-dynamic-ms-pw-18.txt   October 7, 2013


   To allow for dynamic end-to-end signaling of MS-PWs, information must
   be present in S-PEs to support the determination of the next PW
   signaling hop.  Such information can be provisioned (equivalent to a
   static route) on each S-PE, or disseminated via regular routing
   protocols (e.g. BGP).


4.1.1. AII PW Routing Table Lookup Aggregation Rules

   All PEs capable of dynamic MS-PW path selection MUST build a PW AII
   routing table to be used for PW next-hop selection.

   The PW addressing scheme (AII type 2 in [RFC5003]) consists of a
   Global ID, a 32 bit prefix and a 32 bit Attachment Circuit ID.

   An aggregation scheme similar to that used for classless IPv4
   addresses can be employed. An (8 bits) length mask is specified as a
   number ranging from 0 to 96 that indicates which Most Significant
   Bits (MSB) are relevant in the address field when performing the PW
   address matching algorithm.

    0        31 32    63 64    95 (bits)
   +-----------+--------+--------+
   | Global ID | Prefix | AC ID  |
   +-----------+--------+--------+

                 Figure 3: PW Addressing Scheme


   During the signaling phase, the content of the (fully qualified) TAII
   type 2 field from the FEC129 TLV is compared against routes from the
   PW Routing table. Similar with the IPv4 case, the route with the
   longest match is selected, determining the next signaling hop and
   implicitly the next PW Segment to be signaled.


4.1.2. PW Static Route

   For the purpose of determining the next signaling hop for a segment
   of the pseudowire, the PEs MAY be provisioned with fixed route
   entries in the PW next hop routing table. The static PW entries will
   follow all the addressing rules and aggregation rules described in
   the previous sections.  The most common use of PW static provisioned
   routes is this example of the "default" route entry as follows:

   Global ID = 0 Prefix = 0 AC ID = 0 , Prefix Length = 0 Next Signaling
   Hop = {IP Address of next hop S-PE or T-PE}




Martini, et al.                                                 [Page 8]

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-pwe3-dynamic-ms-pw-18.txt   October 7, 2013


4.1.3. Dynamic Advertisement with BGP

   Any suitable routing protocol capable of carrying external routing
   information MAY be used to propagate MS-PW path information among S-
   PEs and T-PEs. However, T-PEs and S-PEs MAY choose to use Border
   Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC4721] with the Multiprotocol Extensions as
   defined in [RFC4760] to propagate PW address information throughout
   the PSN.

   Contrary to layer 2 VPN signaling methods that use BGP [RFC6074] for
   auto discovery, in the case of the dynamically placed MS-PW, the
   source T-PE knows a-priori (by provisioning) the AC ID on the
   terminating T-PE that signaling should use. Hence there is no need to
   advertise a "fully qualified" 96 bit address on a per PW Attachment
   Circuit basis. Only the T-PE Global ID, Prefix, and prefix length
   needs to be advertised as part of well known BGP procedures - see
   [RFC4760].

   Since PW Endpoints are provisioned in the T-PEs, the ST-PE will use
   this information to obtain the first S-PE hop (i.e., first BGP next
   hop) to where the first PW segment will be established. Any
   subsequent S-PEs will use the same information (i.e. the next BGP
   next-hop(s)) to obtain the next-signaling-hop(s) on the path to the
   TT-PE.

   The PW dynamic path Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) is
   advertised in BGP UPDATE messages using the MP_REACH_NLRI and
   MP_UNREACH_NLRI attributes [RFC4760]. The [AFI, SAFI] value pair used
   to identify this NLRI is (AFI=25, SAFI=6 (pending IANA allocation)).
   A route target MAY also be advertised along with the NLRI.

   The Next Hop field of the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute SHALL be
   interpreted as an IPv4 address, whenever the length of the NextHop
   address is 4 octets, and as a IPv6 address, whenever the length of
   the NextHop address is 16 octets.

   The NLRI field in the MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI is a prefix
   comprising an 8-octet Route Distinguisher, the Global ID, the Prefix,
   and the AC-ID, and encoded as defined in section 4 of [RFC4760].

   This NLRI is structured as follows:










Martini, et al.                                                 [Page 9]

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-pwe3-dynamic-ms-pw-18.txt   October 7, 2013


    Bit
    0     7 8             71 72      103 104  135 136   167
    +------+----------------+-----------+--------+--------+
    |Length|  Route Dist    | Global ID | Prefix | AC ID  |
    +------+----------------+-----------+--------+--------+

                Figure 4: NLRI Field Structure



   The Length field is the prefix length of the Route Distinguisher +
   Global ID + Prefix + AC-ID in bits.

   Except for the default PW route, which is encoded as a 0 length
   prefix, the minimum value of the length field is 96 bits. Lengths of
   128 bits to 159 bits are invalid as the AC ID field cannot be
   aggregated. The maximum value of the Length field is 160 bits. BGP
   advertisements received with invalid prefix lengths MUST be rejected
   as having a bad packet format.


4.2. LDP Signaling

   The LDP signaling procedures are described in [RFC4447] and expanded
   in [RFC6073]. No new LDP signaling components are required for
   setting up a dynamically placed MS-PW. However, some optional
   signaling extensions are described below.

   One of the requirements that MUST be met in order to enable the QoS
   objectives for a PW to be achieved on a segment is that a PSN tunnel
   MUST be selected that can support at least the required class of
   service and that has sufficient bandwidth available.

   Such PSN tunnel selection can be achieved where the next hop for a PW
   segment is explicitly configured at each PE, whether the PE is a T-PE
   or an S-PE in the case of a segmented PW, without dynamic path
   selection (as per RFC6073). In these cases, it is possible to
   explicitly configure the bandwidth required for a PW so that the T-PE
   or S-PE can reserve that bandwidth on the PSN tunnel.

   Where dynamic path selection is used and therefore the next-hop is
   not explicitly configured by the operator at the S-PE, a mechanism is
   required to signal the bandwidth for the PW from the T-PE to the S-
   PEs. This is accomplished by including an optional PW Bandwidth TLV.
   The PW Bandwidth TLV is specified as follows:

                 Figure 5: PW Bandwidth TLV Structure



   The PW Bandwidth TLV fields are as follows:

     - TLV Length: The length of the value fields in octets. Value = 64

     - Forward SENDER_TSPEC = The SENDER_TSPEC for the forward direction
       of the PW, as defined in [TSPEC] section 3.1.

     - Reverse SENDER_TSPEC = The SENDER_TSPEC for the reverse direction
       of the PW, as defined in [TSPEC] section 3.1.


   The complete definitions of the content of the SENDER_TSPEC objects
   are found in [TSPEC] section 3.1. The forward SENDER_TSPEC refers to
   the data path in the direction of ST-PE to TT-PE. The reverse
   SENDER_TSPEC refers to the data path in the direction TT-PE to ST-PE.

   In the forward direction, after a next hop selection is determined, a
   T/S-PE SHOULD reference the forward SENDER_TSPEC object to determine
   an appropriate PSN tunnel towards the next signaling hop. If such a
   tunnel exists, the MS-PW signaling procedures are invoked with the
   inclusion of the PW Bandwidth TLV. When the PE searches for a PSN
   tunnel, any tunnel which points to a next hop equivalent to the next
   hop selected will be included in the search (the LDP address TLV is
   used to determine the next hop equivalence)

   When an S/T-PE receives a PW Bandwidth TLV, once the PW next hop is
   selected, the S/T-PE MUST request the appropriate resources from the
   PSN.  The resources described in the reverse SENDER_TSPEC are
   allocated from the PSN toward the originator of the message or
   previous hop. When resources are allocated from the PSN for a
   specific PW, the SHOULD account for the usage of the resources by the
   PW.

   In the case where PSN resources towards the previous hop are not



Martini, et al.                                                [Page 11]

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-pwe3-dynamic-ms-pw-18.txt   October 7, 2013


   available, the following procedure MUST be followed:
        -i. The PSN MAY allocate more QoS resources, e.g. Bandwidth, to
            the PSN tunnel.
       -ii. The S-PE MAY attempt to setup another PSN tunnel to
            accommodate the new PW QoS requirements.
      -iii. If the S-PE cannot get enough resources to setup the segment
            in the MS-PW a label release MUST be returned to the
            previous hop with a status message of "Bandwidth resources
            unavailable"

   In the latter case, the T-PE receiving the status message MUST also
   withdraw the corresponding PW label mapping for the opposite
   direction if it has already been successfully setup.

   If an ST-PE receives a label mapping message the following procedure
   MUST be followed:

   If the ST-PE has already sent a label mapping message for this PW
   then the ST-PE MUST check that this label mapping message originated
   from the same LDP peer to which the corresponding label mapping
   message for this particular PW was sent. If it is the same peer, the
   PW is established.  If it is a different peer, then the ST-PE MUST
   send a label release message, with a status code of "Duplicate AII"
   to the PE that originate the LDP label mapping message.

   If the PE has not yet sent a label mapping message for this
   particular PW , then it MUST send the label mapping message to this
   LDP peer, regardless of what the PW TAII routing lookup result is.


4.2.1. Equal Cost Multi Path (ECMP) in PW Routing

   A next hop selection for a specific PW may find a match with a PW
   route that has multiple next hops associated with it. Multiple next
   hops may be either configured explicitly as static routes or may be
   learned through BGP routing procedures. Implementations at and S-PE
   or T-PE MAY use selection algorithms, such as CRC32 on the FEC TLV,
   for load balancing of PWs across multiple next-hops. The details of
   such selection algorithms are outside the scope of this document.


4.2.2. Active/Passive T-PE Election Procedure

   When a MS-PW is signaled, each T-PE might independently initiate
   signaling the MS-PW. This could result in a different path being used
   be each direction of the PW. To avoid this situation one T-PE MUST
   initiate PW signaling (i.e. take an active role), while the other T-
   PE waits to receive the LDP label mapping message before sending the



Martini, et al.                                                [Page 12]

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-pwe3-dynamic-ms-pw-18.txt   October 7, 2013


   LDP label mapping message for the reverse direction of the PW (i.e.
   take a passive role). The Active T-PE (the ST-PE) and the Passive T-
   PE (the TT-PE) MUST be identified before signaling begins for a given
   MS-PW.

   The determination of which T-PE assumes the active role SHOULD be
   done as follows: the Source Attachment Individual Identifier (SAII)
   and TAII are compared as unsigned integers, if the SAII is bigger
   then the T-PE assumes the active role.


4.2.3. Detailed Signaling Procedures

   On receiving a label mapping message, the S-PE MUST inspect the FEC
   TLV. If the receiving node has no local AII matching the TAII for
   that label mapping then the label mapping message should be forwarded
   on to another S-PE or T-PE. The S-PE will check if the FEC is already
   installed for the forward direction:
     - If it is already installed, and the received mapping was received
       from the same LDP peer to which the forward LDP label mapping was
       sent, then this label mapping represents signaling in the reverse
       direction for this MS-PW segment.
     - If it is already installed, and the received mapping was received
       from a different LDP peer to which the forward LDP label mapping
       was sent, then the received label mapping MUST be released with
       the status code of "PW_LOOP_DETECTED".
     - If the FEC is not already installed, then this represents
       signaling in the forward direction.

   For the forward direction:
        -i. Determine the next hop S-PE or T-PE according to the
            procedures above. If next-hop reachability is not found in
            the PW AII routing table in the S-PE then label release MUST
            be sent with status code "AII_UNREACHABLE". If the next-hop
            S-PE or T-PE is found and is the same LDP Peer that has sent
            the label mapping message then a label Release MUST be
            returned with the status code "PW_LOOP_DETECTED". If the
            SAII in the received label mapping is local to the S-PE then
            a label released MUST be returned with status code
            "PW_LOOP_DETECTED".
       -ii. Check that a PSN tunnel exists to the next hop S-PE or T-PE.
            If no tunnel exists to the next hop S-PE or T-PE the S-PE
            MAY attempt to setup a PSN tunnel.
      -iii. Check that a PSN tunnel exists to the previous hop. If no
            tunnel exists to the previous hop S-PE or T-PE the S-PE MAY
            attempt to setup a PSN tunnel.





Martini, et al.                                                [Page 13]

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-pwe3-dynamic-ms-pw-18.txt   October 7, 2013


       -iv. If the S-PE cannot get enough PSN resources to setup the
            segment to the next or previous S-PE or T-PE, a label
            release MUST be returned to the T-PE with a status message
            of "Resources Unavailable".
        -v. If the label mapping message contains a Bandwidth TLV,
            allocate the required resources on the PSN tunnels in the
            forward and reverse directions according to the procedures
            above.
       -vi. Allocate a new PW label for the forward direction.
      -vii. Install the FEC for the forward direction.
     -viii. Send the label mapping message with the new forward label
            and the FEC to the next hop S-PE/T-PE.

   For the reverse direction:
        -i. Install the received FEC for the reverse direction.
       -ii. Determine the next signaling hop by referencing the LDP
            sessions used to setup the PW in the Forward direction.
      -iii. Allocate a new PW label for the reverse direction.
       -iv. Install the FEC for the reverse direction.
        -v. Send the label mapping message with a new label and the FEC
            to the next hop S-PE/ST-PE.


5. Failure Handling Procedures

5.1. PSN Failures

   Failures of the PSN tunnel MUST be handled by PSN mechanisms. If the
   PSN is unable to re-establish the PSN tunnel, then the S-PE SHOULD
   follow the procedures defined in Section 8 of [RFC6073].


5.2. S-PE Specific Failures

   For defects in an S-PE, the procedures defined in [RFC6073] SHOULD be
   followed. A T-PE or S-PE may receive an unsolicited label release
   message from another S-PE or T-PE with various failure codes such
   "LOOP_DETECTED", "PW_LOOP_DETECTED", "RESOURCE_UNAVAILBALE",
   "BAD_STRICT_HOP", "AII_UNREACHABLE", etc. All these failure codes
   indicate a generic class of PW failures at an S-PE or T-PE.

   When an unsolicited label release message with such a failure status
   code is received at T-PE then the T-PE MUST re-attempt to establish
   the PW immediately. However the T-PE MUST throttle its PW setup
   message retry attempts with an exponential backoff in situations
   where PW setup messages are being constantly released.  It is also
   recommended that a T-PE detecting such a situation take action to
   notify an operator.



Martini, et al.                                                [Page 14]

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-pwe3-dynamic-ms-pw-18.txt   October 7, 2013


   S-PEs that receive an unsolicited label release message with a
   failure status code should follow the following procedures:

        -i. If the label release is received from an S-PE or T-PE in the
            forward signaling direction then the S-PE MUST tear down
            both segments of the PW. The status code received in the
            label release message SHOULD be propagated when sending the
            label release for the next-segment.
       -ii. If the label release is received from an S-PE or T-PE in the
            reverse signaling direction, then then tear down both
            segments of the PW as described in i.


5.3. PW Reachability Changes

   In general an established MS-PW will not be affected by next-hop
   changes in L2 PW reachability information.

   If there is a change in next-hop of the L2 PW reachability
   information in the forward direction, the T-PE MAY elect to tear down
   the MS-PW by sending a label withdraw message to downstream S-PE or
   T-PE. The teardown MUST be also accompanied by a unsolicited label
   release message, and will be followed by and attempt to re-establish
   of the MS-PW by T-PE.

   If there is a change in the L2 PW reachability information in the
   forward direction at S-PE, the S-PE MAY elect to tear down the MS-PW
   in both directions. A label withdrawal is sent on each direction
   followed by a unsolicited label release. The unsolicited label
   releases MUST be accompanied by the Status code "AII_UNREACHABLE".
   This procedure is OPTIONAL.

   A change in L2 reachability information in the reverse direction has
   no effect on an MS-PW.


6. Operations and Maintenance (OAM)

   The OAM procedures defined in [RFC6073] may be used also for MS-PWs.
   A PW switching point TLV is used [RFC6073] to record the switching
   points that the PW traverses.

   In the case of a MS-PW where the PW Endpoints are identified though
   using a globally unique, FEC 129-based AII addresses, there is no
   PWID defined on a per segment basis. Each individual PW segment is
   identified by the address of adjacent S-PE(s) in conjunction with the
   SAI and TAI. In this case, the following TLV type (0x06) MUST be used
   in place of type 0x01 in the PW switching point TLV:



Martini, et al.                                                [Page 15]

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-pwe3-dynamic-ms-pw-18.txt   October 7, 2013


   Type      Length    Description
   0x06        14      L2 PW address of PW Switching Point


   The above field MUST be included together with type 0x02 in the TLV
   once per individual PW Switching Point following the same rules and
   procedures as described in [RFC6073]. A more detailed description of
   this field is also in setion 7.4.1 of [RFC6073]. However, note that
   the length MUST be set to 14.


7. Security Considerations

   This document specifies only extensions to the protocols already
   defined in [RFC4447], and [RFC6073]. Each such protocol may have its
   own set of security issues, but those issues are not affected by the
   extensions specified herein. Note that the protocols for dynamically
   distributing PW Layer 2 reachability information may have their own
   security issues, however those protocols specifications are outside
   the scope of this document.



8. IANA Considerations

8.1. Corrections

   IANA needs to correct a minor error in the registry "Pseudowire
   Switching Point PE sub-TLV Type". The entry 0x06 "L2 PW address of
   the PW Switching Point" should have Length 14.


8.2. LDP TLV TYPE NAME SPACE

   This document defines one new LDP TLV types. IANA already maintains a
   registry for LDP TLV types called "Type, Length,  and Value (TLV)
   Type Name Space" within the "Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)
   Parameters" as defined by RFC5036. The IANA is requested to assign on
   permanent basis the value (0x096E) that has been assigned to this
   document by early allocation (TEMPORARY - Expires 2008-11-21).:

   Value   Description     Reference       Notes/Registration Date

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-pwe3-dynamic-ms-pw-18.txt   October 7, 2013


8.3. LDP Status Codes

   This document defines three new LDP status codes. IANA maintains a
   registry of these called the "STATUS CODE NAME SPACE" in the "Label
   Distribution Protocol (LDP) Parameters" as defined by RFC5036. The
   IANA is requested to assign on permanent basis the values that has
   been assigned to this document by early allocation
    (TEMPORARY - Expires 2008-11-21):


   Range/Value     E     Description                       Reference

    0x00000039     0     AII Unreachable                   This document


8.4. BGP SAFI

   IANA needs to allocate a new BGP SAFI for "Network Layer Reachability
   Information used for Dynamic Placement of Multi-Segment Pseudowires"
   from the IANA "Subsequence Address Family Identifiers (SAFI)"
   registry. The IANA is requested to assign on permanent basis the
   values that has been assigned to this document by early allocation
   (TEMPORARY - Expires 2008-11-21)::
