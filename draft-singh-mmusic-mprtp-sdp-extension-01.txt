    Multipath RTP (MPRTP) attribute in Session Description Protocol
               draft-singh-mmusic-mprtp-sdp-extension-01

Abstract

   Multipath RTP (MPRTP) is an extension to the Real-time Transport
   Protocol (RTP) that allows multi-homed endpoints to take advantage of
   the availability of multiple Internet paths between endpoints to
   send/receive media packets.  This document describes how to express
   the interface advertisement and negotiation during session setup in
   SDP (Session Description Protocol).

Internet-Draft            Multipath RTP in SDP              January 2013


1.  Introduction

   Multipath RTP (MPRTP) [I-D.singh-avtcore-mprtp] is an extension to
   RTP [RFC3550] that allows splitting a single RTP stream into multiple
   subflows, which are then transmitted over different Internet paths.
   Multipath RTCP (MPRTCP) [I-D.singh-avtcore-mprtp] is an extension to
   RTCP.  It is used along with MPRTP to report per-path sender and
   receiver characteristics.

   A Multipath RTP session can be set up in many possible ways e.g.,
   during handshake, or upgraded mid-session.  The capability exchange
   may be done using out-of-band signaling (e.g., Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) [RFC3264] in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   [RFC3261], Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis]) or using in-band signaling (e.g., in
   RTCP [I-D.singh-avtcore-mprtp]).

   This document defines an extension to the SDP attribute 'a=mprtp'
   defined in the base MPRTP specification [I-D.singh-avtcore-mprtp].
   Using this extension an endpoint can advertise its multiple
   interfaces.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   The definitions for the words Endpoint, Interface, Path and Subflow
   in this document are as per [I-D.singh-avtcore-mprtp].


2.  SDP Considerations

   The base Multipath RTP specification [I-D.singh-avtcore-mprtp]
   defines the 'a=mprtp' attribute to indicate support for MPRTP.  In
   the following section, we extend the 'a=mprtp' attribute to advertise
   an endpoint's multiple interfaces in SDP instead of advertising the
   interfaces in-band in RTCP [I-D.singh-avtcore-mprtp].

2.1.  MPRTP Interface Advertisement in SDP (out-of-band signaling)

   If the endpoint is aware of its multiple interfaces and wants to use
   them for MPRTP, it MAY use SDP to advertise these interfaces.
   Alternatively, it MAY use in-band signaling to advertise its
   interfaces, as defined in [I-D.singh-avtcore-mprtp].  The receiving

Internet-Draft            Multipath RTP in SDP              January 2013


   endpoint MUST use the same mechanism to respond to an interface
   advertisement.  In particular, if an endpoint receives an SDP
   containing multiple MPRTP interfaces, then it MUST respond to the
   offer in SDP with its set of MPRTP interfaces.

2.1.1.  "interface" attribute

   The interface attribute is an optional media-level attribute and is
   used to advertise an endpoint's interface address.

   The syntax of the interface attribute is defined using the following
   Augmented BNF, as defined in [RFC5234].  The definitions of unicast-
   address, port, token, SP, and CRLF are according to RFC4566
   [RFC4566].

       mprtp-optional-parameter = mprtp-interface
                      ; other optional parameters may be added later

       mprtp-interface = "interface" ":" counter SP unicast-address
                           ":" rtp_port
                            *(SP interface-description-extension)

       counter = 1*DIGIT
       rtp_port = port    ;port from RFC4566

   <mprtp-interface>: specifies one unicast IP address, the RTP port
   number of the endpoint (MPRTP [I-D.singh-avtcore-mprtp] uses RTP/RTCP
   port multiplexing).  The unicast address with lowest counter value
   MUST match the connection address ('c=' line).  Similarly, the RTP
   and RTCP ports MUST match the RTP and RTCP ports in the associated
   'm=' line.  The counter SHOULD start at 1 and increment with each
   additional interface.  Multiple interface lines MUST be ordered in a
   decreasing priority level as is the case with the Interface
   Advertisement blocks in in-band signaling (See
   [I-D.singh-avtcore-mprtp]).

   <unicast-address>: is taken from RFC4566 [RFC4566].  It is one of the
   IP addresses of the endpoint and allows the use of IPv4 addresses,
   IPv6 addresses and Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN).  When
   choosing IPv6 addresses the endpoint MUST perform the IPv6 address
   prioritization and selection as proposed in
   [I-D.keranen-mmusic-ice-address-selection].

   <port>: is from RFC4566 [RFC4566].  It is the RTP port associated
   with the unicast address and note that the RTP and RTCP ports are
   multiplexed for MPRTP subflows according to [RFC5761].

   <counter>: is a monotonically increasing positive integer starting at

Internet-Draft            Multipath RTP in SDP              January 2013


   1.  The counter MUST reset for each media line.  The counter value
   for an 'mprtp-interface' should remain the same for the session,
   unless the priorities of the interfaces change.

   [Editor's note: do we need a counter?]

   The 'mprtp-interface' can be extended using the 'interface-
   description-extension' parameter.  An endpoint MUST ignore any
   extensions it does not understand.

2.1.2.  Example

   The ABNF grammar is illustrated by means of an example:

   v=0
   o=alice 2890844526 2890844527 IN IP4 192.0.2.1
   s=
   c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1
   t=0 0
   m=video 49170 RTP/AVP 98
   a=rtpmap:98 H264/90000
   a=fmtp:98 profile-level-id=42A01E;
   a=extmap:1 urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext:mprtp
   a=rtcp-mux
   a=mprtp interface:1 192.0.2.1:49170    ;primary interface
   a=mprtp interface:2 198.51.100.1:51372    ;additional interface

2.2.  MPRTP with ICE

   If the endpoints intend to use ICE [RFC5245] for discovering
   interfaces and running connectivity checks, the following two step
   procedure MUST be followed:

   1.  Advertise ICE candidates: in the initial OFFER the endpoints
       exchange candidates, as defined in ICE [RFC5245].  Thereafter the
       endpoints run connectivity checks.

   2.  Advertise MPRTP interfaces: When a sufficient number of
       connectivity checks succeed, the endpoint MUST send an updated
       offer containing the interfaces that they want to use for MPRTP.

   When an endpoint uses ICE's regular nomination [RFC5245] procedure,
   it chooses the best ICE candidate as the default path.  In the case
   of an MPRTP endpoint, if the connectivity check of more than one ICE
   candidate succeeded, then an MPRTP endpoint MAY advertise (some of)
   these as MPRTP interfaces in an updated offer.

   When an endpoint uses ICE's aggressive nomination [RFC5245]



Singh, et al.             Expires July 14, 2013                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft            Multipath RTP in SDP              January 2013


   procedure, the selected candidate may change as more ICE checks
   complete.  Instead of sending updated offers as additional ICE
   candidates appear (transience), the endpoint MAY use in-band
   signaling to advertise its interfaces, as defined in
   [I-D.singh-avtcore-mprtp].  Additionally, it MAY send an updated
   offer when the transience stabilizes.

   If the default interface disappears and the paths used for MPRTP are
   different from the one in the c= and m= lines then the 'mprtp
   interface' with the lowest counter value should be promoted to the c=
   and m= lines in the updated offer.

   When a new interface appears, then the application/endpoint should
   internally decide if it wishes to use it and sends an updated offer
   with ICE candidates of the new interface.  The receiving endpoint
   responds to the offer with all its ICE candidates in the answer and
   starts connectivity checks between all its candidates and the
   offerer's new ICE candidate.  Similarly, the initiating endpoint
   starts connectivity checks between the new interface and all the
   received ICE candidates in the answer.  If the connectivity checks
   succeed, the initiating endpoint MAY send an updated offer with the
   new interface as an additional 'mprtp interface'.

2.3.  Offer/Answer

   When SDP [RFC4566] is used to negotiate MPRTP interfaces (see
   Section 2.1) following the offer/answer model [RFC3264], the
   collection of "a=mprtp interface" attribute lines indicates the
   interfaces the endpoint wishes to use for sending and/or receiving
   media data.  The SDP offer MUST include this attribute at the media
   level.  If the answerer wishes to also use SDP for advertising MPRTP
   interfaces, it MUST also include its interfaces at the media-level
   "a=mprtp interface" attribute in the answer.  If the answer does not
   contain an "a=mprtp interface" attribute, the offerer MUST use in-
   band signaling [I-D.singh-avtcore-mprtp] for advertising interfaces.

   When SDP is used in a declarative manner, the presence of an "a=mprtp
   interface" attribute signals that the sender can send or receive
   media data over multiple interfaces.  The receiver SHOULD be capable
   of streaming media to the multiple interfaces and be prepared to
   receive media from multiple interfaces.

   The following sections shows examples of SDP offer and answer for in-
   band and out-of-band signaling.

2.3.1.  In-band Signaling Example

   The following offer/answer shows that both the endpoints are MPRTP
   capable and SHOULD use in-band signaling for interfaces
   advertisements.

   Offer:
     v=0
     o=alice 2890844526 2890844527 IN IP4 192.0.2.1
     s=
     c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1
     t=0 0
     m=video 49170 RTP/AVP 98
     a=rtpmap:98 H264/90000
     a=fmtp:98 profile-level-id=42A01E;
     a=rtcp-mux
     a=mprtp


   Answer:
     v=0
     o=bob 2890844528 2890844529 IN IP4 192.0.2.2
     s=
     c=IN IP4 192.0.2.2
     t=0 0
     m=video 4000 RTP/AVP 98
     a=rtpmap:98 H264/90000
     a=fmtp:98 profile-level-id=42A01E;
     a=rtcp-mux
     a=mprtp

   The endpoint MAY now use in-band RTCP signaling to advertise its
   multiple interfaces.  Alternatively, it MAY make another offer with
   the interfaces in SDP (out-of-band signaling).

2.3.2.  Out-of-band Signaling Example

   If multiple interfaces are included in an SDP offer then the receiver
   SHOULD respond to the request with an SDP answer containing one or
   more interfaces.  If the SDP answer does not contain "a=mprtp", the
   offerer can conclude that the endpoint does not support MPRTP and
   continue the session using a single path.

2.3.2.1.  Without ICE

   In this example, the offerer advertises two interfaces and the
   answerer responds with a single interface description.  The endpoint
   MAY use one or both paths depending on the end-to-end characteristics

2.3.2.2.  With ICE

   In this example, the endpoint first sends its ICE candidates in the
   initial offer and the other endpoint answers with its ICE candidates.

   Initial offer (with ICE candidates):

   Thereafter, each endpoint conducts ICE connectivity checks and when
   sufficient number of connectivity checks succeed, the endpoint sends
   an updated offer.  In the updated offer, the endpoint advertises its
   multiple interfaces for MPRTP.

   Updated offer (with MPRTP interfaces):

2.4.  Increased Throughput

   The MPRTP layer MAY choose to augment paths to increase throughput.
   If the desired media rate exceeds the current media rate, the
   endpoints MUST renegotiate the application specific ("b=AS:xxx")
   [RFC4566] bandwidth.


3.  MPRTP in RTSP

   Endpoints MUST use RTSP 2.0 [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis] for session
   setup.  Endpoints MUST multiplex RTP and RTCP on a single port
   [RFC5761] and follow the recommendations made in Appendix C of
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis].

   1.  The RTSP Server should include all of its interfaces via the SDP
       attribute ("a=mprtp interface") in the RTSP DESCRIBE message.

   2.  The RTSP Client should include its multiple interfaces in the
       RTSP SETUP message using the new attribute ("dest_mprtp_addr=")
       in the Transport header.

   3.  The RTSP Server responds to the RTSP SETUP message with a 200 OK
       containing its MPRTP interfaces (using the "src_mprtp_header=")
       in the Transport header.  After this, the RTSP Client can issue a
       PLAY request.

   4.  If a new interface appears or an existing one disappear at the
       RTSP Client during playback, it should send a new RTSP SETUP
       message containing the updated interfaces ("dest_mprtp_addr") in
       the Transport header.

   5.  If a new interface appears or an existing one disappears at the
       RTSP Server during playback, the RTSP Server should send a
       PLAY_NOTIFY message with a new Notify-Reason: "src-mprtp-
       interface-update".  The request must contain the updated
       interfaces ("dest_mprtp_addr") in the "MPRTP-Interfaces" header.

   6.  Alternatively, the RTSP Server or Client may use the RTCP (in-
       band) mechanism to advertise their interfaces.

   The overview is illustrated by means of an example:

   The RTSP Client can issue a PLAY request on receiving the 200 OK and
   media can start to stream once the RTSP Server receives the PLAY
   request.

3.2.  Solution Overview with ICE

   This overview uses the ICE mechanisms [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rtsp-nat]
   defined for RTSP 2.0 [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis].

   1.  The RTSP Server should include the "a=rtsp-ice-d-m" attribute and
       also indicate that it supports MPRTP by including the "a=mprtp"
       attribute in the SDP of the RTSP DESCRIBE message.

   2.  The client sends an RTSP SETUP message containing the D-ICE in
       lower level transport and ICE candidates in the Transport header.
       The RTSP Server and Client then follow the procedures (Steps 2 to
       8) described in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rtsp-nat].

   3.  When the connectivity checks conclude, the RTSP Client can send
       an updated RTSP SETUP message with its MPRTP interfaces (ICE
       candidates that were successful) in the Transport header
       ("dest_mprtp_addr=").  The RTSP Server responds to the RTSP SETUP
       message with a 200 OK containing its MPRTP interfaces (ICE
       candidates that were successful) in the Transport header
       ("src_mprtp_header=").  After receiving the 200 OK, the RTSP
       Client can issue the PLAY request.

Internet-Draft            Multipath RTP in SDP              January 2013


   4.  Alternatively, after the connectivity checks conclude, the RTSP
       Client can issue the PLAY request (Step 9 and 10 of
       [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rtsp-nat]) and the endpoints can use the RTCP
       (in-band) mechanism to advertise their interfaces.

   5.  If a new interface appears or an existing one disappears, the
       RTSP Client should issue an updated SETUP message with the new
       candidates (See Section 5.12 of [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rtsp-nat]) or
       the RTSP Server should send a PLAY_NOTIFY message (See Section
       5.13 of [I-D.ietf-mmusic-rtsp-nat]).  After connectivity checks
       succeed for the new interfaces, the RTSP Client can proceed with
       the instructions in Step 3 or 4.

   The overview is illustrated by means of an example:

   After the connectivity checks complete, the RTSP Client can send an
   updated RTSP SETUP message containing the MPRTP interfaces for which
   the connectivity checks were successful.  These steps are the same as
   the ones in the previous example.

3.3.  RTSP Extensions

3.3.1.  MPRTP Interface Transport Header Parameter

   This section defines a new RTSP Transport parameter for carrying
   MPRTP interfaces.  The transport parameters may only occur once in
   each transport specification.  The parameter can contain one or more
   MPRTP interfaces.  If the RTSP Server supports MPRTP it MUST include
   one or more MPRTP interfaces in the SETUP response.

3.3.2.  MPRTP Feature Tag

   A feature tag is defined for indicating MPRTP support in the RTSP
   capabilities mechanism: "setup.mprtp".  This feature tag indicates
   that the endpoint supports all the mandatory extensions defined in
   this specification and is applicable to all types of RTSP agents;
   clients, servers and proxies.

   The MPRTP compliant RTSP Client MUST send the feature tag
   "setup.mprtp" in the "Supported" header of all DESCRIBE and SETUP
   requests.

3.3.3.  Status Codes

   TBD

3.3.4.  New Reason for PLAY_NOTIFY

   A new value used in the PLAY_NOTIFY methods Notify-Reason header is
   defined: "src-mprtp-interface-update".  This reason indicates that
   the RTSP Server has updated set of MPRTP interfaces.

               Notify-Reas-val =/ "src-mprtp-interface-update"

   PLAY_NOTIFY requests with Notify-Reason header set to src-mprtp-
   interface-update MUST include a mprtp-interfaces header.

   The server SHALL support SETUP requests in PLAYING state if it is
   only updating the transport parameter (dest_mprtp_addr).  If the
   session is established using ICE then the RTSP Server and Client MUST
   also follow the procedures described for Re-SETUP in
