                 AS112 Nameserver Delegations for IPv6
                     draft-michaelson-as112-ipv6-02

Abstract

   To reduce longterm traffic to the DNS root servers and the IP6.ARPA
   authoritative servers, the IAB is requested to instruct the IANA to
   delegate a set of sub-domains of IP6.ARPA to the AS112 Project
   [RFC6304].  These domains represent IPv6 address prefixes that are
   not conventionally populated in the global reverse-DNS, including
   IPv6 prefixes that are not globally scoped and certain prefixes used
   in an anycast context.

   The reverse DNS query load associated with these IPv6 address
   prefixes appear to have unacceptable scaling consequences as IPv6
   uptake increases.  By delegating these sub-domains to the AS112
   project, the DNS query load can be passed to a distributed sink,
   reducing the query load on the root servers and the IP6.ARPA
   authoritative servers.

1.  Reverse DNS Delegation and Local-Use Addresses

   The IPv6 Addressing Architecture [RFC4291] and Unique Local IPv6
   Unicast Addresses [RFC4193] includes certain address prefixes that
   are not intended to be uniquely used in the global network as
   globally-scoped unicast addresses.  Such addresses include locally-
   scoped addresses, certain anycast addresses, and loopback addresses.

   While such addresses are not intended to be used in the same context
   as globally-scoped unicast addresses, their use in various local and
   global contexts is seen to trigger Domain Name System (DNS) [RFC1034]
   queries (of the form of "reverse lookups") corresponding to these
   addresses.  Since the addresses concerned generally have local rather
   than global significance, it is good practice for site administrators
   to ensure that such queries are answered locally [RFC6303].  However,
   it is not uncommon for such queries to follow the normal delegation
   path in the public DNS instead of being answered within the site.  It
   is not possible for public DNS servers to give useful answers to such
   queries, and the response to such reverse lookup queries from the
   global DNS is the "Name Error" RCODE described in [RFC1035], commonly
   termed "NXDOMAIN".

   When the reverse-DNS infrastructure receives a request for un-
   delegated sub-domains, the point of delegation of the last matched
   label along the name path to the root receives the query.  In the
   case of the IPv6 reverse delegation structure, this implies that the
   IP6.ARPA authoritative servers will receive the query load.  Because
   the sub-domain is not delegated, the server is obliged to answer with
   an NXDOMAIN response.  A large number of these DNS queries are
   repeated, further increasing the DNS query load imposed on the DNS
   root servers and the IP6.ARPA authoritative servers.

   This query load appears to have unacceptable scaling consequences as
   IPv6 uptake increases.  By delegating these sub-domains to the AS112
   project [RFC6304], the DNS query load can be passed off to a
   distributed dedicated server set, reducing the load through the DNS
   root and on the IP6.ARPA authoritative servers.

2.  IANA Considerations

   As per the provisions of [RFC3152], this document recommends the IAB
   to direct IANA to delegate the following IP6.ARPA reverse DNS zones
   to the AS112 project [RFC6304]:

   0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.ip6.arpa (Unspecified)
                             8.e.f.ip6.arpa (Link-Local Scope)
                             9.e.f.ip6.arpa (Link-Local Scope)
                             a.e.f.ip6.arpa (Link-Local Scope)
                             b.e.f.ip6.arpa (Link-Local Scope)
                             c.e.f.ip6.arpa (Site-Local Scope)
                             d.e.f.ip6.arpa (Site-Local Scope)
                             e.e.f.ip6.arpa (Site-Local Scope)
                             f.e.f.ip6.arpa (Site-Local Scope)
                           1.0.f.f.ip6.arpa (Interface-Local multicast scope)
                           2.0.f.f.ip6.arpa (Link-Local multicast scope)
                           4.0.f.f.ip6.arpa (Admin-Local multicast scope)
                           5.0.f.f.ip6.arpa (Site-Local multicast scope)
                           8.0.f.f.ip6.arpa (Organization-Local multicast scope)
                   0.0.0.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa (Teredo)
                   8.B.D.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa (Documentation Prefix)

   AS112 project servers should add these zones to their configuration,
   and terminate queries efficiently inside their service
   infrastructure.

   This delegation instruction is subject to further direction in the
   future from the IAB to IANA, as per the provisions of [RFC3152].

3.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations described in [RFC6304] also apply to
   local-use IPv6 addresses, and should be considered in the context of
   the use of these addresses.

   DNS queries may well identify the location of deployment of IPv6
   enabled equipment in private contexts, particularly when the reverse
   queries relate to local-use IPv6 addresses.  While operators of the
   DNS reverse servers should respect the privacy of data relating to
   individual queries made to these reverse address servers, the
   unintentional leakage of information beyond its intended scope of use
   and circulation represents a potential threat to the security of a
   local private network.  This direction to delegate these local-use
   IPv6 reverse address sub-domains does not substantially change the
   security risks of information leakage from private environments.

   The authors acknowledge the work of Joe Abley and William Maton and
   the DNSOPS Working Group in preparing the AS112 framework document
   for delegation of the private use address blocks in IPv4, and have
   used parts of their AS112 document as a template for these AS112
   delegation instructions in IPv6.  John Mann also provided much useful
   feedback.

5.  Changes

   [Note: This section is not for publication.]

5.1.  Changes since the -00 draft

   The multicast ranges were stripped back to the subset of scopes which
   do not have future specific applicability for a reverse-DNS registry
   under consideration by the multicast community of interest.

   mis-labelled Site-Local addresses were renamed (john mann)
