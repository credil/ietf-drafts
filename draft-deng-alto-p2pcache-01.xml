			<t> Uploading from peers located in a public WLAN hotspot has been reported to severely impact other
               		    current users' experiences, and raised caution from the operator's side who are willing to increasingly 
               		    participate in building public WLAN facilities to offload the explosive mobile data traffic from cellular networks.
               		    Cooperation between the network operator and the P2P service providers in form of intra-domain
		            P2P caches is expected to be an effective mechanism to solve the problem. This draft introduces considerations
			    on ALTO deployment in terms of P2P caches and discusses potential extensions to the ALTO protocol to standardize

		<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
			<t> P2P applications like file sharing and multimedia streaming are so popular that lots of P2P 
                technologies have been increasingly utilized throughout the world. The goal of Application-Layer Traffic 
                Optimization (ALTO) [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol] is to provide guidance to these applications, which have to 
                select one or several hosts from a set of candidates that are able to provide a desired resource.
            </t>
			<t> Meanwhile, since wireless accesses to Internet have become pervasive with widely deployed WLANs, 
                more and more people access Internet services via WLAN and the amount of P2P traffic in WLAN is 
                explosively growing. In addition to a huge number of individually setup WLANs at homes, there has 
                been an increasing trend for the government, organizations, and even traditional network operators 
                to set up publicly accessible WLAN facilities. Even though the service may be free of charge, to 
                use the resources effectively in a fair way, and to avoid congestion for the purpose of service 
                availability are vital for these public WLANs.
            </t>
			<t> However, recent statistics reveal that P2P traffic accounts for 80% in part of China Mobile's WLANs, 
                and traffic congestion at APs (access points) frequently occurs because of P2P applications. P2P 
                traffic in WLANs not only causes problems on their own delivery quality, but also degrades the 
                performance of other Internet applications in WLANs. 
            </t>

    <t>ALTO: application layer traffic optimization. For ALTO protocol,

	<t>AP: a wireless access point (WAP) is a device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network using WLAN. The AP usually connects to a AC as a standalone device, but it can also be an integral component of the router itself.</t>

	<t>AC: a wireless access controller (WAC) is the network entity that provides wire access via APs to the network infrastructure in the data plane, control plane, management plane, or a combination therein.</t>

	<t>Fowarding Cache: is a traditional content cache, which caches content flows from outside its coverage and serves subsequent requestors under its coverage for the content.</t>

	<t>Reverse Cache: is a special content cache proposed for WLAN accessing networks, which caches content flows from inside its coverage and serves subsequent requests from outside its coverage for the content.</t>

	<t>Bidirectional Cache: is a combination of a forwarding cache and a reverse cache.</t>

	<t>Transparent Cache: is a content cache deployed by network operators for third party SPs (e.g. P2P streaming services), which participates in the overlay's service provision implicitly via request redirection. </t>
	
	<t>Cooperative Cache: is a content cache deployed by network operators in cooperation with specific content deliverying SPs (e.g. P2P streaming services), which participates in the overlay's service provision explicitly. </t>

</section>

		<section title="Motivation">
			<t> On one hand, it is well accepted that compared to fixed networks, mobile networks have some special 
                characters, including small link bandwidth, high cost, limited radio frequency resource, and terminal 
                battery. Therefore, it is recommended by [I-D.ietf-alto-deployments] that in mobile network, the 
                usage of wireless link should be decreased as far as possible and be high-efficient. For example, 
                in the case of a P2P service, the clients in the fixed network should decrease the data transport 
                from the clients in the mobile networks, as well as the clients in the mobile networks should prefer 
                the data transmission from the clients in the fixed networks. 
            </t>
			<t> On the other hand, efforts have been put on using forwarding caches to optimize traffic pattern in 
                such scenarios, which demonstrates great improvement in user experience and considerable traffic 
                reduction at interworking points. What's more, owing to the characteristics of the DCF model in 
                802.11, there is an constant unfairness between uplink and downlink traffic in competing wireless 
                channel resources, which leads to downlink congestion in WLAN resultant from P2P traffic (which
                constitutes the major part of uploading traffic). However, traditional P2P cache (as a forward cache) 
                cannot help here, since it does nothing to stop a WLAN peer from uploading. Hence, bidirectional 
                caches are proposed, which contains a reverse cache as well as a forward cache can be deployed at 
                the AC (Access Controller). The reverse cache can provide uploading service instead of the WLAN peers under the AC's 
                coverage. As a result, the uplink bandwidth consumption at each AP can be reduced and the uplink 
                congestion can be alleviated effectively. Simulation results in file-sharing scenarios show that,
                employing cache instead of WLAN peers accelerates file transfer by 42% while improving 
                the throughput of other Internet applications under the same AP by 28%.
            </t>
			<t> With deployed P2P caches on the internal network, especially at a position as low as the AC-level, 
                it could be sub-optimal to simply use the accessing network type as the divider for different PIDs 
                and assign sufficient high cost within the wireless PID to prefer accessing remote peers over local 
                peers blindly.
            </t>
			<t> To this end, this draft discusses the optimal ALTO deployment recommendations for a P2P application 
                in terms of a wireless accessing network with network-deployed application-agnostic caches.
            </t>
			<t> In summary, the goal here is to illuminate applications through ALTO about these existing network 
                capabilities to make full use of them in achieving application performance improvement and network 
                cost reduction.

			<section title="Forwarding Cache for Wired subscribers">
			<t> Fig. 1 illustrates the proposed architecture of a traditional uni-directional P2P cache (or Forwarding Cache 
                for short) system for wired subscribers, deployed mainly for the purpose of reducing interworking 
                P2P traffic. Forwarding Caches are assumed to be deployed at the interworking gateways to maximize their 
                coverage for local subscribers. In tranparent mode, they buffer downloading content from outside 
                ISP networks, intercept the upcoming outgoing P2P requests from local subscribers and serve them 
                with cached content instead. In cooperative mode, they register to the tracker as a super peer and
                are under the regulation of the tracker's private protocol.

			<section title="Bidirectional Cache for WLAN subscribers">
			<t> Fig. 2 illustrates the proposed architecture of a bidirectional cache system 
                in WLAN. In a WLAN, all AP will connect to a device named AC, and the AC can be seen as the gateway 
                to Internet of the WLAN. For most settings, both the traffic flowing into the WLAN and the traffic 
                flowing out of the WLAN pass through the AC, hence Bidirectional Caches are assumed to be deployed at AC to 
                exploit the traffic locality. Besides the normal functions of a Forwarding Cache, A Bidirectional Cache in transparent
                mode buffers uploading content from inside the WLAN network, intercepts the upcoming outgoing P2P 
                responses from local WLAN subscribers and serve the correspondent requester (be it another local 
                WLAN subscriber or an outsider) with cached content instead. In cooperative mode, they register to 
                the tracker as a super peer and are under the regulation of the tracker's private protocol.

		<section title="Generalized cache architecture for intra-ISP networks">
			<t> Fig. 3 generalized the overall architecture of the potential P2P cache deployments inside an ISP 
                with various access network types. As it shows, P2P caches may be deployed at various levels, 
                including: the interworking gateway linking with other ISPs, internal access network gateways 
                linking with different types of accessing networks (e.g. WLAN, cellular and wired), and even 
                within an accessing network at the entries of individual WLAN sub-networks. Moreover, depending 
                on the network context and the operator's policy, each cache can be a Forwarding Cache or a Bidirectional Cache.

			<section title="Considerations for ALTO deployment with P2P Caches">
			<t> For wired network operator, forwarding caching effectively localizes the downloading 
                P2P traffic within the sub-net under its coverage resulting in reduction of network 
                cost for cross-boundary peer selection, whereas reverse caching blocks the uploading 
                traffic outside a wireless sub-net leading to elimination of network cost for wireless 
                uploading peer selection. In other words, caching between pairs of endpoints changes 
                the traffic cost along the way. 
            </t>
			<t> Therefore, it is expected that by cooperation between the network operator and the 
                P2P SP in buiding up various caching system and sharing information through ALTO protocol
                about thses facilities brings benefits to both party.
            </t>
            <t> In order to do that, it is proposed to use locations of caches as dividers of different DIPs to 
                guide intra-ISP network abstraction and mark costs among them according to the location and type of 
                relevant caches. 
            </t>
			
			<section title="Forwarding Cache: vertical separator from outsiders">
			<t> It is reasonable to use Forwarding Caches as separators for different DIPs, since it accelerates P2P 
                traffic in a particular direction, indicating varied costs among these adjacent partitions. 
                For instance as shown in Fig.3, assuming the L2 Cache in AN1 of ISP 2 network is a Forwarding Cache, 
                the downloading traffic from other local peers outside to AN1 can be buffered once and served 
                AN1 network subsequently. The cost from AN2 or AN3 to AN1 is reduced as result, but not vise 
                visa. In other words, the ISP 2 network should be sub-divided into {AN1} and {AN2, AN3}, and 
                the incoming P2P cost for {AN1} is reduced, for the sake of the L2 Forwarding Cache located at the entry 
                of AN1.

			<section title="Bidirectional Cache: horizontal division within insiders">
			<t> Since Bidirectional Cache are deployed in wireless accessing networks to further reduce the outgoing and 
                local-in-local-out traffic costs in both directions, it seems straightforward to join the adjacent 
                partitions together and modify the cost between insiders to zero. However, there is hidden layering 
                within the Bidirectional Cache coverage, as the blocking of uploading traffic only works for traffic traverse 
                pass the Bidirectional Cache. If the cache is located too high as to be outside a local routing subnet, the 
                local traffic flows within the subnet cannot benefit from the Bidirectional Cache.

			<section title="Question: selective caching">
			 <t>As there is both CAPEX and OPEX expenditures for dedicated P2P Cache devices, it may be 
                cost-efficient for caches to make buffering/serving decisions based on the popularity 
                of the specific content. How to expose this application-relevant information to ALTO under such 
                context is an open issue.
            </t>
            </section>
			<section title="Discussion: cooperative caching and ALTO extension">
            <t> Luckily, in the cooperative-mode, a cache is playing as a normal peer under the tracker, and the 
                latter can make the "right" decision in choosing in favor of the former under the guidance of 
                the ALTO response while the tracker itself would take care of the content availability problem.
                If the cache doesn't have the content in question, it would no appear in the peer list handed in
                to ALTO server by the tracker.
            </t>
            <t> In this case, the ALTO server can collect the information about caching sub-system in the network,
                identify those "caching" peers in the peer list of an cost request from an ALTO client, and arrange
                the returned rank list accordingly. For example, a simple candidate-ranking policy for a cost query 
                to a WLAN peer, could be caching peers at the begining, then inside wired peers, and lastly outside
                wired peers.
            </t>
            <t> Moreover, the P2P SP and WLAN network operator may benefit even more by group popular files accroding
                to peers' geographic location or access types, and adapt its internal caching scheduling decisions 
                about which files to be cached on which spot. In order to do that, it would be helpful that the ALTO
                server could provide to the client with the requesting peer's subscription types (i.e. wired/WLAN/
                celluar/...) as well as geographic locations.
