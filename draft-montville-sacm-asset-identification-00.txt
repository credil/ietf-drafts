Abstract

   Asset identification plays an important role in an organization's
   ability to quickly correlate different sets of information about
   assets.  This document provides the necessary constructs to uniquely
   identify assets based on known identifiers and/or known information
   about the assets.  This document describes the purpose of asset
   identification, a data model for identifying assets, methods for
   identifying assets, and guidance on how to use asset identification.
   It also identifies a number of known use cases for asset
   identification.

1.  Introduction

   One of the primary requirements for performing asset management is
   the ability to identify assets based on some set of data known about
   them.  Asset identification, the use of attributes and methods to
   uniquely identify an asset, allows for correlation of data across
   multiple sources, reporting of asset information across different
   organizations and databases, targeted actions against specific
   assets, and usage of asset data in other business processes.

   Unfortunately, neither a unified method nor a published specification
   for performing asset identification exists at this time.  Existing
   security automation specifications either do not consider asset
   identification or represent identification information differently
   than other specifications with which they interoperate.  This means
   that correlation of data relies on a transformation process between
   each specification, which is expensive and unreliable.  Creation of
   such a unified method and specification for performing asset
   identification would allow for greater interoperability, increased
   capabilities, and easier implementation of asset management
   processes.

   This Asset Identification specification describes a framework for how
   asset management processes and other specifications may identify
   assets using some set of information known or generated about the
   asset.  It describes the data model and representation of asset
   identification information and it provides requirements for consuming
   and producing identification information.  Requirements for usage of
   asset information and requirements for how the information that
   identifies assets is collected or generated are out of scope for this
   specification.

   For the purposes of this specification, an asset is considered to be
   anything that has value to an organization.  For example, computing
   devices are one form of asset that many organizations track.  This
   specification, however, does not limit asset identification to
   identifying computing devices; any type of asset may be identified.
   The specification itself provides constructs for identifying many
   types of assets, and users may extend the model to include other
   asset types if they wish to identify asset types that are not
   addressed in the specification.

   It is expected that other standards, data formats, tools, processes,
   and organizations will reference this specification to describe how
   to represent asset identification information.  This will ensure
   compatibility of asset identifications among these components and
   allow for improved asset management processes.

   While this specification was developed to support the immediate needs
   of the security automation community, it is expected that it will be
   valuable in general asset management processes both inside and
   outside of the security automation space.

1.1.  Purpose and Scope

   The purpose of this document is to define the Asset Identification
   specification, a standardized model for representing and identifying
   assets.

   The scope of this document is to give an introduction to Asset
   Identification, give guidelines on using Asset Identification,
   describe the Asset Identification data model, and document
   conformance requirements to comply with Asset Identification.  Other
   versions of Asset Identification and the associated component
   specifications, including emerging specifications and future
   versions, are not addressed here.

   Future versions of Asset Identification will be defined in distinct
   revisions of this document, each clearly labeled with a document
   revision number and the appropriate Asset Identification version
   number.

1.2.  Audience

   This specification is intended for authors of specifications that
   must support asset identifications, implementers of those
   specifications, system integrators composing architectures from tools
   that implement those specifications, and end users who wish to
   understand how these tools work.

1.3.  Document Structure

   The remainder of this document is organized into the following major
   sections:

   o  Section 2 defines the terms used within this specification and
      provides a list of common abbreviations.

   o  Section 3 describes how this specification fits with related
      standards and specifications.

   o  Section 4 defines the conformance requirements for asset
      identification.

   o  Section 5 gives an overview of asset identification.

Internet-Draft          SACM Asset Identification         September 2012


   o  Section 6 describes the asset identification data model
      constructs.

   o  Section 7 presents the asset identification schema.

   o  Appendix A recognizes the work of the original Asset
      Identification specification [IR7693].

   o  Appendix B describes possible use cases for asset identification.

   o  Appendix C explains how the specification can be extended.

1.4.  Document Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Both inline and indented forms use qualified names to refer to
   specific XML elements.  A qualified name associates a named element
   with a namespace.  The namespace identifies the specific XML schema
   that defines (and consequently may be used to validate) the syntax of
   the element instance.  A qualified name declares this schema to
   element association using the format prefix:element-name.  The
   association of prefix to namespace is defined in the metadata of an
   XML document and generally will vary from document to document.  In
   this specification, the conventional mappings listed in Table 1-1 are
   used.

3.  Relationship to Existing Standards and Specifications

   This specification defines the constructs and methods for
   representing asset identification information and thus can be
   leveraged by any other specification where identifying assets is
   required or beneficial.

   This specification uses several industry-standard mechanisms for
   representing identification information and providing conformance
   requirements.

   Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)TM is a structured naming scheme for
   information technology systems, platforms, and packages.  Based upon
   the generic syntax for Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI), CPE
   includes a formal name format.  CPE version 2.3 Well-Formed Names
   (WFN) are used as software- identifying information by this
   specification [CPE23].

   The extensible Address Language (xAL) by the Organization for the
   Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) is an XML
   standard format for representing international address information
   [XAL].  Asset Identification leverages xAL to represent address
   information for assets.

   The extensible Name Language (xNL) by OASIS is an XML standard format
   for representing the names of people and organizations.  [XNL] Asset
   Identification leverages xNL to represent the names of people and
   organizations.

4.  Conformance

   A product may want to claim conformance with this specification so
   that users and organizations can use the product with the assurance
   that the product can identify assets in a consistent and standard
   manner.  The ability for a product to identify assets in a standard
   manner increases the likelihood of interoperability between
   conforming products.  This section defines the criteria for products
   to claim conformance with this specification.

4.1.  Product Conformance

   Products are divided into two roles based on their use of asset
   identification information: consumers and producers.

   o  Consuming products ("consumers") must be able to receive and
      understand information in compliance with this specification.

   o  Producing products ("producers") must create asset identification
      information in a format compliant with this specification.

   A product may be both a consumer and producer.  The following
   subsections document the conformance requirements for the two types
   of products.

4.1.1.  Consumers

   Any consuming product claiming conformance to this specification MUST
   adhere to the following requirements.

   o  The consumer SHALL be capable of processing the identification
      information represented in constructs consistent with the Asset
      Identification data model without error.  See Section 6.

   o  The consumer MAY attempt to consume constructs that are invalid
      per the Asset Identification data model.  See Section 6.

   o  The consumer MAY consume extension identifiers and use them as an
      input into a matching process.  See Section 5.3.4.

   o  The consumer MUST NOT abnormally end, crash, or otherwise be
      unable to fully process asset identification elements that include
      extension identifiers.  It MAY ignore any information in extension
      identifiers.

Internet-Draft          SACM Asset Identification         September 2012


4.1.2.  Producers

   Any producing product claiming conformance to this specification MUST
   adhere to the following requirements.

   o  The producer SHALL accurately produce the asset identification
      element in XML consistent with the data model.  Section 6.

   o  When representing identification information, the producer SHOULD
      provide as much information as is sufficient to allow for a match.
      See Section 5.3.

   o  When representing identification information, the producer MAY
      provide as much or as little identifying information as allowed in
      the data model per other recommendations or tool capabilities.
      See Section 5.3.

   o  The producer MAY provide extension identifiers for any asset
      identification element.  See Section 5.3.4.

5.  Asset Identification Overview

   This section gives an overview of the Asset Identification model and
   its key concepts.

5.1.  Scope

   In order to support the variety of use cases discussed in Appendix A,
   the scope of this specification is limited to a description of how
   asset management tools can represent asset identification information
   when communicating it to other tools.  It is out of scope of this
   specification to recommend which identifiers to use or to require
   that identification information be collected in a certain way or from
   a certain place.  Higher-level specifications, tools, and
   organizations that implement Asset Identification, however, are
   encouraged to make these recommendations or specify these
   requirements in order to support the particular needs of their use
   cases.

   Additionally, the Asset Identification specification is not a
   mechanism for expressing information about an asset that is not
   related to asset identification.  Only elements that are used for
   identification are included in the core specification.  Asset
   Identification elements MUST NOT be used to represent information
   about an asset unless it is being used to identify that asset.

5.2.  Core Specification and Extension Points

   The core Asset Identification specification defines eleven asset
   types and definitions of how those asset types may be identified
   using a set of literal attributes and relationships to other assets.
   The core specification is intended to provide definitions for
   commonly used asset types and identification attributes; it is not
   intended to be an exhaustive list of all possible asset types and
   attributes that may be used for identification.  Anything explicitly
   defined in the asset identification schema and the asset
   identification controlled vocabulary for relationship identifiers is
   considered part of the core specification.

   There are several extension points in the Asset Identification data
   model to allow for identification of asset types beyond what is
   included in the core specification and to allow attributes or
   relationships outside of the core specification to be used to
   identify asset types that are included.  These extension points are:

   o  Additional asset types may be created by inheriting from any
      concrete or abstract "asset" data element in the core XML schema.

Internet-Draft          SACM Asset Identification         September 2012


   o  The core asset types may be enhanced by adding elements to the
      appropriate asset type as literal values in the "extended-
      information" element.

   o  Additional relationships can be defined by creating a separate
      vocabulary for relationship identifiers.

5.3.  Data Model Overview

   The Asset Identification data model consists of a set of asset types
   and a set of information that can be provided about each asset type.
   The asset types currently supported in this specification are:

   For the purposes of this specification the above asset types MUST be
   understood as defined in Section 2.

   The specification MAY be extended by Asset Identification producers
   to allow for other asset types as needed; however, it is OPTIONAL for
   Asset Identification consumers to support asset types not present in
   the core specification.

   For each asset type above, the specification has a core set of fields
   that may be provided in order to identify an asset of that type.  For
   example, an asset of type "person" may be identified by an email
   address, full name, telephone number, or birth date.  Any number of
   these fields may be populated in order to create an asset
   identification element.  Specifications, management environments,
   organizations, and tool vendors implementing Asset Identification are
   encouraged to recommend, restrict, or require that certain fields be
   populated or not populated; however, the specification itself does
   not do so.

   There are several different types of information that may be used to
   identify assets: literal identifiers, relationship identifiers,
   synthetic identifiers, and extension identifiers.  These four
   identifier types are differentiated only because they are represented
   differently in the data model.  No identifier type is intrinsically
   more or less valuable for performing asset identification than any
   other identifier type.

5.3.1.  Literal Identifiers

   Literal identifiers are the pre-defined fields containing literal
   values that may identify an asset.  For example, Media Access Control
   (MAC) address is an example of a literal identifier for a computing
   device.  Literal identifiers defined in Asset Identification MUST be
   properly processed without error by Asset Identification consumers.

5.3.2.  Synthetic Identifiers

   Synthetic identifiers are meant to be used when a database or process
   assigns an identifier.  For example, an employee is often assigned an
   employee identifier which may be used to track him or her across the
   organization.  These identifiers should be represented using the
   synthetic identifier construct: the namespace denotes the management
   domain for which the identifier is valid and the identifier contains
   the identifier itself.  Each asset type allows for a list of zero to
   many synthetic identifiers.  Synthetic identifiers MUST be properly
   processed without error by Asset Identification consumers.

5.3.3.  Relationship Identifiers

   Relationship identifiers are meant to be used when an asset may be
   identified based on a relationship to another asset.  For example, a
   system may be identified based on the fact that it is named "System
   1" and it is connected to network "INTERNAL".  Relationship types are
   represented as a controlled vocabulary.  Any relationships defined in
   the Asset Identification controlled vocabulary are core and MUST be
   processed without error by Asset Identification consumers.
   Relationships that are defined in other controlled vocabularies are
   considered extension identifiers and MAY be supported by Asset
   Identification consumers.

5.3.4.  Extension Identifiers

   Although this specification intends to support the most common types
   of information that are used to identify assets, certain users,
   organizations, or use cases may find that the core model does not
   support some fields that they need.  Asset Identification supports a
   producer's ability to provide these identifiers in any asset
   identification element through extension identifiers; however, it is
   OPTIONAL for consumers to process or understand these identifiers
   unless some other specification requires it.  Extension identifiers
   may include additional literal values as well as relationship
   identifiers that are outside of the Asset Identification controlled
   vocabulary.  Extension identifiers MUST be processed without error by
   consumers; however, consumers are encouraged to ignore identifying
   information that they do not understand and is not defined in the

   core schema, which ensures accurate correlation.

5.4.  Providing Asset Identifications

   In the absence of other guidance or requirements, Asset
   Identification providers SHOULD provide as much information as they
   have available in the core (non-extension) asset identification
   element.  Bandwidth constraints, other specifications, and tool
   intelligence MAY help define how much or which information SHOULD be
   provided beyond this recommendation.

5.5.  Consuming Asset Identifications

   Asset Identification consumers MUST be able to process literal
   identifiers, synthetic identifiers, relationship identifiers, and
   extension identifiers without error.  In this context, "process"
   simply means ingest without error and optionally use as an input in
   performing a matching.  Asset Identification consumers SHOULD process
   literal identifiers, synthetic identifiers, and relationship
   identifiers and support incorporating them into a matching process.
   Asset Identification consumers SHOULD NOT incorporate unknown
   extended identifiers into a matching process as they may be
   misleading or misunderstood.

   Extended identifiers that are defined in another specification or
   policy that the consumer implements MAY be supported as appropriate
   and as defined by that specification or policy.

5.6.  Matching

   Matching is the process of determining whether or not two or more
   asset identification elements are referring to the same asset.
   Matching is performed across an entire asset identification element,
   not across each individual property of an identifier.

   Although matching identifiers is an important part of the asset
   identification process, due to a wide variety of current tool
   practices, organizational architectures, and the need to allow for
   innovation, this specification does not provide any normative
   requirements in regards to matching.  Tools are free to perform
   matching based on their own logic, and specifications implementing
   asset identification are encouraged to provide their own
   recommendations or requirements around matching.

5.7.  Sample Correlation Workflow

   The diagram in Figure 1 shows a sample correlation workflow,
   including matching discoverable information and several synthetic

   identifiers.

   In this sample architecture, which is merely one example, several
   tools report on information about an asset.  The information is
   correlated by an asset database, potentially processed or aggregated,
   and then reported to a higher-level database.

                   Figure 1: Sample Correlation Workflow

   In step 1, a host-based scanner is reporting on asset information
   (e.g. vulnerability assessment results) using a synthetic identifier
   in its own namespace and an IP address as identifying information.
   Additionally, a network scanner is reporting on network events by IP
   address.  This allows the asset database to correlate information
   coming from the network with information on the host, potentially
   matching vulnerabilities discovered by the host-based scanner with
   attacks against that vulnerability discovered by the network scanner.

   In step 2, another host-based scanner (e.g., an asset inventory tool)
   reports data using both a synthetic identifier in its own namespace
   and a synthetic identifier in the first host-based tool's namespace.
   This other identifier may have been collected on the system or may
   have been discovered some other way; how that collection happens is
   out of scope of this specification.  By passing both identifiers,
   however, the scanner provides enough data to the asset database to
   correlate the additional inventory data with the vulnerability and
   event data.  Additionally, any other data reported using either the
   IP address or the two synthetic identifiers will be able to be
   correlated as well.  Note that this specification does not require or
   recommend that tools process identifiers in certain ways: for
   example, an IP address may become stale after a period of time, but
   it is out of scope for this specification to recommend how to deal
   with that.

   In step 3, the asset database provides a report to a higher-level
   database.  Depending on the reporting architecture, organizational
   hierarchy, and reporting requirements, asset databases may want to
   report on data with different sets of synthetic identifiers for each
   asset.  This specification does not restrict or recommend
   architectures or workflows.

   In the reporting architecture shown above, all known asset
   identifiers for each asset are being used to report information to
   the higher level.  In this architecture, data provided by other tools
   to the higher-level database may be correlated with the reported
   data.  Other options would be to only report some information to the
   higher-level database or even to generate a new synthetic identifier
   to perform reporting, depending on the reporting requirements and
   network architectures.

6.  Data Model

   This section documents the data model for Asset Identification.  The
   XML schema that implements this data model is provided separate from
   this specification.

   The Asset Identification model is a fairly flat model that defines
   the constructs to hold identifying information about an asset.  A
   limited number of asset types are defined for which model constructs
   exist.  In order to use the Asset Identification model:

   o  The user SHOULD produce an XML ai:assets or ai:asset-related
      element consistent with the data model described in
      Section 6.3.12.1.

   o  The XML element produced MUST validate against the XML schema
      (XSD) for Asset Identification in Section 7.  In situations where
      the XML schema does not match the documented model in this
      specification, the XSD takes precedence.

   The following subsections formalize the logical data model.  The data
   contained in the subsections include prose and tables, which MUST be
   interpreted as follows:

   o  The subsection title indicates the name for the entity being
      described.

   o  The "INHERITS" field indicates that the element takes on all of
      the properties of the inherited element in addition to the
      properties defined for the element.

   o  The "DEFINITION" field indicates the prose description of the
      text.  The field MAY contain requirement words as indicated in
      [RFC2119].

   o  The "Properties" field is broken into a four column table:

      *  The "Name" column indicates the name of a property that MAY or
         MUST be included in the described element in accordance with
         the cardinality indicated in the "Count" field.

      *  The "Type" column indicates the type of data that MUST be the
         value for the property.  There are two categories of types:
         literal and element.  A literal type will indicate the type of
         literal.  The element type will reference the name of another
         element that defines the content for that property.

Internet-Draft          SACM Asset Identification         September 2012


      *  The "Count" column indicates the cardinality of the property
         within the element.  The property MUST be included in the
         element in accordance with the cardinality.  If a range is
         given, and "n" is the upper-bound of the range, then the upper
         limit is unbounded.

      *  The "Definition" column defines the property in the context of
         the element.  The field MAY contain requirement words as
         indicated in [RFC2119].

   Each literal data element MAY have a "source" attribute associated
   with it.  The source attribute is intended to capture the source of
   the information for that data element.  The field SHALL be a string
   type, but the value of the field is left to the content producer.
   The value MAY include, but is not restricted to, a synthetic ID of
   the asset that sourced the information, another ID of the source, or
   a description of the source.  See the XSD for additional clarity on
   the "source" attribute.

   Each literal data element MAY have a "timestamp" attribute associated
   with it.  If populated, the timestamp attribute indicates when the
   data was last known to be correct for that element.

6.1.  Abstract Elements

6.1.1.  ai:asset

   INHERITS:  None.

   DEFINITION:  The root element from which all other asset elements
         derive.  This element does not represent any specific type of
         asset, and therefore should only be used as a base class for
         other, concrete, asset elements.  Any element that claims to be
         an asset element compliant with this specification SHALL
         directly or indirectly inherit all of the attributes in this
         element.  The asset element SHALL NOT be used directly in an
         asset identification instance because it is abstract.

6.3.12.  Relating Assets to Other Assets

   While the assets modeled in Section 6.2, and their related elements,
   capture the literal values helpful for identifying the respective
   assets, it is often useful or necessary to define one or more
   relationships between assets.  Those relationships can give
   additional context to the identifying algorithm in the implementing
   tool.

   The Asset Identification data model allows for explicit relationships
   to be defined between an asset and one or more other assets.  Each
   relationship is defined as {subject} {predicate} {object}, where
   {subject} is the asset from which the relationship begins,
   {predicate} is the relationship type being established, and {object}
   is one or more other assets.  The predicate MUST be a qualified name
   that refers to a term in a controlled vocabulary.  Section 6.4.1
   documents the data model to represent assets along with
   relationships.  Section 6.4.2 defines terms in a controlled
   vocabulary for Asset Identification.

6.3.12.1.  Relationship Data Model

   Asset Identification defines two elements that can be leveraged by
   specifications desiring to represent Asset Identification
   information.  The first element, ai:asset-related, SHOULD be
   leveraged when the implementing specification desires to identify a
   single asset while demonstrating relationships between that asset and
   other assets.  The second element, ai:assets, SHOULD be leveraged
   when the implementing specification desires to identify multiple
   assets while documenting the relationships between those assets and
   other assets.  The two elements are documented in the following
   tables.

   |         | -       |     | of this relationship by specifying the  |
   |         | NCName  |     | ID of the asset.  Depending on the type |
   |         |         |     | of relationship being asserted, there   |
   |         |         |     | may be additional restrictions on which |
   |         |         |     | types of objects may be referenced, but |
   |         |         |     | that will be documented with the        |

   | type    | literal | 1   | &#65532; This element contains the type |
   |         | - QName |     | of relationship that is being           |
   |         |         |     | specified.  The QName MUST refer to a   |
   |         |         |     | term in a controlled vocabulary.  The   |
   |         |         |     | controlled vocabulary is identified by  |
   |         |         |     | the namespace URI of the QName, and the |
   |         |         |     | term in that controlled vocabulary is   |
   |         |         |     | specified by the local name of the      |
   |         |         |     | QName.  It is helpful, though not       |
   |         |         |     | required, that when the namespace URI   |
   |         |         |     | and local name are concatenated, the    |
   |         |         |     | resulting URI is dereferenceable and    |
   |         |         |     | points to a location that defines the   |
   |         |         |     | term.                                   |
   |         |         |     |                                         |

   |         |         |     | string "inclusive" or "exclusive".      |

   |         |         |     | default value is "inclusive".  When     |

                  Table 28: core:relationship Properties

6.3.12.2.  Relationship Types

   Defined below are terms in a controlled vocabulary for Asset
   Identification.  It is OPTIONAL that content producers use the terms
   defined below, but all Asset Identification compliant implementations
   MUST understand the terms defined in this section.  Content producers
   SHOULD use these terms when possible.

   All terms listed in Table 29 exist in the controlled vocabulary
   identified by
   http://scap.nist.gov/specifications/ai/vocabulary/relationships/1.0#.
   The definition of each term can also be found at the URL created when
   concatenating the URL and the term together.  The table MUST be
   interpreted as follows:

   o  The "Term" column indicates the local-name of the term being
      identified.

   o  The "Domain" column indicates the exhaustive set of subject types
      that may be referenced by a relationship of that type.  A
      relationship of that type MUST reference a subject of the type
      indicated in "Domain" for that relationship.

   o  The "Range" column indicates the exhaustive set of object types
      that may be referenced by a relationship of that type.  A
      relationship of that type MUST reference an object of the type
      indicated in "Range" for that relationship.

   o  The "Description" column contains a prose description of the
      relationship type.  This column may contain requirement words as
      indicated in [RFC 2119].  Those requirement words MUST be
      interpreted as described in [RFC 2119] for the relationship.

     Table 29: Controlled Vocabulary Defined for Asset Identification

   Content producers that choose to use terms that are not listed in
   Table 6-29, or to use other terms in addition to those listed in
   Table 6-29, MAY do so while still remaining compliant to this
   specification.  Content producers SHALL always use terms defined in a
   controlled vocabulary.  The controlled vocabulary SHALL be identified
   using a URI.  Concatenating the controlled vocabulary URI with a term
   in the vocabulary MAY create a dereferencable URI that points to a
   definition for that term.  This is often accomplished by using an
   HTTP URL for the controlled vocabulary URI, and ending that URL in

6.3.13.  Guidance for Incorporating Asset Identification Elements into
         Other Data Models

   The following guidance applies when incorporating the Asset
   Identification data model into other data models.

   o  If the target data model needs to include a list of assets and the
      associated relationships between the assets, then the ai:assets
      element SHOULD be included in the target data model.  This will be
      the case when the target data model will make explicit references
      to assets in the asset list.

   o  If the target data model needs to include a single asset, but
      other assets are needed to help identify that asset, then the ai:
      asset-related element SHOULD be included in the target data model.
      The @asset-ref attribute on ai:asset-related SHALL refer to the
      specific asset that is being identified.

   o  If the target data model needs to include only a single asset, and
      no relationships are needed to identify that asset, then the
      element defining the asset MAY be included in the target data
      model.  While this is allowed, it is preferred that the ai:asset-
      related element be included instead.

9.  Security Considerations

   As a data format, Asset Identification does not intrinsically have
   any real security concerns - at least none are known at this time.
   However, as a data format designed to be stored and transmitted
   between entities within an enterprise, the fact of the matter is that
   it SHOULD be used within a properly secured environment.  Over time,
   a significant amount of information valuable to attackers can be
   gleaned from Asset Identification information (i.e. derived topology,
   asset purpose and criticality, to name just two).  Therefore, it is
   recommended that use of Asset Identification expressions be performed
   in environments providing communication security mechanisms supplying
   the properties of confidentiality, data integrity, and non-
   repudiation.  For example, transmission over a properly configured
   TLS connection would be better than being sent in the clear with no
   protection.

Appendix B.  Use Cases

   The following use cases describe some common asset management
   processes that rely on the ability to uniquely identify assets.  The
   asset identification specification was developed primarily in order
   to support these use cases, although the specification may be useful
   for other processes or uses.

B.1.  Correlation of Sensed Data

   Sensor data is not limited to an automated process: user surveys,
   manually entered information, and other data may also be correlated
   using this Asset Identification specification.  The data must be
   correlated both with other manually collected data and with data
   collected by automated sensors, in order to build a complete
   representation of all known data about an asset.

   Consistent asset identification allows data to be correlated
   regardless of:

   o  Collection timeframe

   o  Data type (vulnerability scan vs. user survey)

   o  Manual or automated process

   o  Data format

   In this case, the goal of asset identification is to provide as much
   identifying information as possible about an asset in order to ensure
   the greatest probability of matching asset data from several
   different sources.  Constraining which data is provided merely
   reduces the possibility of a match.

B.2.  Federation of Asset Databases

   While many smaller organizations may only have a single asset
   database, larger organizations with many asset databases may wish to
   share information about assets among them.  This includes:

   o  Peer to peer relationships, where asset data is replicated and
      fused between several asset databases

   o  Hierarchical relationships, where an asset database is aggregated
      from several lower-level databases into fewer higher-level
      databases

   In both use cases, asset identification facilitates detection of

   duplicate asset representations, correlation of asset data across the
   databases, and direct queries for asset data among tools.

   In this use case, asset databases may wish to use a smaller set of
   data, or even a single identifier, in order to properly federate the
   asset data.  For example, use of the motherboard GUID or single
   synthetic ID, such as an asset tag, may be sufficient to allow asset
   databases to exchange information about assets.

B.3.  Directly Targeted Remediation Actions

   While assessment and sensor data may be collected from all assets in
   a particular organization environment without specifically
   identifying a particular asset identifier, remediation actions
   require a more granular identification process that directly targets
   the asset using identification data.  This ensures that unintended
   side effects are avoided and the intended remediation action is able
   to be completed successfully.

   A single agent identifier or motherboard GUID allows those triggering
   remediation actions to specify exactly which assets should have the
   remediation applied and allows the tools to unambiguously identify
   those assets in the remediation control language.

B.4.  Management of Asset Data

   Outside of the collection of sensor data and federation of asset
   databases, asset data may be used in a variety of management
   processes.  This includes both further processing of asset data, such
   as aggregation for the purposes of metrics collection, and display to
   an end user.  Both of these uses require asset identification be
   present to ensure all systems are able to accurately represent the
   correct assets.  For purposes of aggregation, for example, asset
   identification may be used to request detailed data about outliers
   from the sensors that collected the data.

Appendix C.  Extending the Asset Identification Specification

   Although the core Asset Identification specification should satisfy
   most users, some organizations may find that there are weaknesses or
   missing elements in the specification.  In these cases, the
   organization may extend the Asset Identification specification by
   extending the XML schema that defines the data model.  These
   extensions should be published as an XML schema to ensure that both
   schema extensions and instance documents are valid.

C.1.  Additional Asset Types

   Some organizations may wish to identify assets that are not contained
   in the valid asset list as defined in Section 5.3.  To do this,
   additional XML elements can be defined that extend (using the XSD
   extension mechanism) an appropriate asset type (best practices entail
   using the most specific asset type that captures the necessary
   elements).  Additional identification fields can be defined in the
   schema and additional relationships can be defined by creating new
   relationship types in a non-core controlled vocabulary.

C.2.  Additional Literal Identifiers for Existing Asset Types

   Additional literal identifiers for existing asset types may be added
   by creating schema elements in the extended-information element.
   Although there is no technical restriction of these fields to literal
   identifiers (i.e. information that is used to identify the asset),
   placing information in an asset element that does not help identify
   the asset is counter to the purpose of this specification.

C.3.  Additional Relationships

   Organizations may also wish to identify existing or new asset types
   using relationships that are not defined in the core specification.
   This may be accomplished by defining and publishing a relationship
   vocabulary in a separate namespace than the core Asset Identification
   relationship vocabulary.

C.4.  Additional Properties on Existing Data Elements

   The XML schema also provides extension points on most XML elements to
   allow for tracking metadata about Asset Identification information,
   such as classification level, sensitivity, or other organization-
   specific data.  As long as Asset Identification elements are able to
   validate against the core schema and conform to the requirements of
   this specification, these extensions and the Asset Identification
   elements are valid.
