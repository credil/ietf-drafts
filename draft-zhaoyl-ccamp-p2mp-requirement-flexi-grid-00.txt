        Requirements for Supporting P2MP in Flexi-Grid Networks
           draft-zhaoyl-ccamp-p2mp-requirement-flexi-grid-00

Abstract

   Multicasting over WDM optical networks has enabled many popular
   Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) applications, such as video conference,
   interactive distance learning, replicated database, distributed
   computing, and so on.  However, the low-rate multicasting traffic
   demands cannot make full use of the capacity of the entire wavelength
   .  Flexi-grid network overcomes the fixed grid constraint of
   Wavelength Switched Optical Network (WSON) by flexible spectrum
   allocation based on the demand of the client request.  It is an
   effective solution to address the problem of inefficient spectrum
   utilization.  Therefore, it is essential to exploit multicasting over
   flexi-grid networks.  This document covers the requirements for
   supporting P2MP over flexi-grid infrastructure.  Specifically, the
   scope of requirements listed in this document covers the
   functionality that should be supported by the control plane.

2.  Introduction

   Multicasting over WDM optical networks has enabled many popular
   Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) applications, such as video conference,
   interactive distance learning, replicated database, distributed
   computing, and so on.  RFC [4461] presents a set of requirements for
   the establishment and maintenance of P2MP Traffic-Engineered (TE)
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  The requirements not only apply to
   packet-switched networks under the control of MPLS protocols, but
   also encompass the requirements of Layer Two Switching (L2SC), Time
   Division Multiplexing (TDM), lambda, and port switching networks
   managed by GMPLS protocols.  RFC [4875] describes extensions to
   Resource reSerVation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for the
   setup of Traffic Engineered (TE) based P2MP Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs) in MPLS and GMPLS networks.  However, the low-rate
   multicasting traffic demands cannot make full use of the capacity of
   the entire wavelength .  Therefore in order to increase the network
   spectrum efficiency, it is essential to exploit multicasting over
   flexi-grid networks.

   Flexible grid technology is defined in the latest version of ITU-T
   G.694.1, which is also a dense wavelength division multiplexing and
   different from traditional fixed grid technology.  Compared to fixed
   grids, flexible grid has a smaller and agile granularity for the
   central frequencies and the slot width may range from 12.5GHz to
   hundreds of GHz.  The flexible grid technology allows mixed bit rates
   or mixed modulation formats transmission system to allocate frequency
   slots with different slot widths.  So that they can be optimized for
   the bandwidth requirements of a particular bit rate and modulation
   scheme of the individual channels.  In the dynamic flexi-grid
   networks, not only an appropriate route is necessary to be selected
   for the client LSP, but also the appropriate width of spectrum slot
   is needed for the client LSP.  The spectrum slot here is made up of
   several consecutive spectrum slots from end-to-end, and is determined
   by the data rate and the modulation level.

   There are several drafts addressing the extensions of GMPLS protocols
   to support the flexi-grid networks.
   [draft-farrkingel-ccamp-flexigrid-lambda-label] updates the
   definition of GMPLS lambda labels to support the flexi-grid, and
   [draft-hussain-ccamp-super-channel-label] defines a super-channel

   label as a Super-Channel Identifier and an associated list of 12.5
   GHz slices representing the optical spectrum of the super-channel.
   This label format can be used in GMPLS signaling and routing protocol
   to establish super-channel based optical label switched paths.  In
   addition, [draft-wang-ccamp-gmpls-glexigrid-framework] provides a
   framework for applying Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching
   (GMPLS) and the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture to
   control the flexible grid network base on the Wavelength Switched
   Optical Networks (WSONs), and [draft-ogrcetal-ccamp-flexi-
   grid-fwk-00] defines a framework and the associated control plane
   requirements for the GMPLS based control of flexi-grid DWDM networks.

   This document covers the requirements for supporting P2MP over flexi-
   grid infrastructure.  First, section 3 provides some definitions
   including background terminology and acronym list.  Then, section 4
   goes over a set of requirements that must be considered when defining
   the protocol extensions to support P2MP in flexi-grid networks.
   Next, the framework of extensions for supporting P2MP in flexi-grid
   networks is presented in Section 5.


3.  Definitions

3.1.  Terminologies

   Flexi-grid: a new technology allows mixed bit rates or mixed
   modulation formats transmission system to allocate frequency slots
   with different slot widths.  So they can be optimized for the
   bandwidth requirements of a particular bit rate and modulation scheme
   of the individual channels.

   Frequency Slot: a frequency slot is defined by its nominal central
   frequency and its slot width.  It denotes the frequency range
   allocated to a channel, but unavailable for any other channels.

   Spectral Slice: the minimum granularity of a frequency slot (e.g.
   12.5 GHz).

   Slot Width: the full width of a frequency slot in a flexible grid.

   Frequency Range: a frequency range is defined as the portion of
   frequency spectrum included between a lowest and a highest frequency.

   P2MP tree: the ordered set of LSRs and TE links that comprise the
   path of a P2MP TE LSP from its ingress LSR to all of its egress LSRs.

   Ingress LSR: the LSR that is responsible for initiating the signaling
   messages that set up the P2MP TE LSP.

   Egress LSR: one of potential many destinations of the P2MP TE LSP.
   Egress LSRs may also be referred to as leaf nodes or leaves.

   Branch LSR: an LSR that has more than one directly connected
   downstream LSRs.

   Source: the sender of traffic that is carried on a P2MP service
   supported by a P2MP LSP.  The sender is not necessarily the ingress
   LSR of the P2MP LSP.

   Receiver: a recipient of traffic carried on a P2MP service supported
   by a P2MP LSP.  A receiver is not necessarily an egress LSR of the
   P2MP LSP.  Zero, one, or more receivers may receiver data through a
   given egress LSR.

3.2.  Acronyms

   GMPLS: Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching

   P2MP: Point-to-Multipoint

   LSP: Label Switched Paths

   LSR: Label Switched Router

   WXC: Wavelength Cross Connect

   WSS: Wavelength Selective Switch


4.  Requirements for Supporting P2MP in Flexi-grid Networks

4.1.  Requirements description

   The broadcast-and-select mechanism at the WXC node by employing
   bandwidth-variable WSS is suitable for multicasting traffic.  This
   document covers the high level requirements for the support P2MP over
   flexi-grid infrastructure.

   [Requirement 1 ] Flexible Bandwidth of P2MP LSP

   The protocol should allow the P2MP LSP in the flexi-grid network to
   be of different sizes/bandwidths.  The number of Spectral Slices and
   the granularity of each slice could be flexible.

   [Requirement 2 ] Flexible mapping of P2MP LSP

   This means the P2MP LSP should be allowed to be mapped to any

Internet-Draft         P2MP in Flexi-Grid Networks             July 2012


   Frequency Range in the ITU grid.  Note that the Frequency Range
   allocation of P2MP LSP on the ITU-Grid shall confirm to [G.FLEXGRID].

   [Requirement 3 ] Consecutive Frequency Range of P2MP LSP

   This means that the spectral resources allocated to P2MP LSP must be
   consecutive.

   [Requirement 4 ] Flexibly choose the modulation format for P2MP LSP

   Each channel mapped to the flexi-grid system shall have the
   capability to support different modulation formats, e.g.  BPSK, QPSK,
   8PSK, 16QAM, 64QAM, and so on.

   [Requirement 5 ] Bandwidth Resizing of P2MP LSP

   Since the bandwidth of P2MP LSP depends on the modulation format of
   the signal, the protocol shall allow bandwidth resizing if the
   modulation format of optical signal changes.

   [Requirement 6 ] Bandwidth Resizing for subset of P2MP LSP

   Moreover, the extended protocol should support the functionality
   which allows a subset of the P2MP LSP bandwidth resizing, e.g.,
   changing the modulation format of optical signal.

4.2.  Examples for Requirements

   In the current optical networks, a single given modulation format,
   such as BPSK, QPSK, and most recently n-QAM is employed.  In P2MP
   scenario, there may be more than one destination LSR, and each
   destination LSR has a different path length.  The design of the
   system ensures that the longest path can be transmitted with a
   sufficient quality of signal.  Therefore, at the transmitter of all
   destination LSRs have the highest modulation format and occupy the
   largest spectral width regardless of the different optical path
   length.  Thus, some paths shorter than the others result in
   overspending of network resources.

   However, in the flexi-grid networks, the modulation format can be
   elastically selected based on the length of the LSP.  The different
   assignment of spectral bandwidth of P2MP LSP for each destination LSR
   (including Egress LSR and branch LSR) is based on the different
   modulation format by varying the number of bits per symbol, for
   example QPSK (2 bits per symbol) for one destination LSR and 16QAM (4
   bits per symbol) for another.  Note that the increasing of modulation
   levels lies in the narrower spacing of symbols of signal
   constellation, resulting in receiver sensitivity deterioration.

          Figure 1 An example for bandwidth resizing of P2MP LSP

   There is a P2MP request from Node A to Nodes F and H, and suppose its
   bit rate is 60Gbit/s.  When we construct a P2MP tree like figure 1,
   the hops from A to F is 5, and from A to H is 6.  Suppose a LSP which
   has more than 5 hops must take QPSK modulation level for reducing the
   nonlinear transmission impairments. then, in order to ensure that the
   worst case optical path in this P2MP request, usually we take QPSK as
   the modulate level.  Here, 60 GHz spectral resources are needed.
   Since the minimum granularity of a Frequency Slot is 12.5 GHz, a
   frequency slot consisting 5 spectral slices with the Slot Width being
   62.5 GHz are used.  Note that these 5 frequency slices must be
   consecutive in the spectral domain.

   In the first scenario, link A-B has not enough spectral resources,
   e.g. only has 4 spectral slices being consecutive.  So we could
   change the modulate level if we want to route this P2MP LSP
   successfully.  Here, we change the modulation level from QPSK to
   16QAM.  That's mean only 3 spectral slices are needed here.

   In the second scenario, link A-B has not enough spectral resources,
   e.g. only has 4 spectral slices being consecutive.  Under the
   assumption that O/E/O converting is permitted at the middle nodes, we
   could cut this P2MP LSPs into three parts, one from A to D, one from
   D to F, and the third one from D to H. For the LSP from A to D, we
   take 16QAM as its modulation level; for the LSP from D to F, we take
   64 QAM as the modulation level; and for the LSP from D to H, we take
   16 QAM as the modulation level.  That's means that only 3, 2, 3
   spectral slices are needed here respectively.

5.  Framework of Protocol Extensions

   Mixed bitrate transmission systems can allocate their channels with
   different spectral bandwidths so that the channels can be optimized
   for the bandwidth requirements of the particular bit rate and
   modulation format of the individual channels.  A flexible grid
   network selects its data channels as arbitrarily assigned spectral
   slices.  It is being developed within the ITU-T Study Group 15 to
   allow the selection and switching of individual lambdas chosen
   flexibly from a detailed, fine granularity grid of wavelength with
   arbitrary spectral bandwidth [G.FLEXIGRID].  Our analysis has
   determined that there are significant problems with existing
   protocols for supporting P2MP in flexi-grid networks.  The problems
   include RSVP, OSPF, PCE, PCEP and so on.  So additional extensions
   may be needed because of new features introduced by flexible grid.
   This section addresses the framework extensions of the requirements.

5.1.  Signaling

   RFC [4875] describes extensions to Resource reSerVation Protocol-
   Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for the setup of Traffic Engineered
   (TE) P2MP Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in MPLS and GMPLS networks.
   This section outlines RSVP-TE extensions for the support of P2MP in
   flexi-grid networks.  The ingress and egress nodes of the LSP must be
   capable of indicating whether the Link-State and the modulation
   format of the LSP should be collected during the signaling procedure
   of setting up the LSP, and the endpoints of the LSP may collect the
   Link-State and modulation format information and use it for
   configuration purposes.  When the Link-State and the modulation
   format of a LSP changes, e.g., if the administrator changes the route
   of a LSP, the endpoints of the LSP need to be capable of updating the
   Link-State information and the modulation format information of the
   LSA.  During a new P2MP LSP establishment, each node along the path
   allocates the required number of spectral slices and also learns the
   other optical parameters.

5.2.  Routing

   RFC [3630] describes extensions to the OSPF protocol version 2 to
   support intra-area traffic engineering, using Opaque Link State
   Advertisements.  This section outlines OSPF-TE extensions for the
   support of P2MP in flexi-grid networks.  As for stateful PCE, the PCE
   has a TED plus an LSP-DB which are the active LSPs state (e.g. the
   route and the slot used by a working LSP).  So no extensions needed
   here; As for stateless PCE, the TED may be filled through OSPF-TE,
   thus OSPF-TE extensions may be required to carry used frequency slot
   information, such as the associated bit-rate and modulation format.

Internet-Draft         P2MP in Flexi-Grid Networks             July 2012


5.3.  PCE

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) defined in [RFC4655] provides path
   computation functions in support of traffic engineering in GMPLS
   networks.  It is an entity that is capable of computing a network
   path or route based on a network graph and of applying computational
   constraints.  [RFC4655] also defines various deployment models that
   place PCEs differently within the network.  The PCEs may be
   collocated with the Label Switching Routers (LSRs), may be part of
   the management system that requests the LSPs to be established, or
   may be positioned as one or more computation servers within the
   network.

   This part examines the applicability of PCE to path computation for
   P2MP TE LSPs in Flexi-grid networks.  As for stateful PCE, PCE has a
   TED plus an LSP-DB which are the active LSPs state; and as for
   stateless PCE, PCE exploits a TED which includes per-link information
   regarding the usage of the optical spectrum resource.  In order to
   identify the information of the route, the TED plus the LSP-DB
   exploited by the PCE should be extended to store the following
   information:

   o  Bit rate of any working LSP in the network.

   o  Modulation format of any working LSP in the network.

   o  Allocated central frequency and slot width for any active LSP in
      the network.

5.4.  PCEP

   RFC [5862] complements the general requirements and presents a
   detailed set of PCC-PCE communication protocol requirements for P2MP
   MPLS/GMPLS traffic engineering.  This part examines the applicability
   of PCEP to path computation for P2MP TE LSPs in Flexi-grid networks.
   Similar with PCE, an extension may be needed in the PCEP Path
   Computation Reply message to inform the ingress node about the
   following information along the route:

   o  Bit rate of any working LSP in the network.

   o  Modulation format of any working LSP in the network.

   o  Allocated central frequency and slot width for any active LSP in
      the network.
