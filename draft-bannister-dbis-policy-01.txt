Internet Draft           DBIS Password Policies        September 9, 2013


Abstract          

   This document extends Directory-Based Information Services (DBIS)
   described in [draft-bannister-dbis-mapping-00] to support the shadow
   databases.

   The shadow database schema SHALL be backwards compatible with the
   Network Information Service [NIS] but stored within [X.500] entries
   so that it may be resolved with the Lightweight Directory Access
   Protocol [RFC4510].

   A shadow database extends user login accounts with credential policy
   data.

   This document represents shadow database entries as an extended set
   of attributes that may be applied to both passwd and group database
   entries for the management of consistent password policies.

   This document describes configuration maps [draft-bannister-dbis-
   mapping-00] for shadow databases, and database entries referenced by
   those maps.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED" and "MAY" in this document are
   to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1. Database

1.1. passwd

1.1.1. Definition

   DBIS shadow database entries are defined in attributes that are added
   to a posixUserAccount or posixGroupAccount object [draft-bannister-
   dbis-passwd-00] by assigning the posixPwdPolicy auxiliary class. 
   Configuration maps [draft-bannister-dbis-mapping-00] are not required
   for shadow database entries.

   A DBIS passwd entry may also contain the fields from the shadow
   database:

   - Date when password was last modified.

   - Minimum number of days required between password changes, or -1 to
     disable password aging.

   - Maximum number of days the password is valid, or -1 to disable
     password aging.

   - Number of days before password expires that user is warned, or -1
     to disable password aging.

   - Number of days of inactivity permitted before account is locked.

   - Date when user account expires.

   - Failed login count.

   The shadow database represents dates as the number of days since 1
   January 1970.  The DBIS schema represents dates in generalizedTime

   format [RFC4517].  The DUA SHALL translate between the two formats to
   maintain backwards compatibility with NIS.

   DBIS also adds the following information:

   - Number of days grace allowed for user to change their password
     after it has reached its maximum age and before the account is
     locked.

   - Date when user account was last used.

   The information that makes up a database entry is obtained from the
   attributes described in the following sections.

   It is RECOMMENDED that password policies are managed using native
   features in the LDAP Directory Server if available, or using
   Pluggable Authentication Modules [PAM] to provide consistency of
   security and centralised administration.  Whether or not the shadow
   attributes are used by the policy will vary between implementations.

1.1.2. Object Classes

1.1.2.1. Introduction

   A passwd entry MAY have the posixPwdPolicy class assigned if password
   policies are to be managed using these attributes. A DUA SHALL
   support password policies on passwd accounts via this class.

1.1.2.2. dbisShadowCompat

   For compatibility, the pwdLastChange and pwdExpire attributes
   described in this document that take dates in Generalized Time format
   (1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.24) may alternatively be remapped with
   dbisMapAttr to attributes that use Integer format instead
   (1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27).

   This is intended to support existing configurations only and SHOULD
   NOT be used for new entries, which should use Generalized Time. A DUA
   MUST support both formats.

   The dbisShadowCompat class MAY be associated with a dbisPasswdConfig
   entry to enable this compatibility setting, and is defined as
   follows:

       objectclass ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.23780.219.1.36 NAME 'dbisShadowCompat'
         DESC 'DBIS shadow map time format compatibility'
         SUP top ABSTRACT )

Internet Draft           DBIS Password Policies        September 9, 2013


         This only applies to pwdLastChange and pwdExpire.  It does not
         affect the pwdLastUsed attribute.

1.1.2.3. posixPwdPolicy

         The posixPwdPolicy class is defined as follows:

       objectclass ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.23780.219.1.10 NAME 'posixPwdPolicy'
         DESC 'POSIX-style password policy attributes'
         SUP top AUXILIARY
         MAY ( pwdLastChange $ pwdAgeMin $ pwdAgeMax $ pwdAgeWarning $
               pwdAgeGrace $ pwdLastUsed $ pwdInactivity $
               pwdExpire $ pwdFailCount $ pwdTimeInteger ) )

1.1.3. Attributes

1.1.3.1. pwdLastChange

   The date identifying when the account's password was last modified is
   stored in the shadowLastChange attribute that MAY be assigned to a
   posixPwdPolicy entry:

       attributetype ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.23780.219.2.17 NAME 'pwdLastChange'
         DESC 'Date when password last changed'
         EQUALITY generalizedTimeMatch
         ORDERING generalizedTimeOrderingMatch
         SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.24 SINGLE-VALUE )

   If it exists, this attribute SHALL be updated by the DUA whenever the
   account's password is changed.

   If the attribute is missing, it must be assumed that the password has
   never been changed.  For the purposes of password aging, the password
   will be considered to have reached its maximum age.

1.1.3.2. pwdAgeMin

   The minimum number of days between password changes is stored in the
   pwdAgeMin attribute that MAY be assigned to a posixPwdPolicy entry:

       attributetype ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.23780.219.2.18 NAME 'pwdAgeMin'
         DESC 'Minimum number of days between password changes'
         EQUALITY integerMatch
         ORDERING integerOrderingMatch
         SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27 SINGLE-VALUE )

   The DUA SHALL NOT permit the password to be changed unless the
   pwdLastChange attribute indicates that the present password is at

   least as old as indicated by pwdAgeMin.

   If the attribute is missing or set to -1, the password aging policy
   is disabled.  If set to 0, passwords have no minimum age.

1.1.3.3. pwdAgeMax

   The maximum number of days a password is valid is stored in the
   pwdAgeMax attribute that MAY be assigned to a posixPwdPolicy entry:

       attributetype ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.23780.219.2.19 NAME 'pwdAgeMax'
         DESC 'Maximum number of days a password is valid'
         EQUALITY integerMatch
         ORDERING integerOrderingMatch
         SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27 SINGLE-VALUE )

   The DUA SHOULD prompt the account owner to change their password if
   it has reached the maximum age configured in the password policy and
   is not older than the sum of pwdAgeMax and pwdAgeGrace, except when
   there is no interactive process available to obtain input.  The DUA
   SHALL NOT successfully authenticate an account under these conditions
   unless it has been able to prompt the owner to supply their old and
   new passwords and the pwdLastChange attribute has been updated.

   If the password is older than the sum of pwdAgeMax and pwdAgeGrace,
   then the DUA SHALL NOT prompt the owner to change their password and
   MUST lock the account by deleting all authPassword attributes
   associated with the account.

   If the attribute is missing or set to -1, the password aging policy
   is disabled.  If set to 0, the password must be changed on every use.

1.1.3.4. pwdAgeWarning

   The number of days before a password expires that the user is warned
   is stored in the pwdAgeWarning attribute that MAY be assigned to a
   posixPwdPolicy entry:

       attributetype ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.23780.219.2.20 NAME 'pwdAgeWarning'
         DESC 'Number of days prior to password expiry a user is warned'
         EQUALITY integerMatch
         ORDERING integerOrderingMatch
         SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27 SINGLE-VALUE )

   If this attribute is set, the DSA SHALL examine the pwdAgeMax and
   pwdExpire attributes and warn the user when the password is due to
   expire, except when there is no method available for communicating
   with the user.  The DSA MAY also warn the user after pwdAgeMax has

   been reached but before the end of the grace period defined in
   pwdAgeGrace.  In this context "DSA" MAY represent a separate agent
   running on the DSA or on another system elected to issue password age
   warnings.

   If the attribute is missing or set to -1, warnings are disabled.  If
   set to 0, a password expiration warning is issued each time the
   password is used.

1.1.3.5. pwdAgeGrace

   The number of days grace allowed for the account owner to change
   their password after it has reached its maximum age and before the
   account is locked is stored in the pwdAgeGrace attribute that MAY be
   assigned to a posixPwdPolicy entry:

       attributetype ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.23780.219.2.21 NAME 'pwdAgeGrace'
         DESC 'Days allowed to change password after max age reached'

         ORDERING integerOrderingMatch
         SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27 SINGLE-VALUE )

   If this attribute is set, the DUA SHALL modify its behaviour when
   password maximum age has been reached or exceeded.  This modified
   behaviour is discussed in section 1.1.3.1.

   If the attribute is missing or set to -1, the grace period is
   disabled.

1.1.3.6. pwdLastUsed

   The date when the account was last used is stored in the
   'pwdLastUsed' attribute that MAY be assigned to a posixPwdPolicy
   entry:

       attributetype ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.23780.219.2.22 NAME 'pwdLastUsed'
         DESC 'Date when account was last used'

         ORDERING generalizedTimeOrderingMatch
         SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.24 SINGLE-VALUE )

   If this attribute exists, the DUA SHALL update it upon successfully
   authenticating an account.  Note that this attribute will only track
   when an account is authenticated, and will not provide information on
   accounts used by long-running system processes.

   If this attribute is missing then account lock-out due to inactivity
   will be disabled.

1.1.3.7. pwdInactivity

   The number of days of inactivity permitted before the account is
   locked is stored in the 'pwdInactivity' attribute that MAY be
   assigned to a posixPwdPolicy entry:

       attributetype ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.23780.219.2.23 NAME 'pwdInactivity'

         ORDERING integerOrderingMatch
         SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27 SINGLE-VALUE )

   If this attribute exists, the DUA SHALL verify when the account is
   authenticated that the date stored in the pwdLastUsed attribute is no
   older than the number of days stored in this attribute.  If it is
   then the authentication SHALL NOT succeed.

   If this attribute is missing or set to -1 then account lock-out due
   to inactivity will be disabled.

1.1.3.8. pwdExpire

   The date when the account expires is stored in the 'pwdExpire'
   attribute that MAY be assigned to a posixPwdPolicy entry:

       attributetype ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.23780.219.2.24 NAME 'pwdExpire'
         DESC 'Date when account expires'
         EQUALITY generalizedTimeMatch
         ORDERING generalizedTimeOrderingMatch
         SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.24 SINGLE-VALUE )

   If this attribute exists, the DUA SHALL verify when the account is
   authenticated that today's date is earlier than the date stored in
   this attribute.  If it is not, then the authentication SHALL NOT
   succeed.

   If this attribute is missing then password expiry is disabled.

1.1.3.9. pwdFailCount

   The number of failed authentication attempts is stored in the
   'pwdFailCount' attribute that MAY be assigned to a posixPwdPolicy
   entry:

       attributetype ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.23780.219.2.25 NAME 'pwdFailCount'
         DESC 'Number of password failures'

   The DUA SHALL increment this attribute for each failed login attempt
   if the attribute exists and is greater than -1.

   If this attribute is missing or set to -1 then no password failure
   count is maintained.

   Note that this is the total number of password failures since the
   account was created and is not reset upon successful authentication.

   DBIS permits the posixPwdPolicy class to be assigned to a group entry
   bringing with it a superset of fields traditionally stored in the

   shadow database.  This allows the same password policies to be
   applied to group accounts as user accounts.  Password policies SHOULD
   be used if group accounts are given passwords.

   It is RECOMMENDED that password policies are managed using native
   features in the LDAP Directory Server if available, or using
   Pluggable Authentication Modules [PAM] to provide consistency of
   security and centralised administration.  Whether or not the shadow
   attributes are used by the policy will vary between implementations.

1.2.2. Object Classes

   A group entry MAY have the posixPwdPolicy class assigned if password
   policies are to be managed using these attributes. A DUA SHALL
   support password policies on group accounts via this class.

1.2.3. Attributes

   Password policies can be applied to group account passwords.  When
   the posixPwdPolicy class is associated with a group database entry
   then the attributes from that class may be added to the group
   account. The meaning of these attributes when associated with a
   posixGroupAccount entry is as described in section 1.1.3 of this
   document, except that they apply to group accounts instead of user
   accounts.

1.2.4. Example Group Entry

   The following is an example of a posixGroupAccount and posixPwdPolicy
   entry in LDIF format [RFC2849]:

       dn: en=finance,ou=group,ou=sales,o=infra
       objectClass: top
       objectClass: posixGroupAccount
       objectClass: posixPwdPolicy
       en: finance
       gidNumber: 152
       exactUser: mark
       exactUser: julie
       exactUser: stephen
       exactUser: nathan
       pwdLastChange: 201306100735Z
       pwdAgeMin: 1
       pwdAgeMax: 90
       pwdAgeWarning: 5
       pwdAgeGrace: 3
       pwdLastUsed: 201306170714Z
       pwdInactivity: 90

3. Implementation Notes

3.1. NIS Compatible Field Mapping

3.1.1. Introduction

   All fields that are required to generate NIS-compatible colon-
   separated shadow database formats exist in this schema and can be
   mapped to attribute types using common ABNF productions described in
   [draft-bannister-dbis-netgroup-00], section 1.2.

   The NIS-compatible shadow database fields are mapped as follows:

         user     = en
         password = authPassword   ; implementation-specific, see below
         lastchg  = pwdLastChange  ; date conversion required, see below
         min      = pwdAgeMin
         max      = pwdAgeMax
         warn     = pwdAgeWarning
         inactive = pwdInactivity
         expire   = pwdExpire      ; date conversion required, see below
         flag     = pwdFailCount   ; low 4-bits only, see below

         shadow-entry = user COLON password COLON lastchg COLON
                            min COLON max COLON warn COLON
                            inactive COLON expire COLON flag

   In the shadow mappings above:

   - password is implementation-specific.  See notes for password field
     in [draft-bannister-dbis-passwd-00] section 5.1.2.

   - lastchg and expire date formats do not match the format required in
     a NIS-compatible entry, but rather use an LDAP-specific standard.
     When producing a colon-separated shadow database entry, the DUA
     SHALL convert the date to the number of days since 1 January 1970.

Internet Draft           DBIS Password Policies        September 9, 2013


     This conversion will not be necessary if the dbisShadowCompat class
     is assigned to the dbisPasswdConfig entry, see section 1.1.2.2.

   - flag has the password failure count in the lowest four bits, while
     NIS reserves the remaining bits for future use.  Therefore, if
     pwdFailCount is greater than 15, the DUA SHALL return 15 in the
     flag field.

   - pwdAgeGrace and pwdLastUsed have no corresponding NIS fields.  The
     DUA SHALL provide an alternative means for a user to query the
     values of these fields.

     The posixPwdPolicy attributes when assigned to group database
     entries have no corresponding NIS fields.  The DUA SHALL provide an
     alternative means for a user to query the values of these fields.

4. Security Considerations

   The security considerations discussed in [draft-bannister-dbis-
   passwd-00] apply equally to this document.
