This document describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard
(AES) Cipher Algorithm in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Mode, with an
explicit Initialization Vector (IV), as a confidentiality mechanism
within the context of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP). 

This document is a product of the IP Security Working Group of the
IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
