               RTCP Extension for Third-party Loss Report
             draft-ietf-avtcore-feedback-supression-rtp-13

Abstract

   In a large RTP session using the RTCP feedback mechanism defined in
   RFC 4585, a feedback target may experience transient overload if some
   event causes a large number of receivers to send feedback at once.
   This overload is usually avoided by ensuring that feedback reports
   are forwarded to all receivers, allowing them to avoid sending
   duplicate feedback reports.  However, there are cases where it is not
   recommended to forward feedback reports, and this may allow feedback
   implosion.  This memo discusses these cases and defines a new RTCP
   third-party loss report that can be used to inform receivers that the
   feedback target is aware of some loss event, allowing them to
   suppress feedback.  Associated SDP signalling is also defined.

Internet-Draft           Third Party Loss Report           February 2012


1.  Introduction

   RTCP feedback messages [RFC4585] allow the receivers in an RTP
   session to report events and ask for action from the media source (or
   a delegated feedback target when using unicast RTCP feedback with SSM
   [RFC5760]).  There are cases where multiple receivers may initiate
   the same, or an equivalent message towards the same media source or
   the same feedback target.  When the receiver count is large, this
   behavior may cause transient overload of the media source, the
   network or both.  This is known as a "feedback storm" or a "NACK
   storm".  One common cause of such a feedback storm is receivers
   utilizing RTP retransmission [RFC4588] as a packet loss recovery
   technique, sending feedback using RTCP NACK messages [RFC4585]
   without proper dithering of the retransmission requests (e.g., not
   implementing the RFC 4585 dithering rules or sending NACKs to a
   feedback target that doesn't redistribute them to other receivers).

   Another use case involves video Fast Update requests.  A storm of
   these feedback messages can occur in conversational multimedia
   scenarios like multipoint video switching conference [RFC4587].  In
   this scenario, the receiver may lose synchronization with the video
   stream when speaker is changed in the middle of session.  Poorly
   designed receivers that blindly issue fast update requests (i.e.,
   Full Intra Request (FIR) described in RFC5104 [RFC5104]), can cause
   an implosion of FIR requests from receivers to the same media source.

   RTCP feedback storms may cause short term overload, and in extreme
   cases to pose a possible risk of increasing network congestion on the
   control channel (e.g.  RTCP feedback), the data channel, or both.  It
   is therefore desirable to provide a way of suppressing unneeded
   feedback.  This document specifies a new third-party loss report for
   this function.  It supplements the existing the use of RTCP NACK
   packet and further is more precise in the uses where the network is
   active to suppress feedback.  It tells receivers explicitly that
   feedback for a particular packet or frame loss is not needed for a
   period of time and can provide an early indication before the
   receiver reacts to the loss and invokes its packet loss repair
   machinery.  Section 6 provides some examples of when to send the
   Third Party Loss Report message.

Internet-Draft           Third Party Loss Report           February 2012


3.  Protocol Overview

   This document extends the RTCP feedback messages defined in the
   Audio-Visual Profile with feedback (RTP/AVPF) [RFC4585] defining a
   Third Party Loss Report message.  The Third Party Loss Report message
   can be used by the intermediaries to inform the receiver that the
   sender of the Third Party Loss Report has received reports that the
   indicated packets were lost, and asks the receiver not to send
   feedback to it regarding these packets.  Intermediaries are variously
   referred to as Distribution source, Burst/Retransmission Sources
   (BRS), MCUs, RTP translator, or RTP mixers, depending on the precise
   use case described in section 6.

   RTCP Third Party Loss Report follows the similar format of message
   type as RTCP NACK or Full Intra Request Command.  However, the Third
   Party Loss Report is defined as an indication that the sender of the
   feedback has received reports that the indicated packets were lost,
   while NACK [RFC4585] just indicates that the sender of the NACK
   observed that these packets were lost.  The Third Party Loss Report
   (TPLR) message is generated by an intermediary that may not seen the
   actual packet loss.  It is sent following the same timing rule as
   sending NACK defined in RFC4585 [RFC4585].  The TPLR feedback message
   may be sent in a regular full compound RTCP packet or in an early
   RTCP packet, as per the RTP/AVPF rules.  Intermediaries in the
   network that receive a Third Party Loss Report SHOULD NOT send their
   own additional Third Party Loss Report messages for the same packet
   sequence numbers.  They SHOULD simply forward the Third Party Loss
   Report message received from upstream direction to the receiver(s),
   additionally, they may generate their own Third Party Loss Report
   that reports a set of the losses they see, which are different from
   ones reported in the Third Party Loss report they received.  The
   Third Party Loss Report does not have the retransmission request
   [RFC4588] semantics.

   When a receiver gets a Third Party Loss Report message, it MUST
   follow the rules for NACK suppression in RFC 4585 and refrain from
   sending a feedback request (e.g., NACK or FIR) for the missing
   packets reported in the message,which is dealt with in the same way
   as receiving NACK.

   To increase the robustness to the loss of a TPLR, TPLR may be
   retransmitted.  If the additional TPLR arrives at receiver, the
   receiver SHOULD deal with the additional TPLR in the same way as
   receiving the first TPLR for the same packet and no additional
   behavior for receiver is required.

   A receiver may have sent a Feedback message according to the RTP/AVPF
   scheduling algorithm of RFC4585 [RFC4585] before receiving a Third

   Party Loss Report message, but further feedback messages for those
   sequence numbers SHOULD be suppressed for a period of time after
   receiving the TPLR.  Nodes that do not understand the Third Party
   Loss Report message will ignore it, and might therefore still send
   feedback according to the AVPF scheduling algorithm of RFC4585
   [RFC4585].  The media source or intermediate nodes cannot be certain
   that the use of a Third Party Loss Report message actually reduces
   the amount of feedback it receives.


4.  Format of RTCP Feedback Messages

   This document registers two new RTCP Feedback messages for Third
   Party Loss Report.  Applications that are employing one or more loss-
   repair methods MAY use the Third Party Loss Report together with
   their existing loss-repair methods either for every packet they
   expect to receive, or for an application-specific subset of the RTP
   packets in a session.  In other words, receivers MAY ignore Third
   Party Loss Report messages, but SHOULD react to them unless they have
   good reason to still send feedback messages despite having been
   requested to suppress them.

4.1.  Transport Layer Feedback:  Third-party Loss Report

   This Third Party Loss Report message is an extension to the RTCP
   Transport Layer Feedback Report and identified by RTCP packet type
   value PT=RTPFB and FMT=TBD.

   Within the common packet header for feedback messages (as defined in
   section 6.1 of RFC4585 [RFC4585]), the "SSRC of packet sender" field
   indicates the source of the request, and the "SSRC of media source"
   denotes the media sender of the flow for which the indicated losses
   are being suppressed.

   The FCI field MUST contain one or more entries of transport layer
   third party loss Early Indication (TLLEI).  Each entry applies to the
   same media source identified by the SSRC contained in the SSRC of
   media source field of Feedback header.  The length of the TLLEI
   feedback message MUST be set to 2+1*N, where N is the number of FCI
   entries.

   The Feedback Control Information (FCI) for TLLEI uses the similar
   format of message Types defined in the section 6.2.1 of RFC4585
   [RFC4585].  The format is shown in Figure 1.

      The PID field is used to specify a lost packet.  The PID field
      refers to the RTP sequence number of the lost packet.

   bitmask of lost packets (BLP): 16 bits

      The BLP allows for reporting losses of any of the 16 RTP packets
      immediately following the RTP packet indicated by the PID.  The
      BLP's definition is identical to that given in the section 6.2.1
      of [RFC4585].


4.2.  Payload Specific Feedback: Third-party Loss Report

   This message is an extension to the RTCP Payload Specific Feedback
   report and identified by RTCP packet type value PT=PSFB and FMT=TBD,
   which is used to suppress FIR [RFC5104] and PLI [RFC4585].

   Within the common packet header for feedback messages (as defined in
   section 6.1 of RFC4585 [RFC4585]), the "SSRC of packet sender" field
   indicates the source of the request, and the "SSRC of media source"
   is not used and SHALL be set to 0.  The SSRCs of the media senders to
   which this message applies are in the corresponding FCI entries.

   The Feedback Control Information (FCI) for a Payload Specific Third
   Party Loss Early Indication (PSLEI) consists one or more FCI entries.
   Each entry applies to a different media Source, identified by its
   SSRC. the content of which is depicted in Figure 2.  The length of
   the PSLEI feedback message MUST be set to 2+1*N, where N is the
   number of FCI entries.

   The format is shown in Figure 2.

5.  SDP Signaling

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] attribute, rtcp-fb,
   is defined in the Section 4 of RFC4585 [RFC4585] and may be used to
   negotiate the capability to handle specific AVPF commands and
   indications.  The ABNF for rtcp-fb is described in section 4.2 of
   RFC4585 [RFC4585].  In this section, we extend the rtcp-fb attribute
   to include the commands and indications that are described for third
   party loss report in the present document.

   In the ABNF [RFC5234] for rtcp-fb-val defined in RFC4585 [RFC4585],
   the feedback type "nack", without parameters, indicates use of the
   Generic NACK feedback format as defined in Section 6.2.1of RFC4585
   [RFC4585].  In this document, we define two parameters that indicate
   the third party loss supported for use with "nack", namely:

   o  "tllei" denotes support of transport layer third party loss early
      indication.

   o  "pslei" denotes support of payload specific third party loss early
      indication.

   The ABNF for these two parameters for "nack" is defined here (please
   refer to section 4.2 of RFC4585 [RFC4585] for complete ABNF syntax).

           rtcp-fb-val        =/ "nack" rtcp-fb-nack-param
           rtcp-fb-nack-param = SP "tllei"

                               / SP "pslei"
                                   ;payload specific third party
                                   ; loss early indication

                                   ; for future commands/indications
           token =     <as defined in section 9 of [RFC4566]>
           byte-string = <as defined in section 4.2 of [RFC4585] >

   and the full syntax of the "rtcp-fb" attribute.


6.  Example Use Cases

   The operation of feedback suppression is similar for all types of RTP
   sessions and topologies [RFC5117], however the exact messages used
   and the scenarios in which suppression is employed differ for various
   use cases.  The following sections outline some of the intended use
   cases for using the Third Party Loss Report for feedback suppression
   and give an overview of the particular mechanisms.

6.1.  Source Specific Multicast (SSM) use case

   In SSM RTP sessions as described in "RTP Control Protocol (RTCP)
   Extensions for Single-Source Multicast Sessions with Unicast
   Feedback" [RFC5760], one or more Media Sources send RTP packets to a
   Distribution Source.  The Distribution Source relays the RTP packets
   to the receivers using a source- specific multicast group.

   As outlined in the RFC5760 [RFC5760], there are two Unicast Feedback
   models that may be used for reporting, the Simple Feedback model and
   the Distribution Source Feedback Summary Model.  In the simple
   Feedback Model, there's no need for distribution source to create the
   Third Party Loss Report, instead, NACKs are reflected by the
   distribution source to the other Receivers.  However in the
   Distribution Source Feedback Summary model, the distribution source
   will not redistribute the NACK for some reason(e.g., to prevent
   revealing the identity or existence of a system sending NACK)and may
   send a Third Party Loss Report to the systems that were unable to
   receive the NACK, and won't receive the NACK via other means.  The
   Third Party Loss Report can be generated at the distribution source
   when downstream loss is told (e.g., downstream loss report is
   received), which indicates to the receivers that they should not
   transmit feedback messages for the same loss event for a certain
   time.  Therefore the distribution source in the feedback summary
   model can be reasonably certain that it will help the situation
   (i.e., unable receive the NACK) by sending this Third Party Loss
   Report message to all the relevant receivers impacted by the packet
   loss.

6.2.  Unicast based Rapid Acquisition of Multicast Stream (RAMS) use
      case

   The typical RAMS architecture [RFC6285] may have several Burst/
   Retransmission Sources(BRS) behind the multicast source (MS) placed
   at the same level.  These BRSes will receive the primary multicast

Internet-Draft           Third Party Loss Report           February 2012


   RTP stream from the media source and cache most recent packets after
   joining multicast session.  If packet loss happens at the upstream of
   all the BRSs or the downstream of BRSes.  One of the BRSes or all the
   BRSes may send a NACK or TPLR message to the DS, where the SSRC in
   this NACK or TPLR message is the BRS that is sending the message.
   The DS forwards/reflects this message down on the primary SSM.  The
   details on how DS deal with this message is specified in
   [RETRANSMISSION-FOR-SSM].

6.3.  RTP Transport Translator use case

   A Transport Translator (Topo-Trn-Translator), as defined in RFC5117
   [RFC5117] is typically forwarding the RTP and RTCP traffic between
   RTP clients, for example converting from multicast to unicast for
   domains that do not support multicast.  The translator may suffer a
   loss of important video packets.  In this case, the translator may
   forward TPLR message received from upstream in the same way as
   forwarding other RTCP traffic.  If the translator acting as the
   monitor [MONARCH] is aware of packet loss, it may use the SSRC of
   monitor as packet sender SSRC to create NACK message and send it to
   the receivers that is not aware of packet loss.

6.4.  Multipoint Control Unit (MCU) use case

   When the speaker is changed in a voice-activated multipoint video
   switching conference [RFC4587], an RTP mixer can be used to select
   the available input streams and forward them to each participants.
   If the MCU is doing a blind switch without waiting for a
   synchronization point on the new stream it can send a FIR to the new
   video source.  In this case the MCU should send a FIR suppression
   message to the new receivers. e.g., when the RTP Mixer starts to
   receive FIR from some participants it can suppress the remaining
   session participants from sending FIR by sending out a Third party
   Loss report message.

6.5.  Mixer use case

   A Mixer, in accordance with RFC5117 [RFC5117], aggregates multiple
   RTP streams from other session participants and generates a new RTP
   stream sent to the session participants.  In some cases, the video
   frames may get badly screwed up between media source and the mixer.
   In such case, the mixer need to check if the packet loss will result
   in PLI or FIR transmissions from most of the group by analyzing the
   received video.  If so the mixer may initiate FIR or PLI towards the
   media source on behalf of all the session participants and send out a
   Third party Loss report message to these session participants that
   may or are expected to send a PLI or FIR.  Alternatively, when the
   mixer starts to receive FIR or PLI from some participants and like to

   suppress the remaining session participants from sending FIR or PLI
   by forwarding the FIR/PLI from one session participant to others.


7.  Security Considerations

   The defined messages have certain properties that have security
   implications.  These must be addressed and taken into account by
   users of this protocol.

   Spoofed or maliciously created feedback messages of the type defined
   in this specification can have the following implications:

   Sending the spurious Third Party Loss Report (e.g., the Third Party
   Loss Report with the wrong sequence number of lost packet) that
   causes missing RTP packets to not be repaired in a timely fashion.

   To prevent these attacks, there is a need to apply authentication and
   integrity protection of the feedback messages.  This can be
   accomplished against threats external to the current RTP session
   using the RTP profile that combines Secure RTP [RFC3711] and AVPF
   into SAVPF [RFC5124].

   Note that intermediaries that are not visible at the RTP layer that
   wish to send the Third Party Loss Reports on behalf of the media
   source can only do so if they spoof the SSRC of the media source.
   This is difficult in case SRTP is in use.  If the intermediary is
   visible at the RTP layer, this is not an issue, provided the
   intermediary is part of the security context for the session.

   Also note that endpoints that receive a Third Party Loss Report would
   be well-advised to ignore it, unless the security is in place to
   authenticate the sender of the Third Party Loss Report.  Accepting
   Third Party Loss Report from un-authenticated sender can lead to a
   denial of service attack, where the endpoint accepts poor quality
   media that could be repaired.


8.  IANA Consideration

   For use with "nack" [RFC4585], a joint sub-registry has been set up
   that registers the following two values:

  The value registration for the attribute value "nack":

       Value name:     tllei
       Long name:      Transport Layer Third Party Loss Early Indication
