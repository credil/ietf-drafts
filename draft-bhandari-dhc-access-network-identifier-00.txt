Internet-Draft           DHCPv4 & v6 ANI options               July 2012


1.  Introduction

   Access network idenfication of a network device has a range of
   application.  The local mobility anchor in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain
   is able to provide access network and access operator specific
   handling or policing of the mobile node traffic using information
   about the access network to which the mobile node is attached.

   This document specifies Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol v4
   (DHCPv4) [RFC2131] and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol v6
   (DHCPv6) [RFC3315] options for access network identification that is
   added by Client or Relay agent in the DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 messages
   towards the Server.

   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) client or DHCP relay agent
   aware of the access network and access operator add this information
   in the DHCP messages.  DHCP relay agent or DHCP server in the mobile
   access gateway can pass this information towards local mobility
   anchor either via Proxy Mobile IPv6 signalling or by relaying the
   DHCP messages to DHCP entity within the local mobility anchor.


2.  Motivation

   Proxy mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] can be used for supporting network-based
   mobility management in various type of network deployments.  The
   network architectures, such as Service provider Wi-Fi access
   aggregation or, WLAN integrated mobile packet core are examples where
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 is a component of the overall architecture.  Some
   of these architectures require the ability of the local mobility
   anchor (LMA) [RFC5213] to provide differentiated services and
   policing of traffic to the mobile nodes based on the access network
   to which they are attached.  Policy systems in mobility architectures
   such as PCC [TS23203] and ANDSF [TS23402] in 3GPP system allow
   configuration of policy rules with conditions based on the access
   network information.  For example, the service treatment for the
   mobile node's traffic may be different when they are attached to a
   access network owned by the home operator than when owned by a
   roaming partner.  The service treatment can also be different based
   on the configured Service Set Identifiers (SSID) in case of IEEE
   802.11 based access networks.  Other examples of services include the
   operator's ability to apply tariff based on the location.

   The PMIPv6 extension as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-netext-access-network-option] defines PMIPv6 options to
   carry access network identifiers in PMIPv6 signalling from Mobile
   Access Gateway (MAG) to LMA.  MAG can learn this information from
   DHCP options as inserted by DHCP client or Relay agent before MAG.

Internet-Draft           DHCPv4 & v6 ANI options               July 2012


   If MAG relays DHCP messages to LMA as specified in [RFC5844] this
   information can be inserted by MAG towards LMA in the forwarded DHCP
   messages.

   Figure 1 illustrates an example Proxy Mobile IPv6 deployment where
   Acess Points (AP) inserts access network identifiers in DHCP
   messages.  The mobile access gateway learns this information over
   DHCP and delivers the information elements related to the access
   network to the local mobility anchor over Proxy Mobile IPv6 signaling
   messages.  In this example, the additional information could comprise
   the SSID of the used IEEE 802.11 network and the identities of the
   operators running the IEEE 802.11 access network infrastructure.

5.2.  Network-Identifier option

   This option can be used for carrying the name of the access network
   (e.g., a SSID in case of IEEE 802.11 Access Network, or PLMN
   Identifier [TS23003] in case of 3GPP access ), to which the client is
   attached.  There can only be a single instance of this specific sub-
   option in any OPTION_DHCPV6_ACCESS_NETWORK_ID option.  The format of
   this option is defined below.

   option-code:        16-bit code OPTION_ANI_NETWORK_ID (TBD4)
   option-length:      16-bit unsigned integer indicating length
                       in octets of this option.The value can be in the
                       range of 2 to 32 octets.

   'E'-bit:  1-bit flag for representing the encoding of the following
      name field.  MUST be set to zero (0) if the network name is
      encoded using 8-bit octets or to one (1) if the network name is
      encoded using UTF-8.

   Reserved:  7 bits MUST be set to zero when sending and ignored when
      received.

   Net-Name Length:  8-bit field for representing the length of the
      network name to be followed.

   Network Name:  The name of the access network to which the client
      is attached.  The type of the network-name is dependent on
      the Access Technology to which the mobile node is attached.  If
      its 802.11 access, the network-name is the SSID of the network.
      If the access network is 3GPP access, the network-name is the PLMN
      Identifier of the network.  If the access network is 3GPP2 access,
      the network-name is the Access Network Identifier [ANI].

      When encoding the PLMN Identifier, both MNC and MCC codes MUST be
      3 digists.  If the MNC in use only has 2 digits, then it MUST be
      preceded with a '0'.  Encoding MUST be UTF-8.

   AP-Name Length:  8-bit field for representing the length of the
      access point name to be followed.  If the access point name is not
      carried, this length should be set to zero.

   Access-Point Name:  The name of the access point (physical device
      name) to which the client is attached.  This is the
      identifier that uniquely identifies the access point.  In some
      deployments the name can be set to the mac-address of the device.
      The string is carried in UTF-8 representation.


5.3.  Operator-Identifier option

   The Operator-Identifier option can be used for carrying the operator
   identifier of the access network to which the client is attached.
   There can only be a single instance of this specific option in any
   OPTION_DHCPV6_ACCESS_NETWORK_ID option.  Its format is as follows:

    option-code:        16-bit code OPTION_ANI_OPERATOR_ID (TBD5)
    option-length:      16-bit unsigned integer indicating length
                        in octets of this option.

    Operator Identifier (Op-ID) Type:  8-bit unsigned integer indicating
       the type of the Operator Identifier.  Currently the following
       types are defined:

       0 -  Reserved.

       1 -  Vendor ID as a four octet Private Enterprise Number [SMI].

       2 -  Realm of the operator.  Realm names are required to be
          unique, and are piggybacked on the administration of the DNS
          namespace.  Realms are encoded using a domain name encoding
          defined in [RFC1035].

    Operator Identifier:  Up to 253 octets of the operator identifier.
       The encoding of the identifier depends on the used Operator-ID
       Type.  Numeric values are encoded in network byte order and
       strings have no terminating '\0' mark.




6.  Client Behavior

   All hosts or clients MAY include access network identifier options in
   all the upstream DHCP messages to inform the receiver about the
   access network it is attached to.


7.  Relay Agent Behavior

   DHCP Relay Agents MAY include these options before forwarding the
   DHCP message to provide information about the access network over
   which DHCP messages from the client is received.

Internet-Draft           DHCPv4 & v6 ANI options               July 2012


8.  Server Behavior

   If DHCP Server is unable to understand this option it MUST be
   ignored.  There is no requirement that a server return this option
   and its data in a downstream DHCP message.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines DHCPv4 Access Network Identifier option which
   requires assignment of DHCPv4 option code TBD1 assigned from "Bootp
   and DHCP options" registry (http://www.iana.org/assignments/
   bootp-dhcp-parameters/bootp-dhcp-parameters.xml), as specified in
   [RFC2939].

   IANA is requested to assign option codes for the following DHCPv6
   options from the "DHCPv6 and DHCPv6 options" registry (http://
   www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters/dhcpv6-parameters.xml).

          Option Code             Descrption
          ---------------   ----------------------
              TBD2           OPTION_DHCPV6_ACCESS_NETWORK_ID
              TBD3           OPTION_ANI_ATT
              TBD4           OPTION_ANI_NETWORK_ID
              TBD5           OPTION_ANI_OPERATOR_ID

9.1.  DHCPv4 Access-Network-Identifier Sub-option registry

   IANA is required to maintain a new number space of "DHCPv4 Access
   Network Identifier Sub-options", with the initial sub-options as
   described in this document.  IANA assigns future DHCPv4 Access
   Network Identifier Sub-options with a "IETF Consensus" policy as
   described in [RFC2434].  Future proposed sub-options are to be
   referenced symbolically in the internet-drafts that describe them,
   and shall be assigned numeric codes by IANA when and if the draft is
   approved by IESG for Proposed Standard RFC status.


10.  Security Considerations

   Since there is no privacy protection for DHCP messages, an
   eavesdropper who can monitor the link between the DHCP server, relay
   agent and client can discover access network information.

   To minimize the unintended exposure of this information, this option
   SHOULD be included by DHCP entities only when it is configured.
   Where critical decisions might be based on the value of this option,
   DHCP authentication as defined in "Authentication for DHCP Messages"

   [RFC3118] and "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"
   [RFC3315] SHOULD be used to protect the integrity of the DHCP
   options.  Link-layer confidentiality and integrity protection may
   also be employed to reduce the risk of disclosure and tampering.

   Security issues related DHCPv6 are described in section 23 of
   [RFC3315].
