    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS Resource Record allows a
        DNS domain name holder to specify the Certification Authorities authorized
        to issue certificates for that domain. Publication of CAA resource records
        allow a public Certification Authority (CA) to implement additional
        controls to reduce the risk of unintended certificate mis-issue.
      </t>
      <t>
        Conformance with a published CAA record is a necessary but not sufficient
        condition for issueance of a certificate.
        Before issuing a certificate, a PKIX CA is required to validate the
        request according to the policies set out in its Certificate Policy
        Statement. In the case of a public CA that validates certificate requests
        as a third party, the certificate will be typically issued under
        a public trust anchor certificate embedded in one or more relevant Relying Applications.
      </t>
      <t>
        Criteria for inclusion of embedded trust anchor certificates in applications
        are outside the scope of this document. Typically such criteria require the CA to publish a
        Certificate Practices Statement (CPS) that specifies how the requirements
        of the Certificate Policy (CP) are achieved. It is also common
        for a CA to engage an independent third party auditor to prepare an annual
        audit statement of its performance against its CPS.
      </t>
      <t>
        A set of CAA records describes only current grants of authority to issue 
        certificates for the corresponding DNS domain.
        Since a certificate is typically valid
        for at least a year, it is possible that a certificate that is not
        conformant with the CAA records currently published was conformant
        with the CAA records published at the time that the certificate was issued.
        Relying Applications MUST NOT use CAA records as part of certificate 
        validation.
      </t>
      <t>
        CAA Records MAY be used by Certificate Evaluators as a possible indicator
        of a security policy violation. Such use SHOULD take account of the
        possibility that published CAA records changed between the time a
        certificate was issued and the time at which the certificate was observed by the
        Certificate Evaluator.
      </t>

      <section title="The CAA RR type">
        <t>
          A CAA RR consists of a flags byte and a tag-value pair referred to as 
          a property. Multiple properties MAY be associated
          with the same domain name by publishing multiple CAA RRs at that
          domain name. The following flag is defined:
        </t>
        <t>
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Issuer Critical:">
              If set, indicates that the corresponding property entry
              tag MUST be understood if the semantics of the CAA
              record are to be correctly interpreted by an issuer.
            </t>
            <t>
              Issuers MUST NOT issue certificates for a domain if
              the Extended Issuer Authorization Set contains unknown
              property entry tags that have the  Critical
              bit set.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          The following property tags are defined:
        </t>
        <t>
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="issue &lt;Issuer Domain Name&gt; [; &lt;tag=value&gt; ]* :">
              The issue property entry authorizes the holder of the
              domain name &lt;Issuer Domain Name&gt; or a party acting under the express
              written authority of the holder of that domain name to issue
              certificates for the domain in which the property is published.
            </t>
            <t hangText="iodef &lt;URL&gt; :">
              Specifies a URL to which an issuer
              MAY report certificate
              issue requests that are inconsistent with the issuer's Certification
              Practices or Certificate Policy, or that a certificate evaluator may
              use to report observation of a possible policy violation. The IODEF
              format is used
              <xref target="RFC5070"/>.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>
          The following example informs CAs that certificates MUST NOT be issued
          except by the holder of the domain name 'ca.example.net' or an
          authorized agent thereof.
          Since the policy is published
          at the Public Delegation Point, the policy applies to all subordinate
          domains under example.com.
        </t>

          </artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>
          If the domain name holder specifies one or more iodef properties, a
          certificate issuer MAY report invalid certificate requests to that address.
          In the following example the domain name holder specifies that reports MAY
          be made by means of email with the IODEF data as an attachment or a Web
          service or both:
        </t>
        <figure>

          </artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>
          A certificate issuer MAY specify additional parameters that allow
          customers to specify additional parameters governing certificate issuance.
          This might be the Certificate Policy under which the certificate is
          to be issued, the authentication process to be used might be specified
          or an account number specified by the CA to enable these parameters to be
          retrieved.
        </t>
        <t>
          For example, the CA 'ca.example.net' has requested its customer 'example.com' to 
          specify the CA's account number '230123' in each of the customer's CAA records.
        </t>
        <figure>

        </figure>
        <t>
          The syntax and semantics of such parameters is left to site policy and is
          outside the scope of this document.
        </t>
        <t>
          Future versions of this specification MAY use the critical
          flag to introduce new semantics that MUST be understood for
          correct processing of the record, preventing conforming CAs
           that do not recognize the record from issuing
          certificates for the indicated domains.
        </t>
        <t>
          In the following example, the property 'tbs' is flagged as
          critical. Neither the example.net CA, nor any other issuer is
          authorized to issue under either policy unless the processing rules for the
          'tbs' property tag are understood.
        </t>

        </figure>
        <t>
          Note that the above restrictions only apply to issue of certificates.
          Since the validity of an end entity certificate is typically a
          year or more, it is quite possible that the CAA records published
          at a domain will change between the time a certificate was issued and
          validation by a relying party.

      </section>
    </section>
    <section title="Certification Authority Processing">

      <t>
        Before issuing a certificate, a compliant CA MUST check for publication
        of a relevant CAA Resource Record(s).  If such record(s) are published,
        the  requested certificate MUST consistent with them if it is to be issued. 
        If the certificate
        requested is not consistent with the relevant CAA RRs, the CA MUST
        NOT issue the certificate.
      </t>
      <t>
        The Issuer Authorization Set for a domain name consists of the set of
        all CAA Authorization Entries declared for the canonical form
        of the specified domain.
      </t>
      <t>
        The DNS defines the CNAME and DNAME mechanisms for specifying
        domain name aliases. The canonical name of a DNS name is the
        name that results from performing all DNS alias operations.
        An issuer MUST perform CNAME and DNAME
        processing as defined in the DNS specifications <xref target="RFC1035"/> to resolve CAA records.
      </t>
      <t>
        The Extended Issuer Authorization Set for a domain name is determined as
        follows:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>
            If the Issuer Authorization Set of the domain is not empty, the
            Extended Issuer Authorization Set is the Issuer Authorization Set
            of the domain.
          </t>
          <t>
            If the immediately superior node in the DNS hierarchy is a
            Public Delegation Point, the Extended Issuer Authorization Set
            is empty.
          </t>
          <t>
            Otherwise the Extended Issuer Authorization Set is that of the
            immediately superior node in the DNS hierarchy.
          </t>
        </list>

      </t>
      <t>
        For example, if the zone example.com has a CAA record defined for
        caa.example.com and no other domain in the zone, the Issuer Authorization
        Set is empty for all domains other than caa.example.com. The
        Extended Issuer Authorization Set is empty for example.com (because
        .com is a Public Delegation Point) and for x.example.com. The Extended
        Issuer set for x.caa.example.com, x.x.caa.example.com, etc. is the
        Issuer Authorization Set for caa.example.com.
      </t>


      <t>
        If the Extended Issuer Authorization Set for a domain name is not empty, a
        Certification Authority MUST NOT issue a certificate unless the certificate conforms
        to at least one authorization entry in the Extended Issuer Authorization Set.
      </t>

      <section title="Use of DNS Security">
        <t>
          Use of DNSSEC to authenticate CAA RRs is strongly RECOMMENDED but
          not required. An issuer MUST NOT issue certificates if doing so would
          conflict with the corresponding extended issuer authorization set,
          irrespective of
          whether the corresponding DNS records are signed.
        </t>
        <t>
          Use of DNSSEC allows an issuer to acquire and archive a non-repudiable
          proof that they were authorized to issue certificates for the domain.

          A CAA record with an issue parameter tag that specifies a

          For example, the following CAA record set requests that

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        CAA Records assert a security policy that the holder of a domain name
        wishes to be observed by certificate issuers. The effectiveness of CAA
        records as an access control mechanism is thus dependent on observance of CAA
        constraints by issuers.
      </t>
      <t>
        Observance of CAA records by issuers is subject to accountability controls.
      </t>
      <t>
        While a Certification Authority can choose to ignore published CAA
        records, doing so increases  both the probability that they will
        mis-issue a certificate and the consequences of doing so. Once it is
        known that a CA observes CAA records, malicious registration requests
        may  disproportionately target the (negligent) CAs that do not,
        and so the mis-issue rate amongst the negligent CAs will likely increase.
        Since a CA could  have avoided the mis-issue by performing
        CAA processing, the likelihood of sanctions against a negligent CA
        is increased. Failure to observe CAA issue restrictions provides an
        objective criteria for excluding issuers from embedded trust anchors.
      </t>
      <t>
        In the case that a mis-issue event occurs for a domain that does 
        not have CAA records published, a conformant CA may be able to claim that
        the incident could have been avoided had the domain name owner published
        appropriate records.
      </t>

      <section title="Mis-Issue by Authorized Certification Authority">
        <t>
          Use of CAA records does not prevent mis-issue
          by an authorized Certification Authority. , i.e., a CA that is 
          authorized to issue certificates for the domain in question by CAA records..
        </t>
        <t>
          Domain name holders SHOULD verify that the CAs they authorize to issue
          certificates for their domains employ appropriate controls to ensure
          that certificates are issued only to authorized parties within their
          organization.
        </t>
        <t>
          Such controls are most appropriately determined by the domain name
          holder and the authorized CA(s) directly and are thus out of scope
          of this document.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Suppression or spoofing of CAA records">
        <t>
          Suppression of the CAA record or insertion of a bogus CAA record could
          enable an attacker to obtain a certificate from a CA that was not
          authorized to issue for that domain name.
        </t>
        <t>
          A CA MUST mitigate this risk by employing DNSSEC verification whenever
          possible and rejecting certificate requests in any case where it is
          not possible to verify the non-existence or contents of a relevant
          CAA record.
        </t>
        <t>
          In cases where DNSSEC is not deployed in a corresponding domain, a
          CA SHOULD attempt to mitigate this risk by employing appropriate
          DNS security controls. For example all portions of the DNS lookup
          process SHOULD be performed against the authoritative name server.
          Data cached by third parties MUST NOT be relied on but MAY be used to support additional
          anti-spoofing or anti-suppression controls.

    <section title="Denial of Service">
      <t>
        Introduction of a malformed or malicious CAA RR could in theory
        enable a Denial of Service attack.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specific threat is not considered to add significantly to
        the risk of running an insecure DNS service.
      </t>

        <t>
          An attacker could, in principle, perform a Denial of Service attack
          against an issuer by requesting a certificate with a maliciously long
          DNS name. In practice, the DNS protocol imposes a maximum name length
          and CAA processing does not exacerbate the existing need to mitigate
          Denial of Service attacks to any meaningful degree.
        </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Abuse of the Critical Flag">
      <t>
        A Certification Authority could make use of the critical flag
        to trick customers into publishing records which prevent
        competing Certification Authorities from issuing certificates
        even though the customer intends to authorize multiple
        providers.
      </t>
      <t>
        In practice, such an attack would be of minimal effect since
        any competent competitor that found itself unable to issue certificates
        due to lack of support for a property marked critical SHOULD
        investigate the cause and report the reason to the customer
        who will thus discover the deception. It is thus unlikely that the attack would
        succeed and the attempt might lay the perpetrator open to
        civil or criminal sanctions.
