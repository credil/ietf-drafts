        Abstract: This document specifies a Kerberos Authorization
        Data container that supersedes AD-KDC-ISSUED. It allows for
        multiple Message Authentication Codes (MACs) or signatures to
        authenticate the contained Authorization Data elements.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        This document specifies a new Authorization Data container for
        Kerberos, called AD-CAMMAC (Container Authenticated by
        Multiple MACs), that supersedes AD-KDC-ISSUED. This new
        container allows both the receiving application service and
        the Key Distribution Center (KDC) itself to verify the
        authenticity of the contained authorization data. The
        AD-CAMMAC container can also include additional verifiers that
        "trusted services" can use to verify the contained
        authorization data.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements Language">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Motivations">
      <t>
	The new AD-CAMMAC authorization data container specified in
	this document is an improvement upon AD-KDC-ISSUED because it
	provides assurance to the KDC that the service named in the
	ticket did not tamper with the contained authorization data.
	By adding MACs verifiable by the KDC and trusted services,
	AD-CAMMAC enables several new use cases for the Kerberos
	protocol that AD-KDC-ISSUED does not accommodate.
      </t>
      <t>
	The existing AD-KDC-ISSUED authorization data container allows
	a service to verify that the KDC has issued the contained
	authorization data.  However, because the symmetric key for
	the MAC is known to both the KDC and the service, the KDC
	cannot generally detect whether the service has forged the
	contents of an AD-KDC-ISSUED container in an existing ticket.
	The new kdc-verifier MAC in the AD-CAMMAC container, because
	it uses a key known only to the KDC, allows the KDC to verify
	the integrity of the contents of that container.
      </t>
      <t>
	For example, the new AD-CAMMAC container can protect
	authorization data when using the Constrained Delegation
	(<xref target="MS-SFU">S4U2Proxy</xref>) protocol extension.
	This extension allows a service to use a ticket to itself as
	evidence that it received a user request and consequently ask
	the KDC to issue a new ticket on behalf of the user to perform
	operations against another service.
      </t>
      <t>
	If the KDC had issued a AD-KDC-ISSUED container in the
	S4U2Proxy evidence ticket instead of AD-CAMMAC, it would have
	no way to subsequently verify whether the service had tampered
	with the contents of that container.  The service would know
	the key for the MAC for the AD-KDC-ISSUED container in the
	evidence ticket, and could therefore forge its contents.
      </t>
      <t>
	The kdc-verifier MAC in the AD-CAMMAC container allows a KDC
	to verify the integrity of the contained authorization data
	without having to compute all of the authorization data, an
	operation that might not always be possible when the data
	contains ephemeral information such as the strength or type of
	authentication method used to obtain the original ticket.
      </t>
      <t>
	A lesser-privileged service on a host may receive an
	authentication from a client, and might then ask a
	higher-privileged service ("trusted service") on the same host
	to act on behalf of the client.  To demonstrate that the
	client has authenticated to it, the lesser-privileged service
	can extract the AD-CAMMAC container from the ticket and submit
	it to the trusted service.  The trusted service can either ask
	a specialized service (not yet specified) on the KDC to
	validate the AD-CAMMAC container, or use verify the optional
	additional verifiers (the other-verifiers field) that are part
	of the AD-CAMMAC.

    <section title="Encoding">
      <t>
        The Kerberos protocol is defined in <xref target="RFC4120"/>
        using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) <xref
        target="X.680"/><xref target="X.690"/>. For consistency, this
        specification also uses the ASN.1 syntax for specifying the
        layout of AD-CAMMAC.  The ad-data of the AD-CAMMAC
        authorization data element is the ASN.1 DER encoding of the
        AD-CAMMAC ASN.1 type specified below.

              PrincipalName MUST be present and be a valid principal
              in the realm.  KDCs MAY add one or more 'trusted

      <t>
        Although authorization data are generally conveyed within the
        encrypted part of a ticket and are thereby protected by the
        existing encryption methods on the ticket, some authorization
        data requires the additional protection provided by the
        CAMMAC.
      </t>
      <t>
	Some protocol extensions such as S4U2Proxy allow the KDC to
	issue a new ticket based on an evidence ticket provided by the
	service.  If the evidence ticket contains authorization data
	that needs to be preserved in the new ticket, then the KDC
	MUST revalidate it.
      </t>
      <t>
        Extracting a CAMMAC from a ticket for use as a credential
        removes it from the context of the ticket. In the general
        case, this could turn it into a bearer token, with all of the
        associated security implications. Also, the CAMMAC does not
        itself necessarily contain sufficient information to identify
        the client principal. Therefore, application protocols that
        rely on extracted CAMMACs might need to duplicate a
        substantial portion of the ticket contents and include that
        duplicated information in the authorization data contained
        within the CAMMAC.
      </t>
      <t>
        A KDC that needs to verify the contents of a CAMMAC in a
        non-TGS ticket MUST ensure that the CAMMAC in the ticket is
        the same one that it inserted into the ticket. A malicious
        service could substitute legitimate CAMMACs from other tickets
        that it has received (but not fabricate completely new
        CAMMACs) into a service ticket. A CAMMAC by itself does not
        contain sufficient information to accomplish this, but
        including an AD-CAMMAC-BINDING element could be sufficient.
