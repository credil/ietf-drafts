   to solve certain problems in the CoRE WG's main protocol, the
   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).  The current version has
   been resubmitted to keep information about these proposals available;
   the proposals are not all fleshed out at this point in time.

1.  Introduction

   The CoRE WG is tasked with standardizing an Application Protocol for
   Constrained Networks/Nodes, CoAP [I-D.ietf-core-coap].  This protocol
   is intended to provide RESTful [REST] services not unlike HTTP
   [RFC2616], while reducing the complexity of implementation as well as
   the size of packets exchanged in order to make these services useful
   in a highly constrained network of themselves highly constrained
   nodes.

   This objective requires restraint in a number of sometimes
   conflicting ways:

   o  reducing implementation complexity in order to minimize code size,

   o  reducing message sizes in order to minimize the number of
      fragments needed for each message (in turn to maximize the
      probability of delivery of the message), the amount of
      transmission power needed and the loading of the limited-bandwidth
      channel,

   o  reducing requirements on the environment such as stable storage,
      good sources of randomness or user interaction capabilities.

   This draft attempts to address a number of problems not yet
   adequately solved in [I-D.ietf-core-coap].  The solutions proposed to
   these problems are somewhat interrelated and are therefore presented
   in one draft.

   The appendix contains the "CoAP cemetery" (possibly later to move
   into its own draft), documenting roads that the WG decided not to
   take, in order to spare readers from reinventing them in vain.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The term "byte" is used in its now customary sense as a synonym for
   "octet".

2.  Getting rid of artificial limitations

   _Artificial limitations_ are limitations of a protocol or system that
   are not rooted in limitations of actual capabilities, but in
   arbitrary design decisions.  Proper system design tries to avoid
   artificial limitations, as these tend to cause complexity in systems
   that need to work with these limitations.

   E.g., the original UNIX filesystem had an artificial limitation of
   the length of a path name component to 14 bytes.  This led to all
   kinds of workarounds in programs that manipulate file names: E.g.,
   systematically replacing a ".el" extension in a filename with a
   ".elc" for the compiled file might exceed the limit, so all ".el"
   files were suddenly limited to 13-byte filenames.

   Note that, today, there still is a limitation in most file system
   implementations, typically at 255.  This just happens to be high
   enough to rarely be of real-world concern; we will refer to this case
   as a "painless" artificial limitation.

   CoAP-08 had two highly recognizable artificial limitations in its
   protocol encoding

   o  The number of options in a single message is limited to 15 max.

   o  The length of an option is limited to 270 max.

   It has been argued that the latter limitation causes few problems,
   just as the 255-byte path name component limitation in filenames
   today causes few problems.  Appendix B.2 provided a design to extend
   this; as a precaution to future extensions of this kind, the current
   encoding for length 270 (eight ones in the extension byte) could be
   marked as reserved today.  Since, Matthias Kovatsch has proposed a
   simpler scheme that seems to gain favor in the WG, see Section 2.1.

   The former limitation has been solved in CoAP-09.  A historical
   discussion of other approaches for going beyond 15 options is in
   Appendix B.3.  Appendix B.4 discusses implementation.

2.1.  Option Length encoding beyond 270 bytes

   For option lengths beyond 270 bytes, we reserve the value 255 of an
   extension byte to mean "add 255, read another extension byte"
   Figure 1.  While this causes the length of the option header to grow
   linearly with the size of the option value, only 0.4 % of that size
   is used.  With a focus on short options, this encoding is justified.

   In the process, the maximum length of all options that are currently
   set at 270 should now be set to infinite.  With the artificial limit
   gone, Uri-Proxy should now be restored to be a non-repeatable option.

3.  Vendor-defined Option

   To enable experimentation and community-specific options, option
   number 14 (the first NOP option) can also be used as a vendor-defined
   option.  For this application, the option value has one or more
   bytes, the semantics of which are defined by prior agreement between
   the communicating partners.

   It is RECOMMENDED to start the option value with a unique identifier,
   e.g., the SDNV [RFC5050] of the enterprise number of the organisation
   defining the option, possibly followed by additional discriminating
   bits or bytes as defined by the organisation.

         Figure 2: Example option value for vendor-defined option

   Note that a Vendor-defined Option cannot be empty, not only because
   there would be no space for the SDNV, but in particular as the empty
   option 14 is reserved for fenceposting ([I-D.ietf-core-coap], section
   3.2).  (Obviously, once a Vendor-defined Option is in use, there is
   never a need for a fence-post for option number 14.)

   Vendor-defined Options are elective.

   The Vendor-defined Option is repeatable.

4.  Patience, Leisure, and Pledge

   A number of options might be useful for controlling the timing of
   interactions.

   (This section also addresses core-coap ticket #177.)

4.1.  Patience

   A client may have a limited time period in which it can actually make
   use of the response for a request.  Using the Patience option, it can
   provide an (elective) indication how much time it is willing to wait
   for the response from the server, giving the server license to ignore
   or reject the request if it cannot fulfill it in this period.

   If the server knows early that it cannot fulfill the request in the
   time requested, it MAY indicate this with a 5.04 "Timeout" response.
   For non-safe methods (such as PUT, POST, DELETE), the server SHOULD
   indicate whether it has fulfilled the request by either responding
   with 5.04 "Timeout" (and not further processing the request) or by
   processing the request normally.

   Note that the value of the Patience option should be chosen such that
   the client will be able to make use of the result even in the
   presence of the expected network delays for the request and the
   response.  Similarly, when a proxy receives a request with a Patience
   option and cannot fulfill that request from its cache, it may want to
   adjust the value of the option before forwarding it to an upstream
   server.

   (TBD: The various cases that arise when combining Patience with
   Observe.)

   The Patience option is elective.  Hence, a client MUST be prepared to
   receive a normal response even after the chosen Patience period (plus
   an allowance for network delays) has elapsed.

4.2.  Leisure

   Servers generally will compute an internal value that we will call
   Leisure, which indicates the period of time that will be used for
   responding to a request.  A Patience option, if present, can be used
   as an upper bound for the Leisure.  Leisure may be non-zero for
   congestion control reasons, in particular for responses to multicast
   requests.  For these, the server should have a group size estimate G,
   a target rate R (which both should be chosen conservatively) and an
   estimated response size S; a rough lower bound for Leisure can then
   be computed as follows:



Bormann & Hartke       Expires September 29, 2012               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                  CoAP-misc                     March 2012


     lb_Leisure = S * G / R

             Figure 3: Computing a lower bound for the Leisure

   E.g., for a multicast request with link-local scope on an 2.4 GHz
   IEEE 802.15.4 (6LoWPAN) network, G could be (relatively
   conservatively) set to 100, S to 100 bytes, and the target rate to 8
   kbit/s = 1 kB/s.  The resulting lower bound for the Leisure is 10
   seconds.

   To avoid response implosion, responses to multicast requests SHOULD
   be dithered within a Leisure period chosen by the server to fall
   between these two bounds.

   Currently, we don't foresee a need to signal a value for Leisure from
   client to server (beyond the signalling provided by Patience) or from
   server to client, but an appropriate Option might be added later.

4.3.  Pledge

   In a basic observation relationship [I-D.ietf-core-observe], the
   server makes a pledge to keep the client in the observation
   relationship for a resource at least until the max-age for the
   resource is reached.

   To save the client some effort in re-establishing observation
   relationships each time max-age is reached, the server MAY want to
   extend its pledge beyond the end of max-age by signalling in a
   response/notification an additional time period using the Pledge
   Option, in parallel to the Observe Option.

   The Pledge Option MUST NOT be used unless the server can make a
   reasonable promise not to lose the observation relationship in this
   time frame.

   Currently, we don't foresee a need to signal a value for Pledge from
   client to server, but an appropriate behavior might be added later
   for this option when sent in a request.

4.4.  Option Formats

    +-----+----------+----------+-----------------+--------+---------+
    | No. | C/E      | Name     | Format          | Length | Default |
    +-----+----------+----------+-----------------+--------+---------+
    | 22  | Elective | Patience | Duration in mis | 1 B    | (none)  |
    |     |          |          |                 |        |         |
    | 24  | Elective | Pledge   | Duration in s   | 1 B    | 0       |

   All timing options use the Duration data type (see Appendix C.2),
   however Patience (and Leisure, if that ever becomes an option) uses a
   timebase of mibiseconds (mis = 1/1024 s) instead of seconds.  (This
   reduces the range of the Duration from ~ 91 days to 128 minutes.)

   Implementation note:  As there are no strong accuracy requirements on
      the clocks employed, making use of any existing time base of
      milliseconds is a valid implementation approach (2.4 % off).

   None of the options may be repeated.

5.  Combining Content-Type and Content-Encoding

   (This section addresses core-coap ticket #181.)

   There may be rare cases where the Content-Encoding concept of HTTP
   may be applicable to CoAP as well.  Instead of defining another
   option to carry that information, the decision was to combine it with
   the Internet Media Type into the single Option unfortunately called
   Content-Type.

   In Section 5.10.4, add behind:

   5.10.4.  Content-Type

   The Content-Type Option indicates the representation format of the
   message payload.  The representation format is given as a numeric
   media type identifier that is defined in the CoAP Media Type registry
   (Section 11.3).  No default value is assumed in the absence of the
   option.

                                 Figure 4

   the new text:

   Apart from indicating the equivalent of an HTTP Content-Type, a media
   type identifier registry entry may also incorporate the equivalent of
   one or more Content-Encodings [RFC2616].

   and continue:

   This option is "critical".  It MUST NOT occur more than once.

                                 Figure 5

   In Section 11.3, change table 5 to:

Appendix A.  The Nursery (Things that still need to ripen a bit)

A.1.  Payload-Length Option

   Not all transport mappings may provide an unambiguous length of the
   CoAP message.  For UDP, it may also be desirable to pack more than
   one CoAP message into one UDP payload (aggregation); in that case,
   for all but the last message there needs to be a way to delimit the
   payload of that message.

   This can be solved using a new option, the Payload-Length option.  If
   this option is present, the value of this option is an unsigned
   integer giving the length of the payload of the message (note that
   this integer can be zero for a zero-length payload, which can in turn
   be represented by a zero-length option value).  (In the UDP
   aggregation case, what would have been in the payload of this message
   after "payload-length" bytes is then actually one or more additional
   messages.)

A.2.  URI Authorities with Binary Adresses

   One problem with the way URI authorities are represented in the URI
   syntax is that the authority part can be very bulky if it encodes an
   IPv6 address in ASCII.

   Proposal:  Provide an option "Uri-Authority-Binary" that can be an
      even number of bytes between 2 and 18 except 12 or 14.

   o  If the number of bytes is 2, the destination IP address of the
      packet transporting the CoAP message is implied.

   o  If the number of bytes is 4 or 6, the first four bytes of the
      option value are an IPv4 address in binary.

   o  If the number of bytes is 8 or 10, the first eight bytes are the
      lower 64 bits of an IPv6 address; the upper eight bytes are
      implied from the destination address of the packet transporting
      the CoAP message.

   o  If the number of bytes is 16 or 18, the first 16 bytes are an IPv6
      address.

   o  If two more bytes remain, this is a port number (as always in
      network byte order).

   The resulting authority is (conceptually translated into ASCII and)
   used in place of an Uri-Authority option, or inserted into a Proxy-
   Uri. Examples:

A.3.  Length-aware number encoding (o256)

   The number encoding defined in Appendix A of [I-D.ietf-core-coap] has
   one significant flaw: Every number has an infinite number of
   representations, which can be derived by adding leading zero bytes.
   This runs against the principle of minimizing unnecessary choice.
   The resulting uncertainty in encoding ultimately leads to unnecessary
   interoperability failures.  (It also wastes a small fraction of the
   encoding space, i.e., it wastes bytes.)

   We could solve the first, but not the second, by outlawing leading
   zeroes, but then we have to cope with error cases caused by illegal
   values, another source of interoperability problems.

   The number encoding "o256" defined in this section avoids this flaw.
   The suggestion is not to replace CoAP's "uint" encoding wholesale
   (CoAP is already too widely implemented for such a change), but to
   consider this format for new options.

   The basic requirements for such an encoding are:

   o  numbers are encoded as a sequence of zero or more bytes

   o  each number has exactly one encoding

   o  for a < b, encoding-size(a) <= encoding-size(b) -- i.e., with
      larger numbers, the encoding only gets larger, never smaller

      again.

   o  within each encoding size (0 bytes, 1 byte, etc.), lexicographical
      ordering of the bytes is the same as numeric ordering

   Obviously, there is only one encoding that satisfies all these
   requirements.  As illustrated by Figure 6, this is unambiguously
   derived by

   1.  enumerating all possible byte sequences, ordered by length and
       within the same length in lexicographic ordering, and,

   2.  assigning sequential cardinals.


           0x'' -> 0
           0x'00' -> 1
           0x'01' -> 2
           0x'02' -> 3
           ...
           0x'fe' -> 255
           0x'ff' -> 256
           0x'0000' -> 257
           0x'0001' -> 258
           ...
           0x'fefd' -> 65534
           0x'fefe' -> 65535
           0x'feff' -> 65536
           ...
           0x'ffff' -> 65792
           0x'000000' -> 65793
           0x'000001' -> 65794

   Figure 6: Enumerating byte sequences by length and then lexicographic
                                   order

   This results in an exceedingly simple algorithm: each byte is
   interpreted in the base-256 place-value system, but stands for a
   number between 1 and 256 instead of 0 to 255.  We therefore call this
   encoding "o256" (one-to-256). 0 is always encoded in zero bytes; 1 to
   256 is one byte, 257 (0x101) to 65792 (0x10100) is two bytes, 65793
   (0x10101) to 16843008 (0x1010100) is three bytes, etc.

   To further illustrate the algorithmic simplicity, pseudocode for
   encoding and decoding is given in Figure 7 and Figure 8, respectively
   (in the encoder, "prepend" stands for adding a byte at the _leading_
   edge, the requirement for which is a result of the network byte
   order).  Note that this differs only in a single subtraction/addition

   (resp.) of one from the canonical algorithm for Appendix A uints.

       while num > 0
         num -= 1
         prepend(num & 0xFF)
         num >>= 8
       end

                    Figure 7: o256 encoder (pseudocode)


       num = 0
       each_byte do |b|
         num <<= 8
         num += b + 1
       end

                    Figure 8: o256 decoder (pseudocode)

   On a more philosophical note, it can be observed that o256 solves the
   inverse problem of Self-Delimiting Numeric Values (SDNV) [RFC6256]:
   SDNV encodes variable-length numbers together with their length
   (allowing decoding without knowing their length in advance, deriving
   delimiting information from the number encoding). o256 encodes
   variable-length numbers when there is a way to separately convey the
   length (as in CoAP options), encoding (and later deriving) a small
   part of the numeric value into/from that size information.

A.4.  SMS encoding

   For use in SMS applications, CoAP messages can be transferred using
   SMS binary mode.  However, there is operational experience showing
   that some environments cannot successfully send a binary mode SMS.

   For transferring SMS in character mode (7-bit characters), base64-
   encoding [RFC4648] is an obvious choice. 3 bytes of message (24 bits)
   turn into 4 characters, which cosume 28 bits.  The overall overhead
   is approximately 17 %; the maximum message size is 120 bytes (160 SMS
   characters).

   If a more compact encoding is desired, base85 encoding can be
   employed (however, probably not the version defined in [RFC1924] --
   instead, the version used in tools such as btoa and PDF should be
   chosen).  However, this requires division operations.  Also, the
   base85 character set includes several characters that cannot be
   transferred in a single 7-bit unit in SMS and/or are known to cause
   operational problems.  A modified base85 character set can be defined
   to solve the latter problem. 4 bytes of message (32 bits) turn into 5



Bormann & Hartke       Expires September 29, 2012              [Page 20]

Internet-Draft                  CoAP-misc                     March 2012


   characters, which consume 35 bits.  The overall overhead is
   approximately 9.3 %; the resulting maximum message size is 128 bytes
   (160 SMS characters).

   Base64 and base85 do not make use of the fact that much CoAP data
   will be ASCII-based.  Therefore, we define the following experimental
   SMS encoding.

A.4.1.  ASCII-optimized SMS encoding

   Not all 128 theoretically possible SMS characters are operationally
   free of problems.  We therefore define:

   Shunned code characters:  @ sign, as it maps to 0x00

      LF and CR signs (0x0A, 0x0D)

      uppercase C cedilla (0x09), as it is often mistranslated in
      gateways

      ESC (0x1B), as it is used in certain character combinations only

   Some ASCII characters cannot be transferred in the base SMS character
   set, as their code positions are taken by non-ASCII characters.
   These are simply encoded with their ASCII code positions, e.g., an
   underscore becomes a section mark (even though underscore has a
   different code position in the SMS character set).

   Equivalently translated input bytes:  $, @, [, \, ], ^, _, `, {, |,
      }, ~, DEL

   In other words, bytes 0x20 to 0x7F are encoded into the same code
   positions in the 7-bit character set.

   Out of the remaining code characters, the following SMS characters
   are available for encoding:

   Non-equivalently translated (NET) code characters:  0x01 to 0x08, (8
      characters)

      0x0B, 0x0C, (2 characters)

      0x0E to 0x1A, (13 characters)

      0x1C to 0x1F, (4 characters)

   Of the 27 NET code characters, 18 are taken as prefix characters (see
   below), and 8 are defined as directly translated characters:

Internet-Draft                  CoAP-misc                     March 2012


   Directly translated bytes:  Equivalently translated input bytes are
      represented as themselves

      0x00 to 0x07 are represented as 0x01 to 0x08

   This leaves 0x08 to 0x1F and 0x80 to 0xFF.  Of these, the bytes 0x80
   to 0x87 and 0xA0 to 0xFF are represented as the bytes 0x00 to 0x07
   (represented by characters 0x01 to 0x08) and 0x20 to 0x7F, with a
   prefix of 1 (see below).  The characters 0x08 to 0x1F are represented
   as the characters 0x28 to 0x3F with a prefix of 2 (see below).  The
   characters 0x88 to 0x9F are represented as the characters 0x48 to
   0x5F with a prefix of 2 (see below).  (Characters 0x01 to 0x08, 0x20
   to 0x27, 0x40 to 0x47, and 0x60 to 0x7f with a prefix of 2 are
   reserved for future extensions, which could be used for some
   backreferencing or run-length compression.)

   Bytes that do not need a prefix (directly translated bytes) are sent
   as is.  Any byte that does need a prefix (i.e., 1 or 2) is preceded
   by a prefix character, which provides a prefix for this and the
   following two bytes as follows:

                      +------+-----+---+------+-----+
                      | 0x0B | 100 |   | 0x15 | 200 |
                      +------+-----+---+------+-----+
                      | 0x0C | 101 |   | 0x16 | 201 |

   The coding overhead of this encoding for random bytes is similar to
   Base85, without the need for a division/multiplication.  For bytes
   that are mostly ASCII characters, the overhead can easily become
   negative.  (Conversely, for bytes that are more likely to be non-
   ASCII than in a random sequence of bytes, the overhead becomes

Appendix B.  The Cemetery (Things we won't do)

   This annex documents roads that the WG decided not to take, in order
   to spare readers from reinventing them in vain.

B.1.  Stateful URI compression

   Is the approximately 25 % average saving achievable with Huffman-
   based URI compression schemes worth the complexity?  Probably not,
   because much higher average savings can be achieved by introducing
   state.

   Henning Schulzrinne has proposed for a server to be able to supply a
   shortened URI once a resource has been requested using the full-
   length URI.  Let's call such a shortened referent a _Temporary
   Resource Identifier_, _TeRI_ for short.  This could be expressed by a
   response option as shown in Figure 12.

           0
           0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
          |    duration   |    TeRI...
          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

            Figure 12: Option for offering a TeRI in a response

   The TeRI offer option indicates that the server promises to offer
   this resources under the TeRI given for at least the time given as
   the duration.  Another TeRI offer can be made later to extend the
   duration.

   Once a TeRI for a URI is known (and still within its lifetime), the
   client can supply a TeRI instead of a URI in its requests.  The same
   option format as an offer could be used to allow the client to
   indicate how long it believes the TeRI will still be valid (so that
   the server can decide when to update the lifetime duration).  TeRIs
   in requests could be distinguished from URIs e.g. by using a
   different option number.

   Proposal:  Add a TeRI option that can be used in CoAP requests and
      responses.

      Add a way to indicate a TeRI and its duration in a link-value.

      Do not add any form of stateless URI encoding.

   Benefits:  Much higher reduction of message size than any stateless
      URI encoding could achieve.

      As the use of TeRIs is entirely optional, minimal complexity nodes
      can get by without implementing them.

   Drawbacks:  Adds considerable state and complexity to the protocol.

      It turns out that real CoAP URIs are short enough that TeRIs are
      not needed.

      (Discuss the security implications of TeRIs.)

B.2.  Beyond 270 bytes in a single option

   The authors would argue that 270 as the maximum length of an option
   is already beyond the "painless" threshold.

   If that is not the consensus of the WG, the scheme can easily be
   extended as in Figure 13:

                                               for 15..269:
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   | Option Delta  | 1   1   1   1 |          Length - 15          |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   |   Option Value ...
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

                                               for 270..65805:
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   | Option Delta  | 1   1   1   1 | 1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1 |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   |              Length - 270 (in network byte order)             |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   |   Option Value ...
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

                Figure 13: Ridiculously Long Option Header

   The infinite number of obvious variations on this scheme are left as
   an exercise to the reader.

   Again, as a precaution to future extensions, the current encoding for
   length 270 (eight ones in the extension byte) could be marked as
   reserved today.

B.3.  Beyond 15 options

   (This section keeps discussion that is no longer needed as we have
   agreed to do what is documented in Appendix B.4).

   The limit of 15 options is motivated by the fixed four-bit field "OC"
   that is used for indicating the number of options in the fixed-length
   CoAP header (Figure 14).

     0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

            Figure 14: Four-byte fixed header in a CoAP Message

   Note that there is another fixed four-bit field in CoAP: the option
   length (Figure 15 - note that this figure is not to the same scale as
   the previous figure):

     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   | Option Delta  |    Length     | for 0..14

   |   Option Value ...
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

                      Figure 15: Short Option Header

   Since 15 is inacceptable for a maximum option length, the all-ones
   value (15) was taken out of the set of allowable values for the short
   header, and a long header was introduced that allows the insertion of
   an extension byte (Figure 16):

                                               for 15..270:
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   We might want to use the same technique for the CoAP header as well.
   There are two obvious places where the extension byte could be
   placed:

   1.  right after the byte carrying the OC field, so the structure is
       the same as for the option header;

   2.  right after the fixed-size CoAP header.

   Both solutions lose the fixed-size-ness of the CoAP header.

   Solution 1 has the disadvantage that the CoAP header is also changing
   in structure: The extension byte is wedged between the first and the
   second byte of the CoAP header.  This is unfortunate, as the number
   of options only comes into play when the option processing begins, so
   it is more natural to use solution 2 (Figure 17):

     0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Ver| T |  15   |      Code     |          Message ID           |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |    OC - 15    |   Options ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   Payload (if any) ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

       Figure 17: Extended header for CoAP Messages with 15+ options

   This would allow for up to 270 options in a CoAP message, which is
   very likely way beyond the "painless" threshold.

B.3.1.  Implementation considerations

   For a message decoder, this extension creates relatively little pain,
   as the number of options only becomes interesting when the encoding
   turns to the options part of the message, which is then simply lead
   in by the extension byte if the four-bit field is 15.

   For a message encoder, this extension is not so rosy.  If the encoder
   is constructing the message serially, it may not know in advance
   whether the number of options will exceed 14.  None of the following
   implementation strategies is particularly savory, but all of them do
   work:

   1.  Encode the options serially under the assumption that the number
       of options will be 14 or less.  When the 15th option needs to be
       encoded, abort the option encoding, and restart it from scratch

       one byte further to the left.

   2.  Similar to 1, except that the bytes already encoded are all moved
       one byte to right, the extension byte is inserted, and the option
       encoding process is continued.

   3.  The encoder always leaves space for the extension byte (at least
       if it can't prove the number will be less thatn 14).  If the
       extension byte is not needed, an Option 0 with length 0 is
       encoded instead (i.e., one byte is wasted - this option is
       elective and will be ignored by the receiver).

   As a minimum, to enable strategy 3, the option 0 should be reserved
   at least for the case of length=0.

B.3.2.  What should we do now?

   As a minimum proposal for the next version of CoAP, the value 15 for
   OC should be marked as reserved today.

B.3.3.  Alternatives

   One alternative that has been discussed previously is to have an
   "Options" Option, which allows the carriage of multiple options in
   the belly of a single one.  This could also be used to carry more
   than 15 options.  However:

   o  The conditional introduction of an Options option has
      implementation considerations that are likely to be more severe
      than the ones listed above;

   o  since 270 bytes may not be enough for the encoding of _all_
      options, the "Options" option would need to be repeatable.  This
      creates many different ways to encode the same message, leading to
      combinatorial explosion in test cases for ensuring
      interoperability.

B.3.4.  Alternative: Going to a delimiter model

   Another alternative is to spend the additional byte not as an
   extended count, but as an option terminator.

B.4.  Implementing the option delimiter for 15 or more options

   Implementation note:  As can be seen from the proof of concept code
      in Figure 18, the actual implementation cost for a decoder is
      around 4 lines of code (or about 8-10 machine code instructions).


         while numopt > 0
           nextbyte = ... get next byte

           if numopt == 15                  # new
             break if nextbyte == 0xF0      # new
           else                             # new
             numopt -= 1
           end                              # new

           ... decode the delta and length from nextbyte and handle them
         end

               Figure 18: Implementing the Option Terminator

   Similarly, creating the option terminator needs about four more lines
   (not marked "old" in the C code in Figure 19).

       b0 = 0x40 + (tt << 4);              /* old */

          buffer[pos++] = 0xF0;            /* use delimiter */
       else                                /* save a byte: */

Appendix C.  Experimental Options

   This annex documents proposals that need significant additional
   discussion before they can become part of (or go back to) the main
   CoAP specification.  They are not dead, but might die if there turns
   out to be no good way to solve the problem.

C.1.  Options indicating absolute time

   HTTP has a number of headers that may indicate absolute time:

   o  "Date", defined in Section 14.18 in [RFC2616] (Section 9.3 in
      [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging]), giving the absolute time a
      response was generated;

   o  "Last-Modified", defined in Section 14.29 in [RFC2616], (Section
      6.6 in [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p4-conditional], giving the absolute time
      of when the origin server believes the resource representation was
      last modified;

   o  "If-Modified-Since", defined in Section 14.25 in [RFC2616],
      "If-Unmodified-Since", defined in Section 14.28 in [RFC2616], and
      "If-Range", defined in Section 14.27 in [RFC2616] can be used to
      supply absolute time to gate a conditional request;

   o  "Expires", defined in Section 14.21 in [RFC2616] (Section 3.3 in
      [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p6-cache]), giving the absolute time after which
      a response is considered stale.

   o  The more obscure headers "Retry-After", defined in Section 14.37
      in [RFC2616], and "Warning", defined in section 14.46 in
      [RFC2616], also may employ absolute time.

   [I-D.ietf-core-coap] defines a single "Date" option, which however
   "indicates the creation time and date of a given resource
   representation", i.e., is closer to a "Last-Modified" HTTP header.
   HTTP's caching rules [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p6-cache] make use of both
   "Date" and "Last-Modified", combined with "Expires".  The specific
   semantics required for CoAP needs further consideration.

   In addition to the definition of the semantics, an encoding for
   absolute times needs to be specified.

   In UNIX-related systems, it is customary to indicate absolute time as
   an integer number of seconds, after midnight UTC, January 1, 1970.
   Unless negative numbers are employed, this time format cannot
   represent time values prior to January 1, 1970, which probably is not
   required for the uses ob absolute time in CoAP.

Internet-Draft                  CoAP-misc                     March 2012


   If a 32-bit integer is used and allowance is made for a sign-bit in a
   local implementation, the latest UTC time value that can be
   represented by the resulting 31 bit integer value is 03:14:07 on
   January 19, 2038.  If the 32-bit integer is used as an unsigned
   value, the last date is 2106-02-07, 06:28:15.

   The reach can be extended by: - moving the epoch forward, e.g. by 40
   years (= 1262304000 seconds) to 2010-01-01.  This makes it impossible
   to represent Last-Modified times in that past (such as could be
   gatewayed in from HTTP). - extending the number of bits, e.g. by one
   more byte, either always or as one of two formats, keeping the 32-bit
   variant as well.

   Also, the resolution can be extended by expressing time in
   milliseconds etc., requiring even more bits (e.g., a 48-bit unsigned
   integer of milliseconds would last well after year 9999.)

   For experiments, an experimental "Date" option is defined with the
   semantics of HTTP's "Last-Modified".  It can carry an unsigned
   integer of 32, 40, or 48 bits; 32- and 40-bit integers indicate the
   absolute time in seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00 UTC, while 48-bit
   integers indicate the absolute time in milliseconds since 1970-01-01
   00:00 UTC.

   However, that option is not really that useful until there is a
   "If-Modified-Since" option as well.

   (Also: Discuss nodes without clocks.)

C.2.  Representing Durations

   Various message types used in CoAP need the representation of
   *durations*, i.e. of the length of a timespan.  In SI units, these
   are measured in seconds.  CoAP durations represent integer numbers of
   seconds, but instead of representing these numbers as integers, a
   more compact single-byte pseudo-floating-point (pseudo-FP)
   representation is used (Figure 20).

           Figure 20: Duration in (8,4) pseudo-FP representation

   If the high bit is clear, the entire n-bit value (including the high
   bit) is the decoded value.  If the high bit is set, the mantissa
   (including the high bit, with the exponent field cleared out but
   still present) is shifted left by the exponent to yield the decoded
   value.

   The (n,e)-pseudo-FP format can be decoded with a single line of code
   (plus a couple of constant definitions), as demonstrated in
   Figure 21.

   #define N 8
   #define E 4
   #define HIBIT (1 << (N - 1))
   #define EMASK ((1 << E) - 1)
   #define MMASK ((1 << N) - 1 - EMASK)

   #define DECODE_8_4(r) (r < HIBIT ? r : (r & MMASK) << (r & EMASK))


               Figure 21: Decoding an (8,4) pseudo-FP value

   Note that a pseudo-FP encoder needs to consider rounding; different
   applications of durations may favor rounding up or rounding down the
   value encoded in the message.

   The highest pseudo-FP value, represented by an all-ones byte (0xFF),
   is reserved to indicate an indefinite duration.  The next lower value
   (0xEF) is thus the highest representable value and is decoded as
   7340032 seconds, a little more than 12 weeks.

C.3.  Rationale

   Where CPU power and memory is abundant, a duration can almost always
   be adequately represented by a non-negative floating-point number
   representing that number of seconds.  Historically, many APIs have
   also used an integer representation, which limits both the resolution
   (e.g., if the integer represents the duration in seconds) and often
   the range (integer machine types have range limits that may become
   relevant).  UNIX's "time_t" (which is used for both absolute time and
   durations) originally was a signed 32-bit value of seconds, but was
   later complemented by an additional integer to add microsecond
   ("struct timeval") and then later nanosecond ("struct timespec")
   resolution.

   Three decisions need to be made for each application of the concept
   of duration:

   o  the *resolution*.  What rounding error is acceptable?

   o  the *range*.  What is the maximum duration that needs to be
      represented?

   o  the *number of bits* that can be expended.

   Obviously, these decisions are interrelated.  Typically, a large
   range needs a large number of bits, unless resolution is traded.  For
   most applications, the actual requirement for resolution are limited
   for longer durations, but can be more acute for shorter durations.

C.4.  Pseudo-Floating Point

   Constrained systems typically avoid the use of floating-point (FP)
   values, as

   o  simple CPUs often don't have support for floating-point datatypes

   o  software floating-point libraries are expensive in code size and
      slow.

   In addition, floating-point datatypes used to be a significant
   element of market differentiation in CPU design; it has taken the
   industry a long time to agree on a standard floating point
   representation.

   These issues have led to protocols that try to constrain themselves
   to integer representation even where the ability of a floating point
   representation to trade range for resolution would be beneficial.

   The idea of introducing _pseudo-FP_ is to obtain the increased range
   provided by embedding an exponent, without necessarily getting stuck
   with hardware datatypes or inefficient software floating-point
   libraries.

   For the purposes of this draft, we define an (n,e)-pseudo-FP as a
   fixed-length value of n bits, e of which may be used for an exponent.
   Figure 20 illustrates an (8,4)-pseudo-FP value.

   If the high bit is clear, the entire n-bit value (including the high
   bit) is the decoded value.  If the high bit is set, the mantissa
   (including the high bit, but with the exponent field cleared out) is
   shifted left by the exponent to yield the decoded value.

   The (n,e)-pseudo-FP format can be decoded with a single line of code
   (plus a couple of constant definition), as demonstrated in Figure 21.

   Only non-negative numbers can be represented by this format.  It is
   designed to provide full integer resolution for values from 0 to
   2^(n-1)-1, i.e., 0 to 127 in the (8,4) case, and a mantissa of n-e
   bits from 2^(n-1) to (2^n-2^e)*2^(2^e-1), i.e., 128 to 7864320 in the
   (8,4) case.  By choosing e carefully, resolution can be traded
   against range.

   Note that a pseudo-FP encoder needs to consider rounding; different
   applications of durations may favor rounding up or rounding down the
   value encoded in the message.  This requires a little more than a
   single line of code (which is left as an exercise to the reader, as
   the most efficient expression depends on hardware details).

C.5.  A Duration Type for CoAP

   CoAP needs durations in a number of places.  In [I-D.ietf-core-coap],
   durations occur in the option "Subscription-lifetime" as well as in
   the option "Max-age".  (Note that the option "Date" is not a
   duration, but a point in time.)  Other durations of this kind may be
   added later.

   Most durations relevant to CoAP are best expressed with a minimum
   resolution of one second.  More detailed resolutions are unlikely to
   provide much benefit.

   The range of lifetimes and caching ages are probably best kept below
   the order of magnitude of months.  An (8,4)-pseudo-FP has the maximum
   value of 7864320, which is about 91 days; this appears to be adequate
   for a subscription lifetime and probably even for a maximum cache
   age.  Figure 22 shows the values that can be expressed.  (If a larger
   range for the latter is indeed desired, an (8,5)-pseudo-FP could be
   used; this would last 15 milleniums, at the cost of having only 3
   bits of accuracy for values larger than 127 seconds.)

   Proposal:  A single duration type is used throughout CoAP, based on
      an (8,4)-pseudo-FP giving a duration in seconds.

   Benefits:  Implementations can use a single piece of code for
      managing all CoAP-related durations.

      In addition, length information never needs to be managed for
      durations that are embedded in other data structures: All
      durations are expressed by a single byte.

   It might be worthwhile to reserve one duration value, e.g. 0xFF, for
   an indefinite duration.
