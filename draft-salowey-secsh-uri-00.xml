      <t>This document describes the Uniform Resource Identifiers used to
      locate resources for the
      Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. The document describes the generic syntax
      involved in URI definitions as well as specific definitions for the
      protocol. These specific definitions include user credentials such
      as username and other parameters such as host key
      fingerprint. </t>

      <t>A hierarchical URI shall consist of the scheme and the scheme
      specific portion separated by a colon ":" followed by the hierarchical
      part, as discussed in <xref target="RFC3986"></xref>. This specification
      uses the definitions "port", "host", "scheme", "userinfo", "path-empty",
      "path-abempty" and "authority" from <xref target="RFC3986"></xref>. This
      document follows the ABNF notation defined in <xref

        <t>The Secure Shell (SSH) scheme shall consist of the scheme name
        "ssh" followed by a colon ":" followed by hier-part defined in <xref

        <t>The following reserved characters from <xref
        target="RFC3986"></xref> are used as delimiters within the SSH URI:
        ";", ",", ":", and "=" . They must not be escaped when used as
        delimiters and must be escaped when the appear in other uses.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sshsemantics" title="URI Semantics">
        <t>The intended usage of the SSH URI is to establish an interactive
        SSH terminal session with the host defined in the authority portion of
        the URI. The only operation defined for the URI is to establish an SSH
        terminal session with a remote host.</t>

        <t>If the userinfo or connection parameters are present the at-sign
        "@" shall precede the authority section of the URI. Optionally, the
        authority section MAY also include the port preceded by a colon ":".
        The host SHOULD be a non-empty string. If the port is not included,
        the default port is assumed.</t>

        <t>The ssh-info portion of the URI MAY include credentials consisting
        of a username followed by optional parameters. The convention of
        including the password separated from the username by a ":" in the URI
        is NOT RECOMMENDED and is deprecated in accordance with <xref
        target="RFC3986"></xref>.</t>

        <t>One or more optional connection parameters (c-param) may be
        specified within the userinfo section of the URI. These
        conn-parameters are separated from the userinfo by a semi-colon ";".
        The only connection parameter defined in this document is for the
        host-key fingerprint described in <xref target="connparam"></xref>. It
        is possible that additional parameters be defined in the future. If a
        connection parameter is not understood it SHOULD be ignored.</t>

        <t>The SSH URI does not define a usage for a non-empty path element.
        If a non-empty path element is included in an SSH URI then it SHOULD
        be ignored.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Encoding Considerations">
        <t>The encoding of the "host" portion of the URI is as defined in
        <xref target="RFC3986"></xref>. The encoding of the connection
        parameters is described in <xref target="connparam"></xref></t>

      <section title="Protocols using this URI scheme">

      <section anchor="connparam" title=" SSH connection parameters ">
        <t>The following parameters are associated with an SSH connection and
        are applicable to SSH and SFTP. All parameters are optional and MUST
        NOT overwrite configured defaults. Individual parameters are separated
        by a comma (",").</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="fingerprint"><vspace blankLines="1" />The fingerprint
            parameter contains the fingerprint of the host key for the host
            specified in the URL. The fingerprint is encoded as
            host-key-alg-fingerprint. Host-key-alg is host public key
            algorithm defined in <xref target="RFC4253"></xref> and the
            fingerprint format is <xref
            target="RFC4716"></xref>. For use in a URI,
            the fingerprint shall use a single dash "-" as a separator instead
            of the colon ":" as described in <xref
            target="RFC4716"></xref>. This parameter MUST
            NOT overwrite a key that is already configured for the host. The
            fingerprint MAY be used to validate the authenticity of the host
            key if the URL was obtained from an authenticated source with its
            integrity protected. If this parameter is not included then the
            host key is validated using another method. See Security
            Considerations section for additional considerations. There MUST
            be only one fingerprint parameter present in a given URL.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Passwords SHOULD NOT be included within the URI as doing so poses a
      security risk. URIs are usually sent in the clear with no encryption or
      other security, any password or other credentials included in the
      userinfo could be seen by a potential attacker.</t>

      <t>Although the host-key fingerprint is not confidential information,
      care must be taken in handling fingerprints associated with URIs because
      URIs transmitted or stored without protection may be modified by an
      attacker. In general an implementation cannot determine the source of a
      URI so a fingerprint received in a URI should have no more trust
      associated with it than a raw public key received in the SSH protocol
      itself. If a locally configured key exists for the server already it
      MUST NOT be automatically overwritten with information from the URI. If
      the host is unknown then the implementation should treat the fingerprint
      received with the same caution that it does with any unknown public key.
      The client MAY offer the fingerprint and URI for external validation
      before allowing a connection based on this information. If the client
      chooses to make a connection based on the URI information and it finds
      that the fingerprint in the URI and the public key offered by the server
      do not match then it SHOULD provide a warning and provide a means to
      abort the connection. Sections 4.1 and 9.2.4 of <xref
      target="RFC4251"></xref> provide a good discussion of handling public
      keys received in the SSH protocol.</t>
