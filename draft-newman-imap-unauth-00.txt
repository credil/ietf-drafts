Internet-Draft  IMAP UNAUTHENTICATE for Connection Reuse    October 2013


1.  Introduction

   Modern IMAP [RFC3501] server deployments often have peer systems with
   administrative privilege that perform actions on behalf of IMAP end-
   users.  For example, a voice mail gateway can use IMAP to store a
   user's voicemail and mark that voicemail as \Seen when the user
   listens to it via the phone interface.  These systems can issue the
   IMAP AUTHENTICATE command with administrative credentials to act on
   behalf of other users.  However, with the IMAP base specification,
   these specialized IMAP clients must close the connection and create a
   new connection for each user.  For efficiency reasons, it is
   desirable for these clients to reuse the same connection,
   particularly if SSL has been negotiated.  This specification proposes
   the UNAUTHENTICATE command to achieve this goal.

   The IMAP state machine described in section 3 of RFC 3501 does not
   have a transition from authenticated or selected state to not
   authenticated state.  The UNAUTHENTICATE command adds a transition
   from authenticated or selected state to not authenticated state.


2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  UNAUTHENTICATE Command

   Arguments:  None

   Responses:  no specific response for this command

   Result:     OK - completed, now in not authenticated state
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

   This command directs the server to reset all connection state, except
   for state at the TLS [RFC5465] layer.  Upon completion, the server
   connection is placed in not authenticated state.  This represents
   transition 7 in the State Machine Diagram (Section 5).

   If a mailbox was selected, the mailbox ceases to be selected but no
   expunge event is generated.  If a SASL [RFC4422] security layer was
   active, it terminates immediately after the server sends the CRLF
   following the OK response.  For the client, it terminates immediately
   after the CRLF following the UNAUTHENTICATE command.

Internet-Draft  IMAP UNAUTHENTICATE for Connection Reuse    October 2013


   After sending this command, the client is free to issue a new
   AUTHENTICATE or LOGIN command as permitted based on the server's
   capabilities.  If no SASL security layer was active, the client is
   permitted to pipeline the UNAUTHENTICATE command with a subsequent
   AUTHENTICATE command.  If the IMAP server also advertises SASL-IR
   [RFC4959], this permits an administrative client to re-authenticate
   in one round trip.  Because of this pipelining optimization, a server
   advertising UNAUTHENTICATE is not permitted to respond to the
   UNAUTHENTICATE command with a NO response if it is unable to reset
   state associated with the connection.  Servers MAY close the
   connection with an untagged BYE response if this preferably rare
   situation occurs.

   The IMAP ID [RFC2971] command provides properties about the client
   primarily for use in server log or audit files.  Because IMAP ID is
   not related to application authentication or user identity in any way
   and caching it for the duration of the client connection can be
   useful, the interaction between IMAP ID and the UNAUTHENTICATE
   command is implementation defined.  For example, a compliant server
   MAY discard cached IMAP ID information in response to an
   UNAUTHENTICATE command.


4.  Interactions

   This section describes interactions between this extension and other
   IMAP extensions or usage models.

4.1.  Stateful Extensions

   This lists some IMAP extensions that have connection state that MUST
   be reset if both the specified extension is advertised and the
   UNAUTHENTICATE command is advertised and used.  This list may not be
   complete; the requirement to reset connection state applies to all
   current and future extensions except STARTTLS and ID.

   o  Cached identity information, such a group memberships, that are
      used to evaluate access control lists [RFC4314] MUST be reset.

   o  CONDSTORE servers [RFC4551] MUST behave as if no CONDSTORE
      enabling command had been issued after an UNAUTHENTICATE command
      is issued.

   o  If IMAP COMPRESS [RFC4978] is active, the compression layer
      terminates after the server sends the CRLF following the OK
      response and after the client sends the CRLF following the
      UNAUTHENTICATE command.  In the event it matters, the compression
      layer terminates before a SASL layer terminates.

Internet-Draft  IMAP UNAUTHENTICATE for Connection Reuse    October 2013


   o  Any extensions enabled by the IMAP ENABLE [RFC5161] command cease
      to be enabled when the UNAUTHENTICATE command is issued.  This
      includes, but is not limited to, CONDSTORE [RFC4551], QRESYNC
      [RFC5162], METADATA [RFC5464], METADATA-SERVER [RFC5464] and
      UTF8=ACCEPT [RFC6855].

   o  A server advertising SEARCHRES [RFC5182] discards any saved search
      results so that '$' subsequently represents the empty set.

   o  A server advertising LANGUAGE [RFC5255] will revert to the
      "i-default" language.

   o  When a server advertises CONTEXT=SEARCH or CONTEXT=SORT [RFC5267],
      the UNAUTHENTICATE command includes an implicit CANCELUPDATE for
      all server contexts.

   o  When a server advertises NOTIFY [RFC5465], the UNAUTHENTICATE
      command cancels server state related to the NOTIFY command and
      reverts to default IMAP base-specification behavior for
      notifications.

4.2.  Client Certificates, SASL EXTERNAL and imaps

   When a TLS [RFC5246] security layer is negotiated either via the
   STARTTLS command or use of the imaps port [RFC6186], IMAP servers MAY
   be configured to request a client certificate and IMAP clients MAY
   provide one.  Client credentials at the TLS layer do not normally
   impact the application layer without use of the SASL EXTERNAL
   mechanism [RFC4422] in an IMAP AUTHENTICATE command that directs to
   the server to use the provided client certificate to authenticate as
   the specified IMAP user.  The UNAUTHENTICATE command breaks any
   application-level binding of the TLS client credentials but does not
   discard the client credentials.  As a result, an administrative
   client may use a client certificate with administrative privilege to
   act on behalf of multiple IMAP users in the same connection via the
   EXTERNAL mechanism and the UNAUTHENTICATE command.

   Some server implementations using the imaps port will request and use
   a TLS client certificate to authenticate immediately as the default
   IMAP identity associated with that certificate.  These
   implementations indicate this behavior by using the PREAUTH greeting
   as indicated by transition 2 in the State Machine Diagram
   (Section 5).  As a result, TLS client certificates can not be used
   for administrative authentication with the imaps port unless the
   UNAUTHENTICATE command is also advertised.  In that case, an
   administrative client can respond to the PREAUTH greeting with an
   UNAUTHENTICATE command and then issue an AUTHENTICATE EXTERNAL
   command.

   6.  CLOSE, UNSELECT [RFC3691] or failed SELECT or EXAMINE command

   7.  UNAUTHENTICATE command

   8.  LOGOUT command, server shutdown, or connection closed


6.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) as described in [RFC5234].  Amended terms are defined in
   [RFC3501].

     capability     =/ "UNAUTHENTICATE"

     command-auth   =/ "UNAUTHENTICATE"

     command-select =/ "UNAUTHENTICATE"


7.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA shall add the UNAUTHENTICATE capability to the IMAP4
   Capabilities Registry.


8.  Security Considerations

   The original IMAP state machine was designed to allow a server
   implementation approach where each IMAP authentication identity
   matches an operating system identity and the server revokes all
   administrative privilege onces authentication completes.  This
   extension is not compatible with that implementation approach.
   However, that approach has significant performance costs on Unix
   systems, and this extension is designed for environments where
   efficiency is a relatively high priority deployment goal.  So this
   extension is appropriate for some deployments but may not be
   appropriate for the most security sensitive environments.

   IMAP server implementations are complicated and can retain a lot of
   state related to an authenticated user.  Server implementers need to
   take care to reset all server state such that authentication as a
   subsequent user does not inherit any data or privileges from the
   previous user.  State data associated with a user can include cached
   identity information such as group membership used to evaluate access
   control lists [RFC4314], active notifications [RFC5465], access to

   per-user data such as flags, etc.

   IMAP server systems are often deployed in a two-tier model where a
   server-side IMAP proxy routes to an IMAP back-end which handles all
   connections for a subset of possible users.  Some IMAP proxies enter
   a pass-through mode after authentication.  The UNAUTHENTICATE
   command, if enabled, would allow a client to bypass any security
   restrictions present in the proxy layer but not in the back-end
   server layer on a subsequent authentication.  As a result, IMAP
   server implementations of this extension MUST provide a way to
   disable it when it is not needed.  Use of an IMAP proxy that
   processes the UNAUTHENTICATE command at the proxy layer eliminates
   this concern.

Appendix A.  Design Considerations

   The author deliberately choose to add a separate UNAUTHENTICATE
   command instead of allowing the LOGIN or AUTHENTICATE commands to be
   issued when the connection is in a state other than unauthenticated
   state.  The primary reason for this choice is because the code that
   transitions from not authenticated state to authenticated state in a
   server is often the most security sensitive code as it needs to
   assume and handle unconditionally hostile attackers.  That sensitive
   code is simpler if it only handles a single server state

   (unauthenticated) and the state transition is as simple as possible.
   Smaller and simpler code is easier to audit and write in a secure
   way.

   A secondary reason to have a separate command is that it is simpler
   to enable or disable the feature with that design.  See the
   discussion in the security considerations section recommending
   implementations provide a way to disable this extension.
