1. Introduction

   DC Network Virtualization Overlay is driven by a desire of building
   a tenant IT application in a true virtual and secure environment
   [NVO3PRBM]. The NVO3 aims on a solution to group virtual hosts
   together in a true virtual environment that is decoupled from the
   physical network configuration. This decoupling not only speeds up
   the construction of IT applications and virtual Data Centers but
   also enables a new IT application. For example, allow the hot VM
   move from a server to another.

Internet-Draft             NVO3 and VPN Gap              September 2012


   Virtual and overlay network technology is not new. [RFC4364]
   [RFC4761] [RFC6325] The main differences between other overlay
   network technologies and NVO3 are 1) the client edge of the NVO3
   network may be individual virtualized hosts, not network sites or
   LANs; 2) the hosts and the network edge may be on the same server;
   3) the capability to support dynamic host placement and mobility.

   VPLS [RFC4761] [RFC4762] based L2VPN and BGP/MPLS L3VPN [RFC4364]
   have been widely deployed in Service Provider IP/MPLS networks to
   provide Layer 2 or Layer 3 virtual private networking for a
   customer. In fact, these VPN technologies have a lot of common
   characteristics that the NVO3 requires. These characteristics are:
   1) the capability to build many L2VPN and/or L3VPN instances on a
   common IP/MPLS backbone infrastructure; 2) to segregate the VPN
   traffic from other VPN's; 3) each VPN uses its own address space and
   the address is isolated from the infrastructure address space.
   Further both L2VPN and L3VPN solutions use the virtualization and
   encapsulation approach at the edge device, i.e. PE, to hide customer
   frames or packets and use a LSP tunnel transporting the
   frames/packets. This is very similar to the targeted NVO3 solution.
   Thus, it is useful to evaluate the L2VPN and L3VPN applicability for
   NVO3 and identify the protocol gaps between them. In addition, an
   NVO3 application may need to communicate with external users in a
   secured manner. The use of a traditional VPN to interconnect between
   a DC virtual network and enterprise networks [NVO3UCASE] remains the
   minimum changes in the enterprise networks and service provider
   networks. As a result the VPNs in a WAN may be necessary to support
   NVO3 features as well.

   This draft provides an analysis on NV03 requirements and L2VPN/L3VPN
   solutions/protocols and points out the gaps in between. The draft
   intends to stay in neutral on whether a new solution or the
   extension/simplification of the VPN solutions is right approach for
   NVO3.


2. Terminology

   This document uses the terminologies defined in [NVO3FRWK],
   [RFC4364].

3. IP/MPLS Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)

   IP/MPLS based VPLS and E-VPN [RFC4761][RFC4762][EVPN] and L3VPN
   [RFC4364] are developed for Wide-Area Networks. Both VPLS and L3VPN
   have been widely deployed in Service Provider WANs, MANs, and some



Yong & Hares            Expires March 10, 2013                 [Page 3]

   access networks. The E-VPN is still under development. These VPN
   solutions allow a Service Provider IP/MPLS backbone network provides
   a virtual private network in a WAN for a customer who has more than
   one network sites, i.e. the connectivity among customer network
   sites.  The architecture of L2VPN [RFC4664] and L3VPN are very
   similar. The three entities in the VPN architecture are CE, PE, and
   P. CE is the customer edge, representing a customer site. PE is the
   backbone network edge that connects to a customer CE via a physical
   interface. P is the backbone core node that does not connect to the
   customer site directly.

   The distinction between L2VPN and L3VPN is that an L2VPN routes and
   forwards on Ethernet MAC addresses while an L3VPN routes and forward
   on IP addresses. The VPLS solution uses the PW [RFC4448] for the
   transport between any pair of PEs; the L3VPN [RFC4364] and EVPN
   [EVPN] uses a MPLS LSP tunnel for the transport between any pair of
   PEs. Note that the PW in turn relies on a LSP tunnel for the
   transport as well. The VPLS uses data plane MAC learning at each PE
   to resolve the endpoint location. The L3VPN and EVPN uses iBGP
   protocol to disseminate customer IP and MAC address to the remote
   PEs. The L3VPN may use eBGP, OSPF [RFC4577], or others for the route
   population between CE-PE; EVPN uses data plane MAC learning at a PE
   customer facing interface. Both L2VPN and L3VPN solutions make the
   core node unaware of the VPN existence at PEs. Regarding auto
   discovery and configuration, the L3VPN and EVPN use the BGP
   protocols; the VPLS uses either LDP [RFC4762] or iBGP [RFC4761]
   protocol.

   Note that PW [RFC4448], L2TP [RFC5641], etc are often known as a
   L2VPN solution because they can transport Ethernet MAC frames
   between two points. This draft focuses on the analysis of VPLS, EVPN
   and L3VPN for the NVO3 and refers these two as L2VPN.

4. VPN for Network Virtualization Overlays

4.1. NVE Location

   One characteristics of NVO3 is the NVE location [NVO3FRWK]. There
   are two distinct cases. First an NVE resides on a server, i.e. TESs
   and NVE are on the same hardware. In this case, a server manager
   system is responsible to create NVE/VNs and VMs, and also
   responsible to assign a VM to a VN that has unique identification,
   then server software just makes it works properly and securely. A
   server itself may connect to the ToR as a host and DC physical
   network uses L3 network. This configuration is similar to Option B
   in RFC4363 [RFC4364]. Second an NVE resides on an external switch
   such as ToR. When a server manager creates a VM and adds the VM to a


Yong & Hares            Expires March 10, 2013                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             NVO3 and VPN Gap              September 2012


   VN on a local NVE, the server will send a notification of VM
   participation in the VN to the local NVE. In both cases, when a
   local NVE notices the new attached TES in a VN, it will announce the
   TES to remote NVEs [RFC4364] [EVPN] or to a mapping server via a
   control plane protocol [LISP].

   Traditional VPN architecture has PE and CE roles on different
   devices and two devices are connected via a wire (or more). In
   addition, PE and CE may be managed by different administration
   systems and serve as the service demarcation point. A CE is typical
   a network site (in L3VPN) or LANs (in L2VPN). PE is a Service
   Provider edge device.

   Although the VPN PE function is very similar to NVE, CE function is
   very different from NVO3 TES's from several aspects:

   o  PE and CE are on different hardware not on one. The provision
      process on CE and PE is done by different systems. TES/NVE in
      NV03 may be managed by one system.

   o  When CE is at a network site, a new end system is added into the
      site first, then this route is populated or learned by the PE.
      Thus the supporting of the dynamic changes of end-points is not
      critical to a VPN solution today due to the CE site network
      limitation to support that. However, in NVO3, a TES directly
      attaches to an NVE, the NVO3 solution has to support the dynamic
      change of TES.

   o  In L3VPN, the route population between PE and CE can be done by
      some control plane protocol such as eBGP, OSPF, etc. If an NVE is
      on a server, no need a control plane protocol between a TES and
      NVE; if an NVE is on an external switch, it may not be practical
      or efficient to run these protocols on every server as CE's. Thus
      NV03 may use a different protocol between an NVE and a server
      when the NVE is on an external switch.[ESYS] From the data plane
      perspective, L2VPN and L3VPN both can support virtual sub-
      interface on a wire.[RFC4761][EVPN][VRF-LITE]

   o  When an NVE is on a server, the server connects to one or more
      ToRs as a host, i.e. the server does not run any routing protocol
      but has a default gateway. DC physical network does not have any
      visibility of NVO3. See section 5.2.

4.2. VM Mobility

   Compute virtualization drives the need for network virtualization
   overlays, which lets closed user groups (CUG) to communication in a

Internet-Draft             NVO3 and VPN Gap              September 2012


   true virtual environment without considering physical network
   configuration. One BIG application for this is to enable dynamic VM
   placement and move without the change of VM IP and MAC address.
   Further the VM move has to be quickly enough so that the application
   does not get disrupted. This requires the NVO3 solution to
   differentiate a VM placement from a VM move. Both L2VPN and L3VPN
   solutions do not distinguish two actions and are not able to support
   a hot move. Further VM mobility adds the challenges for IP routing
   optimization [ISSUES].

   If the VM move is necessary across Data Centers [ISSUES], a
   traditional VPN solution also needs to support that. The BGP
   protocol supports sending a MAC withdraw message to allow a local PE
   to inform the remote PEs about its end-system removal. However, if a
   local PE can't detect the end-system removal quickly, this message
   may not be sufficient to insure the frame forwarding properly. For
   example, if a TES does not directly connect to a PE by a wire, the
   PE hardly syncs the state of TES when it moves. Another issue is
   when a VM moves, if its default gateway has no change, the traffic
   to/from the VM will still be routed through the same gateway entity,
   which is not optimized router. [ISSUES]

4.3. VNI on NVE

   NVO3 may apply to a large data center that may have hundred thousand
   servers and several millions of VMs. One NVO3 requirement is to be
   able to support a large number of virtual networks on a common data
   center infrastructure where each virtual network may be highly
   distributed in term of NVEs and spares TES per a NVE. To let each
   NVE maintain all the routes may lead a scalability issue for a
   server or a ToR switch. Considering a TES in a closed user group may
   rarely communicate with all other TESs at the same time, it is not
   necessary for an NVE to maintain all the routes at all the time.
   Some advanced control plane protocol and mechanism may fit better
   than traditional VPN control plane protocol for the route population
   between NVEs. [LISP]

4.4. Tunneling

   Traditional L2VPN and L3VPN are mainly implemented with the MPLS
   tunnels for transporting over the backbone network. Although the GRE
   tunnel [RFC4797] is technically feasible, the majority L2VPN and
   L3VPN deployments if not all use MPLS/LSP tunnel approach, i.e. one
   MPLS label (inner label) as the VPN identifier (or PW for VPLS) and
   one label (outer label) for MPLS/LSP tunnel. Thus core nodes, i.e. P
   nodes, are unaware of individual VPN instances. This implementation
   integrates the VPN solutions and the underlying MPLS network


Yong & Hares            Expires March 10, 2013                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft             NVO3 and VPN Gap              September 2012


   technology in one or another way. For example, the use of one label
   stack for the packet processing at PE and P, the traffic engineering
   capability, and MPLS trace [RFC4379] tools are able to track both
   inner and outer labels.

   NVO3 clearly requires the decoupling the overlay and underlying
   networking configuration. Further it has a high desirable to use IP
   tunnel instead of MPLS tunnel in a Data Center. Although the IP/GRE
   tunnel can apply to L2/L3 VPN solutions, the lack of the deployment
   in a real network may leave some unknown holes in the packet
   processing and management. For example, the IP/GRE tunnel approach
   aggregates the tunneled traffic in the underlying network, which may
   impacts the recovery and traffic optimization in the network. Thus a
   diligent study is necessary.

4.5. Auto Discovery

   Both L2VPN and L3VPN have auto discovery capability and use BGP
   protocol. The protocol can apply to the NVO3 if the same control
   plane protocol is used. However, if other route population protocol
   is used, NVO3 also needs the similar auto discovery capability.

4.6. Load Balancing

   Address in next version.

4.7. Broadcast and Multicast Traffic

   Address in next version.

4.8. Underlay Network Design

   DC underlay network design may be different from carrier WAN network
   design. DC physical networks have a common three tier architecture,
   ToR, aggregation switch and core switch plus DC gateway for the
   external connection. DC operator may not deploy any IGP in DC and
   just configure many ASes and use BGP protocol for the reachbility in
   DC physical networks [DCBGP] or use Open Flow design [ONF] instead
   of distributed control plane. This makes some challenges or new
   aspects for underlay network configuration and management,
   optimization, resiliency, and convergence. Although MPLS/BGP
   solution supports multi-ASes and allows a transit AS carrying a VPN
   seamlessly, the configuration is more complex than the VPN in single
   IGP. See section 5.2.

5. VPN for Inter DC Connectivity

   Today Service Provider VPN services are mainly used for
   interconnecting Enterprise DCs that are at different locations
   including DC providers. In this case, DC provider sites as the CE
   site and connect to Service Provider edge routers, i.e. PEs, via a
   physical wire. Typically an Ethernet Interface is used.

   Service provider may offer either a L2VPN [RFC4761][RFC4762] or
   L3VPN [RFC4364] service over the WANs to a customer. The service
   provides the connectivity among customer physical networks (port
   based) or virtual networks (sub-interface) at the locations. When
   using NVO3, one difference is that NVO3 uses the overlay for each VN
   instead of VLANs. In other words, on a DC provider infrastructure,
   there is one underlying network (physical) and many overlay networks
   (virtual). Following sections describe the VPN applicability for
   interconnecting such DC locations and potential enhancements to
   interwork with NVO3. Note that the description applies to both L2VPN
   and L3VPN unless it is stated explicitly.

5.1. Interconnecting DC Underlying Networks

   In this case, a Service Provider constructs a traditional VPN to
   interconnect multiple DC physical networks over the WANs for a DC
   customer. Then the DC customer may configure a NVO3 virtual network
   in multiple DCs in the same way as if configuring it in one DC
   without considering the VPN configuration at all.

   The DC physical networks and the VPN in the WANs together provide
   the underlying networking for an NVO3 virtual network. Two NVEs in
   the different DC locations can build one tunnel for NVO3 transport
   over DC networks and the VPN. The VPN transports the tunneled
   packets seamlessly across WANs and does not have the visibility of
   the end systems in each virtual network. The routes populated
   between a CE and PE are the DC underlying network routes only. The
   NVO3 functions such as auto discovery and VM mobility seamlessly
   work over the VPN. No change on the existing VPN solutions is
   necessary for this option. From the NVO3 perspective, it is
   completely decoupled from the VPN and is not aware of the VPN
   existence at all. When using BGP/MPLS VPNs, the eBGP interworks with
   DC control plane protocols such as OSPF or ISIS, which makes each DC
   network as individual islands from the control plane perspective.

   In the case that different DCs use different NVO3 solutions and
   require a gateway entity between two virtual networks, this option
   still works seamlessly. However the NVO3 control plane needs to
   address disseminating the end system locations across DCs


Yong & Hares            Expires March 10, 2013                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft             NVO3 and VPN Gap              September 2012


   [NVO3PRBM], which is discussed in next section. This is the
   interface protocol between oracle systems   Note that for an L3VPN
   configuration, the control plane in each DC site just peers with the
   local PE not a remote CE; For an L2VPN configuration, a Service
   Provider can configure the policy for L2CP BDUs at a PE based on the
   customer request. They can be either passed or discarded.

   It is worth to mention that there are other network solutions that
   support an overlay networking beside IP IGP technology. PBB [PBB] is
   L2 network solution; SPB [RFC6329] and TRILL [RFC6325] are L2
   network solution with IS-IS control plane.  Some DC operators may
   choose one of them for their data centers. The EVPN extensions such
   as [PBB-EVPN],[SPB-EVPN],[TRILL-EVPN] allow to interconnect DCs that
   use these solutions.

5.2. Interconnecting DC Overlay Networks

   In this case, a Service Provider constructs a VPN in the WANs to
   interconnect a particular NVO3 virtual network (i.e. a tenant
   virtual network that spans across multiple DCs). A sub-interface
   such as a VLAN between CE and PE can be used to identify the VN
   between the CE, e.g. DC Gateway Router, and the PE. Each DC builds a
   tunnel between a NVE and the DC Gateway Router for the transport
   within the DC. The VPN may use a MPLS/LSP tunnel between any pair of
   PEs in WANs. This option creates one NVO3 virtual network in each DC
   and one VPN over the WANs and stitches them together by a local VLAN
   between a CE and PE to form one tenant virtual network.

   The VPN in the WANs in this case only has the visibility of the VN
   in a DC. The VPN does not have the visibility of the DC physical
   network and other VNs in the DCs. The end systems in other DCs will
   appear as if associating with the DC Gateway Router in a DC. The VPN
   protocol extension may be necessary for the route population between
   CE and PE as well as among PEs. This is because 1) NVO3 may use a
   new control plane protocol that current VPN does not support. 2) The
   capability to support VM mobility. [ISSUES]

   Note that this option allows individual DCs to use the same or
   different NVO3 encapsulation schema. In fact, this option is very
   similar to Option A [RFC4364] except NVO3 implementation may differ.
   If DC operators want to construct an L2 VN within a data center but
   buy an L3VPN interconnect them, the NVE on the DC GW will perform
   the ARP function to resolve the IP/MAC mapping.

   If DC operators use eBGP and RR to disseminate the ES locations
   across DCs, it is possible to implement Option B and C [RFC4364]. In
   option B, the IP address of remote NVE in another DC is used in


Yong & Hares            Expires March 10, 2013                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft             NVO3 and VPN Gap              September 2012


   outer header, i.e. as the tunnel address. In option C, two tunnels
   are necessary. The inter tunnel is to the remote NVE; the outer
   tunnel is to the ASBR, which enables IGP routers to forward packets
   in IGP. In both cases, a WAN VPN (or Internet) has to connect DC
   physical networks first as mentioned in section 5.1. There is not a
   WAN VPN directly connecting to an overlay network in DC. It is
   interesting to note that two BGP separated control planes are used:
   one works with DC underlying network control plane and another is
   used for overlay network control plane.

   Note that no matter a VPN in a WAN connects to a DC underlying
   network or overlay network, a DC network never have the visibility
   to the WAN network, i.e. the VPN networking is decoupled from the
   IP/MPLS transport.

5.3. Interconnecting a DC VN and Enterprise Networks

   [NVO3UCASE] describes the needs and the different ways for a virtual
   network in a Data Center to communicate with external users. For a
   private cloud application, the use of a traditional VPN in a WAN to
   interconnect with a VN in DC provider site is desirable. The benefit
   of the traditional VPN is to leverage existing VPN usage or minimize
   the change on the VPN when the enterprise customer uses it to access
   a cloud service provided by a DC provider.

   Figure 1 below illustrates this scenario. Both enterprise A and B
   uses a Service Provider L3VPN services to interconnect its branch
   locations respectively. Note that the two VPN topologies may differ.
   Now each buys a virtual DC from a DC provider and wants the vDC to
   connect to their VPN supported by the Service Provider. In this
   case, the VPN service provider configures a VPN for each customer at
   the PE near to DC provider location, i.e. PE3 in Figure 1. The PE
   has a physical interface connecting DC Gateway Router (DCGR). The DC
   provider constructs an NVO3 based vDC for each enterprise customer.

       Figure 1 L3VPN for Enterprise and Provider DC Interconnection

   This configuration can be seen as the combination of section 5.1 and
   section 5.2. The VPN at PE1 and PE2 connects to the enterprise
   customer physical networks; while the VPN at PE3 connects to a DC
   provider NVO3 virtual network. Using option A [RFC4364], the VPN
   does not have the visibility of DC Provider physical network. The
   overlay tunnel terminates at the DCGR. Note that Option B and C may
   apply to this case with additional inter-tenant configuration. In
   addition, The VPN policy may be used for controlling routes and
   traffic in inter-tenant connectivity.

   This configuration provides the connectivity among the enterprise
   networks and its vDC in the DC provider location and isolates the
   VPN from the DC provider infrastructure, WAN infrastructure, as well
   as other virtual networks in the DC provider location. Note that it
   is possible that vDC span across multiple DC provider locations. One
   VPN can be used to interconnect them all.

   For this configuration, the VPN Service Provider has to work with
   both an enterprise customer and a DC provider to provision the VPN
   properly at each PE. The VPN protocol extension for this is the same
   as in section 5.2.

6. Operator Aspects

   The L2VPN and L3VPN were developed for a Metro or Wide Area Networks
   (MAN and WAN). The architecture model fits the Service Provider
   business model well and both are well-known services and have been
   deployed widely in Service Provider networks.

   The NVO3 is driven by DC operators for a quicker and easier
   constructing a tenant IT application in a Data Center. A tenant IT
   application requires the capability to form a virtual communication
   domain for a highly distributed closed user groups. The NVO3 has
   some common characteristics as VPN's such as virtualization and
   encapsulation but also has some unique characteristics such as 1)
   the same hardware for both switching and end-systems; 2) end-system
   mobility. In addition, DC operator aims on NVO3 potentials for
   supporting a new IT application.

   From the operation perspective, the NVO3 aims that the virtual hosts
   and NVE are managed by the same orchestration system and the
   underlying network is decoupled from the overlay network and may be
   managed by a different orchestration system. However, in the VPN
   operation model, PE and P, i.e. the VPNs and underlying networks,
   are managed by the same operators; CEs at the customer sites are
   managed by different operators and two has the provider-customer
   relationship. Furthermore, the creation and remove NVE and VM
   placement and move in NVO3 could be very dynamic compared to the
   creation of a VPN on a PE. Thus, NVO3 needs a better auto
   provisioning software than the command-line interface for the
   provisioning.

   These distinct areas are significant enough for people to further
   study if we should develop a brand new technology for NVO3 or may
   evolve the VPN technologies for it and trade-offs in each. Note that
   any new IT application may also require WAN VPN technology
   enhancement at the same time anyway. For example, the VM mobility
   across DCs also requires the VPN on a WAN network to support that
   properly.

   It is important for DC operators and SP operators as well as the
   people from vendors to work together on the NVO3 solution. It would
   be ideal to make the future virtual and overlay networking
   technology seamlessly work in DC, WANs, and wireless networks.

7. Security Considerations

   The VPN protocol solutions provide the security capability for a
   customer and allow many VPN running on one common network
   infrastructure. However, the VPN does not have much way to protect
   the infrastructure network attacked by the VPN traffic except the
   rate limit at the PE. This approach may not apply to NVO3 due to the
   VM dynamical placement and move.

8. IANA Considerations

   The document does not require any IANA action.
