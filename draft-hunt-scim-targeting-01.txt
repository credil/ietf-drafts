Abstract

   The core SCIM 1.0 specification is intended to provide updates to a
   single cloud-based application. This extension specifies an extended
   API definition which allows a single SCIM endpoint to support updates
   to multiple cloud-based applications. These extensions enable network
   relationships such as proxy updates, and hub-to-hub-to-spoke
   relationships in addition to the hub-spoke relationship defined in
   the core SCIM 1.0 specification.

1  Introduction

   This specification extends the SCIM Protocol [draft-scim-api-00] and
   [draft-scim-core-schema-00] to enable a SCIM service endpoint to act
   as a 'gateway' to process requests intended for other connected cloud
   services called 'targets'. A gateway is essentially a proxy that
   front-ends one or more applications for the purpose of provisioning.
   The gateway may act as a simple proxy, or it may act as a hub storing
   data to be used directly or indirectly by other cloud systems. A
   'target' is a logical representation of a remotely connected system
   to be provision. Such a system may be in-turn, connected via SCIM or
   some other API supported by the gateway node. The targeting extension
   is intended to support all SCIM operations and layers on top of SCIM
   1.0.

   The target resource extensions allow requesting clients to make
   updates to entities within the gateway itself and additionally,
   updates to be routed by the gateway to specific target end-points.

   1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. Service Provider Types The following non-normative section describes
   3 different types of service providers to illustrate how SCIM
   Resource Targeting may be used. With resource targeting, SCIM service
   providers are broken into 3 types: Spoke, Hubs, and Gateways. Each
   service provider has different capabilities and are used together to
   form a complete provisioning infrastructure.

2.1 Spoke Service Provider A spoke service provider is a SCIM service
   provider where accounts are to be provisioned using the SCIM 1.0
   APIs. It usually represents a single logical repository of
   identities.

2.2 Hub Service Provider A hub service provider offers the same features
   of a spoke, but it can also provision resources to connected service
   providers known as "targets". A "target" is a SCIM service provider
   that implements SCIM protocol or another protocol in such a way that
   it appears to accept SCIM transactions. Resources stored in the hub
   can be associated with "target" provisioned resources through the use
   of a complex attribute "accountRefs" which links hub resources to
   resources in target service providers.  

2.3 Gateway Service Provider A gateway is similar to a SCIM hub except
   that it has no local repository and is therefore stateless. Typically
   a gateway is used as an architectural component to firewall direct
   access to individual SCIM Service Provider endpoints by allowing
   transactions to flow through a common gateway.

3.  Extended Resource API

   The SCIM protocol specifies well known endpoints and HTTP methods for
   managing Resources defined in the core schema such as User and Group
   resources. The core schema defines key Relative Resource URLs which
   can be used to perform SCIM operations.

   In addition to the endpoints defined in section 3 of [draft-scim-api-
   00], the following endpoints are defined:

3.1 Local Endpoints

   In SCIM 1.0, all operations are presumed to occur on the current end-
   point. SCIM Hub and Gateway servers have additional server endpoints
   that enable discovery of Target entities where transactions can be
   routed.

   /Targets
   [Operations: GET]
      Use in GET operations to retrieve a list of logical target
      entities available within the current SCIM server. The information
      can be used by the client to discover provisioning end-points
      accessible via the current SCIM service provider.

   /Targets/{target_id}
   [Operations: GET]
      Use in GET operations to retrieve information about a particular
      Target identified by {target_id}.


3.2 Targeted Operations

      Targeting extends the SCIM protocol so that SCIM operations can be
 


P. Hunt, et al.          Expires March 10, 2013                 [Page 4]

INTERNET DRAFT        draft-hunt-scim-targeting-01     September 6, 2012


      routed to a  logical server. Targeting adds a prefix to the
      endpoint path to all normal SCIM operations as follows.

   /Targets/{target_id}/{scim-endpoint-url}
   [Operations: All]
      This general pattern indicates that a transaction is to be routed
      to a target identified by {target_id}. {scim-endpoint-url} is any
      valid SCIM 1.0 relative endpoint URL. The routed operation MAY in
      turn be another SCIM protocol call. However it MAY ALSO be over a
      different protocol as long as it behaves within the hub or gateway
      as a SCIM operation.

      For example:
      /Targets/crm/Users/2819c223-7f76-453a-919d-413861904646

   /Targets/{target_id}/ServerProviderConfigs
   [Operations: Get]
      Retrieves the service provider configuration of the target
      identified by the logical target identifier {target_id}. Included
      in the server configuration MAY be the 'type' attribute which
      specifies the server type of 'spoke', 'gateway', or 'hub' and
      defaults to 'spoke'. If target communication is not via SCIM, the
      target 'connector' should behave as if it was. The
      ServerProviderConfig returned SHOULD reflect the real SCIM
      endpoint configuration, or the equivalent if SCIM protocol is not
      used to connect the Target Service Provider.

   /Targets/{target_id}/Schemas
   [Operations: Get]
      Retrieves the targeted service provider's schema. The schema
      returned should reflect the Target Service Provider's schema or
      the equivalent if SCIM protocol is not used to connect the Target
      Service Provider.

   /Targets/{target_id}/Users
   /Targets/{target_id}/Groups
   [Operations: All]
      Retrieves/updates the User or Group entities from {target_id} as
      if the request was sent directly to {target_id}.

   /Targets/{target_id}/Users/{user_id}'
   [Operations: All]
      References the User entity {user_id} within the Target identified
      by {target_id}. 

   /Targets/{target_id}/Bulk
   [Operations: ALL]
      Perform bulk operations on a specified target service provider.

4 Schema

      To supported targeted operations, additional schema is defined to
      support new schema objects namely "targets" and to support
      extensions to User and Group objects. To support targeted
      operations, the SCIM schema is extended per section 4 of [draft-
      scim-core-schema-00].

      When extending schema to support targeting, the following URI MUST
      be added to the "schemas" attribute URI:
      'urn:scim:schemas:extension:targeted:1.0'.

4.1 Attributes (multi-valued)

   accountRefs  A complex multi-valued attribute containing references
      to associated resources in other targets. Each reference consists
      of a target identifier and a User object identifier. For each
      targetId, there may be one or more related object identifiers
      within each target. An individual identifier can be designated as
      a primary within a target.

4.2 SCIM Target Schema The Target extension provides a schema for
      representing the Service Provider's configured target entities
      identified using the following URI:
      'urn:scim:schemas:extension:targeted:1.0'.

      The Target Resource enables a Service Provider to expose the
      addressable targets reachable within the Service Provider as
      gatewayed entities. All attributes are READ-ONLY.

5 JSON Representation

5.1 User with Targeted References Representation

      The following is a non-normative example of a minimal SCIM
      representation of a User extended with targeted references in JSON
      format. The example user has 2 email accounts and one CRM account.
