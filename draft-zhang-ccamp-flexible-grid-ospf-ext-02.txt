    1. Introduction 

   [G.694.1] defines the Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) 
   frequency grids for Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) 
   applications.  A frequency grid is a reference set of frequencies 
   used to denote allowed nominal central frequencies that may be used 
   for defining applications.  The channel spacing is the frequency 
   spacing between two allowed nominal central frequencies. All of the

   wavelengths on a fiber should use different central frequencies and 
   occupy a fixed bandwidth of frequency. 

   Fixed grid channel spacing is selected from 12.5 GHz, 25 GHz, 50 GHz, 
   100 GHz and integer multiples of 100 GHz.  But [G.694.1] also 
   defines "flexible grids", also known as "flexi-grid".  The terms 
   "frequency slot" (i.e., the frequency range allocated to a specific 
   channel and unavailable to other channels within a flexible grid) 
   and "slot width" (i.e., the full width of a frequency slot in a 
   flexible grid) are used to define a flexible grid. 

   [FLEX-FWK] defines a framework and the associated control plane 
   requirements for the GMPLS based control of flexi-grid DWDM networks. 

   [RFC6163] provides a framework for GMPLS and Path Computation 
   Element (PCE) control of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks 
   (WSONs), and [WSON-OSPF] defines the requirements and OSPF-TE 
   extensions in support of GMPLS control of a WSON. 

   [FLEX-SIG] describes requirements and protocol extensions for 
   signaling to set up LSPs in networks that support the flexi-grid, 
   and this document complements [FLEX-SIG] by describing the 
   requirement and extensions for OSPF-TE routing in a flexi-grid 
   network. 

2. Terminology  

   For terminology related to flexi-grid, please consult [FLEX-FWK] and 
   [G.694.1]. 

2.1. Conventions Used in this Document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119]. 

   3. Requirements for Flexi-grid Routing  

   The architecture for establishing LSPs in a Spectrum Switched 
   optical Network (SSON) is described in [FLEX-FWK].  

   An flexi-LSP occupies a specific frequency slot, i.e. a range of 
   frequencies.  The process of computing a route and the allocation of 
   a frequency slot is referred to as RSA (Routing and Spectrum 
   Assignment).  [FLEX-FWK] describes three types of architectural 
   approaches to RSA: combined RSA; separated RSA; and distributed SA.  
   The first two approaches among them could be called "centralized SA" 
 
 
Zhang                  Expires December 2013                   [Page 3] 

draft-zhang-ccamp-flexible-grid-ospf-ext-02.txt               June 2013 
    

   because both routing and spectrum (frequency slot) assignment are 
   performed by centralized entity before the signaling procedure. 

   In the case of centralized SA, the assigned frequency slot is 
   specified in the Path message during LSP setup.  In the case of 
   distributed SA, the slot width of the flexi-grid LSP is specified in 
   the Path message, allowing the involved network elements to select 
   the frequency slot to be used. 

   If the capability of switching or converting the whole optical 
   spectrum allocated to an optical spectrum LSP is not available at 
   nodes along the path of the LSP, the LSP is subject to the Optical 
   "Spectrum Continuity Constraint", as described in [FLEX-FWK]. 

   The remainder of this section states the additional extensions on 
   the routing protocols in a flexi-grid network.  That is, the 
   additional information that must be collected and passed between 
   nodes in the network by the routing protocols in order to enable 
   correct path computation and signaling in support of LSPs within the 
   network.  

3.1. Available Frequency Ranges  

   In the case of flexi-grids, the central frequency steps from 193.1 
   THz with 6.25 GHz granularity. The calculation method of central 
   frequency and the frequency slot width of flexi-LSP are defined in 
   [G.694.1]. 

   On a DWDM link, the frequency slots must not overlap with each other.  
   However, the border frequencies of two frequency slots may be the 
   same frequency, i.e., the highest frequency of a frequency slot may 
   be the lowest frequency of the next frequency slot.  
    

                         Frequency Slot 1   Frequency Slot 2

                 Figure 1 - Two Frequency Slots on a Link

   Figure 1 shows two adjacent frequency slots on a link.  The highest 
   frequency of frequency slot 1 denoted by n=2 is the lowest frequency 
   of slot 2.  In this example, it means that the frequency range from 
   n=-2 to n=10 is occupied and is unavailable to other flexi-LSPs.  

   Hence, in order to clearly show which LSPs can be supported and what 
   frequency slots are unavailable, the available frequency ranges 
   should be advertised by the routing protocol for the flexi-grid DWDM 
   links.  A set of non-overlapping available frequency ranges should 
   be disseminated in order to allow efficient resource management of 
   flexi-grid DWDM links and RSA procedures which are described in 
   section 5.7 of [FLEX-FWK]. 

3.2. Application Compliance Considerations 

   As described in [G.694.1], devices or applications that make use of 
   the flexi-grid may not be capable of supporting every possible slot 
   width or position (i.e., central frequency).  In other words, 
   applications or implementations may be defined where only a subset 
   of the possible slot widths and positions are required to be 
   supported. 

   For example, an application could be defined where the nominal 
   central frequency granularity is 12.5 GHz (by only requiring values 
   of n that are even) and that only requires slot widths as a multiple 
   of 25 GHz (by only requiring values of m that are even).  

   Hence, in order to support all possible applications and 
   implementations the following information should be advertised for a 
   flexi-grid DWDM link:  

   o Central frequency granularity: a multiplier of 6.25 GHz. 

   o Slot width granularity: a multiplier of 12.5 GHz. 

   o Slot width range: two multipliers of 12.5GHz, each indicate the 
      minimal and maximal slot width supported by a port respectively.  

   The combination of slot width range and slot width granularity can 
   be used to determine the slot widths set supported by a port.  

3.3. Comparison with Fixed-grid DWDM Links  

   In the case of fixed-grid DWDM links, each wavelength has a pre-
   defined central frequency and each wavelength has the same frequency 
   range (i.e., there is a uniform channel spacing). Hence all the 
   wavelengths on a DWDM link can be identified uniquely simply by 
 
 
Zhang                  Expires December 2013                   [Page 5]

   giving it an identifier (such as the central wavelength [RFC6205]), 
   and the status of the wavelengths (available or not) can be 
   advertised through a routing protocol. 

   Figure 2 shows a link that supports a fixed-grid with 50 GHz channel 
   spacing.  The central frequencies of the wavelengths are pre-defined 
   by values of 'n' and each wavelength occupies a fixed 50 GHz 
   frequency range as described in [G.694.1].  

    
        W(-2)  |    W(-1)  |    W(0)   |    W(1)   |     W(2)  | 
   ...---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+----... 
         |   50 GHz  |  50 GHz   |  50 GHz   |   50 GHz  |  
    
       n=-2        n=-1        n=0         n=1         n=2               
   ...---+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+----------... 
                                 ^              
                    Central F = 193.1THz     
    
      Figure 2 - A Link Supports Fixed Wavelengths with 50 GHz Channel 
                                 Spacing 
    
   Unlike the fixed-grid DWDM links, on a flexi-grid DWDM link the slot 
   width of the frequency slot are flexible as described in section 2.1. 
   That is, the value of m in the formula is uncertain before a 
   frequency slot is actually allocated.  For this reason, the 
   available frequency slot/ranges need to be advertised for a flexi-
   grid DWDM link instead of the specific "wavelengths" that are 
   sufficient for a fixed-grid link. 

4. Extensions 

   As described in [FLEX-FWK], the network connectivity topology 
   constructed by the links/nodes and node capabilities are the same as 
   for WSON, and can be advertised by the GMPLS routing protocols 
   (refer to section 6.2 of [RFC6163]).  In the flexi-grid case, the 
   available frequency ranges instead of the specific "wavelengths" are 
   advertised for the link.  This section defines the GMPLS OSPF-TE 
   extensions in support of advertising the available frequency ranges 
   for flexi-grid DWDM links. 

4.1. Available Labels Set Sub-TLV  

   As described in section 3.1, the available frequency ranges other 
   than the available frequency slots should be advertised for the 
   flexi-grid DWDM links.  The label encoding defined in [FLEX-LBL] is

draft-zhang-ccamp-flexible-grid-ospf-ext-02.txt               June 2013 
    

   used to encode the label field in Available Labels Set sub-TLV [GEN-
   Encode]. 

4.1.1. Inclusive/Exclusive Label Range 

   The inclusive/exclusive label ranges format of the Available Labels 
   Set sub-TLV defined in [GEN-ENCODE] can be used for specifying the 
   frequency ranges of the flexi-grid DWDM links. 

   Note that multiple Available Labels Set sub-TLVs may be needed if 
   there are multiple discontinuous frequency ranges on a link. 

4.1.2. Inclusive/Exclusive Label Lists 

   The inclusive/exclusive label lists format of Available Labels Set 
   sub-TLV defined in [GEN-ENCODE] can be used for specifying the 
   available central frequencies of flexi-grid DWDM links.  

4.1.3. Bitmap 

   The bitmap format of Available Labels Set sub-TLV defined in [GEN-
   ENCODE] can be used for specifying the available central frequencies 
   of the flexi-grid DWDM links.  

   Each bit in the bit map represents a particular central frequency 
   with a value of 1/0 indicating whether the central frequency is in 
   the set or not.  Bit position zero represents the lowest central 
   frequency and corresponds to the base label, while each succeeding 
   bit position represents the next central frequency logically above 
   the previous.  

4.2. Extensions to Port Label Restriction sub-TLV 

   As described in Section 3.2, a port that supports flexi-grid may 
   support only a restricted subset of the full flexible grid.  The 
   Port Label Restriction sub-TLV is defined in [GEN-ENCODE] and [GEN-
   OSPF].  It can be used to describe the label restrictions on a port.  
   A new restriction type, the flexi-grid Restriction Type, is defined 
   here to specify the restrictions on a port to support flexi-grid.

   The symbol '+' represents the allowed nominal central frequency. The 
   symbol "--" represents a 6.25 GHz frequency unit.  The number on the

   formula (193.1 + n * 0.00625).  The nominal central frequency is 
   193.1 THz when n equals zero. 

   Assume that the central frequency granularity is 6.25GHz, the label 
   set can be encoded as follows:

   Inclusive Label Range:  

   o  Start Slot = -2;  
   o  End Slot = 8.  
    
   The available central frequencies (-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) can 
   be deduced by the Inclusive Label Range, because the Central 
   Frequency Granularity is 6.25 GHz.  

   Inclusive Label Lists:  

   o  List Entry 1 = slot -1;  
   o  List Entry 2 = slot 0;  
   o  List Entry 3 = slot 1;  
   o  List Entry 4 = slot 2;  
   o  List Entry 5 = slot 3;  
   o  List Entry 6 = slot 4;  
   o  List Entry 7 = slot 5;  
   o  List Entry 8 = slot 6;  
   o  List Entry 9 = slot 7.  
    
   Bitmap:  

   o  Base Slot = -1;  
   o  Bitmap = 111111111(padded out to a full multiple of 32 bits)  
    
    5. IANA Considerations 

   [GEN-OSPF] defines the Port label Restriction sub-TLV of OSPF TE 
   Link TLV.  It also creates a registry of values of the Restriction 
   Type field of that sub-TLV 

   IANA is requested to assign a new value from that registry as 
   follows: 

   Value    Meaning                    Reference 

   TBD      Flexi-grid restriction     [This.I-D] 

    6. Security Considerations 

   This document does not introduce any further security issues other
