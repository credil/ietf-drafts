1.  Introduction

   Autonomous System 0 is listed in the IANA Autonomous System Number
   Registry as "Reserved - May be use to identify non-routed networks"
   ([IANA.AS_Numbers]).

   [RFC6491] specifies that AS number zero in a ROA is used to mark an
   NLRI which is to be marked as Invalid.

   No clear statement that AS 0 was proscribed could be found in any BGP
   specification.

   As at least two implementations discard routes containing AS 0, and
   to allow approaches such as the above, this document codifies this
   behavior.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Behavior

   A BGP speaker MUST NOT originate or propagate a route with an AS
   number of zero in the AS_PATH, AS4_PATH, AGGREGATOR or AS4_AGGREGATOR
   attributes.

   An UPDATE message that contains the AS number of zero in the AS_PATH
   or AGGREGATOR attribute MUST be considered as malformed, and be
   handled by the procedures specified in [I-D.ietf-idr-error-handling].

   An UPDATE message that contains the AS number of zero in the AS4_PATH
   or AS4_AGGREGATOR attribute MUST be considered as malformed, and be
   handled by the procedures specified in [I-D.ietf-idr-rfc4893bis].

   If a BGP speaker receives zero as the peer AS in an OPEN message, it
   MUST abort the connection and send a NOTIFICATION with Error Code
   "OPEN Message Error" and subcode "Bad Peer AS" (see [RFC4271] Section
   6.2).  A router MUST NOT initiate a connection claiming to be AS
   number zero.

   Authors of future protocol extensions that carry the Autonomous
   System number are encouraged keep in mind that AS number zero is
   reserved and to provide clear direction on how to handle AS number
   zero.

3.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to update the Reference for number 0 in the
   "Autonomous System (AS) Numbers" registry to reference this document.


4.  Security Considerations

   By allowing a RPKI resource holder to issue a ROA saying that AS 0 is
   the only valid origin for a route, we allow them to state that a
   particular address resource is not in use.  By ensuring that all
   implementations that see AS 0 in a route ignore that route, we
   prevent a malicious party from announcing routes containing AS 0 in
   an attempt to hijack those resources.

   In addition, by standardizing the behavior upon reception of an
   AS_PATH (or AS4_PATH) containing AS 0, this document makes the
   behavior better defined, and security gotchas often lurk in the
   undefined spaces.

Appendix A.  Changes / Author Notes.

   [RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication ]

   Draft accepted as IDR Doc, notes reset.  Please see notes for
   draft-wkumari-idr-as0.xml for prior comments.

   Changes -00.

   o  Added AS4_PATH -- Robert Raszuk.
   o  Change "bgp listener" to "bgp speaker" -- Enke Chen
   o  Consistent use of AS_PATH (v., AS-PATH and AS PATH) -- Danny
      McPherson
   o  New text for Sec 2 P1 -- Enke / Keyur / Scudder,
      http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/idr/current/msg05786.html
   o  I made a boo boo -- I had the file open in 2 editors, made changes
      in one and overwrote them by saving on the "other, then checked
      the broken one into SVN.  Apologies to all whose comments I may
      have missed...

   Changes -01

   o  The WG thread
      http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/idr/current/msg05685.html
      showed a very strong preference for separating the error
      definition and handling -- the chairs also showed a prefernce to
      Publish this and point to the error handling that Enke will write.
   o  The originally suggested text ("An UPDATE message that contains
      the AS number of zero in the AS-PATH attribute MUST be...") only
      referenced the AS-PATH, readded AS4_PATH, *AGGREGATOR as suggested
      by Robert Raszak and Danny.

   Changes -02

   o  Fixed the reference for *AGGREGATOR.  This required breaking it
      out into two sentences / clauses.
   o  Added text on other places where an AS can show up (e.g: "4-Octet
      AS specific Extended Community" [5668]) -- thanks to Keyur.

   Changes - 03
   o  Removed text on other places where an AS can show up (e.g:
      "4-Octet AS specific Extended Community" [5668]).
   o  Added *very* generic "Authors of future protocol extensions..."
      text

   Changes -04

   o  Looks like the draft needs an 'Updates: RFC 4271' header.  Can you
      make the change? -- JGS.
   o  "You have things a bit scrambled in these two paragraphs" -- JGS
      (whoops!).
   o  Editorial: I suggest dropping the parentheses in...  JGS.
   o  Added "This document updates rfc 4271" to keep IDNITs happy...
   o  Bumped refs: draft-ietf-sidr-iana-objects has been published as
      RFC 6491, idr-error is now -01, 4893bis is now -06
