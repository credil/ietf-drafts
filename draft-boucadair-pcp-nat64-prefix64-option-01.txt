              draft-boucadair-pcp-nat64-prefix64-option-01

Abstract

   This document defines a new PCP Option/OpCode to learn the
   Prefix64(s) used by a PCP-controlled NAT64 device to build IPv4-
   embedded IPv6 addresses.  This Option/OpCode is needed for successful
   communications when IPv4 addresses are used in referrals (e.g., SIP).

Internet-Draft             PREFIX64 PCP Option            September 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a new PCP Option/OpCode [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] to
   inform PCP Clients about the Prefix64 [RFC6052] used by a PCP-
   controlled NAT64 device [RFC6146].

   This Option is required to help establishing communications between
   IPv6-only hosts and remote IPv4-hosts.  An illustration example is
   shown in Figure 1.  In this example, NAT64 is co-located with a PCP
   server while IPv6-only SIP UA interacts with a PCP Client.

   In Figure 1, the PCP Client issues a PCP MAP request with
   PORT_RESERVATION_OPTION to reserve a pair of ports preserving parity
   and contiguity [I-D.boucadair-pcp-rtp-rtcp].  A pair of ports and an
   external IPv4 address are then returned by the PCP server to the
   requesting PCP Client.  This information is used by the IPv6-only SIP
   UA to build its SDP offer which contains exclusively IPv4 addresses
   (especially in the "c=" line, the port indicated for media port is
   the external port assigned by the PCP server).  The INVITE request
   including the SDP offer is then forwarded by the NAT64 to the Proxy
   Server which will relay it to the called party (i.e., IPv4-only SIP
   UA) (Steps (1) to (3)).  IPv4-only SIP UA accepts the offer and sends
   back its SDP answer in a "200 OK" message which is relayed by the SIP
   Proxy Server and NAT64 until being delivered to IPv6-only SIP UA
   (Steps (4) to (6)).  At the end of this process, IPv4-only SIP UA can
   send media streams to the IPv4 address/port as indicated in the SDP
   offer while IPv6-only SIP UA can not send media streams as only IPv4
   addresses are present in the SDP answer.

   This issue is not specific to SIP but it is valid for all
   applications using IP addresses in referrals.  The option/OpCode
   defined in this document can be used in various schemes as listed
   below (the list is not exhaustive):

   o  For hosts with DNS64 capability, added to the host's stub-
      resolver.  The stub resolver on the host will try to obtain
      (native) AAAA records and if it they are not found, the DNS64
      function on the host will query for A records and then synthesizes
      AAAA records.  Using the PREFIX64 PCP Option, the host's stub-
      resolver can learn the prefix used for IPv6/IPv4 translator and
      synthesize AAAA records accordingly.

   o  As Peer-to-Peer (P2P) communications for real-time communication
      is becoming popular with RTCWEB (e.g., P2P for Media, data
      channels for file transfer etc), this option can be used to help
      for NAT64 traversal.  SIP is only one example among those
      protocols.

   o  Can be used for any application using referrals.

   A solution is proposed in Section 3.

      Allowed values are 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 12 [RFC6052].

   o  Prefix64: This field identifies the IPv6 unicast prefix to be used
      for constructing an IPv4-embedded IPv6 address from an IPv4
      address.  The address synthesize MUST follow the guidelines

Internet-Draft             PREFIX64 PCP Option            September 2012


3.2.  Behaviour

   A PCP Client MAY include a PREFIX64 PCP Option in a MAP request to
   learn the IPv6 prefix used by an upstream PCP-controlled NAT64
   device.  When enclosed in a MAP request, PREFIX64 MUST be set to
   ::/96.

   A PCP Server controlling a NAT64 SHOULD be configured to return the
   value of the Prefix64 used to build IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses to
   requesting PCP Clients.  When allowed, PREFIX64 PCP Option conveys
   the value of Prefix64.

   A PCP Server controlling a NAT64 SHOULD inject a PREFIX64 PCP Option
   in MAP responses even if the option is not listed in the associated
   request.

   Upon receipt of the PREFIX64 PCP Option, the host embedding the PCP
   Client uses Prefix64 for local address synthesize [RFC6052].

   A PCP Client SHOULD associate each received Prefix64 with the PCP
   Server from which the Prefix64 information was retrieved.


4.  GET_PREFIX64 OpCode

      Discussion: Both PREFIX64 option and OpCode are maintained in this
      version of the document.  Based on the WG inputs, both or only one
      of them will be maintained.

   This OpCode allows to retrieve the {IPv4 subnet, Prefix64::/n}
   mapping list (see Figure 3).  An IPv4 subnet is represented as "IPv4
   Address/IPv4 Prefix Length".  "Prefix64/IPv4 Prefix Count" indicates
   the count of {IPv4 subnet, Prefix64::/n} mappings.  This field MUST
   be set to 0 in a request and MUST be set to the number of included
   {IPv4 subnet, Prefix64::/n} mappings in a response.  IPv6 Prefix
   Length field indicates in bits the length of the Prefix64; allowed
   values are 32, 40, 48, 56, 64 and 96.  Prefix64 field MUST be set to
   ::/96 in a request and MUST be set to the value of the Prefix64 used
   to construct IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses for a given IPv4 subnet. a
   wildcard "IPv4 Address/IPv4 Prefix Length" means the associated
   Prefix64 is valid for any IPv4 address.

   In Steps (a) and (b), the IPv6-only SIP UA retrieves a pair of ports
   to be used for RTP/RTCP, the external IPv4 address and the Prefix64
   to be used to build IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses.  The retrieved IPv4
   address and port numbers are used to build the SDP offer in Step (1)
   while Prefix64 is used to construct a corresponding IPv6 address of
   the IPv4 address enclosed in the SDP answer made by the IPv4-only SIP
   UA (Step 6).  RTP/RTCP flows are exchanged between an IPv6-only SIP
   UA and an IPv4-only UA without requiring any ALG at the NAT64 and no
   particular function to be supported by the IPv4-only SIP Proxy Server
   to help establishing the session (e.g., Hosted NAT traversal).

   Now when the session is initiated from IPv4 SIP UA (see Figure 5):
   Steps (a) and (b), the IPv6-only SIP UA retrieves a pair of ports to
   be used for RTP/RTCP, the external IPv4 address and the Prefix64 to
   be used to build IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses.  These two steps can
   be delayed until receiving the INVITE message (Step 3).  It is

   session establishment delay.  The retrieved IPv4 address and port
   numbers are used to build the SDP answer in Step (4) while Prefix64
   is used to construct a corresponding IPv6 address of the IPv4 address
   enclosed in the SDP offer made by the IPv4-only SIP UA (Step 3).
   RTP/RTCP flows are exchanged between an IPv6-only SIP UA and an IPv4-
   only UA without requiring any ALG at the NAT64 and no particular
   function to be supported by the IPv4-only SIP Proxy Server to help
   establishing the session (e.g., Hosted NAT traversal).
