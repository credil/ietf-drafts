      <t>assessment
        <list>
          <t>Defined in <xref target="RFC5209"/> as "the process of collecting posture for a set of capabilities on the endpoint (e.g., host-based firewall) such that the appropriate validators may evaluate the posture against compliance policy."</t>
          <t>Within this document the use of the term is expanded to support other uses of collected posture (e.g. reporting, network enforcement, vulnerability detection, license management).  The phrase "set of capabilities on the endpoint" includes: hardware and software installed on the endpoint."</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      
      <t>asset
        <list>
          <t>Defined in <xref target="RFC4949"/> as "a system resource that is (a) required to be protected by an information system's security policy, (b) intended to be protected by a countermeasure, or (c) required for a system's mission.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>asset characterization

      </t> 

      <t>asset targeting
        <list>
          <t>Asset targeting is the use of asset identification and categorization information
            to drive human-directed, automated decision making for data collection and analysis in
            support of endpoint posture assessment.</t>

      </t>
      
      <t>attribute
        <list>
          <t>Defined in <xref target="RFC5209"/> as "data element including any requisite meta-data describing an observed, expected, or the operational status of an endpoint  feature (e.g., anti-virus software is currently in use)."</t>

      </t>
      
      <t>endpoint
        <list>
          <t>Defined in <xref target="RFC5209"/> as "any computing device that can be connected to a network. Such devices normally are associated with a particular link layer address before joining the network and potentially an IP address once on the network. This includes: laptops, desktops, servers, cell phones, or any device that may have an IP address."</t>
          <t>Network infrastructure devices (e.g. switches, routers, firewalls), which fit the definition, are also considered to be endpoints within this document.</t>
          <t>Based on the previous definition of an asset, an endpoint is a type of asset.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
       <t>Exposure
        <list>
          <t>An endpoint misconfiguration or software flaw that allows access to information or capabilities that can be used by an attacker as a means to compromise  an endpoint or network. (derived from CVE exposure definition)</t>
          <t>From RFC4949:

(I) A type of threat action whereby sensitive data is directly
      released to an unauthorized entity. (See: unauthorized
      disclosure.)

      Usage: This type of threat action includes the following subtypes:
      -  "Deliberate Exposure": Intentional release of sensitive data to
         an unauthorized entity.
      -  "Scavenging": Searching through data residue in a system to
         gain unauthorized knowledge of sensitive data.
      -  "Human error": /exposure/ Human action or inaction that
         unintentionally results in an entity gaining unauthorized
         knowledge of sensitive data. (Compare: corruption,
         incapacitation.)
      -  "Hardware or software error": /exposure/ System failure that
         unintentionally results in an entity gaining unauthorized
         knowledge of sensitive data. (Compare: corruption,
         incapacitation.)
</t>

        </list>
      </t> 
      <t>Misconfiguration
        <list>
          <t>A misconfiguration is a configuration setting that violates organizational security policies, introduces a possible security weakness in a system, or permits or causes unintended behavior that may impact the security posture of a system. (from NIST IR 7670)

The misalignment of a unit of endpoint configuration posture relative to organizational expectations that is subject to exploitation or misuse.
</t>
        </list>
      </t>
	  
      <t>posture
        <list>
          <t>Defined in <xref target="RFC5209"/> as "configuration and/or status of hardware or software on an endpoint as it pertains to an organization's security policy."</t>
          <t>This term is used within the scope of this document to represent the state information that is collected from an endpoint (e.g. software/hardware inventory, configuration settings).</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      
      <t>posture attributes
        <list>
          <t>Defined in <xref target="RFC5209"/> as "attributes describing the configuration or status (posture) of a feature of the endpoint.  For example, a Posture Attribute might describe the version of the operating system installed on the system."</t>
          <t>Within this document this term represents a specific assertion about endpoint state (e.g. configuration setting, installed software, hardware).  The phrase "features of the endpoint" refers to installed software or software components.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
	  	        <t>Remediation
        <list>
          <t>A remediation is defined as a security-related set of actions that results in a change to a computer's state and may consist of changes motivated by the need to enforce organizational security policies, address discovered vulnerabilities, or correct misconfigurations. (from NIST IR 7670)</t>
        </list>
      </t>
         <t>software flaw
        <list>
          <t>A weakness in software that is subject to exploitation or misuse. A software flaw can be used by an attacker to gain access to a system or network, and/or materially affect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information hosted by an endpoint or exchanged over a network. Such a flaw may allow an attacker to execute commands as another user, access data that is contrary to specified access controls, pose as another entity, or to conduct a denial of service. (derived from CVE vulnerability definition)</t>
        </list>
      </t>   
      <t>system resource
        <list>
          <t>Defined in <xref target="RFC4949"/> as "data contained in an information system; or a service provided by a system; or a system capacity, such as processing power or communication bandwidth; or an item of system equipment (i.e., hardware, firmware, software, or documentation); or a facility that houses system operations and equipment.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
	        <t>Vulnerability
        <list>
          <t>A vulnerability is a state of configuration or defect in a system which allows an unintended and unauthorized party to violate the security or policies of the system.</t>

<t>A weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that is subject to exploitation or misuse. This includes flaws in software and processes, and misconfiguration of hardware or software. (derived from NIST definitions)
</t>
<t>From RFC4949:

(I) A flaw or weakness in a system's design, implementation, or
      operation and management that could be exploited to violate the
      system's security policy. (See: harden.)

      Tutorial: A system can have three types of vulnerabilities: (a)
      vulnerabilities in design or specification; (b) vulnerabilities in
      implementation; and (c) vulnerabilities in operation and
      management. Most systems have one or more vulnerabilities, but
      this does not mean that the systems are too flawed to use. Not
      every threat results in an attack, and not every attack succeeds.
      Success depends on the degree of vulnerability, the strength of
      attacks, and the effectiveness of any countermeasures in use. If
      the attacks needed to exploit a vulnerability are very difficult
      to carry out, then the vulnerability may be tolerable. If the
      perceived benefit to an attacker is small, then even an easily
      exploited vulnerability may be tolerable. However, if the attacks
      are well understood and easily made, and if the vulnerable system
      is employed by a wide range of users, then it is likely that there
      will be enough motivation for someone to launch an attack.
</t>

        </list>
      </t>
	        <t>Vulnerability Management
        <list>
          <t>The process of mitigating the ability to exploit a vulnerability, via defect removal or protective measures such that exploitation becomes impossible or highly unlikely. (from Chris Inacio)
