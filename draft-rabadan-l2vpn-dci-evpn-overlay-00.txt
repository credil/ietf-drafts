              draft-rabadan-l2vpn-dci-evpn-overlay-00.txt

Abstract

   This document describes how Network Virtualization Overlay networks
   (NVO3) can be connected to a Wide Area Network (WAN) in order to
   extend the layer-2 connectivity required for some tenants. The
   solution will analyze the interaction between NVO3 networks running
   E-VPN and other technologies used in the WAN, such as VPLS/PBB-VPLS
   or E-VPN/PBB-EVPN.

Internet-Draft           DCI for E-VPN Overlays            July 15, 2013


1. Introduction

   [E-VPN-Overlays] discusses the use of E-VPN as the control plane for
   Network Virtualization Overlay (NVO) networks, where VXLAN, NVGRE or
   MPLS over GRE can be used as possible data plane encapsulation
   options.

   While this model provides a scalable and efficient multi-tenant
   solution within the Data Center, it might not be easily extended to
   the WAN in some cases due to the existing deployed technologies. For
   instance, a Service Provider might have an already deployed VPLS
   network that must be used to interconnect Data Centers.

   This document describes a Data Center Interconnect (DCI) solution for
   E-VPN overlay Data Center networks, assuming that the L2VPN
   technology deployed in the WAN can be based on:

   1. VPLS as defined in [RFC4761][RFC4762][RFC6074] or even PBB-VPLS,
      as defined in [PBB-VPLS]

   2. E-VPN as defined in [E-VPN]

   3. PBB-EVPN as defined in [PBB-EVPN]

   Each of these DCI models is analyzed in the following sections.




2. VPLS/PBB-VPLS based DCI for E-VPN overlay networks

   VPLS and PBB-VPLS are deployed in many Service Providers as the
   multi-point L2VPN service technology in the WAN. Those Service
   Providers will require integrating the new virtualized data center
   services with the L2VPN technology existing in the WAN, so that there
   is a minimum impact on the Service Provider operations.

   By implementing the Data Center Gateway (DC GW) functions described
   in this section, a Service Provider PE will be able to connect a DC
   tenant segment to an existing VPLS or PBB-VPLS service, for DC-to-DC
   layer-2 extension and for user-to-DC layer-2 connectivity.

                         Figure 1 VPLS DCI model

   In this model, the WAN Service Provider requires the use of its
   existing VPLS procedures to extend the layer-2 connectivity for the
   tenants. There are four potential options in this model:

   o VPLS DCI with VLAN-based hand-off

   o VPLS DCI with Pseudowire-based hand-off

   o VPLS DCI with integrated Gateway and WAN Edge functions

   o PBB-VPLS DCI

   Section 2.2 describes each specific option.

2.2. VPLS/PBB-VPLS DCI options

2.2.1. VPLS DCI with VLAN-based hand-off

   In this option, the hand-off between the DC GWs and the WAN Edge
   routers is based on 802.1Q VLANs. Each E-VPN Instance (EVI) in the DC
   GW is connected to a different VPLS Instance (VSI) in the WAN Edge
   router by using a different C-TAG VLAN ID or a different combination
   of S-TAG/C-TAG VLAN IDs that match at both sides. In this use-case,
   the WAN Edge router becomes a VPLS PE with regular VLAN-based
   Attachment Circuits.

Internet-Draft           DCI for E-VPN Overlays            July 15, 2013


   This option is required in those cases where the WAN and DC networks
   are operated by different entities and a secure demarcation between
   both is needed (no control plane protocols are run between DC GW and
   WAN Edge router, and each network can apply its own security and QoS
   policies independently based on the incoming/outgoing VLAN ID). The
   disadvantages of this model are the provisioning overhead and the
   reduced scalability (limited to the VLAN-ID space). The provisioning
   in the DC GWs can be automated though by the cloud management system.

   In this model, the DC GW acts as a regular Network Virtualization
   Edge (NVE) towards the D. Its control plane, data plane procedures
   and interactions are described in [E-VPN-Overlays]. From an E-VPN
   perspective, the connectivity to the WAN Edge routers is treated as
   VLAN-based service interfaces, therefore there is a 1:1 relation
   between DCI VLAN ID and EVI. If the data plane encapsulation in the
   NVO network supports VLAN tags in the encapsulated frames, a VLAN
   Bundle Service interface is possible in the DCI. As described in [E-
   VPN-Overlays] this interface type is possible if VXLAN is used and
   not for NVGRE. NVGRE only supports VLAN-based service interfaces.

   The WAN Edge router acts as a VPLS PE. Its functions are described in
   [RFC4761][RFC4762][RFC6074].

   The DC GW multi-homing functions for this model are described in
   section 2.6.

2.2.2. VPLS DCI with Pseudowire-based hand-off

   If MPLS can be enabled between the DC GW and the WAN Edge router, a
   more scalable DCI solution can be deployed. In this option the hand-
   off between both routers is based on FEC128-based pseudowires or,
   alternatively, FEC129-based pseudowires for a greater level of
   network automation. Note that this model still provides a clear
   demarcation boundary between DC and WAN, and security/QoS policies
   may be applied on a per pseudowire basis.

   In this model, besides the usual MPLS procedures between DC GW and
   WAN Edge router, the DC GW MUST support an interworking function in
   each EVI that requires extension to the WAN:

   o If a FEC128-based pseudowire is used between the EVI (DC GW) and
      the VSI (WAN Edge), the provisioning of the VCID for such
      pseudowire MUST be supported on the EVI and must match the VCID
      used in the peer VSI at the WAN Edge router.

   o If BGP Auto-discovery [RFC6074] and FEC129-based pseudowires are
      used between the DC GW EVI and the WAN Edge VSI, the provisioning
      of the VPLS-ID MUST be supported on the EVI and must match the

Internet-Draft           DCI for E-VPN Overlays            July 15, 2013


      VPLS-ID used in the WAN Edge VSI. Note that the Route
      Distinguisher (RD) and Route Target (RT) already provisioned for
      its use in E-VPN, can be re-used for VPLS. The WAN Edge VSI will
      have to be configured with two different RT extended communities.
      For example, if EVI-1 in DC GW-1 (figure 1) uses RT1, the peer WAN
      Edge VSI will use RT1 to import/export routes from/to the DC GW
      and RT2 to import/export routes from/to the remote WAN Edge VSIs.
      The WAN Edge router will import RT1 and RT2 in two different
      split-horizon groups, so that traffic to/from the DC GW can be
      switched to/from the WAN.

   The DC GW multi-homing functions for this model are described in
   section 2.6.

2.2.3. VPLS DCI with integrated Gateway and WAN Edge functions

   When the DC and the WAN are operated by the same administrative
   entity, the Service Provider can decide to integrate the DC GW and
   WAN Edge PE functions in the same router for obvious CAPEX and OPEX
   saving reasons. In the example depicted in figure 1 that would mean
   the WAN Edge routers would be P routers and will not maintain any
   tenant state. Note that this model does not provide an explicit
   demarcation between DC and WAN anymore, and ACLs or QoS policies
   between both networks become a very complex task.

   In this option, any EVI instance in the DC GW requiring layer-2
   extension to the WAN MUST support an interworking function to VPLS.
   The EVI will become a VSI from the WAN perspective and will setup a
   full mesh of pseudowires to all the remote PEs and DC GWs (except to
   the DC GW of its own DC) and according to the procedures described in
   [RFC4761][RFC4762][RFC6074].

   The DC GW multi-homing functions for this model are described in
   section 2.6.

2.2.4. PBB-VPLS DCI

   This case is a variation of the one described in section 2.2.3. When
   the DC GW and WAN Edge PE functions can be integrated, PBB-VPLS can
   also be used as the DCI technology of choice. In this case, the DC GW
   EVIs will become I-components multiplexed into a B-component that
   will be connected to the WAN.

   Since many EVIs can be multiplexed into the same B-component, this
   option provides significant savings in terms of pseudowires to be
   maintained in the WAN.

   The DC GW multi-homing functions for this model are described in

   section 2.6.



2.3. Unknown MAC route on the DC GWs

   The use of E-VPN, as the control plane of Network Virtualization
   Networks in the DC, brings a significant number of benefits as
   described in [E-VPN-Overlays]. There are however two potential issues
   that SHOULD be addressed when a VPLS DCI is used for a NVO3 DC:

   o All the MAC addresses learnt from the WAN side of the VSI must be
     advertised by BGP E-VPN updates. Even if optimized BGP techniques
     like RT-constraint are used, the amount of MAC addresses to
     advertise or withdraw (in case of failure) from the DC GWs can be
     difficult to control and overwhelming for the DC network,
     especially when the NVEs reside in the hypervisors.

   o As described in [E-VPN-Overlays], when the NVEs reside in the
     hypervisors, the E-VPN BGP routes and attributes associated with
     multi-homing are no longer required. The simple reason is the fact
     that, in a hypervisor environment, there is no need for multi-
     homing between VMs and NVEs since both, VMs and NVEs, are part of
     the same hardware. This reduces the required routes to be generated
     and processed to only two: the MAC Advertisement Route and the
     Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag Route. While this simplification
     greatly helps the implementation of E-VPN in the DC, it brings back
     some of the issues related to Multi-Homing that were solved by the
     removed procedures and that are still applicable for the specific
     use-case of the DC, since Multi-Homing is required at the DC GWs.

   The solution suggested in this document for the VPLS DCI use case is
   based on the use of an "Unknown MAC route" that is advertised by the
   two DC GWs. By using this Unknown MAC Route advertisement the user
   may optionally turn off the advertisement of WAN MAC addresses in the
   DC GW, hence reducing the control plane overhead and the size of the
   FDB tables in the NVEs. In addition to this, the Unknown MAC Route
   may provide a fast convergence solution valid for TORs and hypervisor
   NVEs, even if they do not support the Ethernet A-D route procedures.

   If this procedure is used, when an EVI is created in the DC GWs and
   the Designated Forwarder (DF) is elected, the DF will send a BGP
   update containing an "Unknown MAC" address. The Unknown MAC address
   will be conveyed in an "Unknown MAC" Advertisement Route:

                 +---------------------------------------+


   Where the ESI identifies the WAN Ethernet Segment, the VNI/VSID is
   encoded in the Ethernet Tag Field as explained in [E-VPN-Overlays],
   the MAC address length is set to 48 and the Unknown MAC address value
   will be set to 00:00:00:00:00:00. The IP address length will be zero,
   the IP address value omitted and the MPLS label will be set to zero.

   If the DC GW is DF for more than one ES within the same EVI, it will
   advertise an Unknown MAC route per ES, each one tagged with its
   corresponding ESI.

   As outlined before, there are two main functions that can be carried
   out by using this Unknown MAC Route: fast convergence for hypervisor
   NVEs (described in section 2.6.2.3) and disabling unknown unicast
   flooding in the DC (described in section 2.4).

2.4. Disabling unknown unicast flooding in a DC with VPLS DCI

   In DCs where MAC addresses are learnt through the control plane, the
   use of flooding for unknown destination MAC addresses can be
   disabled. However, when we use a VPLS DCI, the DC GW will normally
   learn the WAN MAC addresses in the data plane, therefore, even if the
   rest of the NVEs in the DC do control plane learning, disabling the
   unknown unicast flooding is no longer an administrative choice.

   The use of the Unknown MAC route in DC GWs allows two configuration
   options:

   a) Disable the unknown flooding in all the NVEs in the DC (except on
      the DC GWs) if Data Center MACs are learnt through the

   b) Disable the advertisement of the WAN MAC addresses from the DC
      GWs, so that the control plane overhead and the forwarding table
      sizes in the NVEs are both reduced.

   Both options SHOULD be an administrative configuration choice
   supported on the DC GWs.

   If option b) is enabled, the DC GW will advertise only the Unknown
   MAC Route for the EVIs on which it is the Designated Forwarder (DF).
   The NVEs will learn their local MACs through the control/management
   plane and advertise them in BGP. If any NVE receives a packet to an
   unknown destination MAC address, and option a) is enabled, the NVE
   will send the packet to the next-hop associated to the Unknown MAC
   Route (for each ESI if there is more than one), since the packet is
   assumed to be destined to the WAN. This assumption is valid since all
   the DC MACs are learnt in the control/management plane. The DC GW
   will receive the packet and will do an FDB lookup to find out what
   VPLS pseudowire or attachment circuit it has to send the packet to.
   If the destination MAC is unknown for the DC GW, it will flood the
   packet to the WAN, following standard VPLS procedures.

2.5. ARP-flooding control

   The use of the Unknown MAC route may eliminate the unknown flooding
   within the DC and provide an extra security protection mechanism
   against an excessive explosion of MAC addresses in the WAN that would
   trigger the advertisement of a significant number of MAC addresses in
   the DC.

   Another security mechanism, naturally provided by E-VPN in the DC
   GWs, is the Proxy ARP function. The DC GWs SHOULD build a Proxy ARP
   table with the IP and MAC address information coded in the MAC
   advertisement routes coming from the DC NVEs. When the active DC GW
   receives an ARP request coming from the WAN, the DC GW should check
   the Proxy ARP table for the EVI and reply to the ARP request as long
   as the information is available.

   This mechanism is specially recommended when VPLS DCI is used on the
   DC GWs since it protects the DC network from external ARP-flooding.

2.6. Multi-homing solution for VPLS DCI

2.6.1. Multi-homing solution requirements for VPLS DCI

   As it can be easily inferred from the scenario in figure 1, a multi-
   homing solution MUST be provided in the DC. The Multi-homing

Internet-Draft           DCI for E-VPN Overlays            July 15, 2013


   requirements on the DC GWs are listed here:

   o A Multi-homing solution MUST be supported by the DC GWs
     independently of the capabilities of the WAN Edge routers (since
     they can be managed by a different Service Provider).

   o The Multi-homing solution MUST support service-based (EVI) load-
     balancing. No flow-based load-balancing is required when VPLS DCI
     is used.

   o The Multi-homing solution MUST support single-active redundancy
     mode per E-VPN on the DC GWs, as per [E-VPN]. All-active multi-
     homing is neither possible if VPLS is used in the DCI nor required
     since the number of EVIs on the DC GWs is supposed to be large
     enough so that the traffic between DC and WAN can be fairly
     distributed.

2.6.2. Multi-homing solution description

   When the DCI model is the one described in the section 2.1, a single-
   active Multi-homing solution is required. Note that, since all-active
   Multi-homing is not required, only a subset of E-VPN routes and
   extended communities will be needed to be generated from the DC GWs:

   o Ethernet Segment route and ES-Import route target: required for the
     Ethernet Segment Auto-Discovery and Designated Forwarder (DF)
     election between the DC GWs. The DC GWs MUST generate an ES route
     per WAN network to which they are directly connected, and MUST be
     able to process the inbound ES routes as per [E-VPN].

   o Ethernet Auto-Discovery (A-D) route per ESI: required for fast
     convergence and back-up path. The DC GWs MUST generate an A-D route
     per ESI with an ESI Label extended community. The active-standby
     flag will be always set and the label field will be zero (no Split-
     Horizon procedures are required on the DC GWs as per [E-VPN]). The
     DC GWs will be able to process the received A-D routes per ESI.

   o Ethernet Auto-Discovery (A-D) route per EVI: the DC GWs will NOT
     generate A-D routes per EVI, since no aliasing functions are
     required for single-active Multi-homing. The DC GWs however MUST
     support processing A-D routes per EVI, since there might be some
     TORs in the DC supporting all-active Multi-homing.

   o MAC Advertisement route and MAC Mobility extended community: they
     MUST be supported at generation and reception as per [E-VPN-
     Overlays].

   o Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag route and PMSI Tunnel attribute:

Internet-Draft           DCI for E-VPN Overlays            July 15, 2013


     they MUST be supported at generation and reception as per [E-VPN-
     Overlays].

   The above routes and communities will be used for the following
   Multi-homing functions:

2.6.2.1. Multi-homed Ethernet Segment Auto-Discovery

   The DC GWs will advertise an Ethernet Segment route per WAN Ethernet
   Segment (ES), with the corresponding ES-Import extended community.
   There will be a single ESI per WAN network, i.e. DC GW1 and DC GW2
   will only advertise one ESI in the example of figure 1, and only the
   DC GWs of the DC will import the ES route for the WAN ESI, as per [E-
   VPN].

2.6.2.2. Designated Forwarder (DF) election and forwarding

   The DF election will be carried out as described in [E-VPN]. Service
   carving is recommended so that there can be per EVI load-balancing
   to/from the WAN. Assuming DC GW1 is elected as DF for a given EVI1,
   DC GW1 will be the only DC GW sending/receiving traffic to/from the
   WAN for EVI1. DC GW2 will block the transmission and reception of any
   traffic (including unicast and multi-destination traffic) to/from the
   WAN for EVI1.

   The use of OAM is recommended from the non-DF to the VPLS network, so
   that the VPLS PEs do not send any traffic to the non-DF DC GW for the
   EVI in which the DC GW is non-DF:

   o If the VPLS DCI solution is based on a VLAN hand-off,
     802.1ag/Y.1731 Ethernet-CFM can be used by the non-DF DC GW so that
     the peer WAN Edge router do not send any traffic to the DC GW for
     that particular EVI.

   o If the VPLS DCI solution is based on a pseudowire hand-off, the LDP
     PW Status bits TLV can be used by the non-DF to signal "Standby
     status" to the WAN Edge router for that particular EVI.

   o If the VPLS DCI is based on an integrated DC GW and WAN Edge router
     solution where the EVI is part of the VPLS full mesh of
     pseudowires, the non-DF DC GW can also make use of the LDP PW
     Status bits TLV to let the remote PEs know that it is not
     forwarding traffic for that EVI/VSI.

2.6.2.3. Fast Convergence using the Unknown MAC Route

   [E-VPN] proposes a Fast Convergence mechanism, so that when there is
   an ES failure on the DF router, the failover time can be uniform and
 


Rabadan et al.          Expires January 16, 2014               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft           DCI for E-VPN Overlays            July 15, 2013


   independent of the number of MACs and EVI services in the DC GWs.
   This is done by having the DC GWs advertising an A-D route per WAN
   Ethernet Segment. Upon a failure in connectivity to the WAN, the DF
   withdraws the Ethernet A-D route for the WAN Ethernet Segment so that
   the NVEs in the DC receiving the BGP withdraw can update their FDB
   for all the MAC addresses associated to the WAN ES.

   This mechanism is valid as long as the NVEs in the DC support the
   Ethernet A-D route per ESI. However, as described in [E-VPN-
   Overlays], in the Data Center there will be a mix of NVEs supporting
   Ethernet A-D routes (TORs with dual-homed servers) and NVEs NOT
   supporting Ethernet A-D routes (hypervisors), hence a complementary
   fast convergence mechanism is required for those.


   While the existing E-VPN Mass Withdraw procedure will be used for
   NVEs supporting the processing of Ethernet A-D routes, this document
   describes a complementary procedure for NVEs not supporting the
   processing of Ethernet A-D routes. The new procedure does not require
   the addition of any new route or extended community. It is just based
   on the interpretation of the Unknown MAC Route described in section
   2.3 which will be sent by the DC GWs in regular MAC advertisement
   routes. The user MAY decide whether the Unknown MAC Route procedure
   is used only by the hypervisors or by the hypervisors and the TORs
   too.

   Only one of the DC GWs will advertise the Unknown MAC Route per EVI
   and per WAN ESI. The DF will also advertise all the MAC addresses
   being learnt from the WAN Ethernet Segment (assuming option b in
   section 2.4 is not turned on). The hypervisor NVEs will import the
   Unknown MAC route as well as the rest of the WAN MAC addresses
   associated to the active DC GW. The Unknown MAC route is used by the
   active DC GW as a way of signaling that it owns the reachability to
   the WAN Ethernet Segment (ES) for a given EVI. The Unknown MAC
   address (00:...:00/48) conveyed in the Unknown MAC route will be
   added to the corresponding EVI forwarding table at the remote NVE.

   When the WAN Ethernet Segment active path fails (due to a port or
   link failure), the DC GW will withdraw the Unknown MAC route on all
   the EVIs for which it is the DF. This triggers all the hypervisor
   NVEs that receive the withdraw advertisement to immediately
   invalidate all the MAC addresses associated to the Ethernet Segment,
   as opposed to having to wait for each individual MAC to be withdrawn.

   This function is compatible with the E-VPN Fast Convergence procedure
   carried out by the use of the Ethernet A-D route. The Ethernet A-D
   route can still be used for TOR NVEs supporting all the E-VPN
   routes.

   Note that while the E-VPN mass withdraw provides a fast convergence
   mechanism independent of the number of services and MACs, the Unknown
   MAC withdraw provides a fast convergence mechanism per service,
   independent of the number of MACs in each service, i.e. convergence
   is not expected to be uniform for all the services, but uniform for
   all the hosts within a service. The use of the Unknown MAC route can
   significantly speed up the convergence in hypervisor NVEs, especially
   in services with a fair amount of MACs.   

3. E-VPN DCI for E-VPN overlay networks

   Another potential DCI technology that can be used in the WAN is E-
   VPN. Assuming E-VPN for MPLS tunnels is used in the WAN, the use of a
   DC GW is required if the overlay tunneling technology deployed within
   the DC is not MPLS over GRE, i.e. if VXLAN or NVGRE are used.

   Figure 2 illustrates this E-VPN DCI model.

4. PBB-EVPN DCI for E-VPN overlay networks

   [PBB-EVPN] is yet another DCI option. It requires the use of DC GWs
   where the multiplexing of I-components into the B-component is
   carried out. E-VPN will run in both components.
