             Management Information Base for Load Balancers
                   draft-li-opsawg-loadbalance-mib-03

Abstract

   Load balancer is deployed widely in datacenter nowadays.  There is a
   requirement to build a unique LB network management system where two
   or more vendors' LB devices are used.  We propose the standard MIBs
   for unique NMS.

   Load balancer description is introduced at
   "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)".

   This memo defines an portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes a MIB module for load balance device.

Internet-Draft              Load Balancer MIB              November 2011


1.  Introduction

   Load balancer is deployed widely in datacenter nowadays.  There is a
   requirement to build a unique LB network management system where two
   or more vendors' LB devices are used.  We propose the standard MIBs
   for unique NMS.

   This document defines 5 MIB Modules which together support the
   configuration and monitoring of Load Balance device.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   [RFC2578] STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].


3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


4.  Structure of Load-Balance MIB objects

   The following subsections describe the purpose of each of the objects
   contained in the loadbalance-MIB.

   4.1.  Load balance Virtual Service Table

   Services provided by LB devices are virtual services.  Configured on
   an LB device, a virtual service is uniquely identified by virtual
   service IP address, service protocol, service mode,and service port
   number.  Access requests of users are sent to the LB device through a
   public or private network.  If matching the virtual service, the
   requests are distributed to real services by the LB device.

   4.2.  Load balance Real Service Table

Internet-Draft              Load Balancer MIB              November 2011


   Services provided by real servers are real services.  A real service
   can be a traditional FTP or HTTP service, and can also be a
   forwarding service in a generic sense.  For example, a real service
   in firewall load balancing is the packet forwarding path.

   4.3.  Load balance Real Service Group Table

   Server group----a real service group is a logical concept.  Servers
   can be classified into different groups according to the common
   attributes of these servers.  For example,servers can be classified
   into static storage server group and dynamic switching server group
   according to their functions; or they can be classified into music
   server group, video server group and picture server group according
   to the services they provide.

   4.4.  Load balance health checking Table

   Health monitoring allows an LB device to check the statuses of real
   servers or links, collect the corresponding information, and
   quarantine the servers or links that work abnormally.  Health
   monitoring can not only mark whether servers or links can work
   normally, but also can collect statistics of the response time of the
   servers or links for selecting servers or links.

   4.5.  Load balance Statistic Table

   The statistic for Virtual Service or Real Service session,
   transmission rate.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2'
   subtree and to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.
   When the assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace
   "XXX" (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to
   remove this note.
