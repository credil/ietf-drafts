               Update Notifications for Proxy Mobile IPv6
               draft-ietf-netext-update-notifications-03

Abstract

   This document specifies protocol enhancements for allowing the local
   mobility anchor in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain to asynchronously
   notify the mobile access gateway about changes related to a mobility
   session.  These update notifications are exchanged using a Mobility
   Header message type specifically designed for this purpose.

Internet-Draft            Update Notifications                  May 2013


1.  Introduction

   In some situations, there is a need for the local mobility anchor to
   send asynchronous notification messages to the mobile access gateway
   in the course of a mobility session.  In this context, 'Asynchronous
   messages' is used to mean messages that are not synchronous with the
   Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement messages of
   the base Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification [RFC5213].  The base Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 specification does not have a provision for this.

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] describes the protocol operations to
   maintain reachability and session persistence for a Mobile Node (MN)
   without the explicit participation from the mobile node in signaling
   operations at the Internet Protocol (IP) layer.  In order to
   facilitate such network-based mobility, the Proxy Mobile IPv6
   protocol defines a mobile access gateway (MAG), which acts as a proxy
   for the mobile node in Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275], and the local mobility
   anchor (LMA) which acts similar to a Home Agent.  The setup of the
   mobility session is initiated by the mobile access gateway by sending
   a Proxy Binding Update message and acknowledged by the local mobility
   anchor in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message.  Once the
   mobility session is set up for a given lifetime, the local mobility
   anchor has no mechanism to inform the mobile access gateway about
   changes to the mobility session or any parameters related to the
   mobility session.

   One such scenario where such a mechanism is needed is when the local
   mobility anchor wants to inform the mobile access gateway that it
   needs to re-register mobility session for a mobile node.  It is
   possible to achieve a similar effect by using a short lifetime for
   the mobility sessions but in several networks this results in an
   unacceptable, and mostly unnecessary, increase in the signaling load
   and overhead.  More suitable is to enable a demand-based signaling
   from the local mobility anchor to one or more mobile access gateways.
   Another example is when there is change in QoS policy
   [I-D.ietf-netext-pmip6-qos], or a IPv4 Traffic Offload Policy
   [RFC6909], for a mobility session, the local mobility anchor wants to
   request the mobile access gateway to perform re-registration of the
   mobility session and so it can obtain the updated policy.  While it
   is possible to use an existing mobility header type to enable LMA-
   initiated signaling to a MAG, for instance the Proxy Mobile IPv6
   Heartbeat message [RFC5847], or the Binding Revocation message
   [RFC5846], the existing messages do not provide the required
   semantics and cannot be used.

   This document defines a new mobility header message for allowing the
   local mobility anchor to send notification messages to the mobile
   access gateway and a corresponding mobility header message for the

   mobile access gateway to acknowledge the notification message.  The
   purpose of the notification message is two-fold: (1) enable the local
   mobility anchor to notify the mobile access gateway about the updated
   session parameters, (2) enable the local mobility anchor to request
   the mobile access gateway to re-negotiate the session parameters.

   Use Case 2: Consider a use case where the local mobility anchor wants
   to notify the updated session parameters to the mobile access
   gateway, for example, an updated QoS profile, or and updated IPv4
   Offload Policy.

4.  Message Formats

4.1.  Update Notification(UPN)

   The Update Notification is a mobility header message that has an MH
   Type value of <IANA-1>.  It is used by the local mobility anchor to
   notify the mobile access gateway that some parameters related to the
   mobility session have changed.

   The format of the Update Notification message is as follows:


   0                   1                   2                   3

   Sequence Number
      A 16-bit unsigned integer used by the local mobility anchor to
      identify the Update Notification Acknowledgement message.  This
      sequence number MUST be initialized to a random number and
      increased monotonically for subsequent messages.
   Notification Reason
      This 16-bit unsigned integer indicates the Notification reason
      code.  This code corresponding to the reason that caused the local
      mobility anchor to send the Update Notification to the mobile
      access gateway.  This field does not contain any structure and
      MUST be treated as an enumeration.  The following Notification
      Reason values are currently defined:
      0 -  Reserved
      1 -  FORCE-REREGISTRATION
      2 -  UPDATE-SESSION-PARAMETERS
   Re-Transmission Identifier (RT-Id)
      This 8-bit unsigned integer is the re-transmission identifier.
      Each time a Update Notification message is re-transmitted, the re-
      transmission identifier value is incremented.  The initial message
      will have a re-transmission identifier value of (0).  If that
      message is re-transmitted, the value is incremented by (1).  When
      the re-transmission value hits a maximum value of (255), the
      message is discarded.
   Acknowledgement Requested Flag (A-Flag)
      When this flag is set to a value of (1), it is an indication that
      the local mobility anchor is requesting the mobile access gateway
      to send a Update Notification Acknowledgement message.
   Reserved
      This field is unused for now.  The value MUST be initialized to 0
      by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.
   Mobility Options
      A variable-length field of such length that the complete Mobility
      Header is an integer multiple of 8 octets long.  This field
      contains zero or more TLV-encoded mobility options.  Any of the
      mobility header options can be included here.  The receiver MUST
      ignore and skip any options that it does not understand.  These
      mobility options are used by the mobile access gateway to identify
      the specific binding for which the Update Notification message is
      sent.

4.2.  Update Notification Acknowledgement(UPA)

   The Update Notification Acknowledgement is a mobility header message
   that has an MH Type value of <IANA-2>.  The mobile access gateway
   sends this message in order to acknowledge that it has received an
   Update Notification message with the A-flag set and to indicate the
   status after processing the message.

           Figure 4: Update Notification Acknowledgement Message

   Sequence Number
      A 16-bit unsigned integer copied from the Update Notification
      message.  This is used for matching the Update Notification
      Acknowledgement message to the Update Notification message.
   Status Code
      This 8-bit unsigned integer indicates the status code.  Specifies
      the result of the processing of the update notification message.
      The status codes between 0 and 127 signify successful processing
      of the Update Notification message and codes between 128 and 255
      signify that an error occurred during processing of the update
      notification message.  The following Status Code values are
      currently defined:
      0 -  Success
      129 -  FAILED-TO-UPDATE-SESSION-PARAMETERS
   Re-Transmission Identifier (RT-Id)
      A 8-bit unsigned integer copied from the Re-transmission
      identifier field of the Update Notification message.  It
      identifies the instance of the message for which the Update
      Notification Acknowledgement message is being sent.
   Reserved
      This field is unused for now.  The value MUST be initialized to 0
      by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Mobility Options
      A variable-length field of such length that the complete Mobility
      Header is an integer multiple of 8 octets long.  This field
      contains zero or more TLV-encoded mobility options.  Any of the
      mobility header options can be included here.  The receiver MUST
      ignore and skip any options that it does not understand.  These
      mobility options are used by the mobile access gateway to identify
      the specific binding for which the Update Notification
      Acknowledgement message is sent.


5.  LMA Considerations

   o  The local mobility anchor sends the Update Notification message in
      response to a condition that is specified in the Notification
      Reason field.  The Notification Reason field in the Update
      Notification message MUST be set to a specific value that
      identifies the reason for which the Update Notification message is
      being sent.  The Notification Reason based on the chosen value,
      may require a specific Action that the mobile access gateway needs
      to perform (Ex: Requiring Re-registration of a mobility session).
   o  The Update Notification message MAY contain a modified session
      parameters in the form of a mobility options (e.g.,: IPv4 Traffic
      Offload option, or a QoS option), so the mobile access gateway can
      apply them on the identified mobility session.
   o  For requesting an Acknowledgement message *and an indication about
      the result of processing the message* from the mobile access
      gateway for the Update Notification message, the A-flag in the
      Update Notification message MUST be set to a value of (1),
      otherwise it MUST be set to a value of (0).
   o  The Sequence Number field of the message MUST be initialized to a
      random number and increased monotonically for subsequent messages.
      If the message is a re-transmission of a previously sent message,
      then the sequence number value is not changed.
   o  The Re-transmission identifier field of the message MUST be set to
      a value of (0).  If the message is a re-transmission of a
      previously sent message, then the value is incremented by (1).
      When the re-transmission value hits a maximum value of (255), the
      message is discarded and the local mobility anchor MAY choose to
      send a new Update Notification message with a new Sequence Number.
   o  The Update Notification message MUST include either the Mobile
      Node Identifier option [RFC4283], or the Mobile Node Group
      Identifier Option [RFC6602].
      *  If the Mobile Node Identifier option is present, it indicates
         that the Update Notification message is sent for that specific
         mobility session.

Internet-Draft            Update Notifications                  May 2013


      *  If the Mobile Node Group Identifier option is present, it
         indicates that the Update Notification message is sent for the
         set of mobility sessions identified by the Group Identifier.
         The Group Identifier is negotiated as part of the initial
         PMIPv6 signaling.  If the Group Identifier value is set to a
         value of (1), it identifies the all the mobility sessions
         established between that local mobility anchor and the mobile
         access gateway.
   o  Considerations from Section 5.1 MUST be applied when sending the
      Update Notification message.

5.1.  Constructing the Update Notification Message

   The local mobility anchor when sending the Update Notification
   message to the mobile access gateway has to construct the message as
   specified below:

   o  When using IPv4 transport, the source address in the IPv4 header
      MUST be set to local mobility anchor's IPv4 address (IPv4-LMAA)
      and the destination address in the IPv4 header MUST be set to
      IPv4-Proxy-CoA of the mobile access gateway.  The Mobility Header
      (without the IPv6 header) containing the Update Notification
      message is encapsulated in UDP header with the destination port of
      5436 [RFC5844].  If IPsec ESP is used to protect signaling, the
      packet is processed using transport mode ESP.
   o  The format of the Update Notification message sent over IPv4 and
      protected using ESP is shown below:


       IPv4 header (src=IPv4-LMAA, dst=IPv4-Proxy-CoA)
         ESP header (in transport mode)
           UDP header (sport=5436, dport=5436)
             Mobility Header (Update Notification)
               (One or more Mobile Header Options)


   o  When using IPv6 transport, the source address in the IPv6 header
      MUST be set to local mobility anchor's IPv6 address (LMAA).  The
      destination address in the IPv6 header MUST be set to Proxy-CoA of
      the mobile access gateway.  The Mobility Header is part of the
      IPv6 headers.
   o  The format of the Update Notification message sent over IPv6 and
      protected using ESP is shown below:

           (One or more Mobile Header Options)


5.2.  Receiving the Update Notification Acknowledgement Message

   o  If the local mobility anchor does not receive an Update
      Notification Acknowledgement message from the mobile access
      gateway for the Update Notification message with the A-flag set,
      then the local mobility anchor SHOULD retransmit the message.
      When retransmitting an Update Notification message, the sequence
      number value MUST be reused from the original message that is
      being re-transmitted.  The retransmissions MUST use an exponential
      back-off process in which the timeout period is doubled upon each
      retransmission.
   o  When receiving a Update Notification Acknowledgement message, the
      local mobility anchor MUST verify the Mobility Header as described
      in Section 9.2. of [RFC6275].  If the packet is dropped due to
      failing of any of the Mobility Header test checks, the local
      mobility anchor MUST follow the processing rules as in Section 9.2
      of [RFC6275].
   o  Upon receiving the Update Notification Acknowledgement message,
      the local mobility anchor MUST verify that the received message is
      protected by the security association that is being used to
      protect the other signaling messages between those two peers.  For
      example, if the Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding
      Acknowledgement messages are protected using IPsec Security
      Association, then the Update Notification Acknowledgement message
      MUST have the IPsec protection with the same IPsec Security
      Association.
   o  If the local mobility anchor receives an Update Notification
      Acknowledgement message with a failure Status and the value of
      larger than 128, then it SHOULD log an error.
   o  If the sequence number in the received Update Notification
      Acknowledgement message does not match any of the Update
      Notification messages that the local mobility anchor sent, then
      the message MUST be discarded and the message should be logged.
   o  If the local mobility anchor receives an Update Notification
      Acknowledgement message from the mobile access gateway for the
      Update Notification message, which did not have the A-flag set,
      the local mobility anchor SHOULD process the received message in
      the same way as a requested acknowledgement.

6.1.  Receiving the Update Notification Message

   o  When receiving a Update Notification message, the mobile access
      gateway MUST verify the Mobility Header as described in Section
      9.2. of [RFC6275].  If the packet is dropped due to failing of any
      of the Mobility Header test checks, the mobile access gateway MUST
      follow the processing rules as in Section 9.2 of [RFC6275].
   o  If the mobile access gateway does not support the Update
      Notification message and does not recognize the MH type <IANA-1>,
      then it sends a Binding Error message with the Status field set to
      2 as described in [RFC6275].
   o  Upon receiving the Update Notification message, the mobile access
      gateway MUST verify that the received packet is protected by the
      security association that is being used to protect the other
      signaling messages between those two peers.  For example, if the
      Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement messages
      are protected using IPsec Security Association, then the Update
      Notification message MUST have the IPsec protection with the same
      IPsec Security Association.
   o  If the received Update Notification message is a re-transmission
      of a previously received message, identified by the Sequence
      Number and the Re-transmission identifier fields, then the mobile
      access gateway MUST NOT process the message.  However, if the (A)
      flag in the Update Notification message is set to a value (1),
      then the mobile access gateway MUST just send an Update
      Notification Acknowledgement message.
   o  Upon accepting the Update Notification message, the mobile access
      gateway MUST process the message and perform the actions based on
      the Notification Reason.
      *  If the (A) flag in the message is set to a value of (1), the
         mobile access gateway SHOULD first send an Update Notification
         Acknowledgement message and set the status code field according
         to the result of processing the Update Notification message.
      *  If the Notification Reason is set to a value of (1) "FORCE-
         REREGISTRATION", then the mobile access gateway SHOULD send a
         Proxy Binding Update message to the local mobility anchor and
         obtain the updated session parameters for that mobility
         session.
      *  If the Notification Reason is set to a value of (2) "UPDATE-
         SESSION-PARAMETERS", then the mobile access gateway SHOULD
         apply the session parameters that are obtained from the Update
         Notification message in the form of mobility options.
      *  For other Notification Reasons that are not reserved by this
         document, the processing required on the mobile access gateway
         is out of the scope for this document and will be specified for
         each Notification reason in the respective document.

   o  Considerations from Section 6.2 MUST be applied when sending the
      Update Notification Acknowledgement message.

6.2.  Constructing the Update Notification Acknowledgement Message

   The mobile access gateway when sending the Update Notification
   Acknowledgement message to the local mobility anchor has to construct
   the message as specified below:

   o  The Sequence Number MUST be the same as the sequence Number from
      the received Update Notification message.
   o  The status field of the Update Notification message MUST be set to
      a value that reflects the status of the processing of the Update
      Notification request.  The value of 0 (success), indicates that
      the handling of the Update Notification message was successful.
   o  The Update Notification Acknowledgement message MUST contain the
      Mobile Node Identifier option, copied from the Update Notification
      message.  Furthermore, the mobile access gateway MAY include other
      mobility header options.
   o  The source address in the IP header of the Update Notification
      Acknowledgement message MUST be set to the destination IP address
      of the received Update Notification message.
   o  The destination address in the IP header MUST be set to the source
      address of the received Update Notification message.
   o  If IPsec ESP is used to protect signaling, the packet is processed
      using transport mode ESP.
   o  The format of the Update Notification Acknowledgement message sent
      over IPv4 and protected using ESP is shown below:


       IPv4 header (src=IPv4-Proxy-CoA, dst=IPv4-LMAA)
         ESP header (in transport mode)
           UDP header (sport=5436, dport=5436)
             Mobility Header (Update Notification Acknowledgement)
               (One or more Mobile Header Options)


   o  The format of the Update Notification Acknowledgement message sent
      over IPv6 and protected using ESP is shown below:


       IPv6 header (src=LMAA, dst=Proxy-CoA )
         Mobility Header (Update Notification Acknowledgement)
         ESP header (in transport mode)
           (One or more Mobile Header Options)

7.  Security Considerations

   The Update Notification protocol described in this specification is
   for use between local mobility anchor and mobile access gateway.
   This specification defines two new mobility header messages, Update
   Notification and the Update Notification Acknowledgement messages.
   These mobility header messages are to be protected using the same
   security mechanism that is used for protecting the Proxy Mobile IPv6
   signaling messages exchanged between a given local mobility anchor
   and mobile access gateway.

   If IPsec is used, the IPsec security association that is used for
   protecting the Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement, also needs to be used for protecting Update
   Notification and the Update Notification Acknowledgement messages.
   The traffic selectors associated with the Security Policy Database
   (SPD) entry protecting Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement messages have to be extended to include the mobility
   header type values, <IANA-1> and <IANA-2>, allocated for Update
   Notification and Update Notification Acknowledgement messages.


8.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank Basavaraj Patil, Rajeev Koodli,
   Lionel Morand, and other members of the NETEXT working group for all
   the comments and discussions on the draft.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the following IANA actions.

   o  Action-1: This specification defines a new Mobility Header Type
      message, Update Notification.  This mobility header message is
      described in Section 4.1.  The type value <IANA-1> for this
      message needs to be allocated from the Mobility Header Types
      registry at http://www.iana.org/assignments/mobility-parameters.
      RFC Editor: Please replace <IANA-1> in Section 4.1 and Section 7
      with the assigned value, and update this section accordingly.
   o  Action-2: This specification defines a new Mobility Header Type
      message, Update Notification Acknowledgement.  This mobility
      header message is described in Section 4.2.  The type value
      <IANA-2> for this message needs to be allocated from the Mobility
      Header Types registry at
      http://www.iana.org/assignments/mobility-parameters.  RFC Editor:
      Please replace <IANA-2> in Section 4.2 and Section 7 with the
      assigned value, and update this section accordingly.

Internet-Draft            Update Notifications                  May 2013


   o  Action-3: This specification defines a new registry for
      Notification Reasons.  Its called, "Update Notification Reasons
      Registry".  The notification Reason is a field in the Update
      Notification message Section 4.1.  The number space for the
      Notification Reason field needs to be managed by IANA, under the
      Registry, Update Notification Reason Registry.  This specification
      reserves the following type values.  The allocation policy for
      this field is, "specification required".


   +=========================================================+
   | 0 | Reserved                                            |
   +===+=====================================================+
   | 1 | FORCE-REREGISTRATION                                |
   +===+=====================================================+
   | 2 | UPDATE-SESSION-PARAMETERS                           |
   +===+=====================================================+



   o  Action-4: This specification defines a new registry for Status.
      Its called, "Update Notification Acknowledgement Status Registry".
      The status is a field in the Update Notification Acknowledgement
      message Section 4.2.  The number space for the status field needs
      to be managed by IANA, under the Registry, Update Notification
      Status Registry.  This specification reserves the following type
      values.  The allocation policy for this field is, "specification
      required".  The status codes between 0 and 127 signify successful
      processing of the Update Notification message and codes between
      128 and 255 signify that an error occurred during processing of
      the Update Notification message.


   +=========================================================+
   | 0 | Success                                             |
   +===+=====================================================+
   |129| FAILED-TO-UPDATE-SESSION-PARAMETERS                 |
   +===+=====================================================+
