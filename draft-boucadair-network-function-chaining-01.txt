       Differentiated Network-Located Function Chaining Framework
              draft-boucadair-network-function-chaining-01

Abstract

   IP networks rely more and more on the combination of advanced
   functions (besides the basic routing and forwarding functions).  This
   document defines a solution to enforce Network-Located Function
   Chaining (NLFC) with minimum requirements on the underlying network.

   The proposed solution allows for Differentiated Forwarding
   (DiffForward): packets are classified at the entry point of an NLFC-
   enabled network, and are then forwarded on a per NLFC map basis.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  On the Proliferation of Network-Located Functions

   IP networks rely more and more on the combination of advanced
   functions (besides the basic routing and forwarding functions).
   Typical examples of such functions include firewall (e.g.,
   [RFC6092]), DPI (Deep Packet Inspection), LI (Lawful Intercept)
   module, NAT44 [RFC3022], NAT64 [RFC6146], DS-Lite AFTR [RFC6333],
   NPTv6 [RFC6296], HOST_ID injection, HTTP Header Enrichment function,
   TCP tweaking and optimization functions, transparent caching,
   charging function, load-balancer, etc.

   Such advanced functions are denoted NLF (Network-Located Function) in
   this document.

   The major concern is how to provide differentiated forwarding for
   packets entering a network enabling advanced network functions.
   Differentiation is ensured by tweaking the set of network functions
   to be invoked.  How to bind a packet to a forwarding plane is policy-
   based.

1.2.  Scope

   This document defines a framework to enforce Network-Located Function
   Chaining (NLFC) with minimum requirements on the underlying network.
   The proposed solution allows for Differentiated Forwarding
   (DiffForward): packets are classified at the entry point of an NLFC-
   enabled network, and are then forwarded on a per NLFC map basis.

   This document does not make any assumption on the deployment context.
   The proposed framework covers both fixed and mobile networks (e.g.,
   to rationalize the proliferation of advanced features at the Gi
   Interface [RFC6459]).

1.3.  Objectives

   The main objectives of the proposed framework are as follows:

Internet-Draft                    NLFC                         June 2013


   o  Efficiently master the chained activation of network-located
      functions, regardless of the underlying network topology and
      routing policies.
   o  Allow for differentiated packet forwarding by selecting the set of
      network-located functions to be invoked.
   o  Allow to easily change the chronology of the activation of
      network-located functions to be invoked.
   o  Allow to easily change the set of network-located functions to be
      invoked.
   o  Ease withdrawal of network-located functions and minimize any
      subsequent topology upgrade.
   o  Automate the overall process of generating and enforcing policies
      to accommodate a set of network connectivity objectives.

1.4.  Assumptions

   The following assumptions are made:

   o  Not all NLFs can be characterized with a standard definition in
      terms of technical description, detailed specification, etc.
   o  There is no global nor standard list of NLFs enabled in a given
      administrative domain.  The set of NLFs varies on a per deployment
      basis.
   o  There is no global nor standard NLF chaining logic.  The ordered
      set of NLFs that need to be activated to deliver a given
      connectivity service is specific to each administrative entity.
   o  The chaining of NLFs and the criteria to invoke some of them are
      local to each administrative entity that operates a connectivity
      network (also called administrative domain).
   o  NLF chaining logic and related policies should not be exposed
      outside a given administrative domain.
   o  Several NLF chaining logics can be simultaneously enforced within
      an administrative domain to meet business requirements.
   o  No assumption is made on how FIBs and RIBs of involved nodes are
      populated.
   o  How to bind the traffic to a given NLF chaining is policy-based.

1.5.  Rationale

   Given the assumptions listed in Section 1.4, the rationale of the
   framework is as follows:

   o  The framework separates the dynamic provisioning of required NLF
      functions from packet handling operations (e.g., forwarding
      decisions).
   o  NLFs are handled as black-boxes; the technical characterization of
      each NLF is not required.
   o  No IANA registry is required to store the list of NLFs.

Internet-Draft                    NLFC                         June 2013


   o  No IANA registry is required to store the NLF chaining candidates.
   o  No frozen NLF chaining is assumed.  The definition of NLF chains
      is an information that will be processed by the nodes that
      participate to the delivery of a network service.  The set of
      listed/chained NLF functions is generated by each administrative
      entity operating the network.
   o  NLF handling is policy-based: NLF chains can be updated or
      deleted, new NLFs can be added without any impact on existing
      NLFs, etc.  This design choice is compliant with the global
      framework discussed in [I-D.sin-sdnrg-sdn-approach].
   o  For the sake of efficiency, policy enforcement is automated (but
      the policies can be enforced using other methods).
   o  To minimize fragmentation, a minimal set of information needs to
      be signaled (possibly in data packets).
   o  Advanced features (e.g., load balancing objectives) are also
      policy-based.  Invoked enforcement points are not aware of such
      objectives.
   o  NLFs can be embedded in nodes that intervene in the transport
      service or be embedded in dedicated nodes (e.g., dedicated
      servers).  The decision to implement one of these two models is
      deployment-specific and it is orthogonal to the overall procedure.
   o  Multiple NLFC-enabled domains can be deployed within the same
      administrative domain.  Nodes are provisioned with the policy
      table of the NLFC-enabled domain they belong to.
   o  The overall consistency is ensured by the PDP.
   o  The PDP can be responsible to enforce other policies than the NLFC
      Policy Tables.

2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   o  DiffForward: refers to the differentiated forwarding procedure as
      specified in this document.

   o  NLF (Network-Located Function): refers to a function which is
      enabled in the network operated by an administrative entity.  NLF
      can be for example: firewall (e.g., [RFC6092]), DPI (Deep Packet
      Inspection), LI (Lawful Intercept) module, NAT44 [RFC3022], NAT64
      [RFC6146], DS-Lite AFTR [RFC6333], NPTv6 [RFC6296], HOST_ID
      injection, HTTP Header Enrichment function, TCP optimizer, load-
      balancer, etc.  This document does not make any assumption on the
      enabled NLFs.

   o  NLFC-enabled domain: denotes a network (or a region thereof) that
      implements DiffForward.

   o  NLF Identifier: is a unique identifier that identifies
      unambiguously a NLF within an NLFC-enabled domain.  NLF
      Identifiers are assigned, configured and managed by the
      administrative entity operating an NLFC-enabled domain.  NLF
      identifiers can be structured as strings; other formats can be
      used.  NLF Identifiers are not required to be globally unique nor
      be exposed to or used by another NLF-enabled domain.

   o  NLFC Map: refers to an ordered list of NLF identifiers.  Each NLFC
      Map is identified with a unique identifier called NLFC Map Index.

   o  NLFC Policy Table: is a table containing a list of NLFC Maps, NLFC
      classification rules and Locators for all NLF Nodes.  NLFC Policy
      Table may contain a default NLFC Map.

   o  NLFC Boundary Node (or Boundary Node): denotes a node that
      connects one NLFC-enabled domain to a node either located in
      another NLFC-enabled domain or in a domain that is NLFC-unaware.

   o  NLFC Egress Node (or Egress Node): denotes a NLFC Boundary Node
      that handles traffic which leaves the NLFC-enabled domain the
      Egress Node belongs to.

   o  NLFC Ingress Node (or Ingress Node): denotes a NLFC Boundary Node
      that handles traffic which enters the NLFC-enabled domain the
      ingress Node belongs to.

   o  NLF Node: denotes any node within an NLFC-enabled domain that
      embeds one or multiple NLFs.

   o  Legacy Node (Node for short): refers to any node that is not a NLF
      Node nor NLFC Boundary Node.  This node can be located within a
      NLFC-enabled domain or outside a NLFC-enabled domain.

   o  NLFC Classifier (or Classifier): an entity which classifies
      packets based on the content of packet headers according to
      classification rules defined in a NLFC Policy Table.  Packets are
      then marked with the corresponding NLFC Map Index.  NLFC
      Classifier is embedded in a NLFC Boundary Node.  An NLFC
      Classifier may be identified by a dedicated NLF Identifier.

3.1.  Assign NLF Identifiers

   The administrative entity that operates a NLFC-enabled domain
   maintains a local repository that lists the enabled NLFs.  This
   administrative entity assigns a unique NLF identifier for each NLF.

   NLF identifiers can be structured as strings or any other format.
   The main constraint on the format is that two NLFs MUST be assigned
   with different identifiers.  NLF identifiers are case-sensitive.

3.2.  NLF Locator

   A NLF may be embedded in one or several NLF Nodes.  The NLF locator
   is typically the IP address or the FQDN to reach a given NLF Node.

   The use of an IP address is RECOMMENDED to ovoid overloading NLF
   Nodes with name resolution capabilities.  Resolution capabilities
   (together with advanced traffic engineering functions) are supported
   by the PDP (Policy Decision Point).  In the rest of the document, we
   assume a NLF locator is structured as an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6).

   A NLF can be multi-instantiated; as such one or more locators may be
   bound to the same NLF.

3.3.  Building NLFC Maps

   Added-value services delivered to end-user rely on the invocation of
   several NLFs.  For each of these services, the administrative entity
   that operates an NLFC-enabled domain builds one or several NLFC Maps.
   Each of these maps characterizes the list of NLFs to be invoked with
   their exact invocation order.

   Each NLFC Map is unambiguously identified with a unique identifier
   called NLFC Map Index.  The NLFC Map Index MUST be expressible as an
   unsigned integer.

   Distinct chains can be applied for inbound and outbound traffic.  The
   direction of the traffic is not included as an attribute of the NLFC
   Map, but directionality may be implemented using two chains: i.e.,
   two NLFC Maps are installed in the NLFC Policy Table.  In such case,
   incoming packets are marked with Index_1 while outgoing packets will
   be forwarded according to a distinct NLFC Map identified with
   Index_2.

   An example of NLFC Map to handle IPv6 traffic destined to an IPv4
   remote server is defined as follows:

      {15, {IPv6_Firewall, HOST_ID_Inject, NAT64}}.

Internet-Draft                    NLFC                         June 2013


   To handle incoming packets destined to the same IPv6 host, the
   following NLFC Map can be defined:

      {10, {IPv4_Firewall, NAT64}}.

3.4.  Building NLFC Policy Tables

   A PDP (Policy Decision Point, [RFC2753]) is the central entity which
   is responsible for maintaining NLFC Policy Tables, and enforcing
   appropriate policies in NLF Nodes and NLFC Boundary Nodes (see Figure
   1).  Policy enforcement can be achieved using a variety of protocols
   (e.g., NETCONF [RFC6241]).

   One or multiple NLFC-enabled domains may be under the responsibility
   of the same PDP.  Delimiting the scope of each NLFC-enabled domain is
   under the responsibility of the administrative entity operating the
   network.

   The NLF Node MUST be provisioned with the following information:

   o  Local NLF Identifier(s): This information is required for an NLF
      to identify itself within an NLFC Map.
   o  List of NLFC Maps: The PDP may configure the full list (default
      mode) or only as subset of NLFC Maps in which the local NLF is
      involved (see Section 6.6).

      NLFC Maps in which the local NLF is involved (see Section 6.6).

   Likewise, the NLFC Boundary Node MUST be provisioned with the
   following information:

   o  List of NLFC Maps
   o  List of NLF Locators
   o  List of NLFC Map Classification Rules (see Section Section 4.2).

   In addition to the NLFC Policy Table, other NLF-specific policies can
   be installed by the PDP (e.g., configure distinct users profiles).

   Policies managed and stored by the PDP may be configured to the PDP
   manually or be triggered by dynamic means (e.g., AAA).

   In the event of any update (e.g., define a new NLFC Map, delete an
   NLFC Map, add a new NLF Locator, update classification policy), the
   PDP MUST enforce the updated policy configuration in all NLF Nodes
   and NLFC Boundary Nodes.

   Load-balancing among several NLF Nodes supporting the same NLF can be
   driven by the PDP.  Indeed, the PDP can generate multiple
   classification rules and NLFC Maps to meet load-balancing objectives.

   The processing of packets by the nodes that belong to a NLFC-enabled
   domain does not necessarily require any interaction with the PDP,
   depending on the nature of the NLF supported by the nodes and the
   corresponding policies to be enforced.  For example, traffic
   conditioning capabilities [RFC2475] are typical NLF functions that
   may require additional solicitation to the PDP for the NLF node to
   decide what to do with some out-of-profile traffic.

4.  Theory Of Operation

   The behavior of each node of a NLFC-enabled domain is specified in
   the following sections.  We assume that the provisioning operations
   discussed in Section 3 have succeeded.

4.1.  NLFC Boundary Node

   NLFC Boundary Nodes act both as a NLFC Ingress Node and as a NLFC
   Egress Node for the respective directions of the traffic.

   Traffic enters a NLFC-enabled domain at a NLFC Ingress Node
   (Section 4.3) and exists the domain at a NLFC Egress Node
   (Section 4.4).

4.2.  Classifier

Internet-Draft                    NLFC                         June 2013


   The NLFC Classifier classifies packets based on (some of) the
   contents of the packet header.  Concretely, it classifies packets
   based on the value of a combination of one or more header fields,
   such as source address, destination address, DS field, protocol ID,
   source port and destination port numbers, and any other information.

   Each NLFC Map Classification Rule MUST be bound to one single NLFC
   Map (i.e., the classification rule must include only one NLFC Map
   Index).

4.3.  NLFC Ingress Node

   When a packet is received through an interface of the NLFC Ingress
   Node that connects to the outside of the NLFC domain, the Ingress
   Node MUST:

   o  Inspect the received packet and strip any existing NLFC Map Index.
   o  Check if the received packet matches an existing classification
      rule (see Section 4.2).
   o  If no rule matches, forward the packet to the next hop according
      to legacy forwarding behavior (e.g., based upon the IP address
      conveyed in the DA field of the header).
   o  If a rule matches, proceed to the following:

      *  Retrieve the locator of the first NLF as indicated in the NLFC
         Map entry the rule matches.
      *  Check whether the corresponding NLF node is an immediate
         neighbor.

         +  If so, update the packet with the NLFC Map Index of NLFC Map
            entry it matches and then forward the packet to the
            corresponding NLF Node.
         +  If not, (1) encapsulate the original packet into a new one
            destined to the corresponding NLF node, (2) update the
            encapsulated packet with the NLFC Map Index of NLFC Map
            entry it matches, and (3) forward the packet to the next hop
            to reach the first NLF node.

   As a result of this process, the packet will be sent to an NLF Node
   or an Intermediate Node.

4.4.  NLFC Egress Node

   When a packet is received through an interface that connects the NLFC
   Egress Node to its NLFC domain, the Egress Node MUST:

   o  Strip any existing NLFC Map Index.
   o  Forward the packet according to legacy forwarding policies.

Internet-Draft                    NLFC                         June 2013


4.5.  NLF Node

   This section assumes the NLF Nodes does not embed a Classifier as
   discussed in Section 6.3.

   When a packet is received by a NLF Node, the latter MUST:

   o  Check if the packet conveys a NLFC Map Index.
   o  If no NLFC Map Index is included, forward the packet according to
      legacy forwarding policies.
   o  If the packet conveys a NLFC Map Index,

      *  Retrieve the corresponding NLFC Map from the NLFC Policy Table.
      *  Check if the local NLF Identifier is present in the NLFC Map:

         +  If not, forward the packet according to legacy forwarding
            policies.
         +  If so, the packet is decapsulated (if needed) and then
            presented as an input to the local NLF.  In case several
            NLFs are co-located in the same node, the packet is
            processed by all NLFs indicated in the NLFC Map. Once the
            packet is successfully handled by local NLF(s), the packet
            is forwarded to the next NLF Node in the list or to an
            intermediate node (if the local NLFC Node is the last
            element in the NLFC Map).  If the local NLF node is not the
            last one in the NLFC Map, it retrieves the next NLF Node
            from the list, retrieve its locator for the NLFC Policy
            Table, and forwards the packet to the next hop.  If the
            local NLF Node is the last element in the NLFC Map, it
            forwards the packet to the next hop according to legacy
            forwarding policies.

4.6.  Intermediate Nodes

   An Intermediate Node is any node that does not support any NLF
   function and which is located within a NLFC-enabled domain.

   No modification is required to intermediate nodes to handle incoming
   packets.  In particular, routing and forwarding are achieved using
   legacy procedures.

5.  Protocol Extensions?

   This section discusses two main protocol issues to be handled in
   order to deploy DiffForward.

5.1.  Transmit NLFC Map Index In a Packet




Boucadair, et al.       Expires December 30, 2013              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                    NLFC                         June 2013


5.1.1.  NLFC Map Index

   A NLFC Map Index is an integer that points to a NLFC Map.

   In order to avoid all nodes of a NLFC-enabled domain to be NLF-aware,
   this specification recommends to undertake classifiers at boundary
   nodes while intermediate nodes forward the packets according to the
   NLFC Map Index conveyed in the packet (NLF Node) or according to
   typical forwarding policies (any NLF-unaware node).

   An 8-bit field would be sufficient to accommodate deployment contexts
   with reasonable set of NLFC Maps.  A 16-bit (or 32-bit) field would
   provide a comfortable solution (e.g., to accommodate the requirement
   discussed in Section 6.2).

5.1.2.  Why Not SSR?

   Instead of injecting a Map Index, an alternate solution would be to
   use SSR IP option or any similar solution to indicate a loose or
   strict explicit route.  This alternative was not considered because
   of the negative impact on the processing and potential fragmentation
   issues.

   Injecting an 8-bit or even 16-bit field would minimize fragmentation
   issues.

5.1.3.  Where To Store NLFC Map Indexes In A Packet?

   NLFC Map Indexes can be conveyed in various locations of a packet:

   o  At L2 level
   o  Define a new IP option or a new IPv6 extension header
   o  Use IPv6 Flow Label
   o  Re-use an existing field (e.g., DS field)
   o  TCP option
   o  GRE Key
   o  Define a new shim
   o  Etc.

5.2.  Force the path to cross a NLF Node

   A NLFC Ingress Node or an NLF Node MUST be able to forward a packet
   matching an existing NLFC Map to a NLF Node.  The locator of the next
   NLF is retrieved from the NLFC Policy Table.  In case the next NLF
   Node in the list is not an immediate neighbor, a solution to force
   the packet to cross that NLF Node MUST be supported.  This document
   suggests the use of IP-in-IP encapsulation scheme.  Other tunneling
   solutions can be considered in the future.

6.  Deployment Considerations

6.1.  Generic Requirements

   The following deployment considerations should be taken into account:

   o  Avoid inducing severe path stretch compared to the path followed
      if no NLF is involved.
   o  Minimize path computation delays: due to enforcement of
      classification rules in all participating nodes, misconception of
      network-located function chaining, inappropriate choice of nodes
      elected to embed network-located functions, etc.
   o  Avoid NLF invocation loops: the design of NLF chainings should
      minimize as much as possible NLF invocation loops.  Note, means to
      prevent NLF loops may be enabled in each NLF Node (see
      Section 6.5).

6.2.  NLF Profiles

   Some NLFs may be provisioned with a set of local differentiated
   policies (denoted as profiles).  For example, an NLF realizing DPI
   may be configured to block Peer-to-Peer protocols for some group of
   users while authorize it for another group of users.

   The profile selection policy can be local to a NLF or be controlled
   by the PDP.  In the latter case, distinct NLF identifiers can be
   assigned for each profile.  Doing so, the PDP conveys to the NLF the
   profile to be enforced for received traffic.

6.3.  NLF Node is also a Classifier

   If NLF Nodes are also configured to behave as Classifiers, NLFC Map
   Index is not required to be explicitly signalled in each packet.
   Concretely, the NLFC Policy Table configured to the NLF Node includes
   also classification rules.  These classification rules are enforced
   to determine whether the local NLF must be involved.  If an incoming
   packet matches at least one classification rule pointing to an NLFC
   Map in which the NLF Identifier is listed, the NLF Node retrieves the
   next hop NLF from the NLF Map indicated in the classification rule,
   the packet is handled by the local NLF, and then the NLF Node
   forwards the packet to the next hop NLF.  If not, the packet is
   forwarded to the next hop following legacy forwarding behavior.

   Let consider the example shown in Figure 2.  The local NLF Node
   embeds NLFa.  After checking the classification rules and the NLFC
   Maps, the NLF Node concludes NLFa must be invoked only when a packet
   matches Rule 1 and Rule 3.  If a packet matches Rule 1, the next NLF
   is NLFc.  If a packet matches Rule 3, the next NLF is NLFh.

6.4.  Direct Adjacency

   NLF Nodes may be enabled in a NLFC-enabled domain so that each of
   them has a direct adjacency with other NLF Nodes.  In such
   configuration, no additional encapsulation scheme is needed to
   exchange traffic between these nodes.

6.5.  NLF Loops

   NLF Nodes use the NLFC Policy Table to detect whether the local NLF
   was already applied for the received packet (i.e., detect NLF Loop).
   The NLF Node MUST invoke the local NLF only if the packet is received
   from a NLFC Boundary Node or a NLF Node having an identifier listed
   before the local NLF in the NLF Map matched by the packet.  NLF Loop
   detection SHOULD be a configurable feature.

   Figure 3 shows an example of a NLFC Policy Table of a NLF Node
   embedding NLFa.  If we consider a packet, received from Locb, matches
   Rule 2.  NLFa must not be invoked because NLFb is listed after NLFa
   (see the NLFC Map list).  That packet will be forwarded without
   invoking NLFa.

6.6.  Lite NLFC Policy Table

   If NLF loop detection is not activated in an NLFC-enabled domain, the
   PDP may provision to underlying nodes a lite NLFC Policy Table.  Lite
   NLFC Policy Table is a subset of the full NLFC Policy Table which
   includes:

   o  Only the NLFC Maps in which the local NLF is involved.
   o  Only the next hop NLF instead of the full NLF chain.

   An example of lite NLFC Policy Table is shown in Figure 4.

6.7.  Liveness Detection of NLFs by the PDP

   Determination by the PDP of liveness of each NLF in the service chain
   provides a number of benefits.  These include:

   o  Enhanced status reporting by the PDP (i.e., an operational status
      for any given chain derived from liveness state of its NLFs).

   o  Ability to support various resiliency policies (i.e., bypass NLF
      Node, use alternate NLF Node, use alternate chain, drop traffic,
      etc.) .
   o  Ability to support simple load balancing across multiple NLF
      instances that provide equivalent function (although more than
      liveness is required for complex load balancing schemes).

   In order to determine liveness of any particular NLF Node, standard
   protocols such as ICMP or BFD (both single-hop [RFC5881] and multi-
   hop [RFC5883]) may be utilized between the PDP and the NLF Nodes.

   For more sophisticated load-balancing support, protocols that allow
   for both liveness determination and the transfer of application-
   specific data, such as SNMP and NETCONF may be utilized between the
   PDP and the NLF Nodes.

   The support of this feature is OPTIONAL.

7.  IANA Considerations

   Required IANA actions will be discussed in future version of the
   document.

8.  Security Considerations

   Means to defend NLFC Boundary Nodes and NLF Nodes against broken NLFC
   Policy Table MUST be enabled.  For example, authenticated means are
   to be used between a PDP and the underlying NLFC elements.

   NLFC Boundary Nodes MUST strip any existing NLFC Map Index when
   handling an incoming packet.  A list of authorized NLFC Map Indexes
   are configured to the underlying NLFC elements.

   NETCONF-related security considerations are discussed in [RFC6146].

   Means to defend against denial-of-service must be supported.  Means
   to prevent NLF loops should be supported.

   Nodes involved in the same NLFC-enabled domain MUST be provisioned
   with the same NLFC Policy Table.  Inconsistencies in this tables will
   result in forwarding mis-behavior.
