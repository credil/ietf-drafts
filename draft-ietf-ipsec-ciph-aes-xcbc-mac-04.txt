A Message Authentication Code (MAC) is a key-dependent one way hash
function.  One popular way to construct a MAC algorithm is to use a
block cipher in conjunction with the Cipher-Block-Chaining (CBC) mode
of operation.  The classic CBC-MAC algorithm, while secure for
messages of a pre-selected fixed length, has been shown to be
insecure across messages of varying lengths such as the type found in
typical IP datagrams.  This memo specifies the use of AES in CBC mode
with a set of extensions to overcome this limitation.  This new
algorithm is named AES-XCBC-MAC-96.

This document is a product of the IPsec Working Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
