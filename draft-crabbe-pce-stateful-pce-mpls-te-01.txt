Internet-Draft  Stateful PCE extensions for MPLS-TE LSPs        May 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
   computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] describes a set of extensions to PCEP to
   provide stateful control.  This document describes the objects and
   TLVs to be used with these PCEP extensions to control Multiprotocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE
   LSP) via a stateful PCE.


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC5440]: PCC,
   PCE, PCEP Peer.

   This document uses the following terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] : Passive Stateful PCE, Active Stateful
   PCE, Delegation, Delegation Timeout Interval, LSP State Report, LSP
   Update Request, LSP Priority, LSP State Database, Revocation.

   Within this document, when describing PCE-PCE communications, the
   requesting PCE fills the role of a PCC.  This provides a saving in
   documentation without loss of function.

   The message formats in this document are specified using Routing
   Backus-Naur Format (RBNF) encoding as specified in [RFC5511].


3.  MPLS-TE specific descriptors used in PCEP Messages

   As defined in [RFC5440], a PCEP message consists of a common header
   followed by a variable-length body made of a set of objects that can
   be either mandatory or optional.  [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]
   describes the messages and objects needed in support of stateful PCE.
   The following sections contain MPLS-TE specific descriptors used in
   some of these messages.

3.1.  MPLS-TE specific descriptors for the PCRpt Message

   The format of the PCRpt message is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] as follows, and included here for easy
   reference:

Internet-Draft  Stateful PCE extensions for MPLS-TE LSPs        May 2013


      <PCRpt Message> ::= <Common Header>
                          <state-report-list>
   Where:

      <state-report-list> ::= <state-report>[<state-report-list>]

      <state-report> ::= <LSP>
                         [<path-list>]

   Where:

      <path-list>::=<path>[<path-list>]

   For MPLS-TE LSPs, the path descriptor is defined as follows:

      <path>::=<ERO><attribute-list>

   Where:

       <attribute-list> ::= [<LSPA>]
                            [<BANDWIDTH>]
                            [<RRO>]
                            [<metric-list>]

       <metric-list> ::= <METRIC>[<metric-list>]

   The LSP State Report MAY contain a path descriptor for the primary
   path and one or more path descriptors for backup paths.  A path
   descriptor MUST contain an ERO object as it was specified by a PCE or
   an operator.  A path descriptor MUST contain the RRO object if a
   primary or secondary LSP is set up along the path in the network.  A
   path descriptor MAY contain the LSPA, BANDWIDTH, and METRIC objects.
   The ERO,LSPA, BANDWIDTH, METRIC, and RRO objects are defined
   in[RFC5440].

3.2.  MPLS-TE specific descriptors for the PCUpd Message

   A Path Computation LSP Update Request message (also referred to as
   PCUpd message) is a PCEP message sent by a PCE to a PCC to update
   attributes of an LSP.  A PCUpd message can carry more than one LSP
   Update Request.  The Message-Type field of the PCEP common header for
   the PCUpd message is set to [TBD].

   The format of the PCUpd message is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] and included here for easy reference:

      <PCUpd Message> ::= <Common Header>
                          <udpate-request-list>
   Where:

      <update-request-list> ::= <update-request>[<update-request-list>]

      <update-request> ::= <LSP>
                           [<path-list>]

   Where:

      <path-list>::=<path>[<path-list>]

   For MPLS-TE LSPs, the endoding of path descriptor is defined as
   follows:

      <path>::=<ERO><attribute-list>

   Where:
      <path>::=<ERO><attribute-list>

   Where:

      <attribute-list> ::= [<LSPA>]
                           [<BANDWIDTH>]
                           [<metric-list>]

      <metric-list> ::= <METRIC>[<metric-list>]

   There is one mandatory object that MUST be included within each LSP
   Update Request in the PCUpd message: the LSP object (see
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]).  If the LSP object is missing, the
   receiving PCE MUST send a PCErr message with Error-type=6 (Mandatory
   Object missing) and Error-value=[TBD] (LSP object missing).

   The LSP Update Request MUST contain a path descriptor for the primary
   path, and MAY contain one or more path descriptors for backup paths.
   A path descriptor MUST contain an ERO object.  A path descriptor MAY
   further contain the BANDWIDTH, IRO, and METRIC objects.  The ERO,
   LSPA, BANDWIDTH, METRIC, and IRO objects are defined in [RFC5440].

   Each LSP Update Request results in a separate LSP setup operation at
   a PCC.  An LSP Update Request MUST contain all LSP parameters that a
   PCC wishes to set for the LSP.  A PCC MAY set missing parameters from
   locally configured defaults.  If the LSP specified the Update Request
   is already up, it will be re-signaled.  The PCC will use make-before-
   break whenever possible in the re-signaling operation.

Internet-Draft  Stateful PCE extensions for MPLS-TE LSPs        May 2013


   A PCC MUST respond with an LSP State Report to each LSP Update
   Request to indicate the resulting state of the LSP in the network.  A
   PCC MAY respond with multiple LSP State Reports to report LSP setup
   progress of a single LSP.

   If the rate of PCUpd messages sent to a PCC for the same target LSP
   exceeds the rate at which the PCC can signal LSPs into the network,
   the PCC MAY perform state compression and only re-signal the last
   modification in its queue.

   Note that a PCC MUST process all LSP Update Requests - for example,
   an LSP Update Request is sent when a PCE returns delegation or puts
   an LSP into non-operational state.  The protocol relies on TCP for
   message-level flow control.

   Note also that it's up to the PCE to handle inter-LSP dependencies;
   for example, if ordering of LSP set-ups is required, the PCE has to
   wait for an LSP State Report for a previous LSP before triggering the
   LSP setup of a next LSP.

3.3.  MPLS-TE specific encoding for the PCReq Message for stateful PCE

   A PCC MAY include the LSP object defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] in the PCReq message if the stateful PCE
   capability has been negotiated on a PCEP session between the PCC and
   a PCE.  The definition of the PCReq message (see [RFC5440], Section
   6.4) is then extended as follows:

                      [<LOAD-BALANCING>]

   Where:

      <metric-list>::=<METRIC>[<metric-list>]

3.4.  MPLS-TE specific encoding for the PCRep Message for stateful PCE

   A PCE MAY include the LSP object defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] in the PCRep message if the stateful PCE
   capability has been negotiated on a PCEP session between the PCC and
   the PCE and the LSP object was included in the corresponding PCReq
   message from the PCC.  The definition of the PCRep message (see
   [RFC5440], Section 6.5) is then extended as follows

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA actions to allocate code points for the
   protocol elements defined in this document.  Values shown here are
   suggested for use by IANA.

4.1.  PCEP-Error Object

   This document defines new Error-Type and Error-Value for the
   following new error conditions:

    Error-Type  Meaning
       6        Mandatory Object missing
                 Error-value=9:  ERO Object missing for a path in an LSP
                                 Update Request where TE-LSP setup is
                                 requested
                 Error-value=10: BANDWIDTH Object missing for a path in
                                 an LSP Update Request where TE-LSP
                                 setup is requested
