Abstract

   This document suggests guidance and principles for testing
   HTTP/2.0 implementations. Goals are to improve the HTTP/2.0
   specification by mitigating the potential ambiguity of the
   protocol specification and improving interoperability of its
   implementations.

1. Scope and Goals

   The scope of this document is to describe test framework and
   scenarios for client and server HTTP/2.0 implementations,
   primarily focusing on protocol compliance testing.

   Specific goals are:

  - Validate compliance with the HTTP/2.0 specification. Testing
     scenarios are derived from the protocol specification to ensure
     that implementations comply with all the "MUST", "MUST NOT",
     "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT" terms.
  - Assure consistency in interpretation of the HTTP/2.0 specification.
     Behaviors and responses are consistent among each implementations
     and expected functionalities and outcomes are the same across.
  - Improve the HTTP/2.0 specification. Uncover unclear terms or gaps
     in the protocol specification during test development.
     Interpretation of test results may provide insight to potential
     specification issues. Propose appropriate fix based on the issues
     to enhance the HTTP/2.0 Protocol usability.

   Areas that are out of scope:

  - Security testing
  - Performance testing
  - Stress testing
  - Interoperability testing with real world web sites



1.1. Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
   in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. Test Framework and Scenarios

2.1. Cross-Platform Support

  - Tests can be executed cross-platforms with consistent results. A
     consistent way of conveying results so that cross platform result
     carries the same meaning.
  - Tests are written with platform-independent programming language
     (for example, C/C++, Python)

2.2. Test Areas

   Test protocol compliance in terms of behaviors, boundary values, and
   error handling with interactions between client/server and
   intermediates.

2.2.1. Upgrade

2.2.2. Framing

2.2.3. Flow Control

2.2.4. Streams and Multiplexing

2.2.5. Header Compression

2.2.6. Connection Management

2.2.7. Stream Prioritization

2.2.8. Authentication

2.2.9. SSL Negotiation

2.2.10. Proxies

2.2.11. Server Push

2.2.12. Use of TLS

2.3. Test Results

   Pass/Fail test results strictly follows standards of protocol.

   -  Behaviors that violate the "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
     "SHALL", "SHALL NOT" terms of the HTTP/2.0 protocol will fail the
     tests

Internet-Draft             HTTP/2.0 Testing                May 2013


   -  Error handling results with side effects (i.e. crashes) will fail
     the tests

   -  Client/server which do not tolerate peers that follow "SHOULD",
     "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" behaviors will fail the tests

2.4. Test Organization

   -  Test cases should be logically structured and well grouped.
     Supports test selection based on feature area, for example, server
     push, upgrade, proxy, etc.

   -  Each test case must provide concrete descriptions and references
     to the IETF protocols

   -  Test cases should identify which version it supports, for example,
     HTTP-draft-06/2.0, HTTP/2.0, etc

   -  Test case name should be related to test scenarios and able to
     identify client/server side test

2.5. Reliability

   - Test cases should clean up and maintain the same environment after
     execution
   - Test cases yield the same results over time consistently

2.6. Diagnosis Ability

   - Test framework should support standard logging for after-test
     analysis
   - Logging should have different levels, for example, error level for
     protocol violation, warning level for potential interoperability
     problems,  trace level for debug
   - Logging should report corresponding error code returned during
     testing

2.7. Ease of Execution

   Test framework can be automated through command line tools, nice to
   have UIs.

2.8. Extensibility

   Test framework has modular structure and extensible for shared
   development. It can be added by different

   vendors/companies/organizations, that is, different people can
   collaborate on different test areas.
