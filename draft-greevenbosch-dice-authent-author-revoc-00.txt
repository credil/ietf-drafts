2.  Introduction

   This draft describes use cases and requirements for secure
   authentication, authorisation and revocation in the Internet of
   Things.  The draft has the following parts:

   o  The draft starts with several use cases.

Internet-Draft  Authentication, authorisation, revocation      July 2013


   o  A section with requirements related to the use-cases follows.

   o  Discussion of the various security trade-offs that need to be made
      can be found in Section 5.

   o  A table with some common attacks and associated protection, a
      conclusion and a recommendation is given in the "Conclusions"
      section.

   The draft illustrates the importance of these subjects, and aims at
   making sure these subjects are given proper attention in DICE.

3.  Use cases

3.1.  Discovered compromised device

   Company A has a certain type of actuators installed throughout its
   building.  On a certain time, some of these actuators start behaving
   funny.  It turns out that some hackers have been able to access the
   sensors, and drive them as they wish.

   Company A can't de-install the actuators immediately, after all, they
   are installed everywhere in the building.  Instead Company A has the
   actuators revoked, and then can replace them on a less hasty
   schedule.

3.2.  Unauthorised device

   Company B produces sensor devices.  These devices have known security
   issues, and therefore fail the certification requirements.

   Company C is oblivious of this fact, and since it needs this kind of
   sensors to monitor its industrial process, it buys some to test.

   During installation of the sensors into Company C's monitoring
   network, the credentials of the sensors are verified.  The
   authentication fails, and the installation of the sensors is aborted.
   The installation engineers are informed about the reason of failure.

   The sensor devices should never have been sold, as usage leads to
   potential danger.  Fortunately the authentication mechanism revealed
   that the sensors are not to be used.

3.3.  Revocation of unsafe devices

   Company D produces switches, that turn on or off connected
   peripherals.

   After a while, Company D finds out a problem with a particular series
   of its on/off switches.  It turns out that a certain vulnerability
   allows hackers to drive the switches.

   For legal and ethnic reasons, as Company D cannot guarantee the
   safety of its switches anymore, it has to to revoke the related
   series.

   In addition, Company D publishes its reasons for the revocation of
   the series and offers free replacement of the affected switches.

   In this example, there is not yet any adversary involved.  But since
   Company D found the vulnerability before havoc was wreaked, it was
   able to revoke the affected switches on time.  This eliminated a lot
   of potential trouble.

3.4.  Man-in-the-middle

   A classic attack.  In this scenario, we assume there is no secure
   authentication/authorisation mechanism.

   Alice has bought a device that she wants to connect to her network.
   When Alice starts installing, the message that delivers the key from
   the switch to Alice's gateway is intercepted by Mallory's
   intercepter.  Mallory replaces Alice's public key with his own public
   key A, and registers for Alice instead.

   In addition, Mallory impersonates his intercepter to be the gateway
   by sending Alice his public key B (which may or may not be equal to
   A).  From now on, Mallory can read and modify any communication
   between Alice's device and her gateway.

   Mallory is able to do this because neither the device of the gateway
   have means to authenticate the other party.  In addition, there is no
   mechanism saying that Mallory is not authorised to do the things he
   wants to do.

3.5.  Illegal smart-meters

   An electricity company depends on smart-meters to measure energy
   usage of the households it servers.  The gathered information is used
   for several purposes, billing being one of them.




Greevenbosch            Expires January 06, 2014                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft  Authentication, authorisation, revocation      July 2013


   On the black market, there appear illegal smart-meters that only
   report 75% of the actual electricity usage.  These smart-meters are
   based on a clone of a valid public key.

   Once the electricity company discovers this, it revokes the
   associated public key, thereby ensuring that the illegal meters
   cannot be installed anymore.

3.6.  Maintaining and extending a network of sensors and actuators

   An agricultural company uses an IP network to ensure an optimal
   climate for the vegetables they grow in their green houses.  Sensors
   do measurements about e.g. humidity and sunlight, whereas actuators
   can drive artificial rain and supporting light.  A central controller
   is responsible for processing the sensor readings and driving the
   actuators accordingly.

   Sometimes, a sensor or actuator needs replacement as part of the
   normal maintenance cycle.  This is a routine task for the associated
   engineer, and involves simply disconnecting the old apparatus and
   connecting a new one.  The rest of the installation to the network
   happens automatically.

   As the agricultural company is doing good business, it decides to
   expand.  It buys another piece of land, and modernises the green
   house that was already built on the land.  The modernisation includes
   installing new sensors and actuators, which are seamlessly integrated
   into the already existent network, such that they can work with the
   central controller too.

   The use case illustrates the need to be able to automatically install
   and update network nodes in an existing network.  It is also
   important to note, that installation of the network nodes includes
   proper authentication and authorisation.  After all, the agricultural
   company does not want outsiders to be able to influence the climate
   in the green houses, for example by driving the actuators or
   modifying the sensor readings.

3.7.  Vulnerability discovery in actuators in a chemical plant

   Company E maintains a chemical plant.  The plant deploys sensors for
   the several properties of the substance being produced, and actuators
   that start certain processes when the substance is ready for the next
   step.

   A vulnerability in certain of the actuators is discovered; it would
   allow unauthorised third parties to take over the actuators and start
   processes at their will.

Internet-Draft  Authentication, authorisation, revocation      July 2013


   After the discovery of the vulnerability, company E pro-actively de-
   activates the actuators and revokes their keys.  It then makes sure
   the vulnerability is resolved as quickly as possible, such that
   normal production can resume.

3.8.  Revocation of a non-compromised device

   Jack worked at the IT department of company E.

   However, due to a conflict with the company, Jack has been fired.
   When leaving, he smuggled out some tokens used to control several of
   the company's peripherals.

   When the company realises it misses the tokens, it revokes them to
   ensure they cannot be used to control the peripherals anymore.

   Jack fails to wreak havoc as his revenge, and neither can he sell the
   tokens to other adversaries.

3.9.  Mixing nodes from different vendors

   A weather analysis and forecast agency needs global coverage for
   collection of temperature and air-pressure data.  It has contracts
   with several local authorities and companies for the placement of
   their sensors.

   For both logistic and economic reasons, the weather agency does not
   want to rely on one particular type of sensor from a single vendor.
   Instead, it wants to allow different sensors from different vendors,
   as long as these sensors meet certain criteria concerning precision,
   response time and reliability.

   To ensure the criteria are met, the weather agency performs several
   tests with new candidate sensors.  When the sensors pass the tests,
   the agency allows their usage in its network.  When the sensors fail
   the tests, the agency is ensured that they cannot be used for
   collecting data, lest the quality of the agency's analysis and
   forecast suffer from data of bad quality.

   In this use case, the vendor pro-actively controls which sensor types
   can be used in their network.  It uses an authentication and
   authorisation mechanism to automatically ensure that only those types
   it has approved can be installed.  The use case illustrates the need
   for interoperability in authentication between nodes manifactured by
   different vendors, as well as the need to exclude nodes that are not
   authorised to join the network.

Internet-Draft  Authentication, authorisation, revocation      July 2013


4.  Requirements

   This section lists requirements for authentication, authorisation and
   revocation:

   1.   It SHALL be possible for a receiver to determine whether a key
        has been revoked.

   2.   It SHALL be possible to verify the binding between the key and
        the entity associated with it.

   3.   It SHALL be possible to verify whether an entity is authorised
        to establish the connection.

   4.   There SHALL be a mechanism that allows revocation of previously
        granted authorisation.

   5.   It SHALL be possible to perform authentication, authorisation
        and revocation verification fully automatically.

   6.   The verification technology MUST NOT require much complexity on
        constrained entities.

   7.   The verification mechanism SHALL be scalable, allowing
        potentially millions of entities to verify authentication and
        authorisation.

   8.   It SHOULD be possible to specify an expiry date for keys and/or
        authorisation.

   9.   It SHALL NOT be possible for an unauthorised third party to
        establish a cryptographic relationship.

   10.  It SHALL be possible to revoke compromised keys.

   11.  Revocation SHALL NOT require physically unplugging the device.

   12.  There SHALL be protection against an unauthorised third party
        authorising and revoking keys and entities.

5.  Discussion

   In this section, we discuss the various trade-offs that need to be
   made, and implications they may have.

5.1.  Certificate Authority

Internet-Draft  Authentication, authorisation, revocation      July 2013


   Much of a traditional Public Key Infrastructure depends on a
   certificate authority.  The certificate authority (CA) signs the
   certificate of the device, or an intermediate certificate that signs
   the certificate of the device.

   This creates islands of trust, in which the CA has the power to
   revoke any key on its island.  Interoperability between devices of
   different CAs may still be possible, depending on which CAs the
   entities trust apart from their own CA.

5.2.  Expiry

   X.509 certificates [X.509] contain an expiry date.  This means that
   the certificates automatically become invalid after a time has
   passed.  Should the device's lifetime be longer than the validity
   period of the certificate, then the certificate has to be updated.

   The expiry date has the advantage that there is no need to keep track
   of revoked certificates infinitely.  After the certificate's
   expiration, the revocation status can be forgotten.

   However a major draw-back is that a mechanism is needed to update
   expired certificates, provided that the entities holding them should
   continue to be used.

5.3.  Time of revocation

   Authentication and revocation are normally checked when two entities
   meet each other for the first time.  But how about entities that are
   to be revoked later?  The dealings with this highly depends on the
   security requirements of the employed system.  For example, home
   light-switches may have less stringent security requirements than
   actuators in a chemical plant.  In the former, a revocation mechanism
   for deployed devices may not be needed, whereas in the latter it is
   essential.

6.  Conclusions

   The following table gives an overview of various well-known attacks
   and applicable protection:

   +---------------------+----------------+---------------+------------+
   | Attack              | Authentication | Authorisation | Revocation |
   +---------------------+----------------+---------------+------------+
   | Man-in-the-middle   | Y              | Y             | Y          |
   |                     |                |               |            |
   | Unauthorised access | Y              | Y             | Y          |
   |                     |                |               |            |

   | Key compromise      |                |               | Y          |
   +---------------------+----------------+---------------+------------+


   Notice that a key compromise can allow both a man-in-the-middle
   attack and unauthorised access, hence the revocation requirement for
   all three attacks.

   The author of this draft believes that the given use-cases and
   requirements justify proper attention in DICE, and recommends
   including the following text into the charter:

   "The DICE working group will carefully consider the aspects of
   authentication, authorisation and revocation, and define or re-use
   related mechanisms where appropriate."
