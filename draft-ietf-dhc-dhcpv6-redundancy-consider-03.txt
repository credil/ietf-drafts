Internet-Draft      DHCPv6 Redundancy Considerations      September 2012


1.  Introduction

   Redundancy and high availability for many components of IPv6
   infrastructure are desirable and, in some deployments, mandatory.
   Unfortunately, for DHCPv6 there is currently no standards-based
   failover or redundancy protocol.  An interim solution is to provide
   semi-redundant services: this document specifies an architecture by
   which this can be achieved.


2.  Scope and Assumptions

   DHCPv6 redundancy may be useful in a wide range of scenarios.
   Although the architecture suggested in this document is able to be
   used in a wide range of networks, just two deployment environments
   are discussed here: service provider and enterprise network.  All
   other scenarios may be generalized to one of these two cases.

   In the rest of the document, the following assumptions are made with
   regards to the existing DHCPv6 infrastructure, regardless of the
   environment being considered:

   1.  At least two DHCPv6 servers provide a service to the same
       clients.  (The architecture does not limit the number of servers,
       and more may be provided if required.)

   2.  The existing DHCPv6 servers will not directly communicate or
       interact with one another in the assignment of IPv6 addresses and
       provision of configuration information to requesting clients.

   3.  DHCPv6 clients are instructed to run stateful DHCPv6 to request
       at least one IPv6 address.  Configuration information and other
       options (such as a delegated IPv6 prefix) may also be requested
       as part of the stateful DHCPv6 operation.

   4.  Clients participating in DHCPv6 configuration have to properly
       handle the preference option, including the processing of
       ADVERTISE messages, as required by [RFC3315].

   5.  A DHCPv6 server failure does not imply a failure of any other
       network service or protocol (e.g.  TFTP servers).  The redundancy
       of any additional services configured by means of DHCPv6 are
       outside the scope of this document.  (For example, a single
       DHCPv6 server may configure multiple TFTP servers, with
       preference for each TFTP server, as specified in [RFC5970].)

   While the techniques described in this document provide some aspects
   of redundancy, it should be noted that complete redundancy will not

   be available until a DHCPv6 failover protocol is standardized.  The
   requirements for such protocol are described in
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-failover-requirements].

2.1.  Applicability to Prefix Delegation

   The same approaches discussed in this document can potentially be
   applied to prefix delegation [RFC3633].  One obvious drawback of
   using split prefix model for PD is that use of resources is doubled.
   It should be noted that such applicability remains theoretical and
   was not investigated thoroughly during work on this document.  As
   such, the applicability of presented mechanisms to the prefix
   delegation is outside of scope of this document.


3.  Service Provider Deployment

   The service provider model represents cases where the network and
   end-user devices may be administered by separate entities.

   The DHCPv6 clients include cable modems, customer gateways or home
   routers, and end-user devices: these are collectively referred to as
   Customer Premises Equipment (CPE).  In some cases hosts may be
   configured directly using the service provider DHCPv6 infrastructure;
   in others, configuration may be via an intermediate router which is
   being configured by the provider DHCPv6 infrastructure.  Either way,
   the service provider DHCPv6 infrastructure may be semi-redundant.

   In discussing this environment, additional assumptions to those
   listed in Section 2 have been made:

   1.  The service provider edge routers and access routers (CMTS for
       cable or DSLAM/BRAS for DSL for example) are IPv6 enabled when
       required.

   2.  CPE devices are instructed to perform stateful DHCPv6 to request
       at least one IPv6 address, delegated prefix, and/or configuration
       information.  CPE devices may also be instructed to use stateless
       DHCPv6 [RFC3736] to acquire configuration information only, a
       situation that assumes the IPv6 address and prefix information
       has been acquired using other means.

   3.  The primary application of this architecture is for native IPv6
       services.  (Use and applicability to transition mechanisms is out
       of scope for this document.)

   4.  The CPE devices must implement a stateful DHCPv6 client
       [RFC3315].  Support for DHCPv6 prefix delegation [RFC3633] or



Brzozowski, et al.       Expires March 11, 2013                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft      DHCPv6 Redundancy Considerations      September 2012


       stateless DHCPv6 [RFC3736] may also be implemented.


4.  Enterprise Deployment

   The enterprise deployment environment covers cases where end-user
   devices are direct consumers of the configuration without any
   intermediate devices (as was the case with home routers used in the
   service provider environment).  Although enterprise IPv6 environments
   quite often use or require DHCPv6 relay agents, the relays do not
   influence or process the configuration in any way and merely act as a
   transport mechanism.

   The additional assumptions made for this model beyond those listed in
   Section 2 are:

   1.  DHCPv6 clients are hosts and are considered end nodes i.e. they
       consume provided configuration and not use it to provision other
       devices.  Examples of such clients include desktop computers,
       laptops, printers, other typical office equipment and some mobile
       devices.

   2.  The DHCPv6 clients generally do not require the assignment of an
       IPv6 prefix delegation and as such they typically do not support
       DHCPv6 prefix delegation [RFC3633].


5.  Protocol Requirements

   Implementation of the architecture for semi-redundant DHCPv6 services
   using existing protocols places require the component DHCPv6 clients,
   relays, and servers to have certain capabilities.  The following
   sections describe the requirements of such devices.

5.1.  DHCPv6 Servers

   This interim architecture requires the DHCPv6 servers that are
   [RFC3315] compliant and support the necessary options.  Essential to
   the architecture is support for stateful DHCPv6 and the DHCPv6
   preference option [RFC3315].  For deployment scenarios where IPv6
   prefix delegation is needed, DHCPv6 servers must support DHCPv6
   prefix delegation as defined by [RFC3633].  Furthermore, the DHCPv6
   servers must support [RFC3736] if stateless DHCPv6 is used.

5.2.  DHCPv6 Relays

   DHCPv6 relay agents must be [RFC3315] compliant and must support the
   ability to relay DHCPv6 messages to more than one destination.

Internet-Draft      DHCPv6 Redundancy Considerations      September 2012


5.3.  DHCPv6 Clients

   DHCPv6 clients are required to be compliant with [RFC3315] and
   support the necessary options required to support the solution
   depending on the mode of operations and desired behaviour:

   o  If prefix delegation is required, DHCPv6 clients must support
      DHCPv6 prefix delegation as defined in [RFC3633].

   o  Clients must support the acquisition of at least one IPv6 address
      and configuration information using stateful DHCPv6 as specified
      by [RFC3315].

   o  Stateless DHCPv6 [RFC3736] may also be supported.

   o  DHCPv6 clients must recognize and adhere to the processing of the
      advertised DHCPv6 preference options sent by the DHCPv6 servers.


6.  Deployment Models

   At the time of writing, a standards-based DHCPv6 redundancy protocol
   is not available.  In the interim solution presented here, existing
   DHCPv6 server implementations are used as-is to provide best effort,
   semi-redundant DHCPv6 services.  The behavior of these services will,
   in part, be governed by the configuration of each of the servers.
   Various aspects of the DHCPv6 protocol [RFC3315] are used to yield
   the desired behaviour, although there is no inter-server or inter-
   process communication to coordinate DHCPv6 events and/or activities.

   The solution does not impact on DHCPv4, so DHCP services for both
   IPv4 and IPv6 may operate simultaneously on the same physical
   server(s) or may operate on different ones.

   This section defines three semi-redundant models.  Although /64
   prefixes are used throughout the following sections as examples,
   other prefix lengths may be used as well.

6.1.  Split Prefixes

   In the split prefixes model, each DHCPv6 server is configured with a
   unique, non-overlapping pool derived from the /64 prefix deployed for
   use within an IPv6 network.  For example, distributing an allocated
   /64 such as 2001:db8:1:0001::/64 between two servers would require
   that it be split into two /65 pools, 2001:db8:1:0001:0000::/65 and
   2001:db8:1:0001:8000::/65.

   Both DHCPv6 servers are simultaneously active and operational, and



Brzozowski, et al.       Expires March 11, 2013                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      DHCPv6 Redundancy Considerations      September 2012


   each allocates IPv6 addresses from the corresponding pools per device
   class.  The address allocation is governed largely through the use of
   the DHCPv6 preference option, so the server with the higher
   preference value is always preferred.  Additional proprietary
   mechanisms can be used to further enforce the favouring of one DHCP
   server over another.  An example of such a scenario is presented in
   Figure 1.

   It is important to note that, over time, it is possible that bindings
   will be unevenly distributed amongst the DHCPv6 servers and no one
   server will be authoritative for all of them.

   As defined in [RFC3315], a DHCPv6 ADVERTISE message with a preference
   option of 255 is an indicator to a DHCPv6 client to immediately begin
   a client-initiated message exchange by transmitting a REQUEST message
   to the server that sent the ADVERTISE.  Alternatively, a DHCPv6
   ADVERTISE message with no preference option (or one with a value less
   than 255) is an indicator to the client that it must wait for
   subsequent ADVERTISE messages before choosing the server to which is
   responds, as described in Section 17.1.2 of [RFC3315].

   In the event of a DHCPv6 server failure it is desirable (but not
   essential) for a server other than the server that originally
   responded to be able to rebind the client's lease.  Given the
   proposed architecture, the remaining active DHCPv6 server will have a
   different address pool configured, making it technically incorrect
   for the same to rebind the client in its current state.  Ultimately,
   the rebinding will fail and the client will acquire a new binding
   from the pool configured in the active server.

   To reduce the possibility that a client or some other element on the
   network will experience a disruption in service or access to relevant
   binding data, shorter values for T1, T2, valid, and preferred
   lifetimes can be used.  The values for the last three can be adjusted
   or configured to minimize service disruption.  Ideally, setting them
   equal (or nealy equal) can be used to trigger a DHCPv6 client to
   reacquire the IPv6 address, prefix, and or configuration information
   almost immediately after the rebinding fails.  It is important to
   note however, that shorter values will create an additional load on
   the DHCPv6 servers.

   While using a split prefix configuration model the dynamic updates to
   DNS [RFC2136] can be coordinated to ensure that the DNS is properly
   updated with the current binding information.  Challenges arise with
   regards to the update of the PTR resource record for IPv6 addresses
   since the DNS information may need to be overwritten in a failure
   condition.  The use of a split prefixes enables the differentiation
   of bindings and binding timing to determine which represents the

   current state.  This becomes particularly important when DHCPv6
   Leasequery [RFC5007] and/or DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery [RFC5460] are used
   to determine lease or binding state.

   Finally, a benefit of this scheme is that the use of separate pools
   per DHCPv6 server makes failure conditions more obvious and
   detectable.

6.2.  Multiple Unique Prefixes

   In the multiple prefix model, each DHCPv6 server is configured with a
   unique, non-overlapping prefix.  A /64 pool equal to the prefix is
   configured on each server.  For example, the 2001:db8:1:0000::/64
   pool would be assigned to a single DHCPv6 server for allocation to
   clients equal to its parent prefix 2001:db8:1:0000::/64.  The second
   DHCPv6 server could use 2001:db8:1:0001:::/64 as both pool and
   prefix.  This would be repeated for each active DHCP server.  An
   example of this scenario is presented in Figure 2.

   The major difference between the split prefixes approach and the
   multiple unique prefixes one is that the latter does not require
   prefixes to be adjacent.  In fact, the split prefixes approach can be
   considered a special case of the multiple unique prefixes approach.

   This approach uses a unique prefix and ultimately pool per DHCPv6
   server with the corresponding prefixes configured for use in the
   network.  The corresponding network infrastructure must in turn be
   configured to use multiple prefixes on the interface(s) facing the
   DHCPv6 clients.  The configuration is similar on all the servers, but
   a different prefix and a different preference is used for each DHCPv6
   server.

   This approach drastically increases the rate of consumption of IPv6
   prefixes and also yields operational and management challenges
   related to the underlying network since a significantly higher number
   of prefixes need to be configured and routed.  It also does not
   provide a clean migration path to the desired solution using a
   standards-based DHCPv6 redundancy or failover protocol (which of
   course, has yet to be specified).

   The use of multiple unique prefixes provides benefits related to
   dynamic updates to DNS similar to those referred to in Section 6.1.
   The use of multiple unique prefixes enables the differentiation of
   bindings and binding timing to determine which represents the current
   state.  This becomes particularly important when DHCPv6 Leasequery
   [RFC5007] and/or DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery [RFC5460] are used to
   determine lease or binding state.  The use of separate prefixes and
   pools per DHCPv6 server makes failure conditions more obvious and
   detectable.

6.3.  Identical Prefixes

   In the identical prefix model, each DHCPv6 server is configured with
   the same overlapping prefix and pool deployed for use within an IPv6
   network.  Distribution between two or more servers, for example,
   would require that the same /64 prefix and pool be configured on all
   DHCP servers.  For example, the 2001:db8:1:0001:0000::/64 pool would
   be assigned to all the DHCPv6 servers for allocation to clients
   derived from the 2001:db8:1:0001::/64 pool.  This would be repeated
   for each active DHCP server.  An example of such a scenario is

   presented in Figure 3.

   This approach uses the same prefix, length, and pool definition
   across multiple DHCPv6 servers: all other configuration parameters
   remain the same, with the exception of the DHCPv6 preference.  Such
   an approach conceivably eases the migration of DHCPv6 services to
   fully support a standards based redundancy or failover protocol, once
   such solution becomes available.  Similar to the split prefix
   architecture described above this approach does not place any
   additional addressing requirements on the network infrastructure.

   The use of identical prefixes provides no benefit or advantage
   related to dynamic DNS updates, support of DHCPv6 Leasequery
   [RFC5007] or DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery [RFC5460].  In this case all DHCP
   servers will use the same prefix and pool configurations making it
   less obvious that a failure condition or event has occurred.

7.  Challenges and Issues

   The lack of interaction between DHCPv6 servers introduces a number of
   challenges related to the operations of the same service instances in
   a production environment.  The following areas are of particular
   concern:






Brzozowski, et al.       Expires March 11, 2013                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft      DHCPv6 Redundancy Considerations      September 2012


   o  In the identical prefixes scenario, both servers must follow the
      same address allocation procedure, i.e. they both must use the
      same algorithm and the same policy to determine which address is
      going to be assigned to a specific client.  Otherwise there is a
      distinct chance that each server will assign the same address to
      two different clients.  It is expected that both servers will
      receive each incoming REQUEST message.  Usually no special action
      is required to achieve this as REQUEST messages are sent to
      multicast address by directly connected clients.  Relays are
      expected to forward incoming client messages to all servers.  The
      client indicates chosen server by including its DUID in Server-ID
      option.  The chosen server assigns the address and other
      configuration options, while the other server discards the
      incoming request.  In case of a failure of one server, the other
      server will assign the same address by following the same
      algorithm and the same policy.

   o  Interactions with DNS server(s) using dynamic update for the same
      address when one or more DHCPv6 servers have become unavailable.
      This specifically becomes a challenge when (or if) nodes that were
      initially granted a lease:

      1.  Attempt to renew or rebind the lease originally granted, or

      2.  Attempt to obtain a new lease

      The DHCID resource record [RFC4701] allows identification of the
      current owner of the specific DNS data that is the target of an
      update [RFC2136].  [RFC4704] specifies how DHCPv6 servers and/or
      client may perform updates.  [RFC4703] provides a way to solve
      conflicts between clients.  Although the [RFC4703] deals with most
      cases, it is still possible to leave abandoned resource records.
      Consider the following scenario: there are two independent
      servers, A and B. Server A assigns a lease to a client and updates
      the DNS with an AAAA record for the assigned address.  When the
      client renews, server A is not available and server B assigns a
      different lease.  The DNS is again updated, so now two AAAA
      resource records are present for the client: there is no
      indication as which of the two leases is active.  If server A
      never recovers, its information may never be removed (although it
      should be noted that this case is somewhat similar to that of a
      single server crashing and leaving abandoned resource records).

   o  Interactions with DHCPv6 servers to facilitate the acquisition of
      IPv6 lease data by way of the DHCPv6 Leasequery [RFC5007] or
      DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery [RFC5460] protocols when one or more DHCPv6
      servers have granted leases to DHCPv6 clients and later became
      unavailable.  If the lease data is required and the granting

      server is unavailable, it will not be possible to obtain any
      information about leases granted until one of the following has
      taken place:

      1.  The granting DHCPv6 server becomes available with all lease
          information restored.

      2.  The client has renewed or rebound its lease against a
          different DHCPv6 server.

      It is important to note that any exchange of available leases and
      synchronization between DHCPv6 servers is not possible until a
      redundancy or failover protocol is standardized or proprietary
      solutions become available.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any actions from IANA.


9.  Security Considerations

   Additional security considerations are created through the use of
   this interim architecture beyond what has been cited in Section 23 of
   [RFC3315].  In particular, Dynamic DNS update using the models
   defined in this document allows for the possibility of not removing
   abandoned DNS records, even when using conflict resolution mechanism
   defined in [RFC4703].  However, this is no worse than a case where a
   single deployed server crashes and its lease database cannot be
   recovered.

   When using identical prefixes model, care must be taken to ensure
   that all servers use the same lease allocation procedure and are
   configured with the same policy.  If this guidance is not followed,
   there is a risk of assignment of the same lease to two separate
   clients.  In some cases that situation can be recovered by using
   Duplicate Address Detection (Neighbor Discovery) and DECLINE
   mechanism (DHCPv6).
