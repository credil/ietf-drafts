Abstract

   This document defines two new configuration attributes for Internet
   Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2).  These attributes can be
   used for carrying the IPv4 and IPv6 address of the Proxy-Call Control
   and Service function (P-CSCF).  This is one of the few methods that
   an IPsec client can obtain the IP address of the P-CSCF function
   located in the home network.

Internet-Draft          3GPP IMS Option for IKEv2          February 2013


1.  Introduction

   The 3GPP S2b reference point [TS23402], specified by the 3GPP system
   architecture defines a mechanism for allowing a mobile node attached
   in an untrusted non-3GPP IP Access Network to securely connect to the
   3GPP home network and access IP services.  In this scenario, the
   mobile node establishes an IPsec tunnel to the security gateway
   called ePDG and which in turn establishes a PMIPv6/GTP tunnel to the
   PDN gateway where the mobile node's session is anchored.  The below
   figure shows the interworking option for Untrusted Non-3GPP access.



                                 +------------+
                                 |    ePDG    |

           Figure 1: Exchange of IPv4 Traffic Offload Selectors

   A mobile node in this scenario may potentially need to access the IMS
   services in the home network.  Currently, there are no attributes in
   IKEv2 that can be used for carrying these information elements.  In
   the absence of these Attributes the mobile node needs to be
   statically configured with this information and this is proving to be
   an operational challenge.

   This specification therefore defines two new IKEv2 attributes
   [RFC5996] that allows an IPsec gateway to provide the IPv4 and/or
   IPv6 address of the P-CSCF function.  These attributes can be
   exchanged by IKEv2 peers as part of the configuration payload
   exchange.

2.1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  Terminology

   All the IKEv2 related terms used in this document are to be
   interpreted as defined in [RFC5996] and [RFC5739].  All the mobility
   related terms are to interpreted as defined in [RFC5213] and
   [RFC5844].  Additionally, this document uses the following terms:

   Proxy-Call Session Control Function (P-CSCF)

      The P-CSCF is the entry point to the 3GPP IMS (IP Multimedia
      Subsystem) domain and serves as the outbound proxy server for the
      mobile node.  The mobile node attaches to the P-CSCF prior to
      performing IMS registrations and initiating SIP sessions.


3.  P-CSCF_IP4_ADDRESS Configuration Attribute

   The P-CSCF_IP4_ADDRESS configuration attribute is formatted as
   follows:


    0                   1                   2                   3

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the following two IANA actions.

   o  Action-1: This specification defines a new IKEv2 attribute for
      carrying the IPv4 address of P-CSCF function.  This attribute is
      defined in Section 3.  The Type value for this Attribute needs to
      be assigned from the IKEv2 Configuration Payload Attribute Types
      namespace defined in [RFC5996].

   o  Action-2: This specification defines a new IKEv2 attribute for
      carrying the IPv6 address of P-CSCF function.  This attribute is



Noble, et al.            Expires August 22, 2013                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          3GPP IMS Option for IKEv2          February 2013


      defined in Section 4.  The Type value for this Attribute needs to
      be assigned from the IKEv2 Configuration Payload Attribute Types
      namespace defined in [RFC5996].


7.  Security Considerations

   This document is an extension to IKEv2 [RFC5996] and therefore it
   inherits all the security properties of IKEv2.

   The two new IKEv2 attributes defined in this specification are for
   carrying the IPv4 and IPv6 address of the P-CSCF function.  These
   attributes can be exchanged by IKE peers as part of the configuration
   payload and the currently defined IKEv2 security framework provides
   the needed integrity and privacy protection for these attributes.
   Therefore this specification does not introduce any new security
   vulnarabilities.
