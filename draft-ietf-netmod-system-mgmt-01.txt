Internet-Draft           YANG System Management                June 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG [RFC6020] data model for the
   configuration and identification of the management system of a
   device.

   Devices that are managed by NETCONF and perhaps other mechanisms have
   common properties that need to be configured and monitored in a
   standard way.

   The YANG module defined in this document provides the following
   features:

   o  system administrative data configuration

   o  system identification monitoring

   o  system time-of-day configuration and monitoring

   o  user authentication configuration

   o  local users configuration

1.1.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, [RFC2119].

1.1.1.  Terms

   The following terms are used within this document:

   o  system: This term refers to the embodiment of the entire set of
      management interfaces that a single NETCONF server is supporting
      at a given moment.  The set of physical entities managed by a
      single NETCONF server can be static or it can change dynamically.

2.  Objectives

2.1.  System Identification

   There are many common properties used to identify devices, operating
   systems, software versions, etc. that need to be supported in the
   system data module.  These objects are defined as operational data
   and intended to be specific to the device vendor.

   Some user-configurable administrative strings are also provided such
   as the system location and description.

2.2.  System Time Management

   The management of the date and time used by the system need to be
   supported.  Use of one or more NTP servers to automatically set the
   system date and time need to be possible.  Utilization of the
   Timezone database [RFC6557] also need to be supported.

2.3.  User Authentication

   The authentication mechanism need to support password authentication
   over RADIUS, to support deployment scenarios with centralized
   authentication servers.  Additionally, local users need to be
   supported, for scenarios when no centralized authentication server
   exists, or for situations where the centralized authentication server
   cannot be reached from the device.

   Since the mandatory transport protocol for NETCONF is SSH [RFC6242]
   the authentication model need to support SSH's "publickey" and
   "password" authentication methods [RFC4252].

   The model for authentication configuration should be flexible enough
   to support authentication methods defined by other standard documents
   or by vendors.

3.  System Data Model

3.1.  System Identification

   The data model for system identification has the following structure:

      +--rw system
         +--rw contact?          string
         +--rw name?             string
         +--rw location?         string

   structure:

      +--rw system
         +--rw clock
         |  +--ro current-datetime?      yang:date-and-time
         |  +--ro boot-datetime?         yang:date-and-time
         |  +--rw (timezone)?
         |     +--:(timezone-location)
         |     |  +--rw timezone-location?     string
         |     +--:(timezone-utc-offset)
         |        +--rw timezone-utc-offset?   int16
         +--rw ntp
            +--rw use-ntp?      boolean
            +--rw configuration-source*  identityref
            +--rw ntp-server [address]
               +--rw association-type? enumeration
               +--rw address    inet:host

               +--rw prefer     boolean

3.3.  DNS Resolver Model

   The data model for configuration of the DNS resolver has the
   following structure:

Internet-Draft           YANG System Management                June 2012


      +--rw system
         +--rw dns
            +--rw configuration-source*   identityref
            +--rw search*    inet:host
            +--rw server*    inet:ip-address
            +--rw options
               +--rw ndots?      uint8
               +--rw timeout?    uint8
               +--rw attempts?   uint8

3.4.  RADIUS Client Model

   The data model for configuration of the RADIUS client has the
   following structure:

      +--rw system
         +--rw radius
            +--rw server [address]
            |  +--rw address                inet:host
            |  +--rw authentication-port?   inet:port-number
            |  +--rw shared-secret?         string
            +--rw options
               +--rw timeout?    uint8
               +--rw attempts?   uint8

3.5.  User Authentication Model

   This document defines three authentication methods for use with
   NETCONF:

   o  publickey for local users over SSH

   o  password for local users over any transport

   o  password for RADIUS users over any transport

   Additional methods can be defined by other standard documents or by
   vendors.

   This document defines two optional YANG features, "local-users" and
   "radius-authentication", which the server advertises to indicate
   support for configuring local users on the device, and support for
   using RADIUS for authentication, respectively.

   The authentication parameters defined in this document are primarily
   used to configure authentication of NETCONF users, but MAY also be
   used by other interfaces, e.g., a Command Line Interface or a Web-
   based User Interface.

Internet-Draft           YANG System Management                June 2012


   The data model for user authentication has the following structure:

      +--rw system
         +--rw authentication
            +--rw user-authentication-order*   identityref
            +--rw user [name]
               +--rw name        string
               +--rw password?   crypt-hash
               +--rw ssh-key [name]
                  +--rw name         string
                  +--rw algorithm?   string
                  +--rw key-data?    binary

3.5.1.  SSH Public Key Authentication

   If the NETCONF server advertises the "local-users" feature,
   configuration of local users and their SSH public keys is supported
   in the /system/authentication/user list.

   Public key authentication is requested by the SSH client.  If the
   "local-users" feature is supported, then when a NETCONF client starts
   an SSH session towards the server using the "publickey"
   authentication "method name" [RFC4252], the SSH server looks up the
   user name given in the SSH authentication request in the /system/
   authentication/user list, and verifies the key as described in
   [RFC4253].

3.5.2.  Local User Password Authentication

   If the NETCONF server advertises the "local-users" feature,
   configuration of local users and their passwords is supported in the
   /system/authentication/user list.

   For NETCONF transport protocols that support password authentication,
   the leaf-list "user-authentication-order" is used to control if local
   user password authentication should be used.

   In SSH, password authentication is requested by the client.  Other
   NETCONF transport protocols MAY also support password authentication.

   When local user password authentication is requested, the NETCONF
   transport looks up the user name provided by the client in the
   /system/ authentication/user list, and verifies the password.

3.5.3.  RADIUS Password Authentication

   If the NETCONF server advertises the "radius-authentication" feature,
   the device supports user authentication using RADIUS.

   For NETCONF transport protocols that support password authentication,
   the leaf-list "user-authentication-order" is used to control if
   RADIUS password authentication should be used.

   In SSH, password authentication is requested by the client.  Other
   NETCONF transport protocols MAY also support password authentication.

3.6.  System Control

   Two protocol operations are included to restart or shutdown the
   system.  The 'system-restart' operation can be used to restart the
   entire system (not just the NETCONF server).  The 'system-shutdown'
   operation can be used to power off the entire system.

          When a clear text value is set to a leaf of this type, the
          server calculates a password hash, and stores the result
          in the datastore.  Thus, the password is never stored in
          clear text.

          When a leaf of this type is read, the stored password hash is
          returned.

          A value of this type matches one of the forms:

            $0$<clear text password>
            $<id>$<salt>$<password hash>

         The '$0$' prefix signals that the value is clear text.  When
         such a value is received by the server, a hash value is
         calculated, and the string '$<id>$<salt>$' is prepended to the
         result, where <salt> is a random 2-16 characters long salt
         used to generate the digest.  This value is stored in the
         configuration data store.

         If a value starting with '$<id>$<salt>$' is received, the
         server knows that the value already represents a hashed value,
         and stores it as is in the data store.

         When a server needs to verify a password given by a user, it
         finds the stored password hash string for that user, extracts
         the salt, and calculates the hash with the salt and given
         password as input.  If the calculated hash value is the same
         as the stored value, the password given by the client is
         correct.

         This type defines the following hash functions:

           id | hash function | feature
           ---+---------------+-------------------
            1 | MD5           | crypt-hash-md5
            5 | SHA-256       | crypt-hash-sha-256
            6 | SHA-512       | crypt-hash-sha-512

         The server indicates support for the different hash functions
         by advertising the corresponding feature.";

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the
   secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is SSH [RFC6242].

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module which
   are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  /system/clock/timezone: This choice contains the objects used to
      control the timezone used by the device.

   o  /system/ntp: This container contains the objects used to control
      the Network Time Protocol servers used by the device.

   o  /system/dns: This container contains the objects used to control
      the Domain Name System servers used by the device.

   o  /system/radius: This container contains the objects used to
      control the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service servers
      used by the device.

   o  /system/authentication/user-authentication-order: This leaf
      controls how user login attempts are authenticated by the device.

   o  /system/authentication/user: This list contains the local users
      enabled on the system.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  /system/platform: This container has objects which may help
      identify the specific NETCONF server and/or operating system
      implementation used on the device.

   Some of the RPC operations in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control access to these operations.  These are the
   operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  set-current-datetime: Changes the current date and time on the
      device.

   o  system-restart: Reboots the device.

   o  system-shutdown: Shuts down the device.

7.  Change Log

       -- RFC Ed.: remove this section before publication.

7.1.  00-01

   o  added configuration-source identities

   o  added configuration-source leaf to ntp and dns (via grouping) to
      choose configuration source

   o  added association-type, iburst, prefer, and true leafs to the ntp-
      server list

   o  extended the ssh keys for a user to a list of keys. support all
      defined key algorithms, not just dsa and rsa

   o  clarified timezone-utc-offset description-stmt

   o  removed '/system/ntp/server/true' leaf from data model
