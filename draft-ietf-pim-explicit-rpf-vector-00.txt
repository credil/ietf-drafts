1.  Introduction

   In some applications it might be useful to have a way to specify
   the explicit path along which the PIM join is propagated.   

   This document defines a new TLV in the PIM Join Attribute message 
   [RFC5384] for specifying the explicit path.

   The procedures in [RFC5496] define how a RPF vector can be used 
   to influence the path selection in the absence of a route to the 
   Source. However, the same procedures can be used to override a 
   route to the Source when it exists. It is possible to include 
   multiple RPF vectors in the stack where each router along the 
   path will perform a unicast route lookup on the first vector in 
   the attribute list. Once the router owning the address of the RPF 
   vector is reached, following the procedures in [RFC5496], the RPF
   vector will be removed from the attribute list. This will result 
   in a 'loosely' routed path based on the unicast reachability of 
   the RPF vector(s). We call this loosely because we still depend 
   on unicast routing reachability to the RPF Vector.

   In some scenarios we don't want to rely on the unicast
   reachability to the RPF vector address and we want to build a 
   path strictly based on the RPF vectors. In that case the RPF 
   vector(s) represent a list of directly connected PIM neighbors 
   along the path. For these vectors we MUST NOT do a unicast route
   lookup. We call these 'explicit' RPF vector addresses. If a 
   router receiving an explicit RPF vector does not have a PIM 
   neighbor matching the explicit RPF vector address it MUST NOT 
   fall back to loosely routing the JOIN. Since the behavior of 
   the explicit RPF vector differs from the loose RPF vector as 
   defined [RFC5496], we're defining a new attribute called the 
   explicit RPF Vector.


2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL"
   "NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described 
   in [RFC2119].

3.  Solution Requirements

   Some broadcast video transport networks use a multicast PIM 
   live-live resiliency model for video delivery based on PIM SSM 
   or PIM ASM. Live-Live implies using 2 active-active spatially 
   diverse multicast trees to transport video flows from root to 
   leaf multicast routers. The leaf multicast router receives 2 
   copies from the PIM multicast core and will replicate 1 copy 
   towards the receivers [draft-mofrr-karan].

   One of the main requirements of PIM live-live resiliency model 
   is to ensure path-diversity of the active-active PIM trees in 
   the core such that they do not intersect to avoid a single 
   point of failure. IGP routed RPF paths of active-active PIM 
   trees could be routed over the same transit router and create 
   a single point of failure. It might be useful to have a way to 
   specify the explicit path along which the PIM join is propagated.
   
   How the explicit RPF vector stack is determined is outside the 
   scope of this document. It may either be manually configured by
   the network operator or procedures may be implemented on the 
   egress router to dynamically calculate the vector stack based on 
   a link state database protocol, like OSPF or ISIS.

   Due to the fact that the leaf router receives two copies of the
   multicast stream via two diverse paths, there is no need for PIM
   to repair the broken path immediately. It is up to the egress 
   router to either wait for the broken path to be repaired or build 
   a new explicit path using a new RPF vector stack. Which method is
   applied depends very much on how the vector stack was determined 
   initially. Double failures are not considered and outside the scope
   of this document

4.  Use of the PIM Explicit RPF Vector
 
   Figure 1 provides an example multicast join path R4->R3->R6->R5->R2->R1, 
   where the multicast JOIN is explicitly routed to the source hop-by-hop 
   using the explicit RPF vector list. 


   [S]---(R1)--(R2)---(R3)--(R4)---[R]
          <---   |      |  ---
             |   |      |  |
             | (R5)---(R6) |
             - (S,G) Join -

5.  Explicit RPF Vector Attribute 
 
   This draft uses vector attribute 4 for specifying an explicit RPF 
   vector. 


6.  Conflicting RPF Vectors 
 
   It is possible that a PIM router has multiple downstream neighbors.
   If for the same multicast route there is inconsistency between the 
   Explicit RPF Vector stacks provided by the downstream PIM neighbor, 
   the procedures as documented in RFC5384 section 3.3.3 apply.

   
7.  Explicit RPF Vector Attribute TLV Format

   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |F|S| Type      | Length        |        Value
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-.......

   F bit
   -----
   The F bit MUST be set to 0. Otherwise there could be loops.
   
   S bit
   -----
   Bottom of Stack. If this bit is set then this is the last
   TLV in the stack.

   Type
   ----
   The Vector Attribute type is 4.

   Length
   ------
   Length depending on Address Family of Encoded-Unicast address.

   Value
   -----
   Encoded-Unicast address. For IPv6, this should be a unique global 
   address and NOT link-local.


8.  IANA Considerations

   An new attribute type from the "PIM Join Attribute Types" registry
   needs to be assigned by IANA for the RPF Vector.  The proposed
   value is 4.


9.  Security Considerations

   Security of the RPF Vector Attribute is only guaranteed by the
   security of the PIM packet, so the security considerations for PIM
   join packets as described in PIM-SM [RFC4601] apply here.
