                DHC Load Balancing Algorithm for DHCPv6
                      draft-kostur-dhc-loadbv6-00

Abstract

   This document proposes a method of algorithmic load balancing for
   DHCPv6 traffic.  It enables multiple, cooperating servers to decide
   which one should service a client, without exchanging any information
   beyond initial configuration.  The server selection is based on the
   servers hashing client DHCP Unique Identifiers (DUIDs) when multiple
   IPv6 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv6) servers are
   available to service DHCPv6 clients.  The proposed technique provides
   for efficient server selection when multiple DHCPv6 servers offer
   services on a network without requiring any changes to existing
   DHCPv6 clients.  The same method is proposed to select the target
   server of a DHCPv6 relay.

1.  Introduction

   This protocol is intended to extend the algorithm described in RFC
   3074 [RFC3074] to apply to DHCPv6 traffic.  Most of the terminology
   and procedures are identical to the ones specified in RFC 3074.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Background and External Requirements

   The requirements for DHCPv6 are substantially the same as for DHCPv4,
   replacing DHCPDISCOVER with SOLICIT, DHCPREQUEST with REQUEST,
   CONFIRM, RENEW, or REBIND (as appropriate), etc.

3.  Operation

   A DHCPv6 server performing this load balancing will operate in
   substantially the same manner as if it were a DHCPv4 server load
   balancing an incoming DHCPv4/BOOTP packet with the following two
   differences.

3.1.  Selecting the STID

Internet-Draft  DHC Load Balancing Algorithm for DHCPv6      August 2012


   DHCPv6 servers MUST use the client's DUID as the STID.  At most the
   first 16 bytes of the DUID are used.  Of the 4 DUID types that
   currently exist, only a DUID-UUID [RFC6355] is guaranteed to exceed
   16 bytes.  The variability of the first 14 bytes of the UUID should
   be sufficient to allow for the hashing function to perform
   adequately.

3.2.  Replacing the secs field

   A DHCPv6 server providing the capability of Delayed Service SHOULD
   use the value in the OPTION_ELAPSED_TIME wherever RFC 3074 makes
   reference to the secs field.

4.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Bernie Volz, Steve Gonczi, Ted Lemon, and Rob Stevens as
   this document heavily borrows from their previous work on RFC 3074.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   This proposal in and by itself provides no security, nor does it
   impact existing security.  Servers using this algorithm are
   responsible for ensuring that if the contents of the HBA are
   transmitted over the network as part of the process of configuring
   any server, that message be secured against tampering, since
   tampering with the HBA could result in denial of service for some or
   all clients.
