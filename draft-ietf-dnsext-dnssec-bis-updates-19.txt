           Clarifications and Implementation Notes for DNSSEC
                draft-ietf-dnsext-dnssec-bis-updates-19

Abstract

   This document is a collection of technical clarifications to the
   DNSSEC document set.  It is meant to serve as a resource to
   implementors as well as a repository of DNSSEC errata.

   This document updates the core DNSSEC documents (RFC4033, RFC4034,
   and RFC4035) as well as the NSEC3 specification (RFC5155).  It also
   defines NSEC3 and SHA-2 as core parts of the DNSSEC specification.

Internet-Draft         DNSSEC Implementation Notes             July 2012


1.  Introduction and Terminology

   This document lists some additions, clarifications and corrections to
   the core DNSSEC specification, as originally described in [RFC4033],
   [RFC4034], and [RFC4035], and later amended by [RFC5155].  (See
   section Section 2 for more recent additions to that core document
   set.)

   It is intended to serve as a resource for implementors and as a
   repository of items that need to be addressed when advancing the
   DNSSEC documents along the Standards Track.

1.1.  Structure of this Document

   The clarifications and changes to DNSSEC are sorted according to
   their importance, starting with ones which could, if ignored, lead to
   security problems and progressing down to clarifications that are
   expected to have little operational impact.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


2.  Important Additions to DNSSEC

   This section lists some documents that are now considered core DNSSEC
   protocol documents in addition to those originally specified in
   Section 10 of [RFC4033].

2.1.  NSEC3 Support

   [RFC5155] describes the use and behavior of the NSEC3 and NSEC3PARAM
   records for hashed denial of existence.  Validator implementations
   are strongly encouraged to include support for NSEC3 because a number
   of highly visible zones use it.  Validators that do not support
   validation of responses using NSEC3 will be hampered in validating
   large portions of the DNS space.

   [RFC5155] is now considered part of the DNS Security Document Family
   as described by [RFC4033], Section 10.

   Note that the algorithm identifiers defined in RFC5155 (DSA-NSEC3-
   SHA1 and RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1) and RFC5702 (RSASHA256 and RSASHA512)
   signal that a zone might be using NSEC3, rather than NSEC.  The zone

Internet-Draft         DNSSEC Implementation Notes             July 2012


   may be using either and validators supporting these algorithms MUST
   support both NSEC3 and NSEC responses.

2.2.  SHA-2 Support

   [RFC4509] describes the use of SHA-256 as a digest algorithm in
   Delegation Signer (DS) RRs.  [RFC5702] describes the use of the
   RSASHA256 and RSASHA512 algorithms in DNSKEY and RRSIG RRs.
   Validator implementations are strongly encouraged to include support
   for these algorithms for DS, DNSKEY, and RRSIG records.

   Both [RFC4509] and [RFC5702] are now considered part of the DNS
   Security Document Family as described by [RFC4033], Section 10.


3.  Scaling Concerns

3.1.  Implement a BAD cache

   Section 4.7 of RFC4035 permits security-aware resolvers to implement
   a BAD cache.  That guidance has changed: security-aware resolvers
   SHOULD implement a BAD cache as described in RFC4035.

   This change in guidance is based on operational experience with
   DNSSEC administrative errors leading to significant increases in DNS
   traffic, with an accompanying realization that such events are more
   likely and more damaging than originally supposed.  An example of one
   such event is documented in "Roll Over and Die" [Huston].


4.  Security Concerns

   This section provides clarifications that, if overlooked, could lead
   to security issues.

4.1.  Clarifications on Non-Existence Proofs

   [RFC4035] Section 5.4 under-specifies the algorithm for checking non-
   existence proofs.  In particular, the algorithm as presented would
   incorrectly allow an NSEC or NSEC3 RR from an ancestor zone to prove
   the non-existence of RRs in the child zone.

   An "ancestor delegation" NSEC RR (or NSEC3 RR) is one with:

   o  the NS bit set,
   o  the SOA bit clear, and





Weiler & Blacka         Expires January 14, 2013                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         DNSSEC Implementation Notes             July 2012


   o  a signer field that is shorter than the owner name of the NSEC RR,
      or the original owner name for the NSEC3 RR.

   Ancestor delegation NSEC or NSEC3 RRs MUST NOT be used to assume non-
   existence of any RRs below that zone cut, which include all RRs at
   that (original) owner name other than DS RRs, and all RRs below that
   owner name regardless of type.

   Similarly, the algorithm would also allow an NSEC RR at the same
   owner name as a DNAME RR, or an NSEC3 RR at the same original owner
   name as a DNAME, to prove the non-existence of names beneath that
   DNAME.  An NSEC or NSEC3 RR with the DNAME bit set MUST NOT be used
   to assume the non-existence of any subdomain of that NSEC/NSEC3 RR's
   (original) owner name.

4.2.  Validating Responses to an ANY Query

   [RFC4035] does not address how to validate responses when QTYPE=*.
   As described in Section 6.2.2 of [RFC1034], a proper response to
   QTYPE=* may include a subset of the RRsets at a given name.  That is,
   it is not necessary to include all RRsets at the QNAME in the
   response.

   When validating a response to QTYPE=*, all received RRsets that match
   QNAME and QCLASS MUST be validated.  If any of those RRsets fail
   validation, the answer is considered Bogus.  If there are no RRsets
   matching QNAME and QCLASS, that fact MUST be validated according to
   the rules in [RFC4035] Section 5.4 (as clarified in this document).
   To be clear, a validator must not expect to receive all records at
   the QNAME in response to QTYPE=*.

4.3.  Check for CNAME

   Section 5 of [RFC4035] says nothing explicit about validating
   responses based on (or that should be based on) CNAMEs.  When
   validating a NOERROR/NODATA response, validators MUST check the CNAME
   bit in the matching NSEC or NSEC3 RR's type bitmap in addition to the
   bit for the query type.

   Without this check, an attacker could successfully transform a
   positive CNAME response into a NOERROR/NODATA response by (e.g.)
   simply stripping the CNAME RRset from the response.  A naive
   validator would then note that the QTYPE was not present in the
   matching NSEC/NSEC3 RR, but fail to notice that the CNAME bit was
   set, and thus the response should have been a positive CNAME
   response.

Internet-Draft         DNSSEC Implementation Notes             July 2012


4.4.  Insecure Delegation Proofs

   [RFC4035] Section 5.2 specifies that a validator, when proving a
   delegation is not secure, needs to check for the absence of the DS
   and SOA bits in the NSEC (or NSEC3) type bitmap.  The validator also
   MUST check for the presence of the NS bit in the matching NSEC (or
   NSEC3) RR (proving that there is, indeed, a delegation), or
   alternately make sure that the delegation is covered by an NSEC3 RR
   with the Opt-Out flag set.

   Without this check, an attacker could reuse an NSEC or NSEC3 RR
   matching a non-delegation name to spoof an unsigned delegation at
   that name.  This would claim that an existing signed RRset (or set of
   signed RRsets) is below an unsigned delegation, thus not signed and
   vulnerable to further attack.


5.  Interoperability Concerns

5.1.  Errors in Canonical Form Type Code List

   When canonicalizing DNS names (for both ordering and signing), DNS
   names in the RDATA section of NSEC resource records are not
   downcased.  DNS names in the RDATA section of RRSIG resource records
   are downcased.

   The guidance in the above paragraph differs from what has been
   published before but is consistent with current common practice.
   [RFC4034] Section 6.2 item 3 says that names in both of these RR
   types should be downcased.  The earlier [RFC3755] says that they
   should not.  Current practice follows neither document fully.

   Section 6.2 of RFC4034 also erroneously lists HINFO as a record that
   needs downcasing, and twice at that.  Since HINFO records contain no
   domain names, they are not subject to downcasing.

5.2.  Unknown DS Message Digest Algorithms

   Section 5.2 of [RFC4035] includes rules for how to handle delegations
   to zones that are signed with entirely unsupported public key
   algorithms, as indicated by the key algorithms shown in those zone's
   DS RRsets.  It does not explicitly address how to handle DS records
   that use unsupported message digest algorithms.  In brief, DS records
   using unknown or unsupported message digest algorithms MUST be
   treated the same way as DS records referring to DNSKEY RRs of unknown
   or unsupported public key algorithms.

   The existing text says:



Weiler & Blacka         Expires January 14, 2013                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         DNSSEC Implementation Notes             July 2012


      If the validator does not support any of the algorithms listed in
      an authenticated DS RRset, then the resolver has no supported
      authentication path leading from the parent to the child.  The
      resolver should treat this case as it would the case of an
      authenticated NSEC RRset proving that no DS RRset exists, as
      described above.

   In other words, when determining the security status of a zone, a
   validator disregards any authenticated DS records that specify
   unknown or unsupported DNSKEY algorithms.  If none are left, the zone
   is treated as if it were unsigned.

   This document modifies the above text to additionally disregard
   authenticated DS records using unknown or unsupported message digest
   algorithms.

5.3.  Private Algorithms

   As discussed above, Section 5.2 of [RFC4035] requires that validators
   make decisions about the security status of zones based on the public
   key algorithms shown in the DS records for those zones.  In the case
   of private algorithms, as described in [RFC4034] Appendix A.1.1, the
   eight-bit algorithm field in the DS RR is not conclusive about what
   algorithm(s) is actually in use.

   If no private algorithms appear in the DS RRset, or if any supported
   algorithm appears in the DS RRset, no special processing is needed.
   Furthermore, if the validator implementation does not support any
   private algorithms, or only supports private algorithms using an
   algorithm number not present in the DS RRset, no special processing
   is needed.

   In the remaining cases, the security status of the zone depends on
   whether or not the resolver supports any of the private algorithms in
   use (provided that these DS records use supported message digest
   algorithms, as discussed in Section 5.2 of this document).  In these
   cases, the resolver MUST retrieve the corresponding DNSKEY for each
   private algorithm DS record and examine the public key field to
   determine the algorithm in use.  The security-aware resolver MUST
   ensure that the hash of the DNSKEY RR's owner name and RDATA matches
   the digest in the DS RR as described in Section 5.2 of [RFC4035],
   authenticating the DNSKEY.  If all of the retrieved and authenticated
   DNSKEY RRs use unknown or unsupported private algorithms, then the
   zone is treated as if it were unsigned.

   Note that if none of the private algorithm DS RRs can be securely
   matched to DNSKEY RRs and no other DS establishes that the zone is
   secure, the referral should be considered Bogus data as discussed in



Weiler & Blacka         Expires January 14, 2013                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         DNSSEC Implementation Notes             July 2012


   [RFC4035].

   This clarification facilitates the broader use of private algorithms,
   as suggested by [RFC4955].

5.4.  Caution About Local Policy and Multiple RRSIGs

   When multiple RRSIGs cover a given RRset, [RFC4035] Section 5.3.3
   suggests that "the local resolver security policy determines whether
   the resolver also has to test these RRSIG RRs and how to resolve
   conflicts if these RRSIG RRs lead to differing results."

   This document specifies that a resolver SHOULD accept any valid RRSIG
   as sufficient, and only determine that an RRset is Bogus if all
   RRSIGs fail validation.

   If a resolver adopts a more restrictive policy, there's a danger that
   properly-signed data might unnecessarily fail validation due to cache
   timing issues.  Furthermore, certain zone management techniques, like
   the Double Signature Zone-signing Key Rollover method described in
   section 4.2.1.2 of [RFC4641], will not work reliably.  Such a
   resolver is also vulnerable to malicious insertion of gibberish
   signatures.

5.5.  Key Tag Calculation

   [RFC4034] Appendix B.1 incorrectly defines the Key Tag field
   calculation for algorithm 1.  It correctly says that the Key Tag is
   the most significant 16 of the least significant 24 bits of the
   public key modulus.  However, [RFC4034] then goes on to incorrectly
   say that this is 4th to last and 3rd to last octets of the public key
   modulus.  It is, in fact, the 3rd to last and 2nd to last octets.

5.6.  Setting the DO Bit on Replies

   As stated in Section 3 of [RFC3225], the DO bit of the query MUST be
   copied in the response.  However, in order to interoperate with
   implementations that ignore this rule on sending, resolvers MUST
   ignore the DO bit in responses.

5.7.  Setting the AD Bit on Queries

   The semantics of the AD bit in the query were previously undefined.
   Section 4.6 of [RFC4035] instructed resolvers to always clear the AD
   bit when composing queries.

   This document defines setting the AD bit in a query as a signal
   indicating that the requester understands and is interested in the



Weiler & Blacka         Expires January 14, 2013                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft         DNSSEC Implementation Notes             July 2012


   value of the AD bit in the response.  This allows a requestor to
   indicate that it understands the AD bit without also requesting
   DNSSEC data via the DO bit.

5.8.  Setting the AD Bit on Replies

   Section 3.2.3 of [RFC4035] describes under which conditions a
   validating resolver should set or clear the AD bit in a response.  In
   order to interoperate with legacy stub resolvers and middleboxes that
   neither understand nor ignore the AD bit, validating resolvers SHOULD
   only set the AD bit when a response both meets the conditions listed
   in RFC 4035, section 3.2.3, and the request contained either a set DO
   bit or a set AD bit.

5.9.  Always set the CD bit on Queries

   When processing a request with the CD bit set, a resolver SHOULD
   attempt to return all response data, even data that has failed DNSSEC
   validation.  RFC4035 section 3.2.2 requires a resolver processing a
   request with the CD bit set to set the CD bit on its upstream
   queries.

   This document further specifies that validating resolvers SHOULD set
   the CD bit on every upstream query.  This is regardless of whether
   the CD bit was set on the incoming query or whether it has a trust
   anchor at or above the QNAME.

   [RFC4035] is ambiguous about what to do when a cached response was
   obtained with the CD bit unset, a case that only arises when the
   resolver chooses not to set the CD bit on all upstream queries, as
   specified above.  In the typical case, no new query is required, nor
   does the cache need to track the state of the CD bit used to make a
   given query.  The problem arises when the cached response is a server
   failure (RCODE 2), which may indicate that the requested data failed
   DNSSEC validation at an upstream validating resolver.  ([RFC2308]
   permits caching of server failures for up to five minutes.)  In these
   cases, a new query with the CD bit set is required.

   Appendix B discusses more of the logic behind the recommendation
   presented in this section.

5.10.  Nested Trust Anchors

   A DNSSEC validator may be configured such that, for a given response,
   more than one trust anchor could be used to validate the chain of
   trust to the response zone.  For example, imagine a validator
   configured with trust anchors for "example." and "zone.example."
   When the validator is asked to validate a response to



Weiler & Blacka         Expires January 14, 2013               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft         DNSSEC Implementation Notes             July 2012


   "www.sub.zone.example.", either trust anchor could apply.

   When presented with this situation, DNSSEC validators have a choice
   of which trust anchor(s) to use.  Which to use is a matter of
   implementation choice.  Appendix C discusses several possible
   algorithms.

   It is possible and advisable to expose the choice of policy as a
   configuration option.  As a default, it is suggested that validators
   implement the "Accept Any Success" policy described in Appendix C.2
   while exposing other policies as configuration options.

   The "Accept Any Success" policy is to try all applicable trust
   anchors until one gives a validation result of Secure, in which case
   the final validation result is Secure.  If and only if all applicable
   trust anchors give a result of Insecure, the final validation result
   is Insecure.  If one or more trust anchors lead to a Bogus result and
   there is no Secure result, then the final validation result is Bogus.

5.11.  Mandatory Algorithm Rules

   The last paragraph of RFC4035 Section 2.2 includes rules describing
   which algorithms must be used to sign a zone.  Since these rules have
   been confusing, they are restated using different language here:

      The DS RRset and DNSKEY RRset are used to signal which algorithms
      are used to sign a zone.  The presence of an algorithm in either a
      zone's DS or DNSKEY RRset signals that that algorithm is used to
      sign the entire zone.

      A signed zone MUST include a DNSKEY for each algorithm present in
      the zone's DS RRset and expected trust anchors for the zone.  The
      zone MUST also be signed with each algorithm (though not each key)
      present in the DNSKEY RRset.  It is possible to add algorithms at
      the DNSKEY that aren't in the DS record, but not vice-versa.  If
      more than one key of the same algorithm is in the DNSKEY RRset, it
      is sufficient to sign each RRset with any subset of these DNSKEYs.
      It is acceptable to sign some RRsets with one subset of keys (or
      key) and other RRsets with a different subset, so long as at least
      one DNSKEY of each algorithm is used to sign each RRset.
      Likewise, if there are DS records for multiple keys of the same
      algorithm, any subset of those may appear in the DNSKEY RRset.

   This requirement applies to servers, not validators.  Validators
   SHOULD accept any single valid path.  They SHOULD NOT insist that all
   algorithms signaled in the DS RRset work, and they MUST NOT insist
   that all algorithms signaled in the DNSKEY RRset work.  A validator
   MAY have a configuration option to perform a signature completeness

   test to support troubleshooting.

5.12.  Ignore Extra Signatures From Unknown Keys

   Validating resolvers MUST disregard RRSIGs in a zone that do not
   (currently) have a corresponding DNSKEY in the zone.  Similarly, a
   validating resolver MUST disregard RRSIGs with algorithm types that
   don't exist in the DNSKEY RRset.

   Good key rollover and algorithm rollover practices, as discussed in
   RFC4641 and its successor documents and as suggested by the rules in
   the previous section, may require that such RRSIGs be present in a
   zone.


6.  Minor Corrections and Clarifications

6.1.  Finding Zone Cuts

   Appendix C.8 of [RFC4035] discusses sending DS queries to the servers
   for a parent zone but does not state how to find those servers.
   Specific instructions can be found in Section 4.2 of [RFC4035].

6.2.  Clarifications on DNSKEY Usage

   It is possible to use different DNSKEYs to sign different subsets of
   a zone, constrained only by the rules in Section 5.11.  It is even
   possible to use a different DNSKEY for each RRset in a zone, subject
   only to practical limits on the size of the DNSKEY RRset and the
   above rules.  However, be aware that there is no way to tell
   resolvers what a particular DNSKEY is supposed to be used for -- any
   DNSKEY in the zone's signed DNSKEY RRset may be used to authenticate
   any RRset in the zone.  For example, if a weaker or less trusted
   DNSKEY is being used to authenticate NSEC RRsets or all dynamically
   updated records, that same DNSKEY can also be used to sign any other
   RRsets from the zone.

   Furthermore, note that the SEP bit setting has no effect on how a
   DNSKEY may be used -- the validation process is specifically
   prohibited from using that bit by [RFC4034] section 2.1.2.  It is
   possible to use a DNSKEY without the SEP bit set as the sole secure
   entry point to the zone, yet use a DNSKEY with the SEP bit set to
   sign all RRsets in the zone (other than the DNSKEY RRset).  It is
   also possible to use a single DNSKEY, with or without the SEP bit
   set, to sign the entire zone, including the DNSKEY RRset itself.

6.3.  Errors in Examples

   The text in [RFC4035] Section C.1 refers to the examples in B.1 as
   "x.w.example.com" while B.1 uses "x.w.example".  This is painfully
   obvious in the second paragraph where it states that the RRSIG labels
   field value of 3 indicates that the answer was not the result of
   wildcard expansion.  This is true for "x.w.example" but not for
   "x.w.example.com", which of course has a label count of 4
   (antithetically, a label count of 3 would imply the answer was the
   result of a wildcard expansion).

   The first paragraph of [RFC4035] Section C.6 also has a minor error:
   the reference to "a.z.w.w.example" should instead be "a.z.w.example",
   as in the previous line.

6.4.  Errors in RFC 5155

   A NSEC3 record that matches an Empty Non-Terminal effectively has no
   type associated with it.  This NSEC3 record has an empty type bit
   map.  Section 3.2.1 of [RFC5155] contains the statement:

      Blocks with no types present MUST NOT be included.

   However, the same section contains a regular expression:

      Type Bit Maps Field = ( Window Block # | Bitmap Length | Bitmap )+

   The plus sign in the regular expression indicates that there is one
   or more of the preceding element.  This means that there must be at
   least one window block.  If this window block has no types, it
   contradicts with the first statement.  Therefore, the correct text in
   RFC 5155 3.2.1 should be:

      Type Bit Maps Field = ( Window Block # | Bitmap Length | Bitmap )*


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document specifies no IANA Actions.


8.  Security Considerations

   This document adds SHA-2 and NSEC3 support to the core DNSSEC
   protocol.  Security considerations for those features are discussed
   in the documents defining them.  Additionally, this document
   addresses some ambiguities and omissions in the core DNSSEC documents
   that, if not recognized and addressed in implementations, could lead

   to security failures.  In particular, the validation algorithm
   clarifications in Section 4 are critical for preserving the security
   properties DNSSEC offers.  Furthermore, failure to address some of
   the interoperability concerns in Section 5 could limit the ability to
   later change or expand DNSSEC, including adding new algorithms.

   The recommendation in Section 5.9 to always set the CD bit has
   security implications.  By setting the CD bit, a resolver will not
   benefit from more stringent validation rules or a more complete set
   of trust anchors at an upstream validator.

Appendix B.  Discussion of Setting the CD Bit

   [RFC4035] may be read as relying on the implicit assumption that
   there is at most one validating system between the stub resolver and
   the authoritative server for a given zone.  It is entirely possible,
   however, for more than one validator to exist between a stub resolver
   and an authoritative server.  If these different validators have
   disjoint trust anchors configured, then it is possible that each
   would be able to validate some portion of the DNS tree but neither is
   able to validate all of it.  Accordingly, it might be argued that it
   is desirable not to set the CD bit on upstream queries, because that
   allows for maximal validation.

   In section Section 5.9 of this document, it is recommended to set the
   CD bit on an upstream query even when the incoming query arrives with
   CD=0.  This is for two reasons: it encourages a more predictable
   validation experience as only one validator is always doing the
   validation, and it ensures that all DNSSEC data that exists may be
   available from the local cache should a query with CD=1 arrive.

   As a matter of policy, it is possible to set the CD bit differently
   than suggested in Section 5.9.  A different choice will, of course,
   not always yield the benefits listed above.  It is beyond the scope
   of this document to outline all of the considerations and counter
   considerations for all possible policies.  Nevertheless, it is
   possible to describe three approaches and their underlying philosophy
   of operation.  These are laid out in the tables below.

   The table that describes each model has five columns.  The first
   column indicates the value of the CD bit that the resolver receives
   (for instance, on the name server side in an iterative resolver, or
   as local policy or from the API in the case of a stub).  The second
   column indicates whether the query needs to be forwarded for
   resolution (F) or can be satisfied from a local cache (C).  The third

Internet-Draft         DNSSEC Implementation Notes             July 2012


   column is a line number, so that it can be referred to later in the
   table.  The fourth column indicates any relevant conditions at the
   resolver: whether the resolver has a covering trust anchor and so on.
   If there are no parameters here, the column is empty.  The fifth and
   final column indicates what action the resolver takes.

   The tables differentiate between "cached data" and "cached RCODE=2".
   This is a shorthand; the point is that one has to treat RCODE=2
   (server failure) as special, because it might indicate a validation
   failure somewhere upstream.  The distinction is really between
   "cached RCODE=2" and "cached everything else".

   The tables are probably easiest to think of in terms of describing
   what happens when a stub resolver sends a query to an intermediate
   resolver, but they are perfectly general and can be applied to any
   validating resolver.

   Model 1: "always set"

   This model is so named because the validating resolver sets the CD
   bit on queries it makes regardless of whether it has a covering trust
   anchor for the query.  The general philosophy represented by this
   table is that only one resolver should be responsible for validation
   irrespective of the possibility that an upstream resolver may be
   present with trust anchors that cover different or additional QNAMEs.
   It is the model recommended in Section 5.9 of this document.

   Model 2: "never set when receiving CD=0"

   This model is so named because it sets CD=0 on upstream queries for
   all received CD=0 queries even if it has a covering trust anchor.
   The general philosophy represented by this table is that more than
   one resolver may take responsibility for validating a QNAME and that
   a validation failure for a QNAME by any resolver in the chain is a
   validation failure for the query.  Using this model is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.

   Model 3: "sometimes set"

   This model is so named because it sets the CD bit on upstream queries
   triggered by received CD=0 queries based on whether the validator has
   a trust anchor configured that covers the query.  If there is no
   covering trust anchor, the resolver clears the CD bit in the upstream
   query.  If there is a covering trust anchor, the resolver sets CD=1
   and performs validation itself.  The general philosophy represented
   by this table is that a resolver should try and validate QNAMEs for
   which is has trust anchors and should not preclude validation by
   other resolvers for QNAMEs for which it does not have covering trust
   anchors.  Using this model is NOT RECOMMENDED.

Appendix C.  Discussion of Trust Anchor Preference Options

   This section presents several different policies for validating
   resolvers to use when they have a choice of trust anchors available
   for validating a given answer.

C.1.  Closest Encloser

   One policy is to choose the trust anchor closest to the QNAME of the
   response.  For example, consider a validator configured with trust
   anchors for "example." and "zone.example."  When asked to validate a
   response for "www.sub.zone.example.", a validator using the "Closest



Weiler & Blacka         Expires January 14, 2013               [Page 19]

Internet-Draft         DNSSEC Implementation Notes             July 2012


   Encloser" policy would choose the "zone.example." trust anchor.

   This policy has the advantage of allowing the operator to trivially
   override a parent zone's trust anchor with one that the operator can
   validate in a stronger way, perhaps because the resolver operator is
   affiliated with the zone in question.  This policy also minimizes the
   number of public key operations needed, which is of benefit in
   resource-constrained environments.

   This policy has the disadvantage of giving the user some unexpected
   and unnecessary validation failures when sub-zone trust anchors are
   neglected.  As a concrete example, consider a validator that
   configured a trust anchor for "zone.example." in 2009 and one for
   "example." in 2011.  In 2012, "zone.example." rolls its KSK and
   updates its DS records, but the validator operator doesn't update its
   trust anchor.  With the "closest encloser" policy, the validator gets
   validation failures.

C.2.  Accept Any Success

   Another policy is to try all applicable trust anchors until one gives
   a validation result of Secure, in which case the final validation
   result is Secure.  If and only if all applicable trust anchors give a
   result of Insecure, the final validation result is Insecure.  If one
   or more trust anchors lead to a Bogus result and there is no Secure
   result, then the final validation result is Bogus.

   This has the advantage of causing the fewest validation failures,
   which may deliver a better user experience.  If one trust anchor is
   out of date (as in our above example), the user may still be able to
   get a Secure validation result (and see DNS responses).

   This policy has the disadvantage of making the validator subject to
   the compromise of the weakest of these trust anchors while making it
   relatively painless to keep old trust anchors configured in
   perpetuity.

C.3.  Preference Based on Source

   When the trust anchors have come from different sources (e.g.
   automated updates ([RFC5011]), one or more DLV registries
   ([RFC5074]), and manually configured), a validator may wish to choose
   between them based on the perceived reliability of those sources.
   The order of precedence might be exposed as a configuration option.

   For example, a validator might choose to prefer trust anchors found
   in a DLV registry over those manually configured on the theory that
   the manually configured ones will not be as aggressively maintained.



Weiler & Blacka         Expires January 14, 2013               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft         DNSSEC Implementation Notes             July 2012


   Conversely, a validator might choose to prefer manually configured
   trust anchors over those obtained from a DLV registry on the theory
   that the manually configured ones have been more carefully
   authenticated.

   Or the validator might do something more complex: prefer a sub-set of
   manually configured trust anchors (based on a configuration option),
   then trust anchors that have been updated using the RFC5011
   mechanism, then trust anchors from one DLV registry, then trust
   anchors from a different DLV registry, then the rest of the manually
   configured trust anchors.
