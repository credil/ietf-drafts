                   Intra-CDN Provider CDNi Experiment
         draft-chen-cdni-intra-cdn-provider-cdni-experiment-00

Abstract

   In [I-D.ietf-cdni-use-cases], the Inter-Affiliates CDN
   Interconnection use case is described.  In this scenario, a large CDN
   Provider may have several autonomous or semi-autonomous subsidiaries
   that each operates on their own CDN.  The CDN Provider needs to make
   these down-stream CDNs interoperate to provide a consistent service
   to its customers on the whole collective footprint.

   This document illustrates in details the CDNi experiment that has
   been carried out by China Telecom, and the lessons and experiences to
   CDNi standardization work.

Internet-Draft     Intra-CDN Provider CDNi Experiment          June 2012


1.  Introduction

   As a CDN service provider, China Telecom has established video CDNs
   in more than ten provinces in China.  These video CDNs, provided by
   different vendors, are relatively independent and only provide
   services to the end users of their own provinces.  Under this
   circumstance, if a Content Provider (CP) wants to provide services to
   multiple provinces, it needs to interact with CDNs in other provinces
   via interfaces which may support different standards.

   China Telecom launched the CDN interconnection trial network in 2011
   where CDNs from six different vendors (ZTE, Huawei, Cisco, etc.) were
   used to conduct the interconnection experiment in three provinces.
   This experiment aims at testing the scenario where the operator
   provides autonomous services via CDN interconnection in order to
   provide enhanced user experience.  It is noted that a simplification
   of the interconnection framework and the corresponding procedures
   would really improve the service and real-time viewing experience.

   This experiment is not intended to cover all of the use cases or the
   scenarios that are within the scope of CDNi work.  It simply provides
   some practical information gathered from the actual network
   experiment as a reference for the CDNi standardization work.  These
   CDN interconnection implementation experiments cover mostly the
   intra-operator interconnection scenarios.

2.1.  Experiment Configuration

   The interconnection of four CDNs in two provinces has been tested in
   this experiment.  Each province has two CDNs interconnected which are
   provided by different CDN vendors.  As depicted in Figure 1, CDN A1
   of Province A has contracts with service providers CP1 and CP2, and
   it acts as the content storage center of the nation.CDN B1 of
   Province B has contract with service provider CP3.  Meanwhile, CDN A1
   and CDN B1 are the sub-center CDNs of respective province, while CDN
   A2 and CDN B2 are the regional CDNs of respective province.  CDN A1
   and CDN B1 are deployed on the provincial backbone networks, while
   CDN A2 and CDN B2 are deployed on the MANs.  CDN A1 is the upstream
   CDN of CDN A2.  Services are provided to the end users by certain
   node in regional CDN, which is usually the geographically closest one
   to the end user.  However, if this desired node is overloaded,
   certain re-routing or load-balancing criteria could be used to choose
   another node.  CDN B1 and CDN B2 have similar deployment.  The
   provincial center CDN A1 and CDN B1 are interconnected with each
   other.  They do not have interconnection with the region CDNs in
   other provinces than themselves.  The regional CDNs of the respective
   provinces do not interconnect with one another either.

   China Telecom's CDN trial network offers two types of services:
   intra-province service (provided by CP2 and CP3) and inter-province
   service (provided by CP1).  Intra-province service is provided
   independently within the province without any interconnection with
   CDNs in other provinces.  When inter-province service is provided,
   content is ingested to the CDN in a single province and then
   distributed among the CDNs in all other provinces in the trial
   network.  In this experiment the inter-province service is ingested
   via CDN A1 node and the end users can obtain services through the
   CDNs that are located in their own provinces.

   The details of the experiment are as presented below:

   CP3 has contract with CDN B1 to provide content delivery service,
   e.g., IPTV service, to the end users in the Province B region.  CP3
   does not serve end users outside Province B. As an autonomous service
   by China Telecom, the content of this service is ingested into CDN
   B1.  As its downstream CDN, CDN B1 can delegate the content requests
   from end users to CDN B2 to perform content delivery.

   When CDN B1 receives the content request from EU B of Province B
   related to service provided by CP3, it redirects this request to CDN
   B2.  If CDN B2 has locally cached the copy of the content requested
   by EU B (cache hit case), it serves EU B directly by delivering the
   content to EU B. If CDN B2 does not have the content cached (cache
   miss case), it acquires the content from CDN B1.

   CP1 has contract with CDN A1 to provide content delivery service,
   e.g., OTT service, to end users within Province A and in the region
   of Province B. The content for this service is ingested from CDN A1.
   As for the cross-province routing, since it is within the same
   operator, static configuration can be used for dCDN selection.  In
   this experiment, the national content storage center CDN A1
   configures locally the relationship table of the end user's IP
   addresses and the loading condition of dCDNs.

   When CDN A1 receives a content request from EU B of Province B, it
   redirects the request to CDN B2 directly after it checks the local
   configuration table without going through multiple redirection
   processes like CDN A1->CDN B1->CDN B2.  If CDN B2 has locally cached
   a copy of the content that has been requested by EU B (cache hit
   case), it serves EU B directly by delivering the content to EU B. If
   CDN B2 does not have the content cached (cache miss case), it
   acquires the content from CDN B1.  If CDN B1 does not have the
   content cached either, it acquires the content from CDN A1.

   In this experiment, we use a content acquisition method that is
   different from the current CDNi work.  The method is based on Content
   Identification by using UniContentID that is defined to uniquely
   identify a content item.  A detailed description of this method is
   presented in Section 2.3.

2.2.  Logging

   Since in this experiment CDN interconnection is implemented within
   the scope of the same operator, charging-related operations via
   Logging Interface are not required.  Therefore, we have neither
   implemented nor tested any Logging operations.

2.3.  UniContentID

   In the current IETF CDNi standards, it is required to add the URL of
   original request and the URL in the process through CDNs in the
   request routing.  When cache is not hit, downstream CDN needs to use
   the information above to trace to the source.  The redirection flows

   are complex and the URL becomes very long which makes the
   implementation very difficult.

   In this experiment, the UniContentID as defined in
   [I-D.draft-chen-cdni-rr-content-acquisition] is used.  UniConentID is
   described by two tuple as (ProviderID, ContentID), e.g.
   ('iptv.netitv.com','01234567890123456789012345678900'), which can
   uniquely identify a content item.  We trace the content source
   according to the configuration table of ProviderID and the
   corresponding relationship between ProviderID and the IP address of
   upstream CDN.  It is our view that redirection and content
   acquisition are different routes.

   Figure 3 Request Routing and Content A Acquisition in Province B

   The Message sequence of Figure 3 is shown below in details.

   (1) End-User sends a request to the load balancer of CDN B1, i.e.  RR
   of CDN B1 for the content.The URL includes the parameter of CMSID and
   Domain(Please refer to [I-D. draft-chen-cdni-rr-content-acquisition]
   for corresponding definitions).

   (2) The RR of CDN B1 chooses an optimal RR of dCDN, i.e.  RR of CDN
   B2 for the End-User according to the load of dCDN and the IP Pool
   information.

   (3) End-User sends a request to the dCDN, i.e.  RR of CDN B2 for
   content acquisition.

   (4) RR of CDN B response to the End-User for the information of a
   delivery node i.e.  DN.

   (5) End-User sends a content request to the DN of CDN B2, the URL
   include the information of CMSID and Domain.  The DN of CDN B2
   analyses the ProviderID according the information of CMSID and Domain
   and looks up if the content exists in the cache according to the
   ProviderID and ContentID.  If the content is cached, the DN of CDN B2
   serves the End-User.  Otherwise, it skips to step (6).

   (6) The DN of CDN B2 looks up the configuration table and determines,
   according to the ProviderID, to acquire content uniquely identified
   by the ProviderID and ContentID from the DN of CDN B1.

   (7) The content in the DN of CDN B1 relays to the DN of CDN B2.

   (8) The relayed content is served by the DN of CDN B2 to the End-User
   via playing by downloading.

   A1.

   (8) The content in the DN of CDN A1 relays to the DN of CDN B1.

   (9) The content in the DN of CDN B1 relays to the DN of CDN B2.

   (10) The relayed content is served by the DN of CDN B2 to the End-
   User via playing for downloading.

2.4.3.  Test Results

   Based on the experiment model above, we have tested the CDN
   interconnection scenario in China Telecom's trial network where 1
   Gbps video traffic is not hit in the local cache and content
   acquisition is needed.  Performance tests are done by using the tools
   from Shineck and Spirent.  We have made such operations as fast
   forward, fast rewind and positioning play etc.  The testing results
   show that the response time is less than one second and the Max DF is
   less than 50msec.  Also we conducted the test for a period of six
   hours for stability tests through complex operation of fast forward,
   fast rewind, positioning play, etc.  The tests results show that the
   response time is less than one second and call loss is less that
   0.1%.  During the process of performance tests, the user requests the
   video on demand and Live contents through set-up box and conducts
   complex operation such as fast forward, fast rewind, positioning
   play, etc.  The program is smooth during the play.  The tests show
   that the CDN interconnection architecture for intra-operator video
   service is both feasible and efficient.

2.5.  Control

   In the IETF CDNi draft [I-D.murray-cdni-triggers], the uCDN controls
   the content operation, i.e., content adding, content purging and
   content modifying are performed through the control interface.  In
   this section, we describe a general content control flow by using CDN
   B1 and CDN B2 as an example which are used in this experiment.

   The Message sequence of Figure 5 is shown below in details.

   (1) CDN B1 sends a content management requests to the CDN B2
   including the content adding, content purging and content modifying.
   The content object can be live content, video on demand content or TV
   on demand.  The object of ContentDeployReq includes the URL address
   of XML description of the content object.

   (2) CDN B2 checks if the URL FTP address from CDN B1 is OK.  If the
   result is OK, CDN B2 responds positively (success) to the CDN B1.

   (3) CDN B2 login in the FTP of CDN B1 to achieve the XML data of
   content object and executes the operation according to the
   instruction of CDN B1, i.e., content adding, content purging or
   content modifying.

   (4) CDN B2 responds to the CDN B1 for the operation results, i.e.,
   with either a success or a failure result.

   (5) CDN B1 confirms to the CDN B2 for the operation result and
   registers the operation result.

3.  Lessons Learned

   The CDNi functionality tested in this experiment is applicable to
   intra-operator case only.  The inter-province service is ingested via
   CDN in one province and can be used throughout the entire trial
   network in two provinces.  During the initial stage of CDNi
   standardization, the most practical scenario to be considered is the
   interconnection of CDNs distributed in different geographical regions
   within one operator so as to enhance the consistency and continuity
   of the services provided by operators themselves.  Therefore, this
   experiment is intended to provide some experiences and references on
   CDNi networking to those operators who have initial requirements for
   internal CDN interconnection across different geographical regions.

3.1.  Simplification of operation procedures

   It is demonstrated that relatively simple methods can be used to
   simplify or optimize the Request Redirection, Content Acquisition,
   Content Pre-Positioning, Content Addition/Modification/Deletion
   procedures.  This is conducive to operators when they also act as
   service providers to serve the end users by fulfilling the
   requirements of of real-time service and demanding user experience.

3.2.  Redirection

   According to the HTTP/DNS-based Request Routing process defined in
   the current [I-D.ietf-cdni-framework], multiple redirection processes
   are needed to determine the final CDN node that is suitable to serve
   the end user.  This may be convenient in the case of two-level CDNs.
   But in case of large-scale CDN networking or complex CDN topology,
   this would cause serious delay.  The method provided in this
   experiment, i.e., the one based on the local configuration of the
   relationship table of end users' IP addresses and load situation of
   dCDNs, the uCDN, as the national content storage center, can quickly
   acquire and locate the final dCDN that is suitable to serve the end
   user.  By usingthis technique, the routing selection can be largely
   simplified especially when operators have large-scale internal
   networking.

3.3.  UniContentID

   In current IETF CDNi work [I-D.ietf-cdni-framework], the content
   acquisition by dCDN from uCDN is achieved via embedding the URL of
   the original request as well as that of the CDN the request is
   redirected to during the redirection process.  This would result in a
   very long URL.  Limited by the length and format of URL, such
   approach would cause serious delay and waste of resources.  In
   addition, it would be difficult to implement this, especially under



Chen, et al.            Expires December 30, 2012              [Page 14]

   the complex CDNi topology.

   The unique content identification (named UniContentID in this
   document) can be used to uniquely identify the content item ingested
   by the content provider.  The content source can also be resolved
   from UniContentID contained in the end user's content request for
   content acquisition.  Due to the uniformity of UniContentID format
   and its unchangeable nature during the transmission among CDNs, it
   can all along identify the content requested by the end user even
   after multiple forwards under complex CDNi topology.  Note that these
   introduce the need for defining a unique content identification for
   content item in CDNi framework.

3.4.  Metadata and Logging

   The metadata related to CDNi content delivery would be relatively
   simple.  Such policy information as content ingestion, content
   acquisition, etc. can be achieved by pre-configuration.  It is also
   due to the scope within one single operator, there is no need for
   charging-related operations via logging interface, which, as a
   result, can be simplified or may not even be supported.

3.5.  Inter-Operator CDN Interconnection

   For CDN interconnection across operators, if the operators are
   clearly aware of each other's CDN framework (according to their
   agreements), the method that is used in this experiment can also be
   utilized as a reference, i.e., for implementing end user's request
   redirection and content acquisition via maintaining the configuration
   table, which can also achieve relatively high content delivery
   efficiency.  For those operators who have complicated internal CDN
   topology or proprietary APIs or CDN topology, it is our view that it
   requires to seek solutions for dynamic request redirection and
   content acquisition.


4.  Security Considerations

   This experiment is carried out within a single operator.  No security
   issues are considered at this stage of the experiment.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo has no IANA Considerations.
