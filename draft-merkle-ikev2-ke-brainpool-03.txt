Internet-Draft   Brainpool Curves for IKEv2 Key Exchange   February 2013


1.  Introduction

   In [RFC5639], a new set of elliptic curve groups over finite prime
   fields for use in cryptographic applications was specified.  These
   groups, denoted as ECC Brainpool curves, were generated in a
   verifiably pseudo-random way and comply with the security
   requirements of relevant standards from ISO [ISO1] [ISO2], ANSI
   [ANSI1], NIST [FIPS], and SecG [SEC2].

   While the ASN.1 object identifiers defined in RFC 5639 allow usage of
   the ECC Brainpool curves in certificates and certificate revocation
   lists, their utilization for key exchange in IKEv2 [RFC5996] requires
   the definition and assignment of additional Diffie-Hellman Group
   Transform IDs in the respective IANA registry.  This document
   specifies tranform IDs for four curves from RFC 5639 as well as the
   encoding of the key exchange payload and derivation of the shared
   secret when using one of these curves.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  IKEv2 Key Exchange using the ECC Brainpool Curves

2.1.  Diffie-Hellman Group Transform IDs

   In order to use the ECC Brainpool curves for key exchange within
   IKEv2, the Diffie-Hellman Group Transform IDs (Transform Type 4)
   listed in the following table are to be registered with IANA
   [IANA-IKE2].  The parameters associated with these curves are defined
   in RFC 5639 [RFC5639].

                    +-----------------+--------------+
                    |      Curve      | Transform ID |
                    +-----------------+--------------+
                    | brainpoolP224r1 |     TBD1     |
                    |                 |              |
                    | brainpoolP256r1 |     TBD2     |
                    |                 |              |
                    | brainpoolP384r1 |     TBD3     |
                    |                 |              |
                    | brainpoolP512r1 |     TBD4     |
                    +-----------------+--------------+

                                  Table 1

   Test vectors for the groups defined by the ECC Brainpool curves are
   provided in Appendix A

2.2.  Using the Twisted Brainpool Curves Internally

   In [RFC5639] for each random curve, a "twisted curve" (defined by a
   quadratic twist, see [HMV]) is defined offering the same level of
   security but potentially allowing more efficient arithmetic due to
   the curve parameter A = -3.  The transform IDs listed in Table 1 also
   allow using the twisted curve corresponding to the specified random
   curve: points (x,y) of any curve listed in can be efficiently
   transformed to the corresponding point (x',y') on the twisted curve
   of same bit length - and vice versa - by setting (x',y') = (x*Z^2,
   y*Z^3) with the coefficient Z specified for that curve in [RFC5639].

2.3.  Key Exchange Payload and Shared Secret

   For the encoding of the key exchange payload and the derivation of
   the shared secret, the methods specified in [RFC5903] are adopted.

   In an ECP key exchange in IKEv2, the Diffie-Hellman public value
   passed in a KE payload consists of two components, x and y,
   corresponding to the coordinates of an elliptic curve point.  Each
   component MUST be computed from the corresponding coordinate using

   the FieldElement-to-OctetString conversion method specified in [SEC1]
   and MUST have bit length as indicated in Table 2.  This length is
   enforced by the FieldElement-to-OctetString conversion method, if
   necessary, by prepending the value with zeros.

   Note: The FieldElement-to-OctetString conversion method specified in
   [SEC1] is equivalent to applying the conversion between integers and
   octet strings of Section 6 of [RFC6090] after representing the field
   element as integer in the interval [0, p-1].

   +-----------------+------------------------+------------------------+
   |      Curves     |   Bit length of each   |    Bit length of key   |
   |                 |   component (x or y)   |    exchange payload    |
   +-----------------+------------------------+------------------------+
   | brainpoolP224r1 |           224          |           448          |
   |                 |                        |                        |
   | brainpoolP256r1 |           256          |           512          |
   |                 |                        |                        |
   | brainpoolP384r1 |           384          |           768          |
   |                 |                        |                        |
   | brainpoolP512r1 |           512          |          1024          |
   +-----------------+------------------------+------------------------+

                                  Table 2

   From these components, the key exchange payload MUST be computed as
   the concatenation of the x and y coordinates.  Hence, the key
   exchange payload has the bit length indicated in Table 2.

   The Diffie-Hellman shared secret value consists only of the x value.
   In particular, the shared secret value MUST be computed from the x
   coordinate of the Diffie-Hellman common value using the FieldElement-
   to-OctetString conversion method specified in [SEC1] and MUST have
   bit length as indicated in the Table 2.

3.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC5996] apply accordingly.

   In order to thwart certain active attacks, the validity of the other
   peer's public Diffie-Hellmann key recovered from the received key
   exchange payload needs to be verified.  In particular, the
   recomendations and requirements of [IKE_DH_Req] MUST be observed.
   For the curves listed in Table 1, Section 2.3 of [IKE_DH_Req]
   applies.

   The confidentiality, authenticity and integrity of a secure
   communication based on IKEv2 is limited by the weakest cryptographic
   primitive applied.  In order to achieve a maximum security level when
   using one of the elliptic curves from Table 1 for key exchange, the
   key derivation function, the algorithms and key lengths of symmetric
   encryption and message authentication as well as the algorithm, bit
   length and hash function used for signature generation should be
   chosen according to the recommendations of [NIST800-57] and
   [RFC5639].  Furthermore, the private Diffie-Hellman keys should be
   selected with the same bit length as the order of the group generated
   by the base point G and with approximately maximum entropy.

   Implementations of elliptic curve cryptography for IKEv2 may be
   susceptible to side-channel attacks.  Particular care should be taken
   for implementations that internally use the corresponding twisted
   curve to take advantage of an efficient arithmetic for the special
   parameters (A = -3): although the twisted curve itself offers the
   same level of security as the corresponding random curve (through
   mathematical equivalence), an arithmetic based on small curve
   parameters may be harder to protect against side-channel attacks.
   General guidance on resistence of elliptic curve cryptography
   implementations against side-channel-attacks is given in [BSI1] and
   [HMV].

4.  IANA Considerations

   Before this document can become an RFC, IANA is required to assign
   Transform Type 4 (Diffie-Hellman Group Transform) IDs to the groups
   specified in Table 1 for the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2)
   Parameters registry [IANA-IKE2].  For the new entries in the table of
   the Transform Type 4 repository, a reference to Section 2.3 of
   [IKE_DH_Req] shall be included in the column named "Recipient Tests"
   indicating the required checks for the other peer's Diffie-Hellman
   public keys.

   Another I-D is being submitted for publication as RFC [BP_IKE]
   requesting assignment for the same groups in the corresponding
   registry for IKEv1; in order to keep the registries for IKEv1 and
   IKEv2 in accordance, IANA is requested to assign the same values in
   both registries.

5.  Intellectual Property Rights

   Although, the authors have no knowledge about any intellectual
   property rights which cover the general usage of the ECP groups
   defined herein, implementations based on these domain parameters may
   require use of inventions covered by patent rights.  In particular,
   techniques for an efficient arithmetic based on the special
   parameters of the twisted curves as explained in Section 2.1 may be
   covered by patents.
