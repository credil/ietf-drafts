                  IPv6 Prefix Sharing Problem Use Case
            draft-sarikaya-aps-prefix-sharing-usecase-00.txt

Abstract

   In case a given fixed network is policy converged with the mobile
   network, i.e if Policy for Convergence is deployed, host specific
   quality of service and charging can be applied to the hosts
   connecting using the wireless local area network access or some other
   means.  When local or visiting hosts are assigned their addresses
   using IPv6 prefix sharing, the edge router is unable to provide host
   specific quality of service and charging.  We explain both stateless
   and stateful address assignment cases.

Internet-Draft           Prefix Sharing for FMC             October 2013


1.  Introduction

   A number of use cases have been documented that exhibit the issue of
   uniquely identifying a host among many hosts sharing the same IP
   address [I-D.boucadair-intarea-host-identifier-scenarios].  However,
   all these use cases involve IPv4 and Network Address Translation
   (NAT) [RFC2663] or tunneling.

   The use case described in this document belongs to Policy for
   Convergence (P4C) area in Fixed Mobile Convergence (FMC).  P4C deals
   with applying 3GPP Policy and Charging Control (PCC) to the hosts in
   a fixed IP network, including the User Equipment (UE) accessing the
   fixed IP network from home or from a hot spot [TS23.203], [TR23.896]
   using wireless local area network.

   IPv6 addressing of hosts in a fixed IP network is described in
   [TR177].  For Routed Residential Gateways (RG) it is the RG that
   makes the assignments.  Stateful (DHCPv6) or stateless address
   assignment (SLAAC) techniques are supported.  For the stateless
   address assignment, RG uses DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (PD) [RFC3633].
   RG is the Requesting Router and the edge router, aka Broadband
   Network Gateway (BNG) is the Delegating Router.  A different prefix
   is requested for each access loop, e.g. home or for each host.  For
   stateful address assignment, DHCP server assigns a different 64-bit
   prefix per access loop or per host.


2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Policy for Convergence Operation

   3GPP Policy and Charging Control (PCC) is based on interaction
   between the policy server, aka Policy and Charging Rules Function
   (PCRF), which sends to the Policy Enforcement Point Function (PCEF)
   the Quality of Service (QoS) and Charging rules for supporting Online
   accounting (i.e. pre-paid).  The IP Connectivity Access Network (IP-
   CAN) session, defined in [TS23.203], represents the control session
   identified by the association between an host, identified by its
   identity, an IP network, identified by one IPv4 address and/or an
   IPv6 prefix together.  In addition, if available, it can be
   identified also by the 3GPP Packet Data Network connection.  The IP
   CAN session exists as long as host IP addresses/prefix are
   established and announced to the PCEF and the PCRF.  The IP-CAN

   session is initiated by PCEF when PCEF becomes aware of the IP
   address/prefix assigned to the UE, possibly as soon as it is assigned
   to the host.  In fixed network, the edge router acts as a Policy
   Enforcement Point Function (PCEF).

   When a Residential Gateway, RG, is attached to the network, e.g. when
   it is switched on, in IPv6 prefix delegation scenario, it receives an
   IPv6 prefix.  The Edge router, acting as PCEF is aware of both the
   IPv6 prefix assigned and the identity of the line connecting the home
   to its operator network, which is the line ID.  Hence an IP-CAN
   session identified by RG ID and IPv6 prefix is established.

   When a host, e.g.  Local_Host_1 in Figure 1 attaches to a routed
   Residential Gateway, RG uses DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation as Requesting
   Router (RR) to request a prefix, possibly of size /60 for home
   network.  The edge router acts as the Delegating Router (DR).  So the
   edge router assigns the IPv6 prefix to the RG.  Note that the host
   can be both UE and fixed device.

   In this scenario, the edge router, acting as PCEF initiates an IP
   Connectivity Access Network (IP-CAN) session with the policy server,
   a.k.a.  Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) to receive the
   Quality of Service (QoS) parameters and Charging rules.  The edge
   router provides to the PCRF the IPv6 Prefix assigned to the host and
   User Equipment (UE) an ID which in this case has to be equal to the
   RG specific home network line ID.

   In case of stateless address auto configuration, the host sends a
   Router Solicitation message to RG and RG sends a Router Advertisement
   with an IPv6 prefix, the home network prefix.  It is assumed that the
   IPv6 prefix is different from those assigned to the RG.  Since it is
   assigned by router/PCEF there is no problem.  In addition the prefix
   can be different for each host, it is not a problem.

   The host creates an 128-bit IPv6 address using this prefix and adding
   its interface id.  Having completed the address configuration, the
   host can start communication with the Internet to use the Internet
   services.

   As we explain in Section 4, no specific IP-CAN session can be
   assigned to Local_Host_1, and consequently the QoS and accounting
   performed will be based on RG subscription.

   Another host, e.g.  Visiting Host 1 attaches to RG and also
   establishes an IPv6 address using the home network prefix.  Edge
   router is not involved with this and all other such address
   assignments.

   As in previous scenario no specific IP-CAN session/sub-session can be
   assigned to that given host, and consequently the QoS and accounting
   performed will be based on RG subscription.

   The above operation steps assumed that stateless address auto
   configuration (SLAAC) is used.  DHCPv6 based stateful address
   assignment can also be used.  In case of routed RG, RG can be DHCPv6
   relay agent communication with a DHCPv6 server in the operator's IP
   network.  DHCPv6 server in assigning IPv6 addresses to the hosts uses
   a method where /64 prefixes are never shared between hosts in
   different home networks.

   In DHCPv6 stateful address assignment scenario as in the previous two
   scenarios, no specific IP-CAN session/sub-session can be assigned to
   the hosts and likewise the QoS and accounting performed will be based
   on RG subscription.

4.  Issue Description

   In case of Local_Host_1 in Section 3, the edge router, acting as
   PCEF, becomes aware of the presence of the new IPv6 Address when the
   host initiates the communication with Internet, but it is not able to
   associate this IPv6 address with the host's ID.  The edge router may
   associate the traffic to the IPv6 home prefix previously assigned to
   RG and in such way, the traffic is associated to the IP-CAN session
   established for the RG.  So no specific IP-CAN session can be
   assigned to that given host, and consequently the QoS and accounting

   performed will be based on RG subscription.

   In case of Visiting Host 1 in Section 3, the edge router acting as
   PCEF is not aware of the IPv6 address assigned to the host and PCEF
   is not able to start a new IP-CAN session/sub-session for such host
   different from those initiatiated for the RG.  As in previous
   scenario, no specific IP-CAN session/sub-session can be assigned to
   that given host, and consequently the QoS and accounting performed
   will be based on RG subscription.

   Also, in the case of DHCPv6 based address assignment and if DHCP
   server uses the same prefix for all hosts in Figure 1, the edge
   router will associate the traffic to the IP-CAN session established
   for the RG and this will result in the hosts not getting host
   specific quality of service or charging.

   The RG does not signal to the edge router the IP6 address assigned to
   a host, e.g. visiting host 1 or 2, so the edge router acting as
   Policy and Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF) is not able to start
   an 3GPP IP-CAN session/sub-session for the given UE ID, IPv6 Address.

   UE id given to the mobile network in Section 3 is the home network
   line id which is the same for all the hosts in the home network.

   In case stateless address auto configuration is used, the issue we
   described here can be avoided by a new protocol between RG and edge
   router.  RG needs to signal host address (Local_Host_1 or Visiting
   Host 1) to the edge router.  Edge router needs to take this as a
   trigger to establish a new IP-CAN session/subsession specific to the
   attaching host.

   In case stateful address configuration is used, a similar protocol
   solution is needed.  Due to the stateful operation RG can easily
   detect the termination of the address assignment and thus decide more
   precisely when to start communicating with the edge router to trigger
   the edge router to establish a new IP-CAN session/subsession specific
   to the attaching host.
