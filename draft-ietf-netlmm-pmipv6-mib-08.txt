1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


2.  Overview

2.1.  The Proxy Mobile IPv6 Protocol Entities
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] is an extension to the Mobile
   IPv6 (MIPv6) protocol which facilitates network-based localized
   mobility management (NETLMM) for IPv6 nodes in a PMIPv6 domain.
   There are three types of entities envisaged by the PMIPv6 protocol.

      mobile node (MN): In the PMIPv6 context the term mobile node
      is used to refer to an IP host or router whose mobility is
      managed by the network.

      local mobility anchor (LMA): Local Mobility Anchor is the
      home agent for the mobile node in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.
      It is the topological anchor point for the mobile node's home
      network prefix(es) and is the entity that manages the mobile
      node's binding state.  The local mobility anchor has the
      functional capabilities of a home agent as defined in Mobile
      IPv6 base specification [RFC3775] with the additional
      capabilities required for supporting Proxy Mobile IPv6
      protocol as defined in the PMIPv6 specification [RFC5213].

      mobile access gateway (MAG): Mobile Access Gateway is the
      entity on an access router that manages the mobility-related
      signaling for a mobile node that is attached to its access
      link.  It is responsible for tracking the mobile node's
      movements to and from the access link and for signaling the
      mobile node's local mobility anchor.

Internet Draft                  pmip6MIB                    October 2011


   This document defines a set of managed objects (MOs) that can be used
   to monitor and control PMIPv6 entities.

2.2.  Terminology
   The terminology used in this document is consistent with the
   definitions used in the Mobile IPv6 protocol specification [RFC3775]
   and in NETLMM Goals document [RFC4831].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Proxy Mobile IPv6 Monitoring and Control Requirements

   For managing a PMIPv6 entity it is necessary to monitor
   the following:
       o capabilities of PMIPv6 entities
       o signaling traffic due to PMIPv6 signaling
       o binding related details (at LMA and MAG)
       o binding related statistics (at LMA and MAG)


4.  MIB Design

   The basic principle has been to keep the MIB as simple as possible
   and at the same time to make it effective enough so that the
   essential needs of monitoring and control are met.

   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 Management Information Base(PMIPV6-MIB) extends
   the Mobile IPv6 Management Information Base(MIPV6-MIB).  [RFC4295].
   It is assumed that PMIPV6-MIB will always be implemented in
   conjunction with the MOBILEIPV6-MIB [RFC4295].  The PMIPV6-MIB uses
   the textual conventions defined in the INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001] and
   IP-MIB [RFC4293].

   The PMIPV6-MIB is composed of the following groups of definitions:

       - pmip6Core: a generic group containing objects that are
         common to all the Proxy Mobile IPv6 entities. Objects
         belonging to this group will be implemented on the
         corresponding Proxy Mobile IPv6 entity. pmip6BindingCacheTable
         belongs to this group.
       - pmip6Mag: this group models the mobile access gateway
         service. Objects belonging to this group have the "pmip6Mag"

         prefix and will be implemented on the corresponding MAG.
       - pmip6Lma: this group models the local mobility anchor
         service. Objects belonging to this group have the "pmip6Lma"
         prefix and will be implemented on the corresponding LMA.
       - pmip6Notifications: defines the set of notifications that
         will be used to asynchronously monitor the Proxy Mobile
         IPv6 entities.

   The tables contained in the above groups are as follows:
       - pmip6BindingCacheTable: models the Binding Cache on the local
         mobility anchor.
       - pmip6MagProxyCOATable: models the Proxy Care-of Addresses
         configured on the egress interfaces of the mobile access
         gateway.
       - pmip6MagMnIdentifierTable: provides a mapping from the
         MAG-internal pmip6MagMnIndex to the mobile node identifier.
       - pmip6MagMnLLIdentifierTable: provides a mapping from the
         MAG-internal pmip6MagMnLLIndex to the corresponding interface
         of the mobile node link layer identifier.
       - pmip6MagHomeNetworkPrefixTable : contains the Home Network
         Prefixes assigned to interfaces of all mobile nodes attached
         to the MAG. Each interface is distinguished by the attached
         mobile node's identifier (MN-Identifier) and the link layer
         identifier (MN-LL-Identifier).
       - pmip6MagBLTable: models the Binding Update List (BL) that
         includes Proxy MIPv6 related information and is maintained by
         the mobile access gateway.
       - pmip6MagMnProfileTable: contains the mobile node's policy
         profile that includes the essential operational parameters that
         are required by the network entities for managing the mobile
         node's mobility service.
       - pmip6LmaLMAATable: contains the LMA Addresses that are
         configured on the local mobility anchor. Each LMA Address acts
         as a transport endpoint of the tunnel between the local
         mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway.
       - pmip6LmaMnIdentifierTable: provides a mapping from the
         LMA-internal pmip6BindingMnIndex to the mobile node identifier.
       - pmip6LmaMnLLIdentifierTable: provides a mapping from the
         LMA-internal pmip6BindingMnLLIndex to the corresponding
         interface of the mobile node link layer identifier.
       - pmip6LmaHomeNetworkPrefixTable : contains the list of Home
         Network Prefixes assigned to the connected interfaces of the
         mobile nodes anchored on an LMA.

4.1  Textual Conventions

   A Proxy Mobile IPv6 Textual Conventions MIB module containing
   Textual Conventions to represent commonly used Proxy
   Mobile-IPv6 management information is defined.  The intent
   is that these TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS (TCs) will be imported and used
   in PMIPv6 related MIB modules that would otherwise define their own
   representation(s).

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  These
   are the tables and objects and the corresponding
   sensitivity/vulnerability:
      pmip6MagStatus:
      pmip6LmaStatus:
         The value of these objects is used to enable or disable
         the PMIPv6 functionality on the corresponding PMIPv6 entity.
         Access to these MOs may be abused to disrupt the communication
         that depends on the PMIPv6 functionality.
      pmip6MobileNodeGeneratedTimestampInUse:
      pmip6FixedMagLinkLocalAddressOnAllAccessLinksType:
      pmip6FixedMagLinkLocalAddressOnAllAccessLinks:
      pmip6FixedMagLinkLayerAddressOnAllAccessLinks:
      pmip6MagEnableMagLocalRouting:
      pmip6MagHomeNetworkPrefixLifeTime:
      pmip6LmaMinDelayBeforeBCEDelete:
      pmip6LmaMaxDelayBeforeNewBCEAssign:
      pmip6LmaTimestampValidityWindow:
      pmip6LmaHomeNetworkPrefixLifeTime:
         Access to the above MOs may be abused to misconfigure PMIPv6
         entities and disrupt communications.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      pmip6LmaHomeNetworkPrefixType:
      pmip6LmaHomeNetworkPrefix:
      pmip6LmaHomeNetworkPrefixLength:
         The above address-related objects may be considered to be
         particularly sensitive and/or private.
      pmip6MagMnIdentifier:
      pmip6MagMnLLIdentifier:
      pmip6LmaMnIdentifier:
      pmip6LmaMnLLIdentifier:

Internet Draft                  pmip6MIB                    October 2011


      pmip6MagProfMnIdentifier:
         The above MN Identifier-related MOs may be used to identify
         users. These may be considered to be sensitive and/or private.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA should assign
         1. a base arc in the 'mib-2' (standards track) OID
            tree for the 'pmip6TCMIB' MODULE-IDENTITY defined in the
            PMIPV6-TC-MIB.
         2. a base arc in the 'mib-2' (standards track) OID
            tree for the 'pmip6MIB' MODULE-IDENTITY defined in the
            PMIPV6-MIB.
