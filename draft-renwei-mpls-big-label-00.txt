              Encoding of Big Labels in MPLS Label Stacks
                   draft-renwei-mpls-big-label-00.txt

Abstract

   This document specifies encoding and encapsulation methods for MPLS
   big labels.  Big labels are required for accessing virtual networks
   in data centers by using, for example, BGP/MPLS IP VPNs.  Data center
   virtualization encapsulation methods and protocols such as VXLAN,
   NVGRE and NVO3 are being standardized to support a few millions of
   virtual networks, but the currently label format can support up to
   one million of labels.  When the BGP/MPLS IP VPN method, for example,
   is used by an enterprise/customer to access its corresponding virtual
   networks, more than one million of labels are required to map VPN
   labels and Virtual Network Identifiers.

1.  Introduction

   Network virtualization and server virtualization are being designed
   and deployed in data center networks, and new data encapsulation
   methods and protocols are being defined and specified, for example,
   VXLAN, NVGRE and NVO3.  The general idea is to add a new virtual
   network header so that a physical network can be used to support
   millions (16M) of virtualized overlaid networks.  Network overlay
   virtualization has placed a new requirement on the access method to
   such huge number of virtulized networks.

   BGP/MPLS IP VPNs, as specified in RFC 2547 and RFC 4364, provide a
   market-proven technology and solution for end-to-end IP VPNs.  In BGP
   /MPLS IP VPNs, all the customer sites are connected to the service
   provider networks through PE-CE link.  It is desirable to extend the

   BGP/MPLS scheme so that customers can access their virtualized
   networks hosted in a data center by using BGP/MPLS IP VPNs.

   In the data plane of BGP/MPLS IP VPNs, the customer VPN/VRF instances
   are represented by an MPLS label (VPN label) locally assgined by the
   PE connecting to CE.  Since MPLS labels are 20 bits long, a PE can
   maximally support 1 million VPNs/VRFs, but the PE is required to
   support 16 millions of virtual networks that are being standardized
   in VXLAN, NVGRE and NVO3.  When BGP/MPLS IP VPNs are extended to
   access virtualized networks in data centers, [I-D.draft-renwei-l3vpn-
   big-label] specifies use cases and solutions to use big labels to
   represent the VPN and maps them to virtual network instances.

   This document specifies the label format and encoding methods of big
   labels in the MPLS label stack of [RFC 3032].

2.  Motivations

   In [I-D.draft-renwei-l3vpn-big-label], several use cases are
   described so that an enterprise/customer can use provider-provided
   BGP/MPLS IP VPN to access its corresponding virtual network hosted in
   a data center.

   The virtual network may be provided by VXLAN, NVGRE or NVO3.  In all
   such network virtualization frameworks, 16 millions of virtual
   networks may be supported.  This implies that up to 16 millions of
   enterprises/customers can have their own data centers hosted by data
   center service providers.  On the other hand, BGP/MPLS IP VPNs have
   been used widely by the service providers.  This imposes a new
   requirement of using BGP/MPLS IP VPN protocols and solutions to
   access the virtual networks in data centers.  One problem and
   obstacle of using BGP/MPLS IP VPN to access virtual networks is that
   there are not enough labels to do one-one mapping between VPN label
   space and virtual network identification space.

3.  Review of MPLS Label Stack

   The label stack is represented as a sequence of "label stack
   entries".  Each label stack entry is represented by 4 octets as
   follows:


    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ Label
   |                Label                  | Exp |S|       TTL     | Stack
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ Entry

                       Label:  Label Value, 20 bits
                       Exp:    Experimental Use or for QoS, 3 bits.
                       S:      Bottom of Stack, 1 bit
                       TTL:    Time to Live, 8 bits


   For BGP/MPLS IP VPN, the VPN labels share the same format as all
   other common MPLS labels as defined as in the above figure.

4.  Big Labels

   A PE device uses VPN labels to find the associated VRFs for VPN
   packet forwarding.  Since there are potentially 16 millions of
   virtual networks, 20 bits label are not sufficient; we need to
   specify a new type of labels: big labels.  A big label is an
   extension to the MPLS label format of RFC 3032 so that the label
   space is bigger than the 20-bit space with the minimal space being 16
   millions of labels.

Internet-Draft           Encoding of Big Labels                June 2013


   There are several options to define big labels.  One option is to
   totally re-define the label format; A second option is to extend the
   length of label entry; A third option is, for the sake of backward
   compatibility, to add a new field to the common label entry specified
   in RFC 3032.

   The exact format of the third option is defined as follows:


    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |            Big Label Indicator        | Exp |S|       TTL     |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |            Big Label Value                                    |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                       Exp:    Experimental Use or for QoS, 3 bits
                       S:      Bottom of Stack, 1 bit
                       TTL:    Time to Live, 8 bits




   The Big Label Indicator is a reserved MPLS label.  The currently
   unassigned reserved label range is 4-6 and 8-12.  We will temporarily
   use label 8 for big label indicator, but the final value will be
   assigned by IANA.  The Big Label Value is a 32-bit value.

   When an MPLS LSR receivs an MPLS packet, it reads out the MPLS label.
   If the MPLS label is a Big Label Indicator, it will use the
   subsequent 32-bit value as the MPLS label for the forwarding purpose.

   All the EXP, S and TTL are also applicable to the Big Label Value as
   follows:

      EXP: Experimental Use or for QoS, 3 bits

      S: Bottom of Stack, 1 bit

      TTL: Time to Live, 8 bits

5.  IANA Considerations

   This draft will request IANA to assign a reserved label for Big Label
   Indicator.

6.  Security Considerations

   This draft does not add any additional security implications to the
   BGP/MPLS IP VPNs.  All existing authentication and security
   mechanisms for BGP and MPLS still apply.
