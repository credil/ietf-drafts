Abstract

   This draft describes a method for improving the quality of experience
   (QoE) for real-time video and other multimedia services using
   features and functions of the end-point only, that is, without
   requiring any upgrade to the network transport infrastructure.  Any
   upgrade to the network transport infrastructure not only incurs
   significant costs, these are also time consuming and technology-
   dependent.  Therefore, these QoE improvement mechanisms are
   significantly more attractive to both network operators and service
   providers.

Internet-Draft  End-point based Multimedia QoE Management      July 2013


1.  Introduction

   This Internet Draft describes a method for improving the quality of
   experience (QoE) for real-time video and other multimedia services
   without requiring any upgrade to the network transport
   infrastructure.

   It is recognized that network quality of service (QoS) based
   management of multimedia services has a very valid role.  However,
   such management techniques are orthogonal to endpoint based QoE
   management, and thus are outside the scope of this Internet Draft.

   This Internet Draft defines a common set of QoE parameters that are
   applicable for HTTP, Websocket or RTP sessions.  Hence, these
   parameters would be used for controlling the QoE for any real-time
   video and other session-based multimedia services over an Internet-
   protocol (IP) based network.  The multimedia session may be displayed
   on a mobile communication terminal, a tablet/phablet, a laptop, a
   television, etc.  This method facilitates a high-quality user
   experience with minimal user input for interactively controlling the
   QoE.  Any user input may be through a touch sensitive device or
   verbal commands.  This method may be applicable for improving QoE for
   both multicast and OTT (over the top) service scenarios, and may
   apply equally to transit/intermediate network elements.

   Depending on the particular protocol (RTP/UDP vs. HTTP/TCP) different
   tools from the toolkit may be applied.

1.1.  Method of controlling QoE for real-time video and other multimedia
      services

   Data transport protocols for the Internet have been designed to be
   agnostic to the data type.  There has been minimal attention given to
   the requirements for time-critical and high priority services, such
   as real-time communications, etc.  This has lead to such services
   providing unpredictable and inconsistent user experiences, and
   thereby leading to lost revenue for the service provider.

   Network architects have often used quality of service (QoS) as the
   metric for objectively determining the level of service to be
   provided.  From a customer perspective the QoS measure is not
   satisfactory as it does not take into consideration the subjective
   experience; instead it is necessary to measure the quality of
   experience (QoE).  QoE is the user experience that can be quantified
   in terms of the subjective experience, and it depends on various
   factors, including the type of content, expectations of the consumer
   of the content, the device on which the content is -consumed- and the
   environment in which the content is consumed.  Admittedly, these are



Khasnabish, et al.       Expires January 8, 2014                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft  End-point based Multimedia QoE Management      July 2013


   indeed subjective measures.  However, there are standardization
   efforts (in particular in ITU-T) to evaluate and quantify QoE as
   there is a real need for such quantitative metrics by service
   providers.

   This Internet Draft proposes a method for transport impairment
   independent control of QoE for multimedia services.  The display of
   the multimedia session could be in a mobile communication terminal, a
   tablet, a laptop, a television, etc.  This proposal relates to
   facilitating high-quality user experience with minimal user input
   (could be through a touch sensitive device or a verbal command) for
   interactively controlling the QoE.  This method is applicable to
   operator managed services and to unmanaged (i.e., OTT - over the top)
   service.  Additionally, this may apply to intermediate network
   elements as well.  The focus of this proposal is for the QoE
   management to be transport independent, and hence it is applicable to
   a range of media transports, including HTTP, WebSocket or RTP
   sessions.

   In order to improve quality it is common practice to focus on
   improving network infrastructure (bandwidth increase, etc.).
   However, our proposal enables improvements in quality by utilizing
   transport independent QoE management.

3.  Preliminary Survey of existing QoE methods

3.1.  Measurement Techniques for Network Quality

   Currently there are two measurement techniques: (a) Network-based
   Measurement, and (b)Content Inspection.

   ITU-T and other standards bodies have been developing standards to
   address QoE measurement in the area of multimedia/IPTV [2], [3].

   Below, these measurement techniques have been categorized.  These
   techniques vary according to the performance, complexity and
   feasibility.  It is left to service providers and network operators
   to determine which of these to be used, and how to combine these
   according to different needs, multimedia content type, network, end
   user equipment and service type.

3.1.1.  Network-based measurements

   These are objective network metrics which thus do not require
   accessing and inspecting the content.  These metrics (one-way delay,
   packet loss and jitter) are uses in QoS assessment as well.  However,
   in the context of QoE the intent is to predict multimedia quality
   based on these metrics.

Internet-Draft  End-point based Multimedia QoE Management      July 2013


3.1.2.  Content Inspection

   Content inspection is applied at various levels, and these are
   described below.

3.1.2.1.  Audio/Video Content Analysis

   There are objective and subjective content analysis techniques that
   are used to determine the distortion that may be introduced at a
   given stage in the end-to-end multimedia delivery system.  These
   content analysis techniques may be based on the following approaches:
   (a) Non-reference (NR)-- the NR approaches assess quality without
   knowledge of the original source, (b) Reduced-reference (RR) -- the
   RR approach uses an alternative channel to send parameters
   corresponding to the delivered content, thus enabling evaluation of
   content quality, and (c) Full-reference (FR) -- the FR method
   requires the original content to be available in order to assess
   quality.  Hence, this approach is not practical for most delivery
   scenarios.

3.1.2.2.  Other Analysis Techniques at the Bitstream level

   By inspection of the bitstream it is possible to extract the
   following parameters from the headers that can be used to assess
   quality: (a) Timestamp accuracy/error, (b) PCR jitter/clock accuracy,
   (c) Media Encapsulation and Packetization (MEP) Header.  The above
   parameters require deep packet inspection, but they do not require
   decoding of the audio/video sequences

3.2.  Metrics Used for QoE Assessment

   In this section we shall provide details of metrics for QoE
   assessment that are currently used in the industry.  In [4] the
   metrics used for QoE assessment have been categorized as being either
   -direct- or -indirect-.  These will be described below.

3.2.1.  Direct Metrics

   These metrics directly affect the user's perception of the audio/
   video experience. peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), structural
   similarity (SSIM) and video quality metric (VQM) are three commonly
   used objective metrics for quality analysis.  For subjective analysis
   the commonly used methodology is the ITU-T Recommendation BT500 [5].

   ITU-T have defined the mean opinion score (MOS)[6] which is a meta-
   metric which uses values form several other metrics.  Due to the
   cumbersome nature of subjective analysis techniques there has been
   much work done to map objective metrics to MOS, for example, there's

Internet-Draft  End-point based Multimedia QoE Management      July 2013


   a mapping of PSNR to MOS.

3.2.2.  Indirect Metrics

   There are indirect metrics which do not directly correlate to the
   multimedia content quality.  Instead they correspond to artifacts
   that determine the user's satisfaction of the multimedia service.
   These indirect metrics include the following.

   o  Responsiveness to user requests -- time delay from user request to
      response by the system.  Example -- responsiveness to pausing
      video.

   o  Start-up time -- time delay from user requesting content to
      receiving the content.

   o  Delivery synchronization -- when several users access a given
      content do they all receive the content at the same time?

   o  Live content delay -- time delay from content being available at
      the encoder to it being received by the user.  For live streaming
      this is an important requirement.  This is applicable to
      progressive downloading as well.

   o  Picture freezing -- due to mismanagement of buffers.  One example
      is buffer underflow.

   o  Multimedia synchronization -- the accuracy at which audio, video
      and associated data (including subtitles) are synchronized has a
      significant impact on the QoE.  For example, if audio is earlier
      or later than video by 160ms, then this will lower the QoE.

   o  Content/Channel Switching time -- time delay from the user
      requesting content/channel switching to the display of the
      requested content.

   o  Blocking artifact -- consistency of the data in one frame.

   o  Mosaic -- if packet is lost during transport, and it can not be
      recovered by the client, mosaic will appear.


4.  Proposed Toolkit for Managing QoE

   We propose a toolkit for managing QoE for a multimedia system.
   P.NBAMS [2] is a quality assessment model that uses bitstream
   information in addition to prior knowledge of the media stream as
   well as client buffer information.  P.NAMS [3] is another quality

Internet-Draft  End-point based Multimedia QoE Management      July 2013


   assessment model that uses only prior knowledge of the media stream
   as well as the client buffer information.  In both of these
   Recommendations Figure 1e illustrates the "Embedded operation mode"
   where QoE management is performed at the client/end-point.

   Our proposal similarly aims to perform QoE management at the client/
   end-point and thus it can be described as being performed in a
   Transport Independent Fashion (XIF).  Once a session starts with a
   specific transport bandwidth, the endpoint's objective is to maintain
   persistently a consistent QoE even when the session bandwidth
   fluctuates.  The smartness or intelligence resides at the endpoint,
   and the use of virtualization makes the simplistic implementation of
   the operation a technically feasible one.  This is shown in Figure-1

                         Independent Fashion (XIF)

   Media content is received over an IP based network.  However, it is
   expected that the actual transport would include any of the following
   -- RTP/UDP, HTTP/TCP, HTTP/UDP, etc.  HTTP/UDP is relevant if the
   roundtrip link condition is poor or RTT (round-trip delay time) is
   long, etc.  A QoE Management Agent in the endpoint will receive the
   media content.  The management agent has a toolkit of "tools" which
   will be used to maintain the QoE.  This toolkit includes the
   following tools

   o  Multi-layer Elastic Virtualized Buffer Stack

   o  Jitter Buffer

   o  Error resilience methods

   o  Transport Rate Clinging

   o  Transport rate adaption

   o  Endpoint Resource Reallocation (among audio, video, messaging,
      etc. services)

   o  Adaptation, e.g., depth for image, surroundings of sound, etc.

   o  Virtualized Display

   o  Use of trick play methods

   o  Synchronization in multicast

   Each of these shall be described in detail further down in this
   section.  However, it is noted that there may be other tools which
   could also lead towards improving QoE.  Any such tools may also be
   added as appropriate.  With the aid of these tools the QoE management
   agent will maintain the QoE based on policy as set for the given
   endpoint.  Resource pre-positioning policy information will be
   available in the local database.  The QoE model will be applied to
   determine the QoE, and the metrics will be signaled to the
   presentation agent.  In parallel with QoE evaluation, the media which
   has been "refined" by the QoE management agent is sent to the
   decoding and control agent where the content is decoded.  The decoded
   data is then sent to the presentation agent.  The decoding and
   control agent receives QoE signal information from the presentation
   agent.  With this information the decoding and control agent is able
   to apply any remedial steps in order to maintain QoE.

4.1.  Multi-layer Elastic Virtualized Buffer Stack

   Virtualization of buffer allows increase of the effective available
   buffer space (depth) over the amount that is actually physically
   available.  This can be achieved, for example, by assigning
   temporarily larger than actually required physical buffer/memory
   chunk so that during process execution/operation a larger memory
   block can be temporarily used (must make sure that the allocation/
   operations do not overlap or interfere with each other, as required
   by virtualization).  This helps improve performance without extra
   costs.  This is equivalent to vertical expansion of the buffer space.

   When "Elasticity" is added to the virtualized buffer, it allows
   incorporation of Elastic behavior (i.e. capability to expand and
   contract seamlessly in order to maintain a certain output rate) in
   the operation of the buffer module.  This is equivalent to horizontal
   expansion of the buffer space.

4.2.  Jitter Buffer

   Jitter is the variation of packet latency over a network.  The
   severity of jitter can vary significantly depending on network type
   and current conditions.  Therefore, a device called jitter buffer is
   commonly introduced in the receiver.  The jitter buffer can de-jitter
   the incoming stream of packets and provide a constant flow of data to
   the decoder.

4.3.  Error resilience and concealment methods

   Packet loss is due to either random loss and network congestion.  In
   first situation, error resilience methods including Automatic Repeat
   reQuest (ARQ) and Forward Error Correction (FEC) may also be used to
   maintain QoE.  Unequal Error Correction (UEP) which is based on FEC
   may be more commonly used.  The original data can be classified into
   several levels, the most important data has highest priority.
   Different priority has different redundancy.

   With network congestion, ARQ and FEC are not suitable as they could
   make the situation worse.  Hence, different measures should be
   adopted according to network characteristics.  When receiving
   multimedia communication payloads, the receiver may evaluate network
   statistics, including packet loss , consecutive packet loss, delay,
   jitter etc. from this data it is possible to determine if the network
   is congested.  The receiver sends these parameters to the sender, and
   the sender can adjust the packet delivery strategy in real time based
   on these parameters: if the network is congested, sender can modify
   it's encode rate or send rate to decrease congestion, and make sure
   the protected data from FEC or ARQ is under the total rate.

Internet-Draft  End-point based Multimedia QoE Management      July 2013


   Moreover, the network condition is unknown in the initial state of
   the communication, then sender may take its strategy supposing the
   network condition is poor.  Packet Loss Concealment (PLC) is another
   tool that may be used for this purpose.  The other method is using
   two or more encoders.  When one frame is lost, the frame from another
   encoder can be used.  It is important to process these two streams
   switchover.  The delay of the encoders should be known for
   synchronization.  Mute frame can be added to align the start time of
   frames.  When switching between two streams, smooth the joins of
   different frames.

4.4.  Transport rate clinging

   The intent of transport rate clinging is to maintain a steady rate of
   bit stream (e.g., media).  The brute force method is to introduce
   blank packets in the event the required media data rate goes lower
   than a given threshold.  Instead of using this brute force method, it
   is possible to reallocate the bandwidth to other sub-processes
   through appropriate virtualization.

4.5.  Transport rate adaption

   During multimedia transport, the network may not be stable.  The
   available bandwidth may be time-varing.  In order to maintain a
   consistent QoE, transport rate should change according to the
   available bandwidth.  If the transport rate is too high, packet loss
   will occur.  Otherwise, bandwidth resource is waste.

4.6.  Endpoint Resource Reallocation

   Endpoint resource reallocation involves dynamically adjusting
   virtualized resources among sub-sessions, audio, video, text/
   messaging, etc.  The aim is to ensure that these different types of
   sub-sessions maintain a consistent QoE.  A flowchart for dynamically
   adjusting virtualized resources among sub-sessions (audio, video,
   text/messaging, etc.) is presented in Figure 2.

4.7.  Adaptation

   Adaptation (of image/picture depth) requirements may depend on the
   type of scene/picture, e.g., Talking head, sports, action movie, and
   so on.  The number of GOPs/frames required to recover from any losses
   would depend on the type of scene/picture.

4.8.  Virtualized displays

   The goal here is to manage the real-estate of the screen.  Depending
   on the intended resolution and screen size at which a given piece of
   media content is generated there is some opportunity to maintain the
   QoE for, say, a lower sized display.

4.9.  Use of trick play methods

   Various mechanisms from trick play can be utilized for slow/fast and
   Look-Ahead/Reverse adjustment of the scene.  Such methods provide the
   means to catch up with "real-time" in the event that there has been a
   major hiccup in delivery.  Voice recognition may be used to determine
   if catch up with "real-time" is required.  However, if network
   condition or the environment of the endpoint is too poor to guarantee
   the quality of voice data, the sender can generate text message from
   the actual voice by voice recognition module, and send text message
   to receiver.  Network condition can feedback by packet loss, jitter,
   delay etc.  The environment of the endpoint include voice output
   device, ambient noise, and so on.  The receiver may choose to
   directly present the text message, or it can use a text-to-speech
   module to reconstruct the audio signal, and then present it.

4.10.  Synchronization in multicast

   In multicast system, the server usually send I-frames or
   independently decodable frames periodically, the endpoint system
   display may be out of sync because of the different access times.  A
   re-encode module can be added to the multicast system where it backs
   up the non-I frames from multicast server and re-encode them to new I
   frames, these new I frames use smaller bandwidth than the original I
   frames .  When client join multicast group, it send request to
   server, the server can choose the latest I frame, send it and the
   following frames to client.  Meanwhile, the server send the
   information to tell the client how to display, including the started
   time of the first I frame and the distance to the current frame which
   is send to other clients that already in the multicast group, then
   client can play these frames quickly until synchronize with other

6.  IANA considerations

   This Internet Draft includes no request to IANA.


7.  Conclusions

   We have presented a tool-kit based approach for improving the quality
   of experience (QoE) for video and other multi-media services in a
   transport impairment independent fashion (XIF).  This method is both
   flexible and expandable.  As the technologies evolve, the existing
   techniques (in the tool-kit) can be updated, and many other new and
   improved techniques can be easily incorporated in the tool-box
   without incurring any significant overheads.

Appendix A.  Appendix

A.1.  Factors Influencing QoE

   The QoE depends on several factors.  This includes the type of
   service, type of content and the terminal device intended for use of
   the content.

A.1.1.  Service

   For any given entertainment service there is a specific minimum level
   of service expected by the viewer.  This would determine the MOS.
   One could generalize and state that if a payment is made for an
   entertainment service then there is a much higher expectation of QoE
   than if it were to be a "free" service.  In the free service category
   one would also include ad-driven services where the viewer's QoE
   expectations are lower.

A.1.2.  Content

   The type of content will influence the user's QoE expectations.  The
   requirements for drama are different to those for sports content.
   The QoS parameters contributing towards the MOS would be different
   depending on the type of content.

A.1.3.  Terminal Device Used for Consuming Content

   The viewer's QoE expectations vary depending on the terminal device
   used for viewing the content.  For example, the expectations of a
   viewer would be much higher if the content were being viewed on a 50-
   inch HDTV display as opposed to on a 4-inch smart phone screen.

A.1.4.  View/Listener Characteristics

   Each human view or listener can have a different impact on the QoE
   measurement.  In order to make the QoE measurement practical from an
   operations perspective it is important to take this (impact of the

   listener and viewer) out of the QoE measurement.  This can be done by
   taking as wide a sample of viewers and listeners in the MOS
   calculation stage.  [See ITU-T Ref.]

A.2.  Range of Network Architectures

   TBD

A.2.1.  Managed vs. Unmanaged Networks

   Today with network based media services there is a clear distinction
   made between how such services are provided depending on whether it
   is over a managed or unmanaged network.  A managed network has the
   ability to configure, manage and monitor the network, thereby
   enabling greater control over how data is transported, and who has
   access to the data.  It is also possible to generalize to some extent
   by stating that managed networks support reservation of bandwidth for
   each user.  Unmanaged networks, by implication, do not have such
   reservation capabilities.

A.2.2.  Unicast vs. Multicast Delivery

   Unicast delivery services pose less of a problem with respect to
   maintaining QoE when compared to multicast delivery.  The problems
   experiences with multicast delivery can be as complex as those for
   unmanaged networks.  This document will focus on both forms of
   delivery -- unicast and multicast, as well as on managed and
   unmanaged networks.

A.2.3.  Range of Service Offerings

A.2.3.1.  Traditional Closed Network operators

   Traditionally, network operators, such as cable MSOs, satellite
   operators, "Telcos" and terrestrial operators have, controlled the
   networks over which services are provided.  They either own the
   network infrastructure, or they have close business relationships
   with the owners of the network infrastructure.  Starting from
   traditional (i.e., non-IP) delivery methods they have migrated to
   providing IPTV services.  Other than the fact that IP and invariably
   UDP protocols have been introduced to the network stack there has
   been no fundamental shift in the service offerings.

A.2.3.2.  Over-the-Top Service Offerings

   More recently, companies like Netflix and Apple have started to
   provide media service to subscribers using network infrastructures
   which are neither owned or in which they have any business

   relationship.  These services are termed "over-the-top."  The
   traditional network operators (cable, satellite, Telco and
   terrestrial) have also started to provide over-the-top media
   services.  These over-the-top media services use broadband delivery,
   and for the traditional network operators this is a component of
   their overall offering.  Over-the-top services cannot assume any
   reservation of bandwidth, and hence such services are provided over
   unmanaged networks.
