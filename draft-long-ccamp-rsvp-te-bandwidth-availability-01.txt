           RSVP-TE Signaling Extension for Bandwidth availability 
           draft-long-ccamp-rsvp-te-bandwidth-availability-01.txt 


Abstract 

   Packet switching network usually contains links with variable 
   bandwidth, e.g., copper, radio, etc. The bandwidth of such link is 
   sensitive to external environment. Availability is typically used 
   for describing the link during network planning. This document 
   describes an extension for RSVP-TE signaling for setting up a label 
   switching path (LSP) in a Packet Switched Network (PSN) network 
   which contains variable bandwidth link by introducing an optional 
   availability field in RSVP-TE signaling.

1. Introduction 

   The RSVP-TE specification [RFC3209] and GMPLS extensions [RFC3473] 
   specify the signaling message including the bandwidth request for 
   setting up a label switching path in a PSN network. 

   There are some data communication technologies that allow seamless 
   change of maximum physical bandwidth. For example, in mobile 
   backhaul network, microwave links are very popular for providing 
   connection of last hops. In case of heavy rain, to maintain the link 
   connectivity, the microwave link will lower the modulation level 
   since demodulating lower modulation level need lower signal-to-noise 
   ratio (SNR). This is called adaptive modulation technology [EN 302 
   217]. However, lower modulation level also means lower link 
   bandwidth. When link bandwidth reduces by modulation down-shifting, 
   high priority traffic can be maintained, while lower priority 
   traffic is dropped. Similarly the cooper links may change their link 
   bandwidth due to external interference.  

   The parameter, availability [G.827, F.1703, P.530], is often used to 
   describe the link capacity during network planning. Assigning 
   different availability classes to different types of service over 
   such kind of links provides more efficient planning of link capacity. 
   To set up a LSP across these links, availability information is 
   required for the nodes to verify bandwidth satisfaction and make 
   bandwidth reservation. The availability information should be 
   inherited from the availability requirements of the services 
   expected to be carried on the LSP, voice service usually needs ''five 
   nines'' availability, while non-real time data packets may needs four 
   or three nines availability. Since different service types may need 
   different availabilities guarantee, multiple <availability, 
   bandwidth> pairs may be required when signaling.  

   To fulfill LSP setup by signaling in these scenarios, this document 
   specifies the following extension:

     o A new SENDER_TSPEC object is defined which includes multiple 
        bandwidth profiles with different availability. This object is 
        an extension on the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC defined by [RFC6003] 
        which support multiple bandwidth profile TLVs, but limited in 
        the scope of Ethernet. The extension uses the object 
        generically, and amends availability information in the 
        bandwidth profile TLV. 

         

2. Overview 

   A PSN tunnel may span one or more links in a network. To setup a 
   label switching path (LSP), a PE node may collect link information 
   which is spread in routing message, e.g., OSPF TE LSA message, by 
   network nodes to get know about the network topology, and calculate 
   out a LSP route based on the network topology, and send the 
   calculated LSP route to signaling to initiate a PATH/RESV message 
   for setting up the LSP. 

   In case that there is(are) link(s) with variable bandwidth in a 
   network, a <bandwidth, availability> requirement list should be 
   specified for a LSP. Each <bandwidth, availability> pair in the list 
   means a bandwidth with specified availability is required. The list 
   could be inherited from the result of service planning for the LSP. 

   When a PE node initiates a PATH/RESV signaling for setting up the 
   LSP, the PATH message should carry the <bandwidth, availability> 
   requirement list as bandwidth request, and the intermediate node(s) 
   will allocate the bandwidth resource for each availability 
   requirement from the remaining bandwidth with corresponding 
   availability. An error message may be returned if any <bandwidth, 
   availability> request cannot be satisfied.

     Traffic Parameters: 

       This field includes the traffic parameters information. The 
         format is different for different C-Type.

3.2. FLOWSPEC Object 

   The FLOWSPEC object (Class-Num = 9, Class-Type = TBD) has the same 
   format as the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object. 

3.3. Signaling Process 

   The source node initiates PATH messages including one or more 
   Bandwidth Profile TLVs with different availability value in the 
   SENDER_TSPEC object. Each Bandwidth Profile TLV specifies the 
   portion of bandwidth request with referred availability requirement.

Internet-Draft    RSVP-TE - Bandwidth Availability           July 2013 
    

   The destination nodes check whether it can satisfy the bandwidth 
   requirement by comparing each bandwidth requirement inside the 
   SENDER_TSPEC objects with the remaining link sub-bandwidth resource 
   with respective availability guarantee when received the PATH 
   message.  

     o   If all bandwidth requirements can be satisfied, it should 
        reserve the bandwidth resource from each remaining sub-
        bandwidth portion to set up this LSP. Optionally, the higher 
        availability bandwidth can be allocated to lower availability 
        request when the lower availability bandwidth cannot satisfy 
        the request. 

     o   If at least one bandwidth requirement cannot be satisfied, it 
        should generate PathErr message with the error code "Traffic 
        Control Error" and the error value "Bad Tspec value" (see 
        [RFC2205]). 

4. Security Considerations 

   This document does not introduce new security considerations to the    
   existing RSVP-TE signaling protocol.
