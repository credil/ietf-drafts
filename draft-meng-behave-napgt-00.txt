                       draft-meng-behave-napgt-00

Abstract

   Currently, if an internal server and hosts are behind NAT, they
   cannot share a global IP address except adding lots of static NAPT
   rule configuration.  Because if a server wants to provide a service
   by constant port(i.e. HTTP and FTP) , the destination port of packet
   sent by an external client should not be changed any time when it
   crosses NAT.  This document specifies a new method to assign NAPT
   global address and port, aiming to solve the problem that internal
   servers and hosts cannot share less global IP addresses.

1.  Introduction

   With the depletion of IPv4 addresses, many operators have begun to
   deploy NAPT in their network.  But NAPT has many defects.  For
   example, a server is placed in the internal network, and an external
   client attempt to access the server through HTTP.  Dynamic NAPT
   cannot be used for translation, because translation MUST keep the
   consistency of the internal port and external port (PORT:80 should
   not be changed).  It is an issue causing a public IP address being
   fixed to a server only, but not for other users to access, resulting
   in a waste of resources.

   It seems that STATIC NAPT is a near-perfect solution to deal with
   this issue.  But if there are a lot of services provided by a server
   in the internal network, many STATIC NAPT rules should be configured.
   It increases the complexity of configuration without a corresponding
   increase in functionality.  Meanwhile, limited rule resources will be
   consumed.

   Present solution is changing the configuration due to user
   complaints.  A user does not know his IP address global or local.
   During global IP address time, he can access the server placed in his
   home from external.  Until one day, he cannot do that because he get
   local IP address only.  He is not satisfied and complain to the
   operator.  Operator has to assign global IP address for him and still
   assign local IP address for other users.  Operator distinguishes him
   from others by embedding tags into the user data.

   Now, through the variant of traditional NAPT translation, we can
   achieve sharing a global IP address among a server and hosts placed
   in the same internal network.  It is called NAPGT (Network Address
   Port Group Translation).

2.  Convention and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Scenarios

   There can be a typical scenario if NAT is involved.

   In this scenario, a server and several hosts are behind NAT.  NAT has
   only a global IP address.  NAT needs to let client access to server
   without affecting any hosts accessing to the internet.


                                           Address Pool:
                                           {202.1.1.1 }

                                                       |  +--------+

                                                       |--+  host  +
                                                          +--------+

4.  Configuration

   The NAPGT needs to be configured in NAT.  Port-ranges MUST be
   specified in NAT pool, such as '1-1024','7000-7100'.  It means that a
   collection of ports MUST be binding use for server.  The rest of
   ports can be assigned to hosts.

   Static rules MUST be configured for server.  Rules for hosts has no
   special requirement.

5.  Mapping Item

   To achieve client accessing server behind NAT by HTTP or FTP, mapping
   item MUST be generated in advance.
