    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6"/> introduces a
      "Unified Server" - a DHCP server capable of servicing both DHCPv6 <xref
      target="RFC3315"/> and DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 requests. This enables the
      provisioning of DHCPv4 based configuration to IPv6 connected clients
      over IPv6 only transport networks.</t>

      <t>One of the benefits of the DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 based approach is that
      it allows the dynamic leasing of IPv4 addresses to clients, based on
      existing mechanisms for address lease management available in DHCPv4
      servers. This can make much more efficient use of remaining public IPv4
      addresses than static pre-allocation based approaches as only IPv4
      clients which are currently active need to be allocated addresses.</t>

      <t>Shortages of available public IPv4 addresses mean that it is not
      always possible for operators to allocate a full IPv4 address to every
      active customer simultaneously. This problem may be particularly acute
      whilst the operator is in the migration phase from a native IPv4 network
      to a native IPv6 network with IPv4 provided as an overlay service. Such
      migrations are likely to increase the requirement on public IPv4
      addresses so that both existing and transition networks can be provided
      for.</t>

      <t>IPv4 address sharing provides a way of easing this problem. A shared
      IP address is a single IPv4 address which is allocated to a number of
      clients simultaneously. The clients differentiate themselves through the
      use of layer 4 source ports, which are unique for each client sharing a
      single IPv4 address, known as a Port Set ID (PSID).</t>

      <t>The client will generally utilize these restricted source ports by
      implementing a NAPT44 function, translating traffic from the original
      source address and unrestricted port range to the allocated shared IPv4
      address and unique restricted port range.</t>

      <t>This technique is also referred to as "extended" or "A+P" addressing
      <xref target="RFC6346"/>.</t>

      <t>Due to the nature of address sharing in this manner, it is only
      suitable for some very specific architectures, such as those described
      in <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-map"/> and <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6"/>. Use of shared addressing in
      other, more traditional deployment architectures must be avoided due to
      the fundamental incompatibilities of assigning a the same /32 IPv4
      address to multiple clients such as when they are attached to the same
      layer 2 segment. Some rules for the use of the allocated shared dynamic
      address are provided in Section 4 below.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC2131"/> describes DHCPv4, providing a method for
      dynamically allocating IPv4 addresses to clients based on three
      different mechanisms:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Automatic Address Allocation</t>

          <t>Dynamic Address Allocation</t>

          <t>Manual Address Allocation</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This memo describes how the dynamic allocation mechanism can be
      adapted for allocating shared IPv4 addresses for use by DHCPv4 over
      DHCPv6 clients and Unified Servers. The approach is referred to as
      "shared, dynamic" addressing throughout this memo.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Functional Overview">
      <t>From a functional perspective, shared, dynamic allocation by the
      unified server is quite similar to the normal DHCPv4 server dynamic
      allocation process. The underlying difference is that the unified server
      MAY allocate the same IPv4 address to more than one DHCPv4 over DHCPv6
      client simultaneously, providing that each address allocation also
      includes a range of layer 4 source ports unique to that address (i.e.
      each PSID may only be allocated once per /32 address).</t>

      <t>To enable this, the DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 client needs to be extended to
      implement OPTION_PORTPARAMSV4 (described below). This is used to
      indicate to the Unified server that it is capable of supporting shared,
      dynamic addressing and also for conveying the allocated PSID.</t>

      <t>The server must be extended to implement OPTION_PORTPARAMSV4 so that
      clients able to support shared, dynamic address leasing can be
      identified and so that shared, dynamic addresses can be allocated and
      their leases maintained. The server must also manage unique client
      leases based on the address and PSID tuple, instead of just IPv4
      address.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Client-server Interaction">
      <t>The following sections describe the changes to the client and server
      necessary to implement dynamic, shared address allocation.</t>

      <section title="Allocating a Shared, Dynamic IPv4 Address">
        <t>Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC2131"/> describes the client-server
        interaction for allocating an IPv4 address. The process described
        below detail the required changes for the dynamic, shared addressing
        mechanism.</t>

        <t>The following message flow is transported within the DHCPv6
        OPTION_BOOTP_MSG message.</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>The client constructs its DHCPv4 DHCPDISCOVER message
            (transported within the DHCPv6 BOOTPRELAYV6 message). The
            DHCPDISCOVER message MUST include the following options: <list
                style="symbols">
                <t>A client Identifier (constructed as per <xref
                target="RFC4361"/></t>

                <t>OPTION_PORTPARAMSV4 (described below)</t>
              </list>The client MAY insert a non-zero value in the PSID-Len
            field within OPTION_PORTPARAMSV4 to indicate the preferred size of
            the restricted port range allocation to the unified server.</t>

            <t>Each Unified server which receives the DHCPDISCOVER message
            containing OPTION_PORTPARAMSV4 within the BOOTPRELAYV6 message may
            respond with a DHCPOFFER message which contains an available IPv4
            address in the 'yiaddr' field. The response MUST also include
            OPTION_PORTPARAMSV4 containing a restricted port-range. If the
            received OPTION_PORTPARAMSV4 field contains a non-zero PSID-Len
            field, the Unified server MAY allocate a port set of the requested
            size to the client (depending on policy).</t>

            <t>The client evaluates all received DHCPOFFER messages and
            selects one based on the configuration parameters received (e.g.
            the size of the offered port set). The client then sends a
            DHCPREQUEST containing a server identifier and the corresponding
            OPTION_PORTPARAMSV4 received in the DHCPOFFER message.</t>

            <t>The server identified in the DHCPREQUEST message (via the
            siaddr field) creates a binding for the client. The binding
            includes the client identifier, the IPv4 address and the PSID.
            These parameters are used by both the server and the client to
            identify the lease referred to in any future DHCP messages. The
            server responds with a DHCPACK message containing the
            configuration parameters for the requesting client.</t>

            <t>The client receives the DHCPACK message with the configuration
            parameters. The client MUST NOT perform a final check on the
            address, such as ARPing for a duplicate allocated address.</t>

            <t>If the client chooses to relinquish its lease by sending a
            DHCPRELEASE message, the client MUST include the original client
            identifier, the leased network address and the allocated
            restricted source ports included in OPTION_PORTPARAMSV4.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Reusing a Previously Allocated Shared, Dynamic IPv4            address">
        <t>If the client remembers the previously allocated address and
        restricted port range, then the process described in section 3.2 of
        <xref target="RFC2131"/> must be followed. OPTION_PORTPARAMSV4 MUST be
        included in the message flow, with the client's requested port set
        being included in the DHCPDISCOVER message.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Client Usage of a Shared Address">
      <t>As a single IPv4 address is being shared between a number of
      different clients, the allocated shared address is only suitable for
      certain functions. The client MUST implement a function to ensure that
      only the allocated layer 4 ports of the shared IPv4 address are used for
      sourcing new connections.</t>

      <t>The client MUST apply the following rules for any traffic to or from
      the shared /32 IPv4 address:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Only port-aware protocols MUST be used.</t>

          <t>All connections originating from the shared IPv4 address MUST use
          a source port taken from the allocated restricted port range.</t>

          <t>The client MUST NOT accept inbound connections with destination
          ports outside of the allocated restricted port range.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In order to prevent addressing conflicts which could arise from the
      allocation of the same IPv4 addreses, the client MUST NOT configure the
      received restricted IPv4 address on-link.</t>

      <t>In the event that the DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 configuration mechanism
      fails for any reason, the client MUST NOT configure an IPv4 link-local
      address <xref target="RFC3927"/>(taken from the 169.254.0.0/16
      range).</t>

      <t>The mechanism by which a client implements these rules is outside of
      the scope of this document.</t>

    <section title="Additional Changes to [RFC2131] Behaviour">
      <t>The following change to the behaviour described in <xref
      target="RFC2131"/> is also necessary in order to implement dynamic

    <section title="Specfic Behaviour for Softwire Clients">
      <t>[DISCUSSION NOTE: Should the following section be moved into a
      separte draft as it is more softwire specific?]</t>

      <t>Current mechanisms suitable for extending to incorporate dynamic,
      shared IPv4 addressing include <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-map"/>
      and <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6"/>. For these mechanisms to
      function, the operator needs information about the clients allocated
      IPv4 address, PSID and also the /128 IPv6 prefix which the client will
      use as the IPv4 in IPv6 tunnel endpoint. This binding information is
      used by other functional elements in the operator's network (e.g. a
      softwire tunnel concentrator) for correctly routing traffic to and from
      clients.</t>

      <t>For the shared, dynamic address allocation model, a two-way
      communication model is necessary so that the Unified Server can indicate
      to the client the preferred prefix to use for binding the received IPv4
      configuration and sourcing tunnel traffic.</t>

      <t>As the Unified server is managing the leasing of DHCPv4 to clients,
      it holds the most accurate IPv4 lease information available in the
      network. It follows that the unified server should also hold information
      about the /128 IPv6 prefixes in use by active clients as tunnel
      endpoints, so that the unified server contains a single comprehensive
      dynamic IPv4/IPv6 binding table.</t>

      <t>To achieve this, the client also needs to inform the Unified server
      of the /128 prefix that it has bound the IPv4 configuration to.</t>

      <t>To provide this function, the DHCPV4oDHCPv6 client MAY implement
      OPTION_DHCPV4_O_DHCPV6_SADDR (defined below). This option is included by
      the client within OPTION_BOOTP_MSG messages and is used alongside the
      DHCPv4 request process.</t>

      <t>The option comprises of two IPv6 prefixes (with associated prefix
      length fields):</t>

      <t><list hangIndent="19" style="hanging">
          <t hangText="cipv6-prefix-hint">Sent by the server to indicate to
          the client the preferred prefix to bind IPv4 configuration to. If
          this field contains a prefix, the client MUST perform a longest
          prefix match betweeen cipv6-prefix-hint and all prefixes configured
          on the device. The selected prefix MUST then be used to bind the
          received IPv4 configuration to. If this field is left blank, then
          the client MAY select any valid IPv6 prefix.</t>

          Unified Server of the IPv6 prefix that it has bound the IPv4

      OPTION_BOOT_MSG transactions between the client and the server.</t>
