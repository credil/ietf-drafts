1.  Introduction

   Multiparty multimedia applications are getting great attentions in
   the telecom and datacom world.  Such applications are QoS-demanding
   and can therefore benefit from the MPLS traffic engineering
   capabilities based on dynamic computation and establishment of MPLS
   LSPs to meet with application-specific QoS requirements.  P2MP-TE
   [RFC4875] defines a procedure to set up point-to-multipoint LSPs from
   sender to receivers.  This procedure works very well if the senders
   have a priori knowledge of all its receivers.  Sometimes multicast
   data streams are required to get transported over both IP networks
   and MPLS networks, but MPLS networks have no priori knowledge about
   senders and receivers.  In the IP networks, the receivers can join/
   leave a multicast distribution tree by PIM Join/Prune messages, and
   thus the multicast distribution tree is essentially receiver-driven.
   When such PIM Join/Prune messages arrive at an MPLS network border,
   we need a procedure to initiate and set up the multicast distribution
   tree in MPLS.  This document extends RSVP-TE for initiation and setup
   of P2MP and MP2MP LSPs driven by receivers.

1.1.  Motivation

   IP multicast distribution trees are initiated by receivers and
   dynamic by nature.  IP multicast applications are also sensative to
   bandwidth, especially in the area of residential IPTV services, where
   the delivery of multicast contents to several hundreds of thousands
   of IPTV receivers assumes the appropriate level of quality.

Internet-Draft      Receiver-Driven Multicast RSVP-TE          July 2013


   Current source-driven P2MP LSP establishment, as defined as in
   [RFC4875], assumes a priori knowledge of receiver locations, and the
   LSP signalling is initiated and driven by the data sender (headend).
   The priori knowledge of receiver locations is obtained either through
   static configuration or by using another protocol to discover such
   receivers.  On the other hand, [RFC4875] does not address the MP2MP
   LSPs.  Actually, there is no straightfoward way to support MP2MP
   applications by using P2MP LSP unless full-meshed P2MP LSPs are set
   up independently and separately.

   The receiver-driven extension to RSVP-TE described in this document
   will support both P2MP LSPs and MP2MP LSPs.  Moreover, it does not
   require the sender to know all the receivers' locations a priori.
   The protocols for discovery of receivers are not needed.  It provides
   a natural mechanism to interwork with PIM dynamically.

1.2.  Terminology

   The following terms are used in this document:

   o  Sender: Sender refers to the Originator (and hence the Sender) of
      the content/payload, as defined in [RFC2205].

   o  Receiver: Receiver refers to the Receiver of the content/payload,
      as defined in [RFC2205].

   o  Upstream: The direction of flow from content Receiver toward
      content Sender, as defined in [RFC2205].

   o  Downstream: The direction of flow from content Sender toward
      content Receiver, as defined in [RFC2205].

   o  Path-Sender: The sender of RSVP PATH messages, with no correlation
      to the direction of content/payload flows.  Its flow direction is
      irrelevant to that of Sender defined above.  All other control
      messages discussed in this document will use this as the
      reference.

   o  Path-Receiver: The receiver of RSVP PATH messages, with no
      correlation to the direction of content/payload flows.

   o  Path-Initiator: The Path-Sender that originated a RSVP PATH
      message.  This is different from Path-Sender in that an
      intermediate node can be a Path-Sender, but such an intermediate
      node cannot create and initiate the RSVP PATH message.  A Path-
      Initator is a Path-Sender, but a Path-Sender doesn't have to be a
      Path-Initiator.

Internet-Draft      Receiver-Driven Multicast RSVP-TE          July 2013


   o  Path-Terminator: The Path-Receiver that does NOT propagate the
      Path message any further.  This is different from Path-Receiver in
      that an intermediate node can be a Path-Receiver, but such an
      intermediate node will propagate the Path message to the next hop.

   o  Root: A router where a multcast LSP tree is rooted at.  Data
      enters the root and then is distributed to leaves along the P2MP/
      MP2MP LSP.

1.3.  Overview

   Although the receiver-driven extensions to RSVP-TE as defined in this
   document use the existing sender-driven syntax, there are important
   semantic differences that need to be defined for correct
   interpretation and interoperability.  In the receiver-driven context,
   we inverted the semantics of RSVP-TE messages, while keeping the
   syntax unchanged as much as possible.  We will use mRSVP-TE to
   represent the RSVP-TE with receiver-driven extensions described in
   this document.

   The following are some key differences that are specific to the
   receiver-driven paradigm:

   o  The leaf router: the router that receives data/content/payload.
      In this document, the leaf router will initiate PATH messages.  In
      some sense, the leaf router and the receiver mean the same thing.
      The term "receiver-driven" also means "leaf-driven".

   o  L2S Destinations: routers where user data payload traffic enters
      the LSP.  L2S means Leaf-to-Source.  The source is the sender or
      root of a multicast stream.

   o  RSVP P2MP PATH messages traverse from receivers to the root.

   o  RSVP P2MP RESV messages traverse from the root to the leaf routers
      of the P2MP tree strcuture.

   o  For P2MP LSP, a RSVP RESV message received by a router is
      interpreted as a successful resource reservation made by the
      upstream node.

   o  For MP2MP LSP, a RSVP RESV message received by a router is
      interpreted as successful resource reservation made by the
      downstream node.

   o  After a PATH message is received on an interface for P2MP LSP,
      label allocation on that interfaces is done prior to sending the
      corresponding RSVP PATH message upstream.

Internet-Draft      Receiver-Driven Multicast RSVP-TE          July 2013


   o  After a PATH message is received on an interface for MP2MP LSP,
      label allocation on that interfaces is done prior to sending the
      corresponding RSVP RESV messages downstream.

   o  For P2MP LSP tree structures, a node receiving a RSVP PATH message
      first decides if this RSVP PATH message will make the said node a
      branch LSR or not.  If it is not a branch LSR, it is a transit
      LSR.  In the case that it will become a transit LSR because of
      this PATH message, it will, before sending the RSVP PATH message
      upstream, allocate required bandwidth on the interface on which
      the RSVP PATH message is received.  The upstream node can send
      traffic soon after successfully reserving resources on the
      downstream link, on which the RSVP PATH message SHOULD be
      received.  In the case that the node is already a branch or a
      transit node before it receives the PATH message, then it will
      allocate required bandwidth on the interface on which the RSVP
      PATH message is received, and send the RESV message to the node
      which sends the PATH message without propagating the PATH message
      further to the upstream node.  For P2MP LSPs, a label is carried
      by the PATH message and should be used by the upstream node when
      distributing the data from upstream to downstream.

   o  For MP2MP LSP tree structures, a node will allocate required
      bandwidth on the interface through which the RSVP PATH message is
      sent before sending the RSVP PATH message upstream.  A node
      receiving a RSVP PATH message MUST first decide if this RSVP PATH
      message will make the said node a branch LSR or not.  In the case
      it will become a transit LSR because of this PATH message, then it
      will allocate required bandwidth on the interface on which the
      RSVP PATH message is received and will allocate required bandwidth
      on the interface through which the RSVP PATH message is sent,
      before sending the RSVP PATH message upstream.  The downstream
      node can send traffic soon after successfully reserving bandwidth
      on the upstream link through which the RSVP PATH message SHOULD be
      sent.  The upstream node can send traffic soon after successfully
      reserving bandwidth on the downstream link on which the RSVP PATH
      message SHOULD be received.  In the case that the node is already
      a branch or a transit node before it receives the PATH message,
      then it will allocate required resources on the interface on which
      the RSVP PATH message is received, and send the RESV message to
      the node which sends the PATH message without propagating the PATH
      message further to the upstream node.  The label carried by the
      PATH message should be used by the Path-Receiver node to forward
      data from the Path-Receiver node to the Path-Sender node, and the
      label carried by RESV messages should be used by its corresponding
      Path-Sender node to send data from the Path-Sender node to the
      Path-Receiver node.

   o  For the sake of readability, from now on all mRSVP-TE LSPs will be
      used to represent all P2MP and/or MP2MP LSPs in receiver-driven
      (RD) multicast P2MP/MP2MP MPLS environments.  We will sometimes
      use RD P2MP TE LSP or RD MP2MP TE LSP to represent such receiver-
      driven multicast LSPs.

2.  Receiver-Driven mRSVP-TE LSP Examples

   In what follows we describe two examples to show how P2MP and MP2MP
   are set up, respectively.  In both of such examples, Path messages
   are initiated by data receivers.

   For the P2MP example, a Path message carries a label for the use of
   sending data downstream.  And for the MP2MP example, both Path
   message and Resv message carries a label for sending data downstream
   and upstream.

                          Figure 1: P2MP Example

   In Figure 1, when R5 is added as the first leaf of a mulitcast
   distribution tree (multicast LSP), the message flow goes as follows:
   R5->msg1->R3->msg2->R1->msg3->R3->msg4->R5.  When the leaf R4 is
   added, the message flow goes from R4->msg5->R3->msg6->R4.  In this
   case, when R3 receives msg5, R3 finds out that a multicast LSP has
   already been set up for the same session and the same source.
   Therefore, R3 finds itself a branch node for leaf R4 and R5, so it
   will terminate the PATH message and build the corresponding RESV
   message and send it back to R4.  The association of the LSP initiated
   by R4 to the existing multicast LSP is determined based on the
   processing of the SESSION object and L2S_SUB_LSP object from the
   mRSVP-TE message.  The SESSION object and the L2S_SUB_LSP objects are
   documented later in this draft.

   For MP2MP, the root address should be specified.  It is something
   similar to RP in PIM, but it doesn't need the Register message.  In
   one-to-many applications, the root should be the same as the Sender,
   while in many-to-many applications, the root could be any router, but
   should be selected in the same way as RP is selected in PIM.  In
   Figure 2, R1 is specified as the root.  When R5 is added as the first
   leaf (as both a sender and a receiver) of an MP2MP multicast LSP, the
   message flow goes from R5->msg1->R3->msg2->R1->msg3->R3->msg4->R5.
   When the leaf R4 ( as both a sender and a receiver)is added, the
   message flow goes from R4->msg5->R3->msg6->R4.  In this case, when R3
   receives msg5, R3 finds out that an MP2MP mulitcast LSP has already
   been set up for the same session and the same root and R3 will become
   the branch LSR for the leaf R4 and R5, so it will terminate the PATH
   message, build a RESV message and send the RESV message back to R4.
   The association of the LSP initiated by R4 to the existing MP2MP LSP
   is determined based on the processing of the SESSION object and the
   S2L_SUB_LSP from the mRSVP-TE message.  The SESSION objects and the
   L2S_SUB_LSP objects are further documented later in this draft.

3.  Signaling Protocol Extensions

   The RSVP-TE with receiver-driven extensions (mRSVP-TE) is similar to
   the RSVP-TE protocol as specified in [RFC4875], [RFC3473] and
   [RFC3209], but differs in that the data receivers of an LSP tunnel
   initiate the Path messages toward the data sender (or the root of a
   mulitcast LSP).  Compared with [RFC4875], mRSVP-TE can also be used
   to set up MP2MP LSPs.

   In the context of the receiver-driven RSVP-TE, the Receiver is the
   Path-Originator.  The Path messages go from the Receivers towards the
   Sender.  The Resv messages flow in the opposite direction as compared
   to the Path messages, i.e. Resv messages are generated by the Sender
   or a branch LSR.  Path messages flow in opposite directions as
   cmpared with those of the multicast stream distributions, while Resv
   messages flow in the same directions as the multicast streams.

   In the context of the receiver-driven RSVP-TE, a Path message will be
   terminated at the "root" of the multicast distribution tree

   (multicast LSP) or at an intermediate node if the intermediate node
   has received another Path message from another receiver for the same
   multicast distribution tree.  When an intermediate node receives two
   or more Path messages for the same multicast distribution tree, the
   intermediate node will merge them together.  Whether two Path
   messages should be merged depends on the information encoded in the
   SESSION and L2S-SUB-LSP objects.  The SESSION object encodes
   multicast group information and the L2S-SUB-LSP (leaf-to-source sub-
   lsp) object encodes the multicast source or multicast root
   information.

   The following sections describe the receiver-driven extensions to the
   RSVP-TE protocol.  When there is no difference in the protocol, the
   usage of [RFC4875] is assumed.

3.1.  Mechanisms

3.1.1.  Sessions

   As specified in [RFC2205], a session is a data flow with a particular
   destination and transport-layer protocol.  In the context of
   multicast, the data flow is essentially a multicast distribution tree
   rooted at the P2MP source or MP2MP root.

   For the sake of reliability, two or more sources/roots may be
   deployed to distribute the same multicast streams.  A mulitcast
   stream is often represented by a mulitcast group address.  In this
   document, we will encode the mulitcast group address in the SESSION
   object and the mulitcast source/root address in the leaf-to-source
   sub-LSP object.  Note that the same session can have different
   sources/roots, and the same sources/roots can have different
   sessions.

   In the context of the receiver-driven mRSVP-TE, the processing of
   SESSION objects is different from that of SESSION objects in sender-
   driven RSVP-TE [RFC4875].  In order to distinguish them, we will
   employ different C-Types of SESSIONs.  In this document we will
   document SESSION objects for native IPv4/IPv6 multicast applications.
   For new and more applications, new types of SESSION objects will be
   added.

   Following the method used by RSVP-TE and P2MP RSVP-TE, this draft
   documents the use of some new SESSION C-Type as follows:


     Class Name = SESSION
      C-Type
        XX+0   mRSVP_TE_P2MP_LSP_TUNNEL_IPv4 C-Type

Internet-Draft      Receiver-Driven Multicast RSVP-TE          July 2013


        XX+1   mRSVP_TE_P2MP_LSP_TUNNEL_IPv6 C-Type
        XX+2   mRSVP_TE_MP2MP_LSP_TUNNEL_IPv4 C-Type
        XX+3   mRSVP_TE_MP2MP_LSP_TUNNEL_IPv6 C-Type

      Where XX is a number to be allocated by IANA.


                     Figure 3: New C-Types of SESSIONs

   The new SESSION C-Type MUST be used in all receiver-driven P2MP RSVP-
   TE messages.

3.1.2.  L2S Sub-LSPs

   A multicast LSP is composed of one or more leaf-to-source sub-LSPs,
   which are merged together at the branch nodes.  There are two ways to
   identify each such sub-LSP:

   o  From the Sender's perspective, each sub-LSP is identified by the
      SESSION object, the SENDER_TEMPLATE object and S2L_SUB_LSP object,
      as specified in [RFC 4875].  The SESSION object encodes P2MP ID,
      Tunnel ID, and Extended Tunnel ID.  The P2MP ID is unique within
      the scope of the sender (ingress LSR) and remains constant
      throughout the lifetime of the P2MP tree structure.  The Extended
      Tunnel ID, which remains constant throughout the lifetime of the
      P2MP tree structure, and which should contain the sender's address
      to make sure the identifier is globally unique.  Finally, the
      Tunnel ID, also remains constant throughout the lifetime of the
      P2MP tree structure.  The SENDER_TEMPLATE object contains the
      ingress LSR source address.  The S2L_SUB_LSP contains the
      destination address of the sub-LSP.

   o  From the Receiver's perspective, each sub-LSP is identified by a
      new SESSION object, a new SENDER_TEMPLATE object and a new
      L2S_SUB_LSP object.  The SESSION object, different from the one
      used in typical sender-driven environments, contains information
      to be used as the key to associate different PATH messages
      originated from different leaves.  The SENDER_TEMPLATE object
      contains the Path-Originator's address, which is actually the Data
      Receiver.  For P2MP LSP, the L2S_SUB_LSP contains the source
      address of the sub-LSP, i.e. the data Sender's address.  For MP2MP
      LSP, the L2S_SUB_LSP contains the root address of the sub-LSP.
      The root address could be any router.  The SESSION,
      SENDER_TEMPLATE and L2S_SUB_LSP all together will identify the
      multicast stream, the multicast stream's source, and a mulitcast
      stream's receiver

   This document takes the approach from the Receiver's perspective.
   The approach from the Sender's perspective is documented in [RFC
   4875].

   Once an LSR receives a receiver-driven Path message with the SESSION
   object and L2S_SUB_LSP object, the LSR should be able to use the
   SESSION object and L2S_SUB_LSP object to determine whether the sub-
   LSP signaled by this Path message should be merged with existing
   multicast LSPs.

3.1.3.  Path Originator and Data Receiver

   In the context of the receiver-driven RSVP-TE, a Path Originator is
   also a Data Receiver.  This document will document a new type of
   SENDER_TEMPLATE object, which contains the Path-Originator's IP
   address and describes the identity of the Path Originator.

   In [RFC 2205] and [RFC 4875], the "sender" is both a path originator
   and a data sender.  In the receiver-driven context, path originators
   and data senders may be different.  For P2MP, path originators are
   actually the data receivers.  For MP2MP, path originators are also
   both the data senders and data receivers.

   In this document, we will use the same Object Class SENDER_TEMPLATE
   with a different C-Type to represent and identify Path Originator.
   In the case of P2MP LSP, the SENDER_TEMPLATE describes the identify
   of a data receiver.  In the case of MP2MP, the SENDER_TEMPLATE
   describes the identify of an LSR which work as both a data sender and
   a data receiver.

   All of the SESSION object, L2S_SUB_LSP object and SENDER_TEMPLATE
   object together contained in a Path message will uniquely identify a
   leaf-to-source sub-LSP.

3.1.4.  Explicit Routing

   An EXPLICIT_ROUTE Object (ERO) is used to optionally specify the
   explicit route of an L2S sub-LSP.  Each signaled ERO corresponds to a
   particular L2S_SUB_LSP object.  Details of explicit route encoding
   are specified in section 4.5 of [RFC4875], but they are encoded in a
   reverse order in the receiver-driven context.

   When a Path message signals a L2S sub-LSP, the EXPLICIT_ROUTE object
   encodes the path from the leaf to the root LSR.  The Path message
   also includes the L2S_SUB_LSP object for the L2S sub-LSP being
   signaled.  The < [<EXPLICIT_ROUTE>], <L2S_SUB_LSP>> tuple represents
   the L2S sub-LSP and is referred to as the sub-LSP descriptor.

Internet-Draft      Receiver-Driven Multicast RSVP-TE          July 2013


   The absence of the ERO should be interpreted as requiring hop-by-hop
   reverse-forwarding for the sub-LSP based on the root address field of
   the L2S_SUB_LSP object.

3.2.  Path Messages

   The mechanism specified in this document allows a multicast P2MP/
   MP2MP LSP to be signaled using one or more Path messages.  Each Path
   message may signal one L2S sub-LSPs.

   A receiver-driven P2MP MPLS-TE LSP uses the Path message to carry the
   LABEL object upstream from the Receiver towards the Sender.  With a
   receiver-driven usage of the RSVP PATH messages, the LABEL_REQUEST
   object carried by the PATH message is no longer mandatory, it becomes
   optional for receiver-driven PATH messages, as specified in Figure 4:


          <Path Message> ::=     <Common Header> [ <INTEGRITY> ]
                              [ [<MESSAGE_ID_ACK> | <MESSAGE_ID_NACK>] ...]
                              [ <MESSAGE_ID> ]
                              <SESSION> <RSVP_HOP>
                              <TIME_VALUES>
                              [ <EXPLICIT_ROUTE> ]
                              [ <LABEL_REQUEST> ]
                              [ <PROTECTION> ]
                              [ <LABEL_SET> ... ]
                              [ <SESSION_ATTRIBUTE> ]
                              [ <NOTIFY_REQUEST> ]
                              [ <ADMIN_STATUS> ]
                              [ <POLICY_DATA> ... ]
                              <sender descriptor>
                              [<L2S_SUB_LSP>]


                     Figure 4: Path Message Extensions

   The SESSION object encodes information about the being-signalled
   multicast stream.  The SESSION object together with L2S_SUB_LSP will
   be used as the key to associate different sub-LSPs to the same
   multicast LSP.

   Using [RFC4875] as the base specification, the LABEL object is added
   to the <sender descriptor> as specified in Figure 5:




            <sender descriptor> ::=  <SENDER_TEMPLATE> <SENDER_TSPEC>

                                     [ <ADSPEC> ]
                                     [ <RECORD_ROUTE> ]
                                     [ <SUGGESTED_LABEL> ]
                                     [ <RECOVERY_LABEL> ]

                        Figure 5: Sender Descriptor

   The LABEL object is defined in section 4.1 of [RFC3209]

   Note that the receiver-driven Path messages convey the LABEL_REQUEST
   as an optional object.  If the Path message signals a P2MP LSP, the
   LABEL_REQUEST in the Path message is not used.  If the Path message
   signals an MP2MP, the LABEL_REQUEST is needed to ask for labels from
   its upstream LSR.

3.3.  Resv Messages

   Receiver-driven P2MP RSVP-TE does not need any change to the basic
   RESV messages specified in section 6.1 of [RFC4875], as long as the
   receiver-driven SESSION objects of the new C-Types are used.

   For receiver-driven P2MP LSPs, the Path message carries the LABEL
   object, and thus the Resv message doesn't have to carry the LABEL
   object anymore.  But for MP2MP LSPs, both Path and Resv messages will
   carry LABEL objects for sending and receiving purposes, respectively.
   Within the context of MP2MP LSPs, one of the directions is
   established as per [RFC3209].  Thus, this document is changing the
   use of the LABEL object in the FF Flow Descriptor and SE Filter Spec
   from mandatory to optional, as specified in Figure 6:



      <FF flow descriptor> ::= [ <FLOWSPEC> ] <FILTER_SPEC> [ <LABEL> ]
                               [ <RECORD_ROUTE> ]
                               [ <L2S_SUB_LSP> ]

      <SE filter spec> ::=     <FILTER_SPEC> [ <LABEL> ] [ <RECORD_ROUTE> ]
                               [ <L2S_SUB_LSP> ]

   The receiver-driven PathErr messages have the same syntax and
   utilization as the PathErr message described in [RFC4875], with the
   difference in the <sender descriptor> carried by the PathErr message.
   The receiver-driven PathErr message will use the <sender descriptor>
   defined in this document, the same as that carried by the Path
   messages which the PathErr messages correspond to.

3.5.  ResvErr Message

   The receiver-driven ResvErr messages have the same syntax and
   utilization as the ResvErr message described in [RFC4875].  But the
   ResvErr messages will be processed as per this document, given that
   the <FF flow descriptor> and the <SE filter spec> can optionally
   contain the LABEL object instead of mandating the use of the LABEL
   object.  The optional use of the LABEL object is conditioned by the
   nature of the multicast LSP, either uni-directional (P2MP) or bi-
   directional (MP2MP).

3.6.  PathTear Messages

   The receiver-driven PathTear messages have the same syntax and
   utilization as the PathTear messages described in [RFC4875] except
   for the <sender descriptor> carried by the PathTear messages.  The
   receiver-driven PathTear messages will use <sender descriptor>
   defined in this document, the same as that carried by the Path
   messages which the PathTear messages correspond to.

4.  New and Updated Objects

4.1.  SESSION Objects

   An mRSVP-TE LSP SESSION object is used to represent a multicast
   stream whose traffic will be carried by the multicast LSP being set
   up by the mRSVP-TE.  The object still uses the existing SESSION C-Num
   assigned for RSVP-TE, but new C-Types are defined for the new
   purposes.  Different from the values in the existing point-to-point
   or point-to-multipoint RSVP-TE SESSION object, the new objects
   defined by the new C-Types will encode "multicasting" information.
   The new SESSION object will have enough information so that the Path-
   Receivers can use the SESSION objects together with L2S_SUB_LSP to
   determine whether or not to associate different Path messages from
   different leaves to the same P2MP/MP2MP LSP.  The combination of the
   SESSION object, the SENDER_TEMPLATE object and the L2S_SUB_LSP object
   will uniquely identify a single L2S sub-LSP.

   For native IPv4/IPv6 multicast, IPv4/IPv6 (S, G) or (*, G, RP) will
   be encoded in the SESSION object for P2MP or MP2MP LSPs.  In what
   follows we specify such session objects for IPv4/IPv6 P2MP and MP2MP

   The SENDER_TEMPLATE object contains the Path-Initiator LSR address.
   In this document, the Path-Initiator is the same as the Leaf Router
   or Data Receiver.  The LSP ID can be changed to allow a sender to do
   a certain level of resource sharing.  Thus, multiple instances of the
   same mutlicast LSP can be created, each with a different LSP ID.  The
   instances can share resources with each other.  The L2S sub-LSPs
   corresponding to a particular instance use the same LSP ID.

Internet-Draft      Receiver-Driven Multicast RSVP-TE          July 2013


5.  Applications

   There are two basic applications for receiver-driven RSVP-TE: inter-
   work with PIM and Multicast VPN.

5.1.  Interwork with PIM

   Some multicast applications may involve several domains, some of
   which are operated with PIM while others are enabled with RSVP-TE.
   This requires the multicast distribution trees to be computed and set
   up across different domains with PIM and MPLS configured in different
   domains.  When a PIM Join message is received at the border of the
   MPLS domain, information encoded from the PIM Join message can be
   encoded as a receiver-driven RSVP-TE Path message which will set up a
   multicast distribution LSP across the MPLS domain.  The root of such
   a multicast LSP can encode a PIM Join message by using the
   information encoded in the RSVP-TE Path message.  The result of doing
   so will enable to build a mulitcast distribution tree across both IP
   and MPLS domains.  The multicast tree will consist of a set of IP
   multicast sub-trees built by PIM and a set of MPLS multicast LSPs
   built by the receiver-driven RSVP-TE.

5.2.  Multicast VPN

   An L3VPN service that supports multicast is known as a Multicast VPN,
   or MVPN for short.  An MVPN needs to connect multiple customer sites
   where some hosts may be senders, may be receivers and may be both
   senders and receivers.  [RFC 6513] specifies protocols and procedures
   for Multicast in BGP/MPLS IP VPN, and [RFC 6514] describes the BGP
   encodings and procedures for exchanging the information elements
   required by Multicast in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs as specified in RFC 6513.

   Consider an MVPN with two or more senders.  If P2MP RSVP-TE is used
   to build the multicast distribution tree for multicast in MPLS/BGP IP
   VPNs, we will need two or more P2MP LSPs, each such P2MP LSP for each
   sender, which will increase the forwarding states in core routers.
   The more senders, the more P2MP LSPs, and the more forwarding states.
   Instead, we can use the extension and the procedure described in this
   document to set up a single MP2MP LSP no matter how many senders
   there are.  The use of MP2MP will greatly reduce the number of P2MP
   LSPs and the forwarding states for multicast in BGP/MPLS IP VPNs.

6.  Fast Re-Route Considerations

   The Fast Re-Route mechanisms and procedures specified in [RFC 4090]
   will not be applicable to the receiver-driven extension to RSVP-TE
   described in this document, since their Path/Resv messages are sent
   in different directions.

   Extensions to mRSVP-TE to support Fast Re-Route are described in the
   document [I-D.zlj-mpls-mpls-mrsvp-te-frr].

7.  Backward Compatibility

   A receiver-driven P2MP LSP mechanism uses different C-Types than
   those in the sender-driven P2MP RSVP-TE.  If LSRs do not recognize
   the receiver-driven C-Types, they will not support the receiver-
   driven extensions described in this document.  LSRs that do not
   support receiver-driven P2MP-TE LSP, send Path Error [TBD] back to
   the Path Originator.

   The complete discussion on the backward compatibility will be
   provided in the Next version of the document.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This section is TBD.

10.  Security Considerations

   How a receiver is authenticated is outside the scope of this
   document.  But we will briefly summarize the requirements which are
   detailed in the requirements draft.

   It is a requirement that any mRSVP-TE solution developed to meet some
   or all of the requirements expressed in this document MUST include
   mechanisms to enable the secure establishment and management of
   mRSVP-TE MPLS-TE LSPs.  This includes, but is not limited to:

   o  A receiver MUST be authenticated before it is allowed to establish
      mRSVP-TE LSP with its source, in addition to hop-by-hop security
      issues identified by in RFC 3209 and RFC 4206.

   o  mechanisms to ensure that the ingress LSR of a P2MP LSP is
      identified;

   o  mechanisms to ensure that communicating signaling entities can
      verify each other's identities;

   o  mechanisms to ensure that control plane messages are protected
      against spoofing and tampering;

   o  mechanisms to ensure that unauthorized leaves or branches are not
      added to the mRSVP-TE LSP; and

   o  mechanisms to protect signaling messages from snooping.

   o  Note that mRSVP-TE signaling mechanisms built on P2P RSVP-TE
      signaling are likely to inherit all the security techniques and
      problems associated with RSVP-TE.  These problems may be
      exacerbated in mRSVP-TE situations where security relationships
      may need to maintained between an ingress LSR and multiple egress
      LSRs.  Such issues are similar to security issues for IP
      multicast.

   o  It is a requirement that documents offering solutions for P2MP
      LSPs MUST have detailed security sections.
