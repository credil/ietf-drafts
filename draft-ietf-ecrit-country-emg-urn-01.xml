					The 'sos' service type describes emergency services requiring an
					immediate response, typically offered by various branches of the
					government or other public institutions.  Additional sub-services can
					be added after expert review and must be of general public interest
					and have a similar emergency nature.  The expert is designated by the
					ECRIT working group, its successor, or, in their absence, the IESG.
					The expert review should only approve emergency services that are
					offered widely and in different countries, with approximately the
					same caller expectation in terms of services rendered.  The 'sos'
					service is not meant to invoke general government, public
					information, counseling, or social services.
				</c>
			</texttable>
			<t>
				Some existing emergency services are, at least initially, offered in one 
				country only. Examples are the "Reporting spies" emergency service offered 
				in South Korea and the "GAULA (anti-kidnapping)" emergency service offered 
				in Colombia according to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_telephone_number.
				Future emergency service might also initially be introduced in one country only.

			<t>
				The policy for registration of sub-services of the service URN with the 'sos' service 
				type, as defined in RFC 5031 <xref target="RFC5031" pageno="false" format="default"/>,
				prevents the registration of a sub-service of the service URN with the 'sos' service 
				type for a service that, at the time of registration, is offered in one country only.
			</t>
			<t>
				This document updates section 4.2 of RFC 5031, in order to allow the registration of 
				service URNs with the 'sos' service type for emergency services that, at the time of 
				registration, are offered in one country only.

urn:service:sos  The generic 'sos' service reaches a public safety
   answering point (PSAP), which in turn dispatches aid appropriate
   to the emergency.  It encompasses all of the services listed
   below.

urn:service:sos.ambulance  This service identifier reaches an
   ambulance service that provides emergency medical assistance and
   transportation.

urn:service:sos.animal-control  Animal control typically enforces
   laws and ordinances pertaining to animal control and management,
   investigates cases of animal abuse, educates the community in
   responsible pet ownership and wildlife care, and provides for the
   housing and care of homeless animals, among other animal-related
   services.

urn:service:sos.fire  The 'fire' service identifier summons the fire
   service, also known as the fire brigade or fire department.

urn:service:sos.gas  The 'gas' service allows the reporting of
   natural gas (and other flammable gas) leaks or other natural gas
   emergencies.

urn:service:sos.marine  The 'marine' service refers to maritime
   search and rescue services such as those offered by the coast
   guard, lifeboat, or surf lifesavers.

urn:service:sos.mountain  The 'mountain' service refers to mountain
   rescue services (i.e., search and rescue activities that occur in
   a mountainous environment), although the term is sometimes also
   used to apply to search and rescue in other wilderness
   environments.

urn:service:sos.physician  The 'physician' emergency service connects
   the caller to a physician referral service.

urn:service:sos.poison  The 'poison' service refers to special
   information centers set up to inform citizens about how to respond
   to potential poisoning.  These poison control centers maintain a
   database of poisons and appropriate emergency treatment.

urn:service:sos.police  The 'police' service refers to the police
   department or other law enforcement authorities.
