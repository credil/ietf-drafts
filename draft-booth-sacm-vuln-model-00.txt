       Software Vulnerability Data Model and Data Exchange Format
                     draft-booth-sacm-vuln-model-00

Abstract

   This Internet-Draft describes the Vulnerability Data Model (VDM)
   version 1.0, a vendor neutral data model for expressing data and
   metadata for individual vulnerabilities, and an XML format that can
   be used to exchange vulnerability data model information.  VDM
   provides standard fields, formats and vocabularies that can be used
   to transmit information about software vulnerabilities between
   entities in an interoperable manner.  VDM is suited for a wide
   variety of use cases, and provides extension points to facilitate
   additional use cases.

Internet-Draft          Vulnerability Data Model            October 2012


1.  Introduction

   A vulnerability may be defined as an error, flaw, or mistake in
   computer software that permits or causes an unintended behavior to
   occur.  As an example, the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE)
   dictionary provides a list of known vulnerabilities.  Since the
   unintended behavior of a vulnerability often has computer security
   implications, exchanging vulnerability information to understand the
   impact of a vulnerability to an enterprise, and to prioritize
   remediation is often desirable.

   Sharing vulnerability information among individuals, products, and
   organizations has been challenging because of a lack of standardized
   vulnerability data fields, vocabularies, and formats.  The National
   Vulnerability Database (NVD) has been producing vulnerability
   information for over ten years and this document documents and
   improves upon the data feeds currently provided by the NVD to
   establish the Vulnerability Data Model (VDM); a common basis upon
   which to share vulnerability information.  The Vulnerability Data
   Model facilitates communication of vulnerability information by
   enumerating common data fields and vocabularies useful for describing
   individual vulnerabilities.

   The vulnerability data model and associated exchange format are
   intended for use by universal vulnerability data feeds, such as those
   that would be produced by a vulnerability database or security
   service provider for consuming organizations.  Additionally, the
   vulnerability date model exchange format incorporates extension
   points to allow producer specific data to be incorporated into a data
   feed which may be optionally processed by a consuming organization
   that understands the producer specific data.

1.1.  Purpose and Scope

   This report defines the Vulnerability Data Model and XML data
   exchange format.  The report gives an introduction to VDM version
   1.0, defines the vulnerability data model, and documents conformance
   requirements to comply with VDM 1.0.  The vulnerability data model
   has been divided into four component models: vulnerability core, CVSS
   version 2, metadata core, and SCAP core models.  Other versions of
   VDM are not addressed here.  Future versions of VDM will be defined
   in distinct revisions of this report, each clearly labeled with a
   revision number and the appropriate VDM version number.

   This report does not describe the queries, instructions, methods,
   processes, or data required to produce a VDM document.  This report
   does not describe how to transform any specific data model or data
   set into a VDM document.  This report provides normative guidance

   relating to the production and consumption of the XML vulnerability
   data model format.  The appendices contain additional information
   about how to use VDM.

1.2.  Audience

   This document is intended for individuals or organizations intending
   to make use of the vulnerability data model to either produce or
   consume vulnerability information.  Possible uses of the
   vulnerability data model may be as part of a product or service
   delivery effort such as a vulnerability database or vulnerability
   scanning tool, by vendors wishing to supply vulnerability information
   to end users in a human readable format,, and by researchers
   analyzing vulnerability information.  Readers of this report should
   already be familiar with basic vulnerability characteristics and
   concepts.

1.3.  Document Structure

   The remainder of this document is organized into the following major
   sections:

   o  Section 2 defines the document's conventions.

   o  Section 3 defines the terms used within this specification and
      provides a list of common abbreviations.

   o  Section 4 describes how this specification relates to other
      standards and specifications.

   o  Section 5 defines the conformance requirements for VDM.

   o  Section 6 provides an overview of the VDM data model constructs
      and key concepts.

   o  Section 7 documents the VDM data model.

   o  Section 8 lists existing controlled vocabulary items.

   o  Section 9 provides acknowledgments for the document.

   o  Section 10 discusses IANA considerations.

   o  Section 11 discusses security considerations.

   o  Section 12 provides a list of normative references for the
      document.

   o  Appendix A describes use cases for VDM.

   o  Appendix B provides some VDM examples.


2.  Document Conventions

   Throughout this specification, when referencing a normative
   reference, the name will be written between brackets, such as [XSD].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   XML elements [XML] are referred to using qualified names when they
   are not in the VDM namespace.  Elements with no prefix can be assumed
   to be in the VDM namespace, unless otherwise noted.  A qualified name
   associates a named element with a namespace.  The namespace
   identifies the specific XML schema that defines (and consequently may
   be used to validate) the syntax of the element instance.  A qualified
   name declares this schema to element association using the format
   'prefix:element-name'.  The association of prefix to namespace is
   defined in the metadata of an XML document and varies from document
   to document.  In this specification, the conventional mappings listed
   in Table 1 are used.

4.  Relationship to Existing Standards and Specifications

   VDM's relationships to other selected specifications are described
   below.

   CPE - VDM leverages CPE to identify affected platforms and products.
   Information about the CPE specification can be found at:
   http://scap.nist.gov/specifications/cpe/.


5.  Conformance

   Developers and organizations may want to build products in
   conformance with VDM to foster consistency and interoperability of
   their own products.  End-user organizations may wish to require
   conformance with VDM in order to have a predictable defined format
   that products and tools used within their environment will produce
   and consume.  In addition, products that conform to this
   specification will be better able to interoperate and exchange
   reporting information with other products that conform to VDM.

   Products may want to claim conformance with this specification to
   advertise their interoperability with other VDM compliant tools and
   repositories, as well as to meet requirements set by other
   specifications or organizations.

   The following sections define the criteria for content and products
   to claim conformance with this specification.

5.1.  Capability Conformance

   There are two types of VDM capabilities: producers and consumers.  A
   producer has the capability to generate VDM documents, while a
   consumer has the capability to accept an existing VDM document and
   process it.  To claim conformance to one or more capabilities defined
   within this specification the following requirements SHALL be adhered
   to:

   1.  For producer capability, generate well-formed content as defined
       in Section 5.2.

   2.  For consumer capability, accept and process well-formed content
       as defined in Section 5.2.

   3.  Make an explicit claim of conformance to this specification in
       any documentation provided to end users.

5.2.  Content Conformance

   In order for a VDM document to be considered in compliance with this
   specification, the report MUST adhere to the following requirements:

   1.  The VDM document SHALL conform to all of the normative guidance
       provided in Section 7.


6.  Vulnerability Data Model Overview and Key Concepts

   This section provides an overview of the vulnerability data model
   structure and design philosophy.  The data model defines a format for
   representing one or more collections of data.  The following sections
   introduce the key concepts of the vulnerability data model.

   The vulnerability data model was designed in a modular fashion, with
   multiple schemas developed to encourage composability and
   reusability.  Items with similar properties and uses are grouped into
   the same namespace.

   o  Metadata Core: The metadata core schema provides elements that
      store information about the record itself, as well as common types
      that are used in other schemas.  The metadata includes entities
      for status history, text types, references, and document
      generators.

   o  SCAP Core: The SCAP core schema provides types that represent
      entities from additional SCAP specifications and schemas.

   o  CVSS v2: The CVSS v2 schema represents CVSS version 2 scores.  The
      information includes CVSS base metrics, environmental metrics and

      temporal metrics.

   o  Vulnerability Data Model: The vulnerability data model provides a
      representation of the vulnerability information.


7.  Data Model Description

   This section describes the requirements for the vulnerability data
   model manifested as Extensible Markup Language (XML).  Section 7.1
   provides a conceptual overview of the data model, while Section 7.2
   examines the actual XML data model in detail.

7.1.  XML Data Model Introduction

   The vulnerability element is the root element of the Vulnerability
   Data Model; it is of the vulnerabilityType type.  It contains
   identification, metadata, and additional information about an
   individual Vulnerability in a vulnerability document.

7.2.  XML Data Model Requirements

   In order to comply with the VDM data model,

   o  The user MUST produce an XML vdm:vulnerability element consistent
      with the data model described below.

   o  The XML element produced MUST validate against the XSD for
      Vulnerability Data Model 1.0 listed at
      http://scap.nist.gov/specifications/ .  In situations where the
      XSD does not match the documented model in this specification,
      this document SHALL take precedence.

   The following tables formalize the data model.  The data contained in
   the tables are requirements and MUST be interpreted as follows:

   o  The "Element Name" field indicates the name for the XML element
      being described.  Each element name has a namespace prefix
      indicating the namespace to which the element belongs.  See
      Table 1 for a mapping of namespace prefixes to namespaces.

   o  The "Definition" field indicates the prose description of the
      element.  The definition field MAY contain requirement words as
      indicated in [RFC2119].

   o  The "Properties" field is broken into four subfields:

Internet-Draft          Vulnerability Data Model            October 2012


      *  The "Name" column indicates the name of a property that MAY or
         MUST be included in the described element, in accordance with
         the cardinality indicated in the "Count" field

      *  The "Type" column indicates the REQUIRED data type for the
         value of the property.  There are three categories of types:
         literal, element, and special.  A literal type will indicate
         the type of literal as defined in [XSD].  An element type will
         reference the name of another element that defines that
         property.  A special type is listed when the type is neither
         literal nor element.  The special type will indicate the nature
         of permitted content, such as allowing any XML to be used.

      *  The "Count" column indicates the cardinality of the property
         within the element.  The property MUST be included in the
         element in accordance with the cardinality.  If a range is
         given, and "n" is the upper-bound of the range, then the upper
         limit is unbounded.

      *  The "Definition" column defines the property in the context of
         the element.  The definition MAY contain requirement words as
         indicated in [RFC2119].

7.2.1.  Metadata Core

   The metadata core schema contains common data types and elements
   intended to record information about record entities themselves
   instead of the items represented by the record.

7.2.1.1.  dottedVersionType

   The dotted version type defines a format used to represent
   incremental changes to an items content.  It consists of up to 4
   integer values, separated by the '.' character.  General usage is to
   increment a part based on the extent of the change, with the
   rightmost part indicating insignificant changes, and the leftmost
   part indicating major changes.

   When comparing dottedVersionType values the following logic SHALL be
   used: Assuming you have 2 dottedVersionType values A and B, each
   value is to be split into its 4 components on the ' .' character.  If
   a value does not have all 4 components, the missing components will
   be considered to have a value of 0 for comparison purposes.  Once all
   components have been extracted, A1 will be compared to B1.  If A1 is
   greater than B1 then A is greater than B. If A1 is less than B1 then
   A is less than B. If A1 is equal to B1 then A2 is compared to B2
   using the same logic, then A3 and B3 and finally A4 and B4.  If all 4
   parts of A are equal to all 4 corresponding parts of B then A is

   | Description | Available enumeration values: NEW - A newly created |
   |             | record that has not undergone moderation. DRAFT - A |
   |             | record that has been reviewed by one or more        |
   |             | moderators, but that has not completed the review   |
   |             | process. FINAL - A record that has completed the    |
   |             | moderation process. It is recommended that records  |
   |             | with this status are the only records included in   |
   |             | the data dictionary. REVISED - Indicates that a     |
   |             | record that was once in the FINAL state has been    |

   |             | the FINAL state, but has been removed from the data |
   |             | dictionary. This is typical if the record is no     |
   |             | longer in general use. REJECTED - This state        |
   |             | indicates that record was rejected during the       |
   |             | moderation process. Records with this state will    |
   |             | never be posted to the data dictionary and should   |
   |             | not be used.                                        |

7.2.1.12.  generatorType

   The generatorType defines an element that can be used to store
   information about the compilation of a specific instance of output
   containing vulnerability information. generatorType is an element
   that is used to hold information about when a particular document was
   compiled, what version of the schema was used, what tool compiled the
   document and what version of that tool was used.  Additional
   generator information is also allowed although it is not part of the
   official schema.  Individual organizations can place generator
   information that they feel are important and these will be skipped
   during the validation.  All that this schema really cares about is
   that the stated generator information is there.

   The checkReferenceType defines a method to represent a checking
   system and check id to identify a method of detecting the presence of
   the vulnerability on an asset.  It is a data type for the check
   element, a checking system specification specific URI, string
   content, and an optional external file reference.  The checking
   system specification should be the URI for a particular version of
   OVAL or a related system testing language, and the content will be an
   identifier of a test written in that language.  The external file
   reference could be used to point to the file in which the content
   test identifier is defined.  The checkReferenceType extends the
   checkSearchType.

8.  Controlled Vocabularies

   Several types in the Vulnerability Data Model utilize controlled
   vocabularies in an attempt to provide a balance between usability and
   flexibility.  Controlled vocabularies utilize a standard format for
   values of the form scap:authority:id, while allowing other entities
   to create additional entries.  The following elements utilize the
   vocabularies defined below.

8.1.  event-type

   The event-type controlled vocabulary is used to identify the type of
   the event that occurred.

11.  Security Considerations

   As a data format, the Vulnerability Data Model does not have security
   concerns that are known at this time.  However, as a data format
   designed to be stored and transmitted between entities within an
   enterprise, the fact of the matter is that it SHOULD be used within a
   properly secured environment.  Over time, a significant amount of

   information valuable to attackers can be gleaned from Vulnerability
   Data Model information.  Therefore, it is recommended that use of
   Vulnerability Data Models be performed in environments providing
   communication security mechanisms supplying the properties of
   confidentiality, data integrity, and non-repudiation.

Appendix A.  Use Cases

   This appendix documents some common use cases that were considered
   when developing VDM.

Internet-Draft          Vulnerability Data Model            October 2012


A.1.  OEM Vendor Statements

   It is common for OEM vendors to release information regarding
   vulnerabilities found in their products.  These releases often take
   the form of textual information about the vulnerability, in vendor
   specific formats.  Providing the information in a standardized format
   would allow those wishing to automatically gather and parse the
   vulnerability information to do so without developing custom tools
   for each vendor.

A.2.  Security Researchers

   Security researchers have interest in correlating and analyzing the
   data provided as part of the VDM for various purposes.  In order to
   support this use case the VDM should include the following
   information:

   o  A unique identifier for the vulnerability

   o  A list of additional identifiers for the vulnerability if
      applicable

   o  A list of the affected software and/or platforms

   o  An indication of the severity of the vulnerability, including any
      differences in severity based on various configurations

   o  References to support additional research

A.3.  System Design and Planning

   System Administrators, System Architects, and the authors of security
   guides all have an interest in knowing what vulnerabilities exist on
   a given platform.  The information provided by the vulnerability
   model can assist in determining:

   o  Which platforms to deploy

   o  What configurations of a platform to deploy

   o  What mitigating controls may be needed in a given environment

   o  What remediations are available for a vulnerability

   In order to support this use case vulnerability information should
   include:

Internet-Draft          Vulnerability Data Model            October 2012


   o  A unique identifier for a vulnerability

   o  An indication of when a vulnerability is applicable

   o  An indication of the severity of a vulnerability

   o  References to allow additional information about a vulnerability
      to be gathered

   o  References to existing remediations for the vulnerability

   o  Indicators of the freshness of the vulnerability information

A.4.  Assessment Content Authoring

   Some individuals or organizations have a need to create content to
   detect the presence of vulnerability.  Vulnerability detection may be
   done through the use of a common specification such as SCAP or
   through proprietary methods.  Information provided by the
   vulnerability model can assist in determining:

   o  Which platforms are affected by a vulnerability

   o  Where existing detection content may already exist

   o  The severity of the vulnerability

   In order to support the Assessment Content Authoring use case the
   vulnerability model should include:

   o  A unique identifier for the vulnerability

   o  An indication of what platforms are affected by the vulnerability

   o  An indication of the severity of the vulnerability

   o  Additional references to assist in researching the vulnerability

   o  References to any existing assessment content

   o  Indicators of the freshness of the vulnerability information

A.5.  Certification and Accreditation

   Certification and Accreditation teams are responsible for determining
   whether or not systems are allowed to remain on a given network.
   This is usually determined based on the priority of the function the
   system supports, assessment reports for the system, and

   organizational guidelines.  Information provided as part of the
   vulnerability model can assist in determining:

   o  The severity of a vulnerability

   o  The existence of exploits

   o  The existence of remediations

   o  The type of the vulnerability

   o  Indicators of the freshness of the vulnerability information

    driver and is the kernel part of the Windows subsystem. It
    contains the window manager, which controls window displays;
    manages screen output; collects input from the keyboard,
    mouse, and other devices; and passes user messages to
    applications. It also contains the Graphics Device Interface (GDI),
    which is a library of functions for graphics output devices.
    Finally,  it serves as a wrapper for DirectX support that is
    implemented in another driver (dxgkrnl.sys).  The Windows
    kernel is the core of the operating system. It provides
    system-level services such as device management and memory
