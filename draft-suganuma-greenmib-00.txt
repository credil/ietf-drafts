Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB),
   the GreenUsage MIB, for use with network management protocols
   in the Internet community.  In particular, the GreenUsage MIB
   can be used to monitor the power-on/power-off status of electrical
   devices.

1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


2.  Overview

2.1.  The GreenUsage monitoring concept
   Monitor the power-on/power-off status of electrical devices.  If a
   device is in power-on state beyond business hours, it is wasteful
   usage of electricity. The GreenUsage concept aims to monitor and
   reduce this wastage.
   This document defines a set of managed objects (MOs) that can be used
   to monitor the power-on/power-off status of electrical devices.

2.2.  Terminology
   Electrical device: a device that consumes electricity.  Power-
   on/power-off status indicates whether the device is powered on or
   not. Often it is not possible to get a direct indication of whether a
   device is powered on or not. But indirect means may be used to infer
   the power-on/power-off status of a device. For example, if a device
   shows some network activity, it can be inferred that the device is
   powered on. Note that it is difficult to infer that a device is
   powered off.  Also, there may be several states between power-on and
   power-off e.g. sleep state, power-saving state etc.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  GreenUsage  Monitoring Requirements

   Multiple mechanisms may be used to determine whether a device is
   powered on or not. The mechanisms will depend on the nature of the
   device. Since the number of devices may be very large, the
   identification, usage type, and location of devices needs to be addressed
   with care.

4.  MIB Design

   The basic principle has been to keep the MIB as simple as possible
   and at the same time to make it effective enough so that the
   essential needs of monitoring are met.

   The GreenUsage-MIB is composed of the following

       - device Table: a list of the devices that will be monitored
       - deviceStatus Table: the power-on/power-off status of the devices

6.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module with a
   MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.
   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:
                     gumDeviceName,
                     gumDeviceMacAddress,
                     gumDeviceType,
                     gumDeviceLocation,
                     gumDevUsageDetStatus,
                     gumDevUsageDetTimeStamp
         The above objects may be be used to identify users and their
         activities. Thus these objects may be considered to be
         particularly sensitive and/or private.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA should assign
         1. a base arc in the 'mib-2' (standards track) OID
            tree for the 'greenUsageMIB' MODULE-IDENTITY defined in the
