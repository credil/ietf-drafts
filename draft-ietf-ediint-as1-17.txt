This document describes how to exchange structured business data
securely using SMTP transport for Electronic Data Interchange,
(EDI - either the American Standards Committee X12 or UN/EDIFACT,
Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce and
Transport), XML or other data used for business to business data
interchange.  The data is packaged using standard MIME content-types.
Authentication and privacy are obtained by using Cryptographic Message
Syntax (S/MIME) or OpenPGP security body parts.  Authenticated
acknowledgements make use of multipart/signed replies to the original
SMTP message.
