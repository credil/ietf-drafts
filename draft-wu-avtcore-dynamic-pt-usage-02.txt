         Guideline for dynamic payload type number usage policy
                  draft-wu-avtcore-dynamic-pt-usage-02

Abstract

   The RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control
   (RTP/AVP) is the basis for many other profiles, such as the Secure
   Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP/SAVP), the Extended RTP Profile for
   Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/
   AVPF), and the Extended Secure RTP Profile for RTCP-Based Feedback
   (RTP/SAVPF).  This document provides guidelines for payload type
   number usage policy when dynamic payload type allocation is used.
   Also this document updates closed IANA registry "RTP Payload types
   (PT) for standard audio and video encodings".

1.  Introduction

   The RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control
   (RTP/AVP) [RFC3551]is the basis for many other profiles, such as the
   Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP/SAVP), the Extended RTP
   Profile for Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based
   Feedback (RTP/ AVPF), and the Extended Secure RTP Profile for RTCP-
   Based Feedback (RTP/SAVPF).  RTP Payload type can have the values 0
   to 127.  The binding of RTP payload format to Payload type can be
   static or dynamic.  [RFC3551] establishes the policy that no
   additional static payload types will be assigned beyond the ones
   defined.  As described in RFC5761, dynamic RTP payload types SHOULD
   be chosen first from the range 96-127.  Values below 64 MAY be used
   if that is insufficient.

   However some implementations may still exhaust the dynamic payload
   type numbering space before re-using a payload type within the scope
   of a local transport address.  This document provides guidelines for
   payload type number usage policy when dynamic payload type allocation
   is used.  Also this document updates closed IANA registry "RTP
   Payload types (PT) for standard audio and video encodings".

3.  Use of Dynamic payload type

   As described in section 3 of RFC3551 [RFC3551], the payload type
   number space is relatively small and cannot accommodate assignments
   for all existing and future encodings.  The registry for RTP Payload
   types (PT) for standard audio and video encodings [http://
   www.iana.org/assignments/rtp-parameters/rtp-parameters.xhtml#rtp-
   parameters-1] is closed.  New payload formats(e.g.,H.264,VP8) MUST
   use dynamic payload type number assignment.  Each new payload format
   MUST be named as "encoding name" by a registered media subtype
   defined in the "RTP Payload Format media types" registry.  The
   "encoding name" in the RTP payload type registry is also registered
   as a media subtype under the media type "audio" or "video" in the
   "RTP Payload Format media types" registry.

   When these dynamic payload types are used, SDP [RFC4566] or other
   protocols such as ITU-T Recommendation H.323/H.245[H323] [H245] are
   used to establish dynamic mapping between a payload type and an
   encoding.

   [RFC5761] discusses conflicts that may happen when multiplexing RTP
   and RTCP is the same transport stream.  When considering which
   payload type numbers should be used for mapping RTP dynamic streams,
   the documents does not differentiate between the cases when RTP and
   RTCP are multiplexed or not.

   When the dynamic mapping is needed, implementers can use the payload
   types in the lower range for dynamic payload type allocation,
   including the overriding the static ones.  Applications SHOULD first
   use values in the range [96-127]for dynamic payload types.  Those
   applications which need to define more than 32 dynamic payload types
   MAY bind codes below 96, in which case it is RECOMMENDED that
   unassigned payload type numbers [35-63] followed by [20-24], 27,
   [29-30].  If more payload type numbers are needed, the application
   may use the reserved values 1,2,19 (see [RFC3551]for reserved values)
   and 64, 65 (see [RFC5761]for reserved value)if H.261 FIR or H.261
   NACK is not used.  However using 64,65 may potentially cause
   collisions with legacy use.  If more Payload type numbers are needed,
   then applications may override the static types[0,
   3-18,25,26,28,31-34] and map encodings to these defined static
   payload type but this may cause problems for applications that ignore
   the mapping in the signaling and may assume a specific payload format
   based on the Payload Type.  If the application is sure that
   multiplexing RTP and RTCP are not used, the range 66 and 95 MAY be
   used but to add extra caution it will be better to use the pt numbers
   that are not conflicting with the currently assigned RTCP values.

   The table includes the different set of changes and make the current

   following changes:

   o  Change 1,2, 19 64-65 from "Reserved" to "reserved may be used for
      dynamic mapping" and reference this document.

   o  Change 66-71 to reserved for rtcp conflict avoidance.

   o  Change 72-82 to reserved used by RTCP.

   o  Change 83-95 to reserved for RTCP conflict avoidance.

      Editor note: do we want to recommend re-use of payload type in
      bundled m-lines if they map to the same payload format here?

4.  Security Considerations

   This document modifies the IANA allocation of RTP Payload Types in
   relationship to RFC 3551.  This policy change itself does not add
   security concerns to the ones in [RFC3551] and [RFC5761].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This section describes changes to the IANA Considerations sections
   outlined in RFC 3551 regarding the allocation of payload type number
   by IANA.

   Add to the note in http://www.iana.org/assignments/rtp-parameters/
   rtp-parameters.xhtml the following text "Policy for mapping of
   dynamic payload type numbers to payload format is defined in RFCxxxx
   [this document].

   The table in section 3 replaces the current closed table.

   The content of this document is the result of the work in the IETF
   Audio/Video Transport Core Maintenance (AVTCORE) working group.  We
   would therefore like to thank all the working group members who were
   involved in that discussion.  While it appears to be a fairly small
   change in the usage policy and allocation policy, the effect on
   implementations is rather dramatic.
