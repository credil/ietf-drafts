Internet-Draft             Mail Trace Fields                January 2012


   [RFC0822] defined Trace fields as fields providing trace information
   and which are used to provide an audit trail of message handling.
   Two header fields were defined as Trace fields; the "Received:"
   header field and the "Return-Path:" header field.  [RFC2822] in
   Section 3.6.6 defined Trace fields as a group of header fields
   consisting of an optional "Return-Path:" header field, and one or
   more "Received:" fields.  Restrictions on the syntax of Trace fields
   and the usage were provided in [RFC2821].

   [RFC5322] uses the same definition as in the previous paragraph and
   refers to [RFC5321] for any formal interpretation.  Although
   [RFC5322] defines only two Trace fields, in practice there are many
   other header fields that act as Trace fields.  Section 3.6.7 of
   [RFC5322] defined Resent Fields, which are also prepended to the
   message in the same fashion as Trace fields.

   This document updates the definition of Trace fields in [RFC5322],
   and adds a new column to the IANA registries of header fields to
   document which ones are Trace fields.

   DISCUSSION: [RFC3864] created a permanent message header fields
   registry and a provisional message header fields registry.  The
   applicable protocol in the IANA registries is either "mail", "mime",
   "http" or "netnews".  A sub-registry for the "mail" protocol could be
   used instead of the message header fields registries.

   In some documents, Trace Fields are referred to as Trace Header
   Fields.  The two terms are synonyms.  This document uses the shorter
   term Trace Fields.

1.1.  Note

   This Internet-Draft can be discussed on the apps-discuss@ietf.org
   mailing list.  [RFC-Editor: please remove this paragraph]

2.  Definitions

   This section defines various terms used throughout this document.

2.1.  General

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.2.  Email Specific

   [RFC5598] introduces several terms and concepts that are used in this
   memo, and thus readers are advised to become familiar with it as
   well.  Specifically, this document uses the terms Mail Transfer Agent
   (MTA), Mail User Agent (MUA), Mail Delivery Agent (MDA), and Mail
   Submission Agent (MSA).

Internet-Draft             Mail Trace Fields                January 2012


   The definition of Trace Fields in [RFC5322] is updated to include all
   of the header fields identified as Trace Fields in the IANA Permanent
   Message Header Fields and Provisional Message Header Fields
   registries.  The initial set of Trace Fields for those registries is
   listed in [ianainit].

3.1.  Usage of Trace Fields

   The desired property of a Trace field is that any header field
   defined as a Trace field SHOULD NOT be reordered within a message
   header block or changed.  In addition, a new Trace field SHOULD be
   added to the top of the message header block.  This makes it possible
   to infer the history of the message from the sequence of header
   fields.

   There can be zero or more occurences of a Trace field in a message
   header block.  Further restrictions may be defined for Trace fields
   by the specifications that provide for their use.

3.2.  Trace fields in mail-related specifications

   [RFC4408] defines the "Received-SPF:" header field as a Trace field
   and specifies that it must appear above all other "Received-SPF:"
   header fields.

   [RFC6376] specifies that the "DKIM-Signature:" header field should be
   treated as a Trace field and that it should not be reordered.  It
   mentions that the header field should be prepended to the message.
   DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) relies on maintaining the ordering
   of header fields as a change of any "DKIM signed" header field can
   invalidate the DKIM signature.

   [RFC5451] defines an "Authentication-Results:" header field.  It
   mentions that the field should be treated as a Trace field to get an
   idea of how far away authentication checks, such as DKIM and Sender
   Policy Framework [RFC4408] were done.

   [RFC5518] defines a "VBR-Info:" header field and mentions that a
   message may contain multiple occurences of these header fields.  The
   document relies on the terminology in [RFC5322] to say that the "VBR-
   Info:" header field is a "trace header field".  It also specifies
   that the header fields should be added at the top of the header
   fields.

   [RFC5436] defines an "Auto-Submitted:" header to be added to
   notification messages generated by Sieve filtering rules.  Section
   2.7.1 says "The "Auto-Submitted:" header field is considered a Trace
   field, similar to "Received:" header fields (see [RFC5321])."

4.  Issues

   a.  The recommendation that trace header fields should be kept in
       blocks is not always followed.  Some implementations add any new
       header field at the top of the message block without determining
       whether it is a Trace field.

   b.  Messages can be forwarded by users.  Adding Trace fields as part
       of the body of the forwarded message ends up confusing users.
       Some Trace fields are generally not relevant except for debugging
       mail delivery issues.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the Permanent Message Header Fields and
   Provisional Message Header Fields registries, defined in [RFC3864] to
   include a new column called Trace Field.  For each Header Field, this
   column may be blank, in which case the header field is not a Trace
   Field, or any of the tokens MTA, MUA, MSA, or MDA, to indicate that
   the header field is a Trace Field, and which component typically adds
   the header to a message.  The distinction among non-blank tokens is
   not normative, and a trace field MAY be added by any component that
   handles a message.

   The registration templates described in sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 of
   [RFC3864] are each updated to add a new section:

   Trace Field: Specify: blank, "MTA", "MUA", "MSA", or "MDA".  If this
      field is not an e-mail Trace Field, this section is left blank.
      If it is a Trace Field, the component that typically adds the
      field.

5.1.  Initial set of Trace Fields

   In the table below, the first column describes an existing Header
   Field, and the second column is the value to put in its Trace Field.
   The third column is for documentation, and is intended to match the
   existing contents of the Reference column in the registries.  For all
   headers not in this list, the initial value of the Trace Field is
   blank.

         +-------------------------+-------------+-----------+
         | Header Field Name       | Trace Field | Reference |
         +-------------------------+-------------+-----------+
         | Authentication-Results: | MTA         | [RFC5451] |
         | Auto-Submitted:         | MSA         | [RFC5436] |
         | DKIM-Signature:         | MSA         | [RFC6376] |
         | Received:               | MTA         | [RFC5322] |
         | Received-SPF:           | MTA         | [RFC4408] |
         | Resent-Date:            | MUA         | [RFC5322] |
         | Resent-From:            | MUA         | [RFC5322] |
         | Resent-Sender:          | MUA         | [RFC5322] |
         | Resent-To:              | MUA         | [RFC5322] |
         | Resent-Cc:              | MUA         | [RFC5322] |
         | Resent-Bcc:             | MUA         | [RFC5322] |
         | Resent-Message-ID:      | MUA         | [RFC5322] |
         | Return-Path:            | MDA         | [RFC5322] |
         | VBR-Info:               | MSA         | [RFC5518] |
         +-------------------------+-------------+-----------+

   Note: The Permanent Message Header Field Names registry currently
   lists [RFC3834] as the reference for the Auto-Submitted: field, but
   there is a later and more detailed description of it in [RFC5436]
   that describes it as a trace field.

6.  Security Considerations

   Some people view the disclosure of trace fields such as the
   "Received:" header field as a security risk as it may contain
   information about internal mail servers.  This lead to misguided
   attempts to strip "Received:" header fields to hide information.

   Trace fields are not guaranteed to be in a particular order; they
   have been known to be reordered occasionally when transported over
   the Internet.
