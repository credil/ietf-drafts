	<abstract>
		<t> This memo presents extensions to the DomainKeys Identified
		    Mail (DKIM) specification to allow for detailed reporting
		    of message authentication failures in an on-demand
		    fashion. </t>

	<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
		<t> <xref target="DKIM"/> introduced a mechanism for message
		    signing and authentication.  It uses digital signing to
		    associate a domain name with a message in a reliable
		    (i.e. not forgeable) manner.  The output is a verified
		    domain name that can then be subjected to some sort of
		    evaluation process (e.g., advertised sender policy,
		    comparison to a known-good list, submission to a
		    reputation service, etc.). </t>

		<t> Deployers of message authentication technologies
		    are increasingly seeking visibility into DKIM verification
		    failures and conformance failures involving the
		    published signing practices (e.g., <xref target="ADSP"/>)
		    of an Administrative Management Domain (ADMD; see
		    <xref target="EMAIL-ARCH"/>). </t>

		<t> This document extends <xref target="DKIM"/> and
		    <xref target="ADSP"/> to add an optional reporting
		    address and some reporting parameters.  Reports are
		    generated using the format defined in
		    <xref target="I-D.IETF-MARF-AUTHFAILURE-REPORT"/>. </t>

		<t> A domain name owner employing <xref target="DKIM"/> for
		    email signing and authentication might want to know when
		    signatures in use by specific keys are not successfully
		    verifying.  Currently there is no such mechanism
		    defined. </t>

		<t> This document adds optional "tags" (as defined in
		    <xref target="DKIM"/>) to the DKIM-Signature header field
		    and the DKIM key record in the DNS, using the formats
		    defined in that specification. </t>

		<section anchor="dkim-sig-tag"
		         title="Extension DKIM Signature Tag">
			<t> The following tag is added to DKIM-Signature header
			    fields when a Signer wishes to request that
			    reports of failed verifications be generated
			    by a Verifier:

			<list style="hanging">
				<t hangText="r="> Reporting Requested
				(plain-text; OPTIONAL; no default).  If
				present, this tag indicates that the Signer
				requests that Verifiers generate a report
				when verification of the DKIM signature
				fails.  At present, the only legal value
				is the single character "y" (in either upper
				or lower case).  A complete description and
				illustration of how this is applied can be

		</section>

		<section anchor="dkim-rep-tags"
		         title="DKIM Reporting TXT Record">
			<t> When a Signer wishes to advertise that it wants
			    to receive failed verification reports, it also
			    places in the DNS a TXT resource record (RR)
			    whose content follows the same general syntax as
			    DKIM key records, as defined in Section 3.6.1 of
			    <xref target="DKIM"/>, in that it is made up of
			    a sequence of tag-value objects.  In this case,
			    the tags and values comprise the parameters to
			    be used when generating the reports.  A report
			    generator will request the content of this record
			    when it sees an "r=" tag in a DKIM-Signature
			    header field. </t>

			<t> The reassembly rules of Section 3.6.2.2 of
			    <xref target="DKIM"/> also apply here if the
			    reporting TXT record consists of several string
			    fragments. </t>

			<t> Any tag found in the content of this record that
			    is not registered with IANA as described in
			    <xref target="iana-dkim-rep-tags"/> MUST be
			    ignored. </t>

			<t> The initial list of tags supported for the
			    reporting TXT record is as follows:

			    <list style="hanging">
				<t hangText="ra="> Reporting Address
				(plain-text; OPTIONAL).  A
				dkim-quoted-printable string (see Section
				2.11 of <xref target="DKIM"/>) containing the
				local-part of an email address to which a
				report SHOULD be sent when mail fails
				DKIM verification for one of the reasons
				enumerated below.  The value MUST be
				interpreted as a local-part only.  To
				construct the actual address to which the
				report is sent, the Verifier simply appends to
				this value an "@" followed by the domain
				name found in the "d=" tag of the
				DKIM-Signature header field.  Therefore, an
				ADMD making use of this specification MUST
				ensure that an email address thus constructed
				can receive reports generated as described in
				<xref target="generation"/>.  ABNF:

					<figure><artwork>
    rep-ra-tag = %x72.61 *WSP "=" *WSP qp-section
					</artwork></figure></t>

				<t hangText="rp="> Requested Report Percentage
				(plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "100").  The
				value is an integer from 0 to 100
				inclusive that indicates what percentage of
				incidents of signature authentication failures,
				selected at random, are to cause reports to be
				generated.  The report generator SHOULD NOT
				issue reports for more than the requested
				percentage of incidents.  Report generators
				MAY make use of the "Incidents:" field in
				<xref target="ARF"/> to indicate that there
				are more reportable incidents than there are
				reports.  ABNF:

					<figure><artwork>
    rep-rp-tag = %x72.70 *WSP "=" *WSP 1*3DIGIT
					</artwork></figure></t>

				<t hangText="rr="> Requested Reports
				(plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "all").  The
				value MUST be a colon-separated list of tokens
				representing those conditions under which a
				report is desired.  See
				<xref target="requests-dkim"/> for a list of
				valid tags.  ABNF:

					<figure><artwork>
    rep-rr-type = ( "all" / "d" / "o" / "p"/ "s" / "v" / "x" )
    rep-rr-tag = %x72.72 *WSP "=" *WSP rep-rr-type
                 *WSP 0* ( ":" *WSP rep-rr-type )
					</artwork></figure></t>

				<t hangText="rs="> Requested SMTP Error String
				(text; OPTIONAL; no default).  The value is a
				dkim-quoted-printable string that the
				publishing ADMD requests be included in
				<xref target="SMTP"/> error strings if
				messages are rejected during the delivery SMTP
				session.  ABNF:

					<figure><artwork>
    rep-rs-tag = %x72.73 *WSP "=" qp-section
					</artwork></figure></t>
				</list> </t>

			<t> In the absence of an "ra=" tag, the "rp=" and
			    "rr=" tags MUST be ignored, and the report
			    generator MUST NOT issue a report. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="dkim-algorithm"
		         title="DKIM Reporting Algorithm">
			<t> Report generators MUST apply the following
			    algorithm, or one semantically equivalent to
			    it, for each DKIM-Signature header field
			    whose verification fails for some reason.
			    Note that this processing is done as a reporting
			    extension only; the outcome of the specified DKIM
			    evaluation MUST be otherwise unaffected. 
			   
			<list style="numbers">
				<t> If the DKIM-Signature field did not
				    contain a valid "r=" tag, terminate. </t>

				<t> Issue a <xref target="DNS"/> TXT query to
				    the name that results from appending
				    the value of the "d=" tag in the
				    DKIM-Signature field to the string
				    "_report._domainkey.".  For example, if the
				    DKIM-Signature header field contains
				    "d=example.com", issue a DNS TXT query to
				    "_report._domainkey.example.com". </t>

				<t> If the DNS query returns anything other
				    than a success status code (0), also
				    known as NOERROR, or if multiple TXT
				    records are returned, terminate. </t>

				<t> If the resultant TXT is in several
				    string fragments, reassemble it as
				    described in Section 3.6.2.2 of
				    <xref target="DKIM"/>. </t>

				<t> If the TXT content is syntactically
				    invalid, the implementation,
				    terminate. </t>

				<t> If the reason for the signature evaluation
				    failure does not match one of the report
				    requests found in the "rr=" tag (or its
				    default value), terminate. </t>

				<t> If a report percentage ("rp=") tag was
				    present, select a random number between
				    0 and 99, inclusive; if the selected number
				    is higher than the tag's value,
				    terminate. </t>

				<t> If no "ra=" tag was present, skip this step
				    and the next one.  Otherwise, determine
				    the reporting address by extracting the
				    value of the "ra=" tag and appending to
				    it "@" followed by the domain name found
				    in the "d=" tag of the DKIM-Signature
				    header field. </t>

				<t> Construct and send a report in compliance
				    with <xref target="generation"/> of this
				    memo that includes as its intended
				    recipient the address constructed in the
				    previous step. </t>

				<t> If the <xref target="SMTP"/> session
				    during which the DKIM signautre was
				    evaluated is still active and the SMTP
				    server has not already given its response
				    to the DATA command that relayed the
				    message, and an "rs=" tag was present
				    in the TXT record, the SMTP server SHOULD
				    include the decoded string found in the
				    "rs=" tag in its SMTP reply to the DATA
				    command. </t>
			</list> </t>

			<t> This algorithm has the following advantages over
			    previous implementations:

			    <list style="letters">
				<t> If the DKIM signature fails to verify,
				    no additional DNS check is made to see
				    if reporting is requested; the request
				    is active in that it is included in the
				    DKIM-Signature header field.  (Previous
				    implementations included the reporting
				    address in the DKIM key record, which is
				    not queried for certain failure cases.
				    This meant, for full reporting, that the
				    key record had to be retrieved even when
				    it was not otherwise necessary.) </t>

				<t> The request is confirmed by the presence
				    of a corresponding TXT record in the DNS,
				    since the Signer thus provides the
				    parameters required to construct and send
				    the report.  This means a malicious
				    Signer cannot falsely assert that someone
				    else wants failure reports and cause
				    unwanted mail to be generated.  It can
				    cause additional DNS traffic against the
				    domain listed in the "d=" signature tag,
				    but negative caching of the requested DNS
				    record will help to mitigate this
				    issue. </t>

				<t> It is not possible for a Signer to direct
				    reports to an email address outside of its
				    own domain, preventing distributed
				    email-based denial-of-service attacks. </t>
			    </list></t>

			<t> The above procedure does not permit the detection
			    and reporting of messages including a fraudulent
			    DKIM-Signature header field, where such signature
			    did not include an "r=" tag.  It might be useful
			    to some Signers to receive such reports, but this
			    use case is not supported.  To support this, a
			    Verifier would have to violate the first
			    step above and continue even in the absence of
			    an "r=" tag.  Although this satisfies this
			    reporting requirement (which is expected to be
			    unusual), it also creates a possible
			    denial-of-service attack as such Verifiers will
			    always look for the reporting TXT record, so
			    the generator of fraudulent messages could simply
			    send a large volume of such messages to a
			    number of destinations.  Thus, the specified
			    algorithm does not accommodate this case. </t>

	<section anchor="dkim-adsp-update"
	         title="Optional Reporting Address for DKIM-ADSP">
		<t> There also exist cases in which a domain name owner
		    employing <xref target="ADSP"/>
		    for announcing signing practises with DKIM
		    may want to know when messages are received without
		    valid author domain signatures.  Currently there is no
		    such mechanism defined. </t>

		<t> This document adds the following optional "tags"
		    (as defined in <xref target="ADSP"/>) to the DKIM ADSP
		    records, using the form defined in that specification:

		<list style="hanging">
			<t hangText="ra="> Reporting Address (plain-text;

			the verification algorithm described in
			<xref target="ADSP"/>, in particular because a message
			arrived without a signature that validates,
			which contradicts what the ADSP record claims.  The
			value MUST be interpreted as a local-part only.  To
			construct the actual address to which the report is
			sent, the Verifier simply appends to this value an
			"@" followed by the domain whose policy was queried
			in order to evaluate the sender's ADSP, i.e., the
			one taken from the RFC5322.From domain of the message
			under evaluation. Therefore, a signer making
