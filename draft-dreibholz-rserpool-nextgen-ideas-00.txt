Internet-Draft       RSerPool Next Generation Ideas         October 2013


   o  TCP: Transmission Control Protocol

   o  VNFPOOL: Virtual Network Function Resource Pooling

1.2.  Reliable Server Pooling

   Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool) has been defined as RFCs in [1],
   [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8].  There is also a detailed
   introduction provided by [16] as well as lots of further information
   material on [17].  RSerPool is therefore not introduced in more
   detail here.

1.3.  Scope

   The scope of this document is to collect some ideas of what to update
   /change for a next generation of the RSerPool framework.  It is a
   result of lessons learned with more than one decade of RSerPool
   deployment (see also [18], [19], [20]) as well as ongoing discussions
   on applying RSerPool for Virtual Network Function Resource
   Pooling (VNFPOOL; as introduced in more detail in [15]).

2.  What to Change in the Next Generation of RSerPool?

   o  ENRP servers denote the management systems in the context of
      RSerPool.  The term "server" is misleading, since ENRP servers are
      actually ENRP peers.  Literature on RSerPool -- for example [16]
      -- therefore uses the more accurate term "Pool Registrar" (PR).  A
      future revision of RSerPool should also use this term.  (The
      RSerPool documents did not use "registrar" to avoid confusion with
      SIP registrars.)

   o  Pool Element Identifiers (PE ID) and Pool Registrar
      Identifiers (PR ID) are 32-bit random numbers used for the
      identification of PEs and PRs.  Since 64-bit CPUs are standard
      since quite a long time, these IDs should be extended to 64 bits.

   o  ENRP uses the Internet-16 checksum defined in [9] to detect
      handlespace inconsistencies.  It is trivially possible to extend
      the underlying algorithm to 32 bits, and the computation is more
      efficient on today's CPUs.  The checksum algorithm should
      therefore be changed.  (The Internet-16 checksum was finally
      chosen in 2005 after long decisions to avoid any possible patent
      issues.  The trivial extension of Internet-16 to Internet-32 is
      probably not an issue any more?)

   o  PR failures lead to possible concentration of all PUs and PEs at a
      single PR.  To achieve a better load balancing, the solution ENRP
      Takeover Suggestion -- as defined in [14] -- should be included in
      ENRP.

   o  For a Handle Resolution, a PR has to decide on how many PEs to
      select.  Selecting too many ones causes additional overhead (which
      might be unnecessary), selecting too few ones may cause problems
      for the applications.  The extension Handle Resolution Option --
      defined in [12] -- provides a possibility for the PU to specify
      the amount of PEs to be selected.  This possibility should be
      integrated into ASAP.

   o  RSerPool defines SCTP (defined in [10]) as transport protocol for
      RSerPool.  TCP and particularly Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP; see [11])
      should be possible further transport protocols for all RSerPool
      traffic.  SCTP should still be the recommended choice, but
      allowing TCP/MPTCP could make the deployment much easier.  (SCTP
      is superior, but it lacks of support in operating systems and
      support by underlying network infrastructure, like firewalls and
      middleboxes.)

2.1.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for RSerPool can be found in [6].

2.2.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces no additional considerations for IANA.

3.  Reference Implementation

   The RSerPool reference implementation RSPLIB, including example
   applications, can be found at [17].  It supports the functionalities
   defined by [2], [3], [4], [5] and [6] as well as the options [12],
   [14] and [13].  An introduction to this implementation is provided in
   [16].

4.  Testbed Platform

   NorNet is a large-scale and realistic Internet testbed platform with
   support for Reliable Server Pooling as well as the underlying
   transport protocols SCTP and MPTCP.  A description of and
   introduction to NorNet is provided in [20], [21], [22].  Further
   information can be found on the project website [23] at http://
   www.nntb.no.
