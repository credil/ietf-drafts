Abstract

   Two alternate methods of encoding Multi Topology Identifier within
   the TRILL data frames are presented. Methods proposed herein do not
   require overloading TRILL RBridge nickname to encode Multi Topology
   Identifier. A method that expands TRILL nickname space from 16bits
   to 24 bits is also presented in this draft.

1. Introduction

   Multi Topology is an attractive concept that allows creating
   different virtual topologies or overlays on top of a single physical
   topology. There are several important applications. Few such
   applications are listed below. The list below is by no means an
   exhaustive list and there are other applications that may utilize
   the MT framework.

   Application specific topology (Storage topology vs. data topology)

   Virtual topologies for different customers

   Expansion of TRILL nickname space

   Traffic Engineering

   [RFC5120] presents Multi topology (MT) framework for IS-IS. MT has
   two important parts; IS-IS control plane extensions and Data plane
   encoding. [RFC5120] presents IS-IS control plane extensions. [TRILL-
   MT1] and [TRILL-MT2] presents required IS-IS sub-TLV definitions and
   the data plane encoding for TRILL.

   In this document we propose methods that facilitate encoding of 16
   bit Multi topology ID in to TRILL frames without reducing the
   effective TRILL nickname space. Additionally, the proposed scheme
   does not require definition of new Topology mapping sub-TLV. In
   other words, IS-IS control plane is similar to [RFC5120] and does
   not require additional complexity of mapping absolute Topology ID to
   abbreviated topology ID.

   Methods proposed in this document encode the MT topology ID into
   TRILL data frames without modifying the TRILL header. Hence, MT
   capable, RBridges interfacing with non-MT capable RBridges can
   selectively not encode the proposed MT extensions on interfaces with
   non-MT capable RBridges. Non MT capable RBridges do not required to
   be in the base topology. They can be in any valid topology. Only
   restriction is non-MT capable RBridges can belong to a single
   topology only. In its IS-IS HELLO messages, RrRidges exchange its MT
   capability and topology information. RBridges that are not capable
   of supporting proposed MT extension in data plane, MUST announce
   itself as non MT capable, but MAY advertise its association to a
   topology other than the base topology by including MT extensions
   proposed in [RFC5120]. MT encoding capability is announced by
   setting the proposed MT encoding capability bit in Port TRILL
   Version sub-TLV [rfc6326bis]. Presence of IS-IS Multi Topology TLV
   [RFC5120], indicates only the associated topology. MT encoding

   capability indicates RBRidges ability to support proposed data plane
   extensions. When MT capability is not set RBridge MUST not use the
   proposed data plane encoding methods, instead it must associate the
   announcing RBRidge to the advertised topology or base topology in
   the absence of Multi-Topology TLV [RFC5120].

   TRILL protocol, as defined in [RFC6325], defines 16bit nickname
   space. 16bit nickname space allows up to 65536 unique nicknames.
   However, it has been discussed in the working group that, more the
   65536 unique names are required in certain large deployments.
   Possible usage of  Upperbits of Nickname is also being considered
   for encoding Multitoplogy, which further reduces the available nick
   name space. Presented in this document is a method that allows
   expanding the 16bit nickname space to a 24bit nickname space,
   without modifying the TRILL header defined in [RFC6325].





2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

3. Multi Topology Encoding

   [RFC6325] TRILL Base Protocol, proposes encoding scheme of TRILL
   frames. TRILL frames contain outer MAC Header, 802.1QTAG, TRILL
   header and user Data. We propose to include multi topology ID after
   the 802.1Q TAG. Multi Toplogy ID is preceded by Ethernet Type MT-
   ETHTYPE.

3.1. Nickname construction

   Each RBridge that is compatible with the proposed scheme, First
   check for presence of Nick-Ethtype, if present extract the EG-NICKN-
   MSB and IG-NICKN-MSB. EG-NICKN-MSB and IG-NICKN-MSB are then
   concatenated with the Egress TRILL nickname and the Ingress TRILL
   nickname to form 24bit nickname space. The derived nickname MUST be
   utilized for forwarding.



3.2. Use of Next-Hop VLAN for MT Encoding

   Alternatively, Next-Hop VLAN may be utilized to encode MT ID in
   point to point only networks. Next Hop VLAN on TRILL outer header is

   independent of the inner VLAN. On Point-Pont links Next Hop VLAN is
   only required to be of local significance. Hence, we propose to map
   topologies to Next-Hop VLAN per link basis.

   For sake of simplicity, we propose to map topology-id to Next-VLAN
   based on local policies such as configuration.

4. Multi Topology Interoperability

   There are three possible scenarios of Interoperability with RBridges
   that are non-MT capable.

   1. Interoperability During migration.
   2. Interoperability with RBridges that are non-MT capable in the data
     plane. (i.e. Software is MT aware and supports the extensions
     specified here-in but, data plane is not capable of supporting the
     proposed encoding methods).
   3. Interoperability with Rbridges that are MT unaware in both Control
     and data planes.

4.1. Interoperability during Migration

    We recommend upgrading from the core to the edge, as depicted in
   the figure below. With this approach, different clusters of RBridges
   may belong to different topologies or to the same topology. RBridges
   in the core provide connectivity to RBridge clusters at the edge in
   a topology aware manner.

   In the above diagram Core may be configured to connect Edge 1 and
   Edge 2 to a different Topology than the topology of Edge 3 and Edge
   4.

   RBridges in Edge 1 - 4 are not required to be MT capable or aware.
   RBridges in the core associate the corresponding links to the
   appropriate topology.

4.2. Interoperability with RBridges with Non MT capable data plane

   RBridges with Non MT capable data plane may implement MT support by
   dedicating a separate link for each topology.

   Alternatively, RBRidges, on point-point links may assign a different
   next hop VLAN for different topologies and derive topology ID based
   on VLAN. Use Next-Hop VLAN reduces the need for multiple physical

   links.  This method may be utilized as a permanent method for MT
   encoding in Point-Pont only networks.

4.3. Interoperability with MT unaware RBRdiges

   MT aware RBridges identify MT unaware RBridges with either not
   presence of capability flags (pre RFC6326bis) or MT capability flags
   not being set (Section 6.1. ). In such an event MT aware RBridges
   MUST only forward traffic related to the base topology to MT unaware
   RBridges. Additionally, proposed encoding MUST be removed prior to
   forwarding to MT unaware RBRidges.

5. Backward compatibility

   The proposed methods are encoded as part of the outer header of the
   TRILL frame. An RBridge that is aware of the proposed extensions
   when interfacing with an RBridge that is not capable of the proposed
   extensions MUST remove the proposed encoding from the outer header,
   prior to transmission of TRILL frames on those links that has
   RBridges that are not capable of the proposed extensions.

6. IS-IS sub-TLV definition

6.1. MT capability

   We propose to define two MT capability flags within Port TRILL
   Version sub-TLV.

   1. MT Encoding capability
   2. MT to NH-VLAN Encoding capability

   MT Encoding capability flag indicates the RBridge is capable
   encoding MT ID using ETHTYPE-MT as defined in section 3.

   MT to NH-VLAN Encoding capability flag indicates the announcing
   RBRidge is capable of using NH-VLAN to MT ID mapping as presented in
   section 3.2.

   When both of the flags are set RBRridge SHOULD select MT Encoding
   capability.

8. Assignment  Considerations

8.1.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate MT Encoding capability Flag,MT to NH-
   VLAN Encoding capability Flags and Nickname MSB capability flag
   under Port TRILL version sub-TLV.

8.2. IEEE Considerations

   IEEE is requested to assign new Ether Type to represent MT-ETHTYPE
   defined in section 3.
