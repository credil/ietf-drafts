PCEP Protocol Extension for spectrum utilization optimization in Flexi-
                             Grid Networks
               draft-zhaoyl-pce-flexi-grid-pcep-ex-01

Abstract

   Flexi-grid networks overcomes the fixed grid channel of Wavelength
   Switched Optical Network(WSON) by flexible spectrum to allow non-
   uniform and dynamic allocation of spectrum based on the demand of the
   incoming services' LSP.  Flexi-grid networks is an effective solution
   to solve the problem of efficient spectrum utilization.

   Because the client LSP needs to be assigned contiguous spectrum in
   flexi-grid networks, there will be two problems that would affect
   spectrum utilization, i.e.  RSA and fragmentation.  We introduce two
   kinds of methods which can improve the spectrum utilization further,
   and some related PCEP extensions are defined in this document.

1.  Introduction

   Demand of traffic is increasing exponentially and already approaching
   the limit of single mode fiber capacity.  At the same time, because
   of varying demand of trafficGBP[not]we need an efficient and agile
   utilization of the optical spectrum.

   ITU-T Study Group 15 introduce a new flexi-grid networks to enable
   dynamic allocation of spectrum resource.  The flexi-grid networks is
   an effective solution to solve the problem of efficient spectrum
   resource utilization.

   The granularity of flexi-grid networks can be smaller and agile.
   i.e.(6.25GHz).In the flexi-grid networks, the appropriate size of
   spectrum is determined by the used modulation format.According to the
   client data rate request and physical constraints of the selected
   path,the appropriate size of spectrum is adaptively allocated to
   optical connections by assigning the appropriate number of contiguous
   spectrum from end-to-end.Before assigning the client request, we have
   to find suitable route and fit contiguous spectrum for it, and it is
   a complex process.  So spectrum utilization is very important in RSA.
   While there are several algorithms for RSA, so flexi-grid networks
   require to extend PCEP protocol to support different algorithms
   seletion.

   Upon tearing down of connections, allocated spectrum are released for
   future requests.  In a dynamic traffic scenario, this channel setup
   and tear down processes leads to fragmentation of spectral resources.
   Due to the fragmentation, the available spectrum divide into small
   noncontiguous spectral bands,the spectral effciency in the network is
   compromised.  Therefore the probability of finding suffcient
   contiguous spectrum for a connection is decreased.  We introduce
   Spectrum Fragments Cascading and Defragmentation to deal with
   fragmentation in flexi-grid networks.  So PCEP protocol have to add
   some messages to support them.

4.  RSA

4.1.  Introduction of RSA

   This part we focuses on the routing and spectrum assignment (RSA)
   problem.  This problem can be partitioned into two subproblems - (1)
   routing and (2) wavelength assignment and each subproblem can be
   solved separately.  Different from traditional WDM network, flexi-
   grid networks assign continuous spectrum for new arrival request.
   Static planning models used for flexi-grid networks to improve
   spectrum utilization.

4.2.  Algorithms of RSA

   There are several spectrum assignment algorithms.

   (1)Random Fit (RF)

   This scheme first searches the space of wavelengths to determine the
   set of all spectrum that are available on the required route.  Among
   the available wavelengths, one is chosen randomly.

   (2)First-Fit (FF)

   In this scheme, all spectrum is numbered.When searching for available
   spectrum, a lower numbered spectrum is considered before a higher-
   numbered spectrum.The first available spectrum is then selected.
   Compared to Random spectrum assignment, the computation cost of this
   scheme is lower because there is no need to search the entire
   spectrum space for each route.

   (3)Least-Used (LU)/SPREAD

   LU selects the spectrum that is the least used in the network,
   thereby attempting to balance the load among all the spectrum.  The
   performance of LU is worse than Random, while also introducing
   additional communication overhead (e.g., global information is
   required to compute the least-used spectrum).

   (4)Most-Used (MU)/PACK

   MU is the opposite of LU in that it attempts to select the most-used
   spectrum in the network.  The communication overhead, storage, and



Zhao, et al.            Expires October 27, 2012                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               PCEP Extension                   April 2012


   computation cost are all similar to those in LU.MU also slightly
   outperforms FF, doing a better job of packing connections into fewer
   wavelengths and conserving the spare capacity of less-used
   wavelengths.

   (5)Min-Product (MP)

   MU is the opposite of LU works.  In a single fiber network, MP
   becomes FF.  The goal of MP is to pack wavelengths into fibers,
   thereby minimizing the number of fibers in the network.

   (6)Least-Loaded (LL)

   The LL heuristic, like MP, is also designed for multi-fiber networks.
   This heuristic selects the spectrum that has the largest residual
   capacity on the most loaded link along route.

   (7)MAX-SUM (MS)

   MS was proposed for multi-fiber networks but it can also be applied
   to the single-fiber case.MS considers all possible paths in the
   network and attempts to maximize the remaining path capacities after
   lightpath establishment.

   (8)Relative Capacity Loss (RCL)

   RCL is based on MS.  RCL chooses spectrum to minimize the relative
   capacity loss.  RCL is based on the observation that minimizing total
   capacity loss sometimes does not lead to the best choice of spectrum.

   (9)Spectrum Reservation (Rsv)

   In Rsv, a given spectrum on a specified link is reserved for a
   traffic stream, usually a multihop stream.  This scheme reduces the
   blocking for multihop traffic,while increasing the blocking for
   connections that traverse only one fiber link (single-hop traffic).

   (10)Protecting Threshold (Thr)

   In Thr, a single-hop connection is assigned spectrum only if the
   number of idle spectrum on the link is at or above a given threshold.

4.3.  RSA Schemes Selection

   There are several spectrum assignment algorithms , we have to choose
   one of them for use in flexi-grid networks.  Diffrent RSA schemes
   selected according to diffrent network condition.  The PCEP protocol
   need to extend a bit that provide different Schemes to choose.

5.  Defragmentation

5.1.  Motivation of Defragmentation

   New arrival of requests are then either forced to utilize more
   spectrum in the network or blocked in spite of suffcient spectrum
   being available.  Additionally, as the network evolves, a current
   optimal routing scheme might no longer provide the optimal spectral
   utilization over time.  There is an increasing demand from the
   network operators to be able to periodically recon?gure the network
   and return it to its optimal state, so that the network can operate
   more effciently.

5.2.   Definition of Defragmentation

   There is an operation defined as network defragmentation to solve
   above problem.  Reducing the blocking by consolidating the available
   network resources, this operation will also enable better network
   maintenance and more effcient network restoration and bandwidth
   adjustment.

5.3.   Application Scene of Defragmentation

   The process of defragmentation: (1) select which LSP to
   defragmentation, interrupt it, (2) choose forward spectrum in
   original route or new route, (3) move the LSP on possible spectrum.

   An example of defragentation is as following: A,B,C are client LSPs
   on link l, l1 is Original statement of link l,l2 is statement of link
   l after defragementation.


                +-------------+          +----+     +---------+
           l1:  |     A       |          | B  |     |   C     |
                +-------------+----------+----+-----+---------+--
                +-------------+----+-----------+
           l2:  |     A       | B  |    C      |
                +-------------+----+-----------+-----



   we first focus on the problem of the time-point when should
   defragmentation be operated.  So far, two new concepts proposed to
   solve this problem.  One concept is Utilization Entropy that
   represents the level of resource fragmentation in an optical network
   proposed by Fujitsu Labs of America; the other concept is Spectrum
   Compactness that represents the spectrum distribution state in a link
   or in the network proposed by State key Laboratory of Information

   Photonics and Optical Communications of Beijing University of Posts
   and Telecommunications.  These two methods both related to threshold,
   it necessary to set threshold, when reaching threshold triggered
   defragmentation.  PCEP protocol should include these information.

   we consider the methods of defragmentation.  At present, there are
   two methods for defragmentation.  First is change route of client LSP
   means the spectrum of this LSP in new route is ahead than the
   spectrum in original route.  Second is the LSP move forward directly
   in original route.

   Defragmentation has to interrupt the traffic; the application scene
   is leisure network.  When the network is busy, defragmentation lead
   to the increase of interrupt traffic demands.

   Before defragmentation for the network, we have to do static
   programming for existing traffic demand in the network.  We hope the
   defragmentation result reach or approach the static programming.

   Maybe some network has requirement of interrupting rate or
   defragmentation time and so on, we should provide corresponding
   information to meet above requirements.


6.  PCEP Protocol Extension

6.1.  PCEP Protocol Extension for RSA

   The PCEP protocol need to be extended to support the Algorithms
   choosing of RSA.  PCReq need to adding RAEO-list information.  This
   information include "Algorithm Id", which stand for the number of
   different algorithms, and "Pri" that means priority of these
   algorithms.

6.2.  PCEP Protocol Extension for Defragmentation

   The presence of defragmentation in Flexi-Grid Networks has an impact
   on the information that needs to be transferred by the control plane
   and the PCE.  Defragmentation has to interrupt the traffic and move
   it to another spectrum or route.  The PCEP protocol needs to be
   extended two messages to support defragmentation, including
   information of original route/spectrum and present route/spectrum,
   when to stop defragmentation, the selection of methods and the limit
   of corresponding factors and so on.

   Here is Spectrum Defragmentation Request Message and Spectrum
   Defragmentation Reply Message.  "Target Clutter Value" stand for the
   threshold of defragmentation.  "R" means whether the network MUST
   make it."Id 1" is number of defragmentation methods, "Id 2" is number
   of methods to trigger defragmentation, "L" means limit of
   interrupting rate or defragmentation time.
