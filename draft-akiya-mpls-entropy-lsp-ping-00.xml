      <t>The Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Path
	(LSP) Ping and Traceroute are used to exercise specific paths of
	Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP). This ability has been lost on some

	Labels (EL).
      </t>
      
      <t>This document extends the MPLS LSP Ping and Traceroute
        mechanisms to restore the ability of exercising specific paths
        of ECMP over LSP which make use of Entropy Label. This

    <section title="Introduction" anchor="INTRO">

      <t>Section 3.3.1 of <xref target="RFC4379" /> specifies
      multipath information encoding which can be used by LSP Ping
      initiator to trace and validate all ECMP paths between ingress
      and egress. These encodings are sufficient when all the LSRs along
      the path(s), between ingress and egress, consider same set of
      &quot;keys&quot; as input for load balancing algorithm: all IP
      based or all label based.</t>

      <t>With introduction of <xref target="RFC6790" />, it is quite
        normal to see set of LSRs performing load balancing based on
        EL/ELI while others still follow the traditional way (IP
        based). This results in LSP Ping initiator not be able to
        trace and validate all ECMP paths in following scenarios:

	<list style="symbols">

	  <t>One or more transit LSRs along ELI/EL imposed LSP do not
	  perform ECMP load balancing based on EL (hashes based on
	  &quot;keys&quot; including IP destination address). This
	  scenario is not only possible but quite common due transit
	  LSRs not implementing <xref target="RFC6790" /> or transit
	  LSRs implementing <xref target="RFC6790" /> but not
	  implementing suggested transit LSR behavior in Section 4.3
	  of <xref target="RFC6790" />.</t>

	  <t>Two or more LSPs stitched together with at least one LSP
	  being ELI/EL imposing LSP. Such scenarios are described in
	  <xref target="I-D.ravisingh-mpls-el-for-seamless-mpls" />.
	  </t>

	</list>

	These scenarios will be quite common because every deployment
	of <xref target="RFC6790" /> will invariably end up with nodes
	that support ELI/EL and nodes that do not. There will
	typically be areas that support ELI/EL and areas that do
	not.</t>

      <t>As pointed out in <xref target="RFC6790" /> the procedures of
	<xref target="RFC4379" /> with respect to multipath
	information type {9} are incomplete.  However <xref target="RFC6790" /> does
	not actually update <xref target="RFC4379" />.  Further the specific EL location
	is not clearly defined, particularly in the case of FAT
	Pseudowires <xref target="RFC6391" />.  Herein is defined a
	new FEC Stack sub-TLV for the Entropy Label.
	<xref target="MPT9-Sec" /> of this document updates the
	procedures for multipath information type {9}.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Overview">

      <t><xref target="RFC4379" /> describes LSP traceroute as an
      operation performed through initiating LSR sending LSP Ping
      packet (LSP echo request) with incrementing TTL, starting with
      TTL of one. Initiating LSR discovers and exercises ECMP by
      obtaining multipath information from each transit LSR and using
      specific destination IP address or specific entropy label.</t>

      <t>LSP Ping initiating LSR sends LSP echo request with multipath
      information. This multipath information is described in
      DSMAP/DDMAP TLV of echo request, and can contain set of IP
      addresses or set of labels today. Multipath information types
      {2, 4, 8} carry set of IP addresses and multipath information
      type {9} carries set of labels. Responder LSR (receiver of LSP
      echo request) is to determine subset of initiator specified
      multipath information which load balances to each downstream
      (outgoing interface). Responder LSR sends LSP echo reply with
      resulting multipath information per downstream (outgoing
      interface) back to the initiating LSR. Initiating LSR is then able
      to use specific IP destination address or specific label to
      exercise specific ECMP path on the responder LSR.</t>

      <t>Current behavior is problematic in following scenarios:

	<list style="symbols">

	  <t>Initiating LSR sends IP multipath information, but
	    responder LSR load balances on labels.</t>

	  <t>Initiating LSR sends label multipath information, but
	    responder LSR load balances on IP addresses.</t>

	  <t>Initiating LSR sends any of existing multipath information
	    to ELI/EL imposing LSR, but initiating LSR can only
	    continue to discover and exercise specific path of ECMP if
	    ELI/EL imposing LSR responds with both IP addresses and
	    associated EL corresponding to each IP address. This is
	    because:

	    <list style="symbols">

	      <t>ELI/EL imposing LSR that is a stitching point will
	      load balance based on IP address.</t>

	      <t>Downstream LSR(s) of ELI/EL imposing LSR may load
	      balance based on ELs.</t>

	    </list>

	  </t>

	  <t>Initiating LSR sends any of existing multipath information
             to ELI/EL imposing LSR, but initiating LSR can only
             continue to discover and exercise specific path of ECMP
             if ELI/EL imposing LSR responds with both labels and
             associated EL corresponding to label. This is because:

	    <list style="symbols">

	      <t>ELI/EL imposing LSR that is a stitching point will
	      load balance based on EL from previous LSP and imposes
	      new EL.</t>

	      <t>Downstream LSR(s) of ELI/EL imposing LSR may load
	      balance based on new ELs.</t>

	    </list>

	  </t>

	</list>

	The above scenarios point to how the existing multipath
	information is insufficient when LSP traceroute is operated on
	an LSP with Entropy Labels described by <xref target="RFC6790"
	/>. Therefore, this document defines a multipath information
	type to be used in the DSMAP/DDMAP of LSP echo request/reply
	packets in <xref target="MPT10" />.
      </t>

      <t>In addition, responder LSR can reply with empty multipath
      information if no IP address set or label set from received
      multipath information matched load balancing to a
      downstream. Empty return is also possible if initiating LSR sends
      multipath information of one type, IP address or label, but
      responder LSR load balances on the other type. To disambiguate
      between the two results, this document introduces new flags in
      the DSMAP/DDMAP TLV to allow responder LSR to describe the load
      balance technique being used.</t>

      <t>It is required that all LSRs along the LSP understand new
      flags as well as new multipath information type. It is also
      required that initiating LSR can select both IP destination
      address and label to use on transmitting LSP echo request
      packets. Two additional DS Flags are defined for the DSMAP and
      DDMAP TLVs in <xref target="DS_Flags" />.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Multipath Type 9" anchor="MPT9-Sec">

      <t>
	<xref target="RFC4379" /> defined multipath type {9} for tracing of LSPs where
        label based load-balancing is used.  However, as pointed out
        in <xref target="RFC6790" />, the procedures for using this type are incomplete.
	First, the specific location of the label was not defined.
        What was assumed, but not spelled out, was that the presence
        of multipath type {9} meant the responder
        should act as if the payload of the received packet were
        non-IP and that the bottom-of-stack label should be replaced
        by the values indicated by multipath type {9} to determine
        their respective out-going interfaces.
      </t>

      <t>
	Further, with the introduction of <xref target="RFC6790" />, entropy labels may
	now appear anywhere in a label stack.
      </t>

      <t>
	This section defines to which labels multipath type {9} can
	apply.  Additionally it defines procedures for tracing
	pseudowires and flow-aware pseudowires.  These procedures
	pertain to the use of multipath information type {9} as well
	as type {10}.
      </t> 

      <t>
	<xref target="EL_FEC" /> defines a new FEC-Stack sub-TLV to
	indicate and entropy label.  Multipath type {9} applies
	exclusively to this sub-TLV.  Any LSP Ping message containing
	a DD-MAP or DS-MAP with multipath type {9} MUST include an
	EL_FEC at the bottom of the FEC-Stack.
      </t>

      <t>When an MPLS echo request message is received containing a
	FEC-Stack with an EL-FEC at the bottom of the FEC stack and is
	not preceded by an entropy label, the responder must behave
	(for load balancing purposes) as if the first word of the
	message were a Pseudowire Control Word.
      </t>  

      <t>In order to trace a non-FAT pseudowire, instead of
	including the appropriate PW-FEC in the FEC-Stack, an EL-FEC
	is included.  Tracing in this way will cause compliant routers
	to return the proper outgoing interface.  Note that this
	procedure only traces to the end of the MPLS transport LSP
	(e.g. LDP and/or RSVP).  To actually verify the PW-FEC or in
	the case of a MS-PW, to determine the next pseudowire label
	value, the initiator MUST repeat that step of the trace, (i.e.,
	repeating the TTL value used) but with the FEC-Stack
	modified to contain the appropriate PW-FEC.
      </t>

      <t>In order to trace a FAT pseudowire, the initiator
	includes an EL-FEC at the bottom of the FEC-Stack and pushes
	the appropriate PW-FEC onto the FEC-Stack.  
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Initiating LSR Procedures">
      
      <t>In order to facilitate the flow of the following text we
	speak in terms of a boolean called EL_LSP maintained by the
	initiating LSR. This value controls the multipath information type to be
	used in transmitted echo request packets. When the initiating LSR is
	transmitting an echo request packet with DSMAP/DDMAP with a non-zero
	multipath information type, then EL_LSP boolean MUST be consulted to
	determine the multipath information type to use.
      </t>

      <t>In addition to procedures described in <xref target="RFC4379"
						      /> as updated by <xref target="MPT9-Sec" /> and <xref target="RFC6424" />, initiating LSR MUST operate
	with following procedures.
	
	<list style="symbols">

      <t>Entropy Label (EL) is a special purpose label with label
        value being discretionary (i.e. label value may not be from
        the reserved range). For LSP verification mechanics to perform
        its purpose, it is necessary for a Target FEC Stack sub-TLV to
        clearly describe EL, particularly in the scenario where label
        stack does not carry ELI (ex: FAT-PW <xref target="RFC6391"
        />). Therefore, this document defines a EL FEC to allow a
        Target FEC Stack sub-TLV to be added to the Target FEC Stack
        to account for EL.</t>
