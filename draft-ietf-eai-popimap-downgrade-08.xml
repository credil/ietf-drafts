  <abstract>
    <t>
	The Email Address Internationalization (SMTPUTF8) extension to SMTP allows
	UTF-8 characters in mail header fields.
	Upgraded POP and IMAP servers support internationalized Email messages.

	If a POP/IMAP client does not support Email Address Internationalization,
	POP/IMAP servers cannot deliver Internationalized Email Headers to the client
	and cannot remove the message.

	To avoid the situation,
	this document describes a conversion mechanism
	for internationalized Email messages to be in traditional message format.

	In the process, message elements
	requiring internationalized treatment are recoded or removed
        and receivers are able to know that they received messages containing such
	elements even if they cannot process the internationalized elements.

  <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
    <section title="Problem statement">
    <t>
	Traditional (legacy) mail systems, which are defined by <xref target="RFC5322" /> and other specifications,
	allow only ASCII characters in mail header field values.
	The SMTPUTF8 extension
		(<xref target="RFC6530" />,
		<xref target="RFC6531" /> and
		<xref target="RFC6532" />)
	allow raw UTF-8 in those mail header fields.
    </t>
    <t>
If a header field contains non-ASCII strings,
POP/IMAP servers cannot deliver Internationalized Email Headers to
legacy clients which does not send UTF8 command or UTF8 capability,
and because they have no obvious or standardized way to explain what
is going on to those clients, cannot even safely discard the message.
    </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Possible solutions">
      <t>
	There
        are four plausible approaches to the problem, with the preferred
        one depending on the particular circumstances and relationship
        among the delivery SMTP server, the mail store, the POP or IMAP
        server, and the users and their MUA clients:
        <list style="numbers">
           <t>If the delivery MTA has sufficient knowledge about the POP
                  and/or IMAP servers and clients being used, the message
                  may be rejected as undeliverable.</t>
           <t>The message may be downgraded by the POP or IMAP server, in a
              way that preserves maximum information at the expense of
              some complexity, and does not create security or operational
              problems in the mail system.
           </t>
           <t>Some intermediate downgrading may be applied that balances
                  more information loss against lower complexity and greater
                  ease of implementation.</t>
           <t>The POP or IMAP server may fabricate a message whose
                  intent is to notify the client that an internationalized
                  message is waiting but cannot be delivered until an
                  upgraded client is available.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Approach taken in this specification">
      <t> This specification describes the second of those options.  It
        is worth noticing that, at least in the general case, none of
        these options preserve sufficient information to guarantee that
        it is possible to reply to an incoming message without loss of
        information, so the choice may be considered to be among "least
        bad" options.
	While this document specifies a well designed mechanism,
        it is only an interim solution while clients are being upgraded
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-rfc5721bis" />
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-eai-5738bis" />.
     </t>
<t>This message downgrading mechanism converts mail header fields to an
all-ASCII representation.  The POP/IMAP servers can use the
downgrading mechanism and deliver the Internationalized Email message as
a traditional form.
Receivers can know they received some internationalized messages or some unknown or broken messages.
       </t>
    <t>
<xref target="RFC6532" />
allows UTF-8 characters to be used in
mail header fields and MIME header fields.
<xref target="RFC6531" />
allows UTF-8 characters to be used in
some trace header fields.
The message downgrading mechanism specified here describes 
	the conversion method
	from the internationalized messages that are defined in 
		<xref target="RFC6530" />, and
		<xref target="RFC6532" />
	to the traditional email messages
	defined in
		<xref target="RFC5322" />.
</t>
	<t>
	This document provides a precise definition of the
	minimum-information-loss message downgrading process.
 	</t>
	<t>
	Downgrading consists of the following three parts:
	<vspace blankLines="1" />
	<list style="symbols">
	<t>New header field definitions</t>
	<t>Email header field downgrading</t>
	<t>MIME header field downgrading</t>
	</list>
    </t>
    <t>
	Email header field downgrading is described in <xref target="HeaderDowngrading" />.
	It generates ASCII-only header fields.
    </t>
    <t>
	In <xref target="DowngradeEncap" /> of this document,
	header fields starting with "Downgraded-" are introduced.
	They preserve the information that appeared in the original
	header fields.
	</t>
    <t>
	The definition of MIME header fields in Internationalized Email Messages
	is described in <xref target="RFC6532" />.
	MIME header field downgrading is described in <xref target="MIMEheaderdowngrading" />.
	It generates ASCII-only MIME header fields.
    </t>
    <t>
	Displaying downgraded messages that originally contained
	internationalized header fields is out of scope of this
	document. A POP/IMAP client which does not support UTF8
	extensions as defined for POP3 [UTF8 command]
	and IMAP ["ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT" command]
	does not know internationalized message format
	described in <xref target="RFC6532" />.

	<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
	<t>
	The purpose of post-delivery message downgrading is to allow
	POP/IMAP servers to deliver internationalized messages
	to traditional POP/IMAP clients
	and permit the clients to display those messages.
	Users who receive such messages can know that they were
	internationalized.
	It does not permit receivers to read the messages in their
	original form and, in general, will not permit generating
	replies, at least without significant user intervention.
	</t>
	<t>
	A downgraded message's header fields contain ASCII characters only.
	But they still contain MIME-encapsulated header fields that contain
	non-ASCII strings. Furthermore, the body part may contain UTF-8 characters.
	Implementations parsing Internet messages need
	 to accept UTF-8 body parts and UTF-8 header fields that are MIME-encoded.
	Thus, this document inherits the security considerations of
	MIME-encoded header fields (<xref target="RFC2047" /> and
	<xref target="RFC3629" />).
	</t>
	<t>
	Rewriting header fields increases the opportunities for
	undetected spoofing by malicious senders.
	However, the rewritten header field values are
	preserved in equivalent MIME form
	or in newly defined header fields for which traditional MUAs have no special processing procedures.
	</t>
	<t>
	The techniques described here invalidate methods that depend
	on digital signatures over any part of the message,
	which includes the top-level header fields and body-part header fields.
	Depending on the specific message being downgraded, at least the
	following techniques are likely to break: DomainKeys Identified
	Mail (DKIM), and possibly S/MIME and Pretty Good Privacy (PGP).
	The downgrade
	mechanism SHOULD NOT remove signatures even if the signatures
	will fail validation after downgrading.  As much of the information as
	possible from the original message SHOULD be preserved.
	</t>
	<t>
   While information in any email header field should usually be treated with
   some suspicion, current email systems commonly employ various
   mechanisms and protocols to make the information more trustworthy.
   Information in the new Downgraded-* header fields is
   not inspected by traditional MUAs, and may be even less trustworthy
   than the traditional header fields.
   Note that the Downgraded-* header fields could have been inserted with malicious intent
   (and with content unrelated to the traditional header fields),
   however traditional MUAs do not parse Downgraded-* header fields.
	</t>
	<t>
In addition, if an Authentication-Results header
field <xref target="RFC5451" /> is present,
traditional MUAs may treat that the digital signatures are valid.

  <section title="Implementation Notes">
    <section title="RFC 2047 Encoding">
    <t>
  While <xref target="RFC2047" /> has a specific algorithm to deal with whitespace in
  adjacent encoded words, there are a number of deployed implementations
  that fail to implement the algorithm correctly.  As a result, whitespace
  behavior is somewhat unpredictable in practice when multiple encoded words
  are used.  While RFC 5322 states that implementations SHOULD limit lines
  to not more than 78 characters, implementations MAY choose to allow
  overly long encoded words in order to work around faulty <xref target="RFC2047" /> 
  implementations.  Implementations that choose to do so SHOULD have an
  optional mechanism to limit line length to 78 characters.

   <xref target="RFC5504" /> specified that no new header fields be registered that begin

   The "Downgraded-*" header fields that were registered as experimental
