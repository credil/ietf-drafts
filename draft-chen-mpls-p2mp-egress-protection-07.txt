Internet-Draft         P2MP LSP Egress Protection           October 2012


1.  Introduction

   RFC 4090 "Fast Reroute Extensions to RSVP-TE for LSP Tunnels"
   describes two methods for protecting P2P LSP tunnels or paths at
   local repair points.  The first method is a one-to-one protection
   method, where a detour backup P2P LSP for each protected P2P LSP is
   created at each potential point of local repair.  The second method
   is a facility bypass backup protection, where a bypass backup P2P LSP
   tunnel is created using MPLS label stacking to protect a potential
   failure point for a set of P2P LSP tunnels.  The bypass backup tunnel
   can protect a set of P2P LSPs having similar backup constraints.

   RFC 4875 "Extensions to RSVP-TE for P2MP TE LSPs" describes how to
   use the one-to-one protection method and facility bypass backup
   protection method to protect a link or intermediate node failure on
   the path of a P2MP LSP.  However, there is no mention of locally
   protecting any egress node failure in a protected P2MP LSP.

   An existing method for protecting the egress nodes of a P2MP LSP sets
   up a backup P2MP LSP from a backup ingress node to the backup egress
   nodes, where each egress node is paired with a backup egress node and
   protected by the backup egress node.  The backup P2MP LSP carries the
   same traffic as the P2MP LSP at the same time.  A traffic receiver
   from the P2MP LSP is normally connected to an egress node and its
   paired backup egress node.  It receives the traffic from the egress
   node in normal situations.

   The receiver selects the egress or backup egrss node for receiving
   the traffic according to the route to the source through RPF.  In a
   normal situation, it selects the egress node.  When the egress node
   fails, it selects the backup egress for receiving the traffic since
   the route to the source through the egress node is gone and the route
   to the source through the backup egress node is active.

   The main disadvantage of this method is that double network resources
   such as double bandwidths are used for protecting the egress nodes
   since the backup P2MP LSP consumes the same amount of network
   resource as the primary P2MP LSP.  The impact on network efficiency
   can be significant in case of large P2MP deployments.

   This document proposes a new method to locally protect the egress
   nodes of a P2MP LSP, which is called Egress Local Protection.  It
   specifies the mechanism and extensions to RSVP-TE for locally
   protecting an egress node of a Traffic Engineered (TE) point-to-
   multipoint (P2MP) Label Switched Path through using a backup P2MP sub
   LSP.  The new method overcomes the disadvantages described above.
   The same extensions and mechanism can also be used to protect the
   egress node of a TE P2P LSP.

4.  Mechanism

   This section briefly describes a solution that locally protects an
   egress node of a P2MP LSP through using a backup P2MP sub LSP.  We
   first show an example, and then present different parts of the
   solution, which includes the creation of the backup sub LSP, the
   forwarding state for the backup sub LSP, and the detection of a
   failure in the egress node.

4.1.  An Example of Egress Local Protection

   Figure 1 below illustrates an example of using backup sub LSPs to
   locally protect egress nodes of a P2MP LSP.  The P2MP LSP is from
   ingress node R1 to three egress nodes: L1, L2 and L3.  It is
   represented by double lines in the figure.

   La, Lb and Lc are the designated backup egress nodes for the egress
   nodes L1, L2 and L3 of the P2MP LSP respectively.  In order to
   distinguish an egress node (e.g., L1 in the figure) and a backup
   egress node (e.g., La in the figure), an egress node is called a
   primary egress node in the follwing description.

   The backup sub LSP used to protect the primary egress node L1 is from
   its previous hop node R3 to the backup egress node La.  The backup
   sub LSP used to protect the primary egress node L2 is from its
   previous hop node R5 to the backup egress node Lb.  The backup sub
   LSP used to protect the primary egress node L3 is from its previous
   hop node R5 to the backup egress node Lc via the intermediate node
   Rc.

   During normal operation, the traffic transported by the P2MP LSP is
   forwarded through R3 to L1, then delivered to its destination CE1.
   When the failure of L1 is detected, R3 forwards the traffic to the
   backup egress node La, which then delivers the traffic to its
   destination CE1.  The time for switching the traffic after L1 fails

   is within tens of milliseconds.

4.2.  Set up of Backup sub LSP

   A backup egress node is designated for a primary egress node of a
   LSP.  The previous hop node of the primary egress node sets up a
   backup sub LSP from itself to the backup egress node after receiving
   the information about the backup egress node.

   The previous hop node sets up the backup sub LSP, creates and
   maintains its state in the same way as of setting up a source to leaf
   (S2L) sub LSP from the signalling's point of view.  It constructs and
   sends a RSVP-TE PATH message along the path for the backup sub LSP,
   receives and processes a RSVP-TE RESV message that responses to the
   PATH message.

4.3.  Forwarding State for Backup sub LSP(s)

   The forwarding state for the backup sub LSP is different from that
   for a P2MP S2L sub LSP.  After receiving the RSVP-TE RESV message for
   the backup sub LSP, the previous hop node creates a forwarding entry

Internet-Draft         P2MP LSP Egress Protection           October 2012


   with an inactive state or flag called inactive forwarding entry.
   This inactive forwarding entry is not used to forward any data
   traffic during normal operations.  It SHALL only be used after the
   failure of the primary egress node.

   Upon detection of the primary egress node failure, the state or flag
   of the forwarding entry for the backup sub LSP is set to be active.
   Thus, the previous hop node of the primary egress node will forward
   the traffic to the backup egress node through the backup sub LSP,
   which then send the traffic to its destination.

4.4.  Detection of Egress Node Failure

   The previous hop node of the primary egress node SHALL detect the
   failures described below:

   o  The failure of the primary egress node (e.g.  L1 in Figure 1)

   o  The failure of the link between the primary egress node and its
      previous hop node (e.g. the link between R3 and L1 in Figure 1)

   o  The failure of the link between the primary egress node and its
      destination node (e.g. the failure of the link between L1 and CE1
      in Figure 1).

   Failure of the primary egress node and the link between itself and
   its previous hop node CAN be detected through a BFD session between
   itself and its previous hop node in MPLS networks.

   In the GMPLS networks where the control plane and data plane are
   physically separated, the detection and localization of failures in
   the physical layer can be achieved by introducing the link management
   protocol (LMP) or assisting by performance monitoring devices.

   Failure of the destination node and the link between the primary
   egress node and the destination node CAN be detected by a BFD session
   between the previous hop node and the destination node.

   Upon detecting any above mentioned failures, the previous hop node
   imports the traffic from the LSP into the backup sub LSP.  The
   traffic is then delivered to its destination through the backup
   egress node.


5.  Egress Local Protection with FRR

   RFC4875 "Extensions to RSVP-TE for P2MP TE LSPs" describes how to use
   RFC 4090 "Fast Reroute Extensions to RSVP-TE for LSP Tunnels" (FFR

Internet-Draft         P2MP LSP Egress Protection           October 2012


   for short) to locally protect failures in a link or intermediate node
   of a P2MP LSP.  However, there is not any standard that locally
   protects the egresses of the P2MP LSP.  The egress local protection
   mechanism proposed in this document fills this gap.  Thus, through
   using the egress local protection and the FRR, we can locally protect
   the egress nodes, all the links and the intermediate nodes of a P2MP
   LSP.  The traffic switchover time is within tens of milliseconds
   whenever any of the egresses, the links and the intermediate nodes of
   the P2MP LSP fails.

   All the egress nodes of the P2MP LSP can be locally protected through
   using the egress local protection.  All the links and the
   intermediate nodes of the LSP can be locally protected by using the
   FRR.  Note that the methods for locally protecting all the links and
   the intermediate nodes of a P2MP LSP are out of scope of this
   document.


6.  Representation of a Backup Sub LSP

   A backup sub LSP exists within the context of a P2MP LSP in a way
   similar to a S2L sub LSP.  It is identified by the P2MP LSP ID,
   Tunnel ID, and Extended Tunnel ID in the SESSION object, the tunnel
   sender address and LSP ID in the SENDER_TEMPLATE object, and the
   backup sub LSP destination address in the EGRESS_BACKUP_SUB_LSP
   object (to be defined in the section below).

   An EGRESS_BACKUP_SECONDARY_EXPLICIT_ROUTE Object (EB-SERO) is used to
   optionally specify the explicit route of a backup sub LSP that is
   from a previous hop node to a backup egress node.  The EB-SERO is
   defined in the following section.

6.1.  EGRESS_BACKUP_SUB_LSP Object

   An EGRESS_BACKUP_SUB_LSP object identifies a particular backup sub
   LSP belonging to the LSP.

6.1.1.  EGRESS_BACKUP_SUB_LSP IPv4 Object

   The class of the EGRESS_BACKUP_SUB_LSP IPv4 object is the same as
   that of the S2L_SUB_LSP IPv4 object defined in RFC 4875.  The C-Type
   of the object is a new number 3, or may be another number assigned by
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).

6.2.  EGRESS_BACKUP_SECONDARY_EXPLICIT_ROUTE Object

   The format of an EGRESS_BACKUP_SECONDARY_EXPLICIT_ROUTE (EB-SERO)
   object is defined as identical to that of the ERO.  The class of the
   EB-SERO is the same as that of the SERO defined in RFC 4873.  The EB-
   SERO uses a new C-Type 3, or may use another number assigned by
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  The formats of sub-
   objects in an EB-SERO are identical to those of sub-objects in an ERO
   defined in RFC 3209.


7.  Path Message

   This section describes extensions to the Path message defined in RFC
   4875.  The Path message is enhanced to transport the information
   about a backup egress node to the previous hop node of a primary
   egress node of a P2MP LSP through including an egress backup sub LSP
   descriptor list.

7.1.  Format of Path Message

   The format of the enhanced Path message is illustrated below.


      <Path Message> ::=  <Common Header> [ <INTEGRITY> ]
                          [ [<MESSAGE_ID_ACK> | <MESSAGE_ID_NACK>] ...]
                          [ <MESSAGE_ID> ]
                          <SESSION> <RSVP_HOP>
                          <TIME_VALUES>
                          [ <EXPLICIT_ROUTE> ]
                          <LABEL_REQUEST>
                          [ <PROTECTION> ]
                          [ <LABEL_SET> ... ]
                          [ <SESSION_ATTRIBUTE> ]
                          [ <NOTIFY_REQUEST> ]
                          [ <ADMIN_STATUS> ]
                          [ <POLICY_DATA> ... ]
                          <sender descriptor>
                          [<S2L sub-LSP descriptor list>]
                          [<egress backup sub LSP descriptor list>]


   The format of the egress backup sub LSP descriptor list in the
   enhanced Path message is defined as follows.

                          [ <EGRESS_BACKUP_SECONDARY_EXPLICIT_ROUTE> ]


7.2.  Processing of Path Message

   The ingress node of a LSP initiates a Path message with an egress
   backup sub LSP descriptor list for protecting primary egress nodes of
   the LSP.  In order to protect a primary egress node of the LSP, the
   ingress node MUST add an EGRESS_BACKUP_SUB_LSP object into the list.
   The object contains the information about the backup egress node to
   be used to protect the failure of the primary egress node.  An
   EGRESS_BACKUP_SECONDARY_EXPLICIT_ROUTE object (EB-SERO), which
   describes an explicit path to the backup egress node, SHALL follow
   the EGRESS_BACKUP_SUB_LSP.

7.2.1.  Backup LSP for One-to-One Protection

   If the previous hop node of the primary egress node receives the Path
   message with an egress backup sub LSP descriptor list and the request
   for protection via the one-to-one backup method, it generates a new
   Path message based on the information in the EGRESS_BACKUP_SUB_LSP
   (and according to EB-SERO if it exists) containing the backup egress
   node.

   The format of this new Path message is the same as that of the Path
   message defined in RFC 4875.  This new Path message is used to signal
   the segment of a special S2L sub-LSP from the previous hop node to
   the backup egress node.  The new Path message is sent to the next-hop
   node along the path for the backup sub LSP.

   If an intermediate node receives the Path message with an egress
   backup sub LSP descriptor list.  Then it MUST put the
   EGRESS_BACKUP_SUB_LSP (according to EB-SERO if exists) containing a
   backup egress into a Path message to be sent towards the backup
   egress.  This SHALL be done for each EGRESS_BACKUP_SUB_LSP containing
   a backup egress node in the list.

   When a primary egress node of the LSP receives the Path message with
   an egress backup sub LSP descriptor list, it SHOULD ignore the egress
   backup sub LSP descriptor list and generate a PathErr message.

7.2.2.  Backup LSP for Facility Protection

   The facility backup method will be used for locally protecting a
   primary egress node if the previous hop node of the primary egress
   node receives the Path message with an egress backup sub LSP
   descriptor list and the request for protection via the facility
   backup method.

   The previous hop node selects or creates a backup LSP tunnel from
   itself to the backup egress designated for protecting the primary
   egress.  If there exists a backup LSP tunnel from itself to the
   backup egress that satisifies the constraints given in the PATH
   message, then this tunnel is selected; otherwise, a new backup LSP
   tunnel to the backup egress will be created.

   After having a backup LSP tunnel, the previous hop node assigns the
   label allocated by the backup egress for the backup LSP as a top
   label (or called backup label).

   When the previous hop node detects a failure in the primary egress,
   it has to imports the traffic for the protected P2MP LSP into the
   backup bypass tunnel using the backup label as the top label.


8.  Processing of Resv Message

   The format of the Resv Message is not changed.  The processing of the
   Resv Message at the previous hop of a primary egress node is enhanced
   for reporting the status of the primary egress protection.

   The previous hop node of the primary egress node sets the protection
   flags in the RRO IPv4/IPv6 Sub-object for the primary egress node
   according to the status of the primary egress node and the backup sub
   LSP protecting the primary egress node.  For example, it will set the
   node protection bit to one indicating that the primary egress node is
   protected when the backup sub LSP to the backup egress node is set up
   for protecting the primary egress node.  It will set the bandwidth
   protection bit to one when the backup sub LSP guarantees to provide
   the desired bandwidth that is specified in the FAST_REROUTE object or
   the bandwidth of the protected LSP.
