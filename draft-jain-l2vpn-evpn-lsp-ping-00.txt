Abstract 

   LSP-Ping is a widely deployed Operation, Administration, and 
   Maintenance (OAM) mechanism in MPLS networks. This document 
   describes mechanisms for detecting data-plane failures using LSP
   Ping in MPLS based E-VPN and PBB-EVPN networks.

1. Introduction 

   [EVPN] describes MPLS based Ethernet VPN (E-VPN) technology. An E-
   VPN comprises CE(s) connected to PE(s). The PEs provide layer 2 E-
   VPN among the CE(s) over the MPLS core infrastructure. In E-VPN 
   networks, PEs advertise the MAC addresses learned from the locally 
   connected CE(s), along with MPLS Label, to remote PE(s) in the 
   control plane using multi-protocol BGP. E-VPN enables multi-homing 
   of CE(s) connected to multiple PEs and load balancing of traffic to 
   and from multi-homed CE(s).

   [PBBEVPN] describes the use of Provider Backbone Bridging [802.1ah] 
   with E-VPN. PBB-EVPN maintains the C-MAC learning in data plane and 
   only advertises Provider Backbone MAC (B-MAC) addresses in control 
   plane using BGP. 

   Procedures for simple and efficient mechanisms to detect data-plane 
   failures using LSP Ping in MPLS network are well defined in 
   [RFC4379][RFC6425]. This document defines procedures to detect data-
   plane failures using LSP Ping in MPLS networks deploying E-VPN and 
   PBB-EVPN. This draft defines 3 new Sub-TLVs for Target FEC Stack TLV 
   with the purpose of identifying the FEC on the Peer PE.

4. Proposed Target FEC Stack Sub-TLVs 

   This document introduces three new Target FEC Stack sub-TLVs that 
   are included in the LSP-Ping Echo Request packet sent for detecting 
   faults in data-plane connectivity in E-VPN and PBB-EVPN networks. 
   These Target FEC Stack sub-TLVs are described next.  

 

4.1. E-VPN MAC Sub-TLV 

   The E-VPN MAC sub-TLV is used to identify the MAC for an EVI under 
   test at a peer PE.  

   The E-VPN MAC sub-TLV fields are derived from the MAC advertisement 
   route defined in [EVPN] and has the format as shown in Figure 1. 
   This TLV is included in the Echo Request sent to the Peer PE by the 
   PE that is the originator of the request.

   The LSP Ping echo request is sent using the E-VPN MPLS label(s) 
   associated with the MAC route announced by a remote PE and the MPLS 
   transport label(s) to reach the remote PE. 

4.2. E-VPN Inclusive Multicast Sub-TLV 

   The E-VPN Inclusive Multicast sub-TLV fields are based on the E-VPN 
   Inclusive Multicast route defined in [EVPN].  

   The E-VPN Inclusive Multicast sub-TLV has the format as shown in 
   Figure 2. This TLV is included in the echo request sent to the E-VPN 
   peer PE by the originator of request to verify the multicast 
   connectivity state on the peer PE(s) in E-VPN and PBB-EVPN.

   Broadcast, multicast and unknown unicast traffic can be sent using 
   ingress replication or P2MP P-tree in E-VPN and PBB-EVPN network. In 
   case of ingress replication, the Echo Request is sent using a label 
   stack of <Transport label, Inclusive Multicast label> to each remote 
   PE participating in E-VPN or PBB-EVPN. The inclusive multicast label 
   is the downstream assigned label announced by the remote PE to which 
   the Echo Request is being sent. The Inclusive Multicast label is the 
   inner label in the MPLS label stack.  

   When using P2MP P-tree in E-VPN or PBB-EVPN, the Echo Request is 
   sent using P2MP P-tree transport label for inclusive P-tree 
   arrangement or using a label stack of <P2MP P-tree transport label,

   upstream assigned EVPN Inclusive Multicast label> for aggregate 
   inclusive P2MP P-tree arrangement as described in Section 5.  

   In case of E-VPN, an additional, E-VPN Auto-Discovery sub-TLV and 
   ESI MPLS label as the bottom label, may also be included in the Echo 
   Request as is described in Section 5.  

4.3. E-VPN Auto-Discovery Sub-TLV 

   The E-VPN Auto-Discovery (AD) sub-TLV fields are based on the 
   Ethernet AD route advertisement defined in [EVPN]. E-VPN AD sub-TLV 
   applies to only E-VPN.  

   The E-VPN AD sub-TLV has the format shown in Figure 3.

5.1. Unicast Data-plane connectivity checks 

  Figure 4 is an example of a PBB-EVPN network. CE1 is dual-homed to 
  PE1 and PE2. Assume, PE1 announced a MAC route with RD 1.1.1.1:00 and 
  B-MAC 00aa.00bb.00cc and with MPLS label 16001 for EVI 10. Similarly 
  PE2 announced a MAC route with RD 2.2.2.2:00 and B-MAC 00aa.00bb.00cc 
  and with MPLS label 16002.  

  On PE3, when a operator performs a connectivity check for the B-MAC 
  address 00aa.00bb.00cc on PE1, the operator initiates an LSP Ping

  request with the target FEC stack TLV containing E-VPN MAC sub-TLV in 
  the Echo Request packet. The Echo Request packet is sent with the 
  {Transport Label(s) to reach PE1 + E-VPN Label = 16001} MPLS label 
  stack. Once the echo request packet reaches PE1, it will process the 
  packet and perform checks for the E-VPN MAC sub-TLV present in the 
  Target FEC Stack TLV as described in Section 4.4 in [RFC4379] and 
  respond according to [RFC4379] processing rules.

                       Figure 4: PBB EVPN network 

  Similarly, on PE3, when an operator performs a connectivity check for 
  the B-MAC address 00aa.00bb.00cc on PE2, the operator initiates an 
  LSP Ping request with the target FEC stack TLV containing E-VPN MAC 
  sub-TLV in the echo request packet. The echo request packet is sent 
  with the {MPLS transport Label(s) to reach PE2 + E-VPN Label = 16002} 
  MPLS label stack. 

  LSP Ping operation for unicast data-plane connectivity checks in E-
  VPN, are similar to as described above for PBB-EVPN except that the 
  checks are for C-MACs and not for B-MACs.

   type set to ingress replication and downstream assigned inclusive 
   multicast MPLS label 17001. Similarly PE2 announced an Inclusive 
   Multicast route for EVI 10, with RD 2.2.2.2:00, Ethernet Tag (ISID 
   10), PMSI tunnel attribute Tunnel type set to ingress replication 
   and downstream assigned inclusive multicast MPLS label 17002.  

   Given CE1 is dual homed to PE1 and PE2, assume that PE1 is the DF 
   for ISID 10 for the port corresponding to the ESI 11aa.22bb.33cc. 
   44dd.5500.  

   When an operator at PE3 initiates a connectivity check for the 
   inclusive multicast on PE1, the operator initiates an LSP Ping 
   request with the target FEC stack TLV containing E-VPN Inclusive 
   Multicast sub-TLV in the Echo Request packet. The Echo Request 
   packet is sent with the {Transport Label(s) to reach PE1 + E-VPN 
   Incl. Multicast Label = 17001} MPLS label stack. Once the packet 
   reaches PE1, the packet will have E-VPN Inclusive multicast label. 
   PE1 will process the packet and perform checks for the E-VPN 
   Inclusive Multicast sub-TLV present in the Target FEC Stack TLV as 
   described in Section 4.4 in [RFC4379] and respond according to 
   [RFC4379] processing rules.  

   Operator at PE3, may similarly also initiate an LSP Ping to PE2 with 
   the target FEC stack TLV containing E-VPN Inclusive Multicast sub-
   TLV in the echo request packet. The echo request packet is sent with 
   the {transport Label(s) to reach PE2 + E-VPN Incl. Multicast Label = 
   17002} MPLS label stack. Since PE2 is not the DF for ISID 10 for the 
   port corresponding to the ESI value in the Inclusive Multicast sub-
   TLV in the Echo Request, PE2 will reply with special code indicating 
   that FEC exists on the router and the behavior is to drop the packet 
   because of not DF as described in Section 7.  

   In case of E-VPN, in the Echo Request packet, an Ethernet AD sub-TLV 
   and the associated MPLS Split Horizon Label at the bottom of the 
   MPLS label stack, may be added to emulate traffic coming from a MH 
   site, this label is used by leaf PE(s) attached to the same MH site 
   not to forward packets back to the MH site. If the behavior on a 
   leaf PE is to drop the packet because of Split Horizon filtering, 
   the PE2 will reply with special code indicating that FEC exists on 
   the router and the behavior is to drop the packet because of Split 
   Horizon Filtering as described in Section 7.

5.2.2.  Using P2MP P-tree 

  Both inclusive P-Tree and aggregate inclusive P-tree can be used in 
  E-VPN or PBB-EVPN networks.  

  When using an inclusive P-tree arrangement, p2mp p-tree transport 
  label itself is used to identify the L2 service associated with the 
  Inclusive Multicast Route, this L2 service could be a customer 
  Bridge, or a Provider Backbone Bridge. 

  For an Inclusive P-tree arrangement, when an operator performs a 
  connectivity check for the multicast L2 service, the operator 
  initiates an LSP Ping request with the target FEC stack TLV 
  containing E-VPN Inclusive Multicast sub-TLV in the echo request 
  packet. The echo request packet is sent with the {P2MP P-tree label} 
  MPLS label stack. 

  When using Aggregate Inclusive P-tree, a PE announces an upstream 
  assigned MPLS label along with the P-tree ID, in that case both the 
  p2mp p-tree MPLS transport label and the upstream MPLS label can be 
  used to identify the L2 service. 

  For an Aggregate Inclusive P-tree arrangement, when an operator 
  performs a connectivity check for the multicast L2 service, the 
  operator initiates an LSP Ping request with the target FEC stack TLV 
  containing E-VPN Inclusive Multicast sub-TLV in the echo request 
  packet. The echo request packet is sent with the {P2MP P-tree label + 
  E-VPN Upstream assigned Multicast Label} MPLS label stack. 

  The Leaf PE(s) of the p2mp tree will process the packet and perform 
  checks for the E-VPN Inclusive Multicast sub-TLV present in the 
  Target FEC Stack TLV as described in Section 4.4 in [RFC4379] and 
  respond according to [RFC4379] processing rules. A PE that is not 
  the DF for the EVI on the ESI in the Inclusive Multicast sub-TLV, 
  will reply with a special code indicating that FEC exists on the 
  router and the behavior is to drop the packet because of not DF as 
  described in Section 7.  

  In case of E-VPN, in the Echo Request packet, an Ethernet AD sub-TLV 
  and the associated MPLS Split Horizon Label at the bottom of the 
  MPLS label stack, may be added to emulate traffic coming from a MH 
  site, this label is used by leaf PE(s) attached to the same MH site 
  not to forward packets back to the MH site. If the behavior on a 
  leaf PE is to drop the packet because of Split Horizon filtering, 
  the PE2 will reply with special code indicating that FEC exists on 
  the router and the behavior is to drop the packet because of Split 
  Horizon Filtering as described in Section 7.

5.2.3. Controlling Echo Responses when using P2MP P-tree 

   The procedures described in [RFC6425] for preventing congestion of 
   Echo Responses (Echo Jitter TLV) and limiting the echo reply to a 
   single egress node (Node Address P2MP Responder Identifier TLV) can 
   be applied to LSP Ping in PBB EVPN and E-VPN when using P2MP P-
   trees for broadcast, multicast and unknown unicast traffic. 

   

5.3. E-VPN Aliasing Data-plane connectivity check 

   Assume PE1 announced an Ethernet Auto discovery Route with the ESI 
   set to CE1 system ID and MPLS label 19001, and PE2 an Ethernet Auto 
   discovery Route with the ESI set to CE1 system ID and MPLS label 
   19002. 

   When an operator performs at PE3 a connectivity check for the 
   aliasing aspect of the Ethernet AD route to PE1, the operator 
   initiates an LSP Ping request with the target FEC stack TLV 
   containing E-VPN Ethernet AD sub-TLV in the echo request packet. The 
   echo request packet is sent with the {Transport label(s) to reach 
   PE1 + E-VPN Ethernet AD Label 19001} MPLS label stack. 

   When PE1 receives the packet it will process the packet and perform 
   checks for the E-VPN Ethernet AD sub-TLV present in the Target FEC 
   Stack TLV as described in Section 4.4 in [RFC4379] and respond 
   according to [RFC4379] processing rules.  

6. Security Considerations 

  The proposal introduced in this document does not introduce any new 
  security considerations beyond that already apply to [EVPN], [PBBE
  VPN] and [RFC6425]. 
   
7. IANA Considerations 

   This document defines 3 new sub-TLV type to be included in Target 
   FEC Stack TLV (TLV Type 1) [RFC4379] in LSP Ping.  

   IANA is requested to assign a sub-TLV type value to the following 
   sub-TLV from the "Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label 
   Switched Paths (LSPs) Parameters - TLVs" registry, "TLVs and sub-
   TLVs" sub-registry:

   o   E-VPN MAC route sub-TLV.  

   o   E-VPN Inclusive Multicast route sub-TLV 

   o   E-VPN Auto-Discovery Route sub-TLV 

   Proposed new Return Codes 

   [RFC4379] defines values for the Return Code field of Echo Reply. 
   This document proposes two new Return Codes, which SHOULD be 
   included in the Echo Reply message by a PE in response to LSP Ping 
   Echo Request message: 

   1. The FEC exists on the PE and the behavior is to drop the packet 
      because of not DF.  

   2. The FEC exists on the PE and the behavior is to drop the packet 
      because of Split Horizon Filtering.
