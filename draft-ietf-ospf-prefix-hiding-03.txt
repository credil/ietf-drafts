Abstract

   A transit-only network is defined as a network connecting routers
   only.  In OSPF, transit-only networks are usually configured with
   routable IP addresses, which are advertised in Link State
   Advertisements (LSAs) but not needed for data traffic.  In addition,
   remote attacks can be launched against routers by sending packets to
   these transit-only networks.  This document presents a mechanism to
   hide transit-only networks to speed up network convergence and
   minimize remote attack vulnerability.

1. Introduction

   A transit-only network is defined as a network connecting routers
   only.  In OSPF, transit-only networks are usually configured with
   routable IP addresses, which are advertised in LSAs but not needed
   for data traffic.  In addition, remote attacks can be launched
   against routers by sending packets to these transit-only networks. 
   This document presents a mechanism to hide transit-only networks to
   speed up network convergence and minimize remote attack
   vulnerability.

   Hiding transit-only networks will not impact reachability to the end
   hosts.

2. Hiding IPv4 Transit-only Networks in OSPFv2

   In [OSPFv2], networks are classified as point-to-point, broadcast, or
   non-broadcast.  In the following sections, we will review how these
   OSPF networks are being advertised and discuss how to hide them
   consequently.


2.1. Point-to-Point Networks

   A point-to-point network joins a single pair of routers. Figure 1
   shows a point-to-point network connecting routers RT1 and RT2.

               Figure 1 Physical point-to-point network


2.1.1. Advertising Point-to-Point Networks

   For each numbered point-to-point network, a router has 2 link
   descriptions in its router-LSA, one Type 1 link (point-to-point)
   regarding the neighboring router, and one Type 3 link (stub)
   regarding the assigned IPv4 address.

   An example of router-LSA originated by RT1 would look like

      LS age = 0                        ;newly (re)originated
      LS type = 1                       ;router-LSA
      Link State ID = 1.1.1.1           ;RT1's Router ID
      Advertising Router = 1.1.1.1      ;RT1's Router ID
      #links = 2
         Link ID = 2.2.2.2              ;RT2's Router ID
         Link Data = 10.1.1.1           ;Interface IP address
         Type = 1                       ;connects to RT2
         Metric = 10

         Link ID= 10.1.1.0              ;IP network/subnet number
         Link Data = 255.255.255.252    ;Subnet's mask
         Type = 3                       ;Connects to stub network
         Metric = 10

   The Type 1 link will be used for SPF calculation while the Type 3
   link will be used for Routing Information Base (RIB) installation.


2.1.2. Hiding Point-to-Point Networks

   To hide a transit-only point-to-point network, the Type 3 link MUST
   be omitted from the router-LSA.

   An example of router-LSA originated by RT1, hiding the point-to-point
   network depicted in Figure 1, would look like

      LS age = 0                        ;newly (re)originated
      LS type = 1                       ;router-LSA
      Link State ID = 1.1.1.1           ;RT1's Router ID
      Advertising Router = 1.1.1.1      ;RT1's Router ID
      #links = 1
         Link ID = 2.2.2.2              ;RT2's Router ID
         Link Data = 10.1.1.1           ;Interface IP address
         Type = 1                       ;connects to RT2
         Metric = 10


2.2. Broadcast Networks

   A broadcast networks joins many (more than two) routers, and supports
   the capability to address a single physical message to all of the
   attached routers. Figure 2 shows a broadcast network connecting
   router RT3, RT4, and RT5.

2.2.1. Advertising Broadcast Networks

   For each broadcast network, a designated router (DR) describes it in
   its network-LSA. Assuming RT3 is elected as the DR in Figure 2, an
   example of the network-LSA originated by RT3 would look like

      LS age = 0                        ;newly (re)originated
      LS type = 2                       ;network-LSA
      Link State ID = 10.2.2.3          ;IP address of the DR (RT3)
      Advertising Router = 3.3.3.3      ;RT3's Router ID
      Network Mask = 255.255.255.0
         Attached Router = 3.3.3.3      ;Router ID
         Attached Router = 4.4.4.4      ;Router ID
         Attached Router = 5.5.5.5      ;Router ID

   OSPF obtains the IP network number from the combination of the Link
   State ID and the Network Mask.  In addition, the Link State ID is
   also being used for 2-way connectivity check.

2.2.2. Hiding Broadcast Networks

2.2.2.1. Sending Network-LSA

   To hide a transit-only broadcast network, a special network mask
   value 255.255.255.255 MUST be used in the network-LSA.  While a
   broadcast network connects more than routers, using 255.255.255.255
   will not hide an access broadcast network accidentally.

   As there is no change of the Link State ID, the 2-way connectivity
   check would proceed normally.

   An example of network-LSA originated by RT3, hiding the broadcast
   network depicted in Figure 2, would look like

      LS age = 0                        ;newly (re)originated
      LS type = 2                       ;network-LSA
      Link State ID = 10.2.2.3          ;IP address of the DR (RT3)
      Advertising Router = 3.3.3.3      ;RT3's Router ID
      Network Mask = 255.255.255.255    ;special subnet mask
         Attached Router = 3.3.3.3      ;Router ID
         Attached Router = 4.4.4.4      ;Router ID
         Attached Router = 5.5.5.5      ;Router ID

2.2.2.2. Receiving Network-LSA

   It's RECOMMENDED that all routers in an area be upgraded at the same
   time to process the modified network-LSA correctly and consistently. 

   When a router receives a network-LSA, it MUST check the 2-way
   connectivity as normal. However, if the network mask in the network-
   LSA is 255.255.255.255, the router MUST NOT install the route in the
   RIB.

2.2.2.2.1. Backward Compatibility
 


Yang, et al.            Expires November 2, 2012                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft    Hiding Transit-only Networks in OSPF       May 1, 2012


   When a not-yet-upgraded router receives a modified network-LSA, as
   specified in section 2.2.2.1, a host route to the originating DR will
   be installed.  This is not ideal but better than the current result,
   which exposes the whole subnet.

   In a partial deployment scenario, upgraded routers and not-yet-
   upgraded routers may coexist.  The former do not have the host routes
   aforementioned, while the latter do have.  Such inconsistencies
   create routing black holes, which should normally be avoided.  In
   this case, however, as packets destined for the transit-only networks
   are dropped somewhere in the network, the black holes actually help
   DRs defend from the remote attacks.

   In summary, the modification of the network-LSA, as specified in
   section 2.2.2.1, is backward compatible with the current
   specification of [OSPFv2], even in a partial deployment scenario.


2.3. Non-Broadcast Networks

   A non-broadcast networks joins many (more than two) routers, but does
   NOT support the capability to address a single physical message to
   all of the attached routers.  As mentioned in [OSPFv2], OSPF runs in
   one of two modes over non-broadcast networks: Non-Broadcast Multi-
   Access (NBMA) or Point-to-MultiPoint.

2.3.1. NBMA

   In NBMA mode, OSPF emulates operation over a broadcast network: a
   Designated Router is elected for the NBMA network, and the Designated
   Router originates an LSA for the network.

   To hide a NBMA transit-only network, OSPF adopts the same
   modification over the broadcast transit-only network, as defined in
   section 2.2.2.

2.3.2. Point-to-MultiPoint

   In point-to-MultiPoint mode, OSPF treats the non-broadcast network as
   a collection of point-to-point links.

   Figure 3 shows a non-broadcast network connecting router RT6, RT7,
   RT8, and RT9. In this network, all routers can communicate directly,
   except for routers RT7 and RT8.

2.3.2.1. Advertising Point-to-MultiPoint Networks

   For a point-to-multipoint network, a router has multiple link
   descriptions in its router-LSA, one Type 1 link (point-to-point) for
   EACH directly communicable router, and one Type 3 link (stub)
   advertising its interface IPv4 address with a subnet mask of
   255.255.255.255.

   An example of router-LSA originated by RT7 would look like

      LS age = 0                        ;newly (re)originated
      LS type = 1                       ;router-LSA
      Link State ID = 7.7.7.7           ;RT7's Router ID
      Advertising Router = 7.7.7.7      ;RT7's Router ID
      #links = 3
         Link ID = 6.6.6.6              ;RT6's Router ID
         Link Data = 10.3.3.7           ;Interface IP address
         Type = 1                       ;connects to RT6
         Metric = 10

         Link ID = 9.9.9.9              ;RT9's Router ID
         Link Data = 10.3.3.7           ;Interface IP address
         Type = 1                       ;connects to RT9
         Metric = 10

         Link ID= 10.3.3.7              ;Interface IP address
         Link Data = 255.255.255.255    ;Subnet's mask
         Type = 3                       ;Connects to stub network
         Metric = 0

2.3.2.2. Hiding Point-to-MultiPoint Networks

      To hide a transit-only point-to-multipoint network, the Type 3
      link MUST be omitted from the router-LSA.

3. Hiding IPv6 Transit-only Networks in OSPFv3

   In [OSPFv3], addressing semantics have been removed from the OSPF
   protocol packets and the main LSA types, leaving a network-protocol-
   independent core.  

   More specifically, router-LSAs and network-LSAs no longer contain
   network addresses, but simply express topology information.  Instead,
   two new LSA types, link-LSA and intra-area-prefix-LSA, have been
   introduced.  A link-LSA associates a list of IPv6 address to a link
   and has local-link flooding scope, and an intra-area-prefix-LSA
   either associates a list of IPv6 address with a router by referencing
   a router-LSA, or associates a list of IPv6 address with a
   broadcast/NBMA network by referencing a network-LSA. In the latter
   case, the prefixes in the link-LSAs from adjacent neighbors are
   copied into the intra-area-prefix-LSA by the Designated Router.

   To hide a transit-only network in [OSPFv3], the associated IPv6
   address prefixes MUST be omitted from the link-LSA. Consequently,
   when a Designated Router builds an intra-area-prefix-LSA referencing
   a network-LSA, these IPv6 address prefixes will be omitted.

   In addition, when a router builds an intra-area-prefix-LSA that is
   referencing a router-LSA, the associated IPv6 address prefixes of the
   transit-only network MUST also be omitted from the intra-area-prefix-
   LSA.


4. Hiding AF Enabled Transit-only Networks in OSPFv3

   [OSPF-AF] supports multiple Address Families (AFs) by mapping each AF
   to a separate Instance ID and OSPFv3 instance.  

   In the meantime, each prefix advertised in OSPFv3 has a prefix Length
   field [OSPFV3], which facilitates advertising prefixes of different
   lengths in different AFs.  The existing LSAs defined in OSPFv3 are
   used for prefix advertising and there is no need to define new LSAs.

   In other words, as link-LSAs and intra-area-prefix-LSAs are still
   being used, same method as explained in section 3 can be used to hide
   those AF enabled transit-only networks as well.


5. Forwarding Address

   Non-zero forwarding address can be advertised in As-external-LSAs and
   NSSA-LSAs to achieve optimal routing to AS external routes. The
   matching routing table entry of the forwarding address must exist to
   facilitate the SPF calculation.

   In other words, when prefix-hiding is configured on the next-hop
   interface, the next-hop interface address MUST NOT be used as
   forwarding address.

   Consequently, sub-optimal routing to these AS external routes may
   exist when prefix-hiding is configured.


6. Virtual Links

   Virtual links are used to connect physically separate components of
   the backbone. The virtual link's viability is determined by the
   existence of an intra-area path between two endpoints. The matching
   routing table entries of the endpoints must exist to ensure the
   virtual link's operation. 

   In other words, if prefix-hiding is configured on an interface, the
   virtual link endpoint MUST NOT use that interface's IP address as the
   virtual interface's IP address.


7. Operational Considerations

   By eliminating the ability to reach transit-only networks, the
   ability to manage these interfaces may be reduced.  In order to not
   reduce the functionality and capability of the overall network, it is
   recommended that extensions such as RFC5837 be also implemented.

8. Security Considerations

   One motivation for this document is to reduce remote attack
   vulnerability by hiding transit-only networks.  The result should
   then be that fewer OSPF core networks will be exposed to un-
   authorized access.

   While the steps described in this document are meant to be applied to
   transit-only networks ONLY, they could be used to hide other networks
   as well.  It is expected that the same care that users put on the
   configuration of other routing protocol parameters is used in the
   configuration of this extension.


9. IANA Considerations

   No actions are required from IANA as result of the publication of
   this document.
