  Load-balancing to Data Centers in a L3VPN environment based on Power

Abstract

   Data Centers may be spread across different locations for a
   particular enterprise. Different locations may mean within the same
   country but across different geographical locations, or outside the
   country even in a different continent. These data centers may be
   serving the enterprise or multiple enterprises / tenants wherein the
   regular enterprise site may request data from a data center site
   which could be one of the data center sites proximal to the
   enterprise site. Proximity is usually calculated based on a metric
   that is bandwidth driven or in terms with regard to the number of
   hops to reach that data center site hence bringing into play delay
   characteristics. Assume a topology where the data center sites and
   the enterprise sites are MPLS based L3VPN sites that are being
   provided connectivity through a Service Provider deploying Layer 3
   VPNs. Given such a topology it is possible that replication of data
   happens across the data centers in a timely manner to keep the data
   active and refreshed across all data center sites. Suitable
   mechanisms for such replication will come into play for this purpose.
   Thus any of the data centers can cater to the request from a user
   site.

   It is possible that power consumption in each data center may vary
   according to the load on each data center. It would be prudent to
   introduce a scheme where the power metric coupled with other metrics
   such as bandwidth and delay be used by a Provider Edge router in a
   L3VPN scenario to direct the packets or requests from regular user
   sites to such data centers with the least such metric. This is in
   line with the follow-the-moon strategy of directing requests for data
   and compute to data centers which are power-wise more efficient
   during the night or during the day. This draft document lays out one
   such proposal.

1  Introduction

   Data Centers may be spread across different locations for a
   particular enterprise. Different locations may mean within the same
   country but across different geographical locations, or outside the
   country even in a different continent. These data centers may be
   serving the enterprise or multiple enterprises / tenants wherein the
   regular enterprise site may request data from a data center site
   which could be one of the data center sites proximal to the
   enterprise site. Proximity is usually calculated based on a metric
   that is bandwidth driven or in terms with regard to the number of
   hops to reach that data center site hence bringing into play delay
   characteristics. Assume a topology where the data center sites and
   the enterprise sites are MPLS based L3VPN sites that are being
   provided connectivity through a Service Provider deploying Layer 3
   VPNs. Given such a topology it is possible that replication of data
   happens across the data centers in a timely manner to keep the data
   active and refreshed across all data center sites. Suitable
   mechanisms for such replication will come into play for this purpose.
   Thus any such data center site can cater to a request from a user
   site.

   It is possible that power consumption in each data center may vary
   according to the load on each data center. It would be prudent to
   introduce a scheme where the power metric coupled with other metrics
   such as bandwidth and delay be used by a Provider Edge router in a
   L3VPN scenario to direct the packets or requests from regular user
   sites to such data centers with the least such metric. This is in
   line with the follow-the-moon strategy of directing requests for data
   and compute to data centers which are power-wise more efficient
   during the night or during the day. This draft document lays out one
   such proposal.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.0 Reference Topology

   Assume the following topology where Data Center 1 and 2 are
   geographically dispersed within the county or across different
   continents and there is sufficient desirable properties of delay and
   bandwidth allocated to each of them. End User Sites depicted below
   the CEs would be enterprise sites that would request data and compute
   from these Data center sites. The DC GWs connecting the Data centers

   would play the role of CEs for the Data Centers. The PEs (1-5) are
   the Provider Edge routers of the ISP Core network that provide
   regular MPLS based L3VPN services for the inter-connection of the
   Data Center sites with the End User sites.

   During the normal course of events VPN instance labels would be
   exchanged between the PEs and the ISP core would provide LDP or RSVP
   based connectivity amongst these PEs. Thus a stack of labels with
   inner VPN instance label with the outer label being LDP or RSVP would
   be used to direct traffic from End User Sites to the Data Center
   sites and even amongst the End User Sites themselves. It is also
   possible that replication services would run between the Data Center
   sites as well using this mechanism.

2.1 Methodology of the new scheme

   When a site on the enterprise connected through a L3 VPN intends to
   access a data center, load-balancing mechanisms may use the nearest
   data center or that within the nearest country or even in another
   continent depending on the availability and load being serviced.  The
   method proposed in this document would advertise a power consumption
   rating along with a L3VPN service instance label for that Data Center
   site and the enterprise site PE accessing the Data Center may arrive
   at a decision as to which DC it is to access based on the power
   consumption rating so advertised in the MP-iBGP update. Trust level
   between Provider and customer is advised in this case.

   The PE devices would receive different VPN instance labels from each
   of the Data Centers using a MP-iBGP update with the compound power
   based metric in the attribute information in the update. Suitable
   extensions to extended community attributes would be done to
   facilitate the passage of such information. Assume Label 100 is sent
   from PE4 to the enterprise sites with Compound power metric 1200 and
   Label 200 is sent from the PE5 to the enterprise sites with Compound
   power metric 1400 at a certain point in time. 

   When the End User sites request a service from a data center, the PE
   (1-3) which have the labels 100 and 200 with their respective
   compound power metrices 1200 and 1400 respectively will choose which
   Data Center (1 or 2) has the least compound metric and direct the
   services towards that PE connected to the data center with that least
   power metric.

   In this case Data Center 1 has the least Compound power metric 1200
   and hence the traffic from say CE1 would be sent to Data Center 1.
   There is a periodic calculation of the compound power metric in each
   of the Data Center sites and this is exchanged with the PE through
   eBGP (say for example) between the respective CEs and the PEs. The
   VPN instance label used would be 100 to get to the Data Center 1 and
   the reachable PE would be set to PE4.

   Here the power metric is not discrete but in intervals of thresholds.
   Only the threshold interval is thus exchanged between the CEs and the
   PEs. This way dampening frequent fluctuations or oscillations within
   a given power metric interval is taken care of.

   Inter-DC connectivity and replication may also benefit from this
   scheme. DC A would choose to replicate with DC B at a time when the
   power consumption rating in both sites or in DC B is the lowest.

2.2 Calculation of the Compound Power Metric

   Factors such as compute load, cooling power consumption and network
   bandwidth within the Data Center would be used to compute the
   compound power metric within a Data Center to be advertised to the
   PEs within the Layer 3 VPN. The actual calculation is out of scope of
   this document and there exists sufficient literature to suggest a

   suitable method for such calculation. For now, this draft proposes a
   scheme for exchanging such power metrices and using them for load-
   balancing within a L3VPN scenario.

2.2.1 Power metric calculation for the DC as a whole and per tenant

   Many schemes exist for calculating the power consumed per tenant
   based on the occupancy of each tenant in a DC and for calculating the
   power consumed by the DC as a whole. Appropriate labels can be
   exchanged per tenant with the respective power metrices factored in
   per tenant if necessary. The specific end user site that is using the
   data and compute power of a data center may belong to a particular
   tenant and may wish to direct its traffic to the data center based on
   the power consumed for that specific tenant Identifier and hence use
   the appropriate label for the same in the PE. If the Data Center
   cater to a single tenant and are owned by the tenant then the overall
   power consumed by the DC will be used in the MP-iBGP update.

2.3 Extending the labeling scheme to the CE

   It is possible to extend the label imposition from the CE itself
   towards the ISP core in order to ensure that the CE can be made aware
   of such a scheme being available and use appropriate labels to
   indicate to the PEs that the CE requires power metric based load-
   balancing. Two different labels could be used by the CEs one for
   conventional methods of requesting services and the other the power
   metric based method where the PEs would consult the power metrices
   available and direct the request towards the low power consuming data
   center.

   If trust levels are not to be adhered to the label may be propogated
   along with the power consumption ratio to the CE and the CE would
   make the appropriate decision.

2.4 Extensions to MP-iBGP for this scheme.

   A future version of the draft will outline the actual extensions to
   the BGP protocol and its attributes with regard to how the compound
   power metric is carried in the actual BGP exchanges.

3  Security Considerations

   Trust levels between the Provider Edge and the customer edge should
   be proper in order that the Data Center's power metrices are
   exchanged between the PE and CE. eBGP as a PE-CE protocol could be
   adhered to for this purpose. Appropriate security mechanisms would
   have to be taken into account if the Data Center is serving multiple
   tenants. The computed Compound Power Metric may be calculated for
   each tenant and mechanisms should be adopted that one tenant's
   compound metric is not shared with other tenants. Appropriate label
   exchanges with each tenant's Label information and corresponding
   power metrices should be done with such separation in mind. If there
   is a collated power metric for all the tenants put together then the
   PE device should make sure that other Data Center provider's
   information is held separately in it's tables.


4  IANA Considerations

   Suitable IANA considerations for extending the BGP extended community
   attribute for accommodating the power metric information in the MP-
   iBGP update are to be taken into account. This will be made more
   clear in subsequent versions of the document.
