        PMIPv6 Multihoming Support Extensions for Flow Mobility
                  draft-sarikaya-netext-flowmob-ext-00

Abstract

   Base Proxy Mobile IPv6 multihoming support treats each active
   interface of the Mobile Node separately and creates a different
   binding cache entry for each interface.  This is similar to Mobile
   IPv6 restricting only one care-of address to be registered with the
   home agent and this restriction which did not allow flow mobility
   between interfaces has been removed by allowing multiple care-of
   address registration.  In this document we specify a similar solution
   for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) to support flow mobility among
   simultaneously connected interfaces.  Binding cache, binding update
   list and home network prefix option are slighlty extended to allow
   indicating the home interface and other interfaces.

Internet-Draft      PMIPv6 Support for Flow Mobility      September 2012


1.  Introduction

   Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) previously allowed registering only one care-of
   address called primary care-of address with the home agent of a
   Mobile Node (MN).  The underlying assumption was that only one
   interface would be activated at a given time.  This restriction has
   been removed by allowing multiple care-of addresses to be registered
   as in [RFC5648].

   RFC5648 makes the distinction among the interfaces of MN attached to
   the home link and all other interfaces attached to the visited
   link(s).  Home link has the home address and the visited links have
   care-of addresses.  A short value (16 bits) called Binding ID or BID
   is used to identify each care-of address.  MN sends Binding Update
   message with Binding Identifier Mobility Option to register these
   care-of addresses each assigned a unique BID.  HA creates separate
   binding cache entries connected to the home address for each distict
   BID representing an active interface of MN connected to a visited
   link.

   Mobile node uses its home address, i.e. the address of the interface
   attached to the home link as the source address and all incoming
   traffic is directed to the home address (HoA).  When multiple
   interfaces are concurrently active, the home agent (HA) has to decide
   how to route incoming packets to different active interfaces.  HA
   does this based on the flow bindings.  MN has to register in a BU its
   active flows with the HA using Flow Identification Mobility Option
   associating the flow with one or more registered BIDs HA keeps flow
   binding entries for each HoA.  HA then forwards packets to one of the
   care-of addresses of an active interface after matching it with an
   ordered list of flow bindings [RFC6089].

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] lacks a similar mechanism because each
   active interface is treated separately and a different binding cache
   entry is created.  This restriction is similar to MIPv6 not allowing
   to register more than one care-of addresses with the HA.  Handoff
   between two different interfaces is allowed in multihoming support of
   PMIPv6 as long as two different interfaces do not remain active
   simultaneously.

   This document proposes changes necessary to the local mobility anchor
   (LMA) and Mobility Access Gateway (MAG) behaviour so that flow
   mobility can seamlessly be supported in PMIPv6.  The changes to the
   mobile node are also needed to complement our solution on the host
   side [I-D.ietf-netext-logical-interface-support].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
   [RFC5213], [RFC6089] in addition to the ones specified in this
   section:

   Single-Radio MN:  Consider MN with two interfaces.  These interfaces
      are implemented in such a way that MN can keep one radio module
      (interface) active at a given time.
   Dual/multiple-Radio MN:  Consider MN with two interfaces.  These
      interfaces are implemented in such a way that both radio modules
      can receive and transmit simultaneously.

   This specification applies to multi-radio MNs.


3.  Problem Statement

   In base Proxy Mobile IPv6 when MN connects simultaneously with
   multiple interfaces each interface is treated independently and MN
   uses different source addresses when sending packets over these
   interfaces [RFC5213].

   In base Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] LMA treats each interface
   independently of the other interface(s) MN may have and tries to
   provide mobility support for each interface.  When LMA receives Proxy
   Binding Update (PBU) from a MAG it creates a new binding cache entry
   and allocates a new mobility session for this new interface.  In case
   of inter-technology handover, LMA does not create a new binding cache
   entry but it assigns the same home network prefix(es) to the new
   interface.  This binding cache entry represents the new interface and
   it replaces the previous interface.  Assigning the same HNPs enables
   IP session continuity between these two interfaces.

   LMA does not manage bindings from different interfaces of the mobile
   node in an integrated fashion because the assumption is that only one
   interface is active at a given time.  So LMA can not be in control of
   moving the flows between different interfaces.

   The solution to this is to modify the way the binding cache is
   managed.  Instead of creating an independent mobility session for
   each interface, the bindings from each simultaneously active
   interface are kept together so that the flows can be moved among
   interfaces.  The extensions to the base protocol needed for this



Sarikaya                 Expires March 28, 2013                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft      PMIPv6 Support for Flow Mobility      September 2012


   should be minimal.

   As in Mobile IPv6 [RFC5648], the distinction should be made of the
   interfaces connected to the home link or to the visited link(s).  In
   this specification we call them home and secondary links/ interfaces,
   respectively.  Binding Identifier or BID is not used.  BID is mainly
   defined for multiple-interfaced mobile nodes with Mobile IPv6
   functionalities.  The BID is an identification number used to
   distinguish multiple bindings registered by the mobile node.  Each
   BID is generated and managed by a mobile node in Mobile IPv6.  In
   Proxy Mobile IPv6, mobility management of mobile nodes with multiple
   interfaces is run in different independent MAGs, and BID loses its
   meaning.

   However in case of flow mobility, MN itself or LMA might wish to move
   one flow from one interface to the other.  When a flow is moved from
   interface A to interface B, MN has to stop sending packets on
   interface A, i.e. it should set the source address to an address
   based on HNPs assigned to interface B. Forcing an MN to do this after
   a flow is moved is difficult currently and is one of the problems
   PMIPv6 flow mobility is facing.

   The solution for this is to let MN always use a source address from
   HNPs assigned to its home interface.  When multiple interfaces are
   active, incoming packets can be directed to different active
   interfaces based on flow state established at LMA.


4.   Solution Overview

   When there is attachment over a new interface (HI value received in
   the Binding Update from MAG is 1) LMA creates a new binding cache
   entry and assigns the flag "S" defined in Section 5.1 to all home
   network prefixes assigned to this interface.  Also the corresponding
   value is set to the (H) flag of the home network interface option
   defined in Section 7 in the binding acknowledgement sent to MAG.  LMA
   MUST also include the home network prefixes with "H" flag in the BA
   message.  This should enable MN continue to send packets with source
   addresses selected from HNPs with "H" flag on.

   The new binding cache entry does not create a new mobility session.
   The entry is considered as a pointer to another binding the same MN
   has with LMA.  MN may have as many such binding entries as it has
   active interfaces.  These secondary binding cache entries are
   refreshed regularly by MAGs sending BUs.  MAG MUST include HNPs both
   with "H" and "S" flags in the BU message.  LMA refreshes the binding
   cache entry for the interface with only "S" flag.

5.  LMA Operation

   When LMA receives a Binding Update message which contains Handoff
   Indication set to a value of 1 LMA MUST create a new binding cache
   entry and assign new home network prefixes for this interface.  In
   the binding cache entry these HNPs MUST be flagged with a value of 0
   representing "S".  This binding cache entry becomes part of the
   binding cache entry that contains home network prefixes with "H"
   flag.  "H" and "S" flags are as defined in Section 5.1.

   LMA sends home network prefixes assigned to the new interface in the
   Binding Acknowledgement message.  LMA MUST also set the (H) Flag in
   HNP option to 0.  In the same BA message, LMA MAY also send home
   network prefixes whose (H) flag is set to 1 in the same BA.

   The modifications specified in this document allow a mobile node to
   have a single interface connected at a given moment and that
   interface has prefixes assigned an "S" flag, i.e. the binding with
   the home interface may have expired.  In this case LMA MUST also
   store the home network prefixes with "H" flag in the binding cache
   entry.

5.1.  Extensions to Binding Cache Entry

   One flag associated with the following binding cache entry: list of
   IPv6 home network prefixes assigned to the mobile node's connected
   interface and prefix length.  The flag is set to 1 representing "H"
   if the connected interface is the home interface and flag is set to 0
   representing "S" if the connected interface is not the home interface
   but it is one of the secondary interfaces.

   The prefixes assigned after the very first PBU is received for this
   MN are assigned the "H" flag.  The handoff between two different
   interfaces does not require the prefixes to be changed in order to
   allow session continuity.  Because of this the flag (of "H" or "S")
   associated with the prefixes stays the same.

   This specification also brings the change that binding cache entries
   for the same MN-Identifier are considered together.  The number of
   entries is equal to the number of active interfaces of MN.  If there
   is a single entry it is assumed that the flag value is "H", otherwise
   the prefixes with "H" flag should also be stored in the binding cache
   entry.

   For an incoming packet, the destination address MUST be selected from
   the set of prefixes with "H" flag, i.e.  MN always sends non-local
   packets with source address assigned from HNPs of its home interface.
   LMA decides to which interface to route this packet by consulting the

   flow mobility cache [I-D.ietf-netext-pmipv6-flowmob], similar to the
   case in Mobile IPv6 [RFC6089].  The packet will be matched against
   the flow descriptions [RFC6088] in the flow mobility cache and Proxy-
   CoA of the matching entry will be determined.  Next, binding cache
   entry for this MN will be searched and the packet will be directed to
   the MAG to which the matching interface is connected.


6.  MAG Operation

   When MAG detects an attachment over a new interface it sets Handoff
   Indicator field to 1 as described in [RFC5213] in the Binding Update
   message that it sends to LMA.

   MAG MUST store home network prefixes it receives in Binding
   Acknowledgement message from LMA together with the flag in the
   binding update list entry.  If the flag is "S" MAG MUST also store
   all home network prefixes in the BA message whose flag is "H" in the
   corresponding binding update list entry.  There will be a maximum of
   two sets of HNPs for each MN if the MAG is not connected to the home
   interface.

   MAG receives packets from LMA, decapsulates them and searches the
   binding update list to find the corresponding entry (with the "H"
   flag) and sends them to the MN with the corresponding "S" flag.

6.1.  Extensions to Binding Update List Entry Data Structure

   A flag associated with the following binding update list entry: list
   of IPv6 home network prefixes assigned to the mobile node's connected
   interface the corresponding prefix length.  The flag is set to 0
   representing "H" if the connected interface is the home interface and
   is set to 1 representing "S" if the connected interface is not.

   MAG MUST also store the home network prefixes with flag "H" in
   addition to the prefixes associated with the connected interface if
   the flag of the home network prefix assigned to the connected
   interface is "S".  MAG determines these flag values from the home
   network prefix option's (H) flag.

6.2.  MN Operation

   MN moves into PMIPv6 domain and gets connected to its home link.  MN
   roams in PMIPv6 domain as described in Section 7 of [RFC5213].

   When MN connects to a secondary link simultaneously with the home
   link MN MUST use a source address from HNPs assigned to its home link
   in its communication with the correspondent nodes.

7.  Message Formats

   Home Network Prefix Option defined in [RFC5213] is modified to
   include a flag to indicate if home network prefixes are associated
   with "H" flag or "S" flag in the binding cache entries.

   This specification extends the Home Network Prefix Option with a new
   flag.  The flag is shown and described below.  All other fields are
   as described in [RFC5213].

                   Figure 1: Home Network Prefix Option

   H Flag

      This flag is set to 1 when this prefix is assigned to a secondary
      interface of the mobile node, i.e. when the binding cache entry
      for this HNP has "S" flag set.  This flag is set to 0 when this
      prefix is assigned to the firstly connecting or the only connected
      interface of the mobile node, i.e. when the binding cache entry
      for this HNP has "H" flag set.


8.  Security Considerations

   This document does not define any new security issues.  PMIPv6
   security procedures apply.


9.  IANA considerations

   IANA is requested to add the H Flag into the reserved field in Home
   Network Prefix Option defined in Section 8.3 in [RFC5213] as the
   first bit, i.e.  Bit number 16 and change the Reserved (R) field as
   follows:

   This 7-bit field is unused for now.  The value MUST be initialized to
   0 by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.
