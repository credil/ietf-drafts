Abstract

   Under the current system of registration, separate requests are
   required to register entries for .well-known HTTP services, discovery
   via DNS mechanisms such as SRV and NAPTR and for a URI prefix.  This
   proposal encourages Web Services to adopt a consistent approach to
   configuration through a 'one stop' registration system whereby
   assignment of a .well-known identifier automatically assigns DNS and
   URI prefixes.
