          Problem Statement and Orthogonal control network for
         managing data-centers draft-gvenkat-sdn-dc-arch-arch-00


Abstract

   This draft describes a distributed Control Element for SDN
   implementations. This document describes various complexities
   associated with data-center management on adoption of new
   technologies in data center networking. While Server vitalization,
   cloud computing have very much increased the networking complexities
   while OpenFlow/SDN gives a different perspective which could provide
   solution.  Network virtualisation is next thing in happening.
   Traditional methods of managing each data-center element are
   increasing management complexities. The key to reduce the management
   complexity, and have automated infrastructure in very highly scaled
   data center network is to have orthogonal management and control
   network to the Data network. A distributed CE yet with a single
   manager orchestrating the networks will give much needed intelligence
   to OF controller.

1  Introduction

   One of the major challenges in large enterprises is managing their
   data centers. Evolving technologies had made managing more complex. 
   Following sections describes the problems and section 3 give a
   possible architecture that would reduce the complexity

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2  Problem definition

2.1  Server virtualization

   Server Virtualization provides an abstraction of all hardware
   resource that System image interface with. Various technologies has
   shaped the virtualization technology. Server virtualization allows
   multiple instances of various OS/SI run simultaneously on a physical
   server hardware. Hyper visor(VMM) is a software that enables multiple
   VM share the physical infrastructure with HW assist. Hyper visors
   implement Virtual Ethernet Bridges (VEB)/ virtual Switches.  Each VM
   contains at least one virtual NIC and which is associated with the
   physical NIC by VEB. This kind of a virtual switch raises two kinds
   of architectures.

   1. Ethernet switching functionality with in the physical server with
   following functionality of

         a VM to VM switching happens internally with in the VEB and 
             forwarding from VM and/or Hyper visor to adjacent 
             L2 switch.
         b. All of L2 functionality, VLAN. LAG/
         c. Differs from traditional switches by not forwarding traffic 
             from  adjacent L2 switch back to the adjacent switch 
             even through any other physical ports. Security policies
             implemented  in adjacent switches is not learned by the 
             virtual switch.
   The problem with this kind of architecture is  that the traffic
   between the two VMs reside with in the physical server and require
   additional control protocols for standard network  policies - e.g.,
   Security and QoS. [IEEE8021Qbg]. This standard also defines channels
   for segregation of traffic.

   2. The Hyper visor, instead of implementing its own virtual switch

INTERNET DRAFT     draft-gvenkat-sdn-dc-arch-arch-00        3, June 2012


   cooperatively work for switching traffic with the adjacent L2 switch.
          a. VM to VM switching happens through adjacent L2 switch 
          b. VM and / or Hyper-visor adjacent L2 switch
          c. All of L2 functionality, VLAN. LAG/
          d. Differs from traditional switches by not forwarding 
              traffic from adjacent L2 switch back to the adjacent  
              switch even through any other physical ports. Security  
              policies implemented in adjacent switches
             [IEEE8021BR, 8021Qay].


   The complexity in management of Networked VM requires more involved
   protocol exchange because of the blur in the demarcation of network
   and the computing resource. Really, a becoming of "Network is
   computer".

2.2 Cloud computing

   The goal of cloud computing is to enable IT organizations to achieve
   a dramatic improvement in the cost effective, elastic provisioning of
   IT services.  Cloud computing is Service or Infrastructure made
   available on and through Internet, on demand, which can scale on
   demand and migrate when there is a need[GAUTAM-SHROFF]. These
   features has transformed Cap-ex intensive Compute, network and
   Storage resources into cost effective utility services.

   These properties constraint the data center and imposes dynamic
   configuration changes on the data center as the infrastructure usage
   grows. Migrations need impose the address schema's to be retained.
   Dynamic bringing up and closing of App's, dynamic provisioning of
   storage and connecting, tearing or scaling of connections though WWW 
   makes configuration of NE in silos difficult. These requirement
   requires to data center be configured and managed as one single
   unified unit rather than the connected nodes of switches and nodes.
   Present architecture visualizes data center not as whole one unit but
   as component made out of individual switches, routers and servers.
   This requires configuration of individual elements and this results
   in the need of control protocols. Traditional method of configuration
   would require Complex checkpoint, commit or rollback methodologies
   for end-to-end provisioning in a data center.


2.3 SDN / OpenFlow

   The traditional network element, viz., switches and routers can be
   modularized to three major components based on the function they
   perform.

   ME - Management element. This module interact with management user
   for configuration data of the network resources. These data might
   under go changes due to control protocol rules and finally affects
   the Forwarding decision of FE.e.g., System Priority.

   CE- Control element,  These influence the forwarding decisions of FE.
   The major function are Neighbor discovery, Topology discovery, QoS
   parameter negotiations and Flow control, etc. These traffic are not
   use data but results of the algorithmic computation of these protocol
   data facilitate the user data communication.   Each NE has a CE which
   generate control traffic. Each CE talk to the rest of the CEs or
   directly connected CE through various protocols for arriving in
   control data. 

   FE - Forwarding element. Based on the configuration and control
   element learning, this element chooses the best path to forward the
   traffic for the packet to reach the destination.

   ForCES framework [RFC3656]  and  OpenFlow standards provides clear
   separation of Forwarding (FE) and Controlling (CE) entities allowing
   them to reside in different compute nodes in a network. This
   separation resulted in definition of protocols [RFC5810], [OPENFLOW] 
   to configure forwarding tables in the Network element. But still
   these advances does not allow the to be seen as a single unit for
   provisioning.

   OpenFlow defines (1) OpenFlow channel which carries the OpenFlow
   protocol messages, (2) OpenFlow switch which implements the Flow
   Tables and Action lists and (3) the controller. The OpenFlow channel
   is independent and orthogonal to the Data network and is used to
   configure the data flows. Since its is separate from the data
   network, controller is devoid of the dynamics of the data network and
   inhibits it in from dynamic control. 

2.5 Flattening of DC networks.

   A three-tier network architecture is the dominant structure in as the
   standard design for DCs.  The three tiers are access, Aggregation and
   Core layers in the hierarchy. Access switches Top-of-Rack (ToR)
   switches, or modular/End-of-Row (EoR) switches that connect servers
   and IP/Ethernet based storage to aggregation switches. Traditionally,
   DC are designed for higher North-South (client - server) traffic.
   Virtualization disrupts these assumptions and requires the network be
   flat. [ 

2.4 Network Virtualization

   After Storage and  Compute resource (server) virtualization, the need

   for virtualizing of network is being felt[INET-VIR]. Though VLANS and
   tunnels could be considers as virtual networks, the dynamics and
   scale data-centers impose, requires fresh thinking[OVERLAY1,
   OVERLAY2].

3 Unified data center architecture

   Blade based unified "data-center in a box" solutions are available in
   the market as off-the-rack products, but for the system integrators
   who  wish of build, there seems to be lack of standards to unify the
   three essentials of data-center, storage. network and compute. These 
   three does not reside alone in data-center, usually requiring these
   three resources or at-the-least two of them. 

   This document proposes an independent management and control network
   which would be orthogonal to the data network. This type of
   orthogonal network separate for control and configuration of  data
   network is not new. TMN architecture in Telecommunication network is
   a similar kind of architecture. [TMN]

   The Control and Management Network (CMNw)  is independent and
   orthogonal  to the data traffic. It would specifically carry the
   control, management traffic and  OF Messages. This would be a
   carefully laid loop free, non Hierarchical would be in a private
   address space. The management of individual NEs must happen through
   SNMP/ NETCONF or standard CLI from centralized management module.
   Provisioning of Server, network and Storage happen from centralized
   manager application.

   Control Plane functions that are that are processed  in
   switches/routers at superficially
      1. Topology discovery
      2. Event or notification of a state change to peer at the layer 
          of operation.

   Some of the functions of present CE functions would become a non-
   requirement by this control and management work. And Path/Topology

   globally available.

   Path discovery is step process usually implemented as state machines,
   involving port or link states or elections bases on priorities
   assigned. Briefly, the present implementations work the following
   way.
      1. Exchange of protocol message between peer  ports  with 
          priorities, cost, etc identification, re computation 
          notification  and confirming changes

      2. Algorithmic computation of best paths, distribution trees.
           For example, each node its own view of shortest paths 

      3. Program the FE's Forwarding tables, based on step 2.

   In unified framework, 
      1. Link existence. Since port or node failure would be available 
          through Control Network, the protocol exchange would be less 
          intense.

      2. Algorithmic computation of best paths for all pairs of 
          vertices [CORMEN, FLOYD]

      3. Program all FE's Forwarding tables, based on step 2, which
          would be OF messages. For L2 this would be distribution trees 
          for which protocols needs to be specified.

   The traditional network element, viz., switches and routers can be
   modularized to three major components based on the function they
   perform.
