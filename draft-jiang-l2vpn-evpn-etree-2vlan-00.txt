Abstract

   This document discusses how the Dual-VLAN approach as described in
   [Etree-vlan] can be used to support the transport of E-Tree service
   in E-VPN. Thus a single convergent solution is possible for both VPLS
   and E-VPN.

1. Introduction

   The E-Tree service is defined in Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) as a
   Rooted-Multipoint EVC service. It is a multipoint Ethernet service
   with special restrictions: the frames from a root may be received by
   any other root or leaf, and the frames from a leaf may be received by
   any root, but MUST not be received by a leaf. Further, an E-Tree
   service may include multiple roots and multiple leaves.

   [Etree-req] gives the requirements for providing E-Tree solutions in
   the VPLS and the need to filter leaf-to-leaf traffic.

   Section 10 of [EVPN-req] discusses the requirements of providing the
   ability to support hub and spoke (i.e., root and leaf) in E-VPN.

   [EVPN-etree] proposed to use another layer of MPLS label to indicate
   the E-Tree attributes of the port whereupon the packet is received.

   This document discusses how the Dual-VLAN approach as described in
   [Etree-vlan] can be used to support the transport of E-Tree service

   in E-VPN. Thus a single convergent solution can be used for both VPLS
   and E-VPN, and hopefully save the work in implementation.



2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].



3. Terminology

   E-Tree: a Rooted-Multipoint EVC service as defined in MEF 6.1

   EVC: Ethernet Virtual Connection, as defined in MEF 4.0

   Root VLAN, a VLAN ID used to indicate all the frames that are
   originated at a root AC

   Leaf VLAN, a VLAN ID used to indicate all the frames that are
   originated at a leaf AC

4. E-Tree Support with 2VLAN in E-VPN

   The same E-Tree extended community as proposed in [Etree-vlan] can be
   used for E-Tree signaling in E-VPN (copied here for convenience):

                   +------------------------------------+
                   | Extended community type (2 octets) |
                   +------------------------------------+
                   |  Root VLAN (2 octets)              |
                   +------------------------------------+
                   |  Leaf VLAN (2 octets)              |
                   +------------------------------------+
                   |  Reserved                        |P|
                   +------------------------------------+

Internet-Draft   E-Tree Support with 2VLAN in E-VPN     September 2012


   o Leaf VLAN ID is the value of the local leaf VLAN.

   o Reserved, 15 bits MUST be set to zero on transmit and be ignored
      on receive.

   o P is a Leaf-only bit, it is set to 1 to indicate that the PE is
      attached with only leaf nodes, and set to 0 otherwise.

   The PEs attached with root and/or leaf node(s) must support BGP E-
   Tree signaling as described in [Etree-vlan], and must be capable of
   VLAN mapping in their data planes.

   In E-VPN signaling for E-Tree, the E-Tree extended community SHOULD
   be further attached to the following E-VPN Route types:

      - MAC Advertisement Routes

      - Ethernet A-D Routes

      - Inclusive Multicast Routes

   For Point-to-Point connectivity, or for Point-to-MultiPoint
   connectivity when ingress replication is used, since the ESI MPLS
   label is a downstream assigned MPLS label, the same E-Tree signaling
   as specified for BGP VPLS SHOULD be used. Furthermore, a PE that
   receives a BGP UPDATE message attached with an E-Tree Extended
   Community from its peer PE MUST process it as specified in Section 7
   of [Etree-vlan] (after processing procedures as specified in [EVPN]).

   For Point-to-MultiPoint connectivity when a P2MP or MP2MP LSP tunnel
   as described in [EVPN] is used, since the ESI MPLS label is an
   upstream assigned MPLS label, the ingress PEs in the P2MP LSP or
   MP2MP LSP MUST set VLAN-Mapping-Mode to FALSE, and the egress PEs
   MUST set VLAN-Mapping-Mode to TRUE if global VLANs are not
   provisioned for the E-Tree. In E-Tree signaling, the E-Tree extended
   community SHOULD only be used to notify which root and leaf VLANs are
   used in each PE.

   When an E-Tree frame arrives at a PE, a root VLAN or a leaf VLAN tag
   is added according to the attribute (root or leaf) of the AC upon
   which it is received. E-VPN data plane processing for the frame is
   the same as described in [EVPN], and E-Tree data plane processing as
   described at the end of Section 6 of [Etree-vlan] can be applied
   further.

5. OAM Considerations

   VPLS OAM requirements and framework as specified in [RFC6136] are
   applicable to E-VPN, as both Ethernet OAM frames and data traffic are
   transported over the same path.

   Ethernet OAM for E-Tree including both service OAM and segment OAM
   frames shall undergo the same VLAN mapping as the E-VPN data traffic;
   and root VLAN SHOULD be applied to segment OAM frames so that they
   are not filtered.

6. Applicability

   The solution is applicable to E-VPN as specified in [EVPN].

7. Security Considerations

   This solution prevents leaf to leaf communication in the data plane
   of E-VPN even when its PEs are fully interconnected. In this regard,
   security can be enhanced for customers with this solution.

8. IANA Considerations

   Nothing special is needed for IANA consideration except those already
   defined in [EVPN] and [Etree-VLAN].
