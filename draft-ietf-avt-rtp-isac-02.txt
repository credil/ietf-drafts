Internet-Draft                    iSAC                      October 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document gives a general description of the iSAC wideband speech
   codec and specifies the iSAC payload format for usage in RTP packets.
   Also included here are the necessary details for the use of iSAC with
   the Session Description Protocol (SDP).


2.  iSAC Codec Description

   The iSAC codec is an adaptive wideband/superwideband speech and audio
   codec that operates with short delay, making it suitable for high
   quality real time communication.  It is specially designed to deliver
   wideband speech quality in both low and medium bit rate applications.
   It also handles non-speech audio well, such as music and background
   noise [5].

   The iSAC codec compresses speech frames of 16 kHz, 16-bit sampled
   input speech, each frame containing 30 or 60 ms of speech.  It also
   has a superwideband mode which allows a 32 kHz sampling rate.  In
   super-wideband mode the input signal is split into wideband (0-8 kHz)
   and upper (8-16 kHz) signal.  Each sub-band is encoded independently,
   and their associated payloads concatenated, c.f.  Figure 2, to
   construct the overall iSAC super-wideband RTP payload.  Note that the
   same encoder/decoder is used for the wideband part for both wideband
   and super-wideband modes.

   The codec runs in one of two different modes called channel-adaptive
   mode and channel-independent mode.  In both modes iSAC is aiming at a
   target bit rate, which is neither the average nor the maximum bit
   rate that will be reach by iSAC, but corresponds to the average bit
   rate during peaks in speech activity.  The bit rate will sometimes
   exceed the target bit rate, but most of the time will be below.  The
   average bit rate obtained is on average about a factor of 1.2 times
   lower than the target bit rate on continuous speech, and will be
   lower on speech with pauses.

   In channel-adaptive mode the target bit rate is adapted to give a bit
   rate corresponding to the available bandwidth on the channel.  The
   available bandwidth is continuously estimated at the receiving iSAC
   and signaled in-band in the iSAC bit stream.  Even at dial-up modem
   data rates (including IP, UDP, and RTP overhead) iSAC delivers high
   quality by automatically adjusting transmission rates to give the
   best possible listening experience over the available bandwidth.  The
   default initial target bit rate is 20000 bits per second in channel-
   adaptive mode.

   In channel-independent mode a target bit rate has to be provided to

Internet-Draft                    iSAC                      October 2012


   iSAC prior to encoding; the target bit rate can be changed over the
   time of the call.

   After encoding the speech signal the iSAC coder uses lossless coding
   to further reduce the size of each packet, and hence the total bit
   rate used.

   The adaptation and the lossless coding described above both result in
   a variation of packet size, depending both of the nature of speech
   and the available bandwidth.  Therefore, the iSAC codec, in wideband
   mode, operates at transmission rates from about 10 kbps to about 32
   kbps.  In super-wideband mode, the transmission rate is in the range
   of 10 kbps to 56 kbps.  If operating in super-wideband mode, the iSAC
   codec automatically adjusts the effective encoded audio bandwidth for
   the best experience.

   Bit Rate  | 10 - 32  |  32 - 38   | 38 - 45 | 45 - 50    | 50 - 56
    [kbps]   |          |            |         |            |
   ----------+----------+------------+----------------------+---------
   Effective |          |  0 - 8     | 0 - 12  | 0 - 12     | 0 - 16
   Bandwidth | 0 - 8 kHz| operating  |         | operating  |
    [kHz]    |          | at 32 kbps |         | at 45 kbps |


   The main characteristics can be summarized as follows:

   o  Wideband or superwideband, 16 kHz or 32 kHz respectively, speech
      and audio codec

   o  Variable bit rate, which depends on the input signal

   o  Adaptive rate with two modes: channel-adaptive or channel-
      independent mode

   o  Bit rate range from around 10 kbps to 32 kbps when operating on
      wideband input.  For input audio sampled at 32 kHz, the bit rate
      range 10 kbps to 56 kbps.

   o  Operates on 30 or 60 ms of speech for wideband inputs, and only 30
      ms for super-wideband inputs.

   o  In super-wideband mode, depending on the target bit rate, the
      effective bandwidth is adjusted for the optimal experience.

3.  RTP Payload Format

   The iSAC codec in wideband mode uses a sampling rate clock of 16 kHz,
   so the RTP timestamp MUST be in units of 1/16000 of a second.  In
   super-wideband mode, the iSAC codec uses a sampling rate clock of 32
   kHz, so the RTP timestamp MUST be in units of 1/32000 of a second.

   The RTP payload for iSAC has the format shown in Figure 1.  No
   additional header fields specific to this payload format are
   required.  For RTP based transportation of iSAC encoded audio, the
   standard RTP header [2] is followed by one payload data block.

3.1.  iSAC Wideband Payload Format

   The iSAC payload block consists of a payload header and one or two
   encoded 30 ms speech frames.  The iSAC payload is generated in the
   following manner:

   o  Parameters representing one or two 30 ms frames of speech data are
      determined by the encoder.  The parameters are quantized to
      generate encoded data corresponding to the one or two speech
      frames.  The length of the encoded data is variable and depends on
      the signal characteristics and the target bit rate.

   o  The payload header is generated (described in Section 3.2) and
      added before the encoded parameter data for the speech frame(s).

   o  Lossless coding is applied to the complete iSAC payload block,
      including payload header, to generate a compressed payload.  The
      length depends on the length of the data generated to represent
      the speech and the effectiveness of the lossless coding.

   No part of the payload header or the encoded speech data can be
   retrieved without partly or fully decoding the packet.

   The following figure shows an iSAC payload block containing 60 ms of
   encoded speech data.

3.2.  Payload Header

   The payload header holds information for the receiver about the
   available bandwidth, in the form of a Bandwidth Estimation Index
   (BEI), and the length of the speech data in the current payload
   (frame length, FL).  The header has the format defined in Figure 3.
   Note that the size of the header can vary due to the lossless
   encoding described in section 2 and in section 3.1.  Also note that
   the BEI is always estimated and transmitted, even if iSAC runs in
   channel-independent mode.

   o  BEI: Bandwidth Estimation Index.  The bandwidth estimate is
      quantized into one out of 24 values.  Valid values are 0 to 23.

   o  FL: The length of the speech data (Frame Length) present in the
      payload, given in number of speech samples.  Valid frame lengths
      are 480 (30 ms) and 960 (60 ms) samples.

3.3.  Encoded Speech Data

   The iSAC encoded speech data consist of parameters representing one
   or two frames of 30 ms speech.  The length of the speech data is
   signaled in the header (in number of samples), and the length may
   change at any time during a session.  In channel-adaptive mode the
   length is changed to best utilize the available bandwidth, and extra
   padding is added to some packets as a bandwidth probe.

   The iSAC payload is padded to whole octets, and has a variable length
   depending on the input source signal, number of 30 ms speech frames,
   and target bit rate.

   The number of octets used to describe one frame of 30 ms speech
   typically varies from around 50 to around 120 octets.  For the case
   of 60 ms speech (two 30 ms speech frames), the number of octets
   varies from around 100 to around 240 octets.  The absolute maximum
   allowed payload length is 400 octets.  The user can choose to lower
   the maximum allowed payload length.  Minimum value is 100 octets.  It

Internet-Draft                    iSAC                      October 2012


   is possible for the user to choose a maximum bit rate (averaged over
   a frame) instead of a maximum payload length.  The maximum payload
   length is then dependent on the length of the speech data represented
   in the payload (30 or 60 ms).  Possible maximum rates are in the
   range of 32000 to 53400 bits per second.

   The sensitivity to bit errors is equal for all bits in the payload.

3.4.  iSAC Superwideband Payload Format

   In super-wideband mode, payloads associated with each sub-band
   (wideband 0-8 kHz and upper-band 8-16 kHz) are constructed
   independently and concatenated as depicted in Figure 2.  Note that in
   super-wideband mode only one 30 ms frame is encoded in each payload.

   +--------------------------------+---+------------------------+-----+
   | Payload +30 ms Encoded wideband|LEN|30 ms Encoded upper-band| CRC |
   | Header   speech data           |   |speech data             |check|
   +--------------------------------+---+------------------------+-----+
                                        |<--- CRC checked data ->|

   Figure 4: Super-Wideband payload format

   Payloads of wideband and upper-band are encoded independently,
   allowing the encoder to simply concatenate two payloads to construct
   one iSAC super-wideband payload.  The RTP payload of the iSAC super-
   wideband codec starts with the payload of the wideband part, which is
   padded to whole octets, followed by one byte (LEN in Figure 4)
   representing the length of the remaining sequence, payload of the
   upper-band plus 4 bytes for CRC sequence.

   If LEN_UB denotes the length of the upper-band payload, then LEN = 1
   + LEN_UB + 4.  This value should not exceed 255, otherwise upper-band
   payload is omitted.

   The CRC check is added to distinguish between upper-band payload and
   random bit-stream padding that can be added for probing available
   network bandwidth.

   At the receive side, a super-wideband payload is first given to the
   wideband decoder.  The wideband decoder decodes as many parameters as
   required to uniquely reproduce the encoded wideband audio.  The next
   byte in the payload should hold the value of LEN.  This provides a
   sanity check that the decoding process has not failed.  Thereafter,
   the receiver runs a CRC check over the upper-band payload and
   compares the results with the last 4 bytes in the packet.

   If the computed CRC and the last four bytes of the payload don't

Internet-Draft                    iSAC                      October 2012


   match, the remaining bits are assumed to be added for probing the
   network.  Hence, the upper-band signal is replaced by zeros and
   combined with the wideband signal to generate the super-wideband
   signal.

   If the two CRCs match, then the upper-band payload is given to the
   upper-band decoder.  Thereby, the output of the upper-band decoder is
   combined with the wide-band decoded audio to generate the super-
   wideband signal.

   It might be that for a given packet, the wideband decoder uses all
   the given payload.  This can be the case when a super-wideband
   encoder is operating at low rates and has adjusted the effective
   bandwidth to wideband.  In this case, the decoder inserts zeros as
   the reconstructed upper-band and combines both bands to reproduce the
   super-wideband signal.

3.5.  Encoded Upper-band Speech Data

   The iSAC encoded upper-band speech data consists of parameters
   representing one frame of 30 ms speech.  Depending on the target rate
   the upper-band encoder might choose to only encode the sub-band of 8
   kHz to 12 kHz.  This is signaled inband to the receiver.

3.6.  Padding

   Padding, which consists of randomly generated bits, may be added at
   the end of the payload in both wideband and superwideband modes.  It
   can be used by the sender for bandwidth probing, and is always
   ignored by the receiver.

   In wideband mode, padding simply follows the payload, preceded by a
   length field.

   | Wideband |LEN|Padding |

   Figure 5: Wideband payload format with padding.

   LEN is the length of the padding in bytes + 1: LEN = LEN_PAD + 1

   In superwideband mode, the format of a packet with padding looks like
   the following.

   Figure 6: Super-Wideband payload format

   LEN is 1 + LEN_UB + 1 + LEN_PAD + 4, where LEN_UB is the length of
   the upper-band speech data in bytes, and LEN_PAD is the length of the
   padding in bytes.

   L2 is LEN_PAD + 1.

   The CRC check runs over the upper-band speech data, L2 and the
   padding.

3.7.  Multiple iSAC frames in an RTP packet

   More than one iSAC payload block MUST NOT be included in an RTP
   packet by a sender.

   Further, iSAC payload blocks MUST NOT be split between RTP packets.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines the iSAC media type, and requests IANA to
   register it.



   Media type name:   audio

   Media subtype:   isac

   Required parameters:  None

   Optional parameters:

      *  ibitrate: The parameter indicates the upper bound of the
         initial target bit rate the device would like to receive.  For
         channel-adaptive mode, the target bit rate may vary with time;
         for channel-independent mode, the target bit rate will remain
         at that level unless instructed otherwise.  An acceptable value
         for ibitrate is in the range of 20000 to 32000 (bits per
         second).

      *  maxbitrate: The parameter indicates the maximum bit rate the
         endpoint expects to receive.  The recipient of this parameter
         SHOULD NOT transmit at a higher bit rate.

   Encoding considerations:
      This media format is framed and binary.

   Security considerations:  See Section 6

   Interoperability considerations:  None

   Published specification:  RFC XXXX

   Applications which use this media type:
      This media type is suitable for use in numerous applications
      needing to transport encoded voice or other audio.  Some examples
      include Voice over IP, Streaming Media, Voice Messaging, and
      Conferencing.

   Additional information:  None

   Intended usage:  COMMON

   Other Information/General Comment:
      iSAC is a proprietary speech and audio codec owned by Google.  The

5.  Mapping to SDP Parameters

   The information carried in the media type specification has a
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [3], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  When SDP is

   used to specify sessions employing the iSAC codec, the mapping is as
   follows:

   o  The media type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

   o  The media subtype (payload format name) goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as
      the encoding name.

   o  Any remaining parameters go in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute by
      copying them directly from the media type string as a semicolon
      separated list of parameter=value pairs.

   The optional parameter ibitrate MUST NOT be higher than the parameter
   maxbitrate.

   The iSAC parameters in an SDP offer are completely independent from
   those in the SDP answer.  For both ibitrate and maxbitrate it is
   legal for the answer to contain a value that is different than what
   is provided in an offer.  The parameter may be present in the answer,
   even if absent in the offer.

   When conveying information by SDP, the encoding name SHALL be "isac"
   (the same as the media subtype).

5.1.  Example Initial Target Bit Rate

   The offer indicates that it wishes to receive a wideband bitstream
   with an initial target rate of 20000 bits per second.  The remote
   party MAY change its initial target rate to the requested value.
   m=audio 10000 RTP/AVP 98
   a=rtpmap: 98 isac/16000
   a=fmtp:98 ibitrate=20000


5.2.  Example Max Bit Rate

   The offer indicates that it wishes to receive a superwideband
   bitstream with an initial target rate of 20000 bits per second, and a
   maximum bit rate of 45000 bits per second.  The remote party MAY
   change its initial target rate and SHOULD NOT transmit at a higher
   rate than 45000.
   m=audio 10000 RTP/AVP 98
   a=rtpmap: 98 isac/32000
   a=fmtp:98 ibitrate=20000;maxbitrate=45000

6.  Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the general security considerations discussed in RFC
   3550 section 8.1.

   As this format transports encoded speech, the main security issues
   include confidentiality and authentication of the speech itself.  The
   payload format itself does not have any built-in security mechanisms.
   External mechanisms, such as SRTP [4], MAY be used.
