Abstract

   TRILL uses distribution trees for multi-destination traffic. Multiple
   trees can be used by an ingress RBridge. Different ingress RBridges
   may choose different distribution trees for the same VLAN and/or
   multicast group traffic. Distribution trees are normally pruned based
   on VLAN. For any RBridge RBn, if RBn has downstream receivers of VLAN
   x in a distribution tree t, there will be an entry of (t, x, port
   list) in the multicast forwarding table on RBn. If there are n trees
   and m VLANs, the multicast forwarding table size on RBn is typically
   n*m entries. The value of m is up to 4096 and n is the total number
   of distribution trees in the campus. If finer granularity filtering
   such as L2/L3 multicast address is used, then the multicast
   forwarding table size further increases dramatically. TRILL multicast
   forwarding table size is limited by hardware and L3 multicasting may
   share the same table with it in hardware implementations. Therefore
   multicast table entry is a precious resource. This document specifies
   a VLAN based tree selection mechanism to reduce the TRILL multicast
   forwarding table size. No data plane change is required.

1. Introduction

1.1. Background

   One or more distribution trees can be used to distribute multi-
   destination frames in a TRILL campus. The RBridge having the highest
   tree root priority announces the total number of trees that are
   computed for the campus. It may also specify the ordered list of tree
   root nicknames that the other RBridges need to compute in the Tree
   Identifiers (TREE-RT-IDs) sub-TLV [RFC6326]. Every RBridge specifies
   the trees it wants to use in the Trees Used Identifiers (TREE-USE-IDs)
   sub-TLV and the VLAN it is interested in the Interested VLANs and
   Spanning Tree Roots (INT-VLAN) sub-TLV [RFC6326]. It is recommended
   that, by default, the ingress RBridge chooses the tree whose root is
   closest for multi-destination frames [RFC6325]. Trees Used
   Identifiers sub-TLV is used to build the RPF table; Interested VLANs
   sub-TLV is used for distribution tree pruning and the multicast
   forwarding table with pruned info is built based on that. Each
   distribution tree SHOULD be pruned per VLAN, eliminating branches
   that have no potential receivers downstream [RFC6325]. Further
   pruning based on L2/L3 multicast address is also possible.

   It is implementation dependant that how many trees to calculate,
   where the tree roots are located and which tree(s) to be used by an
   ingress RBridge. With the increasing demand to use TRILL in data
   center network, there are some features we can explore for multi-
   destination frames in the data center use case. In order to achieve
   non-blocking data forwarding, a fat tree structure is often used.
   Figure 1 shows a typical fat tree structure based data center network.
   RB1&RB2 are aggregation switches and RB11 to RB14 are access switches.
   It is a common practice to choose the tree roots to be at the
   aggregation switches for more efficient traffic transportation. All
   the ingress RBridges which are access switches have the same distance
   to all the tree roots.

1.2. Motivations

   In the structure of figure 1, if we choose to put the tree root at
   RB1 and RB2, the ingress RBridge (e.g. RB11) would find more than one
   closest tree root (i.e. RB1 & RB2). Then an ingress RBridge has two
   options to select: choose one and only one as distribution tree root
   or use ECMP-like algorithm to balance the traffic among the multiple
   trees whose roots are at the same distance. For the former, single
   used tree per ingress RBridge, has the obvious problem of inefficient
   link usage. For example, if RB11 chooses the tree1 which is rooted at
   RB1 as the distribution tree, the link between RB11 and RB2 will
   never be used to ingress the multi-destination frame by RB11. For the
   latter, ECMP based tree selection results in a linear increase in
   multicast forwarding table size with the number of trees as follows.

   A multicast forwarding table on an RBridge is normally used to map
   the key of (tree nickname + VLAN) to an index to a list of ports for
   multicast frame replication. The key used for mapping is simply the
   tree nickname when the RBridge does not prune the tree and the key
   could be (tree nickname + VLAN + L2/L3 multicast address) when the
   RBridge was programmed by control plane with L2/L3 multicast pruning
   information.

   For any RBridge RBn, for each VLAN x, if RBn is in a distribution
   tree t for VLAN x, there will be an entry of (t, x, port list) in the
   multicast forwarding table on RBn. Each entry contains a distinct
   combination of (tree nickname, VLAN) as the lookup key. If there are
   n such trees and m such VLANs, the multicast forwarding table size on
   RBn is n*m entries. If fine-grained label is used [TrillFGL], the

   value of n increases. If finer pruning is used, i.e. VLAN + multicast
   group address is used for pruning, the value of m increases. In
   either case, the number of table entries n*m will increase
   dramatically.

   Figure 2 left table shows an example of the multicast forwarding
   table on RB11 in figure 1 topology with 2 distribution trees in
   campus. The number of entries is 2 * 4K in this case. If 4
   distribution trees are used in a TRILL campus and RBn has 4K VLANs
   with downstream receivers, it consumes 16K table entries.TRILL
   multicast forwarding table has a limited size in hardware
   implementation. The table entry is a precious resource. In some
   implementations, it shares with L3 IP multicast for a total of 16K
   table entries.

   A straightforward way to alleviate the limited table entries is not
   to prune the distribution tree. However it can only be used in the
   restricted scenarios for the following reasons,

   - Unnecessary bandwidth waste for multi-destination frame. There is
      broadcast traffic in each VLAN, like ARP and unknown unicast. In
      addition, if there is huge L3 multicast traffic in some VLAN, no
      pruning may result in worse consequence of L3 user data
      unnecessarily flooded. The volume could be huge if certain
      application like IPTV is supported. Finer pruning like pruning
      based on multicast group may be desirable in this case.

   - Only useful at the pure transit nodes. Edge nodes always need to
      maintain the multicast forwarding table with the key of (tree
      nickname + VLAN) since the edge node needs to decide whether to
      replicate the frame to local access port based on VLAN. It is very
      likely that edge nodes are relatively low scale switches with the
      smaller shared table size available.

   In addition to the multicast table size concern, some silicon does
   not support hashing based tree nickname selection at the ingress
   RBridge currently. VLAN based tree selection is used instead. Control
   plane of ingress RBridge maps the incoming VLAN x to a tree nickname
   t. Then data plane will always use tree t for VLAN x multi-
   destination frames. Though an ingress RB may choose multiple trees to
   be used for load sharing, it can use one and only one tree for single
   VLAN. If we make sure all ingress RBridges campus-wide send VLAN x
   multi-destination frames only using tree t, then there would be no
   need to store the multicast table entry with the key of (tree-other-
   than-t, x) on any RBridge.

Internet-Draft        VLAN based Tree Selection              July 2012


   This document describes the control plane support for VLAN based tree
   selection mechanism to reduce the multicast forwarding table size. It
   consists with the silicon implementation mentioned in the previous
   paragraph. Here VLAN based tree selection is a general term which
   also includes finer granularity case, e.g. VLAN + L2/L3 multicast
   group based selection.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

3. VLAN based Tree Selection

   VLAN based tree selection can be used as a complementary distribution
   tree selection mechanism, especially when the multicast forwarding
   table size is a concern.

3.1. Overview

   The tree root with the highest priority announces the tree nicknames
   and the VLANs allowed on each tree. Such tree-VLAN correspondence
   announcement can be based on static configuration or some predefined
   algorithm. Ingress RBridge selects the tree-VLAN correspondence it
   wishes to use from the list announced by the highest priority tree
   root. It should not transmit VLAN x frame on tree y if the highest
   priority tree root does not say VLAN x is allowed on tree y.

   If we make sure one VLAN is allowed on one and only one tree, we can
   keep the number of multicast forwarding table entries on any RBridge
   fixed at 4K maximum (or up to 16M in case of fine grained label).
   Take Figure 1 as example, two trees rooted at RB1 and RB2
   respectively. The highest priority tree root appoints the tree1 to
   carry VLAN 1-2000 and tree2 to carry VLAN 2001-4095. With such
   announcement by the highest priority tree root, every RBridge which
   understands the announcement will not send the VLAN 2001-4095 on
   tree1 or send the VLAN 1-2000 on tree2. Then no RBridge would need to
   store the entries for tree1/VLAN2001-4095 or tree2/VLAN1-2000. Figure
   2 shows the multicast forwarding table on an RBridge before and after
   we perform the VLAN based tree selection. The number of entries is
   reduced by a factor f , f being the number of trees used in the
   campus. In this example, it is reduced from 2*4095 to 4095. This
   affects both transit nodes and edge nodes. Data plane does not change.

3.2. Sub-TLVs for the Router Capability TLV

   Two new sub-TLVs that can be carried in the Router Capability TLV for
   TRILL are defined below. They can be considered as analog of finer
   granularity version of the Tree Identifiers Sub-TLV and the Trees
   Used Identifiers Sub-TLV in [RFC6326].

3.2.1. The Tree Identifier and VLANs Sub-TLV

   The tree identifiers and VLAN (TREE-VLANs) sub-TLV is used to
   announce the VLANs allowed on each tree by the IS that has the
   highest priority tree root. Multiple instances of this sub-TLV may be
   carried. Same tree nickname may occur in the multiple Tree-VLAN
   Records within the same or across multiple sub-TLVs. The sub-TLV
   format is as follows:

   o Type: Router Capability sub-TLV type, set to 20 (TREE-VLANs).

   o Length: 6*n bytes, where there are n Tree-VLAN Records.

   o Tree Nickname: The nickname at which a distribution tree is
      rooted.

   o RESV: 4 bits that MUST be sent as zero and ignored on receipt.

   o Start.VLAN, End.VLAN: These fields are the VLAN IDs of the allowed
      VLAN range on the tree, inclusive.  To specify a single VLAN, the
      VLAN's ID appears as both the start and end VLAN.

3.2.2. The Tree and VLANs Used Sub-TLV

   This sub-TLV has the same structure as the Tree Identifiers and VLAN
   sub-TLV (TREE-VLANs) specified in Section 3.2.2.  The only difference
   is that its sub-TLV type is set to 21 (TREE-VLAN-USE), and the Tree-
   VLAN record listed are those the originating IS allows.

3.3. Detailed Processing

   The highest priority tree root includes all the necessary tree
   related sub-TLVs defined in [RFC6326] as usual and MAY optionally


Li, et al.             Expires January 3, 2013                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        VLAN based Tree Selection              July 2012


   include the Tree Identifier and VLANs Sub-TLV (Tree-VLANs) in its LSP.
   The highest priority tree root may decide that each VLAN is only
   allowed on one and only one tree to maximize the saving in the
   multicast forwarding table size.

   Ingress RBridge that understands the Tree-VLANs Sub-TLV should select
   the tree-VLAN correspondences it wishes to use and put them in TREE-
   VLAN-USE sub-TLV. If there were multiple tree nicknames announced in
   Tree-VLANs Sub-TLV for a VLAN x, ingress RBridge must choose one of
   them. Ingress RB may choose the minimum distance root from them. How
   to make such choice is out of the scope of this document. It may be
   desirable to have some fixed algorithm to make sure all ingress RBs
   choose the same tree for VLAN x in this case. Any single VLAN that
   the ingress RBridge is interested in should be related to one and
   only one tree ID in TREE-VLAN-USE to minimize the multicast
   forwarding table size on other RBridges.

   When ingress RBridge tries to encapsulate a multi-destination frame
   for VLAN x, it should use the tree nickname that it selected
   previously in TREE-VLAN-USE for VLAN x.

   If RBridge RBn does not perform pruning at all, it builds the
   multicast forwarding table exactly same as that in [RFC6325].

   If RBn prunes the distribution tree based on VLANs, RBn uses the
   information received in TREE-VLAN-USE sub-TLV to mark the set of
   VLANs reachable downstream for each adjacency and for each related
   tree.

   Logically, ingress RBridge that does not support VLAN based tree
   selection is equivalent to the one that supports it and announces all
   the combination pair of tree-id-used and interested-vlan as TREE-
   VLAN-USE.

   RBn may additionally use a flag or special loopback port in a
   multicast forwarding table entry to indicate a multi-destination
   frame need to be decapsulated locally and replicate to access ports.

3.4. Failure Handling

   Failure of a tree root: It is the responsibility of the highest
   priority tree root to inform others the change of the allowed tree-
   VLAN correspondence. When the highest priority tree root learns the
   root of tree t fails, it should re-assign the VLANs allowed on tree t
   to other trees or to a tree replacing the failed one.

Internet-Draft        VLAN based Tree Selection              July 2012


   Failure of the highest priority tree root: It is recommended to pre-
   configure the second highest priority tree root with the proper
   knowledge of the tree-VLAN correspondence allowed when the highest
   priority tree root fails. The information announced by the second
   priority tree root would be stored by all RBridges but would not take
   effect unless the RBridge noticed the failure of the highest priority
   tree root. When the highest priority tree root fails, the original
   second priority tree root will become the highest priority tree root
   of the campus. When an RBridge notices the failure of the original
   highest priority tree root, it can immediately use the stored
   information announced by the original second priority tree root. It
   is recommended to pre-configure the tree-VLAN correspondence
   information on the second highest priority tree root same as that on
   the highest priority tree root for the trees other than the highest
   priority tree itself. This can make the change of multicast
   forwarding table minimum in case of the highest priority tree root
   failure.

   In some transient moment or misbehave of the highest priority tree
   root, an ingress RBridge may encounter the following scenarios:

   - No tree has been announced to allow VLAN x frames

   - An ingress RBridge is supposed to transmit VLAN x frames on tree t,
      but root of tree t is no longer reachable.

   For the second case, an ingress RBridge may choose another reachable
   tree root which allows VLAN x by the highest priority tree root
   announcement. If there is no such tree available, then it is same as
   the first case above. Then the ingress RBridge should be 'downgraded'
   to a conventional BRridge in [RFC6325]. A timer should be set to
   allow the temporary transient stage completion before the change of
   responsive tree or 'downgrade' takes effect. The value of timer
   should at least be set to the LSP flooding time in campus.

3.5. Extensions

   VLAN based tree selection can be easily extended to (VLAN+L2/L3
   multicast group) based tree selection. For example, we can appoint
   multicast group 1 in VLAN 10 to tree1 and appoint group 2 in VLAN 10
   to tree2 for better load sharing. New sub-TLVs are specified below
   for this purpose.

4. Backward Compatibility

   RBridge MUST include the TREE-USE-IDs and INT-VLAN sub-TLVs when
   necessary as per RFC6325 no matter if it supports TREE-VLAN-USE sub-
   TLV.

   RBridge that understands new TREE-VLAN-USE sub-TLV sent from another
   RBridge RBn should use it to build the multicast forwarding table and
   ignore the TREE-USE-IDs and INT-VLAN sub-TLVs sent from the same
   RBridge. It should be noted that TREE-USE-IDs and INT-VLAN sub-TLVs
   are still useful for some purposes other than building multicast
   forwarding table, e.g. RPF table building, spanning tree root
   notification, etc. If the RBridge does not receive TREE-VLAN-USE sub-
   TLV from RBn, it uses the conventional way described in [RFC6325] to
   build the multicast forwarding table.

   For example, there are two distribution trees, tree1 & tree2 in the
   campus. RB1&RB2 are new RBridges which use the new sub-TLVs described
   in this document. RB3 is an old RBridge which is compatible with
   [RFC6325]. Assume RB2 is interested in VLAN 10&11 and RB3 is
   interested in VLAN 100&101. Hence RB1 receives ((tree1,
   VLAN10),(tree2, VLAN11)) as TREE-VLAN-USE sub-TLV and (tree1, tree2)
   as TREE-USE-IDs sub-TLV from RB2 on port x. And RB1 receives (tree1)
   as TREE-USE-IDs sub-TLV and no TREE-VLAN-USE sub-TLV from RB3 on port
   y. RB2 & RB3 announce their interested VLANs in INT-VLAN sub-TLV as
   usual. Then RB1 will build the entry of (tree1, VLAN10, port x) and
   (tree2, VLAN11, port x) based on RB2's LSP and mechanism specified
   in this document. RB1 also builds entry of (tree1, VLAN100, port y),
   (tree1, VLAN101, port y), (tree2, VLAN100, port y), (tree2, VLAN101,
   port y) based on RB3's LSP in conventional way. The multicast
   forwarding table on RB1 with merged entry would be like the following.

      +--------------+-----+---------+
      |tree nickname |VLAN |port list|
      +--------------+-----+---------+
      |   tree 1     |  10 | x       |
      +--------------+-----+---------+
      |   tree 1     | 100 | y       |
      +--------------+-----+---------+
      |   tree 1     | 101 | y       |
      +--------------+-----+---------+
      |   tree 2     |  11 | x       |
      +--------------+-----+---------+
      |   tree 2     | 100 | y       |
      +--------------+-----+---------+
      |   tree 2     | 101 | y       |
      +--------------+-----+---------+


   It is expected that the table is not shrunk as small as the one where
   every RB supports the new TREE-VLAN-USE sub-TLVs. The worst case in a
   hybrid campus is the number of entries equal to the number in current
   practice which does not support VLAN based tree selection. Such

   extreme case happens when the interested VLAN set from the new
   RBridges is a subset of the interested VLAN set from the old RBridges.

   VLAN based tree selection is compatibility with the current practice.
   Its effectiveness increases with more RBridge supporting this feature
   in the TRILL campus.

5. Security Considerations

   This document does not change the general RBridge security
   considerations of the TRILL base protocol.  See Section 6 of
   [RFC6325].

6. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate the new sub-TLV type code as specified
   in Section 3.
