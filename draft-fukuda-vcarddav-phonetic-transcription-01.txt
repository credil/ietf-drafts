Internet-Draft        phonetic transcription Extensions   September 2013


1.  Introduction

   As for the name, the pronunciation(and phonetic transcription) is
   different according to each country. To describe the pronunciation of
   the name, the property is added.

   Also, this property is used to clarify the pronunciation 
   (readings name) of the name.(It is not the purpose of sorting.)
   The description by a country-specific-language and X-SAMPA is also 
   possible.


1.1.  Terminology Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Syntax specifications shown here use the augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF) as described in [RFC5234], and are specified as in the base
   vcard specification [RFC6350].


2.  Identification Property Extensions

   The following sections define the phonetic transcription property.

2.1.  Property: PHONETIC-FULL-NAME

   Namespace:

   Property name:  PHONETIC-FULL-NAME

   Purpose:  To specify the components of the phonetic full name of the
      object the vCard represents.

   Value type:  A single structured text value.

   Cardinality:  *1

   Property parameters:

   Description:  The structured property value corresponds, in sequence,
        to the Phonetic Full Name, Phonetic Family Name and Phonetic 
        Given Name. The text components are separated by the SEMICOLON 
        character (U+003B). To express the pronunciation of the full 
        name, family name and given name, you MAY write the 
        PHONETIC-FULL-NAME property in a country-specific-language.
        The description by a X-SAMPA is also possible.

   Format definition:
     PHONETIC-FULL-NAME-param = "VALUE=text" / altid-param / type-param
                                / language-param / any-param
     PHONETIC-FULL-NAME-value = list-component 2(";" list-component)

   Examples:
       PHONETIC-FULL-NAME;LANGUAGE=jp:<U+3084><U+307E><U+3060> 
       <U+305F><U+308D><U+3046>;<U+3084><U+307E><U+3060>;
       <U+305F><U+308D><U+3046>
      ; <U+XXXX> denotes a UTF8-encoded Unicode character.

       PHONETIC-FULL-NAME;TYPE=IPA-X-SAMPA:jamada ta4oM;;


3.  Security Considerations

   This presents no security considerations beyond those in section 9 of
   the base vcard specification [RFC6350].


4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to add the following entries to the vCard
   Properties registry, defined in [RFC6350] section 10.3.1.

     +-----------+--------------+---------------------------------+
     | Namespace | Property                | Reference            |
     +-----------+--------------+---------------------------------+
     |           | PHONETIC-FULL-NAME      | RFCXXXX, section 2.1 |
     +-----------+--------------+---------------------------------+
