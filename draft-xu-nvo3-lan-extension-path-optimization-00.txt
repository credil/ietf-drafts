1. Problem Statement 

   Virtual Machine (VM) migration and geo-clustering across data 
   centers usually require a LAN to be extended across these data 
   centers. Figure 1 depicts a generic data center interconnect 
   architecture where multiple data centers are interconnected with a 
   given LAN extension solution and remote VPN sites (e.g., cloud user 
   sites) are connected to these data centers with L3VPN solution 
   [RFC4364].

   across these locations. As such, the traffic to/from the extended 
   subnet (e.g., the traffic between cloud user sites and data centers) 
   would encounter suboptimal routing issues as described in the 
   following sub-sections. Such suboptimal routing not only 
   unnecessarily consumes the bandwidth intended for data center 
   interconnect, but also decreases the cloud users' experiences due to 
   increased path latency. Note that here the traffic to/from the 
   extended subnet refers to L3VPN traffic between a remote L3VPN site 
   (e.g., a cloud user site) and data centers, rather than Internet 
   traffic. How to optimize the path for Internet traffic to/from the 
   extended subnet would be explored in the future. 

1.1. Suboptimal Routing for Incoming Traffic 

   Since an IP subnet has been extended across multiple locations, the 
   subnet no longer retains its location semantics. As a result, the 
   incoming traffic towards a given server within the extended subnet 
   could travel through suboptimal paths if the traffic is forwarded 
   based on the corresponding subnet route. For example, assume a 
   server is physically located at data center East of an extended 
   subnet, the incoming traffic towards that server would possibly 
   travel through the default gateway router at data center West when 
   entering that subnet. 

1.2. Suboptimal Routing for Outgoing Traffic 

   Let's assume the existing VPLS solution [RFC4761, RFC4762] is used 
   to achieve LAN extension across multiple data center locations. In 
   this case, VRRP would usually be enabled on default gateway routers 
   of different locations and only one of them would be selected as the 
   VRRP Master for the subnet associated with the extended LAN, which 
   is available for forwarding outgoing traffic of the subnet. In 
   addition, although multiple default gateway routers of different 
   locations could be selected as VRRP masters by filtering VRRP 
   messages among them, since the existing VPLS solution however 
   perform MAC learning as a traditional bridge, the route (e.g., MAC 
   forwarding entry) for a given MAC address would be determined 
   without taking the network distance into account. As a result, if 
   the forwarding path to the VRRP virtual MAC is currently pointed to 
   a default gateway router at data center East, for those servers 
   located at data center West, their outgoing traffic would have to 
   traverse the data center interconnection path so as to reach that 
   default gateway router at data center East, which in turn forwards 
   the traffic out of that subnet.

2. Terminology 

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC4364] and [RFC2338].  

3. Solution Requirements 

   3.1. Path Optimization for Incoming Traffic 

   The basic idea is to allow each default gateway router acting as a 
   L3VPN PE router to propagate host routes for local servers within 
   the extended subnet to remote PE routers. More specifically, a 
   default gateway router at a given data center is allowed to 
   advertise hosts routes only for servers located in that data center, 
   rather than those ones located in other data centers. In this way, 
   remote PE routers would be able to forward traffic destined for a 
   given server within the extended subnet according to the 
   corresponding host route for that server, rather than the subnet 
   route for that extended subnet.  

   The challenge here is how to make default gateway routers be able to 
   tell which servers within the extended subnet are their local ones. 
   Hence the possible solution for this path optimization issue SHOULD 
   ensure default gateway routers to be able to obtain enough information 
   so as to distinguish local servers from remote ones.  

   3.2. Path Optimization for Outgoing Traffic 

   To realize the purposes of default gateway redundancy and VM live 
   mobility across data centers, default gateway routers of a given 
   extended subnet at different locations SHOULD be configured with an 
   identical virtual IP/MAC address pair (i.e., virtual router). As 
   such, servers within the extended subnet could use that virtual 
   router's IP address as their default gateway. To ensure the outgoing 
   traffic with destination MAC address being the virtual router's MAC 
   address to be forwarded to a local default gateway router, rather 
   than any remote default gateway router, just like the anycast manner 
   in IP networks, the LAN extension solution SHOULD be able to select 
   the best route for a given MAC address (e.g., the virtual router's 
   MAC address) among multiple possible routes, e.g., by taking network  
   distance as one factor in the decision-making process of best-route
   selection.
