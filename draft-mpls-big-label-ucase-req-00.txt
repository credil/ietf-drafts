Abstract
   This document describes usecases and requirements for MPLS big label.
   The MPLS label format and encoding method have been specified in [RFC
   3032], the label value is represented by 20-bit space and support up
   to 1 million of instances. This proven technology has been widely
   deployed and worked fine for years. However in certain network
   deployment scenarios of recent years, the 20-bit MPLS label space is
   no longer sufficient to support the widespread adoption of network
   virtualization technologies. In what follows we will describe each of
   the usecase respectively

1.  Introduction

   MPLS label format and encoding method have been specified in [RFC
   3032] for more than 10 years.  The MPLS label value is represented by
   20-bit space that can support up to 1 million of instances. This
   proven technology has been widely deployed and worked fine for years.
   However in the recent years the widespread adoption of network
   virtualization especially SDN technologies are being designed and
   deployed in data center networks, which have culminated in a new set

Internet-Draft  MPLS Big Label Usecases and Requirements    October 2013


   of requirements to the label space, a physical network can be used to
   support up to 16 millions of instances of virtualized overlaid
   networks. When the MPLS/IP L2/L3 VPN reference model is extended to
   interconnect multiple customer sites and data centers, the 20-bit
   space for MPLS label value is not readily to address the demanding of
   new usecases and requirements.

   There a few drafts have proposed the methods to expand the MPLS label
   space and the methods to encoding the packet. Typical drafts are
   following three:

      1. Encoding of Big Labels in MPLS Label Stacks [1]
      2. Mega Label - Expansion of MPLS Label Range in [2]
      3. MPLS Context-Specific Label Space [3]

   However before we move onto discussions about how to expand the label
   space, a question for the usecases and requirements needs to be
   answered. Another usecases of big label could come from MRT MT FRR
   (Maximally Redundant Trees Multi-topology Fast Reroute) and Segment
   Routing applications.  In what follows we will describe each of  use
   case in L3VPN, L2VPN, MRT MT FRR and Segment Routing etc areas, and
   the according requirements

Internet-Draft  MPLS Big Label Usecases and Requirements    October 2013


2.  Big Label Usecase for VPN

   VPN technology allows customer to connect  geographically diverse
   sites and data centers across core networks with ensured performance
   and security. There are many methods designed for VPN connectivity,
   this document will discuss usecases of the MPLS/IP based VPNs. In the
   MPLS/IP VPN reference model, at each site there are one or more
   Customer Edge (CE) devices, each of which is attached to one or more
   Provider Edge (PE) routers via some sort of attachment circuit such
   as PPP, Ethernet/VLAN, etc. 

   When the MPLS IP VPNs reference model is extended to connect to a
   virtual network, the CE devices and PE devices on the data center
   site can be physically the same device: it will be both the PE device
   with respect to the VPN model and the NVE device with respect to the
   network virtualization. With different network protocol used in the
   data center, for example VXLAN and NVGRE as well as NVO3, the
   encoding method of each protocol is different but they all use 24-bit
   space to represent the virtual network instances, which bring up a
   new requirement for MPLS to support 24-bit label space. 

   A question comes out: why we need to use one-to-one mapping between a
   MPLS label and virtual network id?  It is true that some label
   sharing method was used to aggregate multiple VNIs into a single MPLS
   label, which saves the number of MPLS labels and avoid an one-to-one
   mapping between a MPLS label and virtual network id. However one-to-
   many mapping always involves extra algorithm like hashing/lookups etc
   therefor adds overhead to packet encapsulation that impacts the
   performance. Moreover, some deployment uses specific flow
   identification that does not allow the label sharing/aggregation. To
   ensure efficient traffic distribution in virtual network, there is a
   clear need to expand MPLS label space from 20-bits to 24-bits or 32-
   bits for gaining better performance and higher network scalability. 
   Following sections will describe the usecases of L3VPN and L2VPN 
   respectively.

2.1.  MPLS Based L3VPN with VXLAN

   The Figure 1 shows a topology where customer sites are connected to a
   data center via L3VPN over a MPLS core network; the VXLAN protocol of
   [I-D.mahalingam-dutt-dcops-vxlan] is used for network overlay
   virtualiztion in the data center. The customer site is connected to
   MPLS core via CE and PE devices; while  the data center is connected
   to MPLS core via a new device with combined functions of PE and VTEP
   (VXLAN Tunnel End Point), which is marked as PE-VTEP device in Figure
   1. When a network device in CE site wants to send packets to a VM in
   the data center, the PE-VTEP device works like a gateway, the VPN
   header will carrier  VXLAN header information accordingly.

          Figure 1. Interconnecting Customer Sites with VXLAN in DC 

   The PE and PE-VTEP devices on the MPLS core  perform the following
   functions:

   VPN PE functions:  
      It uses BGP to distribute VPN routes; maintains VRFs; uses MPLS to
      receive and forward packets from and to the MPLS network.

   VXLAN VTEP functions:
      It originates and terminates VXLAN tunnels; runs all the necessary
      protocols to build and tear down the VXLAN tunnels; maintains the
      VXLAN tunnel forwarding states including the MAC table;

   L3VPN-VXLAN interworking functions: 
      It maintains the mapping information between L3VPN label and VXLAN
      VNI.  This mapping information is used to receive packets from the
      MPLS network and forward them to the VXLAN network, and receive
      packets from the VXLAN network and forward them to the MPLS
      network

   Because VXLAN uses 24-bits for 16 million number of VNIs, accordingly
   the  existing 2^20 MPLS labels cannot provide one-to-one mapping for
   the possible virtual network instances. In order to provide one-one
   mapping between VPN labels and VNIs that can ensure efficient packet
   encapsulation and distribution of traffic across MPLS core that
   interconnects the customer sites with VXLAN networks,  we need to

   expand the MPLS label space from 20-bits to at least 24-bits to
   support 16 million of label values. Thus in this is the usecase we
   need big label.

2.2.  MPLS Based L3VPN with NVGRE
   NVGRE is another protocol designed to support the multi-tenant and
   massive number of virtual network instances in data center networks.
   NVGRE uses GRE as a method to tunnel L2 packets across MPLS/IP
   network, and a 24-bit segment identifier in the form of a VSID
   (virtual subnet ID), which allows LAN segments to scale to 16 million
   in each  data center. NVGRE allows each LAN segment to be extended
   across MPLS/IP core network.

   NVGRE is similar to VXLAN architecturally. The Figure 2 shows a
   topology where customer sites are connected to a data center via
   L3VPN over a MPLS core network; the NVGRE protocol is used for
   network overlay virtualiztion in the data center. The customer site
   is connected to MPLS core via CE and PE devices; while  the data
   center is connected to MPLS core via a new device with combined
   functions of PE and NVE (virtual network edge), which is marked as
   PE-NVE device in the Figure. When a network device in CE site wants
   to send packets to a VM in the data center, the PE-NVE device works
   like a gateway that maps the VPN header and  NVGRE header
   accordingly.

   following functions:

   VPN PE functions: 
      It uses BGP to distribute VPN routes; maintains VRFs; uses MPLS to
      receive and forward packets from and to the MPLS network.

   NVGRE Endpoint functions: 
      It originates and terminates NVGRE packets; maintains the NVGRE
      Virtual Subnet Identifier (VSID) for NVGRE

   L3VPN-NVGRE Interworking Functions: 
      It maintains the mapping information between L3VPN label and NVGRE
      Virtual Subnet Identifier (VSID).  This mapping information is
      used to receive packets from the MPLS network and forward them to
      the NVGRE virtual network, and receive packets from the NVGRE
      virtual network and forward them to the MPLS network

   Because NVGRE uses 24-bits for 16 million number of VSIDs,
   accordingly we need to expand the MPLS label space from 20-bits to
   24-bits. This way PE-VNE can ensure efficient distribution of traffic
   across MPLS core. This is the use case we need big label too.

2.3.  MPLS Based L2VPN

   In some situation, a L2 network must be extended beyond the single
   data center, for example when the application and framework developed
   for a campus has to be shared by multiple geographic areas, spread
   over multiple data centers and cross long distances. Typically some
   customer wants server-to-server communication between a  primary and
   backup data centers cross a MPLS core network. To ensure high speed
   service, secure connectivity, high availability, application mobility
   and cost-effective requirements, L2 VPN is a good solution to meet
   all of the demands.

   Generally the service provider's customers require a range of VLANs
   to handle multiple applications in case of L2VPN.  VLAN Identifier
   (VID) uses a 12-bit field specifying the VLAN to which the frame
   belongs, it allows up to 4,096 VLAN intances. For this range, the
   current 20-bit MPLS label space is enough. However along with the
   increasing number of VLANs and VMs in data center,  some technology
   such as E-VPN and Q-in-Q have been proposed to support large-scale
   L2VPNs with resiliency. 

   A good example is illustrated at Figure 3 that gives a topology of
   data center LAN extension using L2VPN over MPLS core network. In this
   usecase data center uses IEEE 802.1Q-in-Q VLAN Tag Termination for
   intranet. Q-in-Q added another layer of VLAN tag (called "metro tag"
   or "PE-VLAN") to serve the purpose of VLAN space expansion. In such a

   way, a data center could support 4096 * 4096 allowing 16 million of
   VLAN IDs; therefor the 20-bit MPLS label space is no longer
   sufficient to provide a one-to-one mapping between  the double tagged
   VLAN IDs and a MPLS label. The one-to-one mapping can be done by
   expand the MPLS label space to 24-bits as it is shown at Figure 3.

   In Figure 3, double tagged VLAN IDs occupy 24-bit label space, it
   provided a usecase and requirement for MPLS big label.


3.  Usecase of MRT MT and FRR 

   In some deployment of Fast Reroute protection,  the global label
   allocation(GLA) is used to represent a LSP for fast switchover. In
   the event of a link failure, traffic on an LSP is rerouted to the
   next-hop using a pre-configured backup LSP identified by a global
   MPLS label. With GLA, Protected LSP and backup LSP can be setup
   through same interface, any MPLS frame received  will be switched
   based on its global label regardless its incoming interface. Together
   with make-before-break method it can achieve the fast traffic
   recovery.

   When the same FRR mechanism is applied to MRT MT (Maximally Redundant
   Trees Multi-topology) scenario, the 20-bit MPLS label space will not
   be sufficient. For example, assume that there are three topologies

   configured in a MPLS core network, each topology is colored to yellow
   (default), red and blue respectively. When enabling the whole network
   FRR by incremental deployment of LDP MT in the IP network, the MPLS
   label has to be globally unique in order to achieve fast reroute.
   Since the number of Internet route is around 500,000 based on some
   statistics, when MPLS labels are allocated in the yellow (default),
   blue and red multi-topology respectively and simultaneously, the
   required labels for allocation will reach 3 times 500,000 at least
   1.5million, thus it exceeds the existing 20-bit MPLS label range of 1
   million labels.

   This kind of use cases impose a requirement to the MPLS big label.

4.  Usecase of Segment Routing

   Segment Routing is another example of the use cases that may
   potentially require MPLS big label. The Segment identification SID
   uses 32-bit space(draft-filsfils-rtgwg-segment-routing-00), it is
   used either for a topological instruction or a service instruction. 
   An instruction associated with a global segment is recognized and
   executed by any SR-capable node in the domain.  

   Because MPLS label space has only 20-bits, the right-most bits of the
   segment are encoded as a label. This implies that the SID values are
   allocated within a reduced 20-bit space out of the 32-bit SID space,
   the maximum number of segments in a routing domain is limited to 1
   million not as SR was designed for 4 Billion with 32-bit SID space.
   It is a reasonable question if it will eventually hits the
   scalability issue once the size of the network increases to a certain
   degree. As soon as the number of segments  exceed 1 million in a
   network domain, for example a SDN domain, the 20-bit MPLS label space
   will need to be expanded from 20-bit to bigger number such as 24-bits
   or 32-bits.

5.  NVO3 Usecase

   NVO3 is an on-going effort to standardize solutions to data center
   virtualizaiton with the goal of providing viable data encapsulation
   and protocols across a scaling range of a few thousand VMs to several
   million VMs running on greater than one hundred thousand physical
   servers.  NVO3 considers approaches to multi-tenancy that reside at
   the network layer rather than using traditional isolation mechanisms
   that rely on the underlying layer 2 technology (e.g. VLANs).

   Based on NVO3 framework and problem statement, NVO3 will deliver 16
   million virtual networks in a physical data center. As described for
   L3 and L2 VPN use cases, we will need to solve the problem of
   associating MPLS labels to NVO3 VNIDs, thus it implies another

   potential use case for MPLS big label. 

6.  Big Label Requirements


   When design MPLS big label applied to the use cases described in this
   document, following requirements should be considered.

      1.  An extension to the MPLS label format of RFC 3032 should be
      specified for big label

      2. Big label label needs 24-bit space with 16 million of labels to
      support interworking with VXLAN/NVGRE/NVO3; The same requirement
      is applicable for L2VPN in case of using Q-in-Q

      3. Big label needs 32-bit space with 1 billion of labels in order
      to support the number of SIDs specified by Segment Routing

      4. PE device in MPLS core network must advertise its big label
      process capability to other devices in the same routing domain

      5. Every PE device must enable big label capability in order to
      distribute traffic using big label in the same routing domain. A
      mechanism needs to be specified if allowing some explicit nodes
      not to use big label in this routing domain.

      6. PE devices must be capable to support expanded number of
      virtual interfaces and forwarding entries etc that could reach 16
      million or 1 billion in the worst case.  

      7.Big label framework needs to be backward compatible. The network
      device supporting big label must too have capability to process
      regular 20-bit label.

      8. The big label should work with the existing MPLS hardware
      architecture

7.  IANA Considerations

      The requirements on IANA are specified in other related documents
      [I-D.draft-renwei-mpls-big-label] and [I-D.draft-renwei-mpls-bgp-
      big- label], which request a reserved label to represent Big Label
      Indicator and BGP capabilities for big labels.

8.  Security Considerations

      This draft does not add any additional security implications to
      the BGP/MPLS IP VPNs.  All existing authentication and security
