1. Introduction

   This document describes the BGP encodings and procedures for
   exchanging the information elements required by applying traffic
   performance monitoring in MPLS/BGP VPN, as specified in [ID.draft-
   dong-l3vpn-pm-framework-01].

Internet-Draft        BGP Extension For L3VPN PM             July 2013


   Current BGP Labeled VPN Route exchange procedure combines VRF VPN-
   membership Auto-Discovery and L3VPN Label allocation together. While
   applying PM for L3VPN needs BGP extended to support VPN membership
   Auto-Discovery and L3VPN Label allocation in a VRF-to-VRF manner. To
   achieve this, a new Sub address family, called VRF-to-VRF Tunnel(VT) 
   Subsequent Address Family, is introduced.

   This document defines two kinds of routes for VT NLRI:

    VPN-Membership A-D Route: for the use of doing VRF VPN membership
    auto-discovery in VRF-to-VRF manner

    VT Labeled Route: for the use of allocating VT Label from Local VRF
    to Remote VRF to setup VRF-to-VRF Tunnel between the pair of VRFs.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119
   [RFC2119].

3. Terminologies

   This document uses the terminologies defined in [RFC4026]:

   ERT: Export Route Target

   IRT: Import Route Target

   PE: Provider Edge

   RD: Route Distinguisher

   VRF: Virtual Routing and Forwarding

   VT: VRF-to-VRF Tunnel

4. The New VT Sub Address Family

   The BGP Multiprotocol Extensions [RFC4760] allow BGP to carry routes
   from multiple "address families". In this document a new Subsequent
   Address Family is introduced, called "VT Sub Address Family".

5. Operations

5.1. VRF-to-VRF VPN Membership Auto Discovery

   For every PE, it needs to process all its VRF configured and
   generate one VT A-D Route for each VRF respectively.

   RD field MUST be filled with the VRF's RD value.

Internet-Draft        BGP Extension For L3VPN PM             July 2013


   Local Router's IP Address field MUST filled with the Advertising
   Router's IP address.

   The VT A-D Route MUST carry all IRTs of the VRF in BGP Update's Ext-
   Community Path Attribute, route importing request of one VRF is
   described by its corresponding VT A-D route. In contrast VPN Labeled
   Routes carry ERTs in BGP Update's Ext-Community Path Attribute.

   If a VRF is created, then its corresponding VT A-D Route MUST be
   generated and advertised.

   If the VRF whose VT A-D Route has been advertised is deleted, then
   the VT A-D Route Withdrawal message MUST be generated and advertised.

   If IRT of the VRF whose VT A-D Route has been advertised is changed,
   then a VT A-D Route Update with same Prefix and latest IRTs MUST be
   advertised.

   When receiving PE receives VT A-D Route, VPN relationship matching
   MUST be checked between IRTs in VT A-D Route and ERTs of each Local
   VRF, this process is called VRF-to-VRF VPN membership Auto Discovery.

   Either finding one VRF-to-VRF VPN membership newly formed or
   released, receiving PE MUST proceed to the VT Labeled Route
   processing described in next section.



5.2. VRF-to-VRF Labeled Route Exchange

5.2.1. VT Labeled Route Update

   If Receiving PE finds one new VRF-to-VRF VPN membership formed, it
   MUST allocate one VT MPLS Label for the VRF-to-VRF VPN membership
   and the label is advertised to the Remote VRF by VT Labeled Route.

   Local RD MUST filled with RD value of the Local VRF which is found
   belong to the same VPN with Remote VRF.

   Local Router's IP Address Must filled with the advertising PE's
   IPv4/IPv6 address.

   Remote VRF's RD MUST filled with RD value of the Remote VRF which
   belongs to a same VPN with the Local VRF.

   Remote Router's IP Address: Remote PE's IPv4/IPv6 address.

Internet-Draft        BGP Extension For L3VPN PM             July 2013


   Label: MUST be filled with one or more MPLS Labels allocated by
   advertising PE for the pair of VRFs.

   Only both sides of a pair of VRFs learnt each other's VT Labeled
   Route advertisement, the VRF-to-VRF tunnel between the pair of VRFs
   is considered setup.

5.2.2. VT Labeled Route Withdrawal

   If receiving PE finds one existing VRF-to-VRF VPN membership
   released then it MUST send out the VT Labeled Route Withdrawal
   message, then release the MPLS Label(s) allocated.

   Local RD MUST be filled with RD value of the Local VRF.

   Local Router's IP Address MUST be filled with the advertising PE's
   IPv4/IPv6 address.

   Remote VRF's RD MUST be filled with RD value of the Remote VRF.

   Remote Router's IP Address: MUST be filled with Remote PE's
   IPv4/IPv6 address.

   Label: MUST be filled with ZERO or the MPLS Labels value allocated
   for the VT Labeled Route.

5.3. VRF-to-VRF Labeled Route Application

   To achieve the goal of converting normal L3VPN MP2P forwarding model
   into P2P model which is required in [ID.draft-zheng-l3vpn-pm-
   analysis-01], after VPNv4 routes received, Receiving PE MUST apply
   VT Labels when downloading VPNv4 Route into Data Plan which is in
   detail described in [I-D.dong-l3vpn-pm-framework].

   Between a pair of PEs both support VT capability, It COULD be an
   implementation option that VPNv4 Routes from a remote VRF WOULD NOT
   be downloaded into a Local VRF's Forwarding Plan until a VT Labeled
   route received from same Remote VRF for the Local VRF.

   If VT Labeled Route withdrawal message is received, receiving PE
   MUST delete VT Labels from Forwarding Plane and VPNv4 Routes MUST be
   kept on Forwarding Plane with original VPNv4 Label as inner Label.

6. VT Route Selection Consideration

   When receiving and processing VT A-D Route, the BGP best route
   selection procedure described in [RFC4271] MUST be followed.

Internet-Draft        BGP Extension For L3VPN PM             July 2013


   When receiving and processing VT Labeled Route, the BGP best route
   selection procedure described in [RFC4271] COULD be followed.

   Especially VT Labeled Route MUST be advertised ONLY to the BGP peer
   from which the best VT A-D route is received, the VT A-D route
   contains the Remote VRF's RD and Remote PE's IP address.

   If a Peer receives VT A-D or VT Labeled Route originated from itself,
   the route MUST be ignored.

7. Deployment Consideration

   This document currently supports deploying VT SAFI in following two
   manners:

   a)Inner-AS L3VPN with Full-mesh IBGP sessions or Router Reflectors.

   b)Inter-AS L3VPN with Option A(VRF-to-VRF)[RFC4364].

   How to support Inter-AS L3VPN Option B(MP-EBGP) and Option-C
   [RFC4364] will be described in this draft's future version.

8. Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues.

9. IANA Considerations

   A new SAFI value to present VT Subsequent Address Family is required
   and to be allocated by IANA.
