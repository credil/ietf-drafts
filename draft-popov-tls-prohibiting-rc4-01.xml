      <t>This document requires that Transport Layer Security (TLS) clients and servers 
      never negotiate the use of RC4 cipher suites when they establish connections.</t>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>RC4 is a stream cipher described in <xref target="SCH" />, which is widely 
      supported, and often preferred, by TLS servers. However, RC4 has long been known 
      to have a variety of cryptographic weaknesses, e.g. <xref target="PAU" />, 
      <xref target="MAN" />, <xref target="FLU" />. Recent cryptanalysis results 
      <xref target="ALF" /> exploit biases in the RC4 keystream to recover repeatedly 
      encrypted plaintexts.</t>

      <t>These recent results are on the verge of becoming practically exploitable; 
      currently they require 2^26 sessions or 13x2^30 encryptions. As a result, RC4 can 
      no longer be seen as providing a sufficient level of security for TLS sessions.</t>

      <t>This document requires that TLS (<xref target="RFC5246" />, 
      <xref target="RFC4346" />, <xref target="RFC2246" />) clients and servers never 
      negotiate the use of RC4 cipher suites.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />.</t>

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>TLS clients MUST NOT include RC4 cipher suites in the ClientHello message.</t>

          <t>TLS servers MUST NOT select an RC4 cipher suite when a TLS client sends such a 
          cipher suite in the ClientHello message.</t>

          <t>If the TLS client only offers RC4 cipher suites, the TLS server MUST terminate 
          the handshake. The TLS server MAY send the insufficient_security fatal alert in this 
          case.</t>

      <t>This document helps maintain the security guarantees of the TLS protocol by prohibiting 
      the use of the RC4-based cipher suites (listed in <xref target="app-rc4-cipher-suites" />), 
      which do not provide a sufficiently high level of security.</t>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
