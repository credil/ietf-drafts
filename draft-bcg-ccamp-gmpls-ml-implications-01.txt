1.  Introduction

   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) supports the control of multiple switching
   technologies: packet switching, Layer-2 switching, TDM (Time-Division
   Multiplexing) switching, wavelength switching, and fiber switching
   ([RFC3945]).

   The Interface Switching Capability concept has been defined for the
   advertisement of the Switching Capabilities of the different
   interfaces of a node [RFC4202], while in the context of Multi Region
   Networks (MRN) the Interface Adjustment Capabiltiy concept has been
   introduced [RFC5339] for the advertisement of adjustment capacity
   within an hybrid node.

   With the introduction of G709v3 networks, a new Switching Capability
   (OTN-TDM) has been defined [OSPF-OTN] and the ISCD updated in order
   to cope with the OTN specific multi stage multiplexing capabilities.
   The new Switching Capability Specific Information (SCSI) field
   provides information about the bandwidth availability at each layer
   of the OTN hierarchy and about the operations that can be performed
   on the different layers, in terms of termination and switching
   capabilities.

   These issues have been addressed in the OTN documents within the OTN
   multi layer scope but need to be extended to MRNs, where the
   termination of a hierarchical LSP leads to the need of properly
   managing different switching capabilities and different adaptation
   functions.

   Scope of this document is describing new requirements derived from
   the extension of OTN MLN hierarchies to MRNs and evaluating impacts
   on existing solutions.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Applicability Scenarios

   When moving from OTN MLNs to general MRNs, the multiplexing tree
   concept introduced in [OSPF-OTN] needs to be extended so to take into
   account both different switching capabilities within the same muxing
   tree and adaptations between client hierarchies and server
   hierarchies.

   In the following figure an example of muxing tree supporting TDM,
   PSC, OTN-TDM and LSC hierarchies mixed together is shown.

                           Figure 1: Muxing tree

   As it is possible to understand from the figure above, an MRN
   equipment can host a variety of client-server relationships.  Four
   different scenarios can be identified:

      - A signal type X is a client to a Signal type Y (1:1) - e.g.
      Ethernet over WDM

      - A signal type X is a client to a Intra switching technology
      Hierarchy Y (1:N) - e.g.  Ethernet over OTN

      - An Intra switching technology Hierarchy X is a client to a
      Signal Type Y (M:1) - e.g.  ODU over WDM

      - An Intra switching technology Hierarchy X is a client to an
      Intra switching technology Hierarchy Y (M:N) - e.g.  SDH over OTN

   Being the first three scenarios a particular case of the fourth one,
   in the following only the general case of M:N relationship will be
   addressed.

   This kind of client-server hierarchy can be achieved, depending on
   the impelemntation, via single board or a cascade of them.  In the
   latter case boards are connected via internal links, which can be
   either intra or inter switching capaility (e.g.  ODU2->ODU3 or
   PSC->LSC).  Those links should not be modeled as external TE links,
   but there is the need to advertise their characteristics and

   Moreover, as described in [RFC5212], in a hybrid node there is the
   need to take into account also the node's internal adjustment
   capabilities between the switching technologies supported.  An
   example of hybrid node with different switching matrices is shown in
   the following figure, where both an SDH and OTN matrix are available
   and the two switching elements are internally interconnected so that
   it is possible to terminate some resources (e.g.  OTN interface Y1)
   or provide adjustment for the SDH traffic (e.g.  OTN interface Y2
   toward the SDH matrix).  In addition to the internal links between
   matrices it is possible to have internal links between matrices and
   cascaded cards for the creation of the muxing hierarchy.  In the
   example below both the SDH and OTN matrices are client to an
   ODU2->ODU3 muxponder (through interfaces Y4 and Y5), which in turn is
   client to an OCh WSS.

3.  Requirements

   In order to deal with all the scenarios depiscted in the previous
   sections, protocol extensions need to take into account the following
   set of requirements.

      1.  It must be possible to identify from which branch of X to
      which branch of Y the mapping is performed.  Due to a restricted
      connectivity to a given switching layer, not all the indicated
      branches are really available.  An example of such limitations can
      be seen in figure Figure 3, where for example the SDH client can
      be mapped only on itnerface Y5 of the muxponder board or the
      10GbEth on interface Y6.  In figure Figure 1 it is also possible
      to see that the OTN has a hierarchy with 3 branches (i.e.
      ODU1->ODU2->ODU3, ODU2->ODU3 and ODU1->ODU3) and an SDH signal can
      be mapped only over the ODU2->ODU3 branch while an Ethernet one



Ceccarelli, et al.      Expires January 17, 2013                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          Multi layer implications               July 2012


      can be mapped only on the ODU1->ODU3).  So it is not eough to say
      that SDH can be mapped over ODU or Eth over ODU as further info is
      needed.  Moreover it is also not enough to say that Eth is mapped
      over ODU1 because in the same example 2 different branches have
      the ODU1 as the top most layer (i.e.  ODU1->ODU2->ODU3 and
      ODU1->ODU3) and not both of them can support Eth mapping.

      2.  Adaptation information from X to Y to be used both in case of
      Y being switched and X mapped over it or in case of both X and Y
      being switched.  Please note that more than one type of adaptation
      might be availble.

      3.  Amount of available bandwidth in the mapping between X and Y
      (as per actual IACD definition)

      4.  It must be possible to advertise intra-switching capability
      associated to internal links.  A typical case is a hierarchy
      gained through the cascade of multiple cards (e.g. trasnponders,
      muxponders) and the link from one board to the other one has a
      given bandwidth.

      5.  It must be possible to advertise inter-switching capability
      associated to internal links.  A typical case is a M:N client-
      layer hierarchy gained through the cascade of multiple cards (e.g.
      SDH client to a muxponder card) and the link from one board to the
      other one has a given bandwidth.


4.  Evaluation

   [RFC6001] defined the Interface Adjustment Capability Descriptor
   (IACD) for the advertisement of internal adjustment capability of
   hybrid nodes [RFC5212].

   A common adjustment pool is a pool of reservable and sharable
   resources that are i) allocated on demand/dynamically and ii) either
   assigned to a single SC (single adjustment pool model) or multiple SC
   (multiple adjustment pool model) or possibly their combination.

   In the former case (single pool model), the "lower SC" value of the
   IACD (associated to the adjustment pool) is set to the SC value of
   ISCD sub-TLV of the interface that gets access to the adjustment pool
   and the "upper" SC value of the IACD (associated to the adjustment
   pool) determines the SC capability of the resource pool.  In this
   case the (upper) encoding is set to 0xFF.  In other terms, the
   capacity of the adustment pool is not directly accessible - over the
   wire - by other nodes belonging to the same TE domain (assuming
   homogeneous LSP encoding type along the LSP path).  This model (see



Ceccarelli, et al.      Expires January 17, 2013                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          Multi layer implications               July 2012


   Example 1) is typically used when the node matrix switching
   capability is not terminating/initiating any LSP (the node only
   exposes the capability associated to its I/O) but nodes part of the
   same TE domain can still take into account the adjustment capacity
   usage on that node.

   In the latter case (multiple pool model), the "lower SC" value of the
   IACD (associated to the adjustment pool) is set to the SC value of
   ISCD sub-TLV of the interface(s) that gets access to the adjustment
   pool and the "upper" SC value of the IACD (associated to the
   adjustment pool) determines the SC capability of the adjustment pool
   itself, however, this "upper SC" value is not associated to any ISCD
   sub-TLV (compared to the single pool model where the "upper SC" value
   corresponds to at least one of the SC value associated to the ISCD
   sub-TLVs).  In other terms, the (lower) SC value associated to each
   adjustment pool shall be covered by at least one of the SC associated
   to the ISCD sub-TLVs.  This model (see Example 2) is typically used
   when nodes expose their full (multi-level) grooming and initiation/
   termination capacity.

   Example of single pool model: in the IACD sub-TLV the "upper" SC type
   = TDM/HO-SDH, and the "lower" SC type being respectively "L2SC" and
   "OTH/TDM".  In this example, the capacity associated to the IACD
   represents the "interconnection capacity" between the interface X
   (L2SC or OTH) to Y = (HO-SDH/TDM).  The encoding type associated to
   the upper SC is set to 0xFF.

                  Figure 4: Example of single pool model

   The advertisement for the node interfaces will be:

      + L2SC interfaces

         - ISCD sub_TLV 1 for L2SC interface

         - IACD sub_TLV 1 for L2SC to HO-SDH (1) in figure above

      + OTH inferfaces

         - ISCD sub_TLV 1 for OTH interface

         - IACD sub_TLV 1 for OTH to HO-SDH (2) in figure above

   Example of multiple pool model: In this case we will show two
   examples, the first of which does not foresee any interconnection
   between the L2SC and the HO-SDH matrices, while the second one does.

   In the former case there is at least one ISCD sub-TLV of SC = X
   corresponding to the lower SC value (HO-SDH/TDM) of the IACD sub-TLV
   associated to the first adjustment pool (HO-SDH/TDM), and one ISCD
   sub-TLV of type SC = Y corresponding to the lower SC value (L2SC) of
   the IACD sub-TLV associated to the second adjustment pool Y (L2SC).
   In this example, the capacity associated to the IACD represents the
   "interconnection capacity" between the pool of SC = X (HO-SDH/TDM) to
   Y (L2SC).  Each TE Link 1...N is able to get access to this
   adjustment capacity.

   The IACD is the only object defined in routing for the management of
   hybrid nodes.  It provides the information for the forwarding/
   switching capability and is used in addition to the ISCD.

5.  Missing information

   The pieces of information needed for addressing the requirements
   listed in Section 3 are:

      - Adaptation information from a client to a server layer

      - Connectivity constraints: need to describe optical transponder
      muxing scheme with positioning and restricted connectivity in



Ceccarelli, et al.      Expires January 17, 2013               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft          Multi layer implications               July 2012


      order to provide end to end connectivity.  In the example shown in
      picture Figure 1, the capability of muxing an SDH hierarchy is
      shown, but the SDH cannot be injected in any branch of the OTN
      hierarchy.  There is the need to specify that the SDH hierarchy
      can be only muxed into the ODU->ODU3 branch of the OTN hierarchy
      and not in all of them.

      Multistage interswitching capability: The IACD already allows
      advertising the multiplexing of single and multi-stage muxing
      scenarios like the one in the reference muxing tree, where an SDH
      hierarchy is muxed over an OTN hierarchy, which is againg muxed
      over an OCh (two levels of muxing).
