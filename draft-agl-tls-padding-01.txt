1.  Introduction

   Successive TLS [RFC5246] versions have added support for more cipher
   suites and, over time, more TLS extensions have been defined.  This
   has caused the size of the TLS ClientHello to grow and the additional
   size has caused some implementation bugs to come to light.  At least
   some of these implementation bugs can be ameliorated by making the
   ClientHello even larger.

   This memo describes a TLS extension that can be used to pad a
   ClientHello to a desired size in order to avoid implementation bugs
   caused by certain ClientHello sizes.

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Padding Extension

   A new extension type (""padding(TBD)"") is defined and MAY be
   included by the client in its ClientHello message.
   enum {
           padding(TBD), (65535)
   } ExtensionType

   The client MUST fill the padding extension completely with zero
   bytes, although the padding extension may be empty.

   The server SHOULD verify that the extension is either empty or
   contains only zero bytes, in order to avoid allowing the padding
   extension contents to be used as a side-channel.  (Although the
   length of the extension can still be used as such.)

   The server MUST NOT echo the extension.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an extension value for the padding
   extension from its ExtensionType registry.
