 Lightweight Secure Neighbor Discovery for Low-power and Lossy Networks
                    draft-sarikaya-6lowpan-cgand-02

Abstract

   This document defines lightweight secure neighbor discovery for low-
   power and lossy networks.  The nodes generate a Cryptographically
   Generated Address, register the Cryptographically Generated Address
   with a default router and periodically refresh the registration.
   Modifications to 6lowpan Neighbor Discovery protocol are described
   for secure neighbor discovery for low-power and lossy networks.
   Cryptographically generated address and digital signatures are
   calculated using elliptic curve cryptography, so that the
   cryptographic operations are suitable for low power devices.

1.  Introduction

   Neighbor discovery for IPv6 [RFC4861] and stateless address
   autoconfiguration [RFC4862], together referred to as neighbor
   discovery protocols (NDP), are defined for regular hosts operating
   with wired/wireless links.  These protocols are not suitable and
   require optimizations for resource constrained, low power hosts
   operating with lossy wireless links.  Neighbor discovery
   optimizations for 6lowpan networks include simple optimizations such
   as a host address registration feature using the address registration
   option which is sent in unicast Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and
   Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd].

   Neighbor discovery protocols (NDP) are not secure especially when
   physical security on the link is not assured and vulnerable to
   attacks defined in [RFC3756].  Secure neighbor discovery protocol
   (SEND) is defined to secure NDP [RFC3971].  Cryptographically
   generated addresses (CGA) are used in SEND [RFC3972].  SEND mandates
   the use of the RSA signature algorithm which is computationally heavy
   and not suitable to use for low-power and resource constrained nodes.
   The use of an RSA public key and signature leads to long message
   sizes not suitable to use in low-bit rate, short range, asymmetric
   and non-transitive links such as IEEE 802.15.4.

   In this document we extend the 6lowpan neighbor discovery protocol
   with cryptographically generated addresses.  The nodes generate CGAs
   and register them with the default router.  CGA generation is based
   on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)and signature is calculated using
   elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) known to be
   lightweight, leading to much smaller packet sizes.  The resulting
   protocol is called Lightweight Secure Neighbor Discovery Protocol
   (LSEND).


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
   [RFC3971], [RFC3972] in addition to the ones specified in
   [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd].

3.  Problem Statement

   In this section we state requirements of a secure neighbor discovery
   protocol for low-power and lossy networks.

   The protocol MUST be based on the Neighbor Discovery Optimization for
   Low-power and Lossy Networks protocol defined in
   [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd] due to the host-initiated interactions to allow
   for sleeping hosts, elimination of multicast-based address resolution
   for hosts, etc.

   New options to be added to neighbor solicitation messages MUST lead
   to small packet sizes.  Smaller packet sizes facilitate low-power
   transmission by resource constrained nodes on lossy links.

   CGA generation, signature and key hash calculation MUST avoid the use
   of SHA-1 which is known to have security flaws.  In this document, we
   use SHA-2 instead of SHA-1 and thus avoid SHA-1's flaws.

   Public key and signature sizes MUST be minimized and signature
   calculation MUST be lightweight.  In this document we adopt ECC and
   ECDSA with the P-256 curve in order to meet this requirement.


4.  New Options

4.1.  CGA Parameters and Digital Signature Option

   This option contains both CGA parameters and the digital signature.

   A summary of the CGA Parameters and Digital Signature Option format

   A summary of the Digital Signature Option format is shown below.
   Note that this option has the same format as RSA Signature Option
   defined in [RFC3971].  The differences are that Digital Signature
   field carries an ECDSA signature not an RSA signature, and in
   calculating Key Hash field SHA-2 is used instead of SHA-1.

   Length

      The length of the option (including the Type, Length, Reserved,
      Key Hash, Digital Signature and Padding fields) in units of 8
      octets.
   Key Hash

      The Key Hash field is a 128-bit field containing the most
      significant (leftmost) 128 bits of a SHA-2 hash of the public key
      used for constructing the signature.  This is the same as in
      [RFC3971] except for SHA-1 which has been replaced by SHA-2.
   Digital Signature

      Same as in Section 4.1.
   Padding

      The Padding field contains a variable-length field containing as
      many bytes long as remain after the end of the signature.

4.3.  Calculation of the Digital Signature and CGA Using ECC

   Due to the use of Elliptic Curve Cryptography, the following
   modifications are needed to [RFC3971] and [RFC3972].

   The digital signature is constructed by using the sender's private
   key over the same sequence of octets specified in Section 5.2 of
   [RFC3971] up to all neighbor discovery protocol options preceding the
   Digital Signature option containing the ECC-based signature.  The
   signature value is computed using the ECDSA signature algorithm as
   defined in [SEC1] and hash function SHA-256.

   Public Key is the most important parameter in CGA Parameters defined
   in Section 4.1.  Public Key MUST be DER-encoded ASN.1 structure of
   the type SubjectPublicKeyInfo formatted as ECC Public Key. The
   AlgorithmIdentifier, contained in ASN.1 structure of type
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo, MUST be the (unrestricted) id- ecPublicKey
   algorithm identifier, which is OID 1.2.840.10045.2.1, and the
   subjectPublicKey MUST be formatted as an ECC Public Key, specified in
   Section 2.2 of [RFC5480].

   Note that the ECC key lengths are determined by the namedCurves
   parameter stored in ECParameters field of the AlgorithmIdentifier.
   The named curve to use is secp256r1 corresponding to P-256 which is
   OID 1.2.840.10045.3.1.7 [SEC2].

   ECC Public Key could be in uncompressed form or in compressed form
   where the first octet of the OCTET STRING is 0x04 and 0x02 or 0x03,
   respectively.  Point compression using secp256r1 reduces the key size

   by 32 octets.  In LSEND, point compression MUST be supported.


5.  Protocol Interactions

   Lightweight Secure Neighbor Discovery for Low-power and Lossy
   Networks (LSEND for LLN) modifies Neighbor Discovery Optimization for
   Low-power and Lossy Networks [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-nd] as explained in
   this section.  Protocol interactions are shown in Figure 1.

   6LoWPAN Border Routers (6LBR) send router advertisements (RA).
   6LoWPAN Nodes (6LN, or simply "nodes") receive these RAs and generate
   their own cryptographically generated addresses using elliptic curve
   cryptography as explained in Section 4.3.  The node sends a neighbor
   solicitation (NS) message with the address registration option (ARO)
   to 6LBR.  Such a NS is called an address registration NS.

   An LSEND for LLN node MUST send an address registration NS message
   after adding CGA Parameters and Digital Signature Option defined in
   Section 4.1.  Source address MUST be set to its crypotographically
   generated address.  An LSEND for LLN node MUST set the Owner
   Interface Identifier field (EUI-64) in ARO to the rightmost 64 bits
   of its crypotographically generated address.  The Subnet Prefix field
   of CGA Parameters MUST be set to the leftmost 64 bits of its
   crypotographically generated address.  The Public Key field of CGA
   Parameters MUST be set to the node's ECC Public Key.

   6LBR receives the address registration NS. 6LBR then verifies the
   source address as described in Section 5.1.2. of [RFC3971] using the
   claimed source address and CGA Parameters field in the message.
   After successfully verifying the address 6LBR next does a
   cryptographic check of the signature included in the Digital
   Signature field in the message.  If all checks succeed then 6LBR
   performs a duplicate address detection procedure on the address.  If
   that also succeeds 6LBR registers the CGA in the neighbor cache. 6LBR
   also caches the node's public key.

   6LBR sends an address registration neighbor advertisement (NA) as a
   reply to confirm the node's registration.  Status is set to 0 to
   indicate success.  This completes initial address registration.  The
   address registration needs to be refreshed after the neighbor cache
   entry times out.

                Figure 1: Lightweight SEND for LLN Protocol

   In order to refresh the neighbor cache entry, an LSEND for LLN node
   MUST send an address registration NS message after adding the Digital
   Signature Option defined in Section 4.2.  The Key Hash field is a
   hash of the node's public key and MUST be set as described in
   Section 4.2.  The Digital Signature field MUST be set as described in
   Section 4.2.

   6LBR receives the address registration refresh NS. 6LBR uses the key
   hash field in Digital Signature Option to find the node's public key
   from the neighbor cache. 6LBR verifies the digital signature in the
   NS.  In case of successful verification, 6LBR sends back an address
   registration neighbor advertisement (NA) to the node and sets the
   status to 0 indicating successful refreshment of the CGA of the node.
   Similar refresh NS and NA exchanges happen afterwards as shown in
   Figure 1.

5.1.  Packet Sizes

   An original address registration NS message that contains a 40 byte
   header and ARO is 16 octets.  DER-encoded ECC Public Key for P-256
   curve is 88 octets long uncompressed and 88-32=56 octets with point
   compression.  Digital Signature field when using ECDSA for P-256
   curve is 72 octets long without padding bytes for a DER encoding of
   the ASN.1 type "ECDSA-sig-value" [ANSIX9.62].

   CGA Parameters and Digital Signature Option's CGA Parameters include
   16 octet modifier, 8 octet prefix obtained from the router
   advertisement message sent from 6LBR, 1 octet collision count and 56
   octet Public Key. Digital Signature is 72 octets.  The option is 160

   octets with Padding of 7 octets.  The total message size of an
   original LSEND address registration NS message is 216 octets and such
   a message can be encapsulated into three 802.15.4 frames.

   An address registration refresh NS message contains an ARO which is
   16 octets and the digital signature option containing 16 octet key
   hash and 71 octet signature and 5 octet Padding.  The message is 152
   octets long with the header.  Such a message could be encapsulated in
   two 802.15.4 frames.


6.  Security Considerations

   The same considerations regarding the threats to the Local Link Not
   Covered (as in [RFC3971]) apply.

   The threats discussed in Section 9.2 of [RFC3971] are countered by
   the protocol described in this document as well.

   As to the attacks to the protocol itself, denial of service attacks
   that involve producing a very high number of packets are deemed
   unlikely because of the assumptions on the node capabilities in low-
   power and lossy networks.


7.  IANA considerations

   This document defines two new options to be used in neighbor
   discovery protocol messages and new type values for CGA Parameters
   and Digital Signature Option (TBA1) and Digital Signature Option
   (TBA2) need to be assigned by IANA.

   This document defines 0xE8C47FB7FD2BB885DAB2D31A0F2808B4 for LSEND
   CGA Message Type Tag.
