                        PIM-Bidir RPL Resiliency
              draft-zzhang-pim-bidir-rpl-resiliency-00.txt

Abstract

   With PIM-Bidir, the RPA does not have to be associated with a router.
   Rather, it only needs to be a routable address on a RPL (typically a
   multi-access network).  Such a scenario is commonly referred as
   Phantom RPA.  This achieves RP resiliency to some extent, because the
   "RP" will not fail.  However, if the RPL itself partitions, traffic
   converged to one partition will not be able to reach other parts of
   the network where joins converge to the other partitions of the RPL.

   This document proposes simple procedures, which does not require
   signaling extensions, to achieve RPL resiliency.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Problem Description

   The problem with partitioned RPL is that routers on the RPL still
   expect traffic to be exchanged over the RPL to reach other parts of
   the network, even though that won't happen across the RPL partitions.

   This can be illustrated by Figure 1.  The RPL is served by two
   interconnected switches and if the link between the switches breaks,
   R1~R4 will all continue to treat the link as RPL, and terminate the
   joins.  R3~4 continue to expect traffic injected by R5 to arrive on
   the RPL link, instead of sending joins to R2.

1.2.  Motivations

   The importance of ensuring traffic reachability in spite of RPL
   partitioning is obvious.  Additionally,
   [I-D.wijnands-pim-source-discovery-bsr] provides a perfect example of
   PIM-Bidir as a solution once the partitioning problem is solved.

   [I-D.wijnands-pim-source-discovery-bsr] proposes to extend BSR to
   flood source information so that routers connecting to receivers can
   send (s,g) SPT joins, bypassing the RTP->SPT switch.  It points out
   that the solution is not suitable "for applications with strong
   dependency on the initial packet(s)" and PIM-Bidir [RFC5015] should
   be used for that.  However, PIM-Bidir is not suitable where high
   resiliency is required, unless the partitioning problem is resolved.

Internet-Draft          pim-bidir-rpl-resiliency            October 2013


   [I-D.wijnands-pim-source-discovery-bsr] also raises a question
   whether BSR should be extended to a generic flooding mechanism for
   opaque information.  Due to the way BSR flooding is done, while it is
   acceptable to flood group-to-rp mapping, it becomes inefficient to
   flood large amount of data.  PIM-Bidir can be used as a generic
   protocol for efficient many-to-many data distribution and solving the
   partitioning problem enables the same level of resiliency as BSR
   flooding.

1.3.  Proposed Solutions

   This problem can be solved as follows:

   o  Routers on the RPL detect RPL partitioning, elect an active
      partition to continue function as RPL, and stop treating the
      inactive partitions as RPL.

   o  All routers route joins and traffic towards the active partition.

   For the first task, this document specifies two methods to detect RPL
   partitioning and elect an active partition.  For the second task, a
   host route to the RPA can be announced by the routers on the active
   partition.

   This solution not only addresses RPL partitioning, it can also be
   used to mitigate the impact of network partitioning (where a part of
   network may be completely separated from the rest) by intentionally
   placing RPL segments into different parts of the network, as
   illustrated on Figure 2.  This is called Anycast RPL in this
   document, because the segments will all have the same subnet.  With
   that, only one segment will be active and treated as RPL before the
   network partitions.

   When the network separates into completely disjoint partitions, see
   figure Figure 3, each partition may have their own active RPL so
   intra-partition traffic will continue to flow.  In the extreme case,
   all routers can be put onto RPL segments, making the network
   extremely resilient from PIM-Bidir point of view.

   For simplicity and practicality, this document assumes that the RPA
   does not belong to any router on the RPL.  Such a scenario is
   commonly referred as phantom RPA.  These procedures MUST NOT be used
   when the RPA is an address belonging to a router.

2.  Operations

2.1.  Modified PIM-Bidir Procedures

   A PIM router treats a link as RPL when the following two conditions
   are all met:

   o  [existing] The route towards a RPA is directly over the link

   o  [new] The router is in the elected active partition

   Note that the active partition could be the one and only "partition"
   (when there is no RPL partitioning).

   A router MUST advertise a host route to the RPA if and only if it
   treats a link as RPL.  It MUST start the DF election on the link and
   treat it as a regular link when it stops treating a link as RPL.
   When it starts treating a link as RPL, it MUST stop the DF election.

   The following sections specify two methods to detect partitioning and
   elect an active partition.  Each elected active partition is

Internet-Draft          pim-bidir-rpl-resiliency            October 2013


   identified by one of the routers, and other routers determine if they
   are in the active partition by checking their neighborship with the
   identifying router.

   The neighborship check can be done via either IGP mechanism (e.g.
   OSPF Hello) or PIM Hello (if used).  In either case, fast
   neighborship change detection SHOULD be used, e.g., via BFD or short
   Hello interval.

2.2.  Detect partitioning and elect active partition

   For the detection and election, each partition needs to be
   represented by one or more identifiers.  This can be done by two
   methods.

2.2.1.  Using Host Routes advertised by any protocol

   In each partition, routers learn of each other by way of PIM Hellos.
   Of all the neighbors, the one with the lowest routable unicast
   interface address on the subnet MUST advertise a host route to the
   address itself, e.g. via a Stub Link in the OSPF Router LSA or a BGP
   NLRI.  Optionally, to speed up convergence and facilitate make-
   before-break process, the one with the second lowest address or even
   all may do the same.

   The host routes represent all partitions, potentially with N:1
   mapping.

   Routers on the RPL subnet find all the host routes that fall into the
   RPL subnet range, and select the one with the lowest address which
   itself not RPA address.  That address identifies the active
   partition.  Whenever such a host route is added or deleted, the
   election process is rerun.

2.2.2.  Using Link State Routing protocol

   When a Link State Routing protocol is used, the link states for the
   RPL subnet can be used.  For example, with OSPF, each partition may
   have its own Network LSA for the same subnet, or in case of no
   Network LSA (there may be no DR or adjacency between the DR and a
   non-DR), each router on the partition will advertise a stub link in
   its Router LSA for the RPL subnet.  Routers on the RPL subnet check
   all the reachable Network LSAs for the subnet and reachable Router
   LSAs that have a stub link for the subnet.  The Network LSA with the
   lowest Advertising Router among all those Network LSAs, or in case of
   no Network LSAs the Router LSA with the lowest Advertising Router is
   selected to identify the active partition.  If a Network LSA is
   selected, then a router is on the active partition if and only if it



Zhang, et al.            Expires April 19, 2014                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          pim-bidir-rpl-resiliency            October 2013


   originated the Network LSA, or it is a neighbor on the subnet with
   the Advertising Router.  If a Router LSA is selected, then only the
   Advertising Router itself is on the active partition.

   Whenever a corresponding Network LSA or stub link for the RPL subnet
   is added/deleted or its reachability changes, the election process is
   rerun.

   The above procedure does not need any PIM/IGP signaling extensions,
   but only works if all the partitions are in the same area.  That is
   sufficient to address RPL partitioning, but if it is desired to put
   Anycast RPLs in different areas, then IGP signaling extension is
   needed.  Again using OSPF as an example:

   o  When an Area Border Router (ABR) advertises a Type 3 Summary LSA
      into the backbone area B from a non-backbone area A for a RPL
      subnet that it learns in area A, the Summary LSA MUST carry, in a
      TLV according to [I-D.acee-ospfv3-lsa-extend](details TBD), the
      lowest Advertising Router of the reachable Network LSAs for the
      RPL Subnet, or in case of no Network LSAs, the lowest Advertising
      Router of reachable Router LSAs that have a stub link for the RPL
      subnet, plus the LSA Type.  If the ABR belongs to multiple non-
      backbone areas and the RPL subnet is reachable in more than one of
      the areas, a single Summary LSA is originated.  In that case,
      Advertising Router and LSA Type in the TLV is set according to the
      selected LSA in the area with the lowest Area ID.

   o  When an ABR advertises a Type 3 Summary LSA into the non-backbone
      area A for a RPL subnet that it learns in the backbone area B, the
      Summary LSA MUST carry in a TLV according to
      [I-D.acee-ospfv3-lsa-extend] the Advertising Router of the LSA
      that identifies the elected active partition.  If the LSA is a
      Network LSA or Router LSA, the LSA Type in the TLV is set
      accordingly.  If it is a Summary LSA, the LSA Type is copied from
      the Summary LSA's TLV.  The LSA Type is not really used, but
      included for consistency.

   o  For the election process in the backbone area, Advertising Routers
      in the following ordered groups are compared, and the lowest
      Advertising Router in the first non-empty group is elected to
      identify the active partition.

      *  Of reachable Network LSAs for the RPL subnet

      *  Of reachable Router LSAs with stub link for the RPL subnet

      *  Carried in the above mentioned TLV of reachable Summary LSAs
         for the RPL subnet, with Network LSA type in the TLV

Internet-Draft          pim-bidir-rpl-resiliency            October 2013


      *  Carried in the above mentioned TLV of reachable Summary LSAs
         for the RPL subnet with Router LSA type in the TLV

   o  In a non-backbone area, the following group order is used instead,
      so that the partitions in the backbone area are always preferred.

      *  Carried in the above mentioned TLV of reachable Summary LSAs
         for the RPL subnet

      *  Of reachable local Network LSAs for the RPLsubnet

      *  Of reachable Router LSAs with stub link for the RPL subnet

   o  To determine if a router is on the active partition, the router
      checks if the active partition is identified by a Summary LSA.  If
      yes, the Advertising Router from the TLV is used.  Otherwise, the
      Advertising Router of the identifying Network LSA or Router LSA is
      used.  Then, the same neighborship checking as in single area case
      is done to determine if the router is on the active partition.

2.2.3.  Comparison between the two detection and election methods

   The Host Route method universally works with any routing protocol w/o
   any signaling changes, and can work across AS boundaries.  However,
   it requires advertising additional host routes, and the election is
   purely based on address comparison.

   The other method works only with Link State Routing protocols and
   only works intra-AS.  It needs IGP signaling extensions if multiple
   RPL segments need to be intentionally placed in different areas.  For
   OSPF, currently the extension is only considered for OSPFv3.  On the
   other hand, it only needs a little additional signaling for the
   intentional inter-area Anycast RPL deployment, and the election
   prefers the RPL segments in the backbone area, which may be desired.
