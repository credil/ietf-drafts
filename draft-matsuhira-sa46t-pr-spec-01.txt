Abstract

   This document specifies SA46T Prefix Resolution (SA46T-PR)
   specification.  SA46T-PR is almost same as SA46T, however method of
   generation of outer IPv6 address is defferent.  SA46T is backbone
   network based approach, however SA46T-PR is stub network based
   approch.

Internet-Draft                  SA46T-PR                       July 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document provide SA46T Prefix Resolution (SA46T-PR)
   specification.

   The basic strategy for IPv6 deployment is dual stack.  However,
   because of exhaustion of IPv4 address, there will be no IPv4
   addresses for configuring dual stack in near future.  That means
   there will be IPv6 only networks automatically.

   However, there are many IPv4 only networks still exist and those
   seems continuous use in near future.  That means methods continuous
   use of IPv4 network over IPv6 only network will be required.

   SA46T [I-D.draft-matsuhira-sa46t-spec] provide such methods.  In
   addition, SA46T-PR also provide such methots.  SA46T is backbone
   network based approach, on the other hand, SA46T-PR is stub network
   based approach.


2.  Basic Network Configuration

   Figure 1 shows network configuration with SA46T-PR.  The network
   consists of three parts, backbone network, stub network, and
   SA46T-PR.

   Backbone network can be operated with IPv6 only.  Stub network has
   three cases, IPv4 only, Dual Stack (both IPv4 and IPv6), and IPv6
   only.

   SA46T connects backbone network and stub network in case IPv4 still
   works in that stub network.  If stub network is IPv6 only, SA46T-PR
   is not needed.

3.  Basic Function of SA46T-PR

   SA46T-PR has mainly two function.  One is IPv4 over IPv6
   Encapsulation / Decapsulation, and another is generate a table where
   IPv4 stub network belong to IPv6 network.

3.1.  IPv4 over IPv6 Encapsulation / Decapsulation

   SA46T-PR excapsulates IPv4 packet to IPv6 from stub network to
   backbone network, and decapsulates IPv6 packet to IPv4 from backbone
   network to stub network.  Figure 2 shows packet format on both
   backbone network and stub network.

3.2.  SA46T-PR Address Format

   SA46T-PR address is a IPv6 address used in outer IPv6 header which
   encapsulate IPv4 packet by SA46T-PR.  Figure 3 shows SA46T-PR address
   format.

    |  96 - m bits             |         m bits         |     32 bits  |
    +--------------------------+------------------------+--------------+
    | SA46T-PR address prefix  | IPv4 network plane ID  | IPv4 address |
    +--------------------------+------------------------+--------------+

                                 Figure 3

   SA46T address consists of three parts as follows.

   SA46T-PR address prefix

      SA46T-PR address prefix is the IPv6 network prefix of stub network
      which contain IPv4 network of the IPv4 network plane.

   IPv4 network plane ID

      IPv4 network plane ID is an identifier of IPv4 network stack over
      IPv6 backbone network.

   IPv4 address

      IPv4 address in inner IPv4 packet.

3.3.  Resolving SA46T-PR address

   SA46T-PR resolve SA46T-PR address using SA46T Prefix Resolution Table
   (SA46T-PR Table).  SA46T-PR generate SA46T-PR address resolving
   SA46T-PR prefix from IPv4 network plane ID and IPv4 address.
   FigureFigure 4 show this processing.

   Figure Figure 5show SA46T-PR Table.  This table consists four parts,
   IPv4 network plane ID, IPv4 address, netmask, and SA46T-PR address
   prefix.

   SA46T-PR configured IPv4 network plane ID, so SA46T-PR know IPv4
   network plane ID value the interface belongs.

   Resolving destination address, SA46T-PR use pre-configured IPv4

   network plane ID valude, and destination address of IPv4 packets, and
   serch the SA46T-PR table.  SA46T-PR table return the SA46T-PR address
   prefix value correspoiding IPv4 network plane ID and IPv4 destination
   address.  Then SA46T-PR generate whole SA46T-PR address.

   Resolving source address, SA46T-PR already know IPv4 network plane ID
   value and IPv6 address prefix as SA46T-PR prefix.  So, searching the
   SA46T-PR table does not require for resolving source address.


4.  Mode of SA46T-PR

   SA46T-PR has two working mode, one is router mode, another is host
   mode.

4.1.  Router mode

   In router mode, SA46T-PR act as a IPv6 router.  SA46T-PR occupy IPv6
   subnet, and SA46T-PR advertise route for SA46T-PR.

4.2.  Host mode

   In host mode, SA46T-PR act as a IPv6 host.  SA46T-PR share IPv4
   subnet, that mean, SA46T-PR and IPv6 hosts exists on same IPv6
   subnet.  SA46T-PR do proxy NDP function for IPv4 host.


5.  Sample configuration

   Figure Figure 6shows sample confiuration of SA46T-PR.  In this
   example, there are three IPv4 stub network with the same IPv4 network
   plane.

6.  Comparison with SA46T

   SA46T is backbone network based approach, and SA46T-PR is stub
   network based approach.

6.1.  difference with SA46T

   SA46T require route advertisement of SA46T prefix, so additional
   route are require, however configuration is few.  On the other hand,
   SA46T-PR does not require additional route, however SA46T-PR table is
   require.

   There are such trade-off between SA46T and SA46T-PR.

6.2.  Compatibility with SA46T

   If configure SA46t-PR table with default prefix as SA46T prefix,
   SA46T-PR acts as SA46T. In this case, netmask value of SA46T-PR table
   is /0, that mean any IPv4 network plane ID and IPv4 address pair
   match this entry.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


8.  Security Considerations

   Security Considerations does not discussed in this memo.
