    <t>This document discusses which multicast addresses should be used for
      documentation purposes and reserves multicast addresses for such
      use. Some multicast addresses are derived from
      AS numbers or unicast addresses. This document also explains how
      these can be used for documentation purposes.</t> 
  </abstract>

  <section title="Introduction">
    <t>It is often useful in documentation, IETF documents, etc.,
    to provide examples containing IP multicast addresses.
    For documentation where examples of general purpose multicast addresses
    are needed, one should use multicast addresses that never will be
    assigned or in actual use. There is a risk that addresses used in
    examples may accidentally be used. It is then important that the
    same addresses are not used by other multicast applications or
    services. It may also be beneficial to filter out such addresses
    from multicast signalling and multicast data sent to such addresses.
    </t><t>
    For unicast there are both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
    reserved for this purpose,
    see <xref target="RFC5737"/> and <xref target="RFC3849"/>
    respectively. This document reserves multicast addresses for this
    purpose.
    </t>
    <t>There are also some multicast addresses that are derived from AS
    numbers or unicast addresses. For examples where such addresses are
    desired, one should derive them from the AS numbers and unicast
    addresses reserved for documentation purposes. This document also
    discusses the use of these.
</t>
  </section>
  <section title="IPv4 multicast documentation addresses">
    <t>
    For Any-Source Multicast (ASM), the IPv4 multicast addresses allocated
    for documentation purposes
    are 233.252.0.0 - 233.252.0.255 (233.252.0.0/24).
    </t>
    <t>
    For Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) it is less important which multicast
    addresses are used, since
    a host/application joins a channel identified by both source and
    group. Any source addresses used in SSM examples should be unicast
    addresses reserved for documentation purposes. There are three
    unicast address ranges provided for documentation use in
    <xref target="RFC5737"/>. The ranges are 192.0.2.0/24,
    198.51.100.0/24 and 203.0.113.0/24.
    </t>
    <t>Sometimes one wants to give examples where a specific
    type of address is desired. E.g. for text about multicast scoping,
    one might want the examples to use addresses that are to be used for
    administrative scoping. See below for guidance on how to construct
    specific types of example addresses.</t>

    <section title="Administratively scoped IPv4 multicast addresses">
      <t>Administratively scoped IPv4 multicast addresses
      <xref target="RFC2365"/> are reserved for scoped multicast. They can
      be used within a site or an organization. Apart from a small set of
      scope relative addresses, these addresses are not assigned. The high
      order /24 in every scope is reserved for relative assignments.
      A relative assignment is an integer offset from the highest address in
      the scope and represents an IPv4 address. For documentation
      purposes, the integer offset is TBD1. This provides one multicast address
      per scope.
      </t><t>
      For example in the Local Scope 239.255.0.0/16, the multicast address
      for documentation purposes is 239.255.255.255-TBD1.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="GLOP multicast addresses">
      <t>GLOP <xref target="RFC3180"/> is a method for deriving IPv4 multicast
      group addresses from 16-bit AS numbers.  For examples where GLOP
      addresses are desired, the addresses should be
      derived from the AS numbers reserved for documentation use.
      </t>
      <t>The 16-bit AS numbers reserved for documentation use in
      <xref target="RFC5398"/> are 64496 - 64511. By use of
      <xref target="RFC3180"/>, we then get 16 /24 multicast prefixes
      for documentation use. The first
      one 233.251.240.0/24, and the last 233.251.255.0/24.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Unicast prefix based IPv4 multicast addresses">
    <t>IPv4 multicast addresses can be derived from IPv4 unicast prefixes,
    see <xref target="RFC6034"/>. For examples where this type of addresses
    are desired, the addresses should be derived from the unicast addresses
    reserved for documentation purposes, see <xref target="RFC5737"/>.
    </t>
    <t>There are three unicast address ranges provided for documentation use
    in <xref target="RFC5737"/>. The ranges are 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24
    and 203.0.113.0/24. Using <xref target="RFC6034"/> this leaves us with
    the unicast prefix based IPv4 multicast addresses 234.192.0.2,
    234.198.51.100 and 234.203.0.113.</t>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section title="IPv6 multicast documentation addresses">
    <t>
      For Any-Source Multicast (ASM) the IPv6 multicast addresses allocated
      for documentation purposes are TBD2. This is a /96 prefix so that it
      can be used with group IDs according to the allocation guidelines in
      <xref target="RFC3307"/>). Also note that for these addresses the
      transient flag, the T-flag as defined in <xref target="RFC3513"/>, is
      zero. This is because they are permanently assigned. There can be no
      permanently assigned addresses for documentation purposes with the
      transient flag set to one, since the flag set to one means that they
      are not permanently assigned.
    </t>
    <t>
    For Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) it is less important which multicast
    addresses are used, since
    a host/application joins a channel identified by both source and
    group. Any source addresses used in SSM examples should be unicast
    addresses reserved for documentation purposes. The IPv6 unicast
    prefix reserved for documentation purposes is 2001:DB8::/32,
    see <xref target="RFC3849"/>.
    </t>
    <t>Sometimes one wants to give examples where a specific
    type of address is desired. E.g. for text about multicast scoping,
    one might want the examples to use addresses that are to be used for
    administrative scoping. See below for guidance on how to construct
    specific types of example addresses.</t>

    <section title="Unicast prefix based IPv6 multicast addresses">
      <t>IPv6 multicast addresses can be derived from IPv6 unicast prefixes,
      see <xref target="RFC3306"/>. For examples where this type of addresses
      is desired, the addresses should be derived from the unicast addresses
      reserved for documentation purposes.
      </t> 
      <t>The IPv6 unicast prefix reserved for documentation purposes is
      2001:DB8::/32, see <xref target="RFC3849"/>.
      This allows a wide range of different IPv6 multicast addresses. Using
      just the base /32 prefix, one gets the IPv6 multicast prefixes
      FF3X:20:2001:DB8::/64, one for each available scope X. One can also
      produce longer prefixes from this. Just as an example, one can pick
      say a /64 prefix 2001:DB8:DEAD:BEEF::/64 which gives the multicast
      prefixes FF3X:40:2001:DB8:DEAD:BEEF::/96, one for each available scope X.
      </t> 
    </section>
    <section title="Embedded-RP IPv6 multicast addresses">
      <t>There is a type of IPv6 multicast addresses called Embedded-RP
      addresses where the IPv6 address of a Rendezvous-Point is embedded
      inside the multicast address, see <xref target="RFC3956"/>.
      For examples where this type of addresses is desired, the addresses should
      be derived from the unicast addresses reserved for documentation purposes,
      see <xref target="RFC3849"/>.
      </t><t>
      For documentation purposes, the RP address can be any address from the
      range 2001:DB8::/32 that follows the constraints specified
      in <xref target="RFC3956"/>. One example address could be 2001:DB8::1.
      The embedded-RP multicast prefixes might then be
      FF7X:120:2001:DB8::/96. Another example could be the RP address
      2001:DB8:BEEF:FEED::7 which gives the prefixes
      FF7X:740:2001:DB8:BEEF:FEED::/96. See also the examples in
      <xref target="RFC3956"/>.</t>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section title="Security Considerations">
    <t>
The use of specific multicast addresses for documentation purposes has no
negative impact on security.
</t>
  </section>
  <section title="IANA Considerations">
    <t>IANA is requested to add a reference to this document for the
    IPv4 MCAST-TEST-NET allocation, so that all the different documentation
    multicast assignments reference this document.</t>

    <t>IANA is requested to assign a scope relative IPv4 address for
    documentation purposes.</t>

    <t>This paragraph contains some further instructions for IANA in order to
    clarify. It should be deleted before publishing. The string TBD1 in this
    document should be replaced by the assigned offset. Also the string
    255-TBD1 should be replaced by the value of 255 minus the assigned offset.
    The next available offset seems currently to be 10. Look in the registry
    for where it says "10-252 Reserved - To be assigned by the IANA". If the
    value 10 is chosen, then we would like to add
    "10 MCAST-TEST-NET-2 [RFCxxxx]" to
    the table. TBD1 would then be 10. TBD1 is used in two places apart from
    the IANA considerations. In one place it says just TBD1, that should
    be replaced by "10". The other place it says "239.255.255.255-TBD1".
    That should then be replaced by "239.255.255.245". In the unlikely
    event that 10 is not available, please use the first available value
    accordingly. MCAST-TEST-NET-2 is suggested here, since the existing
    allocation is named MCAST-TEST-NET.</t>

    <t>IANA is requested to assign "variable scope" IPv6 multicast addresses
    for documentation purposes. This should be a /96 prefix.</t>

    <t>This paragraph contains some further instructions for IANA in order to
    clarify. It should be deleted before publishing. The word TBD2 in this
    text should be replaced with the assigned prefix. The prefix should be
    of the form FF0X:.../96. In order to make this documentation prefix easily
    recognizable, the authors would like to request the prefix
    FF0X::DB8:0:0/96 if possible. This makes it somewhat similar to the IPv6
    unicast prefix 2001:DB8::/32. We suggest they are denoted as
    "Documentation Addresses" with a reference to this document.
