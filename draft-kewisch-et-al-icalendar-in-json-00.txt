Internet-Draft                    jCal                     November 2012


1.  Introduction

   The iCalendar data format [RFC5545] is a widely deployed interchange
   format for calendaring and scheduling data.  While many applications
   and services consume and generate calendar data, iCalendar is a
   specialized format that requires its own parser/generator.  In
   contrast, JSON-based formats as defined in [RFC4627] are the native
   format for JavaScript widgets and libraries and it is appropriate to
   have a standard form of calendar data that is easier to work with
   than iCalendar.

   The purpose of this specification is to define "jCal", a JSON format
   for iCalendar data. jCal is defined as a straightforward mapping into
   JSON from iCalendar, so that iCalendar data can be converted to JSON,
   and then back to iCalendar, without losing any semantic meaning in
   the data.  Anyone creating jCal calendar data according to this
   specification will know that their data can be converted to a valid
   iCalendar representation as well.

   The key design considerations are essentially the same as those for
   [RFC6321], that is:

      Round-tripping (converting an iCalendar instance to jCal and back)
      will give the same semantic result as the starting point.  For
      example, all components, properties and property parameters are
      guaranteed to be preserved, with the exception of those which have
      default values.

      Ordering of elements will not necessarily be preserved.

      Preserve the semantics of the iCalendar data.  While a simple
      consumer can easily browse the calendar data in jCal, a full
      understanding of iCalendar is still required in order to modify
      and/or fully comprehend the calendar data.

      Ability to handle many extensions to the underlying iCalendar
      specification without requiring an update to this document.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The underlying format used for jCal is JSON.  Consequently, the terms
   "object" and "array" as well as the four primitive types are to be
   interpreted as described in Section 1 of [RFC4627].

   Some examples in this document contain "partial" JSON documents used
   for illustrative purposes.  In these examples, three periods "..."
   are used to indicate a portion of the document that has been removed
   for compactness.

3.  Converting from iCalendar to jCal

   This section describes how iCalendar data is converted to jCal using
   a simple mapping between the iCalendar data model and JSON elements.

3.1.  Pre-processing

   iCalendar uses a line folding mechanism to limit lines of data to a
   maximum line length (typically 72 characters) to ensure maximum
   likelihood of preserving data integrity as it is transported via
   various means (e.g., email) - see Section 3.1 of [RFC5545].  Prior to
   converting iCalendar data into jCal all folded lines MUST be
   unfolded.

   iCalendar data uses an "escape" character sequence for text values
   and property parameter values.  When such text elements are converted
   into jCal the escaping MUST be removed.

   iCalendar uses a base64 encoding for binary data.  However, it does
   not restrict the encoding from being applied to non-binary value
   types.  So the following rules MUST be applied when processing a
   property with the "ENCODING" property parameter set to "BASE64":

   o  If the property value type is "BINARY", the base64 encoding MUST
      be preserved.

   o  If the value type is not "BINARY", the "ENCODING" property
      parameter MUST be removed, and the value MUST be base64 decoded.

   When base64 encoding and decoding is used, it MUST conform to Section
   4 of [RFC4648], which is the base64 method used in [RFC5545].

   One key difference in the formatting of values used in iCalendar and
   jCal is that in jCal the specification uses date/time and utc-offset
   values aligned with the complete representation, extended format of
   [ISO.8601.2004].

3.2.  iCalendar stream (RFC5545 section 3.4)

   At the top level of the iCalendar object model is an "iCalendar
   stream".  This stream encompasses multiple "iCalendar objects".  In
   jCal, the entire stream is represented by an array, where the first
   element is the string "icalendar" and subsequent elements are



Kewisch, et al.           Expires May 17, 2013                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                    jCal                     November 2012


   iCalendar objects represented as described in this section.

   In the typical case where there is only one iCalendar object,
   encapsulation inside an "icalendar" array MAY be omitted.

   An iCalendar stream can contain one or more iCalendar objects.  Each
   iCalendar object, delimited by "BEGIN:VCALENDAR" and "END:VCALENDAR",
   is represented by a fixed length array with three elements:

   1.  The string "vcalendar"

   2.  An array of jCal properties

   3.  An array of jCal components

   The representation of an iCalendar object in JSON will be named
   "vcalendar component" throughout this document.

   Example:

   ["icalendar",
     ["vcalendar",
       [ /* properties */ ],
       [ /* components */ ]
     ],
     ["vcalendar",
       [ /* properties */ ],
       [ /* components */ ]
     ],
     ...
   ]

   iCalendar objects are comprised of a set of "components",
   "properties", "parameters" and "values".  A "component" can contain
   other "components" or "properties".  A "property" has a value and a
   set of zero or more "parameters".

   An iCalendar object may contain a mix of iCalendar component types,
   for example vevent objects delimited by "BEGIN:VEVENT" and "END:
   VEVENT", task objects delimited by "BEGIN:VTODO" and "END:VTODO".

       +------------------+-------------+-------------------------+
       | Item             | jCal name   | jCal Definition         |
       +------------------+-------------+-------------------------+
       | iCalendar Stream | "icalendar" | Appendix A "jcalstream" |
       | VCALENDAR        | "vcalendar" | Appendix A "jcalobject" |

3.3.  Components (RFC5545 section 3.6)

   Each calendar component in the "VCALENDAR" object, delimited by
   "BEGIN" and "END", will be converted to a fixed length array with
   three fields that have a specific structure:

   1.  A string with the name of the iCalendar component, but in
       lowercase.

   2.  An array of jCal properties as described in Section 3.4.

   3.  An array of jCal components, representing the sub-components of
       the component in question.

   While the grouping of properties and sub-components does not retain
   the original order specified in the iCalendar stream, the semantics
   of a component are preserved.

   As an example, the table below shows iCalendar to jCal mappings for
   current iCalendar components.  Any new iCalendar components added in
   the future will be converted in the same way.

               +-----------+-----------+-------------------+
               | Component | jCal name | RFC5545 Section   |
               +-----------+-----------+-------------------+
               | VEVENT    | vevent    | [RFC5545] # 3.6.1 |
               | VTODO     | vtodo     | [RFC5545] # 3.6.2 |
               | VJOURNAL  | vjournal  | [RFC5545] # 3.6.3 |
               | VFREEBUSY | vfreebusy | [RFC5545] # 3.6.4 |
               | VTIMEZONE | vtimezone | [RFC5545] # 3.6.5 |
               | STANDARD  | standard  | [RFC5545] # 3.6.5 |
               | DAYLIGHT  | daylight  | [RFC5545] # 3.6.5 |
               | VALARM    | valarm    | [RFC5545] # 3.6.6 |
               +-----------+-----------+-------------------+

   Example:

   ["vevent",
     [ /* Array of jCal properties */ ],
     [ /* Array of jCal sub-components */ ]
   ]

3.4.  Properties (RFC5545 section 3.7 and 3.8)

   iCalendar properties, whether they apply to the "VCALENDAR" object or
   to a component, are handled in a consistent way in the jCal format.

   Each individual iCalendar property is represented in jCal by an array



Kewisch, et al.           Expires May 17, 2013                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                    jCal                     November 2012


   with three fixed elements, followed by at one or more additional
   elements, depending on if the property is a multi-value property as
   described in Section 3.1.2 of [RFC5545].

   The array consists of the following fixed elements:

   1.  The name of the property as a string, but in lowercase.

   2.  An object containing the parameters as described in Section 3.5.

   3.  The type identifier string of the value, in lowercase.

   The remaining elements of the array are used for the value of the
   property.  For single-value properties, the array MUST have exactly
   four elements, for multi-valued properties as described in
   Section 3.4.1.1 there can be any number of additional elements.

   The array describing the property can then be inserted into the array
   designated for properties in any component, including the "vcalendar"
   component described in Section 3.3.

   Example:

   ["vevent",
     [
       ["summary", {}, "text", "Meeting with Fred"],
       ["categories", {}, "text", "Meetings", "Work"]
       ...
     ],
     [ /* sub-components */ ]
   ]

   The property parameters in the second element of the property array
   associate a set of parameter names with their respective value.
   Parameters are further described in Section 3.5.

   To allow for a cleaner implementation, the parameter object MUST be
   present even if there are no parameters.  In this case, an empty
   object MUST be used.

   As an example, the table below shows iCalendar to jCal mappings for
   current iCalendar properties.  Any new iCalendar properties added in
   the future will be converted in the same way.

3.4.1.  Special Cases for Properties

   This section describes some properties that have special handling
   when converting to jCal.

3.4.1.1.  Multi-valued Properties (RFC5545 Section 3.1.2)

   The following iCalendar properties can have values that consist of a
   list of "standard" iCalendar values separated by a specific
   delimiter.  In jCal these properties are added as further members of
   the array describing the property.

            +------------+------------+----------------------+
            | Property   | jCal name  | RFC5545 Section      |
            +------------+------------+----------------------+
            | CATEGORIES | categories | [RFC5545] # 3.8.1.2  |
            | RESOURCES  | resources  | [RFC5545] # 3.8.1.10 |
            | FREEBUSY   | freebusy   | [RFC5545] # 3.8.2.6  |
            | EXDATE     | exdate     | [RFC5545] # 3.8.5.1  |
            | RDATE      | rdate      | [RFC5545] # 3.8.5.2  |
            +------------+------------+----------------------+

3.4.1.2.  GEO Property (RFC5545 Section 3.8.1.6)

   In iCalendar, the "GEO" property value is defined as a semi-colon
   separated list of two "FLOAT" values, the first representing latitude
   and the second longitude.

   In jCal, the value for the "geo" property is represented like a
   multi-value property.  The first value of the property represents the
   latitude, the second value represents the longitude.

   When converting from jCal to iCalendar, the two values MUST be
   converted using a semi-colon as the separator character.

   Example

   ["vevent",
     [
       ["geo", {}, "float", 37.386013, -122.082932 ]
       ...
     ],
     ...
   ]

Internet-Draft                    jCal                     November 2012


3.4.1.3.  REQUEST-STATUS Property (RFC5545 Section 3.8.8.3)

   In iCalendar, the "REQUEST-STATUS" property value is defined as a
   semi-colon separated list of two or three "TEXT" values.  The first
   represents a code, the second a description, and the third any
   additional data.

   In jCal, the value for the "request-status" property is represented
   like a multi-value property.  The first value of the property
   corresponds to the code, the second value corresponds to the
   description and the third value corresponds to the additional data.
   Each value is represented using a string value.  If there is no
   additional data in the iCalendar value, the last element of the array
   SHOULD NOT be present.

   When converting from jCal to iCalendar, the two or three values MUST
   be converted using a semi-colon as the separator character.

   Example:

   ["vevent":
     [
       ["request-status", {}, "text", "2.0", "Success" ],
       ["request-status", {}, "text",
          "3.7",
          "Invalid Calendar User",
          "ATTENDEE:mailto:jsmith@example.org"
       ],
       ...
     ],
     ...
   ]

3.5.  Parameters (RFC5545 section 3.2)

   Property parameters are represented as a JSON object where each key-
   value pair represents the iCalendar parameter name and its value.
   The name of the parameter MUST be in lowercase, the original case of
   the parameter value MUST be preserved.

   Each individual iCalendar property parameter is represented in jCal
   by a key-value pair in the parameters object.  The key uses the same
   name as the iCalendar property parameter, but in lowercase.  For
   example, the "PARTSTAT" property parameter is represented in jCal by
   the "partstat" key.  The case of the parameter value MUST be
   preserved.

   current iCalendar parameters.  Any new iCalendar parameters added in
   the future will be converted in the same way.

3.5.1.  VALUE parameter

   iCalendar defines a "VALUE" property parameter (Section 3.2.20 of
   [RFC5545]).  This property parameter MUST NOT be added to the
   parameters object.  Instead, the value type is always explicitly
   mentioned in the third element of the array describing the property.
   Thus, when converting from iCalendar to jCal, any "VALUE" property
   parameters are skipped.  When converting from jCalendar into
   iCalendar, the appropriate "VALUE" property parameter MUST be
   included in the iCalendar property if the value type is not the
   default value type for that property.

3.5.2.  Open Issues (to be removed prior to publication as an RFC)

   How should multi-value parameters like DELEGATED-TO be handled?

   a.  Use an array for all parameters:

          Example: { "foo": ["bar"] } and { "foo": ["bar", "baz"] }

          Pro: Consistent data type for the value of the parameter
          object

          Con: Most parameters are single-value, additional array has
          performance impact for large JSON streams

   b.  Use a string for single-value properties, an array for multi-
       value properties

          Example: { "foo": "bar" } and { "foo": ["bar", "baz"] }

          Pro: Allows maximum flexibility

          Con: Requires client code to check for the type of the object
          value

   c.  Use the string, unparsed

          Example: { "foo": "bar" } and { "foo": "\"bar\", \"baz\"" }

          Pro: Consistent data type for the value of the parameter
          object

          Pro: No performance impact from additional objects

Internet-Draft                    jCal                     November 2012


          Con: Client code needs an extra helper method to take apart
          multi-value parameters

3.6.  Values (RFC5545 section 3.3)

   The type of an iCalendar value is explicitly mentioned in the third
   element of the array describing a jCal property.  The actual values
   of the property can be found in the fourth and following elements of
   the array.

3.6.1.  Binary (RFC5545 section 3.3.1)

   Description:  iCalendar "BINARY" property values are represented by a
      property with type identifier "binary".  The value is base64
      encoded data, conforming to Section 4 of [RFC4648], which is the
      base64 method used in [RFC5545].

   Example:

   ...
   ["attach", {}, "binary", "SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh"],
   ...

3.6.2.  Boolean  (RFC5545 section 3.3.2)

   Description:  iCalendar "BOOLEAN" property values are represented by
      a property with the type identifier "binary".  The value is a
      boolean JSON value.

   Example:

   ...
   ["x-non-smoking", {}, "boolean", true],
   ...

3.6.3.  Calendar User Address (RFC5545 section 3.3.3)

   Description:  iCalendar "CAL-ADDRESS" property values are represented
      by a property with the type identifier "cal-address".  The value
      is a string with the URI as described in [RFC3986].

   Example:

   ...
   ["attendee", {}, "cal-address", "mailto:kewisch@example.com"],

3.6.4.  Date (RFC5545 section 3.3.4)

   Description:  iCalendar "DATE" property values are represented by a
      property with the type identifier "date".  The value is the same
      date value specified by [RFC5545], but formatted using the
      [ISO.8601.2004] complete representation, extended format.  The
      textual format specifies a four-digit year, two-digit month, and
      two-digit day of the month, separated by the "-" character.

   Example:

   ...
   ["dtstart", {}, "date", "2011-05-17"],
   ...

3.6.5.  Date-Time (RFC5545 section 3.3.5)

   Description:  iCalendar "DATE-TIME" property values are represented
      by a property with the type identifier "date-time".  The value is
      the same date value specified by [RFC5545], but formatted using
      the [ISO.8601.2004] complete representation, extended format.  The
      same restrictions with respect to leap seconds and timezone
      offsets as specified in [RFC5545] Section 3.3.5 apply.

   Example:

   ...
   ["dtstart", {}, "date-time", "2012-10-17T12:00:00"],
   ["dtstamp", {}, "date-time", "2012-10-17T12:00:00Z"],
   ["dtend",
    { "tzid": "Europe/Berlin" },
    "date-time",
    "2011-10-17T13:00:00"
   ],
   ...

3.6.6.  Duration (RFC5545 section 3.3.6)

   Description:  iCalendar "DURATION" property values are represented by
      a property with the type identifier "duration".  The value is the
      same duration value specified by [RFC5545] as a string.

   Example:

   ...
   ["duration", {}, "duration", "P1D"],

3.6.7.  Float (RFC5545 section 3.3.7)

   Description:  iCalendar "FLOAT" property values are represented by a
      property with the type identifier "float".  The value is the
      floating point number as a JSON primitive number value.

   Example:

   ...
   ["x-grade", {}, "float", 1.3],
   ...

3.6.8.  Integer (RFC5545 section 3.3.8)

   Description:  iCalendar "INTEGER" property values are represented by
      a property with the type identifier "integer".  The value is the
      floating point number as a JSON primitive number value.

   Examples:

   ...
   ["percent-complete", {}, "integer", 42],
   ...

3.6.9.  Period of Time (RFC5545 section 3.3.9)

   Description:  iCalendar "PERIOD" property values are represented by a
      property with the type identifier "period".  The value is the same
      period value specified by [RFC5545] as a string.  Any date or
      date-time values contained in the period value MUST be formatted
      in accordance to the rules for date or date-time values.

   Example:

   ...
   ["freebusy",
    { "fbtype": "FREE" },
    "period",
    "1997-03-08T16:00:00Z/P1D"

   Description:  iCalendar "RECUR" property values are represented by a
      property with the type identifier "recur".  The value is the same
      value specified by [RFC5545] as a string.

   Example:

   ...
   ["rrule", {}, "recur", "FREQ=YEARLY;COUNT=5;BYDAY-1SU;BYMONTH=10"],
   ...

3.6.11.  Text (RFC5545 section 3.3.11)

   Description:  iCalendar "TEXT" property values are represented by a
      property with the type identifier "text".  The value is the same
      text value specified by [RFC5545] as a string.

   Example:

   ...
   ["comment", {}, "text", "hello, world"],
   ...

3.6.12.  Time (RFC5545 section 3.3.12)

   Description:  iCalendar "TIME" property values are represented by a
      property with the type identifier "time".  The value is the same
      date value specified by [RFC5545], but formatted using the
      [ISO.8601.2004] complete representation, extended format.  The
      same restrictions with respect to leap seconds, time fractions,
      and timezone offsets as specified in [RFC5545] Section 3.3.12
      apply.

   Example:

   ...

   ["tzurl", {}, "uri", "http://example.org/tz/Europe-Berlin.ics"],
   ...

3.6.14.  UTC Offset (RFC5545 section 3.3.14)

   Description:  iCalendar "UTC-OFFSET" property values are represented
      by a property with the type identifier "utc-offset".  The value is
      a string with the same UTC offset value specified by [RFC5545],
      with the exception that the hour and minute components are
      separated by a ":" character, for consistency with the
      [ISO.8601.2004] timezone offset, extended format.

   Example:

   ...
   ["tzoffsetfrom", {}, "utc-offset", "-05:00"],
   ["tzoffsetto", {}, "utc-offset", "+12:45"],
   ..


3.7.  Extensions

   iCalendar extension properties and property parameters (those with an
   "X-" prefix in their name) are handled in the same way as other
   properties and property parameters: the property is represented by an
   array, the property parameter represented by an object.  The property
   or parameter name uses the same name as for the iCalendar extension,
   but in lowercase.  For example, the "X-FOO" property in iCalendar
   turns into the "x-foo" jCal property.  See Section 5 for how to deal
   with default values for unrecognized extension properties or property
   parameters.

4.  Converting from jCal into iCalendar

   When converting component, property and property parameter values,
   the names SHOULD be converted to uppercase.  Although iCalendar names
   are case insensitive, common practice is to keep them all uppercase
   following the actual definitions in [RFC5545].

   Backslash escaping and line folding MUST be applied to the resulting
   iCalendar data as required by [RFC5545].

   Non-binary value types MUST NOT be base64 encoded.

   jCal properties that do not specify the default type for the

Internet-Draft                    jCal                     November 2012


   iCalendar property MUST add a VALUE parameter when converting to
   iCalendar. jCal properties that specify the default type SHOULD NOT
   add a VALUE parameter.

5.  Handling Unrecognized Properties or Parameters

   In iCalendar, properties have a default value type specified by their
   definition, e.g.  "SUMMARY"'s value type is "TEXT" and "DURATION"'s
   is "DURATION".  When a property uses its default value type, the
   "VALUE" property parameter does not need to be specified on the
   property.

   When new properties are defined or "X-" properties used, an iCalendar
   to jCal converter might not recognize them, and not know what the
   appropriate default value types are, yet they need to be able to
   preserve the values.  A similar issue arises for unrecognized
   property parameters.  As a result, the following rules are applied
   when dealing with unrecognized properties and property parameters:

   o  When converting iCalendar into jCal:

      *  Any property that does not include a "VALUE" property parameter
         and whose default value type is not known, MUST be converted to
         a string object.  The content of that string is the unprocessed
         value text.

      *  Any unrecognized property parameter MUST be converted to a
         string value, with its content set to the property parameter
         value text, treated as if it were a "TEXT" value.

   o  When converting jCal into iCalendar:

      *  Since jCal always explicitly specifies the value type, it can
         always be converted to iCalendar using the VALUE parameter.

      *  If the value type specified in jCal matches the default value
         type in iCalendar, the VALUE parameter SHOULD be omitted.

   Example: The following is an example of an unrecognized iCalendar
   property (that uses a "DATE-TIME" value as its default), and the
   equivalent jCal representation of that property.

   iCalendar:

   X-PROPERTY:20110512T120000Z

   jCal:

   ...
   ["x-property", {}, "text", "20110512T120000Z"],
   ...

   Example: The following is an example of a jCal property (where the
   corresponding iCalendar property uses a "INTEGER" value as its
   default), and the equivalent iCalendar representation of that
   property.

   jCal:

   ...
   ["percent-complete", {}, "integer", 95],
   ...

   iCalendar:

   PERCENT-COMPLETE:95

   Example: The following is an example of an unrecognized iCalendar
   property parameter (that uses a "FLOAT" value as its default)
   specified on a recognized iCalendar property, and the equivalent jCal
   representation of that property and property parameter.

   iCalendar:

   DTSTART;X-PARAM=30.3;VALUE=DATE:20110512

   jCal:

   ...
   ["dtstart", { "x-param": "30.3" }, "date", "2011-05-12"],
   ...

6.  Security Considerations

   For security considerations specific to calendar data, see Section 7
   of [RFC5545].  Since this specification is a mapping from iCalendar,
   no new security concerns are introduced related to calendar data.

   The use of JSON as a format does have security risks.  Section 7 of
   [RFC4627] discusses these risks.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a MIME media type for use with iCalendar in
   JSON data.

   Type name:  application

   Subtype name:  calendar+json

   Required parameters:  none

   Optional parameters:  method, component and optinfo as defined for
      the text/calendar media type in [RFC5545].

   Encoding considerations:  Same as encoding considerations of
      application/json as specified in [RFC4627].

   Security considerations:  See Section 6.

   Interoperability considerations:  This media type provides an
      alternative format for iCalendar data based on JSON.

   Published specification:  This specification.

   Applications which use this media type:  Applications that currently
      make use of the text/calendar media type can use this as an
      alternative.

   Person & email address to contact for further information:
      calsify@ietf.org

   Intended usage:  COMMON

   Restrictions on usage:  There are no restrictions on where this media
      type can be used.

   Author:  See the "Author's Address" section of this document.

   Change controller:  IETF

7.1.  Open Issues (to be removed prior to publication as an RFC)

   Should this document even register a MIME type?

      Pro: Doing so is in line with what some other specs do

Internet-Draft                    jCal                     November 2012


      Pro: Its easier to identify JSON data that contains only calendar
      data

      Con: Calendar data is easily identifiable by ["icalendar", ...

      Con: The underlying format is JSON, no need for special handling

8.  Acknowledgments
