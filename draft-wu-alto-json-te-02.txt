ALTO Extensions for Traffic Engineering (TE) performance metrics in JSON
                                 format

Abstract

   Cost metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic
   Optimization (ALTO).  It is used in both the Cost Map Service and the
   Endpoint Cost Service.  However the base protocol defines only a
   single cost metric, i.e., the generic "routingcost" metric (Sec. 14.2
   of ALTO base specification [ALTO]).  In practice, applications may
   request network information on other cost (including performance)
   metrics.

   In this document, we define five new base metrics which are delay,
   jitter, pktloss (packet loss), bandwidth and hopcount.  These base
   metrics are further extended with these nine new metrics linkdelay,
   linkjitter, linkloss, maxbw (Maximum Bandwidth), maxreservbw (Maximum
   Reserved Bandwdith), unreservbw (Unreserved Bandwidth), residuebw
   (Residual Bandwidth), availbw (Available Bandwidth), and utilbw
   (Utilized Bandwidth).  Also a new parameter anomalousstate is added.
   These fourteen cost metrics are derived from OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE and
   can be either used as constraint attribute associated with
   'routingcost' cost metric attribute or used as returned Cost metrics
   in the response, or both and hence provide a relatively comprehensive
   set of cost metrics for ALTO.

Internet-Draft              JSON for ALTO TE                October 2013


1.  Introduction

   The ALTO protocol [ALTO] uses a REST-ful design , and encodes its
   requests and responses using JSON [RFC4627] .  In ALTO architecture
   [ALTO], the ALTO server allows alto information to be gathered from
   multiple systems(e.g., routing protocol).  [OSPF-TE], [ISIS-TE],
   [BGP-LS] and [BGP-PM]describes extensions to routing protocol, that
   can be used to distribute network performance information (such as
   link delay, delay variation, packet loss, residual bandwidth, and
   available bandwidth).  The mechanism defined in [OSPF-TE], [ISIS-TE],
   [BGP-LS], and [BGP-PM]can be used by an ALTO Server to retrieve the
   necessary performance information supplementing the prefix and
   network topology data gathered from other sources (such as Path
   Computation Element (PCE)) in the underlying network.

   Cost metric is a basic concept in ALTO.  It is used in both the Cost
   Map Service and the Endpoint Cost Service.  However the base protocol
   defines only a single cost metric, i.e., the generic "routingcost"
   metric (Sec. 14.2 of [ALTO]).  In practice, applications may request
   network information on other cost (such as performance) metrics.  In
   this document, we define five new base metrics which are delay,
   jitter, pktloss (packet loss), bandwidth and hopcount.  These base
   metrics are further extended with these nine new metrics linkdelay,
   linkjitter, linkloss, maxbw (Maximum Bandwidth), maxreservbw (Maximum
   Reserved Bandwdith), unreservbw (Unreserved Bandwidth), residuebw
   (Residual Bandwidth), availbw (Available Bandwidth), and utilbw
   (Utilized Bandwidth).  Also a new parameter anomalousstate is added.
   These fourteen cost metrics are derived from [OSPF-TE] and [ISIS-TE]
   and can be either used as constraint attribute associated with
   'routingcost' cost metric attribute or used as returned Cost metrics
   in the response, or both and hence provide a relatively comprehensive
   set of cost metrics for ALTO.

   The introduction of a set of cost metrics allows us to extend the
   flexibility of ALTO services.  In particular, both the Cost Map
   Service and the Endpoint Cost Service allow filtering.  However,
   these two services as defined in the base protocol are limited in
   that the output information metric and the filtering (constraint)
   metric must be the same.  However, applications may request a
   filtered "routingcost" Cost Map only for locations where the delay is
   below a threshold.  This is not feasible in the ALTO base protocol.
   We discuss the overhead of implementing the aforementioned use case
   using the current base protocol, and propose a simple but effective
   extension to the "constraint" syntax to ALTO.

3.  Cost Metric Extensions: Cost Metrics

3.1.  Cost Metric: delay

Cost Metric name:  delay

Metric Description:  To specify the average delay over a configurable
          interval for each source/destination pair between two
          endpoints (network locations) in the network. It could be
          either end to end delay or the delay associated with the
          link (linkdelay). The unit is microseconds.

Cost Metric Value type:
           A single 'JSONNumber' type value containing an integer
           component that may be prefixed with an optional minus
           sign, which may be followed by a fraction part and/or
           an exponent part.

Purpose: This is intended to be a new cost metric. It could be
used as a cost metric constraint attribute used together with cost
metric attribute 'routingcost' or on its own or as a returned cost
metric in the response.

Cost mode:  A Cost Mode is encoded as a US-ASCII string.
The string MUST either have the value 'numerical' or 'ordinal'.

Measurement timing: Gather and update at the configurable interval
if it is link attribute. See [OSPF-TE] for configurable
interval. The configurable interval for end to end delay could
be same as link.

Measurement points with Potential Measurement Domain:
The measurement point could be at any endpoint between
source and destination in the network.

3.4.  Cost Metric: Bandwidth

  Cost Metric name:  bandwidth

  Metric Description:  To specify Bandwidth over a configurable
            interval for each source/destination pair between
            two endpoints (network locations)in the network.
            It could be either aggregated bandwidth for end to end
            path or the bandwidth associated with a link. The units
            are bytes per second.

  Cost Metric Value type:
            A single 'JSONNumber' type value containing an integer
            component that may be prefixed with an optional minus
            sign, which may be followed by a fraction part and/or
            an exponent part.

  Purpose: This is intended to be a constraint attribute value
  It could be used as a cost metric constraint attribute used
  together with cost metric attribute 'routingcost' or on its
  own or as a returned cost metric in the response.

  Cost mode:  A Cost Mode is encoded as a US-ASCII string.
  The string MUST either have the value 'numerical' or 'ordinal'.

  This is just a definition of the costtype 'bandwidth'. The use of
  this cost is always in conjunction with what it represents, which
  could be Max Bandwidth (maxbw), Residual Bandwidth (residuebw) etc.

  Examples: (based on Residual Bandwidth (residuebw))

3.5.  Cost Metric: Hopcount

  Cost Metric name:  hopcount

  Metric Description:  To specify the number of hops in the path
            between the source endpoint and the destination
           endpoint.

  Editor Note: Need to specify which layer (IP perhaps), details TBD for
  multiple-layer aspect.

  Cost Metric Value type:
          A single 'JSONNumber' type value containing an
          integer component that may be prefixed with an
          optional minus sign.

  Purpose: This is intended to be a constraint attribute value
  It could be used as a cost metric constraint attribute used
  together with cost metric attribute 'routingcost' or on its
  own or as a returned cost metric in the response.

  Cost mode:  A Cost Mode is encoded as a US-ASCII string.
  string MUST either have the value 'numerical' or 'ordinal'.

   and defined as:

   Object {
   BWType     max;
   [LinkName  link-name;]
   [JSONBool linkstate;] //TRUE = not steady; FALSE = steady;

4.  Cost Metric Extensions: Parameters

   The following sections define Parameters used within cost metrics
   specified in the section 3.

4.1.  Parameter: anomalousstate


  Parameter name:  anomalousstate

  Purpose:  Optinally used in a prefixed cost metric to
            indicate whether it is steady state
            of the performance metric.

  Description:  This state can be used to notify to the ALTO
        client if the performance metric associated is in a
        steady state. The ALTO client may use this to perform
        some action. The anomalousstate
        is set when the measured value of this parameter exceeds
        its configured maximum threshold.  The anomalousstate is
        cleared when the measured value falls below its
        configured threshold. Anomalousstate should be used
        together with Cost metric we defined in the
        section 3. Cost Metrics prefixed with 'a:' are
        reserved for cost metric that does not have steady state
        network performance. Cost Metrics without prefix 'a:'
        indicate the cost metric has steady state network
        performance.

Appendix A.  Filtering constraint Extensions

   Section 10.2.2.3 of "ALTO: Application Layer Traffic Optimization
   Protocol" [I.D-ietf-alto-protocol] states:
   "
   object {
        CostType   cost-type;
        [JSONString constraints<0..*>;]
        [PIDFilter  pids;]
      } ReqFilteredCostMap;

   object {
        PIDName srcs<0..*>;
        PIDName dsts<0..*>;
      } PIDFilter;

   with members:

   cost-type  The CostType (Section 9.7) for the returned costs.  The
   cost-metric and cost-mode fields MUST match one of the supported
   Cost Types indicated in this resource's capabilities
   (Section 10.2.2.4).  The ALTO Client SHOULD omit the description
   field, and if present, the ALTO Server MUST ignore the description
   field.

   constraints  Defines a list of additional constraints on which
   elements of the Cost Map are returned.  This parameter MUST NOT be
   specified if this resource's capabilities ( Section 10.2.2.4)
   indicate that constraint support is not available.  A constraint
   contains two entities separated by whitespace: (1) an operator,
    'gt' for greater than, 'lt' for less than, 'ge' for greater than
   or equal to, 'le' for less than or equal to, or 'eq' for equal to;
   (2) a target cost value.  The cost value is a number that MUST be
   defined in the same units as the Cost Metric indicated by the
   cost-metric parameter.  ALTO Servers SHOULD use at least IEEE 754
   double-precision floating point [IEEE.754.2008] to store the cost
   value, and SHOULD perform internal computations using double-
   precision floating-point arithmetic.  If multiple 'constraint'
   parameters are specified, they are interpreted as being related to
   each other with a logical AND.
   "

   In the JSON Object of type ReqFilteredCostMap, the constraint
   attribute is expressed as:

   "
   [gt | lt | ge | le | eq ] <value>
   "

Internet-Draft              JSON for ALTO TE                October 2013


   In this specification, the constraint attribute is changed to

      "
   <cost-type2>  [gt | lt | ge | le | eq ] <value>
      "

   Accordingly, the constraints definition is changed to:

  "
  constraints  Defines a list of additional constraints on which
  elements of the Cost Map are returned.  This parameter MUST NOT be
  specified if this resource's capabilities ( Section 10.2.2.4)
  indicate that constraint support is not available.  A constraint
  contains three entities separated by whitespace: (1)an cost type
  is by default cost-type in the JSON Object of type ReqFilteredCostMap.
  In addition, it could be another cost-type used for the returned cost
  (2) an operator, 'gt' for greater than, 'lt' for less than, 'ge' for
  greater than or equal to, 'le' for less than or equal to, or 'eq' for
  equal to; (3) a target cost value.  The cost value is a number that
  MUST be defined in the same units as the Cost Metric indicated by the
  cost-metric parameter.  ALTO Servers SHOULD use at least IEEE 754
  double-precision floating point [IEEE.754.2008] to store the cost
  value, and SHOULD perform internal computations using double-
  precision floating-point arithmetic.  If multiple 'constraint'
  parameters are specified, they are interpreted as being related to
  each other with a logical AND.
  "

   Editor-Notes: Filtering constraint extension should move to another
   document defining multi-metrics filtering in the future.
