    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a framework comprised of a number of
      scenarios and associated requirements for pseudowire (PW) redundancy. A
      set of redundant PWs is configured between provider edge (PE) nodes in
      single -segment PW applications, or between terminating PE (T-PE) nodes
      in multi-segment PW applications. In order for the PE/T-PE nodes to
      indicate the preferred PW to use for forwarding PW packets to one
      another, a new PW status is required to indicate the preferential
      forwarding status of active or standby for each PW in the redundancy
      set.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The objective of PW redundancy is to enable redundant attachment
      circuits (ACs), provider edge nodes (PEs), and pseudowires (PWs) to
      eliminate single points of failure in the path of an emulated service.
      This is achieved while ensuring that only one active path exists between
      a pair of customer edge nodes (CEs).</t>

      <t>In single-segment PW (SS-PW) applications, protection for the PW is
      provided by the packet switched network (PSN) layer. This may be a
      resource reservation protocol with traffic engineering (RSVP-TE) labeled
      switched path (LSP) with a fast-reroute (FRR) backup or an end-to-end
      backup LSP. It is assumed that these mechanisms can restore PSN
      connectivity rapidly enough to avoid triggering protection by PW
      redundancy. PSN protection mechanisms cannot protect against the failure
      of a PE node or the failure of the remote AC. Typically, this is
      supported by dual-homing a customer edge (CE) node to different PE nodes
      which provide a pseudowire emulated service across the PSN. A set of PW
      mechanisms is therefore required that enables a primary and one or more
      backup PWs to terminate on different PE nodes.</t>

      <t>In multi-segment PW (MS-PW) applications, PSN protection mechanisms
      cannot protect against the failure of a switching PE (S-PE). A set of
      mechanisms that support the operation of a primary and one or more
      backup PWs via a different set of S-PEs is therefore required. The paths
      of these PWs are diverse in the sense that they are switched at
      different S-PE nodes.</t>

      <t>In both of these applications, PW redundancy is important to maximise
      the resiliency of the emulated service.</t>

      <t>This document describes the framework for these applications and its
      associated operational requirements. The framework utilizes a new PW
      status, called the Preferential Forwarding Status of the PW. This is
      separate from the operational states defined in RFC4447 <xref
      target="RFC4447"></xref>. The mechanisms for PW redundancy are modeled
      on general protection switching principles.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Up PW: A PW which has been configured (label mapping exchanged
          between PEs) and is not in any of the PW defect states specified in
          <xref target="RFC4447"></xref>. Such a PW is is available for
          forwarding traffic.</t>

          <t>Down PW: A PW that has either not been fully configured, or has
          been configured and is in any one of the PW defect states specified
          in <xref target="RFC4447"></xref>. Such a PW is not available for
          forwarding traffic.</t>

          <t>Active PW: An UP PW used for forwarding user, OAM and control
          plane traffic.</t>

          <t>Standby PW: An UP PW that is not used for forwarding user traffic
          but may forward OAM and specific control plane traffic.</t>

          <t>PW Endpoint: A PE where a PW terminates on a point where native
          service processing is performed, e.g., A single-segment PW (SS-PW)
          PE, a multi-segment pseudowire (MS-PW) terminating PE (T-PE), or a
          hierarchical VPLS MTU-s or PE-rs.</t>

          <t>Primary PW: The PW which a PW endpoint activates (i.e. uses for
          forwarding) in preference to any other PW when more than one PW
          qualifies for the active state. When the primary PW comes back up
          after a failure and qualifies for the active state, the PW endpoint
          always reverts to it. The designation of primary is performed by
          local configuration for the PW at the PE and is only required when
          revertive behaviour is used.</t>

          <t>Secondary PW: When it qualifies for the active state, a secondary
          PW is only selected if no primary PW is configured or if the
          configured primary PW does not qualify for active state (e.g., is
          DOWN). By default, a PW in a redundancy PW set is considered
          secondary. There is no revertive mechanism among secondary PWs.</t>

          <t>Revertive protection switching: Traffic will be carried by the
          primary PW if it is UP and a wait-to-restore timer expires and the
          primary PW is made the active PW.</t>

          <t>Non-revertive protection switching: Traffic will be carried by
          the last PW selected as a result of previous active PW entering the
          operationally DOWN state.</t>

          <t>Manual selection of a PW: The ability to manually select the
          primary/secondary PWs.</t>

          <t>MTU-s: A hierarchical virtual private LAN service multi-tenant
          unit switch, as defined in RFC4762 <xref
          target="RFC4762"></xref>.</t>

          <t>PE-rs: A hierarchical virtual private LAN service switch, as
          defined in RFC4762.</t>

          <t>n-PE: A network facing provider edge node, as defined in RFC4026
          <xref target="RFC4026"></xref>.</t>
        </list></t>

      both PEs as per RFC3985<xref target="RFC3985"></xref> and T-PEs as per
      RFC5659 <xref target="RFC5659"></xref>.</t>

      <section title="PW Redundancy Network Reference Scenarios">
        <t>This section presents a set of reference scenarios for PW
        redundancy.</t>

        <section title="Single Multi-Homed CE">
          <t>The following figure illustrates an application of single segment
          pseudowire redundancy. This scenario is designed to protect the
          emulated service against a failure of one of the PEs or ACs attached
          to the multi-homed CE. Protection against failures of the PSN
          tunnels is provided using PSN mechanisms such as MPLS fast reroute,
          so that these failures do not impact the PW.</t>

          <t>CE1 is dual-homed to PE1 and PE3. A dual homing control protocol,
          the details of which are outside the scope of this document, selects
          which AC CE1 should use to forward towards the PSN, and which PE
          (PE1 or PE3) should forward towards CE1.</t>

            </figure>In this scenario, only one of the PWs should be used for
          forwarding between PE1 / PE3, and PE2. PW redundancy determines
          which PW to make active based on the forwarding state of the ACs so
          that only one path is available from CE1 to CE2.</t>

          <t>Consider the example where the AC from CE1 to PE1 is initially
          active and the AC from CE1 to PE3 is initially standby. PW1 is made
          active and PW2 is made standby in order to complete the path to
          CE2.</t>

          <t>On failure of the AC between CE1 and PE1, the forwarding state of
          the AC on PE3 transitions to Active. The preferential forwarding
          state of PW2 therefore needs to become active, and PW1 standby, in
          order to reestablish connectivity between CE1 and CE2. PE3 therefore
          uses PW2 to forward towards CE2, and PE2 uses PW2 instead of PW1 to
          forward towards CE1. PW redundancy in this scenario requires that
          the forwarding status of the ACs at PE1 and PE3 be signaled to PE2
          so that PE2 can choose which PW to make active.</t>

          <t>Changes occurring on the dual-homed side of the network due to a
          failure of the AC or PE are not propagated to the ACs on the other
          side of the network. Furthermore, failures in the PSN are not
          propagated to the attached CEs.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Multiple Multi-Homed CEs">
          <t>This scenario, illustrated in <xref
          target="multi-multi-homed-ces"></xref>, is also designed to protect
          the emulated service against failures of the ACs and failures of the
          PEs. Both CE1 and CE2, are dual-homed to their respective PEs, PE1
          and PE2, and PE3 and PE4. The method used by the CEs to choose which
          AC to use to forward traffic towards the PSN is determined by a
          dual-homing control protocol. The details of this protocol are
          outside the scope of this document.</t>

          <t>Note that the PSN tunnels are not shown in this figure for
          clarity. However, it can be assumed that each of the PWs shown is
          encapsulated in a separate PSN tunnel. Protection against failures
          of the PSN tunnels is provided using PSN mechanisms such as MPLS
          fast reroute, so that these failures do not impact the PW.</t>

          <t>PW1 and PW4 connect PE1 to PE3 and PE4, respectively. Similarly,
          PW2 and PW3 connect PE2 to PE4 and PE3. PW1, PW2, PW3 and PW4 are
          all UP. In order to support N:1 or 1:1 protection, only one PW MUST
          be selected to forward traffic. This document defines an additional
          PW state that reflects this forwarding state, which is separate from
          the operational status of the PW. This is the &lsquo;Preferential
          Forwarding Status&rsquo;.</t>

          <t>If a PW has a preferential forwarding status of
          &lsquo;active&rsquo;, it can be used for forwarding traffic. The
          actual UP PW chosen by the combined set of PEs connected to the CEs
          is determined by considering the preferential forwarding status of
          each PW at each PE. The mechanisms for communicating the
          preferential forwarding status are outside the scope of this
          document. Only one PW is used for forwarding.</t>

          <t>The following failure scenario illustrates the operation of PW
          redundancy in <xref target="multi-multi-homed-ces"></xref>. In the
          initial steady state, when there are no failures of the ACs, one of
          the PWs is chosen as the active PW, and all others are chosen as
          standby. The dual-homing protocol between CE1 and PE1/PE2 chooses to
          use the AC to PE2, while the protocol between CE2 and PE3/PE4
          chooses to use the AC to PE4. Therefore the PW between PE2 and PE4
          is chosen as the active PW to complete the path between CE1 and
          CE2.</t>

          <t>On failure of the AC between the dual-homed CE1 and PE2, the
          preferential forwarding status of the PWs at PE1, PE2, PE3 and PE4
          needs to change so as to re-establish a path from CE1 to CE2.
          Different mechanisms can be used to achieve this and these are
          beyond the scope of this document. After the change in status, the
          algorithm needs to revaluate and select which PW to forward traffic
          on. In this application, each dual-homing algorithm, i.e., {CE1,
          PE1, PE2} and {CE2, PE3, PE4}, selects the active AC independently.
          There is therefore a need to signal the active status of each AC
          such that the PEs can select a common active PW for forwarding
          between CE1 and CE2.</t>

          <t>Changes occurring on one side of network due to a failure of the
          AC or PE are not propagated to the ACs on the other side of the
          network. Furthermore, failures in the PSN are not propagated to the
          attached CEs. Note that end-to-end native service protection
          switching can also be used to protect the emulated service in this
          scenario. In this case, PW3 and PW4 are not necessary.</t>

          <t>If the CEs do not perform native service protection switching,
          they may instead use load balancing across the paths between the
          CEs.</t>

          There are three multi-segment PWs. PW1 is switched at S-PE1, PW2 is
          switched at S-PE2, and PW3 is switched at S-PE3.</t>

          <t>Since there is no multi-homing running on the ACs, the T-PE nodes
          advertise 'active' for the preferential forwarding status based on a
          priority for the PW. The priority associates a meaning of 'primary
          PW' and 'secondary PW' to a PW. These priorities MUST be used if
          revertive mode is used and the active PW to use for forwarding
          determined accordingly. The priority can be derived via
          configuration or based on the value of the PW FEC. For example, a
          lower value of PWid FEC can be taken as a higher priority. However,
          this does not guarantee selection of same PW by the T-PEs because
          of, for example, a mismatch in the configuration of the PW priority
          at each T-PE. The intent of this application is for T-PE1 and T-PE2
          to synchronize the transmit and receive paths of the PW over the
          network. In other words, both T-PE nodes are required to transmit
          over the PW segment which is switched by the same S-PE. This is
          desirable for ease of operation and troubleshooting.</t>

            </figure>In <xref target="mtu-dual-homing"></xref>, the MTU-s is
          dual homed to PE1-rs and PE2-rs and has spoke PWs to each of them.
          The MTU-s needs to choose only one of the spoke PWs (the active PW)
          to forward traffic to one of the PEs, and sets the other PW to
          standby. The MTU-s can derive the status of the PWs based on local
          policy configuration. PE1-rs and PE2-rs are connected to the H-VPLS
          core on the other side of network. The MTU-s communicates the status
          of its member PWs for a set of virtual switching instances (VSIs)
          that share a common status of active or standby. Here, the MTU-s
          controls the selection of PWs used to forward traffic. Signaling
          using PW grouping with a common group-id in the PWid FEC Element, or
          a Grouping TLV in Generalized PWid FEC Element as defined in <xref
          target="RFC4447"></xref>, to PE1-rs and PE2-rs, is recommended for
          improved scaling.</t>

          <t>Whenever an MTU-s performs a switchover of the active PW group,
          it needs to communicate this status change the PE2-rs. That is, it
          informs PE2-rs that the status of the standby PW group has changed
          to active.</t>

          <t>In this scenario, PE devices are aware of switchovers at the
          MTU-s and could generate MAC Withdraw messages to trigger MAC
          flushing within the H-VPLS full-mesh. By default, MTU-s devices
          should still trigger MAC withdraw messages as defined in <xref
          target="RFC4762"></xref> to prevent two copies of MAC withdraws to
          be sent (one by the MTU-s and another one by the PE-rs'). Mechanisms
          to disable the MAC withdraw trigger in certain devices are out of
          the scope of this document.</t>

          <t><xref target="vpls-bridge"></xref> shows a scenario with two
          provider access networks. Each network has two n-Pes. These n-PEs
          are connected via a full mesh of PWs for a given VPLS instance. As
          shown in the figure, only one n-PE in each access network serves as
          the primary PE (P) for that VPLS instance and the other n-PE serves
          as the backup PE (B). In this figure, each primary PE has two active
          PWs originating from it. Therefore, when a multicast, broadcast, or
          unknown unicast frame arrives at the primary n-PE from the access
          network side, the n-PE replicates the frame over both PWs in the
          core even though it only needs to send the frames over a single PW
          (shown with :::: in the figure) to the primary n-PE on the other
          side. This is an unnecessary replication of the customer frames that
          consumes core-network bandwidth (half of the frames get discarded at
          the receiving n-PE). This issue gets aggravated when there is three
          or more n-PEs per provider, access network. For example if there are
          three n-PEs or four n-PEs per access network, then 67% or 75% of
          core bandwidthfor multicast, broadcast and unknown unicast are
          wasted, respectively.</t>

          <t>In this scenario, the n-PEs can communicate the active or standby
          status of the PWs among them. This status can be derived from the
          active or backup state of an n-PE for a given VPLS.</t>

            <t>Protection architectures such as N:1,1:1 or 1+1 are possible.
            1:1 protection MUST be supported. The N:1 protection case is less
            efficient in terms of the resources that must be allocated and
            hence this SHOULD be supported. 1+1 protection MAY be used in the
            scenarios described in the document. However, the details of its
            usage are outside the scope of this document.</t>

            <t>Non-revertive behavior MUST be supported, while revertive
            behavior is OPTIONAL. This avoids the need to designate one PW as
            primary unless revertive behavior is explicitly required.</t>

            <t>Protection switchover can be initiated from a PE e.g. using a
            manual lockout/force switchover, or it may be triggered by a
            signal failure i.e. a defect in the PW or PSN. Manual switchover
            may be necessary if it is required to disable one PW in a
            redundant set. Both methods MUST be supported and signal failure
            triggers MUST be treated with a higher priority than any local or
            far-end manual trigger.</t>

            <t>Note that a PE MAY be able to forward packets received from a
            PW with a standby status in order to avoid black holing of
            in-flight packets during switchover. However, in the case of use
            of VPLS, all VPLS application packets received from standby PWs
            MUST be dropped, except for OAM packets.</t>
