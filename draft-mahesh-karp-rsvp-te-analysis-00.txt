Internet-Draft              RSVP-TE Analysis               December 2012


1.  Introduction

   In March 2006, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) described an
   attack on core routing infrastructure as an ideal attack that would
   inflict the greatest amount of damage, in their Report from the IAB
   workshop on Unwanted Traffic March 9-10, 2006 [RFC4948], and suggests
   steps to tighten the infrastructure against the attack.

   This document performs the initial analysis of the current state of
   RSVP-TE according to the requirements of KARP Design Guidelines
   [RFC6518].  This draft builds on several previous analysis efforts
   into routing security.  The OPSEC working group put together Issues
   with existing Cryptographic Protection Methods for Routing Protocols
   [RFC6039] an analysis of cryptographic issues with routing protocols
   and Analysis of BGP, LDP, PCEP, and MSDP Issues According to KARP
   Design Guide [draft-ietf-karp-routing-tcp-analysis] which is a
   analysis of the four routing protocols.

   Section 2 looks at the current security state of RSVP-TE.  Section 3
   does a analysis of the gap between the existing and the optimal
   security state of the protocol and suggest some areas where we need
   to improve.

2.  Current Security State of RSVP-TE

   This section looks at RSVP-TE and the underlying transport protocol
   and key mechanisms built for the protocol.

   RSVP-TE is an extension of the RSVP protocol for traffic engineering.
   It supports the reservation of resources across IP networks and is
   used for establishing Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label
   Switch Paths (LSPs).  RSVP-TE signaling is used to establish both
   intra- and inter-domain TE LSPs.  It is RSVP Cryptographic
   Authentication [RFC2747] that describes the format and use of RSVP's
   INTEGRITY objects to provide hop-by-hop integrity and authentication
   of RSVP messages.  RSVP-TE which uses some of the same formats
   therefore can make use of some of the same authentication mechanisms.
   The rest of the document will therefore focus on current state of
   security for RSVP.  Currently, there is no security approach
   specified for RSVP-TE particularly.  However, the security mechanisms
   for RSVP RSVP Cryptographic Authentication [RFC2747] can be taken
   advantage of to provide the security protection for the RSVP-TE
   message transportation.

   There is a requirement that RSVP-TE headers and payload be
   authenticated.  There is no requirement that they be encrypted and
   that work is outside the scope of KARP WG.  RSVP Cryptographic
   Authentication [RFC2747] outlines the use HMAC-MD5.  When using HMAC-
   MD5, the length of the keyed digests is 128 bits.  In these cases
   RSVP checksum can be disabled in lieu of message digest.

   RSVP uses 64 bit monotonically increasing sequence numbers to prevent
   against replay attacks.  The sequence number space is large enough to
   guarantee that a sequence number will never reach its maximum and
   roll back within a reasonable long period.

   To address the issue of out-of-order message delivery, the solution
   allows administrators to specify a sequence number window
   corresponding to the worst case reordering behavior.  Instead of
   requiring the sequence number of an incoming packet to be strictly
   larger than the ones previously received, a packet will be accepted
   if its sequence number is within the window.  The solution provides
   three approaches to generate unique monotonically increasing sequence
   numbers across a failure or a restart.  The solutions include:

   1.  Maintaining sequence numbers in stable memory

   2.  Introducing the data from a local time clock into the generation
       of sequence numbers after a restart

   3.  Introducing the timing information from a Network Recovered Clock
       into the generation of sequence numbers after a restart.

   In addition, a handshake is defined for a receiver to get the latest
   value of a sequence number.  Therefore, this solution is effective in
   addressing the issues caused by the rollback of sequence numbers
   across a system restart or failure.  However, when a router uses the
   approach to generating sequence numbers with the time information
   from NTP, an attacker may try to deceive the router to generate a
   sequence number which is less than the sequence numbers it used to
   have, by sending replayed or foiled NTP information.

   The protocol states that manual keying should be supported and states
   the need for a key management protocol to distribute keys.  It even
   states that the Key Identifier be the hook between RSVP and the key
   management protocol.  But it deliberately excludes defining a
   integrated key management protocol technique in the draft.  However,
   it does define a key lifetime that should be recorded for all systems
   using values such as KeyStartValid and KeyEndValid.  It even advises
   that the keys should be changed on a regular basis and that multiple
   keys should be used to transition from one key to another.

   RSVP does not explicitly mention Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and
   how to prevent against it.  However, RSVP-TE does know the peers that
   it should be communicating with and can therefore accept packets from
   known hosts only.

3.  Gap Analysis for RSVP-TE

   This section outlines the differences between the current state of
   RSVP-TE and the desired state as outlined in sections 4.1 and 4.2 of
   KARP Design Guidelines [RFC6518].

   In RSVP Cryptographic Authentication [RFC2747], only the usage of MD5
   to generate digests for RSVP-TE messages is mentioned.  In order to
   fulfill the requirement of supporting strong algorithms, at least the
   support of SHA-2 needs to be provided.

   In addition, in RSVP Cryptographic Authentication [RFC2747], three
   approaches to generating unique monotonically increasing sequence
   numbers across a failure and restart are introduced, but no approach
   is mandated.  However, as mentioned above, when using Network
   Recovered Clocks into the generation of sequence numbers, the
   capability of RSVP-TE in tolerating inter-connection replay attacks
   will largely rely on the security of network timing protocols.
   Therefore, in future this approach should not be recommended.
