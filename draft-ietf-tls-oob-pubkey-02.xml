    <abstract>
      <t>
         This document specifies a new TLS certificate type for exchanging
         raw public keys in Transport Layer Security (TLS)
         and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) for use with out-of-band
         public key validation. Currently, TLS authentication can only occur via X.509-based Public
Key Infrastructure (PKI) or OpenPGP certificates. By specifying a minimum resource for raw
         public key exchange, implementations can use alternative public key validation
         methods.
      </t>
      <t>
         One such alternative public key valiation method is offered by the DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) together with DNS Security. Another alternative is to utilize pre-configured keys, as is the case with sensors and other
         embedded devices. The usage of raw public keys, instead of X.509-based certificates, leads to a smaller 
         code footprint. 
      </t>

      <t>The support for raw public keys is introduced into TLS via a new non-PKIX certificate type.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

   <middle>
    <section anchor="into" title="Introduction">
       <t>Traditionally, TLS server public keys are obtained in PKIX containers
          in-band using the TLS handshake and validated using trust anchors
          based on a  <xref target='PKIX'/> certification authority (CA). This
          method can add a complicated trust relationship that is difficult
          to validate. Examples of such complexity can be seen in
          <xref target='Defeating-SSL'/>.</t>

       <t>Alternative methods are available that allow a TLS client to obtain
          the TLS server public key:</t>

       <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The TLS server public key is obtained from a DNSSEC secured resource records              
             using DANE <xref target="I-D.ietf-dane-protocol"/>.</t>

          <t>The TLS server public key is obtained from a <xref target='PKIX'/>
             certificate chain from an Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) <xref target="LDAP"/> server.</t>

          <t>The TLS client and server public key is provisioned into the operating system firmware image,
             and updated via software updates.</t>

<!--          <t>A TLS client has connected to the TLS server before and has cached
             the TLS server certificate chain or TLS server public key for re-use.</t> --> 
          </list>
       </t>

	   <!-- 
       <t><xref target='RFC5246'/> does not provide a mechanism for a TLS client
          to tell the TLS server it is already in possession of the authenticated
          public key. Therefore, a TLS server must always send a list of trusted
          CA keys and its EE certificate containing its public key, even when
          the TLS client does not require or desire that data for authentication.</t>

       <t><xref target='RFC6066'/> allows suppression of the certificate trust
          anchor chain, but not suppression of the PKIX EE certificate container.
          These certificate chains are large opaque blocks of data containing
          much more than the public key of the TLS server. Since the TLS client
          might only be able to validate the PKIX SubjectPublicKeyInfo via an
          out-of-band method, such as <xref target="I-D.ietf-dane-protocol"/>, it has to ignore any additional
          information received that was sent by the server that it could not
          validate. Furthermore, information that comes in via these certificate
          chains could contain contradicting or additional information that the
          TLS client cannot validate or trust, such as an expiry date that
          conflicts with information obtained from DNS or LDAP. This document
          specifies a method to suppress sending this additional information.</t>
       --> 
	   
       <t>Some smart objects use the UDP-based Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/> to
	      interact with a Web server to upload sensor data at a regular intervals, such as
          temperature readings. CoAP <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/> can utilize
          DTLS for securing the client-to-server communication. As part of the manufacturing process,
          the embeded device may be configured with the address and the public key of a
          dedicated CoAP server, as well as a public key for the client itself. 
		  The usage of X.509-based PKIX certificates <xref target='PKIX'/> may not suit all 
		  smart object deployments and would therefore be an unneccesarry burden.
       </t>
	   
	   <t>The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2 <xref target="RFC5246"/> provides
         a framework for extensions to TLS as well as guidelines for
         designing such extensions. This document uses the TLS Certificate Type extension point 
         to define a new non-X.509 certificate type for carrying raw public keys. <!-- to facilitate
         suppressing unneeded <xref target='PKIX'/> information from being sent

  <section title="Client Hello">

   <t>
   In order to indicate the support of out-of-band raw public keys,
   clients MUST include an extension of type "cert_type" to the extended
   client hello message.  The "cert_type" TLS extension, which is defined
   in <xref target="RFC6091"/>, is assigned the
   value of 9 from the TLS ExtensionType registry.  This value is used
   as the extension number for the extensions in both the client hello
   message and the server hello message.  The hello extension mechanism
   is described in <xref target="RFC5246"/>.
   </t>

   <t>
   The "cert_type" TLS extension carries a list of supported certificate types the
   client can use, sorted by client preference.  This extension MUST be
   omitted if the client only supports X.509 certificates.  The
   "extension_data" field of this extension contains a
   CertificateTypeExtension structure.  Note that the
   CertificateTypeExtension structure is being used both by the client
   and the server, even though the structure is only specified once in
   this document.
   </t>

<t>The <xref target="RFC6091"/> defined CertificateTypeExtension is extended
as follows:
<figure>
<artwork>
<![CDATA[    
enum { client, server } ClientOrServerExtension;

enum { X.509(0), OpenPGP(1), 
   RawPublicKey([TBD]), 
   (255) } CertificateType;

struct {
   select(ClientOrServerExtension) 
       case client:
         CertificateType certificate_types<1..2^8-1>;
       case server:
         CertificateType certificate_type;
   }
} CertificateTypeExtension;
]]>
</artwork>
</figure>
</t>

<t>No new cipher suites are required to use raw public keys.  All
   existing cipher suites that support a key exchange method compatible
   with the defined extension can be used.</t>

</section>

<section title="Server Hello">

<t>If the server receives a client hello that contains the "cert_type"
   extension and chooses a cipher suite then two outcomes are possible.
   The server MUST either select a certificate type from the CertificateType
   field in the extended client hello or terminate the session with a
   fatal alert of type "unsupported_certificate".</t>

<t>The certificate type selected by the server is encoded in a
   CertificateTypeExtension structure, which is included in the extended
   server hello message using an extension of type "cert_type".  Servers
   that only support X.509 certificates MAY omit including the
   "cert_type" extension in the extended server hello.
</t>

<t>If the negotiated certificate type is RawPublicKey the TLS server MUST
   place the SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure into the Certificate payload. <!-- send a CertificateTypeExtension structure with a PKIX <xref target='PKIX'/> certificate
   containing only the SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure.--> The public key MUST match the
   selected key exchange algorithm.</t>

</section>

<section title="Certificate Request">

<t>
   The semantics of this message remain the same as in the TLS
   specification. <!--  However, if this message is sent, and the negotiated
   certificate type is RawPublicKey, the
   "certificate_authorities" list MUST be empty. -->
</t>

</section>

<section title="Other Handshake Messages">

<t>All the other handshake messages are identical to the TLS
   specification.</t>

</section>


 </section>


    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">

	<t>The transmission of raw public keys, as described in this document, 
	provides benefits by lowering the over-the-air transmission overhead since 
	raw public keys are quite naturally smaller than an entire certificate. 
	There are also advantages from a codesize point of view for parsing and
    processing these keys. The crytographic procedures for assocating the 
	public key with the possession of a private key also follows standard 
	procedures.</t>

    <t>The main security challenge is, however, how to associate the public 
    key with a specific entity. This information will be needed to make 
    authorization decisions. Without a secure binding, man-in-the-middle 
    attacks may be the consequence. This document assumes that such 
	binding can be made out-of-band and we list a few examples in <xref target="into"/>. 
	DANE <xref target="I-D.ietf-dane-protocol"/> offers one such approach. 
	If public keys are obtained using DANE, these public keys are authenticated via DNSSEC.
	Pre-configured keys is another out of band method for authenticating raw public keys.
	 While pre-configured keys are not suitable for 
	a generic Web-based e-commerce environment such keys are a reasonable approach
	for many smart object deployments where there is a close relationship between 
	the software running on the device and the server-side communication endpoint. 
	Regardless of the chosen mechanism for out-of-band public key validation an 
	assessment of the most suitable approach has to be made prior to the start of a 
	deployment to ensure the security of the system.</t>
	
	<!--
    <t>The TLS cert_type extension defined here lets a TLS client attempt to supress
       the sending of server certificate as well as the certification chain
       for that certificate.</t>

       <t>A client using this cert_type needs to be confident in the
       authenticity of the public key it is using.  Since those
       public keys were obtained out-of-band their verification must also happen out-of-band.</t>

       <t>Depending on how the public keys were obtained, it may be
       appropriate to use authentication mechanisms tied to the public key
       transport.  For example, if public keys were obtained using DANE <xref target="I-D.ietf-dane-protocol"/>
       it is appropriate to use DNSSEC to authenticate the public keys.</t>

         <t>This document describes the protocol elements, along with
         their semantics and encodings, of the Lightweight Directory
         Access Protocol (LDAP).  LDAP provides access to distributed
         directory services that act in accordance with X.500 data
         and service models.  These protocol elements are based
         on those described in the X.500 Directory Access Protocol
         (DAP). [STANDARDS TRACK]</t>
