INTERNET DRAFT                 VXLAN-EVPN              February 24, 2013


1  Introduction

   [E-VPN] introduces a solution for multipoint L2VPN services, with
   advanced multi-homing capabilities, using BGP control plane over the
   core MPLS/IP network. [VXLAN] defines a tunneling scheme to overlay
   Layer 2 networks on top of Layer 3 networks. [VXLAN] allows for
   optimal forwarding of Ethernet frames with support for multipathing
   of unicast and multicast traffic. VXLAN uses UDP/IP encapsulation for
   tunneling.

   In this document, we discuss how Ethernet VPN (E-VPN) technology can
   be used to interconnect VXLAN or NVGRE networks over an MPLS/IP
   network. This is achieved by terminating the VxLAN tunnel at the the
   hand-off points, performing data plane MAC learning of customer
   traffic and providing intra-subnet connectivity for the customers at
   Layer 2 across the MPLS/IP core. The solution maintains control-plane
   separation among the interconnected VXLAN or NVGRE networks. The
   scope of the learning of host MAC addresses in VXLAN or NVGRE network
   is limited to data plane learning in this document. The distribution
   of MAC addresses in control plane using BGP in VXLAN or NVGRE network
   is outside of the scope of this document and it is covered in [EVPN-
   OVERLY].

2. Requirements

2.1. Control Plane Separation among VXLAN/NVGRE Networks

   It is required to maintain control-plane separation among the various
   VXLAN/NVGRE networks being interconnected over the MPLS/IP network.
   This ensures the following characteristics:

   - scalability of the IGP control plane in large deployments and fault
   domain localization, where link or node failures in one site do not
   trigger re-convergence in remote sites.

INTERNET DRAFT                 VXLAN-EVPN              February 24, 2013


   - scalability of multicast trees as the number of interconnected
   networks scales.

2.2 Layer 2 Extension of VNIs/VSIDs over the MPLS/IP Network

   It is required to extend the VXLAN VNIs or NVGRE VSIDs over the
   MPLS/IP network to provide intra-subnet connectivity between the
   hosts (e.g. VMs) at Layer 2. 

2.3 Support for Integrated Routing and Bridging (IRB)

   The data center WAN edge node is required to support integrated
   routing and bridging in order to accommodate both inter-subnet
   routing and intra-subnet bridging for a given VNI/VSID. For example,
   inter-subnet switching is required when a remote host connected to an
   enterprise IP-VPN site wants to access an application resided on a
   VM.

3. Solution Overview

   Every VXLAN/NVGRE network, which is connected to the MPLS/IP core,
   runs an independent instance of the IGP control-plane. Each PE
   participates in the IGP control plane instance of its local site. 

   Each PE node terminates the VXLAN or NVGRE data-plane encapsulation
   where each VNI or VSID is mapped to a bridge-domain. The PE performs
   data plane MAC learning on the traffic received from the VXLAN/NVGRE
   network.

   Each PE node implements E-VPN or PBB-EVPN to distribute either the
   client MAC addresses learnt over the VXLAN tunnel in case of EVPN, or
   the PEs' B-MAC addresses in case of PBB-EVPN. In the PBB-EVPN case,
   client MAC addresses will continue to be learnt in data plane. 

   Each PE node would encapsulate the Ethernet frames with MPLS when
   sending the packets over the MPLS core and with the VXLAN or NVGRE
   tunnel header when sending the packets over the VXLAN or NVGRE
   Network.

4.  E-VPN Routes This solution leverages the same BGP Routes and
   Attributes defined in [E-VPN], adapted as follows:

4.1.  BGP MAC Advertisement Route

   This route and its associated modes are used to distribute the
   customer MAC addresses learnt in data plane over the VXLAN tunnel in
   case of EVPN. Or can be used to distribute the provider Backbone MAC
   addresses in case of PBB-EVPN.

4.2.  Ethernet Auto-Discovery Route

   When EVPN is used, the application of this route is as specified in
   [EVPN]. However, when PBB-EVPN is used, there is no need for this
   route per [PBB-EVPN].

4.3.  Per VPN Route Targets

   VXLAN-EVPN uses the same set of route targets defined in [E-VPN]. 

4.4  Inclusive Multicast Route

   The E-VPN Inclusive Multicast route is used to distribute the VNI
   information over the MPLS network. This is required to perform the
   discovery of the PEs participating in a given VNI. It also enables
   the stitching of the IP multicast trees, which are local to each
   VXLAN site, with the Label Switched Multicast (LSM) trees of the MPLS
   network.

INTERNET DRAFT                 VXLAN-EVPN              February 24, 2013


   The Inclusive Multicast Route is encoded as follow:

   - Ethernet Tag ID is set to VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI).

   - Originating Router's IP Address is set to one of the PE's IP
   addresses.

   All other fields are set as defined in [E-VPN].

   Please see section 4.6  "Handling Multicast"

4.5.  Unicast Forwarding

   Host MAC addresses will be learnt in data plane from the VXLAN
   network and associated with the corresponding VTEP. Host MAC
   addresses will be learnt in control plane if E-VPN is implemented
   over the MPLS/IP core, or in the data-plane if PBB-EVPN is
   implemented over the MPLS core. When Host MAC addressed are learned
   in data plane over MPLS/IP core [in case of PBB-EVPN], they are
   associated with their corresponding BMAC addresses.

   L2 Unicast traffic destined to the VXLAN network will be encapsulated
   with the IP/UDP header and the corresponding customer bridge VNI.

   L2 Unicast traffic destined to the MPLS/IP network will be
   encapsulated with the MPLS label.

4.6. Handling Multicast

   Each VXLAN network independently builds its P2MP or MP2MP shared
   multicast trees. A P2MP or MP2MP tree is built for one or more VNIs
   local to the VXLAN network. 

   In the MPLS/IP network, multiple options are available for the
   delivery of multicast traffic:
      - Ingress replication
      - LSM with Inclusive trees
      - LSM with Aggregate Inclusive trees
      - LSM with Selective trees
      - LSM with Aggregate Selective trees
   When LSM is used, the trees are P2MP.

   The PE nodes are responsible for stitching the IP multicast trees, on
   the access side, to the ingress replication tunnels or LSM trees in
   the MPLS/IP core. The stitching must ensure that the following
   characteristics are maintained at all times:

   1. Avoiding Packet Duplication: In the case where the VXLAN network

INTERNET DRAFT                 VXLAN-EVPN              February 24, 2013


   is multi-homed to multiple PE nodes, if all of the PE nodes forward
   the same multicast frame, then packet duplication would arise. This
   applies to both multicast traffic from site to core as well as from
   core to site.

   2. Avoiding Forwarding Loops: In the case of VXLAN network multi-
   homing, the solution must ensure that a multicast frame forwarded by
   a given PE to the MPLS core is not forwarded back by another PE (in
   the same VXLAN network) to the VXLAN network of origin. The same
   applies for traffic in the core to site direction.

   The following approach of per-VNI load balancing can guarantee proper
   stitching that meets the above requirements. 

4.6.2. Multicast Stitching with Per-VNI Load Balancing

   The PE nodes, connected to a multi-homed VXLAN network, perform BGP
   DF election to decide which PE node is responsible for forwarding
   multicast traffic associated with a given VNI. A PE would forward
   multicast traffic for a given VNI only when it is the DF for this
   VNI. This forwarding rule applies in both the site to core as well as
   core to site directions. 

5. NVGRE

   Just like VXLAN, all the above specification would apply for NVGRE,
   replacing the VNI with Virtual Subnet Identifier (VSID) and the VTEP
   with NVGRE Endpoint.
