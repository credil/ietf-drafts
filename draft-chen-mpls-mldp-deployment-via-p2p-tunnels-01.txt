                 Deploying mLDP Through P2P LSP Tunnels
         draft-chen-mpls-mldp-deployment-via-p2p-tunnels-01.txt

Abstract

   The existing specification for Multipoint Label Distribution Protocol
   (mLDP) functionality assumes that a pair of LDP speakers which
   support the P2MP/MP2MP capability are directly connected, or they can
   reach each other through targeted LDP session and transparent
   tunnel(s).  However, the real deployment may not satisfy these
   assumptions, especially in the case where the targeted LDP session
   and the transparent tunnel(s) have to be pre-established.  This
   document provides an automatic solution for finding the nearest
   upstream node which supports the LDP P2MP/MP2MP along the path from
   the current node to the root node, and triggering the targeted LDP
   session and transparent tunnel(s) when needed.

Internet-Draft   Deploying mLDP Through P2P LSP Tunnels        July 2012


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Motivation

   In practical world, it is extremely hard to synchronously upgrade all
   the nodes in a huge network, especially upgrading all the hardware at
   the same time.  Thus, unless users choose to deploy mLDP by building
   a completely new network, otherwise there must be a migration period
   from non-mLDP to mLDP capable.  During this period, in order to setup
   Point-to-MultiPoint (P2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) and
   Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) LSPs through the non-mLDP node(s), a
   common solution is to make mLDP LSPs going through targeted LDP
   sessions and transparent tunnels.

   The motivation of this draft is to trigger such kind of mLDP LSP
   automatically, so that several benefits can be brought in.  First of
   all, the manual configuration of the targeted LDP sessions and
   transparent tunnels can be waived, correspondingly the network
   operation cost can be reduced.  Secondly, users don't need to worry
   about traffic lost, because no matter whether the necessary targeted
   LDP sessions and transparent tunnels are correctly predicted and pre-
   configured, they will be automatically triggered when needed.
   Besides, because the targeted LDP sessions and transparent tunnels
   are built on demand, the resource consumption of system can be
   minimal.

1.3.  Overview

   As specified by [RFC6388], mLDP Label Mapping message would be
   stopped when there is no mLDP-capable upstream node.  Take the
   following scenario as an example, where the R4 node finds out that
   its upstream node R3 doesn't support mLDP, and there is no other node
   which R4 can use as its upstream node towards Root node, then this
   mLDP LSP establishment would fail.

   This document specifies a mechanism for deploying the mLDP with the

   forwarding plan, mixed with the nodes which do not support the mLDP
   but can propagate the mLDP mapping message toward the root until it
   finds the node which supports the mLDP.  Both the protocol extensions
   and processing procedures are specified in this documents.

                                 Figure 1

   In the figure above, when the R4 finds out that the upstream router
   R3 doesn't support mLDP completely but it supports the mLDP Tunnel
   Through capability, R4 will send out a notification message with its
   LSR-ID.  When the R3 receives this notification message, it will
   propagate the notification message to is upstream router until
   arriving the nearest mLDP capable router, such as R1 in this case.
   When R1 receives the notification message, it will trigger the
   establishment of targeted LDP session and transparent tunnel to R4.
   When finished, R1 will notify R4 to consider it as an upstream
   router.  Then mLDP advertisement is able to continue.

        mLDP Deployment Through Transparent Tunnels for Branch Node

                                 Figure 2

   In the figure above, assume that R5 has already setup targeted LDP
   session and transparent tunnel with R3.  When the R6 joins this mLDP
   LSP and finds out that the upstream router R4 doesn't support mLDP
   completely but it supports the mLDP Tunnel Through capability, R6
   will trigger another targeted LDP session and transparent tunnel
   between R6 and R3.  In this case, R3 will become the branch node for
   this mLDP LSP, where the outgoing two branches are implemented by
   using two tranparent tunnels.

   o  LDP speakers advertise their capabilities in Initialization
      message or Capability message.

   o  Assume that the node D is setting up the MP-LSP <R, X>, D finds
      out that the direct connected "upstream LSR" for <R, X> does not
      support mLDP, but it supports mLDP Tunnel Through capability.

   o  The node D sends an notification message to this upstream node
      with its local LSR-ID and mLDP LSP's root node IP address.

   o  The next hop node propagate the notification message to its
      upstream node until it reaches the node which supports the full
      mLDP capability.

   o  When the first node which has mLDP full capability receives this
      notification, it will trigger LDP target session(s) and
      transparent tunnel(s) with the node D identified by the LSR-ID in
      the notification message.  When finished, this first node will
      tell the node D identified by the LSR-ID to chose it as the
      upstream router for the mLDP LSP establishment.

   o  Once the node with the LSR-ID receives this notification from the
      first node, it will setup the mLDP LSP as its upstream node to the
      root of the mLDP using the method superficies in
      draft-napierala-mpls-targeted-mldp.

2.2.  Protocol Extensions

   Two new types of LDP MP Status Value Element are defined, following
   the MP Status TLV specification in [RFC6388].  One of them is used to
   identify the root node address of the mLDP, the other is used for
   identifying the LSR which needs the p2p tunnel to setup the mLDP LSP.
   Their encoding are as follows:


        0                   1                   2                   3

3.  mLDP Tunnel Through Capability

   The mLDP Tunnel Through Capability is advertised among the LDP peers.
   The encoding of mLDP Tunnel Through Capability Parameter TLV is:


        0                   1                   2                   3

       |1|0| mLDP Tunnel Through (TBD) |      Length (= 1)             |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |S| Reserved    |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

    S: As specified in [RFC5561]


   If one router does not received the mLDP Tunnel Through Capability
   advertisement from its neighbor, it should not send the mLDP Tunnel
   Through related messages to this neighbor.  If one router receives
   the mLDP capability annoucement with the mLDP Tunnel Through
   capbility, it will silently ignore the mLDP Tunnel Through capability
   and consider the sender supports fully mLDP capability.  Also if the
   router has not advertised the mLDP Tunnel Through Capability, and it
   receives the mLDP Tunnel Through related messages, then the receiver
   of the message will treat this error as same as it treats for other
   unrecognized messages.


4.  Handling Route Change Or Failure Event

   Assume that the targeted LDP session between the two LSRs with the

   mLDP capabilities is established, if there is a route change event
   and as the result of this, the downstream router of these two LSR
   will have a new upstream router to the root for a specific mLDP LSP,
   then the downstream router will treat this similar as the normal re-
   route cases.  If there is no Make Before Break (MBB) supported, then
   the downstream router will delete the LSP setup through targeted
   session, then delete the useless targeted session and transparent
   tunnel(s).  If there is MBB deployed, then the downstream router will
   setup the new LSP first and then delete the existing LSP using the
   MBB procedures.

   If the route from mLDP node to Root node doesn't change, but the
   route from the lightweight mLDP node to Root node changes, this
   lightweight mLDP node needs to withdraw the previous notification and
   advertise a new one to the new upstream node.
