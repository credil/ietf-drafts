Abstract

   This document specifies VPLS extensions to support the new VLAN aware
   bundling service interface type. The new service interface type
   provides advantages in reducing the provisioning overhead, as well as
   pseudowire scalability in environments where a large number of VLANs
   need to be extended over an MPLS/IP network while maintaining traffic
   segregation among those VLANs.

   The VLAN aware bundling service interface can handle the high scale
   requirements of today's Data Centers by bundling different VLANs over
   a single WAN VPLS instance used to interconnect sites. Furthermore,
   this document specifies an extension to the LDP MAC Withdrawal
   mechanisms to allow per-VLAN MAC flushing for the new service
   interface type.

INTERNET DRAFT          VLAN Aware VPLS Services        October 13, 2012


1  Introduction

   The high scale requirements of Layer 2 data center interconnect
   services mandate the signaling of a large number of WAN VPLS
   instances. As such, network operators are looking for solutions
   whereby they can extend multiple Ethernet VLANs over a WAN using a
   single VPLS instance, while maintaining traffic segregation among
   these VLANs in the data-plane. This gives rise to a requirement for 
   new service interface types: the VLAN aware bundling service
   interfaces.

   These new VLAN aware bundling service interfaces MUST: 
      - Provide the ability to bundle multiple customer VLANs 
      - Guarantee customer VLAN transparency end-to-end.
      - Maintain data-plane separation between the customer VLANs by 
      creating a dedicated bridge-domain per VLAN.
      - Support customer VLAN translation to handle the scenario where 
      different VLAN Identifiers (VIDs) are used on different sites to 
      designate the same customer VLAN.

   As discussed in [EVPN-REQ], two new service interface types are
   defined for VLAN aware bundling: with and without translation. The
   new service interfaces maintain data-plane separation, per VLAN,
   while sharing one L2VPN VPN instance. In this document, we focus on
   the scenario where VPLS is the L2VPN technology. This document
   defines a new PW VLAN Vector TLV to be included in the LDP PW FEC
   label mapping messages for the VPLS service, using the mechanisms
   specified in RFC 4762, as well as a new LDP capability by which a PE
   can specify its ability to support this new VLAN aware bundling
   service interface type. Furthermore, This document defines extension
   to the PWE3 control protocol [RFC4447] to set up the new VLAN aware
   bundling type service in MPLS networks. The document specifies as
   well an extension to the MAC Withdrawal mechanisms to allow per VLAN
   service MAC flushing for this new VLAN aware bundling service.

2.  VLAN-aware-bundling PW

   [RFC4447] uses LDP Label Mapping message [RFC5036] for advertising
   the FEC-to-PW Label binding. Two types of PW FEC, FEC-128 and FEC-
   129, can be used for this purpose. Both types of PW FEC contain a PW
   type Field.

   PW type port or raw mode will be used for the VLAN aware bundling
   interface type service.

   Use of control word is optional and frame encapsulation follows the
   same rules as in [RFC4448].

   A new PW VLAN vector TLV is defined, the new PW VLAN Vector TLV will
   be included in LDP PW label mapping messages, as well it MAY be
   included in the MAC flush message.

3.  PW VLAN Vector TLV

   The PW VLAN Vector TLV is described as below:
       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |1|1|           VLAN Vector(TBD)|           Length              |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |first VLAN Value       |NumberOfValues         |               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+               |
      |                VLANFlushBits[NumberOfValues]                  |
      |                             "                                 |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   The U and F bits are set to forward if unknown so that potential
   intermediate VPLS PEs unaware of the new TLV can just propagate it
   transparently.

   The MAC Flush VLAN Vector TLV type is to be assigned by IANA from   
   the LDP standard [RFC5036] "TLV type name space", as described in
   section 7.

   The TLV value field is of variable length. The first 12 bits encode
   the starting VLAN value. The second 12 bits contain the number of
   values. The VLANFlushBits is an array of bits of length =
   NumberOfValues, each bit in the array represents a VLAN flush state
   starting from the 1st VLAN value. A bit value of 1 means flush and a
   bit value of 0 means don't flush

   A Starting VLAN value of 0, SHOULD mean include all VLANs, in this
   case the NumberOfValues SHOULD be 0.

INTERNET DRAFT          VLAN Aware VPLS Services        October 13, 2012


   The PW VLAN Vector TLV SHOULD be placed after the PW FEC TLV in the
   label mapping message as specified in [RFC4447], and SHOULD be placed
   after the existing TLVs in MAC Flush message as specified in
   [RFC4762].

4.  LDP Capability Negotiation

   The capability of supporting VLAN Aware Bundling interface type
   Service MUST be advertised to all LDP peers. This is achieved by
   using the methods in [RFC5561] and advertising the LDP "VLAN aware
   Bundling Capability" TLV. If an LDP peer supports the dynamic
   capability advertisement, it can send a new Capability message with
   the S bit set for the VLAN Aware Bundling capability TLV. If the peer
   does not support dynamic capability advertisement, then the VLAN
   aware Bundling Capability TLV MUST be included in the LDP
   Initialization message during the session establishment. An LSR
   having VLAN Aware Bundling capability MUST recognize the new PW VLAN
   Vector TLV in LDP label messages.

   In line with the requirements listed in [RFC5561], the following TLV
   is defined to indicate the VLAN Aware Bundling capability:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |U|F| VLAN Aware Capability TBD |            Length             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |S| Reserved    |    Reserved   |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      Note: TLV number pending IANA allocation.

        * U-bit: SHOULD be 1 (ignore if not understood).

        * F-bit: SHOULD be 0 (don't forward if not understood).

        * VLAN Aware Bundling Capability TLV Code Point: The TLV type,
        which identifies a specific capability. The VLAN Aware
        capability code point is requested in the IANA allocation
        section below.

        * S-bit: The State Bit indicates whether the sender is
        advertising or withdrawing the VLAN Aware capability. The State
        bit is used as  follows:

        1 - The TLV is advertising the capability specified by the TLV
        Code Point.

        Code Point.

        * Length: MUST be set to 2 (octet).

           |             +---------------+   |               
           |                                 |               
           +---------------------------------+
   One VPLS instance has been set up between two sites to extend
   multiple customer VLANs. On each site, multiple CE devices could be
   connected to the PE. The link between the CE and the PE could be
   802.1q or 802.1ad, setup with multiple VLANs. Unlike a classic VPLS
   solution that requires a dedicated VPLS instance for each customer
   VLAN, only a single VPLS instance has been set up to carry customer
   VLANs between the two sites. The use of two sites in the above figure
   is for illustration; however, this could be extended to many sites.
   In order to quantify the benefit of the approach, let's assume N data
   center sites, with M customer VLANs. Classic VPLS full mesh solution
   would require M VPLS instances and M*(N-1) PWs on each PE. While with
   the new VLAN aware interface service type, the solution would require
   one VPLS instance and will only require (N-1) PWs on each PE. To
   maintain data-plane separation per customer VLAN, with the new VLAN
   aware interface service, each PE will create a bridge-domain per
   customer VLAN. As well, a customer VLAN on each CE port will
   represent a unique bridge port in the customer bridge-domain. Only
   one VPLS instance would be signaled in the core and will be used to
   carry multiple customer bridge-domains (or customer VLANs) as long as

INTERNET DRAFT          VLAN Aware VPLS Services        October 13, 2012


   those customer VLANs need to be extended to the same set of sites.
   Unlike classic VPLS, where the VPLS PW is presented as a bridge port,
   the VFI and the customer VLAN would map to the customer bridge-
   domain.

5.1. Packet forwarding, MAC learning, aging and flushing

   Given the data-plane separation, packet forwarding in the scope of
   one bridge-domain will remain unchanged. When sending traffic over
   the PW, a qualifying VLAN tag MUST be present on the packet. This
   VLAN tag has global significance across all sites connected to the
   VPLS instance and is used to identify the customer bridge domain in
   all sites. MAC learning, aging and flushing per bridge-domain will
   remain un-changed. Extensions to MAC withdrawal mechanisms, as
   described in section 4, would allow the MAC flushing to occur on a
   subset of the customer bridge-domains.

5.2. Multicast Pruning

   Efficient multicast replication in the core can be achieved via the
   use of the new VLAN vector TLV, to prune the flooding on a per VLAN
   basis. It is possible to only replicate traffic to PEs that have
   advertised a given VLAN in their Vector TLV. Multicast snooping
   protocols such as IGMP and PIM MAY be used to further prune the
   replication scope for a given multicast group in one customer bridge-
   domain.

5.3. OAM

   Customer Ethernet OAM frames (e.g. CFM [802.1ag]) will be carried
   transparently over the shared VPLS instance by the customers bridge-
   domains. Current VCCV mechanisms can be used to verify PWs
   connectivity in the VPLS instance shared by the customer bridge-
   domains. VPLS OAM framework as defined in [RFC6136] applies to this
   new service with no changes.

5.4. VLAN translation

   As mentioned above, the VLAN tag carried across the PWs for the new
   VLAN aware bundling VPLS instance MUST have network global
   significance within the scope of the VPLS instance. As such, VLAN
   translation can happen at each PE attached to the VPLS instance to
   translate between the global VLAN tag identifying the customer
   bridge-domain and the local VLAN tag used by the customer bridge-
   domain on this PE.


6. Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any additional security constraints.

7. IANA Considerations

   Two new types field for the VLAN Vector TLV type and VLAN aware
   Bundling Capability TLV type are to be assigned by IANA from the LDP
   standard [RFC5036] "TLV type name space".
