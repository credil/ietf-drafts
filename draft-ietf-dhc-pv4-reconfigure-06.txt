This document defines extensions to DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol) to allow dynamic reconfiguration of a single host triggered
by the DHCP server (e.g., a new IP address and/or local configuration
parameters).  This is achieved by introducing a unicast FORCERENEW
message which forces the client to the RENEW state.  The behaviour for
hosts using the DHCP INFORM message to obtain configuration
information is also described.

This document is a product of the Dynamic Host Configuration Working
Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
