      networks. This document is not intended to highlight a particular

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>IPv6 is an integral part of modern network deployments. At the time
      when this document was written, the majority of these IPv6 deployments
      were using dual-stack implementations, where IPv4 and IPv6 are supported
      equally on many or all of the network nodes, and single-stack primarily
      referred to IPv4-only devices. Dual-stack deployments provide a useful
      margin for protocols and features that are not currently capable of
      operating solely over IPv6, because they can continue using IPv4 as
      necessary. However, as IPv6 deployment and usage becomes more pervasive,
      and IPv4 exhaustion begins driving changes in address consumption
      behaviors, there is an increasing likelihood that many networks will
      need to start operating some or all of their network nodes either as
      primarily IPv6 (most functions use IPv6, a few legacy features use
      IPv4), or as IPv6-only (no IPv4 provisioned on the device). This
      transition toward IPv6-only operation exposes any gaps where features,
      protocols, or implementations are still reliant on IPv4 for proper
      function. To that end, and in the spirit of <xref target="RFC6540">RFC
      6540's</xref> recommendation that implementations need to stop requiring
      IPv4 for proper and complete function, this document reviews the
      Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) protocol suite in the context of
      IPv6 and identifies gaps that must be addressed in order to allow
      MPLS-related protocols and applications to be used with IPv6-only
      networks. This document is not intended to highlight a particular
      vendor's implementation (or lack thereof) in the context of IPv6-only
      MPLS functionality, but rather to focus on gaps in the standards
      defining the MPLS suite.</t>

    <section title="Use Case">
      <t>From a purely theoretical perspective, ensuring that MPLS is fully IP
      version-agnostic is the right thing to do. However, it is sometimes
      helpful to understand the underlying drivers that make this work
      necessary to undertake, especially at a time when IPv6-only networking
      is still fairly uncommon. This section will discuss some drivers. It is
      not intended to be a comprehensive discussion of all potential use
      cases, but rather a discussion of at least one use case so that this is
      not seen as solving a purely theoretical problem.</t>

      <t>IP convergence is continuing to drive new classes of devices to begin
      communicating via IP. Examples of such devices could include set top
      boxes for IP Video distribution, cell tower electronics (macro or micro
      cells), infrastructure Wi-Fi Access Points, and devices for machine to
      machine (M2M) or Internet of Things applications. In some cases, these
      classes of devices represent a very large deployment base, on the order
      of thousands or even millions of devices network-wide. The scale of
      these networks, coupled with the increasingly overlapping use of <xref
      target="RFC1918">RFC 1918</xref> address space within the average
      network, and the lack of globally-routable IPv4 space available for
      long-term growth begins to drive the need for many of the endpoints in
      this network to be managed solely via IPv6. Even if these devices are
      carrying some IPv4 user data, it is often encapsulated in another
      protocol such that the communication between the endpoint and its
      upstream devices can be IPv6-only without impacting support for IPv4 on
      user data. Depending on the MPLS features required, it is plausible to
      assume that the (existing) MPLS network may need to be extended to these
      devices.</t>

      <t>Additionally, as the impact of IPv4 exhaustion becomes more acute,
      more and more aggressive IPv4 address reclamation measures will be
      justified. Measures that were previously seen as too complex or as
      netting too few addresses for the work required may become more
      realistic as the cost for obtaining new IPv4 addresses increases. More
      and more networks are likely to adopt the general stance that IPv4
      addresses need to be preserved for revenue-generating customers so that
      legacy support for IPv4 can be maintained as long as possible. As a
      result, it may be appropriate for some or all of the network
      infrastructure, including MPLS LSRs and LERs, to have its IPv4 addresses
      reclaimed and transition toward IPv6-only operation.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Gap Analysis">
      <t>This gap analysis aims to answer the question, "what breaks when one
      attempts to use MPLS features on a network of IPv6-only devices?" The
      baseline assumption for this analysis is that some endpoints as well as
      Label Switch Routers (PE and P routers) only have IPv6 transport
      available, and need to support the full suite of MPLS features defined
      as of the time of this document's writing at parity with the support on
      an IPv4 network. This is necessary whether they are enabled via Label
      Distribution Protocol (LDP) <xref target="RFC5036">RFC 5036</xref>,
      Resource Reservation Protocol Extensions for MPLS Traffic Engineering
      (RSVP-TE) <xref target="RFC5420">RFC 5420</xref>, or Border Gateway
      Protocol (BGP) <xref target="RFC3107">RFC 3107</xref>, and whether they
      are encapsulated in MPLS <xref target="RFC3032">RFC 3032</xref>, IP
      <xref target="RFC4023">RFC 4023</xref>, Generic Routing Encapsulation
      (GRE) <xref target="RFC4023">RFC 4023</xref>, or Layer 2 Tunneling
      Protocol Version 3 (L2TPv3) <xref target="RFC4817">RFC 4817</xref>. It
      is important when evaluating these gaps to distinguish between user data
      and control plane data, because while this document is focused on
      IPv6-only operation, it is quite likely that some amount of the user
      payload data being carried in the IPv6-only MPLS network will still be
      IPv4.</t>

      <section title="MPLS Data Plane">
        <t>MPLS labeled packets can be transmitted over a variety of data
        links <xref target="RFC3032">RFC 3032</xref>, and MPLS labeled packets

          up Point to Multipoint (P2MP) and Multipoint to Multipoint (MP2MP)
          LSPs. These extensions are specified in <xref target="RFC6388">RFC

          identified areas of interest: <list style="numbers">
              <t>LDP Control plane: Since mLDP uses the LDP control plane to
              discover and establish sessions with the peer, it shares the
              same gaps as LDP with regards to control plane (discovery,
              transport, and session establishment) in an IPv6-only
              network.</t>

              <t>Multipoint (MP) FEC Root address: mLDP defines its own MP
              FECs and rules, different from LDP, to map MP LSPs. mLDP MP FEC
              contains a Root Address field which is an IP address in IP
              networks. The current specification allows specifying Root
              address according to AFI and hence covers both IPv4 or IPv6 root
              addresses, requiring no extension to support IPv6-only MP LSPs.
              The root address is used by each LSR participating in an MP LSP
              setup such that root address reachability is resolved by doing a
              table lookup against root address to find corresponding upstream
              neighbor(s). This will pose a problem when an MP LSP traverses
              islands of IPv4 and IPv4 clouds on the way to the root node.</t>
            </list>For example, consider following setup, where R1/R6 are
          IPv4-only, R3/R4 are IPv6-only, and R2/R5 are dual-stack LSRs:</t>

          FEC. As the MP LSP signaling proceeds from R1 to R6, the MP LSP
          setup will fail on the first IPv6-only transit/branch LSRs (R3) when
          trying to find IPv4 root address reachability. <xref

          BGP-free core in an VPN environment, but the similar concept can be
          used/extended to solve the above issue of IPv6-only backbone
          receiving an MP FEC element with an IPv4 address. The solution will
          require a border LSR (the one which is sitting on border of an
          IPv4/IPv6 island(s) (R2 and R5) to translate an IPv4 root address to
          equivalent IPv6 address (and vice vera) through the procedures

          target="RFC6074">RFC 6074</xref>, which specifies a set of
          procedures for instantiating L2VPNs (e.g. VPWS, VPLS) using BGP as

          <t>In an IPv6-only MPLS network, use of L2VPN represents connection

          devices. <xref target="RFC6074">RFC 6074</xref> is the only RFC that

          address in the VSI-ID, which is encoded in NLRI, and should not
          exceed 12 bytes (to differentiate its AFI/SAFI encoding from
          RFC4761). This means that PE IP address can NOT be an IPv6 address.
          Also, in its signaling procedures (section 3.2.3), it suggests
          encoding PE_addr in SAII and TAII, which are limited to 32-bit (AII

          IPv4-only MPLS network i.e. BGP Next Hop is assumed to have /32 (for

          Section 3.2 of RFC 4379). The only exceptions are the Pseudowire
          FECs later specified for IPv6 in <xref target="RFC6829">RFC
          6829</xref>.</t>

          <t>The multipath information includes also IPv6 encodings (see
          Section 3.3.1 of RFC 4379).</t>

          <t>Additionally, LSP Ping packets are UDP packets over both IPv4 and
          IPv6 (see Section 4.3 of RFC 4379). However, for IPv6, the
          destination IP address is a (randomly chosen) IPv6 address from the
          range 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:127/104. That is, using an IPv4-mapped IPv6
          address. This is a transitional mechanism that should not bleed into
          IPv6-only networks, as <xref
          target="I-D.itojun-v6ops-v4mapped-harmful"/> explains. The issue is
          that the MPLS LSP Ping mechanism needs a range of loopback IP
          addresses to be used as destination addresses to exercise ECMPs, but
          the IPv6 address architecture specifies a single address (::1/128)
          for loopback. A mechanism to achieve this was proposed in <xref
          target="I-D.smith-v6ops-larger-ipv6-loopback-prefix"/>.</t>

          <t>Another gap is that the mechanisms described in RFC 4379 may fail
          when tunneling IPv4 traffic over an LSP that is supported by
          IPv6-only infrastructure.</t>

          <t>Assume the following: <list style="symbols">
              <t>LSP Ping is operating in traceroute mode over an MPLS LSP</t>

              <t>the two routers that terminate the LSP run dual stack</t>

              <t>the LSP interior routers run IPv6 only</t>

              <t>the LSP is signaled over IPv6</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Packets will expire at LSP interior routers. According to RFC
          4379, the interior router must parse the IPv4 Echo Request, and
          then, send an IPv4 Echo Reply. However, the LSP interior router is
          not IPv4-aware. It cannot parse the IPv4 Echo Request, nor can it
          send an IPv4 Echo Reply. So, no reply is sent.</t>

          <t>The BFD specification for MPLS LSPs <xref target="RFC5884">RFC
          5884</xref> is defined for IPv4 as well as IPv6 versions of MPLS
          FECs (see Section 3.1 of RFC 5884). Additionally the BFD packet is
          encapsulated over UDP and specified to run over both IPv4 and IPv6
          (see Section 7 of RFC 5884).</t>

          and 5.2.1 of RFC 5085), and VCCV for BFD <xref target="RFC5885">RFC

        target="RFC3812">RFC3812</xref>, GMPLS TE MIB specification <xref

    <section title="Gap Summary">
      <t>This draft has reviewed a wide variety of MPLS features and protocols
      to determine their suitability for use on IPv6-only networks. While some
      parts of the MPLS suite will function properly without additional
      changes, gaps have been identified in others, which will need to be
      addressed with follow-on work. This section will summarize those gaps,
      along with pointers to any work-in-progress to address them.</t>
