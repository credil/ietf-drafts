Abstract

   This document presents scenarios for information-centric networking
   (ICN) which can be used to establish a common understanding about
   potential experimental setups where different approaches can be
   tested and compared against each other.  All scenarios included in
   this document are based on published literature.  That is, they have
   all been considered in one or more performance evaluation studies,
   which are already available to the community.  The scenarios selected
   aim to exercise a variety of aspects that an ICN solution can
   address.  They include a) general aspects, such as, network
   efficiency, mobility support, multicast and caching performance,
   real-time communication efficacy, disruption and delay tolerance; and
   b) ICN-specific aspects, such as, information security and trust,
   persistence, availability, provenance, and location independence.

1  Introduction

   Information-centric networking (ICN) marks a fundamental shift in
   communications and networking.  In contrast with the omnipresent and
   very successful host-centric paradigm, which is based on perpetual
   connectivity and the end-to-end principle, ICN changes the focal
   point of the network architecture from the "end host" to

INTERNET DRAFT           ICN Baseline Scenarios         January 31, 2013


   "information" (or content, or data).  In this paradigm, connectivity
   can be intermittent in general; end-host and in-network storage can
   be capitalized upon transparently, as bits in the network and on
   storage devices have exactly the same value.  Mobility and
   multiaccess are the norm.  Any-, multi-, and broadcasting are
   supported by default, and energy efficiency is a design consideration
   from the beginning.  

   Although interest in ICN is growing rapidly, ongoing work on
   different architectures, such as, for example, NetInf [NetInf], CCN
   and NDN [CCN], the publish-subscribe Internet (PSI) architecture
   [PSI], and the data-oriented architecture [DONA] is far from being
   completed.  The development phase that ICN is going through and the
   plethora of approaches to tackle the hardest problems make this a
   very active and appealing research area but, on the downside, it also
   makes it more difficult to compare different proposals on an equal
   ground.

   Ahlgren et al. note [SoA] that describing ICN architectures is akin
   to shooting a moving target.  We find that comparing these different
   approaches is often even more tricky.  It is not uncommon that
   different researchers select different performance evaluation
   scenarios, typically with good reasons, in order to highlight the
   advantages of their approach.  This should be expected to some degree
   at an early stage.  Nevertheless, we argue that certain scenarios
   seem to emerge where ICN architectures could showcase their
   superiority over current systems, in general, and against each other,
   in particular.

   This document collects several scenarios from the published ICN
   literature and aims to use them as foundation for the baseline
   scenarios to be considered by the IRTF Information-Centric Networking
   Research Group (ICNRG) in its future work.  The list of scenarios can
   obviously change, as input from the research group is received.  For
   example, this revision includes scenarios stemming from the "Internet
   of Things" and "Smart City" research areas.


2  ICN Baseline Scenarios

   This section presents a number of scenarios grouped into several
   categories.  Note that certain evaluation scenarios span across these
   categories, so the boundaries between them should not be considered
   rigid and inflexible.  The goal is that each scenario should be
   described at a sufficient level of detail so that it can serve as the
   base for comparative evaluations of different approaches.  This will
   need to include reference configurations, topologies, specifications
   of traffic mixes and traffic loads.  These specifications (or

   configurations) should preferably come as sets that describe extremes
   as well as "typical" usage scenarios.


2.1  Social Networking

   Social networking applications proliferated over the past decade
   based on overlay content dissemination systems that require large
   infrastructure investments to rollout and maintain.  Content
   dissemination is at the heart of the ICN paradigm and, therefore, we
   would expect that they are a "natural fit" for showcasing the
   superiority of ICN over traditional client-server TCP/IP-based
   systems.

   Mathieu et al. [ICN-SN], for instance, illustrate how an Internet
   Service Provider (ISP) can capitalize on CCN to deploy a short-
   message service akin to Twitter at a fraction of the complexity of
   today's systems.  Their key observation is that such a service can be
   seen as a combination of multicast delivery and caching.  That is, a
   single user addresses a large number of recipients, some of which
   receive the new message immediately as they are online at that
   instant, while others receive the message whenever they connect to
   the network.

   Along similar lines, Kim et al. [VPC] present an ICN-based social
   networking platform in which a user shares content with her/his
   family and friends without the need for centralized content server;
   see also section 2.4, below, and [CBIS].  Based on the CCN naming
   scheme, [VPC] takes a user name to represent a set of devices that
   belong to the person.  Other users in this in-network, serverless
   social sharing scenario can access the user's content not via a
   device name/address but with the user's name.  In [VPC], signature
   verification does not require any centralized authentication server. 
   Kim and Lee [VPC2] present a proof-of-concept evaluation in which
   users with ordinary smartphones can browse a list of members or
   content using a name, and download the content selected from the
   list.

   In short, in both evaluations there is no need for a classic client-
   server architecture (let alone a cloud-based infrastructure) to
   intermediate between content providers and consumers in a hub-and-
   spoke fashion.

   Earlier work by Arianfar et al. [CCR] considers a similar pull-based
   content retrieval scenario using a different architecture, pointing
   to significant performance advantages.  Although the authors consider
   a  network topology (redrawn in Fig. 1 for convenience) that has
   certain interesting characteristics, they do not explicitly address

   social networking in their evaluation scenario.  Nonetheless,
   similarities are easy to spot: "followers" (such as C0, C1, ..., and
   Cz in Fig. 1) obtain content put "on the network" (I1, ..., Im, and
   B1, B2) by a single user (e.g. Px) relying solely on network
   primitives.

   The social networking scenario aims to exercise each ICN architecture
   in terms of network efficiency, multicast support, caching
   performance and its reliance on centralized mechanisms (or lack
   thereof).


2.2  Real-time A/V Communications

   Real-time audio and video (A/V) communications include an array of
   services ranging from one-to-one voice calls to multi-party multi-
   media conferences with video and whiteboard support to augmented
   reality.  Real-time communications have been studied and deployed in
   the context of packet- and circuit-switched networks for decades. 
   The stringent quality of service requirements that this type of
   communication imposes on network infrastructure is well-known.  Some
   could argue that network primitives which are excellent for
   information dissemination are not well-suited for conversational
   services.

   Notably,  Jacobson et al. [VoCCN] presented an early evaluation where
   the performance of a VoIP call over an information-centric approach
   was compared with that of an off-the-shelf VoIP implementation using
   RTP/UTP.  The results indicated that despite the extra cost of adding

INTERNET DRAFT           ICN Baseline Scenarios         January 31, 2013


   security support in the former case, performance was virtually
   identical in the two cases evaluated in a testbed.  However, the
   experimental setup was quite rudimentary and the evaluation
   considered a single voice call only.  This scenario does illustrate
   that VoIP is feasible with at least one ICN approach, but it would
   need to be further enhanced to include more comprehensive metrics as
   well as standardized call arrival patterns, for example, following
   well-established methodologies from the quality of service/experience
   (QoS/QoE) evaluation toolbox.

   Given the wide-spread deployment of real-time A/V communications, an
   ICN approach should demonstrate more than feasibility.  For example,
   with respect to multimedia conferencing, Zhu et al. [ACT] describe
   the design of a distributed audio conference tool based on NDN.  The
   design includes ICN-based conference discovery, speakers discovery
   and voice data distribution.  The reported evaluation results point
   to gains in scalability and security.  Moreover, Chen et al. [G-
   COPSS] explore the feasibility of implementing a Massively
   Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) based on CCNx and show
   that stringent temporal requirements can be met while scalability is
   significantly improved when compared to an IP client-server system. 
   This type of work points to benefits both in the data path and the
   control path of a modern network infrastructure.

   All in all, however, the ICN research community has hitherto only
   scratched the surface of this area with respect to illustrating the
   benefits of adopting an information-centric approach as opposed to a
   host-centric one.  Arguably, more work is needed in this direction.

   In short, scenarios in this category should illustrate not only
   feasibility but reduced complexity, increased scalability,
   reliability, and capacity to meet stringent QoS/QoE requirements when
   compared to established host-centric solutions.


2.3  Mobile Networking

   IP mobility management relies on mobility anchors to provide
   ubiquitous connectivity to end-hosts as well as moving networks. 
   This is a natural choice for a host-centric paradigm that requires
   end-to-end connectivity and continuous network presence [SCES].  An
   implicit assumption in host-centric mobility management frameworks is
   that the mobile node aims at connecting to a particular peer, not at
   retrieving information [EEMN].  However, with ICN new ideas about
   mobility management should come to the forefront, which capitalize on
   the different nature of the paradigm.

   For example, Dannewitz et al. [N-Scen], consider a scenario where a
 


Pentikousis & Ohlman     Expires August 4, 2013                 [Page 6]

INTERNET DRAFT           ICN Baseline Scenarios         January 31, 2013


   multiaccess end-host can retrieve email securely using a combination
   of cellular and wireless local area network connectivity.  This
   scenario borrows elements from previous work, e.g. [DTI], and
   develops them further with respect to multiaccess.  Unfortunately,
   Dannewitz et al. [N-Scen] do not present any results demonstrating
   that an ICN approach is indeed better.  That said, the scenario is
   interesting as it considers content specific to a single user (i.e.
   her mailbox) and does point to reduced complexity.  It is also
   compatible with recent work in the Distributed Mobility Management
   (DMM) Working Group within the IETF.  Finally, Xylomenos et al.
   [PSIMob] as well as [EEMN] argue that an information-centric
   architecture can avoid the complexity of having to manage tunnels to
   maintain end-to-end connectivity as is the case with mobile anchor-
   based protocols such as Mobile IP (and its variants).

   Overall, mobile networking scenarios have not been developed in
   detail, let alone evaluated in a wide scale.  We expect that in the
   coming period more papers will address this topic, each perhaps
   proposing its own evaluation scenario.  Earlier work [mNetInf] argues
   that for mobile and multiaccess networking scenarios we need go
   beyond the current mobility management mechanisms in order to
   capitalize on the core ICN features.  They present a testbed setup
   (redrawn in Fig. 2) which can serve as the basis for other ICN
   evaluations.  Lindgren [HybICN] explores this scenario further using
   simulation for an urban setting and reports sizable gains in terms of
   reduction of object retrieval times and core network capacity use.

   access social networking and A/V applications through mobile devices.

   Mobile networking scenarios should aim to exercise service continuity
   for those applications that require it, decrease complexity and
   control signaling for the network infrastructure, as well as increase
   wireless capacity utilization by taking advantage of the broadcast
   nature of the medium.  


2.4  Infrastructure Sharing

   A key idea in ICN is that the network should secure information
   objects per se, not the communications channel that they are
   delivered over.  This means that hosts attached to an information-
   centric network can share resources in an unprecedented scale,
   especially when compared to what is possible in an IP network.  All
   devices with network access and storage capacity can contribute their
   resources increasing the value of an information-centric network
   (perhaps) much faster than Metcalfe's law.

   For example, Jacobson et al. [CBIS] argue that in ICN the "where and
   how" to obtain information are new degrees of freedom.  They
   illustrate this with a scenario involving a photo sharing application
   which takes advantage of whichever access network connectivity is
   available at the moment (WLAN, Bluetooth, and even SMS) without
   requiring a centralized infrastructure to synchronize between
   numerous devices.  It is important to highlight that since the focus
   of the communication changes, keep-alives in this scenario are simply
   unnecessary, as devices participating in the testbed network
   contribute resources in order to maintain user content consistency,
   not link state information as is the case in the host-centric
   paradigm.  This means that the notion of "infrastructure" may be
   completely different in the future. 

   Carofiglio et al., for instance, present early work on an analytical
   framework that attempts to capture the storage/bandwidth tradeoff and
   can be used as a basis for a network planning tool [SHARE].  In
   addition, Chai et al. [CL4M] explore the benefits of ubiquitous
   caching throughout an information-centric network and argue that
   "caching less can actually achieve more."  These two papers indicate
   that there is a lot of work to be done in the area of how to use
   optimally all resources available to an information-centric network.

   Scenarios in this category, therefore, would cover the
   communication/computation/storage tradeoffs that an ICN deployment
   must consider, including network planning, perhaps capitalizing on
   user-provided resources, as well as operational and economical
   aspects to illustrate the superiority of ICN over other approaches,

INTERNET DRAFT           ICN Baseline Scenarios         January 31, 2013


   including federations of IP-based Content Distribution Networks
   (CDNs).


2.5  Content Dissemination

   Content dissemination has attracted more attention than other aspects
   of ICN, perhaps due to a misunderstanding of what the first "C" in
   CCN stands for.  Decentralized content dissemination with on-the-fly
   aggregation of information sources was envisaged in [N-Scen] where
   information objects can be dynamically assembled based on
   hierarchically structured subcomponents.  For example, a video stream
   could be associated with different audio streams and subtitle sets,
   which can all be obtained from different sources.  Using the topology
   depicted in Fig. 1 as an example, an application at C1 may end up
   obtaining, say, the video content from I1, but the user-selected
   subtitles from Px.  Semantics and content negotiation, on behalf of
   the user, were also considered, e.g. for the case of popular tunes
   which may be available in different encoding formats.  Effectively
   this scenario has the information consumer issuing independent
   requests for content based on information identifiers, and stitching
   the pieces together irrespective of "where" or "how" they were
   obtained.

   Content dissemination scenarios have a large overlap with the
   scenarios described above and are explored in several papers, such as
   [DONA][PSI][PSIMob][NetInf][CCN][CBIS][CCR], just to name a few.  In
   addition, Chai et al. present a hop-by-hop hierarchical content
   resolution approach [CURLING], which employs receiver-driven
   multicast over multiple domains, advocating another content
   dissemination approach.

   Scenarios in this category abound in the literature, including stored
   and streaming A/V distribution, file distribution, mirroring and bulk
   transfers, SVN-type of services, as well as traffic aggregation.  We
   expect that in particular for content dissemination both extreme as
   well as typical scenarios can be specified drawing data from current
   CDN deployments.


2.6  Energy Efficiency

   As mentioned earlier, energy efficiency can be tackled by ICN in ways
   that it cannot in a host-centric paradigm.  For example, the work by
   Guan et al. [EECCN] indicates that CCN may be much more energy-

INTERNET DRAFT           ICN Baseline Scenarios         January 31, 2013


   Evaluating energy efficiency does not require the definition of new
   scenarios, but does require the establishment of clear guidelines so
   that different ICN approaches can be compared not only in terms of
   scalability, for example, but also in terms to power consumption. 


2.7  Delay and Disruption Tolerance

   Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) [DTN] was originally designed for
   special use cases, such as interstellar networking, use of data
   mules, and so on.  With the advent of sensor networks and peer-to-
   peer (P2P) networking between mobile nodes, DTN is becoming a more
   commonplace type of networking.  ICN does not build on the familiar
   communication abstraction of end-to-end connectivity between a set of
   nodes.  This makes it possible to include DTN support in ICN
   natively.

   Thus, it is of interest to evaluate different ICN approaches with
   respect to their delay and disruption tolerance.  Important aspects
   to be evaluated in this respect include, but are not limited to, name
   resolution, routing and forwarding in disconnected parts of the
   network; support for unidirectional links; number of round trips
   needed to complete a data transfer, and so on.


2.8  Internet of Things

   Advances in electronics miniaturization combined with low-power
   wireless access technologies (e.g., ZigBee, NFC, Bluetooth and
   others) have enabled the coupling of interconnected digital services
   with everyday objects.  As devices with sensors and actuators connect
   into the network, they become "smart objects" and form the foundation
   for the so-called Internet of Things (IoT).  IoT is expected to
   increase significantly the amount of content carried by the network
   due to machine-to-machine communication as well as novel user
   interaction possibilities.

   Yet, the full potential of IoT does not lie on simple remote access
   to smart object data.  Instead, it is the intersection of Internet
   services with the physical world that will bring about the most
   dramatic changes.  Burke [IoTEx], for instance, makes a very good
   case for creating everyday experiences using interconnected things
   through participatory sensing applications.  In this case, inherent
   ICN capabilities for data discovery, caching, and trusted
   communication are leveraged to obtain sensor information and enable
   content interexchange between mobile users, repositories, and
   applications.

INTERNET DRAFT           ICN Baseline Scenarios         January 31, 2013


   Kutscher and Farrell [IWMT] discuss the benefits that ICN can provide
   in these environments, in terms of naming, caching and optimized
   transport.  The Named Identifier scheme (ni) [NI] could be used for
   globally unique smart object identification, although an actual
   implementation report is not currently available.  Access to
   information generated by smart objects can be of varied nature and
   often vital for the correct operation of large systems.  As such,
   supporting timestamping, security, scalability, and flexibility need
   to be taken into account.

   Ghodsi et al. [NCOA] examine hierarchical and self-certifying naming
   schemes and point out that ensuring reliable and secure content
   naming and retrieval may pose stringent requirements (e.g., necessity
   for employing PKI), which can be too demanding for low-powered nodes,
   such as sensors.  That said, earlier work by Heidemann et al. [nWSN]
   shows that for dense sensor network deployments, disassociating
   sensor naming from network topology and using named content at the
   lowest level of communication in combination with in-network
   processing of sensor data is feasible in practice and can be more
   efficient than employing a host-centric binding between node locator
   and the content existing therein.

   J. Burke et al. [NDNl] describe the implementation of a lighting
   control building automation system where the security, naming and
   device discovery NDN mechanisms are leveraged to provide
   configuration, installation and management of residential and
   industrial lighting control systems.  The goal is an inherently
   resilient system, where even smartphones can be used for control.
   Naming reflects fixtures with evolved identification and node
   reaching capabilities thus simplifying bootstrapping, discovery, and
   user interaction with nodes.  The authors report that this ICN-based
   system requires less maintenance and troubleshooting than typical IP-
   based alternatives.

   IoT exposes ICN concepts to a stringent set of requirements which are
   exacerbated by the amount of nodes, as well as by the type and volume
   of information that must be handled.  A way to address this is
   [IoTScope], which tackles the problem of mapping named information to
   an object, diverting from typical centralized discovery services and
   leveraging the intrinsic ICN scalability capabilities for naming.  It
   extends the base [PURSUIT] design with hierarchically-based scopes,
   facilitating lookup, access and modifications of only the part of the
   object information that the user is interested in.  Another important
   aspect is how to efficiently address resolution and location of the
   information objects, particularly when large numbers of nodes are
   connected, as in IoT deployments.  In [ICN-DHT], Katsaros et al.
   propose a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) which is compared with DONA
   [DONA].  Their results show how topological routing information has a

   positive resolution impact, at the expense of memory and processing
   overhead.

   ICN approaches, therefore, should be evaluated with respect to their
   capacity to handle the content produced and consumed by extremely
   large numbers of diverse devices.  IoT scenarios aim to exercise ICN
   deployment from different aspects, including ICN node design
   requirements, scalability, efficient naming, transport, and caching
   of time-restricted data.


2.9  Smart City

   The rapid increase in urbanization sets the stage for the most
   compelling and challenging environments for networking.  By 2050 the
   global population will reach nine billion people, 75% of which will
   dwell in urban areas.  In order to cope with this influx, many cities
   around the world started their transformation toward the Smart City
   vision.  Smart cities will be based on the following innovation axes:
   smart mobility, smart environment, smart people, smart living, and
   smart governance.  In development terms, the core goal of a smart
   city is to become a business-competitive and attractive environment,
   while serving citizen well being [CPG].

   In a smart city, ICT plays a leading role and acts as the glue
   bringing together all actors, services, resources (and their
   interrelationships), that the urban environment is willing to host
   and provide [MVM].  ICN appears particularly suitable for these
   scenarios.  Domains of interest include intelligent transportation
   systems, healthcare, A/V communications, peer-to-peer and
   collaborative platforms for citizens, social inclusion, active
   participation in public life, e-government, safety and security,
   sensor networks, and IoT.

   Nevertheless, the road to build a real information-centric digital
   ecosystem will be long and more coordinated effort is required to
   drive innovation in this domain.  We argue that smart city needs and
   ICN technologies can trigger a virtuous innovation cycle toward
   future ICT platforms.  Recent concrete ICN-based contributions have
   been formulated for home energy management [iHEMS], geo-localized
   services [ACC], smart city services [IB], and traffic information
   dissemination in vehicular scenarios [WAK].  Some of the proposed
   ICN-based solutions are implemented in real test-beds while others
   are evaluated through simulation.

   Zhang et al. [iHEMS] propose a secure publish-subscribe architecture
   for handling the communication requirements of Home Energy Management
   Systems (HEMS).  The objective is to safely and effectively collect

   measurement and status information from household elements, aggregate
   and analyze the data, and ultimately enable intelligent control
   decisions for actuation.  They consider a simple experimental test-
   bed for their proof-of-concept evaluation, exploiting open source
   code for the ICN implementation, and emulating some node
   functionality in order to facilitate system operation.

   A different scenario is considered in [ACC], where Distributed Hash
   Tables (DHT) are proposed as a means for distributed, scalable, and
   geographically-aware service lookup in a smart city.  Also in this
   case, the ICN application is validated by considering a small scale
   test-bed: a small number of nodes are realized with simple embedded
   PCs or specific hardware boards (e.g., for some sensor nodes); other
   nodes realizing the network connecting the principal actors of the
   tests are emulated with workstations.  The proposal in [IB] draws
   from a smart city scenario (mainly oriented towards waste collection
   management) composed by sensors and moving vehicles, as well as a
   cloud computing system that supports data retrieval and storage
   operations.  The main aspects of the proposal are analyzed by
   considering a simulated scenario using open source code which is
   publicly available.  Some software applications are designed on real
   systems (e.g., PCs and smartphones).  Finally, Wang et al. [WAK]
   discuss the adoption of named data networking in vehicular (V2V)
   communication systems.  They validate their work using simulation
   based on a freely available network simulator but consider rather
   simple traffic patterns.

   Smart city scenarios aim to exercise several ICN aspects in an urban
   environment.  In particular, they can be useful to (i) analyze the
   capacity of using ICN for managing extremely large data sets; (ii)
   study ICN performance in terms of scalability in distributed
   services; (iii) verify the feasibility of ICN in a very complex
   application like vehicular communication systems; and (iv) examine
   the possible drawbacks related to privacy and security issues in
   complex networked environments.
