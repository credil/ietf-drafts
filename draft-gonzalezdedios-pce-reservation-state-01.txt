PCEP Extensions for Temporary Reservation of Computed Path Resources and
                Support for Limited Context State in PCE
             draft-gonzalezdedios-pce-reservation-state-01

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation
   functions in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.

   A limited form of statefulness is useful to improve PCE functionality
   in situations in which the local TED might not be up to date, or in
   the case of concurrent requests where most of the LSPs are computed
   before the end of the set-up of the LSPs, when the TED is updated.
   The PCC is responsible to setup or not the TE-Path computed by the
   PCE.  By providing an indication that it intends to use the resources
   on the TE-Path a PCC can help the PCE to get a more accurate dynamic
   TED view and thus the PCE can avoid suggesting the use of the same
   resources for subsequent TE LSPs.

   This document proposes an extension to the PCEP protocol to allow the
   PCC to indicate to the PCE to block or reserve the resources computed
   in a path request of a TE LSP for subsequent requests for a certain
   time and can help to reduce the number of crankbacks.

Internet-Draft   PCEP Ext for Reserv of Resources in PCE      March 2012


1.  Introduction

   According to [RFC4655], a PCE can be either stateful or stateless.
   In the former case, there is a strict synchronization between the
   PCE, the network state (in terms of topology and per link aggregated
   resource information such as unreserved bandwidth), and also the set
   of computed paths, active Label Switched Paths (LSPs) and resources
   in use in the network.

   In other words, a stateful PCE utilizes information from the TED as
   well as information about existing paths (for example, TE LSPs) in
   the network when processing new requests.  However, the maintenance
   and synchronization of a stateful LSP database (LSP-DB) can be non-
   trivial, not only because it should verify the actual establishment
   of computed paths, and because it might not be the unique element to
   compute paths.

   In addition, it can be argued that maintaining such a stateful
   database is not a function of the PCE, but rather of a Network
   Management System (NMS).

   On the other hand, a stateless PCE does not typically keep track of
   computed paths, and each set of request(s) is processed independently
   of each other, typically using a local copy of the TED.  Since a
   stateless PCE typically operates on a graph with computation
   constraints and without tracking the current state of paths,
   independent requests will be processed on the same TED graph, until
   the graph is updated.

   With a stateless PCE, there is a 'potential window of TED
   inaccuracy', where a stateless PCE may compute paths based on current
   TED information, which could be out-of-sync with the actual or
   potential network state changes given other recent PCE-computed
   paths.

   For example, some sources for this potential TED inaccuracy are:

   o  Control Plane link latencies may increase due to several factors
      such as: a) the time required for a PCC to obtain the paths after
      a successful computation, requiring several Round-Trip-Times (RTT)
      as per TCP; b) the setup delay and c) the time it takes for the
      PCE to update the local TED given IGP update times.

   o  The routing and topology dissemination protocol (i.e. OSPF-TE) ),
      which may operate with timers for LSA updates, to avoid excessive
      control plane overhead.

Internet-Draft   PCEP Ext for Reserv of Resources in PCE      March 2012


   o  Concurrent requests that arrive during the time window, between a
      response is sent and the LSP is setup and the topology changes
      flooded.  Even for very fast networks with low latency, there may
      be 'batched' requests: several path computation requests within a
      PCReq message or, in dynamic restoration without pre-planning,
      several LSPs that need to be rerouted avoiding a failed link.

   o  Local PCE contention, where the PCE needs to concurrently serve
      path computation requests and update the LSA (e.g. parsing OSPF-TE
      LSA updates). A PCE implementation may need to find a trade-off,
      when synchronizing access to the local TED: favor OSPF-TE parsing
      which means that some path computations are slightly delayed to
      allow an 'update' to be processed, or give strict priority to
      computation requests.

   In consequence, a stateless PCE may assign the same (or a subset of
   the same) resources to several requests, which may result in
   contention and degraded network performance.  The effects are
   detected late, typically during path signaling, causing path blocking
   and excessive crank-backs and retries.

   Note that, as per RFC 5440 [RFC5440], a PCC may include a set of
   previously computed paths in A given request, in order to take them
   into account, for instance, to avoid double bandwidth accounting or
   to try to minimize changes (minimum perturbation problem).

   Section 6.8 of RFC 4655 [RFC4655] suggests that a limited form of
   statefulness might be applied within an otherwise stateless PCE.  The
   PCE may retain some context from paths it has recently computed so
   that it avoids suggesting the use of the same resources for other TE
   LSPs, using heuristics / statistic or forecasting for improved
   resource (i.e. wavelength) allocation.  In other words, a given PCE
   implementation may decide to perform additional book-keeping and
   management of resources, deploying policies that prevent sub-optimal
   allocations.  For instance a PCE may compute the mean time used to
   update the TED based on the previous calculated TE-LSPs and TED
   updates.  Those kinds of mechanisms may reduce the TED inaccuracy but
   in all cases they cannot infer the PCC use of the TE-path.

   This document proposes a set of extensions to the PCEP protocol to
   allow a PCC to request a PCE to block or reserve the resources
   associated with a path computation for a given path request.  By
   reservation, it is implied that a set of resources which have been
   associated to such computation are excluded for subsequent path
   computations for a given time period.  This time-based temporary
   reservation PCE system would be a compromise between a full-blown
   stateful PCE and a stateless PCE to achieve efficiency without
   costing and excessive resource commitment associated with the



Gonzalez de Dios, et al.  Expires September 10, 2012            [Page 5]

Internet-Draft   PCEP Ext for Reserv of Resources in PCE      March 2012


   maintenance and synchronization of a stateful PCE system.  Due to the
   fact that the PCC is explicitly indicating this reservation, the PCE
   can get a more accurate view of the dynamic of the TED and thus
   increase the accuracy of its routing.  In addition having an explicit
   input may simplify how a PCE take into account the fact that the TED
   may be outdated.

   In the cases where the resource is uniquely identified in the
   topology update (such as receiving an OSPF-TE TE LSA with a bitmap
   encoded wavelength availability reflecting a change in the link
   status)), the reservation can still hold after a topology update, as
   there is a correspondence between the resource in both reservation
   and traffic engineering update, and the PCE can infer whether a given
   reserved resource has actually been committed.  Otherwise, when the
   traffic engineering update reaches the PCE, there is no way to
   distinguish the resource in the reservation among the resources shown
   in the TE update.  Thus, to assure a coherent behavior, the general
   rule is that as soon as the PCE gets updated traffic engineering
   information, all the reservations are deleted, save the the cases
   where the resource is uniquely identified and the PCE can infer
   whether a given reserved resource has actually been committed.

   Examples of resources potentially subject to reservations are: the
   bandwidth computed for the path in PSC or L2SC layers, a specific
   time slot (SDH) or tributary slot (OTN ODU-k) in TDM networks or a
   given wavelength or regenerator (WSON or OTN OCh).

   This document also presents some illustrative use cases where the PCC
   would want the PCE to retain some context or state, like multiple LSP
   restoration, and counterexamples where the PCC does not have the
   intention to immediately set up the LSP, i.e., multidomain cases
   where the PCE is probing different paths to decide the sequence of
   domains.


2.  PCEP Requirements

   This section provides a set of requirements, both for PCCs and PCEs,
   to support context awareness.

   When requesting a path computation (PCReq) to a PCE, a PCC should be
   able to indicate:

   o  Whether the resources computed in the request should be made
      unavailable for further requests.

   o  The amount of time the resources should be commited/reserved for
      the current computation request so that keeps subsequent requests



Gonzalez de Dios, et al.  Expires September 10, 2012            [Page 6]

Internet-Draft   PCEP Ext for Reserv of Resources in PCE      March 2012


      from taking.

   o  The type and granularity of the resources to be blocked in the
      request.  The type refers to the actual resources blocked such as
      path bandwidth or timeslot, wavelength, fiber...  The granularity
      refers to the possibility of not only reserving the resource
      computed for the path but whether the associated links/nodes/SRLGs
      may need to be reserved too.

   A PCE should be able to:

   o  Apply policies whether a reservation request can be applied or
      not.

   o  Compute one or more paths according to the request parameters and,
      based on the PCC indications, prevent (part of) the resources
      commited in the computed route from being used for subsequent
      computation requests for a given period.

   o  If the request is allowed, the given reservation period SHOULD be
      no less than the requested period by the PCC (e.g. for the cases
      where the PCE is only able to reserve for multiples of a given
      value).  This does not preclude the fact that, if configured by
      policy, a PCE MAY limit the period to a lower period.
      Alternatively, a PCE MAY be configured to reply with a PCEP_ERROR
      stating the cause of the failed computation/reservation.

   o  The PCE MAY decide to apply a different granularity for the
      reservation request (e.g. block a given Time Slot or wavelength
      but not the TE links).  In this case, the PCE MUST reply with the
      actual reservation.

   Note that, the means by which a PCE can perform the reservation/
   commitment of the resources are out of the scope of the present
   document but could include, for example, marking the resources as
   'reserved', applying internal exclude objects etc.

   A PCE should be able to respond (PCRep) to the PCC the following:

   o  If the resources have been effectively locked, and the effective
      allocated reservation period (if different from the requested
      one).

   o  The granularity of the reservation, which may be different from
      the requested one.

   o  Provide a means to allow a PCC to request the cancellation of an
      active reservation (for example an identification of the

      reservation to allow its cancellation).

   The PCC should be able to request the cancellation of an active
   resource reservation.


3.  PCEP Extensions (Encoding)

3.1.  Requesting a Reservation of Resources

   EDITORS NOTE: OPTION WITH PCC-ID-REQ

   A PCC that wants to indicate a PCE to temporarily reserve or block
   resources does so by including a RESERVATION object along with a
   client PCC_ID_REQ in a request within a PCReq message.

   Analogously to [RFC5886] the PCC-ID-REQ object is used to specify the
   IP address of the requesting PCC.  The PCC-ID-REQ MUST be inserted
   within a PCReq message to specify the IP address of the requesting
   PCC.  In [RFC5886] two PCC-ID-REQ objects (for IPv4 and IPv6) are
   defined.

   EDITORS NOTE: OPTION WITHOUT PCC-ID-REQ

   A PCC that wants to indicate a PCE to temporarily reserve or block
   resources does so by including a RESERVATION object in a request
   within a PCReq message.

   A PCE that processes a PCEP request with a RESERVATION object MUST
   act according to the P-bit in the object header: if the P-bit is set,
   the object MUST be treated as mandatory and the request must either
   be processed using the contents of the object or rejected as defined
   in [RFC5440].  If the P-bit is clear, the object MAY be used by the
   PCE or MAY be ignored.

   The RESERVATION object is optional in a PCEP request.  Multiple
   instances of the object MUST NOT be used on a single PCEP request and
   if a PCE finds multiple instances of the object it MUST use the first
   one and discard the rest (Editors note: alternatively, it could send
   a PCErr, OR it could allow several RESERVATION objects, and let the
   PCE choose which one will be used).  The RESERVATION object may
   appear either at an individual request level or within a SVEC.  The
   latter means that the RESERVATION object applies to all requests
   involved in the SVEC object.

   The PCReq ([RFC5440][RFC5541][RFC5557]) message is

                            [<LOAD-BALANCING>]

3.2.  Replying a reservation status

   If the PCE that receives the request applies the reservation, it
   indicates so using a RESERVATION_CONF object in the PCRep message.

   EDITOR'S NOTE: Alternatively a RESERVATION object can be used in the
   PCReq message

   The PCRep message is extended with regard to the one defined in
   [RFC5440] as follows:


   <attribute-list>::=[<LSPA>]

                             [<BANDWIDTH>]

                             [<metric-list>]

                             [<IRO>]

                             [<RESERVATION_CONF>]

   Note that the reservation applies at PATH level, and a
   RESERVATION_CONF object is included within every path in a given PCEP
   response.  This means distinct reservations for each path, which can
   be cancelled independently (Editor's Note: TDB, the PCC could
   indicate whether to have a single reservation or multiple
   reservation).

   It is RECOMMENDED that the RESERVATION_CONF object appears the last
   attribute for a Path (or as an optional object in the attribute-list
   associated to a NO_PATH object.

3.3.  Cancelling a Reservation

   A PCC that wishes to cancel a reservation may send an unsolicited
   notification to the PCE, including the identifier of the reservation.

   The PCNtf message used for one or more cancellations has no RP
   object.  As with [RFC5440], the PCNtf message MUST carry at least one
   NOTIFICATION object and MAY contain several NOTIFICATION objects
   should the PCE or the PCC intend to notify of multiple events:







Gonzalez de Dios, et al.  Expires September 10, 2012           [Page 10]

Internet-Draft   PCEP Ext for Reserv of Resources in PCE      March 2012


   <PCNtf Message>::=<Common Header>

                        <notify-list>

         <notify-list>::=<notify> [<notify-list>]

         <notify>::= <notification-list>

         <notification-list>::=<NOTIFICATION>[<notification-list>]

   NOTIFICATION objects used for the purposes of cancelling an active
   reservation MUST include the RESERVATION_ID TLV.  It is RECOMMENDED
   to use dedicated PCNtf messages for the purposes of cancelling
   reservations.

   Both the Notification-type and Notification-value are TBD by IANA

   The following Notification-type and Notification-value values are
   currently defined:

   o  Notification-type=TBD: Pending Reservation cancelled

   o  Notification-value=TBD (sug 1): PCC cancels a set of reservation
      requests.

3.4.  RESERVATION object format

   RESERVATION Object-Class is to be assigned by IANA.

   RESERVATION Object-Type is to be assigned by IANA (recommended
   value=1)

   The RESERVATION object indicates the intention of the PCC to set up

   o  Timer is the value in ms of the time that the resources should be
      blocked, encoded as a 32 bit unsigned integer.

   o  Resource Type indicates the type of resource to be reserved.  A
      value of 0 means the default resource type:

      *  Bandwidth (PSC, L2SC, ...)

      *  Time Slot (Sonet/SDH TDM)

      *  Tributary Slot (G709 OTN ODU-k TDM)

      *  Wavelength (G709 OTN OCh or WSON LSC)

   o  Bit L: if set, TE Links should be part of the reservation, and
      excluded from subsequent request.

   o  Bit N: if set, Nodes should be part of the reservation.

   o  Bit S: if set, the set of SRLG (Shared Risk Link Group) deduced
      from the associated resources (i.e., the union of SRLGs of the
      links) should be part of the reservation.

   Currently no TLVs are defined.

3.5.  RESERVATION_CONF object format

   The RESERVATION_CONF object is optional.  The RESERVATION_CONF object
   indicates that the PCE has reserved the resources of computed path to
   avoid being used by other requests.  The RESERVATION_CONF object is
   sent in the PCRep.

   The RESERVATION_CONF Object-Class is to be assigned by IANA.

   The RESERVATION_CONF Object-Type is to be assigned by IANA
   (recommended value=1)

   The format of the RESERVATION_CONF object body is:

   Timer is the value in ms of the time that the resources are blocked.
   The PCE May decide to apply a different value that the one requested
   by the PCC.

   A PCC MUST NOT send a RESERVE_RESPONSE object if the client has not
   requested a RESERVATION in the PCReq message.  A PCE MAY apply
   reservations as a means of internal policy and/or operation.

3.6.  RESERVATION_ID TLV

   The TLV indicates the reservation ID (Type TBA by IANA).

4.  Procedures

   A client that wishes to request a path computation with reservation
   shall:

   o  Include a PCC_REQ_ID and RESERVATION objects in the involved
      Request within the PCReq message.

   o  Specify what level of reservation to apply after the request.

   Upon receiving a PCReq with a Resource Reservation object, the PCE
   may:

   o  Perform the Path Computation using the local Traffic Engineering
      Database which has been extended to account for resources that
      have been marked reserved or blocked and which SHOULD not be used
      while blocked.  This includes both synchronized / dependent path
      computations via SVEC or individual Path Computations requested in
      the request_list.

   o  For the successful path computations, and for all paths
      corresponding to a given Request, determine the type of resources
      to be blocked (marked as reserved) with the granularity requested
      by the client once mapped to PCE policies.

   o  It will start a local timer associated with this blocking action.

Internet-Draft   PCEP Ext for Reserv of Resources in PCE      March 2012


   o  Send the Responses (successful or not) using PCRep message(s) and,
      where appropriate, indicate the level of reservation and
      associated period.

   o  For subsequent requests, perform path computation as detailed
      above, updating the local TED with potential new reservations.

   Whenever a timer expires, the PCE will:

   o  Remove the reservation status / blocking that affected the
      reservation (e.g. add the previously substracted unreserved
      bandwidth, mark the label, wavelength or time slot as available,
      etc).

   o  Delete any data related with this blocking action.

   Whenever a traffic engineering update reaches the PCE, the PCE will:

   o  If the reserved resource can be uniquely identified in the traffic
      engineering update, keep the reservation

   o  If the reserved resource cannot be uniquely identified in the
      traffic engineering update, delete the reservation


5.  Use cases

   This section aims to show the use cases of the proposed possibility
   to activate the limited context awareness.

5.1.  Multiple LSP restoration in a WSON network

   One of the most challenging scenarios for a PCE-based architecture is
   the one of PCE-based dynamic multiple LSP restoration in a WSON
   network without pre-planning.  In the event of a network failure
   affecting a high number of LSPs (e.g. a fiber cut), a PCE could
   potentially receive a significant amount of restoration requests in a
   short period of time from different PCCs.

   One of the various challenges in this scenario is the fact that the
   PCE needs to sequentially perform multiple independent path
   computations including routing and wavelength assignment.  In this
   scenario, a stateless PCE would rely on TED information, which could
   potentially be up-to-date before the first incoming request (e.g. in
   case the routing algorithm has disseminated the failure event), but
   will definitely be outdated for subsequent requests.

   It might be expected that the paths calculated for different



Gonzalez de Dios, et al.  Expires September 10, 2012           [Page 14]

Internet-Draft   PCEP Ext for Reserv of Resources in PCE      March 2012


   connections would rely on the same nodes, TE links or even labels
   (lambdas).  It might occur at the signaling phase that multiple
   connection requests are contending for the same resources.  After the
   eventual failure in the establishment of some of the connections,
   subsequent requests to the PCE would be triggered.  After a number of
   loops, the PCE-based restoration would be eventually solved, but the
   potential number of retries could be significantly high.

   The main issue is that the stateless PCE relied on an outdated TED to
   perform path computation.  As the subsequent connection request is
   expected to be computed immediately, there is either no time for the
   routing algorithm to update the TED after a successful signaling or
   for the signaling process to successfully finish.

   In this context, the availability of a limited context aware PCE
   could potentially solve the issue in a graceful fashion.  Each of the
   restoration path requests will have an associated Resource
   Reservation object, which will state the kind of resources and the
   amount of time they should be blocked.

   The PCE will then temporarily 'mark' the resources as blocked, so as
   not to consider them in subsequent connection requests, and thus
   avoiding the contention at the signaling phase.  The timer should be
   in line with the LSP set up time and TED time to update.

   This use case might be solved in the PCE by having a policy to
   implicitly pre-reserve the resources for a given time, which can be
   based on the mean time between a PCRep and a TED update indicating
   that the labels are not available.  The drawback of this implicit
   reservation is that path establishment time may depend and a variety
   of factor that may be strongly depend on the chosen path and
   technology used (e.g. power equalization algorithms).  In this case
   the PCC have a better view on those aspects and can provide more
   accurate view on when the TED will be updated.

5.2.  Domain path selection

   When selecting the set of domains of a multidomain path, a PCE may
   request paths to several PCEs of different domains.  Thus, the
   intention of the request is not to establish a LSP, but to obtain a
   hint on the domain path.  Thus, in this case, no Reservation Object
   would be sent.

   Here implicit policies in PCE will be inaccurate as they cannot
   determine if the PCC will setup the path or not.

Internet-Draft   PCEP Ext for Reserv of Resources in PCE      March 2012


5.3.  Multidomain path computation

   Once the domain path is known, when computing the actual path, the
   reservation object can be used.  Note that multidomain paths may take
   a long time to be established, as it involves several AS or domains
   with different behavior and policies.  Thus, it is a way to guarantee
   the availability of resources.


6.  Manageability Considerations

   Standard PCEP [RFC5440] describes various manageability
   considerations in PCEP, and most of the manageability requirements
   are already covered there.  Specific aspects are detailed in this
   section.

6.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   In addition to PCE configuration parameters listed in [RFC5440], the
   following additional parameters might be required:

   o  The ability to enable or disable reservations on the PCE.

   o  The ability to retrieve a list of reservations currently active in
      the PCE.

   o  The ability to configure which PCCs are allowed to perform
      reservations and the ability to configure limits on the timer
      periods requested.  This includes, for example, the configuration
      of IP based access lists for PCCs.

   o  The ability to configure which PCCs are allowed to perform
      reservations for single-domain and multi-domain scenarios,
      typically according to pre-defined agreements.

   o  The ability to configure which reservation granularity a given PCC
      group is able to request, and the associated action (error or
      downgrade).

   o  TDB: Advertisements of capabilities via IGP and configurability

6.2.  Information and Data Models

   A number of MIB objects have been defined for general PCEP control
   and monitoring of P2P computations in [PCEP-MIB].  For the time
   being, no extra models are considered although it could be possible
   that current means to retrieve information from the PCE be extended
   to include eventual resource reservations.

Internet-Draft   PCEP Ext for Reserv of Resources in PCE      March 2012


6.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Other than the considerations expressed in [RFC5440], a PCE could
   provide extensions to [MONITORING] to verify reservation status, and
   to obtain statistics on the system.

6.4.  Verifying Correct Operation

   There are no additional requirements for verifying the correct
   operation of the PCEP sessions.  Future MIB objects could facilitate
   verification of correct operation and reporting of reservations and
   errors.

6.5.  Requirements for Other Protocols and Functional Components

   The method for the PCC to obtain information about a PCE capable of
   reservation may include extensions to IGP protocols.

6.6.  Impact on Network Operation

   It is expected that the use of PCEP extensions specified in this
   document will not significantly increase the level of operational
   traffic.  However, mis-configured, excessive reservation requests,
   excessive reservation periods, or excessive granularity may increase
   the number of failed requests or cause the PCE to provide sub-optimal
   routes due to existing reservations.  Coarse reservations may also
   limit the resources that are available for a a PCE in order to serve
   requests.

   An excessive number of reservation requests and reservation
   cancellations may degrade server performance.  A PCE SHOULD provide a
   means to control the rate of messages with reservation, extending the
   proposed mechanism of [RFC5440].


7.  Security Considerations

   In the event of an unauthorized path computation request with
   mandatory resource reservation, or in case of a (distributed) denial
   of service attack, the subsequent state/context managed within the
   PCE may be disruptive to the network, resulting in performance
   degradation or sub-optimal computed routes.  Implementations should
   conform to the relevant security requirements of [RFC5440] that
   specifically help to control unauthorized requests.  These mechanisms
   include securing the PCEP session requests and responses using TCP
   security techniques, authenticating the PCEP requests and responses
   to ensure the message is intact and sent from an authorized node,
   providing policy control by explicitly defining which PCCs are

   allowed to perform resource reservations to the PCE and disallowing
   reservation requests that may block an excessive amount of resources.


8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains a registry of PCEP parameters.  A number of IANA
   considerations have been highlighted in previous sections of this
   document.

8.1.  RESERVATION object

8.2.  RESERVATION_CONF object

8.3.  RESERVATION_ID TLV

8.4.  PCEP Errors

   For the RESERVATION object, the default error procedures regarding
   supported unknown objects defined in [RFC5440] apply

   o  Unsupported Reservation Option

   o  Reservation Forbidden by Policy

   o  Unknown Reservation Request
