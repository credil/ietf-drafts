1.  Introduction

   The LLN On-demand Ad hoc Distance-vector Routing Protocol - Next
   Generation (LOADng) is a routing protocol, derived from AODV
   [RFC3561] and extended for use in Low power and Lossy Networks
   (LLNs).  As a reactive protocol, the basic operations of LOADng
   include generation of Route Requests (RREQs) by a LOADng Router
   (originator) for when discovering a route to a destination,
   forwarding of such RREQs until they reach the destination LOADng
   Router, generation of Route Replies (RREPs) upon receipt of an RREQ
   by the indicated destination, and unicast hop-by-hop forwarding of
   these RREPs towards the originator.  If a route is detected broken,
   i.e., if forwarding of a data packet to the recorded next hop on the
   route towards the intended destination is detected to fail, a Route
   Error (RERR) message is returned to the originator of that data
   packet.

   Compared to [RFC3561], LOADng is simplified as follows:

   o  Only the destination is permitted to respond to an RREQ;
      intermediate LOADng Routers are explicitly prohibited from
      responding to RREQs, even if they may have active routes to the
      sought destination, and all messages (RREQ or RREPs) generated by
      a given LOADng Router share a single unique, monotonically
      increasing sequence number.  This also eliminates Gratuitous RREPs
      while ensuring loop freedom.  The rationale for this
      simplification is reduced complexity of protocol operation and
      reduced message sizes.

   o  A LOADng Router does not maintain a precursor list, thus when
      forwarding of a data packet to the recorded next hop on the route
      to the destination fails, an RERR is sent only to the originator
      of that data packet.  The rationale for this simplification is an
      assumption that few overlapping routes are in use concurrently in
      a given network.

   Compared to [RFC3561], LOADng is extended as follows:

   o  Optimized flooding is supported, reducing the overhead incurred by
      RREQ generation and flooding.  If no optimized flooding operation
      is specified for a given deployment, classical flooding is used by
      default.

   o  Different address lengths are supported - from full 16 octet IPv6
      addresses over 8 octet EUI64 addresss [EUI64], 6 octet MAC
      addresses. 4 octet IPv4 addresses to shorter 1 and 2 octet
      addresses such as [RFC4944].  The only requirement is, that within
      a given routing domain, all addresses are of the same address

      length.

   o  Control messages are carried by way of the Generalized MANET
      Packet/Message Format [RFC5444].

   o  Using [RFC5444], control messages can include TLV (Type-Length-
      Value) elements, permitting protocol extensions to be developed.

   LOADng supports routing using arbitrary additive metrics, which can
   be specified as extensions to this protocol.

2.  Terminology and Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   Additionally, this document uses the notations in Section 2.1,
   Section 2.2, and Section 2.3 and the terminology defined in
   Section 2.4.

2.1.  Message and Message Field Notation

   LOADng Routers generate and process messages, each of which has a
   number of distinct fields.  For describing the protocol operation,
   specifically the generation and processing of such messages, the
   following notation is employed:

                   MsgType.field

   where:

   MsgType -  is the type of message (e.g., RREQ or RREP);

   field -  is the field in the message (e.g., OriginatorAddress).

   The different messages, their fields and their meaning are described
   in Section 6.  The encoding of messages for transmission by way of
   [RFC5444] packets/messages is described in Appendix A, and Appendix B
   illustrates the bit layout of a selection of LOADng control messages.

   The motivation for separating the high-level messages and their
   content from the low-level encoding and frame format for transmission
   is to allow discussions of the protocol logic to be separated from
   the message encoding and frame format - and, to support different
   frame formats.

Internet-Draft                   LOADng                        July 2012


2.2.  Variable Notation

   Variables are introduced into the specification solely as a means to
   clarify the description.  The following notation is used:

   MsgType.field -  If field is an unsigned integer field in the message
      MsgType, then MsgType.field is also used to represent the value of
      that field.

   bar -  A variable, usually obtained through calculations based on the
      value(s) of element(s).

2.3.  Other Notation

   This document uses the following additional notational conventions:

   a := b   An assignment operator, whereby the left side (a) is
      assigned the value of the right side (b).

   c = d   A comparison operator, returning TRUE if the value of the
      left side (c) is equal to the value of the right side (d).

2.4.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terminology:

   LOADng Router -  A router that implements this routing protocol.  A
      LOADng Router is equipped with at least one, and possibly more,
      LOADng Interfaces.

   LOADng Interface -  A LOADng Router's attachment to a communications
      medium, over which it receives and generates control messages,
      according to this specification.  A LOADng Interface is assigned
      one or more addresses.

   Link -  A link between two LOADng Interfaces exists if either can
      receive control messages, according to this specification, from
      the other.

   Message -  The fundamental entity carrying protocol information, in
      the form of address objects and TLVs.

   Link Metric -  The cost (weight) of a link between a pair of LOADng
      Interfaces.

Internet-Draft                   LOADng                        July 2012


   Route Metric -  The sum of the Link Metrics for the links that an
      RREQ or RREP has crossed.

3.  Applicability Statement

   This protocol:

   o  Is a reactive routing protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks
      (LLNs).

   o  Supports the use of optimized flooding for RREQs.

   o  Enables any LOADng Router to discover bi-directional routes to
      destinations in the routing domain, i.e., to any other LOADng
      Router, as well as hosts or networks attached to that LOADng
      Router, in the same routing domain.

   o  Supports addresses of any length, from 16 octets to a single
      octet.

   o  Is layer-agnostic, i.e., may be used at layer 3 as a "route over"
      routing protocol, or at layer 2 as a "mesh under" routing
      protocol.

   o  Supports per-destination route maintenance; if a destination
      becomes unreachable, rediscovery of that single (bi-directional)
      route is performed, without need for global topology
      recalculation.

4.  Protocol Overview and Functioning

   The objective of this protocol is for each LOADng Router to,
   independently:

   o  Discover a bi-directional route to any destination in the network.

   o  Establish a route only when there is data traffic to be sent along
      that route.

   o  Maintain a route only for as long as there is data traffic being
      sent along that route.

   o  Generate control traffic based on network events only: when a new
      route is required, or when an active route is detected broken.
      Specifically, this protocol does not require periodic signaling.

4.1.  Overview

   These objectives are achieved, for each LOADng Router, by performing
   the following tasks:

   o  When having a data packet to deliver to a destination, for which
      no tuple in the routing table exists and where the data packet
      source is local to that LOADng Router (i.e., is an address in the
      Local Interface Set or Destination Address Set of that LOADng
      Router), generate a Route Request (RREQ) encoding the destination
      address, and transmit this RREQ over all of its LOADng Interfaces.

   o  Upon receiving an RREQ, insert or refresh a tuple in the Routing
      Set, recording a route towards the originator address from the
      RREQ, as well as to the neighbor LOADng Router from which the RREQ
      was received.  This will install the Reverse Route (towards the
      originator address from the RREQ).

   o  Upon receiving an RREQ, inspect the indicated destination address:

      *  If that address is an address in the Destination Address Set or
         in the Local Interface Set of the LOADng Router, generate a
         Route Reply (RREP), which is unicast in a hop-by-hop fashion
         along the installed Reverse Route.

      *  If that address is not an address in the Destination Address
         Set or in the Local Interface Set of the LOADng Router,
         consider the RREQ as a candidate for forwarding.

   o  When an RREQ is considered a candidate for forwarding, retransmit
      it according to the flooding operation, specified for the network.

   o  Upon receiving an RREP, insert or refresh a tuple in the Routing
      Set, recording a route towards the originator address from the
      RREP, as well as to the neighbor LOADng Router, from which that
      RREP was received.  This will install the Forward Route (towards
      the originator address from the RREP).  The originator address is
      either an address from the Local Interface Set of the LOADng
      Router, or an address from its Destination Address Set (i.e., an
      address of a host attached to that LOADng Router).

   o  Upon receiving an RREP, forward it, as unicast, to the recorded
      next hop along the corresponding Reverse Route until the RREP
      reaches the LOADng Router that has the destination address from
      the RREP in its Local Interface Set or Destination Address Set.

   o  When forwarding an RREQ or RREP, update the route metric, as
      contained in that RREQ or RREP message.

Internet-Draft                   LOADng                        July 2012


   A LOADng Router generating an RREQ specifies which metric type it
   desires.  Routers receiving an RREQ will process it and update route
   metric information in the RREQ according to that metric, if they can.
   All LOADng Routers, however, will update information in the RREQ so
   as to be able to support a "hop-count" default metric.  If a LOADng
   Router is not able to understand the metric type, specified in an
   RREQ, it will update the route metric value to its maximum value, so
   as to ensure that this is indicated to the further recipients of the
   RREQ.  Once the route metric value is set to its maximum value, no
   LOADng Router along the path towards the destination may change the
   value.

4.2.  LOADng Routers and LOADng Interfaces

   A LOADng Router has a set of at least one, and possibly more, LOADng
   Interfaces.  Each LOADng Interface:

   o  Is configured with one or more addresses.

   In addition to a set of LOADng Interfaces as described above, each
   LOADng Router:

   o  Has a number of router parameters.

   o  Has an Information Base.

   o  Generates and processes RREQ, RREP, RREP_ACK and RERR messages,
      according to this specification.

4.3.  Information Base Overview

   Necessary protocol state is recorded by way of five information sets:
   the "Routing Set", the "Local Interface Set", the "Blacklisted
   Neighbor Set", the "Destination Address Set", and the "Pending
   Acknowledgment Set".

   The Routing Set contains tuples, each representing the next-hop on,
   and the cost of, a route towards a destination address.
   Additionally, the Routing Set records the sequence number of the last
   message, received from the destination.  This information is
   extracted from the message (RREQ or RREP) that generated the tuple so
   as to enable routing.  The routing table is to be updated using this
   Routing Set. (A LOADng Router may choose to use any or all
   destination addresses in the Routing Set to update the routing table,
   this selection is outside the scope of this specification.)

   The Local Interface Set contains tuples, each representing a local
   LOADng Interface of the LOADng Router.  Each tuple contains a list of

Internet-Draft                   LOADng                        July 2012


   one or more addresses of that LOADng Interface.

   The Blacklisted Neighbor Set contains tuples representing neighbor
   LOADng Routers with which unidirectional connectivity has been
   recently detected.

   The Destination Address Set contains tuples representing addresses,
   for which the LOADng Router is responsible, i.e., addresses of this
   LOADng Router, or of hosts and networks directly attached to this
   LOADng Router and which use it to connect to the routing domain.
   These addresses may in particular belong to devices which do not
   implement LOADng, and thus cannot process LOADng messages.  A LOADng
   Router provides connectivity to these addresses by generating RREPs
   in response to RREQs directed towards them.

   The Pending Acknowledgment Set contains tuples, representing
   transmitted RREPs for which an RREP_ACK is expected, but where this
   RREP_ACK has not yet been received.

   The Routing Set, the Blacklisted Neighbor Set and the Pending
   Acknowledgment Set are updated by this protocol.  The Local Interface
   Set and the Destination Address Set are used, but not updated by this
   protocol.

4.4.  Signaling Overview

   This protocol generates and processes the following routing messages:

   Route Request (RREQ) -  Generated by a LOADng Router when it has a
      data packet to deliver to a given destination, where the data
      packet source is local to that LOADng Router (i.e., is an address
      in the Local Interface Set or Destination Address Set of that
      LOADng Router), but where it does not have an available tuple in
      its Routing Set indicating a route to that destination.  An RREQ
      contains:

      *  The address (destination) to which a Forward Route is to be
         discovered by way of soliciting the LOADng Router with that
         destination address in its Local Interface Set or in its
         Destination Address Set to generate an RREP.

      *  The address for which a Reverse Route is to be installed
         (originator) by RREQ forwarding and processing, i.e., the
         source address of the data packet which triggered the RREQ
         generation.

      *  The sequence number of the LOADng Router, generating the RREQ.

Internet-Draft                   LOADng                        July 2012


      An RREQ is flooded through the network, according to the flooding
      operation specified for the network.

   Route Reply (RREP) -  Generated as a response to an RREQ by the
      LOADng Router which has the address (destination) from the RREQ in
      its Local Interface Set or in its Destination Address Set. An RREP
      is sent in unicast towards the originator of that RREQ.  An RREP
      contains:

      *  The address (originator) to which a Forward Route is to be
         installed when forwarding the RREP.

      *  The address (destination) towards which the RREP is to be sent.
         More precisely, the destination address indicates the unicast
         route which the RREP follows.

      *  The sequence number of the LOADng Router, generating the RREP.

   Route Reply Acknowledgment (RREP_ACK) -  Generated by a LOADng Router
      as a response to an RREP, in order to signal to the neighbor that
      transmitted the RREP that the RREP was successfully received.
      Receipt of an RREP_ACK indicates that the link between these two
      neighboring LOADng Routers is bidirectional.  An RREP_ACK is
      unicast to the neighbor from which the RREP has arrived, and is
      not forwarded.  RREP_ACKs are generated only in response to an
      RREP which, by way of a flag, has explicitly indicated that an
      RREP_ACK is desired.

   Route Error (RERR) -  Generated by a LOADng Router when a link on an
      active route to a destination is detected as broken by way of
      inability to forward a data packet towards that destination.  An
      RERR is unicast to the source of the undeliverable data packet.

5.  Protocol Parameters

   The following parameters are used in this specification.

5.1.  Protocol and Port Numbers

   When using LOADng as an IP routing protocol, the considerations of
   [RFC5498] apply.

5.2.  Router Parameters

Internet-Draft                   LOADng                        July 2012


   NET_TRAVERSAL_TIME -  is the maximum time that a packet is expected
      to take when traversing from one end of the network to the other.

   RREQ_RETRIES -  is the maximum number of subsequent RREQs that a
      particular LOADng Router may generate in order to discover a route
      to a destination, before declaring that destination unreachable.

   RREQ_RATELIMIT -  is the maximum number of RREQs that a particular
      LOADng Router is allowed to send per time interval.

   R_HOLD_TIME -  is the minimum time a Routing Tuple SHOULD be kept in
      the Routing Set after it was last refreshed.

   MAX_DIST -  is the value (tuple) representing the maximum possible
      distance (R_metric field).

   B_HOLD_TIME -  is the time during which the link between the neighbor
      LOADng Router and this LOADng Router MUST be considered as non-
      bidirectional, and that therefore RREQs received from that
      neighbor LOADng Router MUST be ignored after being added.
      B_HOLD_TIME should be greater than 2 x NET_TRAVERSAL_TIME x
      RREQ_RETRIES, to ensure that subsequent RREQs will reach the
      destination via a route, excluding this link.

   USE_BIDIRECTIONAL_LINK_ONLY -  is a boolean flag, which indicates if
      the LOADng Router only uses verified bi-directional links for data
      packet forwarding.  It is set by default.  If cleared, then the
      LOADng Router can use links which have not been verified to be bi-
      directional.

   RREQ_MAX_JITTER -  is the default value of MAXJITTER used in
      [RFC5148] for RREQ messages forwarded by this LOADng Router.

   MAX_HOP_COUNT -  is the maximum number of transmissions permitted by
      any RREQ or RREP message.

5.3.  Interface Parameters

   Different LOADng Interfaces (on the same or on different LOADng
   Routers) MAY employ different interface parameter values and MAY
   change their interface parameter values dynamically.  A particular
   case is where all LOADng Interfaces on all LOADng Routers within a
   given LOADng routing domain employ the same set of interface
   parameter values.

Internet-Draft                   LOADng                        July 2012


   RREP_ACK_REQUIRED -  is a boolean flag, which indicates (if set) that
      the LOADng Router is configured to expect that each RREP it sends
      be confirmed by an RREP_ACK, or, (if cleared) that no RREP_ACK is
      expected.

   RREP_ACK_TIMEOUT -  is the minimum amount of time after transmission
      of an RREP, that a LOADng Router SHOULD wait for an RREP_ACK from
      a neighbor LOADng Router, before considering the link to this
      neighbor to be unidirectional.

6.  Protocol Message Content

   The protocol messages, generated and processed by LOADng, are
   described in this section using the notational conventions described
   in Section 2.  The encoding of messages for transmission by way of
   [RFC5444] packets/messages is described in Appendix A, and Appendix B
   illustrates the bit layout of a selection of LOADng control messages.
   Unless stated otherwise, the message fields described below are set
   by the LOADng Router, which generates the message, and MUST NOT be
   changed by intermediate LOADng Routers.

6.1.  Route Request (RREQ) Messages

   A Route Request (RREQ) message has the following fields:

   RREQ.addr-length  is an unsigned integer field, encoding the length
      of the originator and destination addresses as follows:


      RREQ.addr-length := the length of an address in octets - 1


   RREQ.seq-num  is an unsigned integer field, containing the sequence
      number (see Section 8) of the LOADng Router, generating the RREQ
      message.

   RREQ.metric-type  is an unsigned integer field and specifies the type
      of metric requested by this RREQ.

   RREQ.route-metric  is a unsigned integer field, of length defined by
      RREQ.metric-type, which specifies the route metric of the route
      (the sum of the link metrics of the links), through which this
      RREQ has traveled.

   RREQ.hop-count  is an unsigned integer field and specifies the total
      number of hops which the message has traversed from the
      RREQ.originator.

Internet-Draft                   LOADng                        July 2012


   RREQ.originator  is an identifier of <address-length> + 1 octets,
      specifying the address of the LOADng Interface over which this
      RREQ was generated, and to which a route (the "reverse route") is
      supplied by this RREQ.  In case the message is generated by a
      LOADng Router on behalf of an attached host, the <originator>
      address corresponds to an address of that host, otherwise it
      corresponds to an address of the sending LOADng Interface of the
      LOADng Router.

   RREQ.destination  is an identifier of <address-length> + 1 octets,
      specifying the address to which the RREQ should be sent, i.e., the
      destination address for which a route is sought.

   The following fields of an RREQ message are immutable, i.e., they
   MUST NOT be changed during processing or forwarding of the message:
   RREQ.addr-length, RREQ.seq-num, RREQ.originator, and
   RREQ.destination.

   The following fields of an RREQ message are mutable, i.e., they will
   be changed by intermediate routers during processing or forwarding,
   as specified in Section 12.2 and Section 12.3: RREQ.metric-type,
   RREQ.route-metric, and RREQ.hop-count.

   Any additional field that is added to the message by an extension to
   this protocol, e.g., by way of TLVs, MUST be considered immutable,
   unless the extension specifically defines the field as mutable.

6.2.  Route Reply (RREP) Messages

   A Route Reply (RREP) message has the following fields:

   RREP.addr-length  is an unsigned integer field, encoding the length
      of the originator and destination addresses as follows:


      RREP.addr-length := the length of an address in octets - 1


   RREP.seq-num  is an unsigned integer field, containing the sequence
      number (see Section 8) of the LOADng Router, generating the RREP
      message.

   RREP.metric-type  is an unsigned integer field and specifies the type
      of metric, requested by this RREP.

   RREP.route-metric  is a unsigned integer field, of length defined by
      RREP.metric-type, which specifies the route metric of the route
      (the sum of the link metrics of the links) through which this RREP
      has traveled.

   RREP.ackrequired  is a boolean flag which, when set ('1'), at least
      one RREP_ACK MUST be generated by the recipient of an RREP if the
      RREP is successfully processed.  When cleared ('0'), an RREP_ACK
      MUST NOT be generated in response to processing of the RREP.

   RREP.hop-count  is an unsigned integer field and specifies the total
      number of hops which the message has traversed from the
      <originator> to the <destination>.

   RREP.originator  is an identifier of <address-length> + 1 octets,
      specifying the address for which this RREP was generated, and to
      which a route (the "forward route") is supplied by this RREP.  In
      case the message is generated on a LOADng Router on behalf of an
      attached host, the <originator> address corresponds to an address
      of that host, otherwise it corresponds to an address of the LOADng
      Interface of the LOADng Router, over which the RREP was generated.

   RREP.destination  is an identifier of <address-length> + 1 octets,
      specifying the address to which the RREP should be sent.  (I.e.,
      this address is equivalent to the <originator> address of the RREQ
      that triggered the RREP.)

   The following fields of an RREP message are immutable, i.e., they
   MUST NOT be changed during processing or forwarding of the message:
   RREP.addr-length, RREP.seq-num, RREP.originator, and
   RREP.destination.

   The following fields of an RREP message are mutable, i.e., they will
   be changed by intermediate routers during processing or forwarding,
   as specified in Section 13.2 and Section 13.3: RREP.metric-type,
   RREP.route-metric, RREP.ackrequired, and RREP.hop-count.

   Any additional field that is added to the message by an extension to
   this protocol, e.g., by way of TLVs, MUST be considered immutable,
   unless the extension specifically defines the field as mutable.

6.3.  Route Reply Acknowledgement (RREP_ACK) Messages

   A Route Reply Acknowledgement (RREP_ACK) message has the following
   fields:

   RREP_ACK.addr-length  is an unsigned integer field, encoding the
      length of the destination and originator addresses as follows:


      RREP_ACK.addr-length := the length of an address in octets - 1


   RREP_ACK.seq-num  is an unsigned integer field and contains the value
      of RREP.seq-num from the RREP for which this RREP_ACK is sent.

   RREP_ACK.destination  is an identifier of <address-length> + 1 octets
      and contains the value of the RREP.originator field from the RREP
      for which this RREP_ACK is sent.

   RREP_ACK messages are sent only across a single link and are never
   forwarded.

6.4.  Route Error (RERR) Messages

   A Route Error (RERR) message has the following fields:

   RERR.addr-length  is an unsigned integer field, encoding the length
      of RERR.destination and RERR.unreachableAddress, as follows:


      RERR.addr-length := the length of an address in octets - 1


   RERR.errorcode  is an unsigned integer field and specifies the reason
      for the error message being generated, according to Table 1.

   RERR.unreachableAddress  is an identifier of RERR.addr-length + 1
      octets, specifying an address, which has become unreachable, and
      for which an error is reported by way of this RERR message.

   RERR.destination  is an identifier of RERR.address-length + 1 octets,
      specifying the destination address of this RERR message.
      RERR.destination is, in general, the source address of a data
      packet, for which delivery to RERR.unreachableAddress failed, and
      the unicast destination of the RERR message is the LOADng Router
      which has RERR.destination listed in a Local Interface Tuple or in
      a Destination Address Tuple.

   The following fields of an RERR message are immutable, i.e., they
   MUST NOT be changed during processing or forwarding of the message:
   RERR.addr-length, RERR.errorcode, RERR.unreachableAddress, and
   RERR.destination.

   Any additional field that is added to the message by an extension to
   this protocol, e.g., by way of TLVs, MUST be considered immutable,
   unless the extension specifically defines the field as mutable.

7.  Information Base

   Each LOADng Router maintains an Information Base, containing the
   information sets necessary for protocol operation, as described in
   the following sections.  The organization of information into these
   information sets is non-normative, given so as to facilitate
   description of message generation, forwarding and processing rules in
   this specification.  An implementation may choose any representation
   or structure for when maintaining this information.

7.1.  Routing Set

   The Routing Set records the next hop on the route to each known
   destination, when such a route is known.  It consists of Routing
   Tuples:

   (R_dest_addr, R_next_addr, R_metric, R_metric_type, R_hop_count,
      R_seq_num, R_valid_time,  R_bidirectional, R_local_iface_addr)

   where:

   R_dest_addr -  is the address of the destination, either an address
      of a LOADng Interface of a destination LOADng Router, or an
      address of an interface reachable via the destination LOADng
      Router, but which is outside the routing domain.

   R_next_addr -  is the address of the "next hop" on the selected route
      to the destination.

   R_metric -  is the metric associated with the selected route to the
      destination with address R_dest_addr.

   R_metric_type -  specifies the metric type for this Routing Tuple -
      in other words, how R_metric is defined and calculated.

   R_hop_count -  is the hop count of the selected route to the
      destination with address R_dest_addr.

   R_seq_num -  is the value of the RREQ.seq-num or RREP.seq-num field
      of the RREQ or RREP which installed or last updated this tuple.
      For the Routing Tuples installed by previous hop information of
      RREQ or RREP, R_seq_num MUST be set to -1.

Internet-Draft                   LOADng                        July 2012


   R_valid_time -  specifies the time until which the information
      recorded in this Routing Tuple is considered valid.

   R_bidirectional -  is a boolean flag, which specifies if the Routing
      Tuple is verified as representing a bi-directional route.  Data
      traffic SHOULD only be routed through a routing tuple with
      R_bidirectional flag equals TRUE, unless the LOADng Router is
      configured as accepting routes without bi-directionality
      verification explicitly by setting USE_BIDIRECTIONAL_LINK_ONLY to
      FALSE.

   R_local_iface_addr -  is an address of the local LOADng Interface,
      through which the destination can be reached.

7.2.  Local Interface Set

   A LOADng Router's Local Interface Set records its local LOADng
   Interfaces.  It consists of Local Interface Tuples, one per LOADng
   Interface:

               (I_local_iface_addr_list)

   where:

   I_local_iface_addr_list -  is an unordered list of the network
      addresses of this LOADng Interface.

   The implementation MUST initialize the Local Interface Set with at
   least one tuple containing at least one address of an LOADng
   Interface.  The Local Interface Set MUST be updated if there is a
   change of the LOADng Interfaces of a LOADng Router (i.e., a LOADng
   Interface is added, removed or changes addresses).

7.3.  Blacklisted Neighbor Set

   The Blacklisted Neighbor Set records the neighbor LOADng Interface
   addresses of a LOADng Router, with which connectivity has been
   detected to be unidirectional.  Specifically, the Blacklisted
   Neighbor Set records neighbors from which an RREQ has been received
   (i.e., through which a Forward Route would possible) but to which it
   has been determined that it is not possible to communicate (i.e.,
   forwarding Route Replies via this neighbor fails, rendering
   installing the Forward Route impossible).  It consists of Blacklisted
   Neighbor Tuples:

               (B_neighbor_address, B_valid_time)

   where:

Internet-Draft                   LOADng                        July 2012


   B_neighbor_address -  is the address of the blacklisted neighbor
      LOADng Interface.

   B_valid_time -  specifies the time until which the information
      recorded in this tuple is considered valid.

7.4.  Destination Address Set

   The Destination Address Set records addresses, for which a LOADng
   Router will generate RREPs in response to received RREQs, in addition
   to its own LOADng Interface addresses (as listed in the Local
   Interface Set).  The Destination Address Set thus represents those
   destinations (i.e., hosts), for which this LOADng Router is providing
   connectivity.  It consists of Destination Address Tuples:

               (D_address)

   where:

   D_address -  is the address of a destination (a host or a network),
      attached to this LOADng Router and for which this LOADng Router
      provides connectivity through the routing domain.

   The Destination Address Set is used for generating signaling, but is
   not itself updated by signaling specified in this document.  Updates
   to the Destination Address Set are due to changes of the environment
   of a LOADng Router - hosts or external networks being connected to or
   disconnected from a LOADng Router.  The Destination Address Set may
   be administrationally provisioned, or provisioned by external
   protocols.

7.5.  Pending Acknowledgment Set

   The Pending Acknowledgment Set contains information about RREPs which
   have been transmitted with the RREP.ackrequired flag set, and for
   which an RREP_ACK has not yet been received.  It consists of Pending
   Acknowledgment Tuples:

               (P_next_hop, P_originator, P_seq_num, P_ack_timeout)

   where:

   P_next_hop -  is the address of the neighbor LOADng Interface to
      which the RREP was sent.

Internet-Draft                   LOADng                        July 2012


   P_originator -  is the address of the originator of the RREP.

   P_seq_num -  is the RREP.seq-num field of the sent RREP.

   P_ack_timeout -  is the time after which the tuple MUST be discarded.

8.  LOADng Router Sequence Numbers

   Each LOADng Router maintains a single sequence number, which must be
   included in each RREQ or RREP message it generates.  Each LOADng
   Router MUST make sure that no two messages (both RREQ and RREP) are
   generated with the same sequence number, and MUST generate sequence
   numbers such that these are monotonically increasing.  This sequence
   number is used as freshness information for when comparing routes to
   the LOADng Router having generated the message.

   However, with a limited number of bits for representing sequence
   numbers, wrap-around (that the sequence number is incremented from
   the maximum possible value to zero) will occur.  To prevent this from
   interfering with the operation of the protocol, the following MUST be
   observed.  The term MAXVALUE designates in the following the largest
   possible value for a sequence number.  The sequence number S1 is said
   to be "greater than" (denoted '>') the sequence number S2 if:

      S2 < S1 AND S1 - S2 <= MAXVALUE/2 OR

      S1 < S2 AND S2 - S1 > MAXVALUE/2

9.  Route Maintenance

   Tuples in the Routing Set are maintained by way of five different
   mechanisms:

   o  RREQ/RREP exchange, specified in Section 12 and Section 13.

   o  Data traffic delivery success.

   o  Data traffic delivery failure.

   o  External signals indicating that a tuple in the Routing Set
      necessitates updating.

   o  Information expiration.

   Routing Tuples in the Routing Set contain a validity time, which
   specifies the time until which the information recorded in this tuple
   is considered valid.  After this time, the information in such tuples
   is to be considered as invalid, for the processing specified in this



Clausen, et al.         Expires January 15, 2013               [Page 21]

Internet-Draft                   LOADng                        July 2012


   document.

   Routing Tuples for actively used routes (i.e., routes via which
   traffic is currently transiting) SHOULD NOT be removed, unless there
   is evidence that they no longer provide connectivity - i.e., unless a
   link on that route has broken.

   To this end, one or more of the following mechanisms (non-exhaustive
   list) MAY be used:

   o  If a lower layer mechanism provides signals, such as when delivery
      to a presumed neighbor LOADng Router fails, this signal MAY be
      used to indicate that a link has broken, trigger early expiration
      of a Routing Tuple from the Routing Set, and to initiate Route
      Error Signaling (see Section 14).  Conversely, absence of such a
      signal when attempting delivery MAY be interpreted as validation
      that the corresponding Routing Tuple(s) are valid, and their
      R_valid_time refreshed correspondingly.  Note that when using such
      a mechanism, care should be taken to prevent that an intermittent
      error (e.g., an incidental wireless collision) triggers corrective
      action and signaling.  This depends on the nature of the signals,
      provided by the lower layer, but can include the use of a
      hysteresis function or other statistical mechanisms.

   o  Conversely, for each successful delivery of a packet to a neighbor
      or a destination, if signaled by a lower layer or a transport
      mechanism, or each positive confirmation of the presence of a
      neighbor by way of an external neighbor discovery protocol, MAY be
      interpreted as validation that the corresponding Routing Tuple(s)
      are valid, and their R_valid_time refreshed correspondingly.  Note
      that when refreshing a Routing Tuple corresponding to a
      destination of a data packet, the Routing Tuple corresponding to
      the next hop toward that destination SHOULD also be refreshed.

   Furthermore, a LOADng Router may experience that a route currently
   used for forwarding data packets is no longer operational, and must
   act to either rectify this situation locally (Section 13) or signal
   this situation to the source of the data packets for which delivery
   was unsuccessful (Section 14).

   If generation of an RERR message is triggered by failure to deliver a
   data packet to a next-hop, a LOADng Router MUST generate an RERR
   message, as specified in Section 14, and MAY attempt an alternative
   delivery method for that (and subsequent) data packets, e.g., as
   specified in [I-D.DFF].

10.  Unidirectional Link Handling

   Each LOADng Router MUST monitor the bidirectionality of the links to
   its neighbors and set the R_bidirectional flag of related routing
   tuples when processing Route Replies (RREP).  To this end, one or
   more of the following mechanisms MAY be used (non exhaustive list):

   o  If a lower layer mechanism provides signals, such as when delivery
      to a presumed neighbor LOADng Router fails, this signal MAY be
      used to detect that a link to this neighbor is broken or is
      unidirectional; the LOADng Router MUST then blacklist the
      neighbor, see Section 10.1.

   o  If a mechanism such as NDP [RFC4861] is available, the LOADng
      Router MAY use it.

   o  RREP_ACK message exchange, as described in Section 15.

   o  Upper-layer mechanisms, such as transport-layer acknowledgments,
      MAY be used to detect unidirectional or broken links.

   When a LOADng Router detects, via one of these mechanisms, that a
   link to a neighbor LOADng Router is unidirectional or broken, the
   LOADng Router MUST blacklist this neighbor, see Section 10.1.
   Conversely, if a LOADng Router detects via one of these mechanisms
   that a previously blacklisted LOADng Router has a bidirectional link
   to this LOADng Router, it MAY remove it from the blacklist before the
   <B_valid_time> of the corresponding tuple.

10.1.  Blacklist Usage

   The Blacklist is maintained according to Section 7.3.  When a
   neighbor LOADng Router is detected to have a unidirectional link to
   the LOADng Router, it is blacklisted, i.e., a tuple
   (B_neighbor_address, B_valid_time) is created thus:

   o  B_neighbor_address := the address of the blacklisted neighbor
      LOADng Router

   o  B_valid_time := current_time + B_HOLD_TIME

   When a neighbor LOADng Router is blacklisted, i.e., when there is a
   corresponding (B_neighbor_address, B_valid_time) tuple in the
   Blacklisted Neighbor Set, it is temporarily not considered as a
   neighbor, and thus:

   o  Every RREQ received from this neighbor LOADng Router MUST be
      discarded;

11.  Common Rules for RREQ and RREP Messages

   RREQ and RREP messages, both, supply routes between their recipients
   and the originator of the RREQ or RREP message.  The two message
   types therefore share common processing rules, and differ only in the
   following:

   o  RREQ messages are multicast or broadcast, intended to be received
      by all LOADng Routers in the network, whereas RREP messages are
      all unicast, intended to be received only by LOADng Routers on a
      specific route towards a specific destination.

   o  Receipt of an RREQ message by a LOADng router, which has the
      RREQ.destination address in its Local Interface Set or Destination
      Address Set MUST trigger the procedures for generation of an RREP
      message.

   o  Receipt of an RREP message with RREP.ackrequired set MUST trigger
      generation of an RREP_ACK message.

   For the purpose of the processing description in this section, the
   following additional notation is used:

   received-route-metric  is a variable, representing the route metric,
      as included in the received RREQ or RREP message, see Section 16.

   used-metric-type  is a variable, representing the type of metric used
      for calculating received-route-metric, see Section 16.

   previous-hop  is the address of the LOADng Router, from which the
      RREQ or RREP message was received.

   >  is the comparison operator for sequence numbers, as specified in
      Section 8.

   MSG  is a shorthand for either a RREQ or RREP message, used for when
      accessing message fields in the description of the common RREQ and
      RREP message processing in the following subsections.

   link-metric  is a variable, representing the link metric between this
      LOADng Router and the LOADng Router from which the RREQ or RREP
      message was received, as calculated by the receiving LOADng
      Router, see Section 16.

   route-metric  is a variable, representing the route metric, as
      included in the received RREQ or RREP message, plus the link-
      metric for the link, over which the RREQ or RREP was received,
      i.e., the total route cost from the originator to this LOADng

      Router.

11.1.  Identifying Invalid RREQ or RREP Messages

   A received RREQ or RREP message is invalid, and MUST be discarded
   without further processing, if any of the following conditions are
   true:

   o  The address length specified by this message (i.e., MSG.addr-
      length + 1) differs from the length of the address(es) of this
      LOADng Router.

   o  The address contained in the <originator> field is an address of
      this LOADng Router.

   o  There is a tuple in the Routing Set where:

      *  R_dest_addr = MSG.originator

      *  R_seq_num > MSG.seq-num

   o  For RREQ messages only, an RREQ MUST be considered invalid if the
      previous-hop is blacklisted (i.e., its address is in a tuple in
      the Blacklisted Neighbor Set, see Section 10.1).

   A LOADng Router MAY recognize additional reasons for identifying that
   an RREQ or RREP message is invalid for processing, e.g., to allow a
   security protocol to perform verification of integrity check values
   and prevent processing of unverifiable RREQ or RREP message by this
   protocol.

11.2.  RREQ and RREP Message Processing

   A received, and valid, RREQ or RREP message is processed as follows:

   1.  Included TLVs are processed/removed/updated according to their
       specification.

   2.  If MSG.metric-type is known to this LOADng Router, then:

       *  Set the variable used-metric-type to the value of MSG.metric-
          type.

       *  Determine the link metric over the link over which the message
          was received, according to used-metric-type, and set the
          variable link-metric to the calculated value.

       *  Compute the route metric to MSG.originator according to used-
          metric-type by adding link-metric to the received-route-metric
          advertised by the received message, and set the variable
          route-metric to the calculated value.

   3.  Otherwise, if MSG.metric-type is unknown to this LOADng Router:

       *  Set the variable used-metric-type to HOP_COUNT.

       *  Set the variable route-metric to its maximum value, see
          Section 16.

   4.  Find the Routing Tuple (henceforth, Matching Routing Tuple)
       where:

       *  R_dest_addr = MSG.originator

       *  R_metric_type = used-metric-type

   5.  If no Matching Routing Tuple is found, then create a new Matching
       Routing Tuple (the "reverse route" for RREQ messages or "forward
       route" for RREP messages) with:

       *  R_dest_addr := MSG.originator

       *  R_next_addr := previous-hop

       *  R_metric_type := used-metric-type

       *  R_metric := MAX_DIST

       *  R_hop_count := MSG.hop-count

       *  R_seq_num := -1

       *  R_valid_time := current time + R_HOLD_TIME

       *  R_bidirectional := FALSE

       *  R_local_iface_addr := the address of the LOADng Interface
          through which the message was received.

   6.  The Matching Routing Tuple, existing or new, is compared to the
       received RREQ or RREP message:

       1.  If

           +  R_seq_num = MSG.seq-num; AND

           +  R_metric > route-metric

           OR

           +  R_seq_num = MSG.seq-num; AND

           +  R_metric = route-metric; AND

           +  R_hop_count > MSG.hop-count

           OR

           +  R_seq_num < MSG.seq-num

           Then:

           7.  The message is used for updating the Routing Set. The
               Routing Tuple, where:

               -  R_dest_addr = MSG.originator; AND

               -  R_metric_type = used-metric-type

               is updated thus:

               -  R_next_addr := previous-hop

               -  R_metric := route-metric

               -  R_hop_count := MSG.hop-count

               -  R_seq_num := MSG.seq-num

               -  R_valid_time := current time + R_HOLD_TIME

               -  R_bidirectional := TRUE, if the message being
                  processed is an RREP.

           8.  If previous-hop is not equal to MSG.originator, and if
               there is no Matching Routing Tuple in the Routing Set
               with R_dest_addr = previous-hop, create a new Matching
               Routing Tuple with:

               -  R_dest_addr := previous-hop

               -  R_next_addr := previous-hop

           9.  The Routing Tuple with R_dest_addr = previous-hop,
               existing or new, is updated as follows

               -  R_metric_type := used-metric-type

               -  R_metric := link-metric

               -  R_hop_count := 1

               -  R_seq_num := -1

               -  R_valid_time := current time + R_HOLD_TIME

               -  R_bidirectional := TRUE, if the processed message is
                  an RREP, otherwise FALSE.

               -  R_local_iface_addr := the address of the LOADng
                  Interface through which the message was received.

       2.  Otherwise, the RREQ or RREP message is not processed further,
           and is not considered for forwarding.

12.  Route Requests (RREQs)

   Route Requests (RREQs) are generated by a LOADng Router when it has
   data packets to deliver to a destination, where the data packet
   source is local to that LOADng Router (i.e., is an address in the
   Local Interface Set or Destination Address Set of that LOADng
   Router), but for which the LOADng router has no matching tuple in the
   Routing Set. If the router parameter USE_BIDIRECTIONAL_LINK_ONLY is
   TRUE, a RREQ is furthermore generated even if a matching tuple in the
   Routing Set exists, but where that tuple has R_bidirectional set to
   FALSE.  The RREQ is transmitted on all the LOADng Routers LOADng
   Interfaces, i.e., to all directly reachable neighbor LOADng Routers.

   After originating an RREQ, a LOADng Router waits for a corresponding
   RREP.  If no such RREP is received within 2*NET_TRAVERSAL_TIME
   milliseconds, the LOADng Router MAY issue a new RREQ for the sought
   destination (with an incremented seq_num) up to a maximum of
   RREQ_RETRIES times.  A LOADng Router SHOULD NOT originate more than
   RREQ_RATELIMIT RREQs per second.  A LOADng Router MAY use mechanisms
   such as exponential backoff to determine the rate at which it
   originates RREQs.

12.1.  RREQ Generation

   An RREQ message is generated according to Section 6 with the
   following content:

   o  RREQ.addr-length set to the length of the address, as specified in
      Section 6;

   o  RREQ.metric-type set to the desired metric type;

   o  RREQ.seq-num set to the next unused sequence number, maintained by
      this LOADng Router;

   o  RREQ.hop-count := 0;

   o  RREQ.destination := the address to which a route is sought;

   o  RREQ.originator := one address of the LOADng Interface of the
      LOADng Router that generates the RREQ.  If the LOADng Router is
      generating RREQ on behalf of a host connected to this LOADng
      Router, the source address of the data packet, generated by that
      host, is used;

   o  RREQ.route-metric := 0.

12.2.  RREQ Processing

   On receiving an RREQ message, a LOADng Router MUST process the
   message according to this section:

   1.  If the message is invalid for processing, as defined in
       Section 11.1, the message MUST be discarded without further
       processing.  The message is not considered for forwarding.

   2.  Otherwise, the message is processed according to Section 11.2.

   3.  If RREQ.hop-count equals MAX_HOP_COUNT, the message is not
       considered for forwarding.

   4.  If RREQ.destination is not listed in I_local_iface_addr_list of
       any Local Interface Tuple, or does not correspond to D_address of
       any Destination Address Tuple of this LOADng Router, then the
       message is considered for forwarding according to Section 12.3.

   5.  Otherwise, an the RREP generation process in Section 13.1 MUST be
       applied.  The RREQ is not considered for forwarding.

12.3.  RREQ Forwarding

   For the purpose of the description in this section, the following
   additional notation is used:

   received-route-metric  is a variable, representing the route metric,
      as included in the received RREQ message, see Section 16.

   used-metric-type  is a variable, representing the metric used for
      calculating received-route-metric, see Section 16.

   link-metric  is a variable, representing the link metric between this
      LOADng Router and the LOADng Router, from which the RREQ message
      was received, as calculated based on the received message or on
      other mechanisms, see Section 16.

   An RREQ, considered for forwarding, MUST be updated as follows, prior
   to it being transmitted:

   1.  RREQ.metric-type := used-metric-type (as set in Section 11.2)

   2.  RREQ.hop-count := RREQ.hop-count + 1

   3.  RREQ.route-metric := received-route-metric + link-metric

       Where link-metric is calculated according to the specification of
       RREQ.metric-type.

   An RREQ MIST be forwarded according to the flooding operation,
   specified for the network.  This MAY be by way of classic flooding, a
   reduced relay set mechanism such as [RFC6621], or any other
   information diffusion mechanism such as [RFC6206].  Care must be
   taken that NET_TRAVERSAL_TIME is chosen so as to accommodate for the
   maximum time that may take for an RREQ to traverse the network,
   accounting for in-router delays incurring due to or imposed by such
   algorithms.

12.4.  RREQ Transmission

   RREQs, initially generated or forwarded, are sent to all neighbor
   LOADng Routers.  The source address of the RREQ MUST be an address of
   the LOADng Interface over which the RREQ is sent.

   When an RREQ is transmitted, all receiving LOADng Routers will
   process the RREQ message and as a consequence consider the RREQ
   message for forwarding at the same, or at almost the same, time.  If
   using data link and physical layers that are subject to packet loss
   due to collisions, such RREQ messages SHOULD be jittered as described

   in [RFC5148], in order to avoid such losses.

13.  Route Replies (RREPs)

   Route Replies (RREPs) are generated by a LOADng Router in response to
   an RREQ, and is sent by the LOADng Router which has, in either its
   Destination Address Set or in its Local Interface Set, the address
   from RREP.destination.  RREPs are sent, hop by hop, in unicast
   towards the originator of the RREQ, in response to which the RREP was
   generated, along the Reverse Route installed by that RREQ.  A LOADng
   Router, upon forwarding an RREP, installs the Forward Route towards
   the RREP.destination.

   Thus, with forwarding of RREQs installing the Reverse Route and
   forwarding of RREPs installing the Forward Route, bi-directional
   routes are provided between the RREQ.originator and RREQ.destination.

13.1.  RREP Generation

   At least one RREP MUST be generated in response to a (set of)
   received RREQ messages with identical (RREP.originator, RREP.seq-
   num).  An RREP MAY be generated immediately as a response to each
   RREQ processed, in order to provide shortest possible route
   establishment delays, or MAY be generated after a certain delay after
   the arrival of the first RREQ, in order to use the "best" received
   RREQ (e.g., received over the lowest-cost route) but at the expense
   of longer route establishment delays.  A LOADng Router MAY generate
   further RREPs for subsequent RREQs received with the same
   (RREP.originator, RREP.seq-num) pairs, if these indicate a better
   route, at the expense of additional control traffic being generated.
   In all cases, however, the content of an RREP is as follows:

   o  RREP.addr-length set to the length of the address, as specified in
      Section 6;

   o  RREP.seq-num set to the next unused sequence number, maintained by
      this LOADng Router;

   o  RREP.metric-type set to the same value as the RREQ.metric-type in
      the corresponding RREQ;

   o  RREP.hop-count := 0;

   o  RREP.destination := the address to which this RREP message is to
      be sent; this corresponds to the RREQ.originator from the RREQ
      message, in response to which this RREP message is generated;

Internet-Draft                   LOADng                        July 2012


   o  RREP.originator := the address of the LOADng Router, generating
      the RREP.  If the LOADng Router is generating an RREP on behalf of
      the hosts connected to it, or on behalf of one of the addresses
      contained in the LOADng Routers Destination Address Set, the host
      address is used.

   o  RREP.route-metric := 0

   The RREP so generated is transmitted according to Section 13.4.

13.2.  RREP Processing

   On receiving an RREP message, a LOADng Router MUST process the
   message according to this section:

   1.  If the message is invalid for processing, as defined in
       Section 11.1, the message MUST be discarded without further
       processing.  The message is not considered for forwarding.

   2.  Otherwise, the message is processed according to Section 11.2.

   3.  If RREP.ackrequired is set, an RREP_ACK message MUST be sent to
       the previous-hop, according to Section 15.1.

   4.  If the RREP.hop-count is equal to MAX_HOP_COUNT, the message is
       not considered for forwarding.

   5.  If RREP.destination is not listed in I_local_iface_addr_list of
       any Local Interface Tuple and does not correspond to D_address of
       any Destination Address Tuple of this LOADng Router, the RREP
       message is considered for forwarding according to Section 13.3.

13.3.  RREP Forwarding

   For the purpose of the description in this section, the following
   additional notation is used:

   received-route-metric  is a variable, representing the route metric,
      as included in the received RREP message, see Section 16.

   used-metric-type  is a variable, representing the metric used for
      calculating received-route-metric, see Section 16.

   link-metric  is a variable, representing the link metric between this
      LOADng Router and the LOADng Router, from which the RREP message
      was received, as calculated based on the received message or on
      other mechanisms, see Section 16.

Internet-Draft                   LOADng                        July 2012


   An RREP message, considered for forwarding, MUST be updated as
   follows, prior to it being transmitted:

   1.  RREP.metric-type := used-metric-type (as set in Section 11.2)

   2.  RREP.hop-count := RREP.hop-count + 1

   3.  RREP.route-metric := received-route-metric + link-metric

       Where link-metric is calculated according to the specification of
       RREP.metric-type.

   4.  The RREP is transmitted, according to Section 13.4.

   The RREP message is then unicast to the next hop towards the
   <destination> indicated in the RREP.

13.4.  RREP Transmission

   An RREP is, ultimately, destined for the LOADng Router which has the
   address listed in the RREP.destination field in either of its Local
   Interface Set, or in its Destination Address Set. The RREP is
   forwarded in unicast towards that LOADng Router.  The RREP MUST,
   however, be transmitted so as to allow it to be processed in each
   intermediate LOADng Router to:

   o  Install proper forward routes; AND

   o  Permit that RREP.hop-count be updated to reflect the route.

   RREP Transmission is accomplished by the following procedure:

   1.  Find the Routing Tuple (henceforth, the "Matching Routing Tuple")
       in the Routing Set, where:

       *  R_dest_addr = RREP.destination

       *  R_metric_type = RREP.metric-type

       *  R_metric is minimum

   2.  Find the Local Interface Tuple (henceforth, "Matching Interface
       Tuple), where:

       *  I_local_iface_addr_list contains R_local_iface_addr from the
          Matching Routing Tuple

Internet-Draft                   LOADng                        July 2012


   3.  If RREP_ACK_REQUIRED is set for the LOADng Interface, identified
       by the Matching Interface Tuple:

       *  Create a new Pending Acknowledgment Tuple with:

          +  P_next_hop := R_next_addr from the Matching Routing Tuple

          +  P_originator := RREP.originator

          +  P_seq_num := RREP.seq-num

          +  P_ack_timeout := current_time + RREP_ACK_TIMEOUT

       *  Set RREP.ackrequired to true

   4.  Otherwise:

       *  Set RREP.ackrequired to false.

   5.  The RREP is transmitted over the LOADng Interface, identified by
       the Matching Interface Tuple to the neighbor LOADng Router,
       identified by R_next_addr from the Matching Routing Tuple.

14.  Route Errors (RERRs)

   If a LOADng Router fails to deliver a data packet to a next hop or a
   destination, and if neither the source nor destination address of
   that data packet is not in the Destination Address Set of that LOADng
   Router, it MUST generate a Route Error (RERR).  This RERR MUST be
   sent along the Reverse Route towards the source of the data packet
   for which delivery was unsuccessful (to the last LOADng Router along
   the Reverse Route, if the data packet was originated by a host behind
   that LOADng Router).

   The following definition is used in this section:

   o  "EXPIRED" indicates that a timer is set to a value clearly
      preceding the current time (e.g., current time - 1).

14.1.  Identifying Invalid RERR Messages

   A LOADng Router MAY recognize reasons, external to this
   specification, for identifying that an RERR message is invalid for
   processing, e.g., to allow a security protocol to perform
   verification of signatures and prevent processing of unverifiable
   RERR message by this protocol.

14.2.  RERR Generation

   A packet with an RERR message is generated by the LOADng Router,
   detecting the link breakage, with the following content:

   o  RERR.error-code := the error code corresponding to the event
      causing the RERR to be generated, from among those recorded in
      Table 1;

   o  RERR.addr-length := the length of the address, as specified in
      Section 6;

   o  RERR.destination := the source address from the unsuccessfully
      delivered data packet, towards which the RERR is to be sent.

   o  RERR.unreachableAddress := the destination address from the
      unsuccessfully delivered data packet.

14.3.  RERR Processing

   For the purpose of the processing description below, the following
   additional notation is used:

   previous-hop  is the address of the LOADng Router, from which the
      RERR was received.

   Upon receiving an RERR, a LOADng Router MUST perform the following
   steps:

   1.  Included TLVs are processed/removed/updated according to their
       specification.

   2.  Find the Routing Tuple (henceforth "matching Routing Tuple") in
       the Routing Set where:

       *  R_dest_addr = RERR.unreachableAddress

       *  R_next_addr = previous-hop

   3.  If no matching Routing Tuple is found, the RERR is not processed
       further, and is not considered for forwarding.

   4.  Otherwise, if one matching Routing Tuple is found, this matching
       Routing Tuple is updated as follows:

       *  R_valid_time := EXPIRED

       The RERR message is, then, considered for forwarding.

14.4.  RERR Forwarding

   An RERR is, ultimately, destined for the LOADng Router which has, in
   either its Destination Address Set or in its Local Interface Set, the
   address from RERR.originator.

   An RERR, considered for forwarding is therefore processed as follows:

   1.  Find the Destination Address Tuple (henceforth, matching
       Destination Address Tuple) in the Destination Address Set where:

       *  D_address = RERR.destination

   2.  If one or more matching Destination Address Tuples are found, the
       RERR message is discarded and not retransmitted, as it has
       reached the final destination.

   3.  Otherwise, find the Local Interface Tuple (henceforth, matching
       Local Interface Tuple) in the Local Interface Set where:

       *  I_local_iface_addr_list contains RERR.destination.

   4.  If a matching Local Interface Tuple is found, the RERR message is
       discarded and not retransmitted, as it has reached the final
       destination.

   5.  Otherwise, if no matching Destination Address Tuples or Local
       Interface Tuples are found, the RERR message is transmitted
       according to Section 14.5.

14.5.  RERR Transmission

   An RERR is, ultimately, destined for the LOADng Router which has the
   address listed in the RERR.destination field in either of its Local
   Interface Set, or in its Destination Address Set. The RERR is
   forwarded in unicast towards that LOADng Router.  The RERR MUST,
   however, be transmitted so as to allow it to be processed in each
   intermediate LOADng Router to:

   o  Allow intermediate LOADng Routers to update their Routing Sets,
      i.e., remove tuples for this destination.

   RERR Transmission is accomplished by the following procedure:

   1.  Find the Routing Tuple (henceforth, the "Matching Routing Tuple")
       in the Routing Set, where:





Clausen, et al.         Expires January 15, 2013               [Page 36]

Internet-Draft                   LOADng                        July 2012


       *  R_dest_addr = RERR.destination

   2.  Find the Local Interface Tuple (henceforth, "Matching Interface
       Tuple), where:

       *  I_local_iface_addr_list contains R_local_iface_addr from the
          Matching Routing Tuple

   3.  The RERR is transmitted over the LOADng Interface, identified by
       the Matching Interface Tuple to the neighbor LOADng Router,
       identified by R_next_addr from the Matching Routing Tuple.

15.  Route Reply Acknowledgments (RREP_ACKs)

   A LOADng Router MUST signal in a transmitted RREP that it is
   expecting an RREP_ACK, by setting RREP.ackrequired flag in the RREP.
   When doing so, the LOADng Router MUST also add a tuple (P_next_hop,
   P_originator, P_seq_num, P_ack_timeout) to the Pending Acknowledgment
   Set, and set P_ack_timeout to RREP_ACK_TIMEOUT, as described in
   Section 13.4.

   The following definition is used in this section:

   o  "EXPIRED" indicates that a timer is set to a value clearly
      preceding the current time (e.g., current time - 1).

15.1.  RREP_ACK Generation

   Upon reception of an RREP message with the RREP.ackrequired flag set,
   a LOADng Router MUST generate at least one RREP_ACK and send this
   RREP_ACK in unicast to the neighbor which originated the RREP.

   An RREP_ACK message is generated by a LOADng Router with the
   following content:

   o  RREP_ACK.addr-length := the length of the address, as specified in
      Section 6;

   o  RREP_ACK.seq-num := the value of the RREP.seq-num field of the
      received RREP;

   o  RREP_ACK.destination := RREP.originator of the received RREP.

15.2.  RREP_ACK Processing

   On receiving an RREP_ACK from a LOADng neighbor LOADng Router, a
   LOADng Router MUST do the following:

Internet-Draft                   LOADng                        July 2012


   1.  Find the Routing Tuple (henceforth, Matching Routing Tuple)
       where:

       *  R_dest_addr = previous-hop;

       The Matching Routing Tuple is updated as follows:

       *  R_bidirectional := TRUE

   2.  If a Pending Acknowledgement Tuple (henceforth, Matching Pending
       Acknowledgement Tuple) exists, where:

       *  P_next_hop is the address of the LOADng neighbor LOADng Router
          from which the RREP_ACK was received.

       *  P_originator = RREP_ACK.destination

       *  P_seq_num = RREP_ACK.seq-num

       Then the RREP has been correctly acknowledged.  The Matching
       Pending Acknowledgement Tuple is updated as follows:

       *  P_ack_timeout := EXPIRED

15.3.  RREP_ACK Forwarding

   An RREP_ACK is intended only for a specific direct neighbor, and MUST
   NOT be forwarded.

15.4.  RREP_ACK Transmission

   An RREP_ACK is transmitted, in unicast, to the neighbor LOADng Router
   from which the RREP was received.

16.  Metrics

   This specification enables the use of different metrics for when
   calculating route metrics.

   Metrics as defined in LOADng are additive, and the routes that are to
   be created are those with the minimum sum of the metrics along that
   route.

16.1.  Specifying New Metrics

   When defining a metric, the following considerations SHOULD be taken
   into consideration:




Clausen, et al.         Expires January 15, 2013               [Page 38]

Internet-Draft                   LOADng                        July 2012


   o  The definition of the R_metric field, as well as the value of
      MAX_DIST.

17.  Security Considerations

   Currently, this protocol does not specify any special security
   measures.  As a reactive routing protocol, this protocol is a
   potential target for various attacks.  Various possible
   vulnerabilities are discussed in this section.

   By way of (i) enabling inclusion of TLVs and (ii) permitting that
   LOADng recognizes external reasons for rejecting RREQ, RREP, RREP_ACK
   and RERR messages, development of security measures, appropriate for
   a given deployment, is however supported.  This architecture is a
   result of the observation that with respect to security in LOADng
   routed networks, "one size rarely fits all".  This, as LOADng
   deployment domains have varying security requirements ranging from
   "unbreakable" to "virtually none", depending on, e.g., physical
   access to the network, or on security available on other layers.  The
   virtue of this approach is that LOADng routing protocol
   specifications (and implementations) can remain "generic", with
   extensions providing proper deployment-domain specific security
   mechanisms.

17.1.  Confidentiality

   This protocol floods Route Requests (RREQs) to all the LOADng Routers
   in the network, when there is traffic to deliver to a given
   destination.  Hence, if used in an unprotected network (such as an
   unprotected wireless network):

   o  Part of the network topology is revealed to anyone who listens,
      specifically (i) the identity (and existence) of the source LOADng
      Router; (ii) the identity of the destination; and (iii) the fact
      that a path exists between the source LOADng Router and the LOADng
      Router from which the RREQ was received.

   o  The network traffic patterns are revealed to anyone who listens to
      the LOADng control traffic, specifically which pairs of devices
      communicate.  If, for example, a majority of traffic originates
      from or terminates in a specific LOADng Router, this may indicate
      that this LOADng Router has a central role in the network.

   This protocol also unicasts Route Replies (RREPs) from the
   destination of an RREQ to the originator of that same RREQ.  Hence,
   if used in an unprotected network (such as an unprotected wireless
   network):




Clausen, et al.         Expires January 15, 2013               [Page 39]

Internet-Draft                   LOADng                        July 2012


   o  Part of the network topology is revealed to anyone who is near or
      on the unicast path of the RREP (such as within radio range of
      LOADng Routers on the unicast path in an unprotected wireless
      network), specifically that a path from the originator (of the
      RREP) to the destination (of the RREP) exists.

   Finally, this protocol unicasts Route Errors (RERRs) when an
   intermediate LOADng Router detects that the path from a source to a
   destination is no longer available.  Hence, if used in an unprotected
   network (such as an unprotected wireless network):

   o  A disruption of the network topology is revealed to anyone who is
      near or on the unicast path of the RERR (such as within radio
      range of LOADng Routers on the unicast path in an unprotected
      wireless network), specifically that a path from the originator
      (of the RERR) to the destination (of the RERR) has been disrupted.

   This protocol signaling behavior enables, for example, an attacker to
   identify central devices in the network (by monitoring RREQs) so as
   to target an attack, and (by way of monitoring RERRs) to measure the
   success of an attack.

17.2.  Integrity

   A LOADng Router injects topological information into the network by
   way of transmitting RREQ and RREP messages, and removes installed
   topological information by way of transmitting RERR messages.  If
   some LOADng Routers for some reason, malice or malfunction, inject
   invalid control traffic, network integrity may be compromised.
   Therefore, message authentication is recommended.

   Different such situations may occur, for instance:

   1.  A LOADng Router generates RREQ messages, pretending to be another
       LOADng Router;

   2.  A LOADng Router generates RREP messages, pretending to be another
       LOADng Router;

   3.  A LOADng Router generates RERR messages, pretending to be another
       LOADng Router;

   4.  A LOADng Router generates RERR messages, indicating that a link
       on a path to a destination is broken;

   5.  A LOADng Router forwards altered control messages;





Clausen, et al.         Expires January 15, 2013               [Page 40]

Internet-Draft                   LOADng                        July 2012


   6.  A LOADng Router does not forward control messages;

   7.  A LOADng Router forwards RREPs and RREQs, but does not forward
       unicast data traffic;

   8.  A LOADng Router "replays" previously recorded control messages
       from another LOADng Router.

   Authentication of the originator LOADng Router for control messages
   (for situations 1, 2 and 3) and on individual links announced in the
   control message (for situation 2 and 4) may be used as a
   countermeasure.  However, to prevent routers from repeating old (and
   correctly authenticated) information (situation 8), temporal
   information is required, requiring a router to positively identify
   such a delayed message.

   In general, integrity check values and other required security
   information may be transmitted as a separate Message Type, or
   signatures and security information may be transmitted within the
   control messages, using the TLV mechanism.  Either option permits
   that "secured" and "unsecured" routers can coexist in the same
   network, if desired.

   Specifically, if LOADng is used on the IP layer, the authenticity of
   entire control messages can be established through employing IPsec
   authentication headers, whereas authenticity of individual links
   (situations 2 and 4) require additional security information to be
   distributed.

17.3.  Channel Jamming and State Explosion

   A reactive protocol, LOADng control messages are generated in
   response to network events.  For RREQs, such an event is that a data
   packet is present in a router which does not have a route to the
   destination of the data packet, or that the router receives an RERR
   message, invalidating a route.  For RREPs, such an event is receipt
   of an RREQ corresponding to a destination owned by the LOADng Router.
   A router, forwarding an RREQ or an RREP records state, for the
   reverse and forward routes, respectively.  If some routers for some
   reason, malice or malfunction, generates excessive RREQ, RREP or
   RERRs, otherwise correctly functioning LOADng Routers may fall victim
   to either "indirect jamming" (being "tricked" into generating
   excessive control traffic) or an explosion in the state necessary for
   maintaining protocol state (potentially, exhausting the available
   memory resources).

   Different such situations may occur, for instance:




Clausen, et al.         Expires January 15, 2013               [Page 41]

Internet-Draft                   LOADng                        July 2012


   1.  A router, within a short time, generates RREQs to an excessive
       amount of destinations in the network (possibly all destinations,
       possibly even destinations not present in the network), causing
       intermediate routers to allocate state for the forward routes.

   2.  A router generates excessively frequent RREQs to the same
       (existing) destination, causing the corresponding LOADng Router
       to generate excessive RREPs.

   3.  A router generates RERRs for a destination to the source LOADng
       Router for traffic to that destination, causing that LOADng
       Router to flood renewed RREQs.

   For situation 1, the state required for recording forward and/or
   reverse routes may exceed the memory available in the intermediate
   LOADng Routers - to the detriment of being able of recording state
   for other routes.  This, in particular, if a LOADng Router generates
   RREQs for destinations "not present in the network".

   A router which, within a short time, generates RREPs to an excessive
   amount of destinations in the network (possibly all destinations,
   possibly even destinations not present in the network), will not have
   the same network-wide effect: an intermediate router receiving an
   RREP for a destination for which no reverse route exists will neither
   attempt forwarding the RREP nor allocate state for the forward route.

   For situations 1, 2, and 3, a possible countermeasure is to rate-
   limit the number of control messages that a LOADng Router forwards on
   behalf of another LOADng Router.  Such a rate limit should take into
   consideration the expected normal traffic for a given LOADng
   deployment.  Authentication may furthermore be used so as to prohibit
   a LOADng Router from forwarding control traffic from any non-
   authenticated router (with the assumption being that an authenticated
   router is not expected to exhibit such rogue behavior).

17.4.  Interaction with External Routing Domains

   This protocol does provide a basic mechanism for a LOADng Router to
   be able to discover routes to external routing domains: a LOADng
   Router configured to "own" a given set of addresses will respond to
   RREQs for destinations with these addresses, and can - by whatever
   protocols governing the routing domain wherein these addresses exist
   - provide paths to these addresses.

   When operating routers connecting a LOADng domain to an external
   routing domain, destinations inside the LOADng domain can be injected
   into the external domain, if the routing protocol governing that
   domain so permits.  Care MUST be taken to not allow potentially

   insecure and untrustworthy information to be injected into the
   external domain.

   In case LOADng is used on the IP layer, a RECOMMENDED way of
   extending connectivity from an external routing domain to a LOADng
   routed domain is to assign an IP prefix (under the authority of the
   routers/gateways connecting the LOADng routing domain with the
   external routing domain) exclusively to that LOADng routing domain,
   and to statically configure gateways to advertise routes for that
   prefix into the external domain.  Within the LOADng domain, gateways
   SHOULD only generate RREPs for destinations which are not part of
   that prefix; this is in particularly important if a gateway otherwise
   provides connectivity to "a default route".

18.  LOADng Specific IANA Considerations

18.1.  Error Codes

   IANA is requested to create a new registry for Error Codes, with
   initial assignments and allocation policies as specified in Table 1.

Appendix A.  LOADng Control Messages using RFC5444

   This section presents how the abstract LOADng messages, used
   throughout this specification, are mapped into RFC5444 messages.

A.1.  RREQ-Specific Message Encoding Considerations

   This protocol defines, and hence owns, the RREQ Message Type.  Thus,
   as specified in [RFC5444], this protocol generates and transmits all
   RREQ messages, receives all RREQ messages and is responsible for
   determining whether and how each RREQ message is to be processed
   (updating the Information Base) and/or forwarded, according to this
   specification.  Table 2 specifies how RREQ messages are mapped into
   [RFC5444]-elements.

A.4.  RERR Message Encoding

   This protocol defines, and hence owns, the RERR Message Type.  Thus,
   as specified in [RFC5444], this protocol generates and transmits all
   RERR messages, receives all RERR messages and is responsible for
   determining whether and how each RERR message is to be processed
   (updating the Information Base) and/or forwarded, according to this
   specification.  Table 5 describes how RERR Messages are mapped into
   [RFC5444]-elements.
