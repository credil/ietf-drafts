             IPv6 Extensions for Route Target Distribution
                draft-ietf-idr-bgp-ipv6-rt-constrain-04

Abstract

   The current route target distribution specification described in
   RFC4684 defines Route Target NLRIs of maximum length of 12 bytes.
   The IPv6 specific Route Target extended community is defined in
   [RFC5701] as length of 20 bytes.  Since the current specification
   only supports prefixes of maximum length of 12 bytes, the lack of an
   IPv6 specific Route Target reachability information may be a problem
   when an operator wants to use this application in a pure IPv6
   environment.  This document defines an extension that allows BGP to
   exchange longer length IPv6 Route Target prefixes.

1.  Introduction

   The current constrained route distribution specification defined in
   [RFC4684] supports prefixes with a maximum length of 12 bytes.  The
   prefix length needs to be extended to support the IPv6 specific Route
   Target extended community defined in [RFC5701] which is 20 bytes in
   length.  This document defines an extension to the current
   constrained route distribution specification that allows BGP speakers
   to distribute longer length Route Target prefixes.  A new BGP
   capability known as BGP IPv6 Constrained Route Target capability is
   defined as part of extension that allows an exchange of longer length
   Route Target prefixes.  BGP speakers that do not exchange this
   capability MUST use Route Target NLRIs of maximum length of 12 bytes.
   In this way, the current extension would preserve the backward
   compatibility with [RFC4684].

2.  BGP IPv6 Constrained Route Target Capability

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Extensions for RT Distribution       August 2013


   The "BGP IPV6 Constrained Route Target Capability" is a new BGP
   capability [RFC5492].  The Capability code for this capability is
   specified in the IANA Considerations section of this document.  The
   Capability length field of this capability is zero.

   By advertising this capability to a peer, a BGP speaker conveys to
   the peer that the speaker support the longer length Route Target
   prefixes and the related procedures described in this document.

3.  IPv6 Constrained Route Target NLRI Advertisements

   Route Target membership NLRI is advertised in BGP UPDATE messages
   using the MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI attributes as defined in
   [RFC4760].  The NLRI field in the MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI
   is a prefix of 0 to 24 octets, encoded as defined in Section 4 of
   [RFC4760] for all the constrained route distribution.

   This prefix is structured as follows:

   +-------------------------------+
   | origin as        (4 octets)   |
   +-------------------------------+
   | route target  (8 or 20 octets)|
   ~                               ~
   |                               |
   +-------------------------------+


   Except for the default route target, which is encoded as a zero-
   length prefix, the minimum prefix length is 32 bits.  As the origin-
   AS field cannot be interpreted as a prefix.

   Route targets can then be expressed as prefixes, where, for instance,
   a prefix would encompass all route target extended communities
   assigned by a given Global Administrator [RFC4360] and [RFC5701].
   Alternatively, route target prefixes could be aggregated however if
   done so, then only the Local Administrator field of the Route Target
   can be aggregated.  Route Target Type and the Global Administrator
   Route Target fields MUST not be aggregated.

   The default route target can be used to indicate to a peer the
   willingness to receive all VPN route advertisements such as, for
   instance, the case of a route reflector speaking to one of its PE
   router clients.

4.  IANA Considerations

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Extensions for RT Distribution       August 2013


   This document defined the IPV6 Constrained Route Target Capability
   for BGP.  The Capability code needs to be assigned by the IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   This extension to [RFC4684] does not change the underlying security
   issues inherent in the existing BGP and [RFC4684].
