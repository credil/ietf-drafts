                 Auto-Configuration of Designated VLANs
                  draft-zhang-trill-dvlan-auto-01.txt

Abstract

   When RBridges are connected by a bridge LAN link, they need to select
   out a Designated VLAN to be used for PDU exchange and TRILL data
   forwarding.

   This document specifies an approach for RBridges to automatically
   determine a Designated VLAN on a LAN link for default configured
   RBridges. When a DVLAN has to be changed for the sake of a better
   connectivity of a LAN link, RBridges can change their Designated VLAN
   with least traffic interruption according to the soft Designated VLAN
   change method.

INTERNET-DRAFT          DVLAN Auto-Configuration           July 11, 2012


1. Introduction

   Designated VLAN (DVLAN) plays an important role in both TRILL
   protocol operations and data forwarding. According to [RFC6325] and
   [RFC6327], the DVLAN of a link is determined by the desired DVLAN of
   the DRB on this link. The desired DVLAN of an RBridge is usually
   manually configured by operators. If the desired DVLAN is not
   configured on an RBridge, its DVLAN is set to be the numerically
   lowest enabled VLAN ID, which is VLAN 1 for a default configuration
   RBridge [RFC6325]. TRILL frames except some TRILL Hellos are sent on
   a LAN link out tagged with the Designated VLAN. 

   This document specifies an approach for default configured RBridges
   on a link to automatically select a DVLAN. Under the circumstance
   that an RBrdige joins in a link whose DVLAN is not enabled on the
   attaching port of this RBridge while the intersection of enabled
   VLANs of this RBridge and the other RBridges connected by this link
   is non-empty, a DVLAN change of this link is necessary for the
   interconnection of these RBridges. The soft DVLAN change approach
   specified in this document enable RBridges to establish backup
   adjacencies for a backup DVLAN in advance. Then the DVLAN can be
   changed to the backup DVLAN without waiting for the time-consuming
   adjacency transition processes, therefore RBridges can shift their
   DVLAN with least traffic interruption.

   Familiarity with [RFC6325], [RFC6327] is assumed in this document. As
   in [RFC6325], in this document the word "link" means a "bridged LAN",
   unless otherwise qualified. 

1.1. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. Designated VLAN Determination

   According to [RFC6327], the desired Designated VLAN SHOULD be
   manually configured for each RBridge by operators. The desired DVLAN
   of the DRB becomes the DVLAN for the local link. If the desired DVLAN
   of the DRB is not configured, by default, the desired DVLAN will be
   set to be the enabled VLAN of the DRB with the numerically lowest ID.
   This section offers a substitute approach for DRB to automatically
   elect a DVLAN on a local link when its desired DVLAN is not
   configured. The desired DVLAN can therefore be selected adaptively
   according to the practical VLAN configuration of RBridges on a link.

2.1. Designated VLAN for Most RBridges

INTERNET-DRAFT          DVLAN Auto-Configuration           July 11, 2012


   Through the exchange of TRILL-Hello frames, the DRB can figure out
   which VLAN is enabled by the largest number of its neighbors on a
   local link. If there are more than one such VLAN IDs, they are
   compared as unsigned integers with the smaller magnitude being
   considered higher priority. According to this "Most Enabled VLAN
   First (MEVF)" policy, a VLAN will be selected as the desired DVLAN of
   the DRB. Take Figure 2.1 as an example. RB1 is the elected DRB on the
   local link. VLAN 20 is enabled on all the three RBridges while VLAN
   10 is enabled only on two RBridges, RB1 and RB2. RB1 should announce
   in its Hellos that VLAN 20 is its desired DVLAN.

   The policy to choose the VLAN supported by most RBridges achieves the
   best connectivity of a local link. If the DVLAN is determined
   arbitrarily, this best connectivity cannot be guaranteed. For
   example, in Figure 2.1, if RB1 is configured to use VLAN 10 as its
   desired DVLAN, RB3 will be disconnected from the local link.

2.2. DVLAN Initialization

   If desired DVLAN is configured on an RBridge port, this RBridge MUST
   announce this configured DVLAN as its desired DVLAN in its TRILL
   Hellos. Nevertheless, if desired DVLAN is not configured, the desired
   DVLAN will be determined adaptively according to the following
   process.

   When an RBridge port comes up and its desired DVLAN is not
   configured, it will wait for two Hello intervals before it announces
   its desired DVLAN to other neighbors. According to [RFC6325], this
   RBridge will consider itself to be DRB on that port before a TRILL-
   Hello from a higher priority RBridge is received. After two Hello
   intervals, the DRB should have been elected on the link the port
   attached to. The DRB should have figured out which VLAN should be
   designated for the local link according to the policy defined in
   Section 2.1. This DRB will begin to set that VLAN as its desired

   designated VLAN and announce it in its subsequent Hellos, which will
   cause other RBridges on the local link set their DVLANs as the DRB
   desired.  

3. Soft DVLAN Change

   When a new RBridge RBi joins in a local link and its enabled VLAN set
   does not include the DVLAN in use, it cannot establish connectivity
   with other RBridges on this link. It is possible that the set of
   enabled VLANs of RBi has a non-null intersection with the set of
   enabled VLANs of all the other RBridges. The connectivity can be
   established if the DRB change its DVLAN to be one of this
   intersection. Since the desired DVLAN of DRB is manually configured
   in conventional TRILL, operators have to be involved to reconfigure
   the desired DVLAN of the DRB. If the DVLAN is changed in this way,
   all the adjacencies of the local link will move out from the Report
   state and it may take a long time for all these adjacencies to move
   to Report state again. This means an interruption to the TRILL Data
   forwarding of the local link [RFC6327]. 

   This section aims to provide a substitute approach for RBridges to
   shift their DVLAN with least traffic interruption.

3.1. Backup DVLAN

   When RBi joins in the local link and announces its enabled VLANs
   which do not list the DVLAN being used on this link. The DRB knows a
   DVLAN change is needed in order to establish connectivity with RBi.
   It need to figure out which VLAN should be used as the new DVLAN
   according to MEVF policy. The DRB should never choose a VLAN as the
   new DVLAN if there is any RBridge on the local link except RBi that
   does not enable this DVLAN. In other words, when a DRB need to change
   the DVLAN in order to achieve the connectivity to an RBridge that
   joins the local link, it should not break the existing connectivity
   of an RBridge on the local link due to the DVLAN change.

   Before the DRB really shifts to this new DVLAN, this DVLAN will be
   treated as a backup DVLAN. The following sub-TLV is used by the DRB
   to notify its neighbors the backup DVLAN.

3.2. Adjacency on Backup DVLAN

   When RBridges on the local link receives Hellos with the B-DVLAN sub-
   TLV, they MUST begin to create and maintain backup states of
   adjacencies with other neighbors on the local link according to the
   adjacency state machinery defined in Section 3 of [RFC6327], using
   the backup DVLAN as the DVLAN. All other RBridges on this link should
   add the SNPA of the attached port of RBi as a nexthop, which will
   open up an entry in the adjacency table of all other RBridges. RBi
   should also add entries in its adjacency table for the other
   RBridges. TRILL Hello frames out tagged with the DVLAN will be tagged
   with the backup DVLAN as well. However, a backup adjacency will not
   be announced even it moves to the Report state. The TRILL data
   forwarding in progress on the local link will not be interrupted. The
   report of backup adjacencies will be postponed until the DRB change
   the backup DVLAN as its desired DVLAN. 

   When all the backup states of adjacencies move to the Report state,
   the DRB begins to send out Hellos with the backup DVLAN as its
   desired DVLAN. This will trigger all RBridges on the local link
   change to use the backup DVLAN as the new DVLAN and the backup
   adjacencies are announced in LSPs. Since the backup adjacencies are
   established in advance and can be announced in LSPs immediately after

   the DVLAN shift take place, the time-consuming adjacency transitions
   are avoided. RBridges on the local link do not have to set the non-
   Designated VLAN Hello Holding timer and Designated VLAN Hello Holding
   timer as that in Section 4.2.3 of [RFC6327].

3.3. DVLAN Change Restriction

   A DRB should make a DVLAN change only for the sake of increasing
   TRILL campus connectivity. The following event SHOULD be a certain
   event when the DRB makes the DVLAN change. 

      S0.   The DRB receives a TRILL Hello (other an A0 event [RFC6327])
            that is not on the DVLAN and the DVLAN is not included in
            this TRILL Hello while the intersection of Enabled VLANs of
            all RBridges on the local link is non-empty.

   Therefore, under the event that an RBridge is physically disconnected
   from a local link, the DRB will not trigger a DVLAN change. 

   When an RBridge joins a local link and this RBridge has a higher
   priority to be the DRB of current DRB, this will cause a change in
   DRB. Under such circumstance, the current DRB should refrain from
   DVLAN change.

4. Security Considerations

   This document raises no new security issues for IS-IS.

5. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create a new registry in IIH for the B-DVLAN
   sub-TLV defined in Section 3.1.
