Abstract

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   the Internet community.  In particular, it describes managed objects
   for modeling of the Path Computation Element communication Protocol
   (PCEP)for communications between a Path Computation Client (PCC)and a
   Path Computation Element (PCE), or between two PCEs when path-key-
   based confidentiality in inter-domain path computation is requested.

Internet-Draft              PCEP PATHKEY MIB                   July 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) defined in [RFC4655] is an entity
   that is capable of computing a network path or route based on a
   network graph, and applying computational constraints.  A Path
   Computation Client (PCC) may make requests to a PCE for paths to be
   computed.

   The PCE communication protocol (PCEP) is designed as a communication
   protocol between PCCs and PCEs for path computations and is defined
   in [RFC5440].

   If confidentiality is required between domains, Path-Key-Based
   mechanism is described in [RFC5520].  For preserving the
   confidentiality of the "Confidential Path Segment (CPS)"; the PCE
   returns a path containing a loose hop in place of the segment that
   must be kept confidential.

   [PCEP-MIB] defines a portion of the MIB for use with network
   management protocols in the Internet community that can be used to
   manage PCEP communications between a PCC and a PCE, or between two
   PCEs.  This memo describes MIB for path-key-based confidentiality in
   inter-domain path computations.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC4655], [RFC5440]
   and [RFC5520].  The following terminology is used in this document.

   Domain:  Any collection of network elements within a common sphere of
      address management or path computational responsibility.  Examples
      of domains include Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) areas and
      Autonomous Systems (ASs).

   IGP:  Interior Gateway Protocol.  Either of the two routing
      protocols, Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) or Intermediate System
      to Intermediate System (IS-IS).

3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

4.  PCEP Pathkey MIB Module Architecture

   The PCEP Pathkey MIB will contain the following information:

   o  PCEP Pathkey counters, timers and configurations

   o  PCEP Pathkey table of Confidential Path Segment (CPS) related
      information.

   The PCEP Pathkey MIB has no role when PCEP peer is PCC.

4.1.  Relations to other MIB modules

   The PCEP Pathkey MIB imports the following textual conventions from
   the MPLS-TC-STD-MIB defined in [RFC3811]:

   o  MplsPathIndex

   o  TeHopAddressType

   o  TeHopAddress

   o  TeHopAddressUnnum

   The PCEP Pathkey MIB imports the following textual conventions from
   the INET-ADDRESS-MIB defined in [RFC4001]:

   o  InetAddressType

   o  InetAddress

5.  Example of the PCEP PathKey MIB module usage

   In this section we provide an example to showcase the relationship
   between pcePcepPathKeyTable and pcePcepPathKeyHopTable described in
   Section 6.  While this example is not meant to illustrate every
   permutation of the MIB, nor in its entirety, it is intended as an aid
   to understand some of the key concepts.  It is meant to be read after
   going through the MIB itself.

      pcePcepPathKeyTable of the PCEP-PATHKEY-MIB module:
      {
                  pcePcepPathKey                 (4512),
                  pcePcepPathKeyCPSIndex         (1),
                  pcePcepPathKeyReqSrcAddrType   ipv4 (1),
                  pcePcepPathKeyReqSrcAddr       (1.1.1.1),
                  pcePcepPathKeyRequestId        (10),
                  pcePcepPathKeyRetrieved        (1),
                  pcePcepPathKeyRtrAddrType      ipv4 (1),
                  pcePcepPathKeyRtrAddr          (2.2.2.2),
                  pcePcepPathKeyDiscardTime      (10),
                  pcePcepPathKeyReuseTime        (30)
      }

      Entries of pcePcepPathKeyHopTable of the PCEP-PATHKEY-MIB module:
      {
                  pcePcepPathKeyHopListIndex     1,
                  pcePcepPathKeyHopIndex         1,
                  pcePcepPathKeyHopAddrType      ipv4 (1),
                  pcePcepPathKeyHopIpAddr        "192.168.100.1",
                  pcePcepPathKeyHopIpPrefixLen   32,
                  pcePcepPathKeyHopAddrUnnum     0,
      }
      {
                  pcePcepPathKeyHopListIndex     1,
                  pcePcepPathKeyHopIndex         2,
                  pcePcepPathKeyHopAddrType      ipv4 (1),
                  pcePcepPathKeyHopIpAddr        "192.168.100.2",
                  pcePcepPathKeyHopIpPrefixLen   32,
                  pcePcepPathKeyHopAddrUnnum     0
      }

   The pcePcepPathKeyTable is the table for all the Path-Keys generated
   by PCE.  To access the CPS hidden by path-key pcePcepPathKey (4512),
   index pcePcepPathKeyCPSIndex (1) is used in pcePcepPathKeyHopTable to
   find the hop list (pcePcepPathKeyHopListIndex).  To access each hop
   of the path another index pcePcepPathKeyHopIndex is used along with
   pcePcepPathKeyHopListIndex.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:


        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------
        pcePcepPathkeyMIB         { mib-2 XXX }

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

8.  Security Considerations

   [PCEP-MIB] describes the security consideration related to the PCE
   MIB module, which are applicable to PCE Path-Key MIB defined in this
   document.  Further [RFC5520] describes various security consideration
   when dealing with Path-Key.  Since this MIB contains confidential
   path segment, care should be taken to maintain the confidentiality
   during SNMP MIB operations.
