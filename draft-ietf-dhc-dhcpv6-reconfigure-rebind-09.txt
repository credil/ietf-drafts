            Rebind Capability in DHCPv6 Reconfigure Messages
            draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-reconfigure-rebind-09.txt

Abstract

   This document updates RFC 3315 to allow the Rebind message type to
   appear in the Reconfigure Message option of a Reconfigure message,
   which extends the Reconfigure message to allow a DHCPv6 server to
   cause a DHCPv6 client to send a Rebind message.  The document also
   clarifies how a DHCPv6 client responds to a received Reconfigure
   message.

Internet-Draft       DHCPv6 Reconfigure with Rebind        December 2011


1.  Introduction

   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] allows a server to send an unsolicited Reconfigure
   message to a client.  The client's response to a Reconfigure message,
   according to section 19 of RFC 3315 is either a Renew or an
   Information-Request message, depending on the contents of the msg-
   type field in the Reconfigure Message option of the Reconfigure
   message.  If the client sends a Renew message, it includes a Server
   Identifier option in the Renew message to specify the server that
   should respond to the Renew message.  The RFC 3315 specification is
   only suitable for the scenarios that client would communicate with
   the same DHCPv6 servers.

   There are also scenarios that the client must communicate with a
   different server: for example, a network administrator may choose to
   shut down a DHCPv6 server and move these clients who most recently
   communicated with it to another different server.  Hence, this
   document expands the allowed values of the msg-type field with in
   reconfiguration message to allow the server to indicate the client to
   send a Rebind message, which does not include a Server Identifier
   option and allows any server to respond to the client.

   RFC 3315 does not specify that a Reconfigure message must be sent
   from the server with which the client most recently communicated, and
   it does not specify which server the client should identify with a
   Server Identifier option when the client responds to the Reconfigure
   message.  This document clarifies that the client should send a Renew
   message in response to a Reconfigure message with a Server Identifier
   option identifying the same server that the client would have
   identified if the client had sent the Renew message after expiration
   of T1.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses IPv6 and DHCPv6 terms as defined in section 4 of
   [RFC3315].


3.  The Reconfigure Message option of the DHCPv6 Reconfigure Message

   This section modifies section 22.19 of RFC 3315 to allow the
   specification of the Rebind message in a Reconfigure message.

Internet-Draft       DHCPv6 Reconfigure with Rebind        December 2011


   A server includes a Reconfigure Message option in a Reconfigure
   message to indicate to the client whether the client responds with a
   Renew, an Information-request, or a Rebind message.

   The format of this option is:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |      OPTION_RECONF_MSG        |         option-len            |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |    msg-type   |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   option-code         OPTION_RECONF_MSG (19).
   option-len          1.
   msg-type            5 for Renew message, 6 for Rebind, 11 for
                       Information-request message.


4.  Server Behavior

   This section updates specific text in sections 19.1, 19.2 and 19.3 of
   RFC 3315.

   The server MUST include a Reconfigure Message option (as defined in
   Section 3) to select whether the client responds with a Renew
   message, a Rebind message or an Information-Request message.

   The Reconfigure message causes the client to initiate a Renew/Reply,
   a Rebind/Reply message exchange or an Information-request/Reply
   message exchange.  The server interprets the receipt of a Renew, a
   Rebind or an Information-request message (whichever was specified in
   the original Reconfigure message) from the client as satisfying the
   Reconfigure message request.

   The server retransmits a Reconfigure message specifying a Rebind
   message in the same way as described in section 19.1.2 of RFC 3315.

   In response to a Rebind message, the server generates and sends a
   Reply message to the client as described in sections 18.2.4 and
   18.2.8, including options for configuration parameters.

   The server MAY include options containing the IAs and new values for
   other configuration parameters in the Reply message, even if those
   IAs and parameters were not requested in the Renew message from the
   client.

5.  Client Behavior

   This section updates specific text in section 19.4 of RFC 3315.

   Upon receipt of a valid Reconfigure message, the client responds with
   a Renew message, a Rebind message or an Information-request message
   as indicated by the Reconfigure Message option (as defined in
   Section 3).  The client ignores the transaction-id field in the
   received Reconfigure message.  While the transaction is in progress,
   the client silently discards any Reconfigure messages it receives.

   When responding to a Reconfigure, the client creates and sends the
   Rebind message in exactly the same manner as outlined in section
   18.1.4 of RFC 3315, with the exception that the client copies the
   Option Request option and any IA options from the Reconfigure message
   into the Rebind message.

   If a client is currently sending Rebind messages, as described in
   section 18.1.4 of RFC 3315, the client ignores any received
   Reconfigure messages.

   The client uses the same variables and retransmission algorithm as it
   does with Renew, Rebind or Information-request messages generated as
   part of a client-initiated configuration exchange.  See sections
   18.1.3, 18.1.4 and 18.1.5 of RFC 3315 for details.  If the client
   does not receive a response from the server by the end of the
   retransmission process, the client ignores and discards the
   Reconfigure message.


6.  Clarification of section 19.4.2, RFC 3315

   When sending a Renew message in response to the receipt of a
   Reconfigure message, the client MUST include a Server Identifier
   option identifying the server the client most recently communicated
   with.


7.  Security Considerations

   This document allows the Rebind message type to appear in the
   Reconfigure Message option of a Reconfigure message so that the
   client rebinds to a different DHCPv6 server.  A malicious attacker
   may use a faked Reconfigure message to force the client to disconnect
   from the current server and relink to a faked server by quickly
   responding to the client's Rebind message.  These attacks may be
   prevented by using the AUTH option [RFC3315] or Secure DHCPv6
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-secure-dhcpv6].
