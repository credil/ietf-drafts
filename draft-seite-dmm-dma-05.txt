                     Distributed Mobility Anchoring
                       draft-seite-dmm-dma-05.txt

Abstract

   Most existing IP mobility solutions are derived from Mobile IP
   principles where a given mobility anchor maintains Mobile Nodes (MNs)
   binding up-to-date.  Data traffic is then encapsulated between the
   mobility anchor and the MN or its Access Router.  These approaches
   are usually implemented on a centralised architectures where both MN
   context and traffic encapsulation need to be processed at a central
   network entity, i.e. the mobility anchor.  However, one of the trend
   in mobile network evolution is to "flatten" mobility architecture by
   confining mobility support in the access network, e.g. at the access
   routers level, keeping the rest of the network unaware of the
   mobility events and their support.  This document discusses the
   deployment of a Proxy Mobile IP approach in such a flat architecture.
   The solution allows to dynamically distribute mobility functions
   among access routers for an optimal routing management.  The goal is
   also to dynamically adapt the mobility support of the MN's needs by
   applying traffic redirection only to MNs' flows when an IP handover
   occurs.

1.  Terminology

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 inherited terminology

      The following terms used in this document are to be interpreted as
      defined in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification [RFC5213]; Mobile
      Node (MN), home Network Prefix (HNP), Mobile Node Identifier (MN-
      Identifier), Proxy Binding Update (PBU), and Proxy Binding
      Acknowledgement (PBA).

   Mobility capable Access Router (MAR)

      The Mobility capable Access Router is an access router which
      provides mobility management functions.  It has both mobility
      anchoring and location update functional capabilities.  A Mobility
      capable Access Router can act as a Home or as a Visited Mobility
      capable Access Router (respectively H-MAR and V-MAR).  Any given
      MAR could act both as H-MAR and V-MAR for a given mobile node
      having different HNPs, either allocated by this MAR (H-MAR role)
      or another MAR on which the mobile node was previously attached
      (V-MAR role).

      *  H-MAR: it allocates HNP for mobile nodes.  Similarly to
         [RFC5213], the H-MAR is the topological anchor point for the
         mobile node's home network prefix(es) it has allocated.  The
         H-MAR acts as a regular IPv6 router for HNPs it has allocated,
         and when a mobile node has moved away and attached to a V-MAR,
         the H-MAR is responsible for: tracking the mobile node location
         (i.e. the V-MAR where the mobile node is currently attached),
         and forwarding packets to the V-MAR where the mobile node is
         attached.
      *  V-MAR: it manages the mobility-related signaling for a mobile
         node, using a HNP allocated by a MAR previously visited by the
         mobile node, that is attached to its access link.


2.  Introduction

   Most existing IP mobility solutions are derived from Mobile IP
   [RFC3775] principles where a given mobility agent (e.g. the Home
   Agent (HA) in Mobile IP or the Local Mobility Agent (LMA) in Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213]) maintains Mobile Nodes (MNs) bindings.  Data
   traffic is then encapsulated between the MN or its Access Router
   (e.g. the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) in PMIPv6) and its mobility
   agent.  In other words, these approaches rely on a centralised
   architecture where both MN mobility context and traffic encapsulation
   features need to be maintained at a central network entity, the
   mobility agent.  Such centralised approach provides the ability to

   route MN traffic whatever its localisation is, as well as to support
   handovers when it moves from access router to access router; however,
   when millions of MNs are communicating in a given cellular network,
   such a centralised network entity may cause bottlenecks and single
   point of failure issues, which requires costly network dimensioning
   and engineering to be fixed.  In addition, tunnelling encapsulations
   impact the global network efficiency since they require the
   maintenance of MN's specific contexts in each tunnel end nodes and
   they incur delays in packet processing and transport functions.
   Besides, centralized mobility management might not take into account
   current network evolution where the trend is to cache and distribute
   content (e.g.  CDN architecture) closer to the end-user.  As a
   consequence, alternative mobility approaches are currently being
   discussed and a potential solution is the distribution of mobility
   anchors, as stated by requirement "REQ1" in
   [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements].

   Moreover, it is well established that a huge amount of mobile
   communications are set up while the MN remains attached to the same
   access router.  For example, the user is being communicating at home,
   in his office, at a cafe, etc. and the mobility support is thus not
   required.  Applying the aforementioned centralised principles leads
   then to maintain user's mobility contexts, whereas the MN remains
   motionless.  So, to avoid such a waste of ressources, mobility
   management should come into play only when the mobile node changes
   the point of attachment (i.e. performs a handover) and when it needs
   the conservation of the current IP address.  Actually, this is the
   requirement "REQ2" from [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements].

   The DMM working group has been chartered to address above issues by
   exploring the distribution of mobility management functions and, for
   the sake of pragmatism, it has been agreed to firstly focus on
   existing mobility protocols.  The goal of this document is to address
   this concern and, thus, has no other ambition than to discuss the use
   of legacy IP mobility protocols in distributed anchoring
   architecture.  Besides, it must be noted this document aims only to
   meet basic [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements] requirements, namely:

   o  confining the mobility support at the access routers level,
      keeping the rest of the network unaware of mobility events and
      their support (REQ1);
   o  dynamically adapting mobility support to each of the MN's needs by
      applying traffic redirection only to MNs' flows that are already
      established when an IP handover occurs (REQ2).

3.  Basics of Distributed Mobility Management

3.1.  Fundamentals

   As stated in [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements], mobility anchoring may be
   distributed to multiple locations in the access network.  For
   example, mobility anchoring (MA) function could be co-located with
   the access router (AR) as shown on Figure 1.  This architecture
   allows the traffic to be anchored closer to the mobile node and, for
   example, to provide optimal mobility support to distributed content
   (e.g.  CDN based delivery architecture).

                 Figure 1: Distributed Mobility Management

   Mobility management may be partially distributed, i.e. only the data
   plane is distributed, or fully distributed, i.e. both the data plane
   and control plane are distributed [I-D.yokota-dmm-scenario].  If
   conceptual differences exist, these two approaches share common
   fundamentals and it is possible to describe the generic behavior of a
   DMM deployment.  Note that the following focuses only on the two
   first requirements of [I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements] (i.e. distribution
   of mobile anchoring and dynamic mobility management)

   In a standard IPv6 network without specific mobility support, any
   host is able to set up communications flows using a global IPv6
   address acquired with the support of its current access router
   [RFC4862].  When the host moves from this access router to a new one,
   its ongoing IP sessions cannot be maintained without leveraging on IP
   mobility mechanisms.  However, once attached to the new access
   router, the host can again acquire a routable global IPv6 address to
   be used for any new communication flow it sets up.  Hence, a flow
   based mobility support may be restricted to provide traffic
   indirection to host's flows that are already ongoing during host's
   handovers between access routers.  Any new flow being set up uses the
   new host's global address acquired on the new link available after
   the handover.

Internet-Draft       Distributed Mobility Anchoring            July 2012


   When a multiple-interface host moves between access routers of
   different access technologies, such a simple approach can also be
   applied, considering that each network interface provides dynamically
   global IPv6 addresses acquired on current access routers.

   Hence, any given IP flow can be considered as implicitly anchored on
   the current MN's access router when being set up.  Meaning that, if
   the MN moves across more than one access router and initiates IP
   communications while being attached to different access routers, the
   MN might be served simultaneously by more than one mobility anchor.
   While the MN is attached to its initial access router, the IP flow is
   delivered as for any standard IPv6 node.  The anchoring function at
   the access router is thus needed only to manage traffic indirection
   if the MN moves to a new access router and for subsequent movements
   while the IP flow remains active), maintaining the flow communication
   until it ends up.

   Any flow's incoming packet toward the MN is routed in a standard way
   to the access router anchoring the flow as the packet contains the
   destination IP address issued from router prefix.  Then, if the MN is
   currently attached to the initial anchor access router, the incoming
   packet is directly delivered over the access link.  Otherwise, the
   anchoring access router needs to redirect the packet to the current
   (or one of the currents) MN's access router(s).

   Any flow's outgoing packet from the MN is sent over either the
   initial anchor access router link or another access router link it is
   currently using.  In the first case, the packet can be routed in a
   standard way, i.e., without requiring networks mobility support
   functions.  In the second case, we consider its redirection to the
   initial flows' anchor router, but it may be noticed that direct
   routing by the current access router may be also allowed (yet this
   may lead to more stringent security and policy considerations).

3.2.  Considerations on Client based mobility management

   Actually, there is no issue to implement a basic DMM (as described in
   previous section) with vanilla Mobile IP protocol, e.g.  [RFC3775],
   as long as the MN can manage simultaneously different bindings to
   different Home Agents (HA), i.e. manage simultaneously more than one
   tunnel to the mobile anchors.  Basically, nothing prevent to
   implement the HA functionalities in the access routers, so that any
   given IP flow can be considered as implicitly anchored on the current
   host's access router when set up.  The anchoring function at the
   access router is acting only to manage traffic indirection while the
   host moves to a new access router.  When the MN moves to a new access
   router, the MN implicitly considers the previous access router as the
   HA for IP addresses allocated by this access router.  Then, the MN

Internet-Draft       Distributed Mobility Anchoring            July 2012


   can perform the binding update to the previous access router for IP
   session initiated on it.  So, MN's current traffic remains attached
   to the previous access router which is responsible for forwarding the
   IP flows to the MN.

   Figure 2 illustrates the use of Mobile IP in a distributed
   architecture.  For example, let's consider an IP flow, flow#1,
   initiated by the mobile node, MN, when attached to AR1.  Flow#1 is
   routed in a standard way as long as the MN remains attached to AR1.
   If the MN moves to AR2, the MN proceeds to the binding update to AR1,
   which plays the role of HA, so that flow#1 remains anchored to AR1.
   The home address is the IP address obtained from AR1 and the Care-of-
   Address is the IP address obtained from AR2.  If MN starts a new IP
   communication, flow#2, while attached to AR2; flow#2 is routed in a
   standard way as long as the MN remains attached to AR2.  In this
   situation, applications can use either the Home Address or the Care-
   of-Address and the IP stack is supposed to make the source address
   selection depending on the need for mobility support; in the example
   of Figure 2, the Home Address shall be used as the source address for
   flow#1 and the Care-of-Addresses for flow#2.  Then, if the MN moves
   to another access router, flow#1 and flow#2 will be respectively
   anchored to AR1/HA and AR2/HA.  Mobile IP resources (mobility context
   and tunneling in both ARx/HA and MN) are released after IP
   communcation stopped.

                Figure 2: Distributed Client Based Mobility

3.3.  Considerations on Network based mobility management

   It is also possible to go for DMM with Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213].
   For example, mobility functions, i.e.  MAG and LMA, can be co-located
   with the access routers.  The anchoring behavior might be similar to
   the client based solution; however there is an issue with the binding
   update management.  In a network based solution, the MN is not
   supposed to participate to mobility signaling and the MAG is expected
   to know the mobility anchor serving the MN.  This problem can be
   tricky in distributed mobility architecture because 1) the MN can be
   served by more than one LMA (see fundamentals in Section 3.1) and 2)
   the mobility anchor depends on point of attachment when the IP
   communication has been initiated.  There are basically two ways to
   address the issue without modifying proxy mobile IP:

   1.  Involve the MN in the mobility management process: during the
       attachment process to a new access router, the MN could
       communicate its ongoing mobility sessions (i.e. list of current
       HNP with associated mobility anchors) to the MAG.  For example,
       this information could be provided in a dedicated router
       solicitation option.
   2.  Rely on centralized part of the control plane: when the MN
       attaches to a new access router, the MAG function retrieves the
       mobility sessions, for that MN, from a centralized database.
       This database is expected to be updated each time a new prefix is
       allocated to the MN, and also when the prefix is released.

   Even if the first option does not introduce a new piece of protocol,
   it can be seen as a violation of the basic of the network based
   mobility approach where the MN must remain agnostic of the mobility
   support.  So, in the following, we will go for the second option.


4.  Solution Overview for network based DMM

4.1.  Distributed and Dynamic Mobility Anchoring

   The basic idea is to distribute mobility traffic management with
   dynamic user's traffic anchoring in access network nodes.  The
   solution relies on a very simple flat architecture outlined in
   Figure 3 where the Mobility capable Access Router (MAR) supports both
   traffic anchoring and MN's location management functionalities.  The

   architecture relies on a centralized database storing ongoing
   mobility sessions for the MNs (see Section 4.2 for details).  This
   database stores the HNPs currently allocated to the MN and their
   respective anchoring point.  This database could be an extension to
   the policy store used in [RFC5213]; however, the detailed
   specification of the interaction between MAGs and this database is
   currenly out of the scope of this document.

   Regular IPv6 routing applies when an IP communication is initiated.
   For instance, if the mobile node (e.g.  MN1), being attached to MAR1,
   initiates a communication with CN1: flow#1; the traffic will be
   routed through MAR1 without requiring any specific mobility
   operation.  When MN1 moves away from MAR1 and attaches to MAR2, the
   traffic remains anchored to MAR1 and is tunneled between MAR1 and
   MAR2.  MAR1 becomes the mobility anchor, for IP sessions initiated by
   MN1 when it was attached to MAR1, and MAR2 plays the role of MAG for
   these sessions.

   Communications newly initiated, e.g. flow#2, while the mobile node is
   attached to MAR2 will be routed in a standard way via MAR2.  But, if
   the mobile node moves away from MAR2 (e.g. attaches to MAR3), while
   maintaining both flow#1 and flow#2, two mobility anchors come into
   play: flow#1 and flow#2 will be respectively anchored in MAR1 and
   MAR2.

   Summarizing , it is proposed to dynamically locate mobility anchoring
   depending on where the flow is initially created.  Accordingly,

   communications are expected to be initiated without requiring
   mobility anchoring and tunneling.  Note that, even if a mobile node
   is moving across several MARs, the tunnel endpoints are always on the
   initial H-MAR and on the current V-MAR.  In the case the mobile node
   moves from MAR1 to MAR2 then to MAR3, a tunnel will be firstly
   established between MAR1 and MAR2; then the tunnel will be moved
   between MAR1 and MAR3.

   However such architecture leads to new requirement on the HNP prefix
   model.  Actually, because the HNP is anchored to its mobility anchor
   (i.e.  H-MAR), a dynamic mobility anchoring requires that each MAR
   must advertise different per-MN prefixes set.

     Figure 5: Handover management with Distributed Mobility Anchoring

   Following are the main steps of the handover management process:

   1.  The mobile node, MN1, attaches to MAR1 which is responsible for
       allocating the MN-HNP, e.g.  HNP1 for MN1.
   2.  Hence, the mobile node can initiate and maintain data transport
       sessions (with CN1 in the picture), using IP addresses derived
       from HNP1, in a standard way while it remains attached to MAR1,
       i.e. mobility functions do not come into play.
   3.  The MN attaches to MAR2 which will thus acts as V-MAR for HNP1.
       Fistly, MAR2 retrieves the ongoing MN's mobility sessions from
       the centralized sessions database; here only one mobility session
       is ongoing: (MN::HNP1,MAR1).  Then MAR2 proceeds to location
       update for HNP1 with MAR1, which plays the LMA role, i.e., PBU/
       PBA exchange between MAR2 and MAR1.  MAR2 also allocates new
       prefix (HNP2) for MN1; this prefix is meant to be used by
       application flows initiated after the handover.
   4.  In response to MN's router solicitation, MAR2 is expected to
       advertise both HNP1 and HNP2 to the MN, for respectively, the IP
       communications initiated when the MN was attached to MAR1 and the
       IP communications which will be initiated while attached to MAR2.
       An IP address derived from HNP1 must not be used for new IP
       communications; so, prefix HNP1 is announced as deprecated.  The
       MN could also make the prefix selection relying on prefix
       properties [I-D.korhonen-dmm-prefix-properties] if supported.
   5.  MAR1, playing the LMA role for HNP1, encapsulates MN1's traffic
       and tunnels it to the V-MAR, i.e.  MAR2, where packets are
       decapsulated and delivered to the MN.
   6.  The mobile node initiates and maintains new data transport
       sessions, e.g. with CN2, using IP addresses derived from HNP2.
       This traffic is routed in a standard way while the mobile node
       remains attached to MAR2.

4.3.  Multiple Interfaces support

   The distribution of mobility functions can also apply in the context
   of multiple-interfaces terminals.  In such a case, any given IP flow
   can be considered as implicitly anchored on the current host's access
   router when set up.  Until the host does not move from the initial
   access router (H-MAR), the IP flow is delivered as for any standard
   IPv6 node.  The anchoring function at the H-MAR is thus managing
   traffic indirection only if one, or several, IP flow(s) are moved to
   another interface, and for subsequent movements while the initial
   anchored flows remain active.  This anchoring is performed on a per-
   flow basis and each H-MAR needs to track all possible V-MARs for a
   given host on the move.  The H-MAR must also manage different tunnels
   for a given mobile node providing that the node is multihomed and it

   simultaneously processes different IP flows on its interfaces.

   Lets consider a simple example to illustrate the dynamic per-flow
   mobility anchoring.  Figure 6 depicts the IP flow mobility management
   for a mobile node with two interfaces.  The IP data flows, Flow#1 and
   Flow#2, have been initiated on if1.  Thus, Flow#1 and Flow#2, using
   respecively prefixes HNP1 and HNP2, are anchored to MAR1.  Referring
   to the picture, Flow#1 has not been moved; so Flow#1 is delivered in
   a standard IPv6 way.  Flow#2 has been transferred from If1 to If2, so
   Flow#2 packets, corresponding to HNP2, are tunneled from MAR1 to
   MAR2.  In other words, MAR1 and MAR2 are respectively the H-MAR
   anchor and the V-MAR for flow#2.
