The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard method for
transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.  PPP
defines an extensible Link Control Protocol (LCP) and proposes a
family of Network Control Protocols (NCP) for establishing and
configuring different network-layer protocols.

This document defines the NCP for establishing and configuring Remote
Bridging for PPP links.

This document obsoletes RFC 2878, which was based on the IEEE
802.1D-1993 MAC Bridge.  This document extends that specification
by improving support for bridge control packets.

This document is a product of the Point-to-Point Protocol Extensions
Working Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
