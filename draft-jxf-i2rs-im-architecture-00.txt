                 An information model atchitecture of network device
                   draft-jxf-i2rs-im-architecture-00

Abstract

   Currently, network equipment already has some Northbound Interfaces,
   such as SNMP, NETCONF, TL1; and some languages are also provided to
   describe the data model, such as MIB, SCHEMA and even YANG.  While
   till now, there is not a clear defined information model.  In NETCONF
   domain, some standards are being defined.  In order to reduce the
   cost of NMS integration in customer side, a clear defined information
   model is necessary, just like the SID in TMF.

1.  Introduction

   Currently, network equipment already has some Northbound Interfaces,
   such as SNMP, NETCONF, TL1; and some languages are also provided to
   describe the data model, such as MIB, SCHEMA and even YANG.  While
   till now, there is not a clear defined information model.  In NETCONF
   domain, some standards are being defined.  In order to reduce the
   cost of NMS integration in customer side, a clear defined information
   model is necessary, just like the SID in TMF.

   In order to understand the difference between information model and
   data model, please refer to the RFC3444.

Internet-Draft          NETWORK INFORMATION MODEL           October 2013


   This document will introduce a set of information models.  We hope
   this model could help the engineer define the model of network
   service described by SCHEMA or YANG.

2.  The overview of information model of network equipment

   This information model is very important.  All interfaces design and
   implementation will use this model, such as MIB, Schema and TL1, even
   RESTful API.

   The following figure illustrates the architecture of this information
   model:

   |       +---------------------------------------------------------------------
   | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------


2.1.  The infrastructure plane

   The infrastructure plane provides a minimum set of functions to
   support the running system, And this plane can be deployed
   independently, which will not be affected by upper layer.

   This plane also provides the API to operate the hardware and
   software, such as software installation, upgrade, and so on.

   It has no relation with IP associated service and can be applied to
   other embedded system device.

2.2.  The network service plane

   The network service plane provides the model definition of all
   network communication services, which can be divided into five
   layers: Service Layer, Protocol Layer, Resource Layer, Policy Layer
   and Container Layer.  Based on the interfaces provided by
   infrastructure plane, all network services can be distributed on some
   deployment units that can be main board, I/O board or one CPU of
   multiple CPUs system.

3.  The layer

3.1.  System Inventory Objects Layer

   L-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   | System Inventory Objects Layer
   |         M----------------+ M-------------+ M-------------+ M----------------+
   |         | Logical System | | Device Mgmt.| | File System | | Component Mgmt.|
   |         +----------------+ +-------------+ +-------------+ +----------------+
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


   The system inventory Layer provides the model definition to manage
   all hardware, logical device or virtual system, it include device
   management, file management, the system component management.

3.2.  The System Management Layer

   L-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   | System Management Layer
   |        M-------------+ M-------------------------+ M---------------------+
   |        | System Info | | Softwate Install&Update | | Sys Porcess Monitor |
   |        +-------------+ +-------------------------+ +---------------------+
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


   This layer provides the model of OS, like software installation,
   upgrade, like the monitor of system process.  The function of some
   basic MIB will be placed here, such as the system MIB of RFC1213.

3.3.  The network container layer

   |         | L3VPN | | L2VPN | | VLAN |
   |         +-------+ +-------+ +------+
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


   The container layer is defined to support some network level object
   and provides the key of network, or virtual network, and some top
   level attribute, such as ID, NAME, TYPE, and so on.

3.4.  The network policy layer

   L-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   | Network Policy Layer
   |         M-----+ M--------------+ M------------+
   |         | ACL | | Route Policy | | QoS Policy |
   |         +-----+ +--------------+ +------------+
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


   This layer defines the network security, Quality of Service, Route
   policy.

3.5.  The network resource layer

   L-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   | Network Resource Layer
   |         M-----------------+ M--------------+ M-----------------+ M------+
   |         | Interface Mgmt. | | Tunnle Mgmt. | | QoS Queue Mgmt. | | Topo |
   |         +-----------------+ +--------------+ +-----------------+ +------+
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


   The network resource layer manages the resource, such as interface,
   tunnel, and topology.

3.6.  The network protocol layer

   L-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   | Network Protocol Layer
   |         M------------------+ M-------------+ M-------------------------+
   |         | Routing Protocol | | L2 Protocol | | Management APP Protocol |

Internet-Draft          NETWORK INFORMATION MODEL           October 2013


   This layer includes the model of almost all functions supported by
   current network device, like the routing protocol, L2 protocol, MPLS
   and associated protocol, even all management protocol, like SNMP,
   Telnet.

3.7.  The network service layer

   L-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   | Network Service Layer
   |         M----------------------+ M--------------+ M-------------+
   |         | Built-in Service APP | | SLA TOOL APP | | OM TOOL APP |
   |         +----------------------+ +--------------+ +-------------+
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


   The network service layer includes the model of service or
   application level, like SLA tools application, this application face
   the requirement of the end user, not the network protocol.  Normally,
   this layer is not distributed in the network device, but sometimes,
   there are some built-in applications, like NQA.

   The module in this layer cannot depend each other and can only depend
   on the bottom layer.
