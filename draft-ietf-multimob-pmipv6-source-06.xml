    <abstract>
      <t>Multicast communication can be enabled in Proxy Mobile IPv6 domains
      via the Local Mobility Anchors by deploying MLD proxy functions at
      Mobile Access Gateways, via a direct traffic distribution within an
      ISP's access network, or by selective route optimization schemes. This
      document describes the support of mobile multicast senders in Proxy
      Mobile IPv6 domains for all three scenarios. Protocol optimizations for
      synchronizing PMIPv6 with PIM, as well as a peering function for MLD
      Proxies are defined. Mobile sources always remain agnostic of multicast
      mobility operations.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) <xref target="RFC5213"></xref> extends
      Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) <xref target="RFC6275"></xref> by network-based
      management functions that enable IP mobility for a host without
      requiring its participation in any mobility-related signaling.
      Additional network entities called the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA), and
      Mobile Access Gateways (MAGs), are responsible for managing IP mobility
      on behalf of the mobile node (MN). An MN connected to a PMIPv6 domain,
      which only operates according to the base specifications of <xref
      target="RFC5213"></xref>, cannot participate in multicast communication,
      as MAGs will discard group packets.</t>

      <t>Multicast support for mobile listeners can be enabled within a PMIPv6
      domain by deploying MLD proxy functions at Mobile Access Gateways, and
      multicast routing functions at Local Mobility Anchors <xref
      target="RFC6224"></xref>. This base deployment option is the simplest
      way to PMIPv6 multicast extensions in the sense that it follows the
      common PMIPv6 traffic model and neither requires new protocol operations
      nor additional infrastructure entities. Standard software functions need
      to be activated on PMIPv6 entities, only, at the price of possibly
      non-optimal multicast routing.</t>

      <t>Alternate solutions leverage performance optimization by providing
      multicast routing at the access gateways directly <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-multimob-fmipv6-pfmipv6-multicast"></xref>, or by
      selective route optimization schemes <xref target="RFC7028"></xref>.
      Such approaches (partially) follow the business model of providing
      multicast data services in parallel to PMIPv6 unicast routing <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-multimob-handover-optimization"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Multicast listener support satisfies the needs of receptive use cases
      such as IPTV or server-centric gaming on mobiles. However, current
      trends in the Internet develop towards user-centric, highly interactive
      group applications like user generated streaming, conferencing,
      collective mobile sensing, etc. Many of these popular applications
      create group content at end systems and can largely profit from a direct
      data transmission to a multicast-enabled network.</t>

      <t>This document describes the support of mobile multicast senders in
      Proxy Mobile IPv6 domains subsequently for the base deployment scenario
      <xref target="RFC6224"></xref>, for direct traffic distribution within
      an ISP's access network, as well as for selective route optimization
      schemes. The contribution of this work reflects the source mobility
      problem as discussed in <xref target="RFC5757"></xref>. Mobile Nodes in
      this setting remain agnostic of multicast mobility operations.</t>

        <t>An MN in a PMIPv6 domain will decide on multicast data transmission
        completely independent of its current mobility conditions. It will
        send packets as initiated by applications, using its source address
        with Home Network Prefix (HNP) and a multicast destination address
        chosen by application needs. Multicast packets will arrive at the
        currently active MAG via one of its downstream local (wireless) links.
        A multicast unaware MAG would simply discard these packets in the
        absence of instructions for packet processing, i.e., a multicast
        routing information base (MRIB).</t>

        <t>An MN can successfully distribute multicast data in PMIPv6, if MLD
        proxy functions are deployed at the MAG as described in <xref
        target="RFC6224"></xref>. In this set-up, the MLD proxy instance
        serving a mobile multicast source has configured its upstream
        interface at the tunnel towards MN's corresponding LMA. For each LMA,
        there will be a separate instance of an MLD proxy.</t>

        <t>According to the specifications given in <xref
        target="RFC4605"></xref>, multicast data arriving from a downstream
        interface of an MLD proxy will be forwarded to the upstream interface
        and to all but the incoming downstream interfaces that have
        appropriate forwarding states for this group. Thus multicast streams
        originating from an MN will arrive at the corresponding LMA and
        directly at all mobile receivers co-located at the same MAG and MLD
        proxy instance. Serving as the designated multicast router or an
        additional MLD proxy, the LMA forwards data to the fixed Internet,
        whenever forwarding states are maintained by multicast routing. If the
        LMA is acting as another MLD proxy, it will forward the multicast data
        to its upstream interface, and to downstream interfaces with matching
        subscriptions, accordingly.</t>

        <t>In case of a handover, the MN (being unaware of IP mobility) can
        continue to send multicast packets as soon as network connectivity is
        re-established. At this time, the MAG has determined the corresponding
        LMA, and IPv6 unicast address configuration (including PMIPv6
        bindings) has been completed. Still multicast packets arriving at the
        MAG are discarded (if not buffered) until the MAG has completed the
        following steps.</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>The MAG has determined that the MN is admissible to multicast
            services.</t>

            <t>The MAG has added the new downstream link to the MLD proxy
            instance with up-link to the corresponding LMA.</t>
          </list>As soon as the MN's uplink is associated with the
        corresponding MLD proxy instance, multicast packets are forwarded
        again to the LMA and eventually to receivers within the PMIP domain
        (see the call flow in <xref target="fig-callflow"></xref>). In this
        way, multicast source mobility is transparently enabled in PMIPv6
        domains that deploy the base scenario for multicast.</t>

        <t>These multicast deployment considerations likewise apply for mobile
        nodes that operate with their IPv4 stack enabled in a PMIPv6 domain.
        PMIPv6 can provide IPv4 home address mobility support <xref
        target="RFC5844"></xref>. IPv4 multicast is handled by an IGMP proxy
        function at the MAG in an analogous way.</t>

        <t>Following these deployment steps, multicast traffic distribution
        transparently inter-operates with PMIPv6. It is worth noting that an
        MN - while being attached to the same MAG as the mobile source, but
        associated with a different LMA - cannot receive multicast traffic on
        a shortest path. Instead, multicast streams flow up to the LMA of the
        mobile source, are transferred to the LMA of the mobile listener and
        tunneled downwards to the MAG again (see <xref
        target="Extensions"></xref> for further optimizations).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Base Solution for Source Mobility: Details">
        <t>A support of multicast source mobility in PMIPv6 requires to deploy
        general multicast functions at PMIPv6 routers and to define their
        interaction with the PMIPv6 protocol in the following way.</t>

        <section title="Operations of the Mobile Node">
          <t>A Mobile Node willing to send multicast data will proceed as if
          attached to the fixed Internet. No specific mobility or other
          multicast related functionalities are required at the MN.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Operations of the Mobile Access Gateway">
          <t>A Mobile Access Gateway is required to have MLD proxy instances
          deployed, one for each tunnel to an LMA, which serves as its unique
          upstream link (cf., <xref target="RFC6224"></xref>). On the arrival
          of an MN, the MAG decides on the mapping of downstream links to a
          proxy instance and the upstream link to the LMA based on the regular
          Binding Update List as maintained by PMIPv6 standard operations.
          When multicast data is received from the MN, the MAG MUST identify
          the corresponding proxy instance from the incoming interface and
          forwards multicast data upstream according to <xref
          target="RFC4605"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The MAG MAY apply special admission control to enable multicast
          data transition from an MN. It is advisable to take special care
          that MLD proxy implementations do not redistribute multicast data to
          downstream interfaces without appropriate subscriptions in
          place.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Operations of the Local Mobility Anchor">
          <t>For any MN, the Local Mobility Anchor acts as the persistent Home
          Agent and at the same time as the default multicast upstream for the
          corresponding MAG. It will manage and maintain a multicast
          forwarding information base for all group traffic arriving from its
          mobile sources. It SHOULD participate in multicast routing functions
          that enable traffic redistribution to all adjacent LMAs within the
          PMIPv6 domain and thereby ensure a continuous receptivity while the
          source is in motion.</t>

          <section anchor="PIM-Source"
                   title="Local Mobility Anchors Operating PIM">
            <t>Local Mobility Anchors that operate the PIM-SM routing protocol
            <xref target="RFC4601"></xref> will require sources to be directly
            connected for sending PIM registers to the RP. This does not hold
            in a PMIPv6 domain, as MAGs are routers intermediate to MN and the
            LMA. In this sense, MNs are multicast sources external to the
            PIM-SM domain.</t>

            <t>To mitigate this incompatibility common to all subsidiary MLD
            proxy domains, the LMA MUST act as a PIM Border Router and
            activate the Border-bit. In this case, the DirectlyConnected(S) is
            treated as being TRUE for mobile sources and the PIM-SM forwarding
            rule "iif == RPF_interface(S)" is relaxed to be TRUE, as the
            incoming tunnel interface from MAG to LMA is considered as not
            part of the PIM-SM component of the LMA (see A.1 of <xref
            target="RFC4601"></xref> ).</t>

            <t>In addition, an LMA serving as PIM Designated Router (DR) is
            connected to MLD proxies via individual IP-tunnel interfaces and
            will experience changing PIM source states on handover. As the
            incoming interface connects to a point-to-point link, PIM Assert
            contention is not active, and incoming interface validation is
            only performed by RPF (Reverse Path Forwarding) checks.
            Consequently, a PIM DR SHOULD update incoming source states, as
            soon as RPF inspection succeeds, i.e., after PMIPv6 forwarding
            state update. Consequently, PIM routers SHOULD be able to manage
            these state changes, but some implementations are expected to
            incorrectly refuse packets until the previous state has timed
            out.</t>

            <t>Notably, running BIDIR PIM <xref target="RFC5015"></xref> on
            LMAs remains robust with respect to source location and does not
            require special configurations or state management for
            sources.</t>

        <section title="IPv4 Support">
          <t>An MN in a PMIPv6 domain may use an IPv4 address transparently
          for communication as specified in <xref target="RFC5844"></xref>.
          For this purpose, an LMA can register an IPv4-Proxy-CoA in its
          Binding Cache and the MAG can provide IPv4 support in its access
          network. Correspondingly, multicast membership management will be
          performed by the MN using IGMP. For multicast support on the network
          side, an IGMP proxy function needs to be deployed at MAGs in exactly
          the same way as for IPv6. <xref target="RFC4605"></xref> defines
          IGMP proxy behaviour in full agreement with IPv6/MLD. Thus IPv4
          support can be transparently provided following the obvious
          deployment analogy.</t>

          <t>For a dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 access network, the MAG proxy
          instances SHOULD choose multicast signaling according to address
          configurations on the link, but MAY submit IGMP and MLD queries in
          parallel, if needed. It should further be noted that the
          infrastructure cannot identify two data streams as identical when
          distributed via an IPv4 and IPv6 multicast group. Thus duplicate
          data may be forwarded on a heterogeneous network layer.</t>

          <t>A particular note is worth giving the scenario of <xref
          target="RFC5845"></xref> in which overlapping private address spaces
          of different operators can be hosted in a PMIP domain by using GRE
          encapsulation with key identification. This scenario implies that
          unicast communication in the MAG-LMA tunnel can be individually
          identified per MN by the GRE keys. This scenario still does not
          impose any special treatment of multicast communication for the
          following reasons.</t>

          <t>Multicast streams from and to MNs arrive at a MAG on
          point-to-point links (identical to unicast). Multicast data
          transmission from the MAG to the corresponding LMA is link-local
          between the routers and routing/forwarding remains independent of
          any individual MN. So the MAG-proxy and the LMA SHOULD NOT use GRE
          key identifiers, but plain GRE encapsulation in multicast
          communication (including MLD queries and reports). Multicast traffic
          is transmitted as router-to-router forwarding via the MAG-to-LMA
          tunnels and according to the multicast routing information base
          (MRIB) of the MAG or the LMA. It remains independent of MN's unicast
          addresses, while the MAG proxy instance redistributes multicast data
          down the point-to-point links (interfaces) according to its local
          subscription states, independent of IP addresses of the MN.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Efficiency of the Distribution System">
          <t>The distribution system of the base solution directly follows
          PMIPv6 routing rules, and organizes multicast domains with respect
          to LMAs. Thus, no coordination between address spaces or services is
          required between the different instances, provided their associated
          LMAs belong to disjoint multicast domains. Routing is optimal for
          communication between MNs of the same domain, or stationary
          subscribers.</t>

          <t>In the following, efficiency-related issues remain.</t>

 (a) Multicast Access at Proxy Uplink      (b) Multicast Routing at MAG
      ]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t><xref target="fig2"></xref> displays the corresponding deployment
        scenarios, which separate multicast from PMIPv6 unicast routing. It is
        assumed throughout these scenarios that all MAGs (MLD proxies) are
        linked to a single multicast routing domain. Notably, this scenario
        requires coordination of multicast address utilization and service
        bindings.</t>

        <t>Multicast traffic distribution can be simplified in these
        scenarios. A single proxy instance at MAGs with up-link into the
        multicast domain will serve as a first hop multicast gateway and avoid
        traffic duplication or detour routing. Multicast routing functions at
        MAGs will seamlessly embed access gateways within a multicast cloud.
        However, mobility of the multicast source in this scenario will
        require some multicast routing protocols to rebuild distribution
        trees. This can cause significant service disruptions or delays (see
        <xref target="RFC5757"></xref> for further aspects). Deployment
        details are specific to the multicast routing protocol in use, in the
        following described for common protocols.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="MLD Proxies at MAGs">
        <t>In a PMIPv6 domain, single MLD proxy instances can be deployed at
        each MAG that enable multicast service at the access via an uplink to
        a multicast service infrastructure (see <xref target="fig2"></xref>
        (a) ). To avoid service disruptions on handovers, the uplinks of all
        proxies SHOULD be adjacent to the same next-hop multicast router. This
        can either be achieved by arranging proxies within a flat access
        network, or by upstream tunnels that terminate at a common multicast
        router.</t>

        <t>Multicast data submitted by a mobile source will reach the MLD
        proxy at the MAG that subsequently forwards flows to the upstream, and
        all downstream interfaces with appropriate subscriptions. Traversing
        the upstream will transfer traffic into the multicast infrastructure
        (e.g., to a PIM Designated Router) which will route packets to all
        local MAGs that have joined the group, as well as further upstream
        according to protocol procedures and forwarding states.</t>

        <t>On handover, a mobile source will reattach to a new MAG and can
        continue to send multicast packets as soon as PMIPv6 unicast
        configurations have been completed. Like at the previous MAG, the new
        MLD proxy will forward data upstream and downstream to subscribers.
        Listeners local to the previous MAG will continue to receive group
        traffic via the local multicast distribution infrastructure following
        aggregated listener reports of the previous proxy. In general, traffic
        from the mobile source continues to be transmitted via the same
        next-hop multicast router using the same source address and thus
        remains unchanged when seen from the wider multicast
        infrastructure.</t>

        <section title="Considerations for PIM-SM on the Upstream">
          <t>A mobile source that transmits data via an MLD proxy will not be
          directly connected to a PIM Designated Router as discussed in <xref
          target="PIM-Source"></xref>. Countermeasures apply
          correspondingly.</t>

          <t>A PIM Designated Router that is connected to MLD proxies via
          individual IP-tunnel interfaces will experience invalid PIM source
          states on handover. In some implementations of PIM-SM this could
          lead to an interim packet loss (see Section <xref
          target="PIM-Source"></xref>). This problem can be mitigated by
          aggregating proxies on a lower layer.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="SSM Considerations">
          <t>Source-specific subscriptions invalidate with routes, whenever
          the source moves from or to the MAG/proxy of a subscriber. Multicast
          forwarding states will rebuild with unicast route changes. However,
          this may lead to noticeable service disruptions for locally
          subscribed nodes.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section anchor="PIM-SM" title="PIM-SM at MAGs">
        <t>The full-featured multicast routing protocol PIM-SM MAY be deployed
        in the access network for providing multicast services in parallel to
        unicast routes (see <xref target="fig2"></xref> b). Throughout this
        section, it is assumed that the PMIPv6 mobility domain is part of a
        single PIM-SM multicast routing domain with PIM-SM routing functions
        present at all MAGs and all LMAs. The PIM routing instance at a MAG
        SHALL then serve as the Designated Router (DR) for all directly
        attached Mobile Nodes. For expediting handover operations, it is
        advisable to position PIM Rendezvous Points (RPs) in the core of the
        PMIPv6 network domain. However, regular IP routing tables need not be
        present in a PMIPv6 deployment, and additional effort is required to
        establish reverse path forwarding rules as required by PIM-SM.</t>

        <section anchor="PIM-MRIB" title="Routing Information Base for PIM-SM">
          <t>In this scenario, PIM-SM will rely on a Multicast Routing
          Information Base (MRIB) that is generated independently of the
          policy-based routing rules of PMIPv6. The granularity of
          mobility-related routing locators required in PIM depends on the
          complexity (phases) of its deployment.</t>

          <t>The following information is needed for all three phases of PIM

              mobile members of the PMIPv6 domain MUST be defined consistently

              The setup of these general routes is expected to follow the
              topology of the operator network and is beyond the scope of this
              document.</t>

        </section>

        <section anchor="PIM-One" title="Operations of PIM in Phase One">
          <t>A new mobile source S will transmit multicast data of group G
          towards its MAG of attachment. Acting as a PIM DR, the access
          gateway will unicast-encapsulate the multicast packets and forward
          the data to the Virtual Interface (VI) with encapsulation target
          RP(G), a process known as PIM source registering. The RP will
          decapsulate and natively forward the packets down the RP-based
          distribution tree towards (mobile and stationary) subscribers.</t>

          <t>On handover, the point-to-point link connecting the mobile source
          to the old MAG will go down and all (S,*) flows terminate. In
          response, the previous DR (MAG) deactivates the data encapsulation
          channels for the transient source (i.e., all
          DownstreamJPState(S,*,VI) are set to NoInfo state). After
          reattaching and completing unicast handover negotiations, the mobile
          source can continue to transmit multicast packets, while being
          treated as a new source at its new DR (MAG). Source register
          encapsulation will be immediately initiated, and (S,G) data continue
          to flow natively down the (*,G) RP-based tree.</t>

          <t>Source handover management in PIM phase one admits low complexity
          and remains transparent to receivers. In addition, the source
          register tunnel management of PIM is a fast protocol operation and
          little overhead &iacute;s induced thereof. In a PMIPv6 deployment,
          PIM RPs MAY be configured to not initiated (S,G) shortest path trees
          for mobile sources, and thus remain in phase one of the protocol.
          The price to pay for such simplified deployment lies in possible
          routing detours by an overall RP-based packet distribution.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="PIM-Two" title="Operations of PIM in Phase Two">
          <t>After receiving source register packets, a PIM RP eventually will
          initiate a source-specific Join for creating a shortest path tree to
          the (mobile) source S, and issue a source register stop at the
          native arrival of data from S. For initiating an (S,G) tree, the RP,
          as well as all intermediate routers, require route entries for the
          HNP of the MN that - unless the RP coincides with the MAG of S -
          point towards the corresponding LMA of S. Consequently, the (S,G)
          tree will proceed from the RP via the (stable) LMA, down the LMA-MAG
          tunnel to the mobile source. This tree can be of lower routing
          efficiency than the PIM source register tunnel established in phase
          one.</t>

          <t>On handover, the mobile source reattaches to a new MAG (DR), and
          PMIPv6 unicast management will transfer the LMA-MAG tunnel to the
          new point of attachment. However, in the absence of a corresponding
          multicast forwarding state, the new DR will treat S as a new source
          and initiate a source registering of PIM phase one with the RP. In
          response, the PIM RP will recognize the known source at a new
          (tunnel) interface and immediately responds with a register stop. As
          the RP had previously joined the shortest path tree towards the
          source via the LMA, it will see an RPF change when data arrives at a
          new interface. Implementation-dependent, this can trigger an update
          of the PIM MRIB and trigger a new PIM Join message that will install
          the multicast forwarding state missing at the new MAG. Otherwise,
          the tree is periodically updated by Joins transmitted towards the
          new MAG on a path via the LMA. In proceeding this way, a quick
          recovery of PIM transition from phase one to two will be performed
          per handover.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="PIM-Three" title="Operations of PIM in Phase Three">
          <t>In response to an exceeded threshold of packet transmission, DRs
          of receivers eventually will initiate a source-specific Join for
          creating a shortest path tree to the (mobile) source S, thereby
          transitioning PIM into the final short-cut phase three. For all
          receivers not sharing a MAG with S, this (S,G) tree will range from
          the receiving DR via the (stable) LMA, the LMA-MAG tunnel, and the
          serving MAG to the mobile source. This tree is of higher routing
          efficiency than that established in the previous phase two, but need
          not outperform the PIM source register tunnel established in phase
          one. It provides the advantage of immediate data delivery to
          receivers that share a MAG with S.</t>

          <t>On handover, the mobile source reattaches to a new MAG (DR), and
          PMIPv6 unicast management will transfer the LMA-MAG tunnel to the
          new point of attachment. However, in the absence of a corresponding
          multicast forwarding state, the new DR will treat S as a new source
          and initiate a source registering of PIM phase one. A PIM
          implementation compliant with this change can recover phase three
          states in the following way. First, the RP recovers to phase two as
          described in the previous section, and will not forward data
          arriving via the source register tunnel. Tree maintenance eventually
          triggered by the RPF change (see <xref target="PIM-Two"></xref>)
          will generate proper states for a native forwarding from the new MAG
          via the LMA. Thereafter, packets arriving at the LMA without source
          register encapsulation are forwarded natively along the shortest
          path tree towards receivers.</t>

          <t>In consequence, the PIM transitions from phase one to two and to
          three will be quickly recovered per handover, but still lead to an
          enhanced signaling load and intermediate packet loss.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="PIM-SSM Considerations">
          <t>Source-specific Joins of receivers will guide PIM to operate in
          SSM mode and lead to an immediate establishment of source-specific
          shortest path trees. Such (S,G) trees will equal the distribution
          system of PIM's final phase three (see <xref
          target="PIM-Three"></xref>). However, on handover and in the absence
          of RP-based data distribution, SSM data delivery cannot be resumed
          via source registering as in PIM phase one. Consequently, data
          packets transmitted after a handover will be discarded at the MAG
          until regular tree maintenance has reestablished the (S,G)
          forwarding state at the new MAG.</t>

        <section title="Handover Optimizations for PIM">
          <t>Source-specific shortest path trees are constructed in PIM-SM
          (phase two and three), and in PIM-SSM that follow LMA-MAG tunnels
          towards a source. As PIM remains unaware of source mobility
          management, these trees invalidate under handovers with each tunnel
          re-establishment at a new MAG. Regular tree maintenance of PIM will
          recover the states, but remains unsynchronized and too slow to
          seamlessly preserve PIM data distribution services.</t>

          <t>A method to quickly recover PIM (S,G) trees under handover SHOULD
          synchronize multicast state maintenance with unicast handover
          operations and can proceed as follows. On handover, an LMA reads all
          (S,G) Join states from its corresponding tunnel interface and
          identifies those source addresses S_i that match moving HNPs. After
          re-establishing the new tunnel, it SHOULD associate the (S_i,*) Join
          states with the new tunnel endpoint and immediately trigger a state
          maintenance (PIM Join) message. In proceeding this way, the
          source-specific PIM states are transferred to the new tunnel end
          point and propagated to the new MAG in synchrony with unicast
          handover procedures.</t>

        single BIDIR-PIM multicast routing domain with BIDIR-PIM routing
        functions present at all MAGs and all LMAs. The PIM routing instance
        at a MAG SHALL then serve as the Designated Forwarder (DF) for all
        directly attached Mobile Nodes. For expediting handover operations, it
        is advisable to position BIDIR-PIM Rendezvous Point Addresses (RPAs)
        in the core of the PMIPv6 network domain. As regular IP routing tables
        need not be present in a PMIPv6 deployment, reverse path forwarding

          require protocol signaling nor additional reconfiguration delays to
          adapt to source mobility and can be considered the protocol of
          choice for mobile multicast operations in the access. As multicast

             title="MLD Proxy Peering Function for Optimized Source Mobility in PMIPv6">
      <t>A deployment of MLD Proxies (see <xref target="RFC4605"></xref>) at
      MAGs has proven a useful and appropriate approach to multicast in
      PMIPv6, see <xref target="RFC6224"></xref>, <xref
      target="RFC7028"></xref>. However, deploying unmodified standard proxies
      can go along with significant performance degradation for mobile senders
      as discussed along the lines of this document. To overcome these
      deficits, an optimized approach to multicast source mobility based on
      extended peering functions among proxies is defined in this section.
      Based on such direct data exchange between proxy instances at MAGs,
      triangular routing is avoided and multicast streams can be disseminated
      directly within a PMIPv6 access network, and in particular within MAG
      routing machines. Prior to presenting the solution, we will summarize
      the relevant requirements.</t>

          </list>Following local filter techniques, these requirements are met
        in the following solution.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Overview">
        <t>A peering interface for MLD proxies allows for a direct data
        exchange of locally attached multicast sources. Such peering
        interfaces can be configured - as a direct link or a bidirectional
        tunnel - between any two proxy instances (locally deployed as in <xref
        target="RFC6224"></xref> or remotely). Peerings remain as silent
        virtual links in regular proxy operations. Data is exchanged on such
        links only in cases, where one peering proxy directly connects on the
        downstream to a source of multicast traffic, which the other peering
        proxy actively subscribes to. In such cases, the source-connected
        proxy will receive a listener report on its peering interface and
        forwards traffic from its local source accordingly. It is worth noting
        that multicast traffic distribution on peering links does not follow
        reverse unicast paths to sources. In the following, operations are
        defined for ASM and SSM, but provide superior performance in the
        presence of source-specific signaling (IGMPv3/MLDv2) <xref
        target="RFC4604"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Operations at the Multicast Sender">
        <t>An MLD proxy in the perspective of a sender will see peering
        interfaces as restricted downstream interfaces. It will install and
        maintain source filters at its peering links that will restrict data
        transmission to those packets that originate from a source that is
        locally attached at one of its downstream interfaces.</t>

        <t>In detail, a proxy will extract from its configuration the network
        prefixes attached to its downstream interfaces and MUST implement a
        source filter base at its peering interfaces that restricts data
        transmission to IP source addresses from its local prefixes. This
        filter base MUST be updated, if and only if the downstream
        configuration changes. Multicast packets that arrive from the upstream
        interface of the proxy are thus prevented from traversing any peering
        link, but are only forwarded to regular downstream interfaces with
        appropriate subscription states. In this way, a multihop forwarding on
        peering links is prevented.</t>

        <t>Multicast traffic arriving from a locally attached source will be
        forwarded to the regular upstream interface and all downstreams with
        appropriate subscription states (i.e., regular proxy operations). In
        addition, multicast packets of local origin are transferred to those
        peering interfaces with appropriate subscription states.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Operations at the Multicast Listener">
        <t>From the listener side, peering interfaces appear as preferred
        upstream links. The multicast proxy will attempt to subscribe to
        multicast services on peering links for as many groups (channels) as
        possible. The general upstream interface configured according to <xref
        target="RFC4605"></xref> will be used only for those groups (channels)
        that remain unavailable from peerings. From this extension of <xref
        target="RFC4605"></xref>, an MLD proxy with peering interconnects will
        exhibit several interfaces for pulling remote traffic: the regular
        upstream and the peerings. Traffic available from any of the peering
        links will be mutually disjoint, but normally also available from the
        upstream. To prevent duplicate traffic from arriving at the listener
        side, the proxy <list style="symbols">
            <t>MAY delay aggregated reports to the upstream, and</t>

            <t>MUST apply appropriate filters to exclude duplicate
            streams.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>In detail, an MLD proxy instance at a MAG first issues listener
        reports (in parallel) to its peering links. These links only span one
        (virtual) hop. Whenever certain group traffic (SSM channels) does not
        arrive from the peerings after a waiting time (default: 10 ms),
        additional (complementary, in the case of SSM) reports are sent to the
        standard upstream interface.</t>

        <t>After the arrival of traffic from peering links, an MLD proxy MUST
        install source filters at its RFC 4605 upstream in the following
        way.</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="ASM with IGMPv2/MLDv1">In the presence of Any Source
            Multicast using IGMPv2/MLDv1, only, the proxy cannot signal source
            filtering to its upstream. Correspondingly, it applies (S,*)
            ingress filters at its upstream interface for all sources S seen
            in traffic on the peering links. It is noteworthy that unwanted
            traffic is still replicated to the proxy via the (wired) provider
            backbone, but not forwarded into the wireless access network.</t>

            <t hangText="ASM with IGMPv3/MLDv2">In the presence of
            source-specific signaling (IGMPv3/MLDv2), the upstream interface
            is set to (S,*) exclude mode for all sources S seen in traffic of
            the peering links. The corresponding source-specific signaling
            will prevent forwarding of duplicate traffic throughout the access
            network.</t>

            <t hangText="SSM">In the presence of Source Specific Multicast,
            the proxy will subscribe on its uplink interface to those (S,G)
            channels, only, that do not arrive via the peering links.</t>
          </list>In proceeding this way, multicast group data will arrive from
        peering interfaces first, while only peer-wise unavailable traffic is
        retrieved from the regular upstream interface.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document defines multicast sender mobility based on PMIPv6 and
      common multicast routing protocols. Consequently, threats identified as
      security concerns of <xref target="RFC3810"></xref>, <xref
      target="RFC4605"></xref>, <xref target="RFC5213"></xref>, and <xref
      target="RFC5844"></xref> are inherited by this document.</t>

      <t>In addition, particular attention should be paid to implications of
      combining multicast and mobility management at network entities. As this
      specification allows mobile nodes to initiate the creation of multicast
      forwarding states at MAGs and LMAs while changing attachments, threats
      of resource exhaustion at PMIP routers and access networks arrive from
      rapid state changes, as well as from high volume data streams routed
      into access networks of limited capacities. In cases of PIM-SM
      deployment, handover operations of the MNs include re-registering
      sources at the Rendezvous Points at possibly high frequency. In addition
      to proper authorization checks of MNs, rate controls at routing agents
      and replicators MAY be required to protect the agents and the downstream
      networks. In particular, MLD proxy implementations at MAGs SHOULD
      carefully procure for automatic multicast state extinction on the
      departure of MNs, as mobile multicast listeners in the PMIPv6 domain
      will in general not actively terminate group membership prior to
      departure.</t>

      <t>The deployment of IGMP/MLD proxies for multicast routing requires
      particular care, as routing loops on the upstream are not automatically
      detected. Peering functions between proxies extend this threat in the
      following way. Routing loops among peering and upstream interfaces are
      prevented by filters on local sources. Such filtering can fail, whenever
      prefix configurations for downstream interfaces at a proxy are incorrect
      or inconsistent. Consequently, implementations of peering-enabled
      proxies SHOULD take particular care on maintaining (varying) IP
      configurations at the downstream in a reliable and timely manner (see
      <xref target="RFC6224"></xref> for requirements on PMIPv6-compliant
      implementations of MLD proxies).</t>

    <section anchor="A-moup" title="Multiple Upstream Interface Proxy">
      <t>In this section, we document upstream extensions for an MLD proxy
      that were originally developed during the work on this document.
      Multiple proxy instances deployed at a single MAG (see <xref
      target="Base"></xref>) can be avoided by adding multiple upstream
      interfaces to a single MLD Proxy. In a typical PMIPv6 deployment, each
      upstream of a single proxy instance can interconnect to one of the LMAs.
      With such ambiguous upstream options, appropriate forwarding rules MUST
      be supplied to</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">

          mobile sources, and</t>

          <t>lead listener reports to initiating unique traffic
          subscriptions.</t>
        </list>This can be achieved by a complete set of source- and
      group-specific filter rules (e.g., (S,*), (*,G)) installed at proxy
      interfaces. These filters MAY be derived in parts from PMIPv6 routing
      policies, and can include a default behavior (e.g., (*,*)).</t>

      <section title="Operations for Local Multicast Sources">
        <t>Packets from a locally attached multicast source will be forwarded
        to all downstream interfaces with appropriate subscriptions, as well
        as up the interface with the matching source-specific filter.</t>

        <t>Typically, the upstream interface for a mobile multicast source is
        chosen based on the policy routing (e.g., the MAG-LMA tunnel interface
        for LMA-based routing or the interface towards the multicast router
        for direct routing), but alternate configurations MAY be applied.
        Packets from a locally attached multicast source will be forwarded to
        the corresponding upstream interface with the matching source-specific
        filter, as well as all the downstream interfaces with appropriate
        subscriptions.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Operations for Local Multicast Subscribers">
        <t>Multicast listener reports are group-wise aggregated by the MLD
        proxy. The aggregated report is issued to the upstream interface with
        matching group/channel-specific filter. The choice of the
        corresponding upstream interface for aggregated group membership
        reports MAY be additionally based on some administrative scoping rules
        for scoped multicast group addresses.</t>

        <t>In detail, a Multiple Upstream Interface proxy will provide and
        maintain a Multicast Subscription Filter Table that maps source- and
        group-specific filters to upstream interfaces. The forwarding decision
        for an aggregated MLD listener report is based on the first matching
        entry from this table, with the understanding that for IGMPv3/MLDv2
        the MLD proxy performs a state decomposition, if needed (i.e., a (*,G)
        subscription is split into (S,G) and (* \ S,G) in the presence of
        (*,G) after (S,G) interface entries), and that (S,*)-filters are
        always false in the absence of source-specific signaling, i.e. in
        IGMPv2/MLDv1 only domains.</t>

        <t>In typical deployment scenarios, specific group services (channels)
        could be either associated with selected uplinks to remote LMAs, while
        a (*,*) default subscription entry (in the last table line) is bound
        to a local routing interface, or selected groups are configured as
        local services first, while a (*,*) default entry (in the last table
        line) points to a remote uplink that provides the general multicast
        support.</t>
