The popularity of gateways that interwork between the PSTN (Public
Switched Telephone Network) and SIP networks has motivated the
publication of a set of common practices that can assure consistent
behavior across implementations.  This document taxonomizes the uses
of PSTN-SIP gateways, provides uses cases, and identifies mechanisms
necessary for interworking.  The mechanisms detail how SIP provides
for both 'encapsulation' (bridging the PSTN signaling across a SIP
network) and 'translation' (gatewaying).

This document is a product of the Session Initiation Proposal
Investigation Working Group of the IETF.

This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the
