This document describes the General Switch Management Protocol Version
3 (GSMPv3).  The GSMPv3 is an asymmetric protocol that allows one or
more external switch controllers to establish and maintain the state
of a label switch such as, an ATM, frame relay or MPLS
switch.  The GSMPv3 allows control of both unicast and multicast
switch connection state as well as control of switch system resources
and QoS features.

Working Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.
