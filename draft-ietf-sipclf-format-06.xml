    <workgroup>SIPCLF</workgroup>

    <abstract>
      <t>The SIPCLF Workgroup has defined a common log format framework for
      Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) servers. This common log format mimics
      the successful event logging format found in well-known web
      servers like Apache and web proxies like Squid. This document proposes
      an indexed text encoding format for the SIP Common Log Format (CLF) that
      retains the key advantages of a text-based format, while significantly
      increasing processing performance over a purely text-based
      implementation. This file format adheres to the SIP CLF data model and
      provides an effective encoding scheme for all mandatory and optional
      fields that appear in a SIP CLF record.</t>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>The extensive list of benefits and the widespread adoption of the
      Apache Common Log Format (CLF) has prompted the development of an
      analogous event logging mechanism for the Session
      Initiation Protocol <xref target="RFC3261"></xref> (SIP). Implementing a
      logging scheme for SIP is a considerable challenge. This is due in part
      to the fact that the behavior of a SIP entity is more complex as
      compared to an HTTP entity. Additionally, there are shortcomings to the
      purely text-based HTTP Common Log Format that need to be addressed in
      order to allow for real-time inspection of SIP log files <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-sipclf-problem-statement"></xref>. Experience
      with Apache Common Log Format has shown that dealing with large
      quantities of log data can be very processor intensive, as doing so
      necessarily requires reading and parsing every byte in the log file(s)
      of interest.</t>

      <t>An implementation independent framework for the SIP CLF has been
      defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-sipclf-problem-statement"></xref>.
      This memo describes an indexed text file format for logging SIP messages
      received and sent by SIP clients, servers, and proxies that adheres to
      the data model presented in Section 8 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-sipclf-problem-statement"></xref>. This document
      defines a format that is no more difficult to generate by logging
      entities than standard (i.e., non-indexed) text log formats, while being radically faster to process. In particular, the format is optimized for both rapidly scanning through log records, as well as quickly locating commonly accessed data fields.</t>

      <t>Further, the format proposed by this document retains the key
      advantage of being human readable and able to be processed using the
      various Unix text processing tools, such as sed, awk, perl, cut, and
      grep.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
      
      <t>"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", and "NOT RECOMMENDED" are appropriate when valid exceptions to a general requirement are known to exist or appear to exist, and it is infeasible or impractical to enumerate all of them.  However, they should not be interpreted as permitting implementors to fail to implement the general requirement when such failure would result in interoperability failure.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC3261"></xref> defines additional terms used in this
      document that are specific to the SIP domain such as "proxy";
      "registrar"; "redirect server"; "user agent server" or "UAS"; "user
      agent client" or "UAC"; "back-to-back user agent" or "B2BUA"; "dialog";
      "transaction"; "server transaction".</t>

      <t>This document uses the term "SIP Server" that is defined to include
      the following SIP entities: user agent server, registrar, redirect
      server, a SIP proxy in the role of user agent server, and a B2BUA in the
      role of a user agent server.</t>

    <section anchor="Document_Conventions" title="Document Conventions">
      <t>This document defines the logging syntax for the SIP CLF. This syntax
      is demonstrated through the use of various examples. The formatting
      described here does not permit these examples to be unambiguously
      rendered due to the constraints imposed by the formatting rules for
      RFCs. To avoid ambiguity and to meet the RFC layout requirements this document uses the &lt;allOneLine/&gt; markup convention established in <xref target="RFC4475"></xref>.</t>

      <t>For the sake of clarity and completeness, the entire text defining
      this markup convention from Section 2.1 of <xref
      target="RFC4475"></xref> is quoted below:</t>

      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>Several of these examples contain unfolded lines longer than 72
          characters. These are captured between &lt;allOneLine/&gt; tags. The
          single unfolded line is reconstructed by directly concatenating all
          lines appearing between the tags (discarding any line feeds or
          carriage returns). There will be no whitespace at the end of lines.
          Any whitespace appearing at a fold-point will appear at the
          beginning of a line.</t>

      <t>The format presented in <xref target="common_log_format"></xref> is
      for a single SIP CLF log entry. While there is no actual subdivision in
      practice, this format can be logically subdivided into the following
      three distinct components: <list style="empty">
          <t>1. Index Pointers - The first 60-bytes of this format. This
          portion is metadata, primarily composed of a list of pointers that
          indicate the beginning of both the variable length mandatory and
          optional fields that are logged as part of this record. These
          pointers are implemented as a mechanism to improve processing of
          these records and to allow a reader to expeditiously skip directly to
          the desired field without unnecessarily going through the entire
          record. This logical subdivision within the SIP CLF format will be
          referenced in this document with the &lt;IndexPointers&gt; tag. A 0x0A (LF character) delimits &lt;IndexPointers&gt; from the next logical grouping.</t>

          <t>2. Mandatory Fields - The next logical grouping in this format is
          a tab (0x09) delimited listing of the mandatory fields as described in
          Section 8.1 of <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-sipclf-problem-statement"></xref> and in the order
          listed in &lt;IndexPointers&gt;. This logical subdivision within the
          SIP CLF format will be referenced in this document with the
          &lt;MandatoryFields&gt; tag.</t>

          <t>3. Optional Fields - The last logical component MAY be present as
          it is an OPTIONAL extension to the SIP CLF format. Its purpose is to
          provide flexibility to the developer of this SIP CLF to log any
          desired fields not included in &lt;MandatoryFields&gt;. This
          includes SIP bodies and any vendor-specific extensions. This logical
          subdivision within the SIP CLF format will be referenced in this
          document with the &lt;OptionalFields&gt; tag.</t>

The representation of this format is a two line record where the &lt;IndexPointers&gt; metadata is on one line and the actual data like &lt;MandatoryFields&gt; and
      &lt;OptionalFields&gt; (if present) is on another.</t>

      <t>In the following sections note that indications of "hexadecimal encoded" indicate that the value is to be written out in human-readable base-16 numbers using the UTF-8 characters 0x30 through 0x39 ('0' through '9') and 0x41 through 0x46 ('A' through 'F'). Similarly, indications of "decimal encoded" indicate that the value is to be written out in human readable base-10 number using the UTF-8 characters 0x30 through 0x39 ('0' through '9'). In both encodings, numbers always take up the number of bytes indicated, and are padded on the left with UTF-8 '0' (zero) characters to fill the entire space.</t>

            the transaction identifier associated with the server transaction.
            Implementations can reuse the server transaction identifier (the
            topmost branch-id of the incoming request, with or without the
            magic cookie), or they could generate a unique identification
            string for a server transaction (this identifier needs to be
            locally unique to the server only.) This identifier is used to
            correlate ACKs and CANCELs to an INVITE transaction; it is also
            used to aid in forking. (See Section 9.4 of <xref

            <t hangText="Client-Txn:">Client transaction identification code -
            this field is used to associate client transactions with a server
            transaction for forking proxies or B2BUAs. Upon forking,
            implementations can reuse the value they inserted into the topmost
            Via header's branch parameter, or they can generate a unique
            identification string for the client transaction. (See Section 9.4
            of <xref target="I-D.ietf-sipclf-problem-statement"></xref> for
            usage.)</t>
            
            <t>Note: The definitions of the Server-Txn and Client-Txn are taken directly from <xref target="I-D.ietf-sipclf-problem-statement"></xref> and are provided here only as a convenience to the implementer. The definitions specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-sipclf-problem-statement"></xref> should be considered authoritative in the event of a conflict.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>This data MUST appear in the order listed in &lt;IndexPointers&gt;,
        and each field MUST be present. Fields are subject the maximum SIP CLF
        field size of 4096 bytes as detailed in Section 8 of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-sipclf-problem-statement"></xref> and are separated
        by a single UTF-8 Tab character (0x09). Any Tab characters present in
        the data to be written will be replaced by a UTF-8 space character
        (0x20) prior to being logged.</t>
        
        <t>The decision to replace tabs with spaces was based on there being no known use of tabs in SIP messages to convey any other meaning than whitespace.  Two consequences of the decision to replace tab with a space character are: (a) it will become impossible to reconstruct a signature over the logged field that matches the signature over fields in the original SIP message, and (b) any future SIP header fields that include tabs with a different semantic meaning than simply signifying whitespace will lose this meaning when logged.  And finally, the tabs to spaces substitution MUST occur when logging mandatory fields and optional SIP Header Field or Reason-Phrase (Tag=00); it SHOULD occur when when optionally logging either the entire message (Tag=02) or simply a SIP body (Tag=01) as described in <xref target="OptionalFields"></xref>.</t>
        
        <t>An element will not always have an appropriate value to provide for one of these fields, even when the field is required to appear in the SIP CLF record. In such circumstances, when a given mandatory field is not present then that empty field MUST be encoded as a single horizontal dash ("-").</t>

        <t>In the event that a field failed to parse it MUST be encoded as a
        single question mark ("?"). If these characters are part of a sequence
        of other characters, then there is no ambiguity. If the field being
        logged contains only one character, and that character is the literal
        "-", the implementation SHOULD insert an escaped %2D for that field in
        the SIP CLF record. Similarly, if the field contains only one
        character, and that character is the literal "?", the implementation
        SHOULD insert an escaped %3F for that field in the SIP CLF record.</t>
        
        <t>The carriage return line feed (CRLF) at the end of a given header field value MUST NOT be logged. Thus, mandatory fields MUST NOT contain a CRLF when logged so no escaping mechanism is required for it.</t>
        
        <t>Clearly a SIP parser could not possibly successfully parse a SIP CLF record in its entirety given the SIP CLF format described in this document. It is possible to parse individual fields in the SIP CLF record if they are extracted and given to a SIP parser that would normally parse those sequence of strings. It should be noted that as a result of the escaping mechanisms used in this document ('-' and '?') a field that would normally be able to parse if it appeared in a SIP header (as opposed to a log file) may not be syntactically parsable by a SIP parser.</t>

        <t>Optional fields are those SIP message elements that are not a part
        of the mandatory fields list detailed in Section 8.1 of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-sipclf-problem-statement"></xref>. After the
        &lt;MandatoryFields&gt; section, there is an OPTIONAL
        &lt;OptionalFields&gt; group (shown in <xref
        target="optional_fields"></xref>) that MAY appear zero or more times.
        This &lt;OptionalFields&gt; group provides extensibility to the SIP
        CLF. It allows SIP CLF implementers the flexibility to extend the
        logging capability of this indexed text representation beyond just the
        mandatory log elements described in Section 8.1 of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-sipclf-problem-statement"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Logging any optional SIP elements MUST be done according to the
        format shown in <xref target="optional_fields"></xref>. The location
        of the start of &lt;OptionalFields&gt; within the SIP CLF record is
        indicated by the "Optional Fields Start Pointer" field in
        &lt;IndexPointers&gt;. After the initial Tab delimiter byte (0x09)
        shown in <xref target="optional_fields"></xref>, the optional field
        being logged is generally represented by the notation:</t>

        <t><list hangIndent="22" style="hanging">
            <t>Tag@Vendor-ID,Length,Value</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The optional field identifier (Tag@Vendor-ID) is composed of a two
        byte Tag and an eight byte Vendor-ID (both decimal encoded) separated
        by an "@" character (0x40). This uniquely identifies the optional
        field being logged. The format for this identifier is loosely modeled
        after the private use option used by the Syslog protocol <xref
        target="RFC5424"></xref> (Note: this is the second format detailed in
        Section 6.3.2 of <xref target="RFC5424"></xref>). It makes use of the
        Private Enterprise Number (PEN), which provides an identifier through
        a globally unique name space <xref target="PEN"></xref>. This syntax
        provides the necessary extensibility to SIP CLF to allow logging of
        any SIP header, body, as well as any vendor-specified SIP element.</t>

        <t>Optional fields are logged according to the following two syntax
        rules:</t>

        <t><list counter="my_count" style="format (%d)">
            <t>Vendor-ID = 00000000</t>
          </list></t>

        <t><list style="empty">
            <t>A Vendor-ID of zero is used to log the entire SIP message,

            a part of the mandatory fields list detailed in Section 8.1 of
            <xref target="I-D.ietf-sipclf-problem-statement"></xref>. The
            following Tag values are used to identify which of these optional
            elements are being logged:</t>

            <?rfc subcompact="no" ?>

            <t><list style="hanging">
                <t
                hangText="Tag = 00 - Log SIP Header Field or Reason-Phrase"></t>

                <t>When logging a SIP Header Field (Tag=00), the associated
                "Value" field MUST be populated by the entire header field
                being logged. That is, the field-name, the associated colon
                (":") and the field-value. This mechanism provides the
                capability to optionally log any SIP header field by
                identifying the field being logged within the "Value"
                field.</t>

                <t>Because the Reason-Phrase in a response is part of the
                Status-Line and is not identified with a field-name, it is a
                special case. In this instance, the the associated "Value"
                field MUST be populated by the name "Reason-Phrase" followed
                by a colon (":") and a single space (SP) between the colon and
                the logged Reason-Phrase value.</t>

                <t>The corresponding "Length" field includes the length of the
                entire "Value" field. This includes the field-name, the colon,
                and any LWS separator.</t>

                <t>If an optional field occurs more than once in a SIP message
                (e.g. Contact, Route, Record-Route, etc.) then each occurrence
                MUST be logged with the same Tag value (i.e., Tag=00) as a distinct optional field entry in the SIP CLF record. These repeated optionally logged header fields MUST preserve the ordinal position of the repeated header fields in the SIP header.  For example, a SIP header containing two Via header fields with the following ordinal positions within the SIP header: V1,V2. If optionally logging these header fields they would occur as the following entries in the SIP CLF record. (Note: For the sake of brevity this example only shows how these optional header fields would be logged and omits the remainder of the SIP CLF record):</t>

        		]]></artwork></figure></t>
        		
				<t>The CRLF at the end of a given header field value MUST NOT be logged. Thus, optional SIP header fields logged with Tag=00 MUST NOT contain a CRLF when logged so no escaping mechanism is required for it.</t>
        				
                <t hangText="Tag = 01 - Log message body"></t>

                <t>SIP message bodies of all types can be optionally logged using Tag=01.  If the message body is logged it MUST adhere to the maximum size limitation of 4096 bytes for a SIP CLF field, as detailed in Section 8 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-sipclf-problem-statement"></xref>. Unlike with Tag=00, there can only be a single entry in the SIP CLF record with Tag=01. When optionally logging the message body if the maximum SIP CLF field size of 4096 bytes is exceeded the message body being logged MUST be truncated to meet these size limitations.</t>

                <t>When logging a message body (Tag=01), the associated
                "Value" field is populated with the Content-Type itself plus
                the SIP message body separated with a space. In this manner, everything about the SIP message body is self-described using a single tag as compared to enumerating a separate tag for each body type. Additionally, the corresponding "Length" field includes the SIP message body, the length of the embedded Content-Type, and the space separator between the MIME type and the body content. Note that binary bodies MUST be base64 encoded to render them in the SIP CLF log file.</t>
                
                <t>If an optionally logged SIP message body contains any CRLFs they MUST be escaped by using the URI encoded equivalent value of "%0D%0A". This escaping mechanism applies to all body types.</t>

                <t hangText="Tag = 02 - Log entire SIP message"></t>

                <t>The entire SIP message (i.e., SIP header and message body) can be optionally logged using a Tag=02. Logging the entire SIP message MUST conform to the maximum size limitation of 4096 bytes for a SIP CLF field, as detailed in Section 8 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-sipclf-problem-statement"></xref>. Unlike with Tag=00, there can only be a single entry in the SIP CLF record with Tag=02. When optionally logging the entire SIP message if the maximum SIP CLF field size of 4096 bytes is exceeded the entire SIP message being logged MUST be truncated to meet these size limitations.</t>
                
                <t>All instances of CRLFs, whether they appear in the SIP headers or the SIP message body MUST be escaped by using the URI encoded equivalent value of "%0D%0A".</t>

      <t>Within a field line, script tools can quickly split fields at the tab
