Internet-Draft          DNRD JSON Response Format              June 2012


1.  Introduction

   Internet registries for both number resources and names have
   historically maintained a lookup service to permit public access to
   some portion of the registry database.  Most registries offer the
   service via the WHOIS protocol [RFC3912], with additional services
   being offered via world wide web pages, bulk downloads, and other
   services, such as RPSL [RFC2622].

   Although the WHOIS protocol specified in [RFC3912] is widely adopted
   and supported, it has several shortcomings that limits its usefulness
   to the evolving needs of the Internet community.  For example, the
   WHOIS protocol has not been Internationalized, it does not
   consistently support Internationalized Domain Name (IDN, described in
   [RFC5890]); WHOIS has no query and response format; and WHOIS
   protocol does not support user authentication, access control for
   differentiated access.

   Recently, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) chartered a new
   working group to standardize a web-based (RESTful) Extensible
   Registration Data Access Protocol.  This document, to be read in
   conjunction with the RESTful Query draft
   [draft-hollenbeck-dnrd-ap-query-01], describes the response
   specification for querying registration data through RESTful web
   service.

   The response formats for querying domain, contact, nameserver name
   and registrar are defined in JSON, which is specified based on a
   subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd
   Edition - December 1999 ([ECMA-262]) and [RFC4627].


2.  Convention Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.1.  Abbreviations and Terminology

   Domain Name Registration Data (DNRD) - refers to the information that
   registrants provide when registering a domain name.  Registrars and
   registries collect this information and typically make a subset
   available to the public via the Whois service.

   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight data-interchange
   format.  It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming
   Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999 ([ECMA-262])

   and [RFC4627].

   Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architecture
   style for distributed systems such as the World Wide Web (Chapter 5
   of Fielding's dissertation is [REST]).

   RESTful web service is a web service implemented using HTTP and the
   principles of REST.  It is a collection of resources, with four
   defined aspects:

   o  The base URI for the web service, such as
      http://example.com/resources/.

   o  The Internet media type of the data supported by the web service.
      This is often JSON, XML or YAML but can be any other valid
      Internet media type.

   o  The set of operations supported by the web service using HTTP
      methods (e.g., GET, PUT, POST, or DELETE).

   o  The API must be hypertext driven.


3.  Response Format Specification

   This section describes the response format specification for querying
   domain name, nameserver, contact and registrar.  The specific format
   is defined in JSON.  The basic querying URLs are described in the
   draft-hollenbeck-dnrd-ap-query-01.

   The following response objects defined MAY be supported optionally by
   each registry.  Clients processing JSON responses MUST be prepared
   for values specified in this document to be absent from a response as
   no JSON value listed in this document is required to appear in the
   response.  In other words, the server can remove the values as is
   needed by the policy of the registries.

3.1.  Domain Name Response Specification

   This section gives the set of required information and format that
   SHOULD be included in the domain name responses.  An extension
   interface MAY also be defined for customized response information.

   The corresponding querying URI example is:

   http://example.com/dnrd-ap/domain/example.com/ or
   http://example.com/dnrd-ap/example.com/

Internet-Draft          DNRD JSON Response Format              June 2012


   The following is an elided example of a JSON response for a domain
   query:



   {
     "domain": {
     ...
     },
     "nameserver": [
     ...
     ],
     "contact": [
     ...
     ],
     "registrar": {
     ...
     },
     "extension": {
     ...
     }
   }


3.1.1.  Objects in the Domain Name Response

   There are "domain", "nameserver", "contact", "registrar" and
   "extension" objects included in the domain response.  The followings
   are description and explanation of objects members.

   domain -- contains the information about the domain.  The members of
   domain object are defined as below.

   o  domainName -- contains the fully qualified name of the registered
      domain.

   o  roid -- the identifier assigned to the domain name when the object
      was created.

   o  domainStatus -- an array contains the current status values
      defined in [RFC5731].

   o  clientID -- element that contains the identifier of the sponsoring
      client.

   o  createID -- contains the identifier of the client that created the
      domain.

   o  creationDate -- the date and time when the domain name is
      registered.  The date and time values MUST be represented in
      Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

   o  expirationDate -- the date and time when the domain name is
      expiry.  The date and time values MUST be represented in Universal
      Coordinated Time (UTC).

   o  updateID -- contains the identifier of the client that updated the
      domain.

   o  updateDate -- the date and time when the domain name is updated.
      The date and time values MUST be represented in Universal
      Coordinated Time (UTC).

   o  transferDate -- the date and time of the most recent successful
      transfer.  The date and time values MUST be represented in
      Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).  If no tranfer occurs, this key
      MUST not be provided.

   o  dnssec -- the status of DNSSEC deployment.  A value of "Signed" or
      "Yes" means that DNSSEC has been deployed.  A value of "Unsigned"
      or "No" means that DNSSEC has not been deployed yet.

   nameserver -- an array that contains the information about the
   nameserver or host.  If the array object is a nameserver,
   "namerserverName" and "nameserverUri" SHOULD be the members of the
   array object.  If the array object is a host, "host" and "hostUri"
   SHOULD be the members of the array object.  Nameserver information is
   specified before host information.  The members of nameserver object
   are defined as below.

   o  nameserverName -- the fully qualified names of the delegated host
      objects.

   o  nameserverUri -- the access address for detailed information about
      nameserver.

4.  Accept Header

   Clients MAY use a MIME type, such as "application/json" to desire the
   JSON format of response.  The server SHOULD respond the client with
   the proper MIME type in the accept header, and give the above
   response in JSON format.


5.  Internationalization Considerations

5.1.  Encoding Specification

   The response format MUST has a key for defining encoding format, such
   as "encoding", to explicitly demonstrate the character encoding that
   the server can support.  Both the U-label and A-label domain names
   can be included in the response.

5.2.  IDN Variants

   Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs), particularly variants, brought
   about the need for multiple domain names to be registered and managed
   as a single package, or registration bundle.  The bundle variant
   domain names share some attributes, such as expiration date and the
   registrar.  So when users update any properties within a bundle, all
   of the domains' attributes in the bundle will be changed.

   The response SHOULD be able to be extended to support the IDN
   variants to show the list of the bundle variant domain names.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not specify any IANA actions.


7.  Security considerations

   TBD
