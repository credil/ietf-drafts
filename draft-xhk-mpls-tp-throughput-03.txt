        Throughput Measurement for MPLS-based Transport Networks
                    draft-xhk-mpls-tp-throughput-03

Abstract

   An important Operation, Administration and Maintenance (OAM)
   requirement of the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is the ability to
   measure the throughput (i.e. bandwidth) of an MPLS-TP connection
   which could be an MPLS-TP PseudoWire (PW), Label Switched Path (LSP)
   or Section.  This document specifies the OAM packet formats and
   procedures for both one-way and two-way throughput measurement in
   MPLS-TP.

Internet-Draft        Thput Measurement for MPLS-TP         October 2011


1.  Introduction

   Requirements for OAM in MPLS-TP Networks (section 2.2.5) [RFC5860]
   specifies that the OAM toolset must provide a function to enable
   conducting diagnostic tests on a PseudoWire (PW), Label Switched Path
   (LSP) or Section.  According to [RFC5860], this function should be
   performed on-demand.  An example of such a diagnostic test would be
   measuring the available bandwidth of an LSP.

   The above required sub-function of diagnostic tests is specified as
   "throughput measurement" in this document.  As defined in section
   6.3.1 of [RFC6371], throughput measurement is an on-demand out-of-
   service function.  Throughput measurement is performed between two
   Maintenance Entity Group End Points (MEPs) in one-way or two-way
   mode.

   This document specifies the OAM packet formats and procedures for
   both one-way and two-way throughput measurement in MPLS-TP.  It must
   be noted that the OAM packet formats and procedures for throughput
   measurement is actually a variation of loss measurement protocol
   which is specified in [RFC6374].  The purpose of this document is to
   specify the adaptation to loss measurement protocol for achieving
   throughput measurement.

2.  Overview

   In [RFC1242], the throughput is defined as a performance metric for a
   network interconnection device.  It is defined as "the maximum rate
   at which none of the offered frames are dropped by the device".  In
   MPLS-TP context, the definition of throughput is applied to an
   MPLS-TP connection which could be an MPLS-TP PW, LSP or Section.

2.1.  Throughput Measurement Modes

   As per [RFC2544], the throughput measurement procedure is specified
   as sending a specific number of frames at a specific rate through the
   Device Under Test (DUT) and then counting the frames that are
   transmitted by the DUT.  If the count of offered frames is equal to
   the count of received frames, the fewer frames are received than that
   were transmitted, the rate of the offered stream is reduced and the
   test is rerun.  The throughput is the fastest rate at which the count
   of test frames transmitted by the DUT is equal to the number of test
   frames sent by the test equipment.  But in many practical throughput
   measurement scenarios, usually the throughput is measured by test
   equipment using the binary search algorithm.  In this case, multiple
   sets of test traffic ('run') are sent in one process of throughput
   measurement.  In this document, the 'run count' indicates how many
   sets of test traffic are sent.

   If the implementation simplicity is chosen over the precision of
   throughput measurement, the measurement method described in [RFC2544]
   should be used.  This is also called 'estimated mode'.  The
   measurement methods described in this document are for measuring
   throughput with precision and efficiency; this method is referred to
   as 'measured mode'.  In estimated mode, the measurement process is
   controlled by the operator and no control packet exchange takes place
   between the two MEPs.  In measured mode, the control packet exchange



Xiao, et al.             Expires April 12, 2012                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        Thput Measurement for MPLS-TP         October 2011


   takes place between the two MEPs.  The control packets are defined in
   section 3 and the detailed methods are described in section 4.

2.2.  One-way Throughput Measurement

   One-way throughput measurement (OWTM) SHOULD be supported for both
   unidirectional and bidirectional MPLS-TP connection.  One-way
   throughput indicates the throughput for the forward direction of the
   connection from the initiator MEP, which initiates the process of
   throughput measurement and stays active throughout the whole process.

   Estimated mode: The initiator MEP sends test traffic and the peer MEP
   calculates the test data packet loss.

   Measured mode: The initiator MEP controls the whole process of
   measurement and the peer MEP acts as a responder.

   Note that for a unidirectional MPLS-TP connection (such as a
   unidirectional LSP) without return path, only the estimated mode
   SHOULD be used.

2.3.  Two-way Throughput Measurement

   Two-way throughput measurement (TWTM) SHOULD be supported for only
   bidirectional MPLS-TP connection.  Two-way throughput indicates both
   the throughputs for the forward and the reverse direction of the
   connection from the initiator MEP.

   Estimated mode: Only the initiator MEP sends test traffic and the
   peer MEP loopbacks all received test data packets.  Only the minimum
   of avaiable throughput of the two directions are considered.

   Measured mode: Both the initiator MEP and the peer MEP send test
   traffic, and the initiator MEP controls the whole process of
   measurement.  In this case, the two individual available throughputs
   of the two directions are considered.


3.  Packet Format

   For throughput measurement in estimated mode, only the test data
   packets would be sent by the MEP.  For throughput measurement in
   measured mode, the specific packets sent by the MEP can be divided
   into control packets and test data packets.  The control packets flow
   over the Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) [RFC5586] of an MPLS-TP
   connection and perform signaling between the initiator MEP and the
   peer MEP.  The test data packets compose the test traffic which
   emulates the real user traffic.

         Tx Counter

            Tx Counter is set to the number of throughput measurement
            test data packets sent by the local MEP (i.e. the MEP
            sending this control message) in this run.

         Rx Counter

            Rx Counter is set to the number of throughput measurement
            test data packets received by the local MEP (i.e. the MEP
            sending this control message) in this run.

3.2.  Throughput Measurement Test Data Packet Format

   Whether the throughput measurement is performed in estimated mode or
   measured mode, the format of a throughput measurement test data
   packet would be the same.  In order to simplify the implementation of
   MPLS-TP OAM functions, the format of a throughput measurement test
   data packet should be aligned with the format of a data plane
   loopback test data packet.  As indicated in section 3.1, four pattern
   types of throughput measurement test data packets can be constructed
   based on Padding field and optional CRC-32 field.


4.  Operation

   As specified in section 1, throughput measurement is an on-demand
   out-of-service function.  Before throughput measurement is initiated,
   the diagnosed Maintenance Entity Group (MEG) SHOULD be put into a
   Lock status, and an MEG can be put into a Lock status either via
   Network Management System (NMS) action or using the Lock Instruct OAM
   tool which is required in [RFC5860] and specified in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-li-lb].

   It should be noted that in estimated mode, for different test data
   packet size, or test data packet pattern, or test data packet PHB, or
   step length of sending rate, or even sending duration of test
   traffic, different result of throughput measurement may be obtained.
   Thus all these parameters SHOULD be configurable for throughput
   measurement in the estimated mode.  Also note that in measured mode,
   for different test data packet size, or test data packet pattern, or
   test data packet PHB, or expected measurement resolution, or even
   sending duration of test traffic, different result of throughput
   measurement may be obtained.  They SHOULD be configurable for
   throughput measurement in the measured mode.  Besides, optional
   acceptable frame loss rate would be provisioned in measured mode if
   needed.  Also note that the set of PHB value of control packets would
   follow the provisioned test data packet PHB.

4.1.  Throughput Measurement Procedures in Estimated Mode

   For OWTM, the initiator MEP sends test traffic with the provisioned
   initial sending rate for the first run, and then the peer MEP will
   calculate test data packet loss according to Sequence-Number field of
   the test data packet.  If the calculated Packet Loss (one-way) is
   equal to zero, then the operator will increase the sending rate with
   a fixed step length (e.g. 100 kb/s) manually and command the
   initiator MEP to send a test traffic with the increased sending rate
   for rerun.  Thus the initiator MEP will gradually increase its
   sending rate until the calculated Packet Loss (one-way) is not equal
   to zero for a certain run, and the sending rate for the last run is
   the measured one-way throughput.

   For TWTM, the peer MEP SHOULD be put into a Loopback status, and this
   can be achieved via NMS action.  The initiator MEP sends test traffic
   with the provisioned initial sending rate for the first run, and the
   peer MEP loops all received test data packets back, and then the
   initiator MEP itself will calculate test data packet loss by
   comparing the sent and received test data packets.  If calculated
   Packet Loss (two-way) is equal to zero, then the sending rate will be
   increased with a fixed step length (e.g. 100kb/s) automatically and
   the initiator MEP will send test traffic with the increased sending
   rate for rerun.  Thus the initiator MEP will gradually increase its
   sending rate until the calculated Packet Loss (two-way) is not equal
   to zero for a certain run, and the sending rate for the last run is
   the measured two-way throughput.

4.2.1.  Transmitting a Throughput Measurement Start Request

   After initiating a throughput measurement operation, the initiator
   MEP will at first transmit a throughput measurement Start Request to
   the peer MEP.  Also note that at the start of every rerun of sending
   test traffic, the initiator MEP would also transmit this message.

   For OWTM, this message is intended to inform the peer MEP about the
   start of test traffic sending and trigger the peer MEP to start
   counting test data packets.  For TWTM, this message is further
   intended to convey necessary test parameters to the peer MEP and
   trigger the peer MEP to send test traffic.  Run Count and Sending
   Rate in this message would be changed for the rerun.  Also note that
   for both one-way and two-way measurement, the initiator MEP would
   start counting test data packets as soon as it transmits this
   message.

4.2.2.  Receiving a Throughput Measurement Start Request

   Upon the reception of a throughput measurement Start Request, the
   peer MEP must inspect this message at first, if no unexpected field
   or value is found then the peer MEP should start counting test data
   packets.  In addition, if the received W-flag indicates that this is
   a TWTM, then the peer MEP should also start sending test traffic
   after it starts counting test data packets.

4.2.3.  Transmitting a Throughput Measurement Start Reply

   After receiving a throughput measurement Start Request, the peer MEP
   must transmit a throughput measurement Start Reply to the initiator
   MEP.  The Control Code in Start Reply Message should be set to 0x0 to
   reflect the successful operation at the peer MEP.  On the contrary
   set to 0x1 to reflect the failed operation at the peer MEP.  Except
   the R-flag and Control Code field, other fields of Start Reply
   Message will be copied from the received Start Request Message.

4.2.4.  Receiving a Throughput Measurement Start Reply

   Upon the reception of a throughput measurement Start Reply, the
   initiator MEP must inspect this message at first.  If no unexpected
   field or value is found, and the received Control Code indicates
   successful operation at the peer MEP, then the initiator MEP should
   start sending test traffic.  If an unexpected field or value is found
   while inspecting this message, or the received Control Code indicates
   failed operation at the peer MEP, or there is no throughput
   measurement Start Reply received after a while (e.g. 1 second), then
   an implementation dependent specific error should be returned at the
   initiator MEP.  In this case, no test traffic will be sent from the

   initiator MEP.

4.2.5.  Sending and Receiving Test Traffic

   From the above procedures it can be seen that for TWTM, the pair of
   MEPs will send test traffic asynchronously, and the peer MEP will
   start/stop sending test traffic some time earlier than the initiator
   MEP.  This asynchronous behavior has no side-effect on the
   measurement result because both MEPs shall start counting test data
   packets before they send/receive any test traffic.

   Also note that when the initiator MEP sends test traffic, for the
   first run the test parameters are all derived from the initial
   configuration.  For the reruns, the sending rate is changed and
   derived from the local calculation.  When the peer MEP sends test
   traffic, the test parameters are all derived from the received Start
   Request Message.

4.2.6.  Transmitting a Throughput Measurement Stop Request

   For every run, after the initiator MEP finishes sending test traffic,
   it transmits a throughput measurement Stop Request to the peer MEP.
   This message is to inform the peer MEP to stop the test traffic from
   the initiator MEP.  It triggers the peer MEP to stop counting test
   data packets and feed back the counters.

4.2.7.  Receiving a Throughput Measurement Stop Request

   Upon the reception of a throughput measurement Stop Request, the peer
   MEP must inspect this message at first.  If no unexpected field or
   value is found then the peer MEP should stop counting test data
   packets.  Also note that for TWTM, as indicated in section 4.2.5, the
   peer MEP stops sending test traffic before it receives a throughput
   measurement Stop Request.

4.2.8.  Transmitting a Throughput Measurement Stop Reply

   After receiving a throughput measurement Stop Request, the peer MEP
   transmits a throughput measurement Stop Reply to the initiator MEP.
   The Control Code in Stop Reply Message should be set to 0x0 to
   reflect the successful operation at the peer MEP.  On the contrary
   set to 0x1 to reflect the failed operation at the peer MEP.  The Tx
   Counter and Rx Counter in the Stop Reply Message are set to the test
   data packet count at the peer MEP.

Internet-Draft        Thput Measurement for MPLS-TP         October 2011


4.2.9.  Receiving a Throughput Measurement Stop Reply

   Upon the reception of a throughput measurement Stop Reply, the
   initiator MEP must inspect this message at first.  If no unexpected
   field or value is found, and the received Control Code indicates
   successful operation at the peer MEP, then the initiator MEP should
   stop counting test data packets and start calculating the test data
   packet loss.  Suppose the Tx Counter and Rx Counter locally are TxP1
   and RxP1 for the initiator MEP, and in Stop Reply Message are TxP2
   and RxP2 for the peer MEP.

   For OWTM, the calculation formula is as follows:

   Packet Loss (one-way) = TxP1 - RxP2

   For TWTM, the calculation formulas are as follows:

   Packet Loss (forward) = TxP1 - RxP2

   Packet Loss (reverse) = TxP2 - RxP1

   If an unexpected field or value is found while inspecting this
   message, or the received Control Code indicates failed operation at
   the peer MEP, or there is no throughput measurement Stop Reply
   received after a while (e.g. 1 second), then an implementation
   dependent specific error should be returned at the initiator MEP.  In
   this case, no calculation for test data packet loss will be executed.

4.2.10.  Consequent Actions and Searching Algorithm

   Procedures for one run of test traffic sending and test data packet
   loss calculation have been described above in details, but usually
   iterative reruns of the procedures are needed for a throughput
   measurement.  Whether the rerun is needed or not depends on the
   calculated test data packet loss and the expected measurement
   resolution.  For OWTM, if calculated Packet Loss (one-way) is equal
   to zero and the expected measurement resolution is met, then rerun is
   not needed.  Thus the current sending rate is the measured one-way
   throughput.  For TWTM, if calculated Packet Loss (forward) and Packet
   Loss (reverse) are both equal to zero, and the expected measurement
   resolution for both forward and reverse directions is met, then rerun
   is not needed.  Thus the current sending rate for forward/reverse
   direction is the measured forward/reverse throughput.

   The standard binary search algorithm is applied to calculate the
   sending rate for the next run, which is the only changed test
   parameter compared with this run.  For example, suppose to measure
   the throughput of a connection whose actual throughput is 70Mbps, the



Xiao, et al.             Expires April 12, 2012                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft        Thput Measurement for MPLS-TP         October 2011


   provisioned initial sending rate is 100Mbps and the specified
   measurement resolution is 0.1.  Note that the initial sending rate
   MUST be no less than the actual throughput, otherwise the binary
   search is not applicable, and so it's often set to the maximum
   theoretical throughput of the measured connection.  For the first
   run, packet loss is found, so for the second run, the sending rate
   will be calculated as (100+0)/2 = 50Mbps, no packet loss is found,
   then the resolution will be calculated as (100-50)/50 = 1, which is
   bigger than 0.1, the expected measurement resolution is not met, so
   for the third run, the sending rate will be calculated as (100+50)/2
   = 75Mbps, packet loss is found, so for the fourth run, the sending
   rate will be calculated as (50+75)/2 = 62.5Mbps, no packet loss is
   found, then the resolution will be calculated as (75-62.5)/62.5 =
   0.2, which is bigger than 0.1, the expected measurement resolution is
   not met, so for the fifth run, the sending rate will be calculated as
   (75+62.5)/2 = 68.75Mbps, no packet loss is found, then the resolution
   will be calculated as (68.75-62.5)/68.75 = 0.09, which is smaller
   than 0.1, the expected measurement resolution is met, so the
   measurement finished and the rate 68.75Mbps is the measured
   throughput.

   As indicated in front of this section, a threshold on the acceptable
   frame loss rate MAY be set before throughput measurement, in this
   case it's not required that absolutely no packet loss exists, and the
   pre-provisioned acceptable frame loss rate needs to be taken into
   account when judging whether the throughput is got after every run.


5.  Throughput Measurement Time

   The throughput measurement time is about the product of sending
   duration for one run and number of all run times.  The sending
   duration for one run is provisioned before the throughput measurement
   starts, and the number of all run times is related to several factors
   which include the provisioned initial sending rate, the applied
   searching algorithm and the specified expected measurement
   resolution.  Obviously longer sending duration would result in more
   precise measured result.  But if shorter throughput measurement time
   is required, there should be a balance between them.  On the other
   hand, for throughput measurement in estimated mode, the shorter step
   length and the shorter measurement time are mutually exclusive.
   Similarly in measured mode, the higher measurement resolution and the
   shorter measurement time are mutually exclusive - so the balance
   between them is also needed.
