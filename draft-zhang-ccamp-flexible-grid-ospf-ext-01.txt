1. Introduction 

   [G.694.1v1] defines the Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) 
   frequency grids for WDM applications. A frequency grid is a 
   reference set of frequencies used to denote allowed nominal central 
   frequencies that may be used for defining applications. The channel 
   spacing, i.e. the frequency spacing between two allowed nominal 
   central frequencies could be 12.5 GHz, 25 GHz, 50 GHz, 100 GHz and 
   integer multiples of 100 GHz as defined in [G.694.1v1]. All of the 
   wavelengths on a fiber should use different central frequencies and 
   occupy a fixed bandwidth of frequency.

   [G.FLEXIGRID], an updated version of [G.694.1v1] has been consented 
   in December 2011 in support of flexi-grids. The terms "frequency 
   slot (The frequency range allocated to a channel and unavailable to 
   other channels within a flexi-grid)" and "slot width" (the full 
   width of a frequency slot in a flexi-grid) are introduced to address 
   flexi-grids. A channel is represented as a LSC (Lambda Switching 
   Capable) LSP in the control plane, i.e. a LSC LSP should occupy a 
   frequency slot on each fiber it traverses. In the case of flexi-grid, 
   different LSC LSPs may have different slot width on a fiber, i.e. 
   the slot width is flexible on a fiber.  

   [WSON-OSPF] defines the OSPF-TE extensions for WSON networks, which 
   focuses on the fixed grids of DWDM. [GEN-OSPF] defines OSPF-TE 
   extensions in support of the general network element constraints   
   under the control of GMPLS. This document describes the additional 
   requirements and extensions of routing protocol brought by flexi-
   grid.  

   This document uses the DWDM link model which is shown in [SSON-FWK] 
   to describe the requirement and extensions for routing. The flexi-
   grid related terminologies can also refer to [SSON-FWK].   

2. Terminology  

   Flexi-grid: See [SSON-FWK]. 

   Slot Width: See [SSON-FWK]. 

   Frequency Range: See [SSON-FWK].

   Flexi-LSP: See [SSON-FWK].  

3. Requirements for Flexi-grid Routing  

   As described in [SSON-FWK], the main changes for routing brought by 
   flexible grid are related to the DWDM links.  

3.1. Available Frequency Ranges  

   In the case of flexi-grids, the central frequency steps from 193.1 
   THz with 6.25 GHz granularity. The central frequency is calculated 
   as follows:  

   Central Frequency = 193.1 THz + n * 0.00625 THz

draft-zhang-ccamp-flexible-grid-ospf-ext-01.txt              March 2012 
    

   Where n is a positive or negative integer including 0.  

   Different flexi-LSPs could occupy frequency slots with different 
   slot width. The frequency slot width of a flexi-LSP is defined as 
   follows:  

              Slot width = 0.0125 THz * m  

   Where m is a positive integer.  

   The frequency slot of a flexi-LSP can be determined by the slot 
   width and central frequency as follows.  

   Lowest frequency = (central frequency) - (slot width)/2 

                    = (193.1 + n * 0.00625) - (0.0125 * m)/2 

                    = (193.1 + (n - m) * 0.00625) THz; 

   Highest frequency = (central frequency) + (slot width)/2  

                    = (193.1 + n * 0.00625) + (0.0125 * m)/2 

                    = (193.1 + (n + m) * 0.00625) THz; 

   On a DWDM link, the frequency slots must not overlap with each other. 
   However, the border frequencies of two frequency slots may be the 
   same frequency, i.e. the highest frequency of a frequency slot may 
   be the lowest frequency of the next frequency slot.

                 Figure 1 - Two Frequency Slots on a link 
    
   Figure 1 shows two adjacent frequency slots on a link. The highest 
   frequency of frequency slot 1 denoted by n=2 is the lowest frequency

   of slot 2. In this example, it means that the frequency range from 
   n=-2 to n=10 is occupied and is unavailable to other flexi-LSPs.  

   Hence, the available frequency ranges should be advertised for the 
   flexi-grid DWDM links. A set of non-overlapping available frequency 
   ranges SHOULD be disseminated in order to allow efficient resource 
   management of Flexi-grid DWDM links and RSA procedures which are 
   described in section 4 of [SSON-FWK]. 

3.2. Application Compliance Considerations  

   As described in [G.FLEXIGRID], devices or applications that make use 
   of the flexi-grid may not have to be capable of supporting every 
   possible slot width or position. In other words, applications may be 
   defined where only a subset of the possible slot widths and 
   positions are required to be supported.  

   For example, an application could be defined where the nominal 
   central frequency granularity is 12.5 GHz (by only requiring values 
   of n that are even) and that only requires slot widths as a multiple 
   of 25 GHz (by only requiring values of m that are even).  

   Hence, the following information should be advertised for a flexi-
   grid DWDM link:  

   o Central frequency granularity: a multiple of 6.25 GHz. 

   o Slot width granularity: a multiple of 12.5 GHz.  

   o Slot width range: the minimal and maximal slot width supported by 
      a port.  

   The combination of slot width range and slot width granularity can 
   be used to determine the slot widths set supported by a port.  

3.3. Comparison with Fix-grid DWDM Links  

   In case of fix-grid DWDM links, each wavelength has a pre-defined 
   central frequency and all the wavelengths occupy the same frequency 
   range (channel spacing). Hence all the wavelengths in the DWDM links 
   can be identified uniquely and the status (available or not) of the 
   wavelengths can be advertised through routing protocol.

      Figure 2 - A Link supports Fixed Wavelengths with 50 GHz Channel 
                                 Spacing 
    
   Figure 2 shows a link that supports fix-grid with 50 GHz channel 
   spacing. The central frequencies of the wavelengths are pre-defined 
   by 'n' and each wavelength occupies a fixed 50 GHz frequency range 
   as described in [G.694.1v1].  

   Different from the fix-grid DWDM links, the slot width of the 
   wavelengths are flexible on a flexi-grid DWDM link as described in 
   section 2.1, i.e., the value of m in the formula is uncertain before 
   a frequency slot is allocated. So, the available frequency ranges 
   instead of the specific "wavelengths" should be advertised for a 
   flexi-grid DWDM link. 

4. Extensions  

   As described in [SSON-FWK], the network connectivity topology 
   constructed by the links/nodes and node capabilities are the same as 
   WSON which can be advertised by GMPLS routing protocol (refer to 
   section 6.2 of [RFC6163].  In case of flexi-grid, the available 
   frequency ranges instead of the specific "wavelengths" should be 
   advertised for the link, which is different from the fixed grid DWDM. 
   This section defines the GMPLS OSPF-TE extensions in support of 
   advertising the available frequency ranges for the flexi-grid DWDM 
   links.  

4.1. Available Labels Set sub-TLV  

   As described in section 2.1, the available frequency ranges other 
   than the available frequency slots should be advertised for the 
   flexi-grid DWDM links. The Available Labels Set sub-TLV defined in 
   [GEN-OSPF] can be re-used to advertise the available frequency 
   ranges for the flexi-grid DWDM links.  

   The label format defined in [FLEXIBLE-SIG] shown below MUST be used 
   to encode the Label fields in Available Labels Set sub-TLV:

   In case of Grid=1 (ITU-T DWDM), a new value of C.S. is defined for 
   flexible grid.  

   If the C.S. is set to "Flexible grid" in an Available Labels Set 
   sub-TLV, it means that the corresponding link supports flexible grid.  

   Note that according to the label format defined in [FLEXIBLE-SIG], 
   for the case where the channel spacing value is set to "Flexible 
   grid", a channel spacing of 6.25 GHz should be used in the central 
   frequency computation formula.  

4.1.1. Inclusive/Exclusive Label Range 

   The inclusive/exclusive label ranges format of Available Labels Set 
   sub-TLV defined in [GEN-OSPF] can be used for specifying the 
   frequency ranges of the flexi-grid DWDM links.  

    0                   1                   2                   3

   Note that it needs multiple Available Labels Set sub-TLVs if there 
   are multiple discontinuous frequency ranges on a link.  

4.1.2. Inclusive/Exclusive Label Lists 

   The inclusive/exclusive label lists format of Available Labels Set 
   sub-TLV defined in [GEN-OSPF] can be used for specifying the 
   available central frequencies of the flexi-grid DWDM links.

4.1.3. Bitmap

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    |    Bit Map Word #N (Highest numerical labels)                 | 
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     
   In this case, the Base Label specifies the lowest available central 
   frequency.  

   Each bit in the bit map represents a particular central frequency 
   with a value of 1/0 indicating whether the central frequency is in 
   the set or not. Bit position zero represents the lowest central 
   frequency and corresponds to the base label, while each succeeding 
   bit position represents the next central frequency logically above 
   the previous.  

4.2. Extensions to Port Label Restriction sub-TLV 

   As described in Section 3.2, there are some restrictions on a port 
   to support flexi-grid. Port Label Restriction sub-TLV is defined in

   port. A new restriction type, i.e. flexi-grid Restriction Type is 
   defined here to specify the restrictions on a port to support flexi-
   grid.

   C.F.G (Central Frequency Granularity, 8 bits): A positive integer. 
   Its value indicates the multiple of 6.25 GHz in terms of central 
   frequency granularity.  

   S.W.G (Slot Width Granularity, 8 bits): A positive integer. Its 
   value indicates the multiple of 12.5 GHz in terms of slot width 
   granularity.  

   Min Width (8 bits): A positive integer. Its value indicates the 
   multiple of 12.5 GHz in terms of the supported minimal slot width.  

   Max Width (8 bits): A positive integer. Its value indicates the 
   multiple of 12.5 GHz in terms of the supported maximal slot width.  

4.3. Examples for Label Set 

   Figure 3 shows an example of available frequency range of a flexi-
   grid DWDM link.

   The symbol '+' represents the allowed nominal central frequency. The 
   symbol "--" represents a 6.25 GHz frequency unit. The number on the 
   top of the line represents the 'n' in the frequency calculation 
   formula (193.1 + n * 0.00625). The nominal central frequency is 
   193.1 THz when n equals zero.  

   Assume that the central frequency granularity is 6.25GHz, the label 
   set can be encoded as follows: 

   Inclusive Label Range:

   o  Start Label = -2;  
   o  End Label = 8.  
    
   The available central frequencies (-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) can 
   be deduced by the Inclusive Label Range, because the Central 
   Frequency Granularity is 6.25 GHz.  

   Inclusive Label Lists:  

   o  Label 1 = -1;  
   o  Label 2 = 0;  
   o  Label 3 = 1;  
   o  Label 4 = 2;  
   o  Label 5 = 3;  
   o  Label 6 = 4;  
   o  Label 7 = 5;  
   o  Label 8 = 6;  
   o  Label 9 = 7.

   o  Base Label = -1;  
   o  Bitmap = 111111111(padded out to a full multiple of 32 bits)  
    
5. IANA Considerations 

   This document introduces a new Restriction Type for the Port Label 
   Restriction sub-TLV defined in [GEN-OSPF]:  

   Restriction Type: TBA (flexi-grid) 

6. Security Considerations 

   This document does not introduce any further security issues other 
   than those discussed in [RFC3630], [RFC4203].
