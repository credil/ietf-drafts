Abstract

   An enterprise may need to connect their applications hosted in
   offsite provider data centers to their own premises via their
   dedicated L3VPN. The draft reviews L3VPN protocols for this
   application and discusses the protocol gaps to meet the requirements
   of VPN4DC. [VPN4DC]

1. Introduction

   IP/MPLS L3VPN provides IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for its
   customers and has been widely deployed globally for a long time. The
   majority L3VPN applications are to interconnect various enterprise
   locations. Data center providers want to provide virtual private
   data center services (Virtual Private Cloud Services or VPCS) to
   enterprise companies, which enables an enterprise to buy server and
   storage resources and run its intranet applications in the
   provider's multi-tenant data center facilities. This use case drives
   enterprise companies' desire to connect hosts residing in provider
   data centers to their own locations via a secure VPN, which most
   likely is L3VPN.  This requires network providers to extend existing
   L3VPNs to DC provider locations and make this extranet access as a
   secured "intranet" access. This document explores the L3VPN
   protocols and discusses the protocol gaps to meet VPN4DC
   requirements.[VPN4DC]

3. L3VPN for an Enterprise

   Figure 1 illustrates a typical L3VPN for an enterprise. Two (or
   more) enterprise sites are interconnected by a L3VPN constructed
   over IP/MPLS backbone network. If PE based L3VPN is configured, two
   enterprise sites form one IP private network without the awareness
   of the backbone existence.

   In this L3VPN configuration, one attachment circuit (AC) connects
   Customer Edge Router (CE) and Provider Edge Router (PE). An L3VPN
   instance (Route Target and Route Distinguisher) is configured on all
   the PEs that connect to at least one CE belonging to the L3VPN. On
   each PE, an iBGP session and an LSP tunnel to each remote PE is
   configured to associate with this VPN. The iBGP is used to populate
   the VPN routes among PEs. The LSP tunnel forwards the VPN traffic
   between PEs. A PE in a L3VPN learns the routes from directly
   connected CE and vice versa. Possible protocols between PE-CE for
   route learning are static route, OSPF, RIP, or iBGP/eBGP.
   [RFC4364][RFC4577][RFC6368] Both PE and CE can dynamically learn all
   the routes from each other. Thus the L3VPN provides any-to-any host
   connectivity within the enterprise intranet at multiple sites. It is

   possible to have some policy control at PEs to constrain allowed
   route.

   IP/MPLS backbone network can support many L3VPN for different
   customers. The separated route tables (VRF) for each VPN instance
   ensure customer routes are completely separated and also separated
   from IGP routes.

   When enterprise DC operators add new hosts or a subnet in one of its
   sites, or move a set of hosts from one site to another site, the PEs
   learn the route changes from the CE and announce the changes to the
   remote PEs; the remote PEs advertise the changes to connected CEs.
   The L3VPN protocols are able to automate this routing and forwarding
   process.

   L3VPN protocols seems sufficient for this application. Operators
   often manauly configure the PE-CE protoocl due to the different
   requirements from customers.

4. L3VPN for Enterprise and Provider DC Interconnection

   When an enterprise purchases computing resources such as servers and
   storages from a DC provider, it needs the applications on these
   purchased resources to run in the same way as if they reside in the
   enterprise DC. Therefore, they would need their VPN service provider
   to extend their own VPNs to hosts in provider data centers.

   Figure 2 expands Figure 1 and illustrates this scenario. A L3VPN PE
   at Site 3 connects to a provider DC. The PE has a physical interface
   connecting DC provider cloud gateway router (CGR), which is like the
   CE of L3VPN. DC provider constructs many virtual DCs (vDC) for
   different customers and may configure many attachment circuits (AC)
   over the physical interface attached to the PE. When a L3VPN
   enterprise customer buys one vDC service (computing, storage,

   network, etc) from DC provider, it wants the vDC attaching to its
   L3VPN supported by the network provider. Existing technology
   requires DC provider and network provider to agree on which AC
   should be associated with the L3VPN in the provider network and the
   vDC in provider DC.  Then the provider and the customer will have to
   configure the mappings on CE(CGR) and PE manually or through an
   external device/system. Two providers also have to agree on the
   routing protocol for PE-CE and configure them properly at its PE and
   CE.

       Figure 2 L3VPN for Enterprise and Provider DC Interconnection

   Regarding the routing protocol for PE-CE, since the Site 3 is not
   controlled by the enterprise customer, it is natural for the
   customer wanting the network provider to provide route admission
   control and traffic filtering at the site for security reasons. For
   example, an enterprise customer may want the PE at Site 3 to perform
   VPN access control; only certain IP prefixes in the site are
   advertised to other PEs and the packet with certain source IP
   addresses can be forwarded to the VPN. This configuration can be
   done by either implementing a) BGP policy that limits eBGP routes
   accepted at the PE, or b) proxy aggregation at the PE, or c)
   insertion of static routes that summarize the data center routes.

Internet-Draft           VPN4DC Protocol Gap               October 2011


   Thus, the configurations at Enterprise sites and DC provider sites
   are very different; the routing protocol may be different as well.
   For example, use OSPF or iBGP for PE-CE routing at Enterprise sites
   and use eBGP at DC provider sites.

   Note 1: A network provider can construct a L3VPN for an enterprise
   with one intranet and some extranets today. However, the enterprise
   has to manage extranet security itself by using firewall devices.
   The traffic from an extranet access will be first routed to a
   particulate site where the enterprise has the firewall and then be
   routed within the intranet. [VPN4DC] requires that the applications
   running at the provider DC sites appear in the same way as if
   running in enterprise data center. This implies that the traffic
   from a Provider DC site does not go through the enterprise firewall.
   This requires the PE at site 3 perform the security access control
   for the Intranet.

   Note 2: Network provider L3VPN configuration has no assumption about
   DC network configuration. DC may also use VPNs to separate
   customers' traffic. DC VPN and Provider L3VPN are configured
   independently for an enterprise customer. Two VPNs are stitching
   together over PE-CGR interface. This document aims on this
   architecture. Other architectures are outside the scope of this
   analysis.

   L3VPN for this application is new and is facing some challenges as
   pointed out below.

5. Protocol Gap Analysis

   Section 3-4 review the necessary configurations and protocols of a
   L3VPN in IP/MPLS provider network for an enterprise customer, and a
   L3VPN extension to a DC provider site for connecting to vDC offered
   by DC provider. Such L3VPN provides routing and forwarding among
   attached CEs, which is the need for VPN4DC. However, we have
   identified at least the following VPN4DC requirements [VPN4DC] that
   current L3VPN protocols cannot support.

   o  [VPN4DC] requires a CGR to signal the adjacent PE for the PE to
      join a specific L3VPN in a provider network. This requires a DC
      provider and network provider have a common agreed key for a
      customer who buys a L3VPN and vDC. DC provider itself maintains
      the key to vDC mappings; network provider maintains the key to
      L3VPN ID mapping. CGR always uses the key to signal a request for
      a particular L3VPN. For the security reason, it is necessary to
      have a security ID associated with the key. [PROBLEM]

Internet-Draft           VPN4DC Protocol Gap               October 2011


   o  [VPN4DC] requires a CGR to signal a "host join" or "host leave"
      request to its adjacent PE for a set of host IDs (IP/MAC/VDC
      addresses) to attach to or be away from a particular L3VPN
      instance; and requires the network provider to authenticate the
      request prior to populate the relevant host reachability within
      the L3VPN. This implies that the PE performs route admission
      control at DC provider sites.

   o  [VPN4DC] requires a CGR to signal one or a set of point-to-point
      BW request for a particular L3VPN instance. This request is on-
      demand basis. The PE needs to allocate the BW on the LSP
      Tunnel(s) that associate to the L3VPN and are on the requested
      path upon receiving the request.

   o  [VPN4DC] requires a CGR to inform L3VPN PE about the connectivity
      within the DC network between PE and hosts.

   Multiple protocols apply to PE-CE for L3VPN routing learning. None
   of them is able to provide these capabilities.

6. Conclusion

   L3VPN can apply to the interconnection among enterprise sites and DC
   provider sites in supporting private cloud services. The key
   challenge is the configuration of the PE at Provider DC site. The
   document identifies several VPN4DC requirements that L3VPN protocols
   cannot support yet.

7. Security Considerations

   TBD.

8. IANA Considerations

   The document does not require any IANA action.
