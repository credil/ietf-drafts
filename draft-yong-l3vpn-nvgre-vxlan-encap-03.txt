Internet-Draft    NVGRE/VXLAN Extension for L3 Overlay     October 2013

Abstract

   Both NVGRE and VXLAN encapsulations were originally designed for L2
   overlay only. This draft proposes the enhancement on both to support
   L3 overlay as well. The proposed method completely decouples the L3
   overlay from the L2 overlay in terms of encoding schema and data
   processing.

Internet-Draft    NVGRE/VXLAN Extension for L3 Overlay     October 2013


1. Introduction

   Network Virtualization Overlay [NVO3FRWK] explicitly states that
   both L2 and L3 overlays are needed in practice. However both NVGRE
   encapsulation [NVGRE] and VXLAN encapsulation [VXLAN] were
   originally designed for L2 overlay only.

   This document proposes enhancements to NVGRE and VXLAN
   encapsulations to allow the same data encapsulation semantics for
   both L2 overlay and L3 overlay. The benefits of this approach are
   generalizing the data encapsulation semantics for overlay
   technologies, maintaining L3 overlay natively, and decoupling it
   from L2 overlay completely.


2. NVGRE Encapsulation Extension for L3 Overlay

   NVGER [NVGRE] leverages the GRE protocol [RFC2890] and specifies
   that the protocol type field in the GRE header MUST be filled with
   the value of 0x6558, which means for Transparent Ethernet.

   This document proposes the protocol type field to be filled with the
   value of 0x6558, 0x0800(IPv4), or 0x86dd(IPv6). The value of 0x0800
   and 0x86dd means that the payload is IP. The value 0x6558 MUST be
   used if the inner header is an Ethernet header. When NVGRE
   encapsulation is used for L3 overlay, it MUST use the value of
   0x0800 or 0x86dd in the protocol type field and MUST encode an IPv4
   or IPv6 header as the inner header. Other fields in the outer header
   and the GRE header remain the same.

   To support backward compatibility, when the remote tunnel end point
   only support the NVGRE described in [NVGRE], the tunnel end point
   that supports NVGRE described in this document MUST only encapsulate
   L2 packets. This capability can be either manually configured or be
   dynamically informed. How tunnel end points inform each other the
   encapsulation capabilities is beyond the scope of this document.
   Note that a tunnel may have more than two end points.

3. VXLAN Encapsulation Extension for L3 Overlay

   This document proposes adding a protocol type field in the VXLAN
   header as shown below. It takes 16 bits from the reserved 24 bits as
   the protocol type field. The remained 8 reserved bits MUST be filled
   with zero. For L2 overlay encapsulation, the protocol type field
   MUST be filled with the value of 0x6558 and inner header MUST be an
   Ethernet header. For L3 overlay encapsulation, the protocol type

   field MUST be filled with the value of 0x0800(IPv4) or 0x86dd(IPv6),
   and inner header MUST be an IPv4 or IPv6 header. Other fields in the
   outer header and VXLAN header remain the same.

      |                VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI) |   Reserved    |

     Inner Header:
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   To be backward compatible with the existing VXLAN encapsulation
   [VXLAN], the value 0x0000 in the Protocol Type field MUST be treated
   as Ethernet payload too. When the end points of a tunnel support
   different VXLAN formats, i.e. one, say A, supports old VXLAN format
   and another, say B, supports the new format described in this
   document, B MUST only encapsulate L2 packets and set value 0x0000 in
   the protocol type field. This capability can be either manually
   configured at B or be dynamically informed. How tunnel end points
   inform each other the encapsulation capabilities is beyond the scope
   of this document. Note that a tunnel may have more than two end
   points.

   Having protocol type field in the VXLAN header enables other overlay
   payload type beside L2 and L3 overlays. The application for other
   payload type is for future study.

4. Security Considerations

   The mechanism proposed in this document does not add any additional
   security concern beside what has been described in the NVGRE [NVGRE]
   and VXLAN [VXLAN].
