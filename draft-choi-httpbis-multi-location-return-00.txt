INTERNET DRAFT    Extension for Multi-location Return      July 15, 2013


1  Introduction

   For generic content delivery services, the high availability is a
   major issue as most contents provider wants more than 99%
   availability for their services. Response time is also a major issue
   as it might be the main reason why contents providers use CDN
   services.  However, due to limitation of redirection feature of
   HTTP/1.1, unnecessary connection cost and point of failures are
   expected on certain situation. 

   This document describes such situation and a suggestion for enhanced
   way to avoid those situation. 

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Current HTTP Redirection Procedure and Issues
   In this section, we describe an example of legacy HTTP-based
   redirection and problems it may have. 


      User agent                      Svr-www   Svr-www2   Svr-www3
      |                                  |          |          |
      |GET www.example.com/sample.zip HTTP/1.1      |          |(1)
      |--------------------------------->|          |          |
      |                                  |          |          |
      |302 www2.example.com/sample.zip HTTP/1.1     |          |(2)
      |<---------------------------------|          |          |
      |                                  |          |          |
      |GET www2.example.com/sample.zip HTTP/1.1     |          |(3)
      |-------------------------------------------->|          |
      |                                  |          |          |
      |200 OK HTTP/1.1                   |          |          |(4)
      |<--------------------------------------------|          |

   Figure 1: HTTP/1.1 based redirection example

   The above figure is an example of HTTP/1.1 based redirection with
   following steps:

   (1) Request sample.zip to www.example.com
   (2) Redirection to www2.example.com
   (3) Request sample.zip to www2.example.com

INTERNET DRAFT    Extension for Multi-location Return      July 15, 2013


   (4) Receive sample.zip from www2.example.com

   However, if www2 server went down or become unreachable during step
   (3), the user agent has nowhere else to request anything but just
   printing out error message to the end-user. Even though svr-www3 is
   ready to serve, there is no way to redirect the request of the user
   agent with legacy HTTP/1.1. Just after svr-www sends 302 message to
   the user agent, svr-www completely lose the control of this
   transaction.

   One of legacy solution for this problem is using L4 switch
   capability. However, when using L4 switch to avoid this problem, all
   of the servers needed to be in same network area, not to mention high
   price of L4 switches.

   Another legacy solution is DNS based GSLB(Global Server Load
   Balance).  DNS based GSLB can easily be deploied for the servers in
   different networks.  They are also less expensive than L4 switch
   solution (usually). Nevertheless, there are still problems. As it is
   based on DNS protocol, it cannot change the path of URL. Furthermore,
   even if GSLB monitors the status of servers, the problem still remain
   if a server goes down just right after the redirection. 

3.  HTTP Redirection with Multi-locations Return

   The following figure describes the situation that if HTTP supports
   multi-location return.

      User agent                      Svr-www   Svr-www2   Svr-www3
      |                                  |          |          |
      |GET www.example.com/sample.zip HTTP/2.0      |          |(1)
      |--------------------------------->|          |          |
      |                                  |          |          |
      |302 www2.example.com/sample.zip HTTP/2.0     |          |(2)
      |    www3.example.com/sample.zip HTTP/2.0     |          |
      |    www.example.com/sorry.html HTTP/2.0      |          |
      |<---------------------------------|          |          |
      |                                  |          |          |
      |GET www2.example.com/sample.zip HTTP/1.1     |          |(3)
      |-------------------------------------------->|          |
      |                                  |          |          |
      |connection fail                   |          |          |(4)
      |<--------------------------------------------|          |

INTERNET DRAFT    Extension for Multi-location Return      July 15, 2013


      |<-------------------------------------------------------|  
      | DATA                             |          |          |
   Figure 2: Example of HTTP-based Redirection with multi location
   return    

   The above figure is an example of HTTP/1.1 based redirection with
   following steps:

   (1) Request sample.zip to www.example.com
   (2) Provide redirection-url-list to user agent
   (3) Request sample.zip to www2.example.com
   (4) Connection to www2 failed
   (5) Retry to receive sample.zip from www3.example.com
   (6) Receive sample.zip from www3.example.com

   With this procedure, the user agent can try other URLs from the
   location list. The above step is just an example, and it can be
   expanded or developed with other ideas. Such as, like step (2) of
   figure 2, placing www server itself at the list, the user agent can
   come back to www server even if it fails to connect to every other
   servers.

4.  Backward Compatibility

   As there are so many clients that support HTTP/1.1 with single
   location return, it will take some time for them to upgrade with
   multi locations return capability. Thus we need to consider backward
   compatibility of this feature.

   The following is an example of using location tag  with HTTP/1.1 or
   older versions.

   HTTP/1.1 302
   Location: http://www.example.com/sample.zip

   Regarding the above example, rather than replacing a legacy location
   tag, just keeping the original location tag and adding an extension
   tag shall give backward compatibility to all types of clients. The
   example is as following:

   HTTP/2.0 302
   Location: http://www.example.com/sample.zip   
   M-Location: http://www.example.com/sample.zip
               http://www2.example.com/sample.zip
               http://www3.example.com/sample.zip
   M-Redirection-Count: 0

   In this way, legacy clients can parse the location tag as usual, and

   new client which supports the multiple location tag can utilize
   additional M-Location tag.  Note that M-Redirection-Count specifies
   the maximum number of allowed redirections.  It can be used to limit
   the number of redirection for protecting a redirection loop.

5.  Use Case


5.1. CDNi HTTP-based Redirection with Multi-location Return


   The following figure describes the situation that if HTTP supports
   the return of multiple locations in CDN interconnection
   environment[draft-choi-cdni-req-intf].  The details of CDN
   interconnection architecture and mechanisms are defined in the
   [draft-ietf-cdni-framework].  In this use case, we assume that the
   readers understand CDN interconnection mechanism. 

   The relevant steps are step 2 and 12.  In step 2, multiple request
   routing redirection CDN locations are returned upon the request
   routing redirection request by the end-user.  In step 12, it is
   applied in the case of content acquisition between CDN providers.
