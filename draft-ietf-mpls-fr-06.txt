This document defines the model and generic mechanisms for
Multiprotocol Label Switching on Frame Relay networks.  Furthermore,
it extends and clarifies portions of the Multiprotocol Label Switching
Architecture described in [ARCH] and the Label Distribution Protocol
(LDP) described in [LDP] relative to Frame Relay Networks.  MPLS
enables the use of Frame Relay Switches as Label Switching Routers
(LSRs).

This document is a product of the Multiprotocol Label Switching
Working Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.

This announcement is sent to the IETF list and the RFC-DIST list.
Requests to be added to or deleted from the IETF distribution list
