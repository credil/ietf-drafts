Internet-Draft          RTCP XR QoE Report Blocks          February 2012


1.  Introduction

1.1.  QoE Metrics Report Block

   This draft defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611], for use in a range of RTP applications.

   The new block type provides information on multimedia quality using
   one of several standard metrics.

   The metrics belong to the class of application level metrics defined
   in [MONARCH] (work in progress).

1.2.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]
   defined an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This draft defines a new Extended Report block that
   MUST be used as defined in RFC3550 and RFC3611.

1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework

   The Performance Metrics Framework [PMOL] provides guidance on the
   definition and specification of performance metrics.  Metrics
   described in this draft either reference external definitions or
   define metrics generally in accordance with the guidelines in [PMOL].

1.4.  Applicability

   The QoE Metrics Report Block can be used in any application of RTP
   for which QoE measurement algorithms are defined.

   The factors that affect real-time AV application quality can be split
   into two categories.  The first category consists of transport-
   dependent factors such as packet loss, delay and jitter (which also
   translates into losses in the playback buffer).  The factors in the
   second category are application-specific factors that affect real
   time application (e.g., video) quality and are sensitivity to network
   errors.  These factors can be but not limited to video codec and loss
   recovery technique, coding bit rate, packetization scheme, and
   content characteristics.

   Compared with application-specific factors, the transport-dependent
   factors sometimes are not sufficient to measure real time data
   quality, since the ability to analyze the real time data in the
   application layer provides quantifiable measurements for subscriber
   Quality of Experience (QoE) that may not be captured in the
   transmission layers or from the RTP layer down.  In a typical



Hunt, et al.             Expires August 5, 2012                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft          RTCP XR QoE Report Blocks          February 2012


   scenario, monitoring of the transmission layers can produce
   statistics suggesting that quality is not an issue, such as the fact
   that network jitter is not excessive.  However, problems may occur in
   the service layers leading to poor subscriber QoE.  Therefore
   monitoring using only network-level measurements may be insufficient
   when application layer content quality is required.

   In order to provide accurate measures of real time application
   quality when transporting real time contents across a network, the
   synthentical multimedia quality Metrics is highly required which can
   be conveyed in the RTCP XR packets[RFC3611] and may have the
   following three benefits:

   o  Tuning the content encoder algorithm to satisfy real time data
      quality requirements.
   o  Determining which system techniques to use in a given situation
      and when to switch from one technique to another as system
      parameters change.
   o  Verifying the continued correct operation of an existing system.


2.  Terminology

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The terminology used is

      Numeric formats S X:Y

         where S indicates a two's complement signed representation, X
         the number of bits prior to the decimal place and Y the number
         of bits after the decimal place.
         Hence 8:8 represents an unsigned number in the range 0.0 to
         255.996 with a granularity of 0.0039.  S7:8 would represent the
         range -127.996 to +127.996. 0:16 represents a proper binary
         fraction with range
         0.0 to 1 - 1/65536 = 0.9999847
         though note that use of flag values at the top of the numeric
         range slightly reduces this upper limit.  For example, if the
         16- bit values 0xfffe and 0xffff are used as flags for "over-
         range" and "unavailable" conditions, a 0:16 quantity has range
         0.0 to 1 - 3/65536 = 0.9999542

3.  QoE Metrics Block

   This block reports the multimedia application performance or quality
   beyond the information carried in the standard RTCP packet format.
   Information is recorded about multimedia application QoE metric which
   provides a measure that is indicative of the user's view of a
   service.  Multimedia application QoE metric is commonly expressed as
   a MOS ("Mean Opinion Score"), MOS is on a scale from 1 to 5, in which
   5 represents excellent and 1 represents unacceptable.  MOS scores are
   usually obtained using subjective testing or using objective
   algorithm.  However Subjective testing to estimate the multimedia
   quality may be not suitable for measuring the multimedia quality
   since the results may vary from test to test.  Therefore using
   objective algorithm to calculate MOS scores is recommended.  ITU-T
   recommendations define the methodologies for assessment of the
   performance of multimedia stream
   [G.107][P.564][G.1082][P.NAMS][P.NBAMS] and provides a method to
   evaluate QoE estimation algorithms and objective model for video and
   audio.  Hence this document recommends vendors and implementers to
   use these International Telecommunication Union (ITU)-specified
   methodologies to measure parameters when possible.


3.1.  Metric Block Structure

   The report block contents are dependent upon a series of flag bits
   carried in the first part of the header.  Not all parameters need to
   be reported in each block.  Flags indicate which are and which are
   not reported.  The fields corresponding to unreported parameters MUST
   be present, but are set to zero.  The receiver MUST ignore any QoE
   Metrics Block with a non-zero value in any field flagged as
   unreported.  The encoding of QoE metrics block payload consists of a
   series of 32 bit units called segments that describe MOS Type, MoS
   algorithm and MoS value.

   The QoE Metrics Block has the following format:

3.2.  Definition of Fields in QoE Metrics Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      The QoE Metrics Block is identified by the constant <SMQ>.

   Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bit

      This field is used to indicate whether the Basic Loss/Discard
      metrics are Interval or Cumulative metrics, that is, whether the
      reported values applies to the most recent measurement interval
      duration between successive metrics reports (I=01) (the Interval
      Duration) or to the accumulation period characteristic of
      cumulative measurements (I=00) (the Cumulative Duration) or to the
      value of a continuously measured or calculated that has been
      sampled at end of the interval (I=10) (Sampled Value).

   Rsd.:6 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Block Length: 16 bits

      The length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one.  For
      the QoE Metrics Block, the block length is variable length.

   SSRC of source: 32 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3611].

   Segment i: 32 bits

      There are three segment types : single stream per SSRC segment,
      multi-channel audio per SSRC segment, multi-layer per SSRC
      segment.  Multi-channel per SSRC segment and multi-layer per SSRC
      segment are used to deal with the case where multiple elementary
      streams or components are carried in one RTP stream while single
      stream per SSRC segment is used to deal with the case where there
      is no more than one elementary stream or component in one RTP
      stream.  The left two bits of the section determine its type.  If
      the leftmost bit of the segment is zero, then it is single stream
      segment.  If the leftmost bit is one and the second bit is zero,
      then it is multi-channel audio segment, if the leftmost bit is one
      and the second bit is one, then it is multi- view segment.  Note
      that in these three segment type,any two segment types can not be
      present in the same metric block.

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Segment Type ( S): 1 bit

      A zero identifies this as a single stream segment.  Single stream
      means there is only one elementary stream carried in one RTP
      stream.  The single stream segment can be used to report the MoS
      value associated with this elementary stream.  If there are
      multiple streams and they want to use the single stream segment to
      report the MOS value, they should be carried in the separate RTP
      streams with different SSRC.  In this case, multiple QoE Metrics
      Blocks are required to report the MOS value corresponding to each
      stream using single stream segment.

   Reserved (R): 1bit

      The bit in this field is reserved.  It MUST be set to zero and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver if the leftmost bit of Single
      Stream Per SSRC Segment is set to 0.

Internet-Draft          RTCP XR QoE Report Blocks          February 2012


   MoS Type (MT): 4 bits

      This field is used to indicate the MOS type to be reported.  The
      MOS type is defined as follows:

         0000 MOS-LQ - Listening Quality MoS.
         0001 MOS-CQ - Conversation Quality MoS.
         0010 MOS-A - Audio Quality MOS.
         0010 MOS-V - Video Quality MOS.
         0011 MOS-AV - Audio-Video Quality MOS.
         0100~1111 - Reserved for future definitions.

      MoS-LQ measures the quality of audio for listening purposes only
      while MoS-CQ measures the quality of audio for conversation
      purpose only.  MoS-A,MoS-V and MoS-AV measures the quality of
      audio application, the quality of video application and Audio-
      Video application respectively.  Both MoS-LQ and MoS-CQ are
      commonly used in VoIP applications.  MOS-LQ uses either wideband
      audio codec or narrowband audio codec, or both and does not take
      into account any of bidirectional effects, such as delay and echo.
      MOS-CQ uses narrowband codec and takes into account listening
      quality in each direction, as well as the bidirectional effects.
      G.107 and P.564 and ETSI TS101 329-5 specify three MoS algorithms
      that are used to estimate speech quality or conversation quality.
      P.NAMS and P.NBAMS specify two MoS algorithms that are used to
      estimate multimedia quality including video quality, audio quality
      and audio-video quality.  If MoS type is MoS-LQ and MoS-CQ, the
      MoS value can be calculated based on ITU-T G.107[G.107], ITU-T
      P.564 [P.564]or ETSI TS 101 329-5 [ETSI], if the Mos type is MoS-V
      or MoS-AV, the Mos value can be calculated based on ITU-T P.NAMS
      [P.NAMS]or ITU-T P.NBAMS [P.NBAMS].  If new MOS types are defined,
      they can be added by an update to this document.  If the receiver
      does not understand the MOS type defined in this document it
      should discard this report.  If MoS Type does not match the MoS
      algorithm in the report (e.g., specify a voice MOS algorithm for a
      video quality MOS), the receiver should also discard this report.

         101~111 - Reserved for future extension.

   Rsd.:7 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   MOS Value: 16 bits

      The estimated mean opinion score for multimedia application
      quality is defined as including the effects of delay,loss,
      discard,jitter and other effects that would affect multimedia
      quality .  It is expressed in numeric format 8:8 with the value in
      the range 0.0 to 255.996.  The valid the measured value ranges
      from 0.0 to 50.0, corresponding to MoS x 10 as for MoS.  If the
      measured value is over ranged, the value 0xFFFE SHOULD be reported
      to indicate an over-range measurement.  If the measurement is
      unavailable, the value 0xFFFF SHOULD be reported.  Values other
      than 0xFFFE,0xFFFF and the valid range defined above MUST NOT be
      sent and MUST be ignored by the receiving system.

      As defined in Section 3.2.1 of this document.  If the value of
      this field is not for MoS-V, the receiver using multi-layer
      segment should discard this invalid segment with the wrong MoS

   Calculation Algorithm (CALg):3 bits

         000~010 - Reserved.
         011 - ITU-T P.NAMS [P.NAMS] (Multimedia).
         100 - ITU-T P.NBAMS [P.NBAMS] (Multimedia).
         101~111 - Reserved for future extension.

   Sub Stream Identifier (SSID): 5 bits

      If multiple layers of video are carried in the same RTP stream,
      each layer will be viewed as a sub stream.  Specially, If multiple
      views of video are carried in the same RTP stream, each view will
      be viewed as a sub stream.  This field is used to identify each
      layer of video that is carried in the same media stream.  NAL unit
      type is one example of such SSID.

      (Editor's Note: It's not sufficient to simply say that a "NAL unit
      type is one example", the draft needs to give normative rules for
      the use of this field)

   Rsd.:2 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   MOS Value: 16 bits

      As defined in Section 3.2.1 of this document.


3.2.3.  Multi-Channel per SSRC Segment

   Segement Type ( S): 1 bit

      A one identifies this as either a multi-channel segment or multi-
      layer segment.

   Media Type (M): 1bit

      A zero identifies this as a multi-channel per SSRC segment.

   MoS Type (MT): 4 bits

      As defined in Section 3.2.1 of this document.  If the value of
      this field is not for MoS-CQ or MoS-LQ, the receiver using multi-
      channel segment should discard this invalid segment with the wrong
      MoS Type.

   Calculation Algorithm (CALg):3 bits

         000 - ITU-T P.564 Compliant Algorithm [P.564] (Voice)
         001 - G.107 [G.107] (Voice)
         010 - ETSI TS 101 329-5 Annex E, [ ETSI] (Voice)
         011~100 - Reserved.
         101~111 - Reserved for future extension.

   Channel Identifier (CHID): 4 bits

      This field is used to identify each channel that is carried in the
      same media stream.  If multiple channels of audio are carried in
      one RTP stream, each channel of audio will be viewed as a
      independent channel(e.g., left channel audio, right channel
      audio).  Channel mapping follows static ordering rule described in
      the section 4.1 of [RFC3551].

      (Editor's Note: It is not clear that the channel mapping in RFC
      3551 Section 4.1 is the only one in use)

   Rsd.:3 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   MOS Value: 16 bits

      As defined in Section 3.2.1 of this document.



4.  SDP Signaling

   One new parameter is defined for the report block defined in this
   document to be used with Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566]
   using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234].  It has the
   following syntax within the "rtcp-xr" attribute [RFC3611]:

   rtcp-xr-attrib =  "a=rtcp-xr:"
                     [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF
         xr-format = qoe-metrics
            qoe-metrics = "multimedia-quality-metrics"

   Refer to Section 5.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611] for a detailed description
   and the full syntax of the "rtcp-xr" attribute.


5.  IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.  For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to
   [RFC3611].

5.1.  New RTCP XR Block Type value

   This document assigns the block type value NDEL in the IANA "RTCP XR
   Block Type Registry" to the "QoE Metrics Block".

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace SMQ with the IANA provided RTCP
   XR block type for this block.]

5.2.  New RTCP XR SDP Parameter

   This document also registers a new parameter "qoe-metrics" in the
   "RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry".

5.3.  Contact information for registrations

   The contact information for the registrations is:

                    Qin Wu
                    sunseawq@huawei.com
                    101 Software Avenue, Yuhua District
                    Nanjing, JiangSu 210012 China

5.4.  New registry of calculation algorithms for single stream per SSRC
      segment

   This document creates a new registry for single stream per SSRC
   segment defined in the section 3.2.1 to be called "RTCP XR QoE metric
   block - multimedia application Calculation Algorithm" as a sub-
   registry of the "RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)
   Block Type Registry".  This registry applies to the multimedia
   session where each type of media are sent in a separate RTP stream.
   Specially this registry also applies to the layered video session
   where each layer video are sent in a separate RTP stream.  Policies

   for this new registry are as follows:

   o  The information required to support this assignment is an
      unambiguous definition of the new metric, covering the base
      measurements and how they are processed to generate the reported
      metric.  This should include the units of measurement, how values
      of the metric are reported in the one 16-bit fields "MoS Value".
   o  The review process for the registry is "Specification Required" as
      described in Section 4.1 of [RFC5226].
   o  Entries in the registry are integers.  The valid range is 0 to 7
      corresponding to the 3-bit field "CAlg" in the block.  Values are
      to be recorded in decimal.

   o  Initial assignments are as follows:

      1.  ITU-T P.564 Compliant Algorithm [P.564] (Voice)
      2.  G.107 [G.107] (Voice)
      3.  ETSI TS 101 329-5 Annex E [ ETSI] (Voice)
      4.  ITU-T P.NAMS [P.NAMS] (Multimedia)
      5.  ITU-T P.NBAMS [P.NBAMS] (Multimedia)


5.5.  New registry of calculation algorithms for multi-layer per SSRC
      segment

   This document creates a new registry for multi-layer per SSRC segment
   defined in the section 3.2.2 to be called "RTCP XR QoE metric block -
   layered application Calculation Algorithm" as a sub-registry of the
   "RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR) Block Type Registry"
   if multi-layer video are carried in the same RTP stream.  Policies
   for this new registry are as follows:

   o  The information required to support this assignment is an
      unambiguous definition of the new metric, covering the base
      measurements and how they are processed to generate the reported
      metric.  This should include the units of measurement, how values
      of the metric are reported in the one 16-bit fields "MoS Value".
   o  The review process for the registry is "Specification Required" as
      described in Section 4.1 of [RFC5226].
   o  Entries in the registry are integers.  The valid range is 0 to 7
      corresponding to the 3-bit field "CAlg" in the block.  Values are
      to be recorded in decimal.
   o  Initial assignments are as follows:

5.6.  New registry of calculation algorithms for multi-channel per SSRC
      segment

   This document creates a new registry for multi-channel per SSRC
   segment defined in the section 3.2.3 to be called "RTCP XR QoE metric
   block - multi-channel application Calculation Algorithm" as a sub-
   registry of the "RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)
   Block Type Registry" if multi-channel voice data are carried in the
   same RTP stream.  Policies for this new registry are as follows:

   o  The information required to support this assignment is an
      unambiguous definition of the new metric, covering the base
      measurements and how they are processed to generate the reported
      metric.  This should include the units of measurement, how values
      of the metric are reported in the one 16-bit fields "MoS Value".
