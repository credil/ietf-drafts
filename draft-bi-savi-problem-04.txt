             Problem Statement of SAVI Beyond the First Hop
                        draft-bi-savi-problem-04

Abstract

   IETF Source Address Validation Improvements (SAVI) working group is
   chartered for source address validation within the first hop from the
   end hosts, i.e. preventing a node from spoofing the IP source address
   of another node in the same IP link.  However, since SAVI requires
   the edge routers or switches to be upgraded, the deployment of SAVI
   will need a long time.  During this transition period, some source
   address validation techniques beyond the first hop (SAVI-BF) may be
   needed to complement SAVI and protect the networks from spoofing
   based attacks.  In this document, we first propose three desired
   features of the SAVI-BF techniques.  Then we analyze the problems of
   the current SAVI-BF technique, ingress filtering.  Finally, we
   discuss the directions that we can explore to improve SAVI-BF.

Internet-Draft        SAVI Problem Beyond First Hop        November 2012


1.  Introduction

   IETF Source Address Validation Improvements (SAVI) working group is
   chartered for source address validation within the first hop from the
   end hosts, i.e. preventing a node from spoofing the IP source address
   of another node in the same IP link.  However, since SAVI requires
   the edge routers or switches to be upgraded, the deployment of SAVI
   will need a long time.  During this transition period, some source
   address validation techniques beyond the first hop (SAVI-BF) may be
   needed to complement SAVI, so as to protect the networks from
   spoofing based attacks, which are prevalent DDoS attacks on the
   current Internet [Ground-Truth] [ARBOR-2010] [ARBOR-2009]
   [NANOG-Helpless].

   In this document, we first propose three desired features of SAVI-BF
   techniques.  The first desired feature is high deployment incentives,
   i.e. by deploying a technique, an ISP should significantly increase
   its ability to protect its network from spoofing based attacks.  The
   second one is low operational risks.  If a technique may improperly
   drop legitimate packets (so called false positive), it introduces new
   risks into the network operation and management.  It is desired that
   the false positive (FP) is as low as possible.  Third, low cost.  It
   is desired that the technique requires minimum investment and
   operational cost.

   We evaluate ingress filtering [BCP38] [BCP84], the best current
   practice in spoofing prevention, against these three features.
   Recent measurement shows that, the deployment of ingress filtering
   has not been improved over four years because the ISPs do not have
   incentive to deploy it [Efficacy], and sophisticated attackers
   exploit the spoofable networks to launch attacks.  We discuss the
   reasons why ingress filtering is still insufficiently applied by the
   ISPs despite that it has long been available in modern routers.

   Finally, we discuss the directions that we can explore to improve
   SAVI-BF.  We briefly survey two categories of SAVI-BF proposals, the
   path based techniques and the end-to-end based techniques.  We
   discuss their requirements, advantages and disadvantages.


2.  Desired Features of SAVI-BF Techniques

2.1.  High Deployment Incentives

   To motivate an ISP to deploy a technique, it is desirable that the
   technique can generate additional benefit for the ISP.  In terms of a
   SAVI-BF technique, it should provide the ISP with additional
   protection from spoofing based attacks.  Specifically, it should

Internet-Draft        SAVI Problem Beyond First Hop        November 2012


   significantly decrease the volume of the spoofing based attacks
   targeting the ISP, or the number of networks where these attacks can
   be successfully launched, or the number of source addresses or
   destination addresses that can be used in these attacks.

2.2.  Low Operational Risks

   If a technique may improperly drop legitimate packets, so called
   false positives (FP), it introduces new operational risks.
   Apparently, it is desired that the FP is as low as possible.  The
   higher the FP is, the more limited its application scope is.  For
   example, if the attack is not very severe, the network administrator
   won't apply a technique with high FP, since its operation risks may
   even surpass the loss caused by the attack.

2.3.  Low Cost

   It is desired that the technique requires minimum investment on the
   device and system upgrading.  It should also adapt to network
   dynamics rather than require manual intervention, which is costly,
   slow, and often the source of errors (misconfiguration).


3.  Problems of Ingress Filtering

   Ingress filtering is the best current practice for SAVI-BF.  Ingress
   filtering was proposed in 2000 [BCP38] , and updated in 2004 [BCP84].
   Ingress access lists (IALs) and unicast reverse path forwarding
   (uRPF) are two general ways to implement ingress filtering.  An IAL
   is a filter that checks the source address of every packet received
   on a network interface against a list of acceptable prefixes,
   dropping any packet that does not match the filter.  IALs are
   typically maintained manually.  Upon network dynamics (topology
   change or routing change), the IALs should be updated accordingly to
   avoid dropping legitimate packets. uRPF is an automated tool which
   can adapt with the network dynamics.  On the receipt of a packet,
   uRPF checks its source address against the forwarding table or
   routing table for validation. uRPF has four variants, strict RPF,
   feasible RPF, loose RPF and loose RPF ignoring default routes.
   Readers are referred to [BCP84] for the details of these variants.

   Today, many modern routers are capable of ingress filtering.  Many
   network administrators have turned on uRPF on their routers or been
   actively maintaining IALs to filter spoofing traffic.  The fraction
   of networks where spoofing is possible is significantly limited
   [MIT-Spoofer].  However, as shown by the recent measurement, the
   deployment of ingress filtering has not been improved over four
   years.  Sophisticated attackers can still exploit the networks where

Internet-Draft        SAVI Problem Beyond First Hop        November 2012


   spoofing is possible to launch spoofing based attacks, and IP
   spoofing remains a viable attack vector on the current Internet
   [Efficacy].

   In this section, we evaluate ingress filtering against the desired
   features, and analyze the reasons why ingress filtering is not
   sufficiently deployed, and why its deployment has not been improved
   over years.  We classify the five variants of ingress filtering (IAL
   and four variants of uRPF) into three categories according to their
   technical similarities, i.e.  IALs, strict/feasible RPF, and loose
   RPF* (including loose RPF and loose RPF ignoring default routes).
   The evaluation results are summarized in Table 1, which we will
   explain in detail in the following subsections.

             +---------------------+-----------+------+------+
             |      Techniques     | Incentive | Risk | Cost |
             +---------------------+-----------+------+------+
             |         IAL         |    low    |  low |  low |
             |          -          |           |      |      |
             | Strict/feasible RPF |    high   | high |  low |
             |          -          |           |      |      |
             |      Loose RPF*     |    low    |  low |  low |
             +---------------------+-----------+------+------+

                 Table 1: Evaluation of Ingress Filtering

3.1.  IAL

   In practice, IAL is typically applied near the source end, i.e. near
   the hosts who originate the traffic.  When applied at the destination
   end or intermediate nodes, the incoming direction of a source prefix
   is hard to determine.  Especially when the routing is dynamic,
   manually maintaining IALs is almost impossible.  As a result,
   deploying IAL (at the source end) is all about "being a good Internet
   citizen", but it provides very little self-protection to the ISPs
   [NANOG-Incentive].  Thus IAL has low deployment incentives.  If
   applied in relatively stable networks near the source end, manual
   configuration can be feasible, and won't cause high FP.  Thus the
   operational cost is also low.  IALs can be implemented using access
   control list (ACL), which is a common function in the modern routers.
   This lowers the cost of IAL.

3.2.  Strict/feasible RPF

   Strict and feasible RPF can adapt themselves to the routing dynamics
   and determine the incoming directions of source prefixes
   automatically.  They are more effective than IAL in detecting and
   filtering spoofing traffic, and thus provide higher deployment

   incentives to the ISPs.  However, they often drop legitimate packets
   under routing asymmetry, which is very prevalent with the existence
   of local routing policies, multi-homing and traffic engineering.
   This makes strict and feasible very risky [NANOG-Risk], and hence the
   operation needs to be very careful.  Feasible RPF has lower FP than
   strict RPF, since it can apply multiple interfaces as acceptable
   incoming directions for a source prefix.  But feasible RPF cannot
   avoid all FP in practice, since currently there is no practical way
   to generate and configure all possible incoming directions in the
   routers.  For example, in a link-state routing environment (IS-IS or
   OSPF), equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) [ECMP] is often used to generate
   the multiple acceptable incoming directions.  However, in practice,
   there can be many (tens of) ECMPs for a prefix, but the
   implementation of a router can only store several (e.g. 4 or 8) of
   them.  Thus the ECMPs for the prefix installed in the forwarding
   table may be different in different routers, which eventually causes
   the FP of feasible RPF.  And in BGP, the directions where BGP
   announcements for a source address prefix have been received can be
   considered as acceptable incoming directions [IDPF].  However, an ISP
   may choose not to announce a prefix via a path but still send traffic
   through it due to its local routing policy.  In this case, feasible
   RPF also causes FP.  The basic function of strict and feasible RPF is
   supported in most modern routers.  So deploying them doesn't require
   investment on upgrading devices.

3.3.  Loose RPF*

   Instead of validating the incoming direction of a source address,
   loose RPF* only checks the existence of the source address in the
   forwarding table.  Loose RPF* is only useful for filtering Martian
   addresses and unroutable addresses.  However, sophisticated attackers
   can evade loose RPF* checking by simply using routable source
   addresses.  Thus the incentive to deploy loose RPF is low.  On the
   other hand, its operational risk is also low.  Loose RPF* is also
   available in most modern routers, making it cheap to deploy.

   There are other reasons why the deployment of ingress filtering
   hasn't been improved in four years.  First, although most modern
   routers are capable of ingress filtering, some legacy routers are
   incapable [NANOG-Equipment].  Hence, even at the locations where no
   risk exists (e.g. stub or single-homed networks), ingress filtering
   may not be applied.  Another reason is called inertia.  Since ingress
   filtering is not enabled on routers by default, some network
   administrators just won't bother to turn it on
   [NANOG-PowerOfDefaults].

4.  Discussion

   In this section, we discuss the directions that we can explore to
   improve SAVI-BF.  We briefly survey two categories of SAVI-BF
   proposals, the path based techniques and the end-to-end based
   techniques.  We discuss their requirements, advantages and
   disadvantages.  We only focus on the techniques that are implemented
   on the routers.  The techniques implemented on end hosts, such as
   [IPSec], [HCF] and [IP-Puzzles], are not covered here.

4.1.  Path based Techniques

   The path based techniques essentially require that a router R knows
   the forwarding paths that each source prefix S uses toward its
   destinations, and subsequently knows the incoming directions/
   interfaces of S. Sometimes, this information is available to R. For
   example, in a pure link-state routing protocol environment (e.g.
   IS-IS, OSPF), all nodes have the same view of the network.  Thus, R
   can compute the paths from S to all destinations, and then infer the
   incoming directions of S. One exception is that, when there are
   multiple equally best paths, R may not determine which one S will
   use.  On the other hand, if a distance-vector (e.g.  RIP) or a path-
   vector (BGP) routing protocol is used, it is even harder for R to
   determine the paths of S, since the sufficient routing information is
   missed.  [SAVE] and [IDPF] are tow proposals which validate source
   addresses by inferring their forwarding paths.

4.2.  End-to-end based Techniques

   There are, however, other proposals that don't rely on path
   information.  We call them end-to-end based techniques.  For example,
   [SPM] associates each source prefix (indeed, source AS number) with a
   key.  S, an SPM-enabled AS, will tag the key into outbound packets
   toward R at its border routers.  And R verifies the keys of the
   inbound packets whose source addresses belong to S at its border
   routers.  The routers will drop a packet if the key is incorrect.
   Thus, R manages to validate the source addresses of S without knowing
   its forwarding paths.  The end-to-end based the techniques typically
   need the cooperation between the source and the verification nodes,
   and require particular tags be carried in the data packets.  Further
   more, even the end-to-end based techniques require to distinguish
   inbound traffic and outbound traffic, which is not completely path-
   independent.

4.3.  Non-technical Proposals

   There are also proposals which formulate source address validation as
   an economic problem [FaaS], or suggest that laws and governance

   should be enforced.  These directions, however, may be out of the
   scope of IETF.
