            Avoidance of Security Issues in SIP and Internet
           draft-srivastava-dispatch-avoidance-of-threats-00

Abstract

   This memo lists the security issues not addressed by SIPS and other
   drafts in progress.  It provides two solutions to it.  First solution
   calls for fixing issues one by one.  The second solution avoids the
   security issues altogether.  It has potential to obviate the need of
   'Security Consideration' section from IETF documents.  It requires
   wider acceptance from the community.  Author is requesting IETF
   community to voice it's opinion and share the second solution with
   non-IETF members also to have their opinion.

Internet-Draft            Avoidance of Threats                  Oct 2011


1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] and indicate
   requirement levels for compliant mechanisms.


2.  Problem Statement

   SIPS [RFC5630] by amending SIP [RFC3261] and
   draft-jennings-sip-dtls-05 [I-D.jennings-sip-dtls] leaves following
   encryption related issues unaddressed:

2.1.  Encryption Issues

   o 1 SIP network is used to transport other URI schemes (e.g tel, im,
   pres).  SIPS tells security about SIP URI but others are not
   addressed.  In future, we might use SIP network to transport other
   URI also.  SIPS for SIP, telS for tel etc is unmodular solution.
   Moreover SIPS kind of solution doubles the entries in registrar and
   DNS.

   o 2 SIPS [RFC5630] underspecifies the feature control. e.g.  It meant
   that the proper authorization is needed to replace secure dialog by
   unsecure etc.  Dialog identifier is call-id, to-tag, from-tag.  It
   doesn't contain secure/unsecure (security-level) information.

   o 3 SIPS [RFC5630] uses "tls" in via header and it hides whether TCP
   or SCTP is used.  Whereas draft-jennings-sip-dtls-05
   [I-D.jennings-sip-dtls] differentiates between DTLS over UDP and
   DCCP.  These solutions do not take into account existence of IPSEC
   tunnels between SIP addressable entities (IMS CSCF).  In this case,
   SIPS in its current form causes encryption to happen at two layers.
   Transport and Secure protocol should be completely disjoint for
   future extensability.

   o 4 Secure protcol is one variant.  Different cipher-suites are
   supported by different secure protocols.  Based on the usage scenario
   different levels of security techniques are needed.  US DOD considers
   AES256 as top secret, whereas a small shop owner in downtown might
   consider using DES, to avoid heavy resource requirement of AES256.
   Moreover as the computing/networking technologies (parallelism etc)
   advances and these resources become cheaper in future, breaking of
   existing cipher-suites cannot be ruled out.  Need of the development
   of different cipher-suites in the past can be used as an indication
   for this trend.  Cipher-suites are not exposed in SIP.  An
   application cannot enforce AES256 at every SIP hop in the current

   specification.  Degradation of cipher-suites is very much possible.

   o 5 SIPS [RFC5630] has modified the text to fix the issues of
   retargeting, last hop exception arising out of SIP [RFC3261].  Yet it
   is hard for implementors to understand it and cover each use case due
   to complexity of it.

   In summary secure routing and secure reachability are two different
   requirements which are bundled together with resource property namely
   SIPS URI scheme.  The hop by hop nature of SIP makes it hard to
   understand what needs to be done where.  SIP is not like HTTP.  There
   is very thick line between resource and routing.  Therefore we have
   been witnessing issues in understanding of the problem itself.

2.2.  Non-Encryption Issues

   The above deals in encryption / integrity of SIP messages at the
   hops.  The above doesn't deal in other possible security issues such
   as call pattern tracking (There is still possibility of an
   organization to know about which research department of competitor is
   talking to patent lawyers to know about the stealth projects/area of
   research), Denial of service attacks, identity theft, spam etc.
   There is still possibility of misuse of any confidential information
   of customer/vendor etc by word of mouth by the entity keeping that
   information to potential competitors or gang of cheaters.  Refer
   details of other unfair scenarios in different articles on The
   Dreamer [1]


3.  Proposed Solutions

3.1.  Detecting And Fixing

   Encryption related issues pertaining to SIP can be handled with the
   proposed solution in draft-srivastava-sip-e2e-ciphersuites-00
   [I-D.srivastava-sip-e2e-ciphersuites] with a separate header
   describing secure protocols, cipher-suites; and tags for Proxy-
   Require and Require header.  This solution addresses the issues
   described in Section 2.1.

   Denial of Service Attack, Call Pattern Tracking, spam etc issues have
   been always in N+1 cycle of detecting and solving.  The current
   solutions donot address these by avoidance.

   As the vote is being sought for much bigger solution as described
   below, the solution of draft-srivastava-sip-e2e-ciphersuites-00
   [I-D.srivastava-sip-e2e-ciphersuites] is not described in details
   here.

3.2.  Avoidance Of Threats

   Refer information pertaining to Cashless Economy on The Dreamer [1] .
   Cashless Economy is achieved via Complete Digital World i.e. every
   person/entity involving business transactions has computing device(s)
   to do business transactions.  In Complete Digital World, the common
   denominator of valuation is handled ONLY in computing devices,
   henceforth it is called as Soft Earning Unit (SEU).  Cashless Economy
   provides end-to-end traceability to earnings/spendings.  Linkage of
   communication records with earnings /spendings can catch the spammer
   always.  Therefore traceability of SEU avoids this problem.  Heavy
   encryption is not needed for deals resulting in direct transactions
   in money.  Encryption will be needed for privacy sensitive
   information exchange such as stealth projects, defence mattters etc.
   Financial information pertaining to earnings/spendings can be
   exchanged with NULL encryption ciphers.  Cashless economy avoids
   other non-internet related problems (such as terrorism, illegally
   printed currency bills, bribery etc) due to parallel economy of bad
   guys.  Conversely, it is the application which will eliminate the
   digital /communication divide (which we have been talking for a
   long).

   Refer information pertaining to Complete Multimedia Recording on The
   Dreamer [1] .  The current work carried out in SIP Recording (siprec)
   group deals in solutions for session recordings.  Complete Multimedia
   Recording captures audio and video across time and space dimensions,
   even if there is no active session.  In the proposed solution
   computing devices will capture the recordings of the walled space and
   satellites will capture recordings of open space.  As everything is
   captured, whenever an attacker tries to intrude, (s)he will be caught
   somewhere in the recordings.  As persons performing bad/illegal
   activities will be caught somewhere and as evidences cannot be
   manipulated (manipulation will be caught somewhere too), bad
   activities will not happen.  It will avoid the issues like man-in-
   middle attack, denial of service attacks, identity theft, hacking of
   hosted email ids, online service providers games under the cover of
   hackers.  This will obviate the need of complex encryption and
   integrity protection mechanism of messages.  In the Complete
   Multimedia Recording environment, we will need bare minimum checksums
   for catching malfunctioning of computing resources.  It will obviate
   the need of 'Security Consideration' section of the IETF documents.
   Apart from fixing security related issues for internet, it avoids the
   need of complex laws, misuse of any technology, miuse of any
   confidential traceability information via word of mouth etc.

   Due to wide spread usage of unfair business practices even by top
   leaders, it has not been possible to find starting point of the
   change.  Everybody complains about it, but nobody wants to take lead.

   As they argue that why they should be deprived; others should stop
   first.  The proposed migration plan of Cashless Economy and Complete
   Multimedia Recording brings out a important silent point that things
   will be changed at a SINGLE point of time.  So the big chunk of
   people who WANT to be fair and honest, will become advocate of the
   proposed change.  Moreover everyone understands very well the
   difference between fair/unfair actions before commiting any unfair
   actions.

3.3.  Future Work

   Author is humbly requesting the community to vote/voice their opinion
   for the alternatives described above.  Either we end up fixing the
   security issues with N+1 cycle (solution of Section 3.1 ) as we have
   been doing till now, or take a route to avoid the security issues via
   proposed solutions in Section 3.2.  Any opinion/flame even via
   annonymously is welcome.


4.  Security Considerations

   This memo deals in Security Issues for SIP.  It proposes two
   solutions.  The solution of avoidance of threats applies to internet
   also.  That solution has potential to obviate the need of this
   section from IETF documents in future.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.


6.  IPR Consideration

   Author is pursuing published patent applications PCT/US2008/066617,
