                          OmniBroker Protocol
                    draft-hallambaker-omnibroker-04

Abstract

   An Omnibroker is an agent chosen and trusted by an Internet user to
   provide information such as name and certificate status information
   that are in general trusted even if they are not trustworthy.  Rather
   than acting as a mere conduit for information provided by existing
   services, an Omnibroker is responsible for curating those sources to
   protect the user.

   The Omnibroker Protocol (OBP) provides an aggregated interface to
   trusted Internet services including DNS, OCSP and various forms of
   authentication service.  Multiple transport bindings are supported to
   permit efficient access in virtually every common deployment scenario
   and ensure access in any deployment scenario in which access is not
   being purposely denied.

1.  Definitions

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Purpose

   Today, a network client is required to make queries against multiple
   information sources to establish a secure connection to a network
   resource.  A DNS query is required to translate network names to
   Internet addresses.  If TLS transport is used, an OSCP query may be
   required to validate the server certificate.  Support for client
   authentication may require interaction with another service.

   Servers require similar support when accepting Internet connections.
   Even though most networking infrastructure supports some form of
   network administration, it is left to the network administrator to
   fill in the gap between server applications and network
   infrastructure.  Making use of such facilities is rarely cost
   effective except at the very largest installations.

   An Omnibroker is a trusted agent that acts as a single point of
   service for client queries requesting a connection to a named network
   resource and server advertisements accepting connections to a named
   network resource.

2.1.  Omnibroker Implementation

   Omnibroker is implemented as a JSON/REST Web service using Jason
   Connect (JCX) to establish and manage the long term trust
   relationship with the Omnibroker provider.

2.1.1.  Establishing service

   In normal use, an omnibroker client receives service from a single
   Omnibroker service provider.  For performance and reliability
   reasons, an Omnibroker service provider is expected to provide
   multiple Omnibroker service instances.

   An Omnibroker client acquires the network address information and
   credentials necessary to access an omnibroker service using the JCX
   Web Service to establish a connection binding.  To ensure reliabilty
   and the ability to access the service in all circumstances, an
   Omnibroker connection binding SHOULD specify multiple service
   instances.

2.1.2.  Protocol Bindings

   Due to the need for low latency and the need to function in a
   compromised network environment, three protocol bindings are defined:

      A HTTP binding using HTTP [RFC2616] for session layer framing and
      HTTP Session Continuation [I-D.hallambaker-httpsession] for
      message authentication and JSON encoding [RFC4627] of protocol
      messages.

      A UDP Binding using JSON-B [I-D.hallambaker-jsonbcd]for framing
      and encoding of protocol messages.

      A DNS Binding using DNS [RFC4627] TXT record queries with Base32
      and Base64 encoding for transport and framing and JSON-B for
      encoding of protocol messages.

Internet-Draft             OmniBroker Protocol                 June 2013


   The implementation overhead of support for three different protocol
   bindings is reduced by the choice of a binary encoding for JSON
   (JSON-B) that is very close in structure to JSON encoding allowing
   encoders and decoders to support both encodings with minimal
   additional code.

   Regardless of the protocol binding used, all Omnibroker messages are
   authenticated with protection against replay attack under the
   cryptographic credentials established in the connection binding
   service instance.

2.2.  Omnibroker Query Service

   Directing queries through a single point of contact has performance,
   relability and security advantages.  Directing queries to multiple
   network information sources degrades performance and may cause a
   connection request to fail if an information resource is not
   available.  This has led many application providers to limit the
   information sources they consult.  Directing queries through an
   Omnibroker allows as many information sources to be brought to bear
   as the broker has local cached data for without loss of performance
   or reliability.

   Making use of additional data sources allows the broker to 'curate'
   the response.  If the broker knows that a Web site always returns a
   redirect to a TLS secured version of the same site, it can tell a Web
   Browser to go straight to the secure version.  If a Web Server is
   hosted on a known botnet, the Omnibroker can tell the client that it
   really does not want to visit that location.

   Unlike the traditional DNS configuration, an Ombinbroker client
   decides which source(s) of trusted information to use rather than
   relying on whatever happens to be the nearest source to hand.

   The traditional DNS approach creates an obvious security risk as DNS
   is a trusted service and deciding to choose a random DNS service
   advertised by the local DHCP service is clearly a poor decision
   process for a trusted service.

2.3.  Omnibroker Advertisement Service

   Directing service advertisements to a single point of contact has
   similar benefits.  The single point of contact can take
   responsibility for managing load balancing.  Firewall and router
   configurations can be set automatically.  Anti-abuse technologies
   such as IP address filters and rate limiting devices can be switched
   in as required.

   In simple network configurations such as a residential

2.4.  Walled Gardens

   IETF culture has traditionally resisted attempts to establish
   partitions within the open Internet with restricted access to network
   resources or compromised security.  Such 'Walled Gardens' models
   typically exist for the benefits of those who own the walls rather
   than those forced to live inside them.

   While virtually all residential Internet users reject such controls,
   most find them acceptable, if not desirable in workplaces and
   schools.

   Omnibroker simplifies the process of establishing such a walled
   garden but does not make the walls any easier to defend.

2.4.1.  Censorship

   From a censorship point of view, the censorship concerns of running
   an Omnibroker are essentially the same as those of running a DNS
   service.  The party who decides which discovery service to use can
   determine which content is visible to the users.

2.4.2.  Trust Substitution

   Like SCVP [RFC5055] and XKMS [TBS] , Omnibroker permits an Internet
   client to delegate some or all aspects of PKIX [RFC5280] certificate
   path chain discovery and validation.

   In the normal mode of operation, the Omnibroker service performs only
   path chain discovery, leaving the client to re-check the PKIX
   certificate path before relying on it.  This gives the Omnibroker the
   power to veto a client connection to a server that it considers to be
   unsafe but not the power to tell the client to trust a site of its
   own choosing.

   This ability to veto but not assert trust is appropriate and
   sufficient for the vast majority of network applications.  It allows
   the broker to make use of additional path validation checks that are
   not supported in the client such as DANE [RFC6698] or Certificate
   Transparency [RFC6962].

   There are however some workplace environments where the ability to
   access external network resources with strong encryption is not
   permissible by enterprise policy or in some cases by law.  An
   intelligence analyst working at the NSA may have a need to access
   external Web sites that contain important information but must on no

   account have access to a covert channel that could be used to
   exfiltrate information.  Certain Financial institutions with access
   to valuable commercial information are required to monitor and record
   all communications into and out of the company to deter insider
   trading.

   The traditional response to such needs has been to tell the parties
   affected to look elsewhere for support.  As a consequence the
   techniques used to satisfy such requirements are generally unfriendly
   to network applications in general and have in some cases put the
   public Web PKI trust infratructure at risk.

   There is an argument to be made that rather than attempting to
   prohibit such activities entirely, it would be better to provide a
   principled method of achieving those ends and for mainstream software
   providers to support it in such a fashion that ensures that network
   applications configured for that mode of use can be readilly
   identified as such by end users.

2.4.3.  Censorship Bypass

   As the preceeding examples demonstrate, a party with control over the
   Omnibroker service chosen by a user has full control over the network
   activities of that user.  An important corrolary of this fact is that
   all a user need do to achieve full control over their network
   activities is to run their own Omnibroker service and connect to
   that.

   For example such an Omnibroker service might be configured to return
   connection data for permitted domestic Web sites as normal but direct
   attempts to connect to forbidden foreign news or social media through
   a privacy network such as TOR.

   The OBP service connection broker answers the query 'what connection
   parameters should be used to establish the best connection to
   interract with party X according to protocol Y. Where 'best' is
   determined by the Omnibroker which MAY take into account parameters
   specified by the relying party.

3.1.1.  Service Connection Broker

   The OBP service connection broker supports and extends the
   traditional DNS resolution service that resolves a DNS name (e.g.
   www.example.com) to return an IP address (e.g. 10.1.2.3).

   When using an Omnibroker as a service connection broker, a client
   specifies both the DNS name (e.g. www.example.com) and the Internet
   protocol to be used (e.g. _http._tcp).  The returned connection
   parameters MAY include:

      The IP protocol version, address and port number to establish a
      connection to.

      If appropriate, a security transport such as TLS or IPSEC.

      If appropriate, a description of a service credential such as a
      TLS certificate or a constraint on the type of certificates that
      the client should consider acceptable.

      If appropriate, application protocol details such as version and
      protocol options.

   If an attempt to connect with the parameters specified fails, a
   client MAY report the failure and request a new set of parameters.

3.1.1.1.  Service Connection Broker Example

   Alice uses her Web browser to access the URL http://www.example.com/.
   The Web browser sends a QueryConnectRequest request to obtain the
   best connection parameters for the http protocol at www.example.com:

   The service responds with an ordered list of possible connections.
   In this case the site is accessible via plain TCP transport or with
   TLS.  Since TLS is the preferred protocol, that connection is listed
   first.

           "ProtocolPolicy": "Strict"}]}}


3.1.2.  Peer Connection Broker

   Each OBP request identifies both the account under which the request
   is made and the device from which it is made.  An OBP broker is thus
   capable of acting as a peer connection broker service or providing a
   gateway to such a service.

   When using Omnibroker as a peer connection broker, a client specifies
   the account name and DNS name of the party with which a connection is
   to be established (e.g. alice@example.com) and the connection
   protocol to be used (e.g. _xmpp-client._tcp)

   The returned connection parameters are similar to those returned in
   response to a service broker query.

3.1.2.1.  Service Connection Broker Example

   Although the QueryConnectResponse returned the hash of a PKIX
   certificate considered valid for that connection, the server returns
   a different certificate which the client verifies using the
   ValidateRequest query.

3.1.3.  Credential Validation

   The credential validation query provides certificate path validation
   and status checking.

   The service provided by OBP is similar to that provided by OCSP and
   SCVP.  Like SCVP, OBP is an agent selected by the relying party to
   validate certificates and/or construct trust paths on its behalf.

3.2.  Service Advertisement

   Service advertisement is the converse of service resolution.  An
   Internet application wishing to accept inbound connections specifies
   one or more sets of connection parameters for the Omnibroker to
   register with whatever naming, discovery or other services may be
   appropriate.

         The requested password.

5.  Transport Bindings

   To achieve an optimal balance of efficiency and availability, three
   transport bindings are defined:

      Supports all forms of OBP transaction in all network environments.

      Provides efficient support for a subset of OBP query transactions
      that is accessible in most network environments.

      Provides efficient support for all OBP query transactions and is
      accessible in most network environments.

   Support for the HTTP over TLS binding is REQUIRED.

   An OBP message consists of three parts:

   Ticket [As necessary]  If specified, identifies the cryptographic key
      and algorithm parameters to be used to secure the message payload.

   Payload [Required]  If the ticket context does not specify use of an
      encryption algorithm, contains the message data.  Otherwise
      contains the message data encrypted under the encryption algorithm
      and key specified in the ticket context.

   Authenticator [Optional]  If the ticket context specifies use of a
      Message Authentication Code (MAC), contains the MAC value
      calculated over the payload data using the authentication key
      bound to the ticket.

   Note that although each of the transport bindings defined in this
   specification entail the use of a JSON encoding for the message data,
   this is not a necessary requirement for a transport binding.

5.1.  HTTP over TLS

   OBP requests and responses are mapped to HTTP POST requests and
   responses respectively.  Java Script Object Notation (JSON) encoding
   is used to encode requests and responses.

5.1.1.  Message Encapsulation

   Requests and responses are mapped to HTTP POST transactions.  The
   content of the HTTP message is the message payload.  The Content-Type
   MUST be specified as application/json.  The Character set MUST be
   specified as UTF-8.

Internet-Draft             OmniBroker Protocol                 June 2013


   The Ticket and Authenticator are specified using the Integrity header
   as follows:

   Session: <base64 (authenticator)> ; ticket=<base64 (ticket)>

5.1.2.  Example

   [To be generated from spec]

5.2.  DNS Tunnel

   The DNS Tunnel mode of operation makes use of DNS TXT resource record
   requests and responses to tunnel OBP Query requests.  Due to the
   constraints of this particular mode of operation, use of this
   transport is in practice limited to supporting transactions that can
   be expressed within 500 bytes.  These include the QueryConnect and
   ValidateRequest interactions.

5.2.1.  Request

   Requests are mapped to DNS TXT queries.  The request is mapped onto
   the DNS name portion of the query by encoding the Ticket,
   Authenticator and JSON encoded Payload using Base32 encoding and
   appending the result to the service prefix to create a DNS name as
   follows:

   <base32(payload)>.<base32(authenticator)>.<base32(ticket)>.Suffix

   The payload MAY be split across multiple DNS labels at any point.

5.2.2.  Response

   Responses are mapped to DNS TXT records by encoding the Authenticator
   and JSON encoded Payload using Base64 encoding and cocatenating the
   result with a periods as a separator as follows:

   <base32(payload)>.<base32(authenticator)>

5.2.3.  Example

   [To be generated from spec]

5.3.  UDP

   The UDP transport MAY be used for transactions where the request fits
   into a single UDP packet and the response can be accomadated in 16
   UDP packets.  As with the Web Service Binding, Java Script Object
   Notation (JSON) encoding is used to encode requests and responses.

5.3.1.  Request

   The request consists of four message segments containing a Header,
   Ticket, Payload and Authenticator.  Each message segment begins with
   a two byte field that specified the length of the following data
   segment in network byte order.  The Payload is encoded in JSON
   encoding and the remaining fields as binary data without additional
   encoding.

   The header field for this version of the protocol (1.0) contains two
   bytes that specify the Major and Minor version number of the
   transport protocol being 1 and 0 respectively.  Future versions of
   the transport protocol MAY specify additional data fields.

   [TBS diagram]

5.3.2.  Response

   The response consists of a sequence of packets.  Each packet consists
   of a header section and a data section.

   The header section consists of a two byte length field followed by
   two bytes that speciofy the Major and Minor version number of the
   transport protocol (1 and 0), two bytes that specify the frame number
   and the total number of frames and two bytes that specify the message
   identifier.

   [Question, should the authenticator be over the whole message or
   should each packet have its own authenticator?]

8.  To do

      The specification should define and use a JSON security object.

      Formatting of the abstract data items needs to be improved

      Need to specify the UDP transport binding

      Should specify how each data item is represented in JSON format
      somewhere.  This is obvious for some of the data types but needs
      to be fully specified for things like DateTime.

      Run the code to produce proper examples.

      Write an API document
