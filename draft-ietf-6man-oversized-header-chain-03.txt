              Implications of Oversized IPv6 Header Chains
               draft-ietf-6man-oversized-header-chain-03

Abstract

   The IPv6 specification allows IPv6 header chains of an arbitrary
   size.  The specification also allows options which can in turn extend
   each of the headers.  In those scenarios in which the IPv6 header
   chain or options are unusually long and packets are fragmented, or
   scenarios in which the fragment size is very small, the first
   fragment of a packet may fail to include the entire IPv6 header
   chain.  This document discusses the interoperability and security
   problems of such traffic, and updates RFC 2460 such that the first
   fragment of a packet is required to contain the entire IPv6 header
   chain.

Internet-Draft   Implications of Oversized Header Chains       July 2013


1.  Introduction

   With IPv6, optional internet-layer information is carried in one or
   more IPv6 Extension Headers [RFC2460].  Extension headers are placed
   between the IPv6 header and the upper-layer header in a packet.  The
   term "header chain" refers collectively to the IPv6 header, extension
   headers and upper-layer header occurring in a packet.  In those
   scenarios in which the IPv6 header chain is unusually long and
   packets are fragmented, or scenarios in which the fragment size is
   very small, the header chain may span multiple fragments.

   While IPv4 had a fixed maximum length for the set of all IPv4 options
   present in a single IPv4 packet, IPv6 does not have any equivalent
   maximum limit at present.  This document updates the set of IPv6
   specifications to create an overall limit on the size of the
   combination of IPv6 options and IPv6 Extension Headers that is
   allowed in a single IPv6 packet.  Namely, it updates RFC 2460 such
   that the first fragment of a fragmented datagram is required to
   contain the entire IPv6 header chain.

   It should be noted that this requirement does not preclude the use of
   e.g.  IPv6 jumbo payloads but instead merely requires that all
   *headers*, starting from IPv6 base header and continuing up to the
   upper layer header (e.g.  TCP or the like) be present in the first
   fragment.

3.  Terminology

   Extension Header:

      Extension Headers are defined in Section 4 of [RFC2460].
      Currently, six extension header types are defined.  [RFC2460]
      defines the hop-by-hop, routing, fragment and destination options
      extension header types.  [RFC4302] defines the authentication
      header type and [RFC4303] defines the encapsulating security
      payload (ESP) header type.

   First Fragment:

      An IPv6 fragment with fragment offset equal to 0.

   IPv6 Header Chain:

      The initial portion of an IPv6 datagram containing headers,
      starting from the fixed IPv6 header up to (and including) the
      upper layer protocol header (TCP, UDP, etc. -- assuming there is
      one of those), including any intermediate IPv6 extension headers.
      For a header to qualify as a member of the header chain, it must
      be referenced by the "Next Header" field of the previous member of
      the header chain.

   Upper-layer Header:

      The first member of the header chain that is neither an IPv6
      header nor an IPv6 extension header.  For the purposes of this
      document, ICMPv6 is considered to be an upper-layer protocol, even
      though ICMPv6 operates at the same layer as IPv6.  Also for the
      purposes of this document, the first 32 bits of the ICMPv6 message
      (i.e., the type, code fields and checksum fields) are considered
      to be the ICMPv6 header.

      NOTES:
         The upper-layer payload is not part of the upper-layer header
         and therefore, is not part of the IPv6 header chain.  For
         example, if the upper-layer protocol is TCP, the TCP payload is
         not part of the TCP header or the IPv6 header chain.

         When a packet contains an ESP header [RFC4303], such header is
         considered to be the last header in the IPv6 header chain.  For
         the sake of clarity, we note that only the Security Parameters
         Index (SPI) and the Sequence Number fields (i.e., the first 64
         bits of the ESP packet) are part of the ESP header (i.e., the
         Payload Data and trailer are NOT part of the ESP header).

4.  Motivation

   Many forwarding devices implement stateless firewalls.  A stateless
   firewall enforces a forwarding policy on packet-by-packet basis.  In
   order to enforce its forwarding policy, the stateless firewall may
   need to glean information from both the IPv6 and upper-layer headers.

   For example, assume that a stateless firewall discards all traffic
   received from an interface unless it destined for a particular TCP
   port on a particular IPv6 address.  When this firewall is presented
   with a fragmented packet, and the entire header chain is contained
   within the first fragment, the firewall discards the first fragment
   and allows subsequent fragments to pass.  Because the first fragment
   was discarded, the packet cannot be reassembled at the destination.
   Insomuch as the packet cannot be reassembled, the forwarding policy
   is enforced.

   However, when the firewall is presented with a fragmented packet and
   the header chain spans multiple fragments, the first fragment does
   not contain enough information for the firewall to enforce its
   forwarding policy.  Lacking sufficient information, the stateless
   firewall either forwards or discards that fragment.  Regardless of
   the action that it takes, it may fail to enforce its forwarding
   policy.

5.  Updates to RFC 2460

   When a host fragments a IPv6 datagram, it MUST include the entire
   header chain in the first fragment.

   A host that receives a first-fragment that does not satisfy the
   above-stated requirements SHOULD discard that packet, and also MAY
   send an ICMPv6 error message to the source address of the offending
   packet (subject to the rules for ICMPv6 errors specified in
   [RFC4443]).

   Likewise, an intermediate system (e.g. router, firewall) that
   receives an IPv6 first-fragment that does not satisfy the above-
   stated requirements MAY discard that packet, and MAY send an ICMPv6
   error message to the source address of the offending packet (subject
   to the rules for ICMPv6 error messages specified in [RFC4443]).
   Intermediate systems having this capability SHOULD support
   configuration (e.g. enable/disable) of whether such packets are
   dropped or not by the intermediate system.

   If a host or intermediate system discards an first-fragment because
   it does not satisfy the above-stated requirements, and sends an
   ICMPv6 error message due to the discard, then the ICMPv6 error
   message MUST be Type 4 ("Parameter Problem") and MUST use Code TBD
   ("First-fragment has incomplete IPv6 Header Chain").

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add a the following entry to the "Reason Code"
   registry for ICMPv6 "Type 4 - Parameter Problem" messages:

      CODE     NAME/DESCRIPTION
       TBD     IPv6 first-fragment has incomplete IPv6 header chain

7.  Security Considerations

   This document describes how improperly-fragmented packets can prevent
   traditional stateless packet filtering.

   This document updates RFC 2460 such that those packets are forbidden,
   thus enabling stateless packet filtering for IPv6.

   This specification allows nodes that drop the aforementioned packets
   to signal such packet drops with ICMPv6 "Parameter Problem, IPv6
   first-fragment has incomplete IPv6 header chain" (Type 4, Code TBD)
   error messages.

   As with all ICMPv6 error/diagnostic messages, deploying Source
   Address Forgery Prevention filters helps reduce the chances of an
   attacker successfully performing a reflection attack by sending
   forged illegal packets with the victim/target's IPv6 address as the
   IPv6 Source Address of the illegal packet [RFC2827] [RFC3704].
