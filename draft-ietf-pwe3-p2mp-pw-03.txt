Abstract 

   This document specifies a mechanism to signal Point-to-Multipoint 
   (P2MP) Pseudowires (PW) tree using LDP. Such a mechanism is suitable 
   for any Layer 2 VPN service requiring P2MP connectivity over an IP or 
   MPLS enabled PSN. A P2MP PW established via the proposed mechanism is 
   root initiated.

1. Introduction 

      A Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Pseudowire (PW) emulates the 
   essential attributes of a unidirectional P2MP Telecommunications 
   service such as P2MP ATM over PSN. A major difference between a 
   Point-to-Point (P2P) PW outlined in [RFC3985] and a P2MP PW is that 
   the former is intended for bidirectional service whereas the latter 
   is intended for both unidirectional and bidirectional services. 
   Requirements for P2MP PW are described in [P2MP-PW-REQ].

   A P2MP PW can be constructed as either Single Segment (P2MP SS-PW) 
   or Multi Segment (P2MP MS-PW) Pseudowire as mentioned in [P2MP-PW-
   REQ]. P2MP MS-PW is outside the scope of this document.  A reference 
   model for P2MP PW is depicted in Figure 1 below. A transport LSP 
   associated with a P2MP SS-PW SHOULD be a P2MP MPLS LSP (i.e., P2MP 
   TE tunnel established via RSVP-TE [RFC4875] or P2MP LSP established 
   via mLDP [mLDP]) spanning from the Root-PE (R-PE) to the Leaf-PE(s) 
   (L-PEs) of the P2MP SS-PW tree. For example, in Figure 1, PW1 can be 
   associated with a P2MP TE tunnel or P2MP LSP setup using [mLDP] 
   originating from T-PE1 and terminating at T-PE2 and T-PE3. 
 
   Mechanisms for establishing P2P SS-PW using LDP are described in 
   [RFC4447]. In this document, we specify a method to signal P2MP PW 
   using LDP. In particular, we define new TLVs, parameters, and status 
   codes to facilitate LDP to signal and maintain P2MP PWs.

   As outlined in [P2MP-PW-REQ], even though the traffic flow from an 
   R-PE to L-PEs is P2MP in nature, it may be desirable for any L-PE to 
   send unidirectional P2P traffic destined only to the R-PE. The 
   proposed mechanism takes such option into consideration. 
    
   A P2MP PW requires an MPLS LSP to carry the PW traffic, and the MPLS 
   packets carried over the PW will be encapsulated according to the 
   methods described in [RFC5332].

3. Signaling P2MP PW 

   In order to advertise labels as well as exchange PW related LDP 
   messages, PEs must establish LDP sessions among themselves using the 
   Extended Discovery Mechanisms. A PE discovers other PEs that are to 
   be connected via P2MP PWs either via manual configuration or 
   autodiscovery [RFC6074]. 
 
   R-PE and each L-PE MUST be configured with the same FEC as defined 
   in the following section. 
 
   P2MP PW requires that there is an active P2MP transport LSP set up 
   between R-PE and L-PE(s). The procedure to set up the P2MP transport 
   LSP is different depending on the protocol used (RSVP-TE or mLDP). 
 
   In case of mLDP, an L-PE can decide to join the P2MP LSP at any 
   time, while in the case of RSVP-TE the P2MP transport LSP is set up 
   by the R-PE, generally at the initial service provisioning time. It 
   should be noted that local policy can override any decision to add 
   or prune existing or new L-PE(s) to/from the tree. In any case, the 
   PW setup can ignore these differences, and simply assume that the 
   P2MP transport LSP is available when needed. 
 
   A P2MP PW signaling is initiated by the R-PE simply by sending a 
   P2MP-PW LDP label mapping message to the L-PE(s) belonging to that 
   P2MP PW. This label mapping message will contain the following: 
    
          1. A P2MP Upstream PW FEC element. 
          2. An Interface Parameters TLV, as described in [RFC4447]. 
          3. A PW Grouping TLV as described in [RFC4447]. 
          4. A Transport LSP TLV. 
          5. A label TLV for the upstream-assigned label used by R-PE 
            for the traffic going from R-PE to L-PE(s). 
        


 
 
Sivabalan               Expires April 27, 2012                 [Page 5] 
                                                     
Internet-Draft      draft-ietf-pwe3-p2mp-pw-03.txt          October 2011 
 

   The R-PE imposes the upstream-assigned label on the outbound packets 
   sent over the P2MP-PW, and using this label an L-PE identifies the 
   inbound packets arriving over the P2MP PW. 
    
   Additionally, the R-PE MAY send label mapping message(s) to one or 
   more L-PE(s) to signal unidirectional P2P PW(s). The L-PE(s) can use 
   such PW(s) to send traffic to the R-PE. This optional label mapping 
   message will contain the following:   
        
          1. P2P Downstream PW FEC element. 
          2. A label TLV for the down-stream assigned label used by the 
            corresponding L-PE to send traffic to the R-PE. 
 
   The LDP liberal label retention mode is used, and per requirements 
   specified in [RFC5036], the label request message MUST also be 
   supported. 
 
   The upstream-assigned label is allocated according to the rules in 
   [RFC5331]. 
 
   When an L-PE receives a PW Label Mapping Message, it MUST verify 
   that the associated P2MP transport LSP is in place. If the 
   associated P2MP transport LSP is not in place, and its type is LDP 
   P2MP LSP, the L-PE SHOULD attempt to join the P2MP LSP. If the P2MP 
   transport LSP is not in place, and its type is RSVP-TE P2MP LSP, the 
   L-PE SHOULD wait till the P2MP transport LSP is signaled. 
    

3.1. PW ingress to egress incompatibility issues 

   If an R-PE signals a PW with a pw type, CW mode, or interface 
   parameters that a particular L-PE cannot accept, then the L-PE must 
   not enable the PW, and notify the user. In this case, a PW status 
   message of 0x00000001 (Pseudowire Not Forwarding) MUST also be sent 
   to the R-PE. 
 
   Note that this procedure does not apply if the L-PE had not been 
   provisioned with this particular P2MP PW. In this case according to 
   the LDP liberal label retention rules, no action is taken.

3.2. P2MP PW FEC 

  [RFC4447] specifies two types of LDP FEC elements called "PWid FEC 
   Element" and "Generalized PWid FEC Element" used to signal P2P PWs. 
   We define two new types of FEC element called "P2MP Upstream PW FEC 
   Element" and "P2P Downstream PW FEC Element". These FEC elements are 
   associated with a mandatory upstream assigned label and an optional 
   downstream assigned label respectively. 
    
   FEC type of the P2MP Upstream PW FEC Element is 0x82 (pending IANA 
   allocation) and is encoded as follows: 
    
 
    0                   1                   2                   3

     * PW Type: 
 
      15-bit representation of PW type, and the assigned values are 
      assigned by IANA. 
 
     * C bit: 
 
      A value of 1 or 0 indicates whether control word is present or 
      absent for the P2MP PW. 
 
     * PW Info Length: 
      Sum of the lengths of AGI, SAII and Optional Parameters field in 
      octets. If this value is 0, then it references all PWs using the 
      specified grouping ID.  In this case, there are neither other FEC 
      element fields (AGI, SAII, etc.) present, nor any interface 
      parameters TLVs. 
 
     * AGI: 
 
      Attachment Group Identifier can be used to uniquely identify VPN 
      or VPLS instance associated with the P2MP PW. This has the same 
      format as the Generalized PWid FEC element [RFC4447]. 
 
     * SAII: 
 
      Source Attachment Individual Identifier is used to identify the 
      root of the P2MP PW. The root is represented using AII type 2 
      format specified in [RFC5003].  Note that the SAII can be omitted 
      by simply setting the length and type to zero. 
 
      P2MP PW is identified by the Source Attachment Identifier (SAI). 
      If the AGI is non-null, the SAI is the combination of the SAII 
      and the AGI, if the AGI is null, the SAI is the SAII. 
 
     * Transport LSP TLV: 
 
      A P2MP PW MUST be associated with a transport LSP. The Transport 
      LSP TLV contains the information required to identify the 
      transport LSP. Transport LSP TLV MUST immediately follow the FEC,

      but is not part of the FEC, and SHOULD NOT be used in other 
      messages where the FEC is used. 
 
     * Optional Parameters: 
 
      The Optional Parameter field can contain some TLVs that are not 
      part of the FEC, but are necessary for the operation of the PW. 
      This proposed mechanism uses two such TVLs: Interface Parameters 
      TLV and Group ID TLV. 
 
     The Interface Parameters TLV and Group ID TLV specified in 
     [RFC4447] can also be used in conjunction with P2MP PW FEC. For 
     Group ID TLV the sender and receiver of these TLVs should follow 
     the same rules and procedures specified in [RFC4447]. For 
     Interface Parameters TLV the procedure differs from the one 
     specified in [RFC4447] due to specifics of P2MP connectivity. When 
     the interface parameters are signaled by an R-PE, each L-PE must 
     check if its configured value(s) is less than or equal to the 
     threshold value provided by the R-PE (e.g., MTU size (Ethernet), 
     max number of concatenated ATM cells, etc)). For other interface 
     parameters like CEP/TDM Payload bytes (TDM), the value MUST 
     exactly match the values signaled by the R-PE. 
      
     Multicast traffic stream associated with a P2MP PW can be 
     selective or inclusive. To support the former, this document 
     defines a new optional Selective Tree Interface Parameter sub-TLV 
     (type is pending IANA allocation) according to the format 
     described in [RFC4447]. The value of the sub-TLV contains the 
     source and the group for a given multicast tree as shown in Figure 
     3. This is similar to the way (S, G) is defined in [VPLS-MCAST]. 
     Also, if a P2MP PW is associated with multiple selective trees, 
     the corresponding label mapping message will carry more than one 
     instances of this Sub-TLV. Furthermore, in the absence of this 
     sub-TLV, the P2MP PW is associated with all multicast traffic 
     stream originating from the root.

   The Multicast Source field contains the address of the multicast 
   source. The Multicast Source field contains an IPv4 address or IPv6 
   address depending on whether the Multicast Source Length is 32 or 
   128. The Multicast Source Length can be set to 0 to indicate 
   wildcard. 
    
   The Multicast Group field contains the address of the multicast 
   group. The Multicast Group field contains an IPv4 address or IPv6 
   address depending on whether the Multicast Group Length is 32 or

   The definition of the fields in the P2P Downstream PW FEC Element is 
   the same as those of P2MP Upstream PW FEC Element. 
    
    
3.3. Group ID usage 

   The Grouping TLV as defined in [RFC4447] contains a group ID capable 
   of indicating an arbitrary group membership of a P2MP-PW. This group 
   ID can be used in LDP "wild card" status, and withdraw label 
   messages, as described in [RFC4447]. 
 
 
3.4. Generic Label TLV 

   As in the case of P2P PW signaling, P2MP PW labels are carried 
   within Generic Label TLV contained in LDP Label Mapping Message. A 
   Generic Label TLV is formatted and processed as per the rules and 
   procedures specified in [RFC4447]. For a given P2MP PW, a single 
   upstream-assigned label is allocated by the R-PE, and is advertised 
   to all the L-PEs using the Generic Label TLV in label mapping 
   message containing the P2MP Upstream PW FEC element.  
    


 
 
Sivabalan               Expires April 27, 2012                [Page 11] 
                                                     
Internet-Draft      draft-ietf-pwe3-p2mp-pw-03.txt          October 2011 
 

   The R-PE MAY also allocate a unique label for each L-PE from which 
   it intends to receive P2P traffic. Such a label is advertised to the 
   L-PE using Generic Label TLV in label mapping message. 
    
    
3.5. Transport LSP TLV 

   A P2MP PW MUST be associated with a transport LSP which can be 
   established using RSVP-TE or mLDP. Thus, a Label Mapping Message 
   MUST contain the identity of the transport LSP. For this purpose, 
   this specification introduces a new TLV called "Transport LSP TLV" 
   which has the following format: 
 
    0                   1                   2                   3

   Note: TLV number pending IANA allocation. 
    

     * Reserved Flags: 
 
      Reserved bits Must be set to 0 when transmitting the message, and 
       ignored on receiving the message. 
 
     * PMSI Tunnel Type: 
 
      The Transport LSP Type identifies the type of technology used to 
      establish a transport LSP. The PMSI tunnel type is defined in 
      [L3VPN-MCAST]. 
 


 
 
Sivabalan               Expires April 27, 2012                [Page 12] 
                                                     
Internet-Draft      draft-ietf-pwe3-p2mp-pw-03.txt          October 2011 
 

      When the type is set to mLDP P2MP LSP, the Tunnel Identifier is    
      a P2MP FEC Element as defined in [mLDP]. A new mLDP Opaque Value 
      Element type for L2VPN-MCAST application needs to be allocated. 
 
       Editor Comment: The content of the Opaque Value Element TLV is a 
       TBD. 
 
     * Tunnel Identifier: 
 
      The Tunnel containing the Transport LSP is identified by the 
      Tunnel Identifier which is defined in [L3VPN-MCAST]. 
 
      Transport LSP TLV MUST be present only in the Label Mapping 
      Message. An R-PE sends Label Mapping Message as soon as the 
      transport LSP ID associated with the P2MP PW is known (e.g., via 
      configuration) regardless of the operational state of that 
      transport LSP. Similarly, an R-PE does not withdraw the labels 
      when the corresponding transport LSP goes down.  Furthermore, an 
      L-PE retains the P2MP PW labels regardless of the operational 
      status of the transport LSP. 
 
   Note that a given transport LSP can be associated with more than one 
   P2MP PWs and all P2MP PWs will be sharing the same R-PE and L-PE(s). 
 
   In the case of LDP P2MP LSP, when an L-PE receives the Label 
   Mapping Message, it can initiate the process of joining the P2MP LSP 
   tree associated with the P2MP PW. 
 
   In the case of RSVP-TE P2MP LSP, only the R-PE initiates the 
   signaling of P2MP LSP. 
 

4. LDP Capability Negotiation 

   The capability of supporting P2MP PW must be advertised to all LDP 
   peers. This is achieved by using the methods in [RFC5561] and 
   advertising the P2MP PW LDP capability TLV. If an LDP peer supports 
   the dynamic capability advertisement, this can be done by sending a 
   new capability message with the S bit set for the P2MP PW capability 
   TLV. If the peer does not support dynamic capability advertisement, 
   then the P2MP PW TLV MUST be included in the LDP initialization

   procedures in the capability parameter [RFC5561]. An LSR having P2MP 
   PW capability MUST recognize both P2MP Upstream FEC Element and P2P 
   Downstream FEC Element in LDP Label Binding Message. 
 
   In line with requirements listed in [RFC5561] the following TLV is 
   defined to indicate the P2MP PW capability: 
 
    0                   1                   2                   3

      The TLV type identifies a specific capability. The P2MP PW 
      capability code point is requested in the IANA allocation section 
      below. 
 
     * S-bit: 
 
      The State Bit indicates whether the sender is advertising or 
      withdrawing the P2MP PW capability. The State bit is used as 
      follows: 
            1 - The TLV is advertising the capability specified by the 
            TLV Code Point.

Internet-Draft      draft-ietf-pwe3-p2mp-pw-03.txt          October 2011 
 

            0 - The TLV is withdrawing the capability specified by the 
            TLV Code Point. 
 
 
5. P2MP PW Status 

   In order to support the proposed mechanism, a node MUST be capable 
   of handling PW status. As such, PW status negotiation procedure 
   described in [RFC4447] is not applicable to P2MP PW. 
 
   Once an L-PE successfully processes a Label Mapping Message for a 
   P2MP PW, it MUST send appropriate PW status according to the 
   procedure specified [RFC4447] to notify the PW status. If there is 
   no PW status notification required, then no PW status notification 
   is sent (for example if the P2MP PW is established and operational 
   with a status of 0x00000000, pw status message is not necessary). PW 
   status message sent from any L-PE to R-PE contains P2P Downstream PW 
   FEC to identify the PW. 
    
   An R-PE also sends PW status to L-PE(s) to reflect its view of a 
   P2MP PW state. Such PW status message contains P2MP Upstream PW FEC 
   to identify the PW. 
 
   Connectivity status of the underlying P2MP LSP that P2MP PW is 
   associated with, can be verified using LSP Ping and Traceroute 
   procedures described in [P2MP-LSP-PING]. 
    

6. Security Considerations 

   The security measures described in [RFC4447] is adequate for the 
   proposed mechanism.
