Internet-Draft         A Reputation Query Protocol             June 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a method to query a reputation data service for
   information about an entity, using the HyperText Transfer Protocol
   (HTTP) as the transport mechanism and JSON as the payload meta-
   format.


2.  Terminology and Definitions

   This section defines terms used in the rest of the document.

2.1.  Key Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

2.2.  Other Definitions

   Other terms of importance in this document are defined in
   [I-D.REPUTE-MODEL] and [I-D.REPUTE-MEDIA-TYPE].


3.  Description

3.1.  Overview

   The components to the question being asked comprise the following:

   o  The subject of the query;

   o  The name of the host, or the IP address, at which the reputation
      service is available;

   o  The name of the reputation application, i.e., the context within
      which the subject is being evaluated;

   o  Optionally, name(s) of the specific reputation assertions or
      attributies that are being requested.

   Assertions are discussed in [I-D.REPUTE-MEDIA-TYPE].

   The name of the application, if given, is expected to be one
   registered with IANA in the Reputation Applications Registry, which
   is defined in [I-D.REPUTE-MEDIA-TYPE].  A server receiving a query
   about an application it does not recognize or explicitly support
   support (e.g., by virtue of private agreements or experimental

   extensions) MUST return a 404 error code.

   A reputation query made via [HTTP] encodes the question being asked
   in an HTTP GET method.  The specific syntax of the query itself is
   specified by retrieving a URI template from the reputation service,
   completing the template, and then issuing the query.

3.2.  URI Template

   The template file is retrieved by requesting the [WELL-KNOWN-URI]
   "repute-template" from the host providing reputation service, using
   HTTP.  (The registration for this well-known URI is in Section 4.)
   The server returns the template file in a reply that MUST use the
   text/plain media type (see [MIME]), and SHOULD include an Expires
   field (see Section 14.21 of [HTTP]) indicating a duration for which
   the template is to be considered valid by clients and not re-queried.

   Clients SHOULD NOT repeat the query prior to the timestamp in the
   Expires field, or wait no less than one day if the Expires field is
   not present.

   The template file might contain more than one template.  Such a file
   MUST have each template separated by a newline (ASCII 0x0D)
   character.

   Each template in the file is expanded using the variables that are
   the parameters to the query.  The client then selects any expanded
   template it is able to use (i.e., using a scheme the client
   supports), and then uses the expanded template as the target for the
   query itself.  This allows for discovery of alternatives to HTTP that
   the client might be able to use.

   For example, given the following template:

   {scheme}://{service}/{application}/{subject}/{assertion}

   A query about the use of the domain "example.org" in the "email-id"
   application context to a service run at "example.com", where that
   application declares a required "subject" parameter, requesting the
   "SPAM" reputation assertion, using HTTP to conduct the query with no
   specific client authentication information, would be formed as
   follows:

   http://example.com/email-id/example.org/spam

Internet-Draft         A Reputation Query Protocol             June 2013


3.3.  Syntax

   The syntax for the [URI] of the query is constructed using a template
   as per [URI-TEMPLATE].  (See Section 3.2.)  Clients MUST have the
   following available for template expansion:

   application:  The name of the application reputation in whose context
      the request is being made.

   scheme:  The transport scheme the client will be using for the query.

   service:  The hostname or IP address to which the query is being
      sent.

   subject:  The subject of the query.

   Which scheme(s) can be used depends on how the reputation service
   provider offers its services.  Thus, the template could include a
   specific scheme as a fixed string in the template, or it might offer
   it as a variable in the template.  Note that a template could specify
   a scheme the client is not equipped to use.

   For example, the following query template includes a fixed scheme,
   forcing clients to use the "http" URI scheme only:

       http://{service}/repute.php{?subject,application,assertion}

   However, this template allows the client to select the scheme to be
   used if, for example, the service is also available over the "https"
   URI scheme:

       {scheme}://{service}/repute.php{?subject,application,assertion}

   The following variable is OPTIONAL to this base specification, but
   might be required by the template presented for a specific service:

   assertion:  A list of one or more specific assertions of interest to
      the client.  If absent, the client is indicating that it requests
      all available assertion information.

   Every application space has a set of assertions applicable to its own
   context.  [I-D.REPUTE-MEDIA-TYPE] defines a single assertion assumed
   to exist in any application that does not define its own assertion
   set.

   Reputation applications can extend the set of optional or required
   query parameters as part of their IANA registration actions.  The set
   enumerated above establishes the base set common to all of them.

Internet-Draft         A Reputation Query Protocol             June 2013


   Further, additional required or optional extension query parameters
   might be defined by specific reputation service providers, though
   these are private arrangements between client and server and will not
   be registered with IANA.

   Authentication between reputation client and server is outside the
   scope of this specification.  It could be provided through a variety
   of available transport-based or object-based mechanisms, including a
   later extension of this specification.

3.4.  Response

   The response is expected to be contained in a media type designed to
   deliver reputons.  An media type designed for this purpose,
   "application/reputon+json", is defined in [I-D.REPUTE-MEDIA-TYPE].

3.5.  Protocol Support

   A client has to implement HTTP in order to retrieve the query
   template as described in Section 3.2.  Accordingly, a server can
   assume the client will be able to handle a URI template that produces
   a URI for the query using the "http" scheme.  If the template can
   yield a query string that uses some other URI scheme, there will need
   to be some out-of-band negotiation of which scheme(s) are supported
   by the service, and appropriate protocol support in the client.

   A server SHOULD include support for providing service over HTTP, and
   publish templates indicating support for this, as a baseline for
   interoperability with arbitrary clients.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the "repute-template" well-known URI in the
   Well-Known URI registry as defined by [WELL-KNOWN-URI], as follows:

   URI suffix:  repute-template

   Change controller:  IETF

   Specification document(s):  [this document]

   Related information:  none

5.  Security Considerations

   This document defines particular uses of existing protocols for a
   specific application.  In particular, the basic protocol used for
   this service to retrieve a URI template from a well-known location is
   basic HTTP, which is not secure without certain extensions.  Security
   issues relevant to use of URI templates are discussed in
   [URI-TEMPLATE], and those relevant to well-known URI definitions and
   retrieval are discussed in [WELL-KNOWN-URI].

   The reputation service itself will use HTTP or other transport
   methods to issue queries and receive replies.  Those protocols have
   registered URI schemes and, as such, presumably have documented
   security considerations.  The protocol described here operates atop
   those schemes, and does not itself present new security
   considerations.

   Reputation mechanisms represent an obvious security concern, in terms
   of the validity and use of the reputation information.  These issues
   are beyond the scope of this specification.  General information
   pertaining to using or providing reputation services can be found in
   [I-D.REPUTE-CONSIDERATIONS].
