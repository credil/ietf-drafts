             Revised Error Handling for BGP UPDATE Messages
                  draft-ietf-idr-error-handling-03.txt


Abstract

   According to the base BGP specification, a BGP speaker that receives
   an UPDATE message containing a malformed attribute is required to
   reset the session over which the offending attribute was received.
   This behavior is undesirable as a session reset would impact not only
   routes with the offending attribute, but also other valid routes
   exchanged over the session.  This document partially revises the
   error handling for UPDATE messages, and provides guidelines for the
   authors of documents defining new attributes.  Finally, it revises
   the error handling procedures for a number of existing attributes.

1. Introduction

   According to the base BGP specification [RFC4271], a BGP speaker that
   receives an UPDATE message containing a malformed attribute is
   required to reset the session over which the offending attribute was
   received.  This behavior is undesirable as a session reset would
   impact not only routes with the offending attribute, but also other
   valid routes exchanged over the session.  In the case of optional
   transitive attributes, the behavior is especially troublesome and may
   present a potential security vulnerability.  The reason is that such
   attributes may have been propagated without being checked by
   intermediate routers that do not recognize the attributes -- in
   effect the attribute may have been tunneled, and when they do reach a
   router that recognizes and checks them, the session that is reset may
   not be associated with the router that is at fault.

   The goal for revising the error handling for UPDATE messages is to
   minimize the impact on routing by a malformed UPDATE message, while
   maintaining protocol correctness to the extent possible.  This can be
   achieved largely by maintaining the established session and keeping
   the valid routes exchanged, but removing the routes carried in the
   malformed UPDATE from the routing system.

   This document partially revises the error handling for UPDATE
   messages, and provides guidelines for the authors of documents
   defining new attributes.  Finally, it revises the error handling
   procedures for a number of existing attributes.  Specifically, the
   error handling procedures of [RFC4271], [RFC1997], [RFC4360] and
   [RFC5701] are revised.

1.1. Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2. Revision to Base Specification

   The first paragraph of Section 6.3 of [RFC4271] is revised as
   follows:

   Old Text:

      All errors detected while processing the UPDATE message MUST be
      indicated by sending the NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code
      UPDATE Message Error. The error subcode elaborates on the specific
      nature of the error.

   New text:

      An error detected while processing the UPDATE message for which a
      session reset is specified MUST be indicated by sending the
      NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code UPDATE Message Error.
      The error subcode elaborates on the specific nature of the error.

   The error handling of the following case described in Section 6.3 of
   [RFC4271] remains unchanged:

      If the Withdrawn Routes Length or Total Attribute Length
      is too large (i.e., if Withdrawn Routes Length + Total Attribute
      Length + 23 exceeds the message Length), then the Error Subcode
      MUST be set to Malformed Attribute List.

   The error handling of the following case described in Section 6.3 of
   [RFC4271] is revised

      If any recognized attribute has Attribute Flags that conflict with
      the Attribute Type Code, then the Error Subcode MUST be set to
      Attribute Flags Error.  The Data field MUST contain the erroneous
      attribute (type, length, and value).

   as follows:

      If the "Optional bit" or the "Transitive bit" in the Attribute
      Flags for an attribute conflicts with the Attribute Type Code,
      then the error SHOULD be logged, and the conflicting bit in the
      Attribute Flags MUST be reset to the correct value.  The UPDATE

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-idr-error-handling-03.txt         Nov. 2012


      message MUST continue to be processed.

   The error handling of all other cases described in Section 6.3 of
   [RFC4271] that specify a session reset is revised as follows.

   When a path attribute (other than the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute
   [RFC4760] or the MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute [RFC4760]) in an UPDATE
   message is determined to be malformed, the UPDATE message containing
   that attribute MUST be treated as though all contained routes had
   been withdrawn just as if they had been listed in the WITHDRAWN
   ROUTES field (or in the MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute if appropriate) of
   the UPDATE message, thus causing them to be removed from the Adj-RIB-
   In according to the procedures of [RFC4271].  In the case of an
   attribute which has no effect on route selection or installation, the
   malformed attribute MAY instead be discarded and the UPDATE message
   continue to be processed.  For the sake of brevity, the former
   approach is termed "treat-as-withdraw", and the latter as "attribute
   discard".

   If any of the well-known mandatory attributes are not present in an
   UPDATE message, then the approach of "treat-as-withdraw" MUST be used
   for the error handling.

   The approach of "treat-as-withdraw" MUST be used for the error
   handling of the cases described in Section 6.3 of [RFC4271] that
   specify a session reset and involve any of the following attributes:
   ORIGIN, AS_PATH, NEXT_HOP, MULTI_EXIT_DISC, and LOCAL_PREF.

   The approach of "attribute discard" MUST be used for the error
   handling of the cases described in Section 6.3 of [RFC4271] that
   specify a session reset and involve any of the following attributes:
   ATOMIC_AGGREGATE and AGGREGATOR.

   If the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute or the MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute
   appears more than once in the UPDATE message, then a NOTIFICATION
   message MUST be sent with the Error Subcode "Malformed Attribute
   List".  If any other attribute appears more than once in an UPDATE
   message, then all the occurrences of the attribute other than the
   first one SHALL be discarded and the UPDATE message continue to be
   processed.

   When multiple malformed attributes exist in an UPDATE message, if the
   same approach (either "session reset", or "treat-as-withdraw" or
   "attribute discard") is specified for the handling of these malformed
   attributes, then the specified approach MUST be used. Otherwise the
   approach with the strongest action MUST be used following the order
   of "session reset", "treat-as-withdraw" and "attribute discard" from
   the strongest to the weakest.



draft-ietf-idr-error-handling-03.txt                            [Page 4]





Internet Draft    draft-ietf-idr-error-handling-03.txt         Nov. 2012


   A document which specifies a new attribute MUST provide specifics
   regarding what constitutes an error for that attribute and how that
   error is to be handled.

   Finally, we observe that in order to use the approach of "treat-as-
   withdraw", the entire NLRI field and/or the MP_REACH_NLRI and
   MP_UNREACH_NLRI attributes need to be successfully parsed.  If this
   is not possible, the procedures of [RFC4271] continue to apply.
   Alternatively the error handling procedures specified in [RFC4760]
   for disabling a particular AFI/SAFI MAY be followed.


3. Parsing of NLRI Fields

   To facilitate the determination of the NLRI field in an UPDATE with a
   malformed attribute, the MP_REACH_NLRI or MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute
   (if present) SHALL be encoded as the very first path attribute in an
   UPDATE.  An implementation, however, MUST still be prepared to
   receive these fields in any position.

   If the encoding of [RFC4271] is used, the NLRI field for the IPv4
   unicast address family is carried immediately following all the
   attributes in an UPDATE.  When such an UPDATE is received, we observe
   that the NLRI field can be determined using the "Message Length",
   "Withdrawn Route Length" and "Total Attribute Length" (when they are
   consistent) carried in the message instead of relying on the length
   of individual attributes in the message.


4. Operational Considerations

   Although the "treat-as-withdraw" error-handling behavior defined in
   Section 2 makes every effort to preserve BGP's correctness, we note
   that if an UPDATE received on an IBGP session is subjected to this
   treatment, inconsistent routing within the affected Autonomous System
   may result.  The consequences of inconsistent routing can include
   long-lived forwarding loops and black holes.  While lamentable, this
   issue is expected to be rare in practice, and more importantly is
   seen as less problematic than the session-reset behavior it replaces.

   When a malformed attribute is indeed detected over an IBGP session,
   we RECOMMEND that routes with the malformed attribute be identified
   and traced back to the ingress router in the network where the routes
   were sourced or received externally, and then a filter be applied on
   the ingress router to prevent the routes from being sourced or
   received.  This will help maintain routing consistency in the
   network.




draft-ietf-idr-error-handling-03.txt                            [Page 5]





Internet Draft    draft-ietf-idr-error-handling-03.txt         Nov. 2012


   Even if inconsistent routing does not arise, the "treat-as-withdraw"
   behavior can cause either complete unreachability or sub-optimal
   routing for the destinations whose routes are carried in the affected
   UPDATE message.

   Note that "treat-as-withdraw" is different from discarding an UPDATE
   message.  The latter violates the basic BGP principle of incremental
   update, and could cause invalid routes to be kept.  (See also
   Appendix A.)

   For any malformed attribute which is handled by the "attribute
   discard" instead of the "treat-as-withdraw" approach, it is critical
   to consider the potential impact of doing so.  In particular, if the
   attribute in question has or may have an effect on route selection or
   installation, the presumption is that discarding it is unsafe, unless
   careful analysis proves otherwise.  The analysis should take into
   account the tradeoff between preserving connectivity and potential
   side effects.

   Because of these potential issues, a BGP speaker MUST provide
   debugging facilities to permit issues caused by a malformed attribute
   to be diagnosed.  At a minimum, such facilities MUST include logging
   an error listing the NLRI involved, and containing the entire
   malformed UPDATE message when such an attribute is detected.  The
   malformed UPDATE message SHOULD be analyzed, and the root cause
   SHOULD be investigated.


5. Error Handling Procedures for Existing Attributes


5.1. ORIGIN

   The attribute is considered malformed if its length is not 1, or it
   has an undefined value [RFC4271].

   An UPDATE message with a malformed ORIGIN attribute SHALL be handled
   using the approach of "treat-as-withdraw".


5.2. AS_PATH

   The error conditions for the attribute have been defined in
   [RFC4271].

   An UPDATE message with a malformed AS_PATH attribute SHALL be handled
   using the approach of "treat-as-withdraw".

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-idr-error-handling-03.txt         Nov. 2012


5.3. NEXT_HOP

   The error conditions for the NEXT_HOP attribute have been defined in
   [RFC4271].

   An UPDATE message with a malformed NEXT_HOP attribute SHALL be
   handled using the approach of "treat-as-withdraw".


5.4. MULTI_EXIT_DESC

   The attribute is considered malformed if its length is not 4
   [RFC4271].

   An UPDATE message with a malformed MULTI_EXIT_DESC attribute SHALL be
   handled using the approach of "treat-as-withdraw".


5.5. LOCAL_PREF

   The attribute is considered malformed if its length is not 4
   [RFC4271].

   An UPDATE message with a malformed LOCAL_PREF attribute SHALL be
   handled as follows:

      o using the approach of "attribute discard" if the UPDATE message
   is received from an external neighbor, or

      o using the approach of "treat-as-withdraw" if the UPDATE message
   is received from an internal neighbor.

   In addition, if the attribute is present in an UPDATE message from an
   external neighbor, the approach of "attribute discard" SHALL be used
   to handle the unexpected attribute in the message.


5.6. ATOMIC_AGGREGATE

   The attribute SHALL be considered malformed if its length is not 0
   [RFC4271].

   An UPDATE message with a malformed ATOMIC_AGGREGATE attribute SHALL
   be handled using the approach of "attribute discard".

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-idr-error-handling-03.txt         Nov. 2012


5.7. AGGREGATOR

   The error conditions specified in [RFC4271] for the attribute are
   revised as follows:

   The AGGREGATOR attribute SHALL be considered malformed if any of the
   following applies:

      o  Its length is not 6 (when the "4-octet AS number capability" is
         not advertised to, or not received from the peer [RFC4893]).

      o  Its length is not 8 (when the "4-octet AS number capability" is
         both advertised to, and received from the peer).

   An UPDATE message with a malformed AGGREGATOR attribute SHALL be
   handled using the approach of "attribute discard".


5.8. Community

   The error handling of [RFC1997] is revised as follows:

   The Community attribute SHALL be considered malformed if its length
   is nonzero and is not a multiple of 4.

   An UPDATE message with a malformed Community attribute SHALL be
   handled using the approach of "treat-as-withdraw".


5.9. Extended Community

   The error handling of [RFC4360] is revised as follows:

   The Extended Community attribute SHALL be considered malformed if its
   length is nonzero and is not a multiple of 8.

   An UPDATE message with a malformed Extended Community attribute SHALL
   be handled using the approach of "treat-as-withdraw".

   Note that a BGP speaker MUST NOT treat an unrecognized Extended
   Community Type or Sub-Type as an error.

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-idr-error-handling-03.txt         Nov. 2012


5.10. IPv6 Address Specific BGP Extended Community Attribute

   The error handling of [RFC5701] is revised as follows:

   The IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community attribute SHALL be
   considered malformed if its length is nonzero and is not a multiple
   of 20.

   An UPDATE message with a malformed IPv6 Address Specific Extended
   Community attribute SHALL be handled using the approach of "treat-as-
   withdraw".

   Note that a BGP speaker MUST NOT treat an unrecognized IPv6 Address
   Specific Extended Community Type or Sub-Type as an error.


6. IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.


7. Security Considerations

   This specification addresses the vulnerability of a BGP speaker to a
   potential attack whereby a distant attacker can generate a malformed
   optional transitive attribute that is not recognized by intervening
   routers (which thus propagate the attribute unchecked) but that
   causes session resets when it reaches routers that do recognize the
   given attribute type.

   In other respects, this specification does not change BGP's security
   characteristics.

Appendix A.  Why not discard UPDATE messages?

   A commonly asked question is "why not simply discard the UPDATE
   message instead of treating it like a withdraw?  Isn't that safer and
   easier?"  The answer is that it might be easier, but it would
   compromise BGP's correctness so is unsafe.  Consider the following
   example of what might happen if UPDATE messages carrying bad
   attributes were simply discarded:


                             AS1 ---- AS2
                               \      /
                                \    /
                                 \  /
                                  AS3


   o  AS1 prefers to reach AS3 directly, and advertises its route to
      AS2.



draft-ietf-idr-error-handling-03.txt                           [Page 10]





Internet Draft    draft-ietf-idr-error-handling-03.txt         Nov. 2012


   o  AS2 prefers to reach AS3 directly, and advertises its route to
      AS1.

   o  Connections AS3-AS1 and AS3-AS2 fail simultaneously.

   o  AS1 switches to prefer AS2's route, and sends an update message
      which includes a withdraw of its previous announcement.  The
      withdraw is bundled with some advertisements.  It includes a bad
      attribute.  As a result, AS2 ignores the message.

   o  AS2 switches to prefer AS1's route, and sends an update message
      which includes a withdraw of its previous announcement.  The
      withdraw is bundled with some advertisements.  It includes a bad
      attribute.  As a result, AS1 ignores the message.

   The end result is that AS1 forwards traffic for AS3 towards AS2, and
   AS2 forwards traffic for AS3 towards AS1.  This is a permanent (until
   corrected) forwarding loop.

   Although the example above discusses route withdraws, we observe that
   in BGP the announcement of a route also withdraws the route
   previously advertised.  The implicit withdraw can be converted into a
   real withdraw in a number of ways; for example, the previously-
   announced route might have been accepted by policy, but the new
   announcement might be rejected by policy.  For this reason, the same
   concerns apply even if explicit withdraws are removed from
   consideration.
