Internet-Draft            Applicability of TTZ              October 2013


1.  Introduction

   The number of routers in a network becomes larger and larger as the
   Internet traffic keeps growing.  Through splitting the network into
   multiple areas, we can extend the network further.  However, there
   are a number of issues when a network is split further into more
   areas.

   At first, dividing an AS or an area into multiple areas is a very
   challenging task since it is involved in significant network
   architecture changes.

   Secondly, it is complex for a Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
   Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switching Path (LSP) crossing multiple
   areas to be setup.  In one option, a TE path crossing multiple areas
   is computed by using collaborating Path Computation Elements (PCEs)
   [RFC5441] through the PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP)[RFC5440],
   which is not easy to configure by operators since the manual
   configuration of the sequence of domains is required.  Although this
   issue can be addressed by using the Hierarchical PCE, this solution
   may further increase the complexity of network design.  Especially,
   the current PCE standard method may not guarantee that the path found
   is optimal.

   Furthermore, some policies need to be configured on area border
   routers for reducing the number of link states such as summary Link-
   State Advertisements (LSAs) to be distributed to other routers in
   other areas.

   This document introduces a technology called Topology-Transparent
   Zone (TTZ), presents a number of application scenarios of TTZ and
   illustrates that TTZ can resolve the issues above.


2.  Overview of Topology-Transparent Zone

   This section briefs the concept of Topology-Transparent Zone (TTZ)
   and explains the TTZ in some details through an example.

2.1.  Definitions of Topology-Transparent Zone

   A Topology-Transparent Zone (TTZ) comprises an Identifier (ID), a
   group of routers and a number of links connecting the routers.  A
   Topology-Transparent Zone is in an OSPF area.

   The ID of a Topology-Transparent Zone (TTZ) or TTZ ID for short is a
   number that is unique for identifying a node in an OSPF domain.  It
   is not zero in general.

Internet-Draft            Applicability of TTZ              October 2013


   A TTZ may be virtualized as a different object in a different way.
   Two typical ways are given below.

   In a first way, a TTZ may be virtualized as a group of TTZ edge
   routers fully connected.  From a router outside of the TTZ, a TTZ is
   seen as a group of TTZ edge routers, which are fully connected.

   In a second way, a TTZ may be seen as a single router.  From a router
   outside of the TTZ, a TTZ is seen as a special single router.  This
   router has a router ID, which is the TTZ ID or the maximum ID among
   all the router IDs of the routers in the TTZ.  For every connection
   between a TTZ edge router and a router outside of TTZ, there is a
   connection between the special router and the router outside of TTZ.

   The virtualization of TTZ in the first way is described and used
   below.

2.2.  An Example of TTZ

   The figure below illustrates an example of a routing area containing
   a topology-transparent zone: TTZ 600.

Internet-Draft            Applicability of TTZ              October 2013


   The routing area comprises routers R15, R17, R23, R25, R29 and R31.
   It also contains a topology-transparent zone TTZ 600, which comprises
   routers R61, R63, R65, R67, R71 and R73, and the links connecting
   them.

   There are two types of routers in a Topology-Transparent Zone (TTZ):
   TTZ internal routers and TTZ edge routers.  A TTZ internal router is
   a router inside the TTZ and every adjacent router of the TTZ internal
   router is a router inside the TTZ.  A TTZ edge router is a router
   inside the TTZ and has at least one adjacent router that is outside
   of the TTZ and at least one adjacent router that is inside the TTZ.

   The TTZ in the figure above comprises four TTZ edge routers R61, R63,
   R65 and R67.  Each TTZ edge router is connected to at least one
   router outside of the TTZ.  For instance, router R61 is a TTZ edge
   router since it is connected to router R15, which is outside of the
   TTZ.

   In addition, the TTZ comprises two TTZ internal routers R71 and R73.
   A TTZ internal router is not connected to any router outside of the
   TTZ.  For instance, router R71 is a TTZ internal router since it is
   not connected to any router outside of the TTZ.  It is just connected
   to routers R61, R63, R65, R67 and R73 inside the TTZ.

   A TTZ may hide the information inside the TTZ from the outside.  It
   may not distribute any internal information about the TTZ to a router
   outside of the TTZ.

   For instance, the TTZ in the figure above does not send the
   information about TTZ internal router R71 to any router outside of
   the TTZ in the routing domain; it does not send the information about
   the link between R61 and R65 to any router outside of the TTZ.

   In order to create a TTZ, we MUST configure the same TTZ ID on the
   edge routers and identify the TTZ internal links on them.  In
   addition, we SHOULD configure the TTZ ID on every TTZ internal router
   which indicates that every link of the router is a TTZ internal link.

   From a router outside of the TTZ, a TTZ is seen as a group of routers
   fully connected.  For instance, router R15 in the figure above, which
   is outside of TTZ 600, sees TTZ 600 as a group of TTZ edge routers:
   R61, R63, R65 and R67.  These four TTZ edge routers are fully
   connected.

   In addition, a router outside of the TTZ sees TTZ edge routers having
   normal connections to the routers outside of the TTZ.  For example,
   router R15 sees four TTZ edge routers R61, R63, R65 and R67, which
   have the normal connections to R15, R29, R17 and R23, R25 and R31

   respectively.


3.  Applicability of Topology-Transparent Zone

   Topology-Transparent Zone (TTZ) may be used in different cases.  This
   section presents a number of application scenarios of TTZ and
   illustrates the benefits that TTZ brings in each scenario.

3.1.  One Area Network

   Many networks start with one area.  A network with only one area is
   easy to operate and maintain.  As a network with one area becomes
   bigger and bigger because the increasing traffic in the network
   drives the expansion of the network, it needs to be split into
   multiple areas in general.

3.1.1.  Issues on Splitting Network into Areas

   Splitting a network with only one area into multiple areas is a very
   challenging task and may raise a number of issues.

   1.  Significant Changes on Network Architecture

   There are significant changes on network architecture when splitting
   a network with one area into multiple areas.  Originally the network
   has only one area, which is backbone area.  This original backbone
   area will be split into a new backbone area and a number of non
   backbone areas.

   In general, each of the non backbone areas is connected to the new
   backbone area through the area border routers between the non
   backbone area and the backbone area.  There is not any direct
   connection between any two non backbone areas.  Each area border
   router summarizes the topology of its attached non backbone area for
   transmission on the backbone area, and hence to all other area border
   routers.

   Before splitting the network into areas, every router in the network
   has the information about the network topology.  However, after
   splitting the network into areas, each router in an area has the
   information of the topology of the area, and it does not have the
   information of the topology of any other area.  It has only the
   summary information about the other areas.

   2.  Complex for MPLS TE Tunnel Setup

   Each of the MPLS TE LSP tunnels originally in one area, which has its



Chen, et al.             Expires April 24, 2014                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft            Applicability of TTZ              October 2013


   ingress and egress in different areas after the network splitting,
   needs to be re-configured and re-established.  It is very complex for
   a MPLS TE LSP tunnel crossing areas to be set up.

   In order to reduce the manual configurations for a MPLS TE LSP tunnel
   crossing multiple areas, we use PCEs to compute the path for the
   tunnel.  Thus we must configure PCEs for the network split into
   multiple areas.

   In addition, we need to provide a sequence of areas for the tunnel
   through manual configurations.  The tunnel will go through the
   sequence of areas provided.

   More critically, there are some issues on using PCEs.  One of them is
   that the path computed by PCEs for the tunnel may not be optimal.  If
   the optimal path for the tunnel is not in the sequence of areas
   configured by users, the path found by PCEs for the tunnel will not
   be optimal.

   3.  Policy Configurations

   Some policies need to be applied on area border routers for reducing
   the number of link states such as summary LSAs to be distributed to
   other routers in other areas.

   On an ABR between a non backbone area (say area A) and the backbone
   area (say area B), there are four sets of policies, which may be
   configured.  One set of them is the policies that block some summary
   LSA distributions from area B to area A. The second set of them is
   the policies that aggregate some routes for reducing the number of
   summary LSAs to be distributed from area B to area A. The third set
   is the policies that block some summary LSA distributions from area A
   to area B. The forth set of them is the policies that aggregate some
   routes for reducing the number of summary LSAs to be distributed to
   area A from area B.

   In addition, OSPF need to be disabled before any of the policy
   commands is issued.  And then OSPF must be enabled after the policies
   are configured.

3.1.2.  Use of TTZ in One Area Network

   The issues mentioned above on splitting network into areas disappear
   if we do not split network into areas and use OSPF Topology
   Transparent Zone (TTZ) instead.

   TTZ may be applied to a group of routers and links in the network
   directly.  For a group of routers and links connecting the routers in

Internet-Draft            Applicability of TTZ              October 2013


   the group in the network, no matter where it resides in the network,
   we may configure it as an OSPF TTZ as long as each router in the
   group can reach the other routers in the group through those links.

   1.  No Significant Changes on Network Architecture

   There is not any significant changes on network architecture when an
   OSPF TTZ is applied to a group of routers and links in the network
   directly.

   At first, we do not add any new connection to the network, or remove
   any existing connection from the network.

   Secondly, every router outside of the TTZ is not aware of the TZZ.
   Even the router directly connecting to the TTZ is not aware of the
   TTZ.

   Furthermore, every router in the network still has a topology view of
   the network.  Except for those internal TTZ routers and links, which
   are hidden, every router outside of the TTZ has the link state
   information about all the routers and links in the network.

   2.  Easy for MPLS TE Tunnel Setup

   After a group of routers and links in the network is configured as an
   OSPF TTZ, a MPLS TE LSP tunnel with an ingress router and an egress
   router, which are anywhere in the network, can be configured in a
   way, which is the same as or similar to the way in which a MPLS TE
   LSP tunnel in one area network is configured.

   For example, in the network in Figure 1 above, a MPLS TE LSP tunnel
   from ingress router R15 to egress router R29 can be configured in the
   same way as a MPLS TE LSP tunnel in one area network through
   provisioning the ingress router R15's IP address, the egress router
   R29's IP address and some constraints for the tunnel on the ingress
   router R15.

   We do not need any PCEs for computing the constrained path for a MPLS
   TE LSP tunnel in the network with OSPF Topology Transparent Zones
   (TTZs).  After a MPLS TE LSP tunnel with an ingress and egress
   anywhere in the network with OSPF TTZs is configured, the ingress
   computes the constrained path for the tunnel from the ingress to the
   egress in the same way as it computes the constrained path for the
   tunnel in one area network.  The constrained path computed may go
   through some OSPF TTZs.

   For example, in the network in Figure 1 above, the constrained path
   computed for the tunnel from ingress router R15 to egress router R29

Internet-Draft            Applicability of TTZ              October 2013


   may be from ingress router R15, to edge router R61 of TTZ 600, to
   edge router R63 of TTZ 600 and then to egress router R29.

   As soon as the constrained path for a MPLS TE LSP tunnel is computed
   or given through configuration, the LSP can be established along the
   path by the signaling protocol RSVP-TE.

   3.  No Policy Configurations

   There is not any policy configuration for the use of TTZ in one area
   network.  When we apply a TTZ to a group of routers and links
   connecting the routers, we just configure a TTZ link attribute TTZ ID
   on each of the links.

3.2.  Multi-Area Network

   For a network with multiple areas, it typically needs to be split
   into more areas when the size of the network becomes larger and
   larger as the traffic in the network keeps growing.

3.2.1.  Issues on Splitting Network into More Areas

   What would happen when we split a network with multiple areas into
   even more areas?

   1.  Significant Changes on Network Architecture

   The changes on network architecture are significant when a network
   with multiple areas is split into even more areas.  In the network
   before splitting, there is one backbone area, which is surrounded by
   a number of non backbone areas.  Each of the non backbone areas is
   connected to the backbone area.  There is not any direct connection
   between any two non backbone areas in general.

   Splitting the network into more areas is involved in re-arranging a
   number of routers and links to create new areas and make some of the
   existing areas to become smaller.  Some of the routers and links in a
   new area may be from the backbone area, and the other from some of
   the non backbone areas.

   In the network after splitting, there is still one backbone area,
   which must be changed and be surrounded by the new non backbone areas
   and the existing non backbone areas some of which have been changed.
   Each of the non backbone areas is connected to the backbone area.

   crossing multiple areas, we use PCEs to compute the path for the
   tunnel.  Thus more configurations for tunnel setup is needed.  We
   must configure PCEs for each of the new areas and peer relations
   among the PCEs for the new areas and the PCEs for the existing areas.

   3.  More Policy Configurations

   More policy configurations may be needed.  For each of the new non
   backbone areas and each of the existing non backbone areas that have
   been changed, some policies may need to be configured on the area
   border router connecting it to the backbone area to aggregate the
   routes in the non backbone area for transmission to the backbone
   area.

3.2.2.  Use of TTZ in Multi-Area Network

   The issues described above on splitting network into even more areas
   disappear if we do not split network into more areas and use OSPF TTZ
   instead.

   A TTZ may be applied to a group of routers and links in any area in
   the network directly.  For a group of routers and links connecting
   the routers in the group in an area, no matter where it resides in
   the area, we may configure it as an OSPF TTZ as long as each router
   in the group can reach the other routers in the group through those
   links.

   1.  No Significant Changes on Network Architecture

   We can see that there is not any significant change on network
   architecture when an OSPF TTZ is applied to a group of routers and
   links in an area in the network directly.

   At first, we do not add any new connection to the network, or remove
   any existing connection from the network.

   Secondly, every router outside of the TTZ is not aware of the TZZ.
   Even the router directly connecting to the TTZ is not aware of the
   TTZ.

   Furthermore, every router in the area still has a topology view of
   the area.  Except for those internal TTZ routers and links, which are
   hidden, every router outside of the TTZ has the link state
   information about all the routers and links in the area.

   2.  No Extra Configurations for Tunnel Setup

   After a group of routers and links in an area in the network is

Internet-Draft            Applicability of TTZ              October 2013


   configured as an OSPF TTZ, there is not any extra configuration for
   supporting setup of a MPLS TE tunnel.  We do not need to configure
   any new PCE since there is not any new area generated after applying
   a TTZ to a group of routers and links in an area.

   3.  No More Policy Configurations

   The architecture of areas is not changed after applying a TTZ to a
   group of routers and links in an area.  Thus there is no more policy
   configuration on the existing area border routers connecting existing
   non backbone areas to the existing backbone area to aggregate the
   routes in the non backbone area for transmission to the backbone area
   in general.

3.3.  Use of TTZ on Routers in POP

   A Point of Presence (POP) comprises the routers in a room, a floor, a
   building or a group of buildings.  These routers are normally in an
   AS or OSPF area.

   We may increase the network scalability significantly through
   configuring a POP as an OSPF TTZ.  When a POP becomes a TTZ, the link
   state information about every link and every router inside the POP is
   hidden from a router outside of the POP.  Only very small amount of
   link state information virtualizing the TTZ for the POP is
   distributed to the router outside of the POP.  Thus, the size of the
   LSDB on every router in the network is reduced significantly, and the
   speed for the router to compute the shortest path to every
   destination is increased dramatically.

   We may also improve the network availability when we use a TTZ for a
   POP.  In the case that a link or a router in the POP is down, the
   traffic may be interrupted without using any TTZ for the POP.  The
   link state information about the link or router down needs to be
   distributed to every router in the network, and every router needs to
   compute the shortest path to every destination and download the path
   to its FIB.  The traffic is forwarded according to the latest FIB on
   every router.  During this process, there may be inconsist views on
   the network topology on different routers.

   The traffic interruption is minimized if we use a TTZ for the POP.
   The link state information about the link or router down is hidden
   from every router outside of the POP, which is not aware of the link
   or router down in the POP.  Thus every router outside of the POP has
   the same topology view when the link or router is down.  It does not
   compute the shortest path or download the path to its FIB.

3.4.  Use of TTZ on Routers in IPRAN

   The IP RAN provides connectivity for IP-based mobile broadband (MBB)
   from LTE and 4G base stations.  The ratio of MBB subscribers to total
   mobile subscribers keeps growing fast.  It is expected to grow to
   nearly 40% in 2016 from 15% in 2011.

   At the end of 2012, China Mobile had deployed more than 500,000 nodes
   to support MBB services according to PTN Market Research 2013 Frost &
   Sullivan.  The size of the IP RAN network must seamlessly scale from
   tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of nodes.

   OSPF TTZ may be used in a big IP RAN network for reducing the
   partition of the network into more OSPF areas.  Thus, the network can
   smoothly scale to hundreds of thousands of nodes.  In addition, OSPF
   TTZ can make the operation and maintenance of the network easier.

3.5.  Use of TTZ on Routers from Same Vendor

   In a network, we may separate the routers from different vendors
   through using TTZ in order to alleviate the possible multi-vendor
   inter-operability issue.  For example, the routers from a same vendor
   can be configured as a TTZ, and the routers outside of this TTZ are
   developed by different vendors.

3.6.  Use of TTZ on Routers in a Power Saving Group

   A power saving group is a set of routers and links, wherein the
   routers are connected through the links and there is a redundant
   route or path from a router in the group to another router in the
   group.  The redundant path is within the group.  That is that every
   hop in the redundant path is within the group.

   In a power saving group, when the usage of a link within the group
   between two routers crosses a given threshold value for shutting down
   the link to save energy, the link will be shut down.  This link down
   in the power saving group will not be distributed to any router
   outside of the group.  The traffic outside of the group will not be
   affected by the link down inside the group.

   From the characteristics of a power saving group, we can see that a
   power saving group is very suitable to be configured as a TTZ.


4.  Limitations

   A topology transparent zone is within an OSPF area.  It can not be in
   more than one OSPF areas.
