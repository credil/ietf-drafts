Supporting Source-Multiplexing of the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)

                  draft-lennox-payload-ulp-ssrc-mux-00

Abstract

   The Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) Payload format for Generic
   Forward Error Correction (FEC), specified in RFC 5109, forbids
   transmitting FEC repair flows as separate sources in the same RTP
   session as the flows being repaired.  This document updates RFC 5109
   to lift that restriction, as long as the association between original
   and repair flows is properly signaled and negotiated.

1.  Introduction

   The Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] payload format for
   Generic Forward Error Correction (FEC) [RFC5109] defines two
   mechanisms by which the Forward Error Correction stream can be
   transmitted alongside the payload stream.  As defined in Section 14
   of that document, the packets can either be sent in separate SDP
   media streams, i.e. a separate RTP session, associated through the
   "FEC" semantics [RFC5956] of the SDP grouping framework [RFC5888]; or
   they can be sent in the same packets, in an [RFC2198] redundant
   coding.

   The payload format specifically says that "the FEC and the payload
   MUST NOT be multiplexed by SSRC into one single RTP session since
   they always have the same SSRC."  However, this constraint is only
   necessary as a consequence of the fact that [RFC5109] chose to use
   SSRC alignment to associate the payload and the repair streams sent
   in separate RTP sessions.  The mechanism described by which the
   forward error correction packets are used to reconstruct missing
   payload packets does not actually rely on this SSRC alignment
   property.  The "MUST NOT" results from the absence of any alternative
   mechanism by which payload and repair streams can be associated.

   The Source-Specific Media Attributes [RFC5576] specification defines
   an "ssrc-group" semantic, "FEC", which is designed to address this
   problem -- it allows endpoints to indicate, in SDP, the associations
   among source flows and repair flows within a single RTP session,
   through a similar mechanism to the [RFC5888] / [RFC5956] grouping of
   RTP sessions.

   However, [RFC5576] did not update the "MUST NOT" statement in
   [RFC5109], so the FEC ssrc-group semantics arguably cannot be used.
   This document fixes that oversight, updating [RFC5109] to clarify
   when SSRC-multiplexed payload and repair streams can be used.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.


3.  Change to RFC 5109

   This sentence, the final sentence of the third paragraph of section
   14.1 of [RFC5109]:

      In addition, the FEC and the payload MUST NOT be multiplexed by
      SSRC into one single RTP session since they always have the same
      SSRC.

   is updated instead to read:

      The FEC and the payload MAY also be multiplexed by SSRC into one
      single RTP session, with separate SSRC values, if the association
      between FEC and payload streams are communicated to all members of
      the session.  If SDP is used, this association MAY be communicated
      through the FEC ssrc-group semantic [RFC5576]; other mechanisms
      are also possible.  Receivers MUST NOT attempt to interpret FEC
      streams for which they do not have information to associate them
      with the corresponding payload streams.


4.  Other mechanisms

   The wording about "other mechanisms" in the previous section is
   designed to address the possibility that non-SDP mechanisms could
   also be used to associate FEC and payload streams.  Potential
   examples of this would be the BUNDLE
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation] or SRCNAME
   [I-D.westerlund-avtext-rtcp-sdes-srcname] proposals, if standardized.


5.  Security Considerations

   An attacker who could force a receiver to mis-associate payload
   streams and repair streams could potentially trick a receiver into
   mis-decoding streams.  Thus, the association between payload streams
   and repair streams MUST be integrity-protected with at least the same
   strength of security as the streams are themselves.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.
