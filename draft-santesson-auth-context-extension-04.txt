Abstract

   This document defines an extension to certificates according to
   [RFC5280]. The extension defined in this document holds data about
   how the certificate subject was authenticated by the Certification
   Authority who issued the certificate where this extension appears. 

   This document also defines one data structure for inclusion in this
   extension that designed to hold information when the subject is
   authenticated using a SAML assertion [SAML].

INTERNET DRAFT      Authentication Context Extension      March 11, 2013


1  Introduction

   The primary purpose of this document is to provide a mechanism that
   allows an application to understand information that express the
   identity of a subject in a certificate that is stored either in a
   subject field attribute, as a subject alternative name or in a
   subject directory attribute.

   This addresses some needs that may arise when issuing a certificate
   from an existing non-certificate based identity infrastructure where
   the certificate subject already has an authenticated identity
   composed of a set of attributes, or so called claims, that differ
   from the attributes that are commonly used to express the identity of
   a certificate subject.

   A typical scenario for this is when the source of user authentication
   and user identity is based on a SAML federation, where the subject
   presents a SAML assertion in exchange of a certificate that can be
   traced back to that subjects SAML assertion, both with regard to
   identity attributes and with regard to level of assurance with which
   the subject was authenticated by its Identity Provider.

   A reason to issue such certificate may arise if the subject needs a
   certificate to sign a document, where the Certification Authority is
   authenticating the user by means of a SAML assertion when issuing
   that signature certificate.

   If that signature certificate need to conform to certificate
   profiles, such as [RFC3739], then this certificate may have to use a
   separate set of attributes to express the subject identity, as well
   as different formats for the attribute value, than the set of
   attributes obtained from the SAML assertion.

   The extension defined in the document makes it possible to extract
   information about the authentication context applied when
   authenticating the subject for the purpose of issuing a certificate.
   This may include information such as:

     o  The Identity Provider which authenticated the subject.
     o  The level of assurance with which the subject was authenticated.
     o  The trust framework where this level of assurance was defined.
     o  A unique reference to the authentication instant
     o  A mapping table between the subject attributes obtained from the
        SAML assertion used to authenticate the subject, and the subject
        identity information placed in the issued certificate.

   One scenario where this information may be useful is when a user logs
   in to a service using SAML credentials, where the same user at some

INTERNET DRAFT      Authentication Context Extension      March 11, 2013


   stage is required to sign some information. The service may need to
   verify that the signature was created by the same user that logged on
   to the service. This is only possible today using out-of-band
   knowledge about the CA that issued the certificate and it's
   practices. This is is however hard to scale and maintain using a
   large number of service providers, identity providers and CAs.

   The defined extension provides better scalability since it only
   requires the service provider to maintain a list of trusted CA:s. All
   other information abut the relationship between the certificate
   subject, and the SAML authenticated subject is available in the
   certificate.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2  Deployment

   EDITORS NOTE:
      [This section provided information for better understanding the
      rationale of the extension. This section can be deleted is the
      document is published]

   The extension defined in this draft has been defined and deployed in
   the National Swedish Identity infrastructure Eid 2.0 which is based
   on SAML federated identity. The Swedish infrastructure will go live
   during 2013 and will provide secure identification of citizens in
   Swedish government services. A central requirement in these
   government services is to allow citizens to sign various documents,
   representing a wide range of declarations and applications.

   A central part of this infrastructure is therefore to use centralized
   signature services that allows citizens to sign using their SAML
   credentials. As service providers authenticate and understands user
   identities only under a SAML context within this national
   infrastructure, this extension allows Service Providers to determine
   whether a presented signature matches a particular user and whether
   it meets the security requirements of the service.

   Through information provided in this extension a service provider may
   for example get notice that the user logged on using one level of
   assurance, but presented a signature which certificate was issued
   using a certificate obtained using a lower level of assurance
   procedure, and thus reject the signature.

INTERNET DRAFT      Authentication Context Extension      March 11, 2013


   This extension is therefore fundamental to the function of the
   Swedish Eid 2.0 infrastructure.


2.  Authentication Context Extension Syntax

   The Authentication Context extension has the following syntax:

      AuthenticationContexts ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF
                                 AuthenticationContext

      AuthenticationContext ::= SEQUENCE {
          contextType     UTF8String,
          contextInfo     UTF8String OPTIONAL
      }


   This extension holds a sequence of AuthenticationContext information.
   When present, this extension MUST include at least one
   AuthenticationContext.

   The type of authentication context defined in AuthenticationContext
   is identified by the contextType which MUST contain a URI that
   identifies the context type as well as an XML Schema name space
   [Schema1] and [Schema2] for associated context information. The
   optional authentication context information is carried as an XML
   [XML] string in contextInfo in accordance with the identified XML
   Schema.

   The XML data format is used mainly to allow context information to be
   extracted and processed in applications that lacks ASN.1 processing
   capabilities. XML is easy to deserialize into various data objects
   both in application and web environments for further comparison with
   the characteristics of for example SAML authenticated sessions. 

   This extension MAY be marked critical.

   Applications which find an authentication context information type
   they do not understand MUST ignore it if the extension is non
   critical, and MUST reject the certificate if the extension is
   critical. If an application requires that an authentication context
   exist, and either the extension is absent or none of the provided
   authentication contexts can be used MUST fail validation of the end
   user certificate.

   This document defines one authentication context information type
   (Section 3) that is used to provide information about SAML based
   authentication of the subject as part of the certificate issuance

   process. Other documents can define other authentication context
   information types.


3  SAML Authentication Context Information

   The SAML Authentication context information provides a contextType
   type that can be used to carry information about SAML based
   authentication of the certified subject as part of the certificate
   issuance process.

   The data carried in this authentication context information type is
   identified by the following XML Schema name space:

      http://id.elegnamnden.se/auth-cont/1.0/saci

   When this URI is specified as contextType, then associated XML data
   MUST be provided in contextInfo 


3.1  contextInfo Data Structure

   The data provided in contextInfo SHALL contain UTF-8 encoded XML in
   accordance with the XML schema provided in Appendix B. The XML
   document string in contextInfo MUST NOT include an XML header. That
   is, the XML document string contains only the root element
   <SAMLAuthContext> with it's child elements <AuthContextInfo> and
   <IdAttributes>.

   The <AuthContextInfo> and <IdAttributes> elements are outlined in the
   following subsections.


3.1.1   AuthContextInfo Element

   The <AuthContextInfo> element MAY be present. This element contains
   the following attributes:

     IdentityProvider       (required): The SAML EntityID of the
                            Identity Provider which authenticated the
                            subject.
     AuthenticationInstant  (required): Date and time when the subject
                            was authenticated, expressed according to
                            section 3.3.
     AuthnContextClassRef   (required): A URI identifying the
                            AuthnContextClassRef that is provided in the
                            AuthnStatement of the Assertion that was
                            used to authenticate the subject. This URI

                            identifies the context and the level of
                            assurance associated with this instance of
                            authentication.
     AssertionRef           (optional): A unique reference to the SAML
                            Assertion
     ServiceID              (optional): An arbitrary identifier of the
                            service that verified the SAML assertion.

   The <AuthContextInfo> element may hold any number of child elements
   of type any (processContents="lax"), providing additional information
   according to local conventions. Any such elements MAY be ignored if
   not understood.

INTERNET DRAFT      Authentication Context Extension      March 11, 2013


3.1.2  IdAttributes Element

   The <IdAttributes> element MAY be present. This element holds a
   sequence of one or more <AttributeMapping> elements, where each
   <AttributeMapping> element holds mapping information about one
   certificate subject attribute or name form present in the
   certificate.

   Each <AttributeMapping> element MUST specify the following
   attributes:

     Type   A string holding one of the enumerated values "rdn", "san"
            or "sda", specifying the type of certificate attribute or
            name form for which mapping information is provided:

              "rdn"  Mapping information is provided for an attribute in
                     a Relative Distinguished Name located in the
                     subject field.
              "san"  Mapping information is provided for a name in the
                     Subject Alternative Name extension of the
                     certificate.
              "sda"  Mapping information is provided for an attribute in
                     the Subject Directory Attributes extension.

     Ref    A reference to the specific attribute or name field. This
            reference is dependent on the value of Type in the following
            way:

              "rdn"  REF holds a string representation of the OID of the
                     relative distinguished name attribute.
              "sda"  REF holds a string representation of the OID of the
                     subject directory attribute attribute.
              "san"  REF holds a string representation of the explicit
                     tag number of the Subject Alternative Name type
                     (e.g. "1" = e-mail address (rfc822Name) and "2" =
                     dNSName). If the SubjectAlternative name is an
                     otherName, then the Ref holds a string
                     representation of the OID defining the otherName
                     form.

            String representations of object identifiers (OID) in the
            Ref attribute MUST be represented by a sequence of integers
            separated by a period. E.g. "2.5.4.32". This string MUST NOT
            contain any white-space or line breaks. 

   Each <AttributeMapping> element MUST contain a <saml:Attribute>
   element as defined in [SAML]. This SAML attribute element MUST have a
   Name attribute (specifying its type), MAY have other attributes and

INTERNET DRAFT      Authentication Context Extension      March 11, 2013


   MAY have zero or more <saml:AttributeValue> child elements. A present
   SAML attribute with absent attribute value limits mapping to the type
   of SAML attribute that was used to obtain the value stored in the
   referenced certificate subject attribute or name form, without
   duplicating the actual attribute value.

   If an attribute value is present in the SAML attribute, then the
   value stored in the certificate in the referenced attribute or name
   form MAY differ in format and encoding from the present SAML
   attribute value. For example, a SAML attribute value can specify a
   country expressed as "Sweden" while this country value is stored in
   the certificate in a countryName attribute using the two letter
   country code "SE". 

   Several <AttributeMapping> elements MAY be present for the same
   certificate subject attribute or name form if the certificate
   contains multiple instances of this attribute or name form where
   their values were obtained from different SAML attributes. But in
   such case it is not defined which present subject attribute or name
   form that maps to which SAML attribute. A certificate using
   application MAY attempt to determine this by comparing attribute
   values stored in this extension with attribute or name values present
   in the certificate, but this specification does not define any
   explicit matching rules that would guarantee an unambiguous result.

   The <AttributeMapping> element may hold any number of child elements
   of type any (processContents="lax"), providing additional information
   according to local conventions. Any such elements MAY be ignored if
   not understood.

   Note: The <AttributeMapping> element is designed to provide mapping
         between SAML attributes and certificate subject attributes and
         name forms where there is a distinct and clear relationship
         between relevant SAML attributes and corresponding certificate
         attributes and name forms. This does not cover all aspects of
         complex mapping situations where e.g. more than one SAML
         attribute maps to the same certificate attribute or when
         structured multi valued attributes are split into a range of
         other attributes and name forms. Such complex mapping
         situations MAY be covered by extending this XML Schema or by
         defining a more versatile context information schema.

4  Security Considerations

   This extension allows a CA to outsource the process to identify and
   authenticate a subject to another trust infrastructure in a dynamic
   manner that may differ form certificate to certificate. Since the
   authentication context is explicitly declared in the certificate, one
   certificate may be issued with a lower level of assurance than
   another.

   This means that the relying party need to be aware of the certificate
   policy under which this CA operates in order to understand when the
   certificate provides a level of assurance with regard to subject
   authentication that is higher than the lowest provided level. A
   relying party that is not capable of understanding the information in
   the authentication context extension MUST assume that the certificate
   is issued using the lowest allowed level of assurance declared by the
   policy.

Appendix A - ASN.1 modules

   This appendix includes the ASN.1 modules for the Authentication
   Context extension.  Appendix B.1 includes an ASN.1 module that
   conforms to the 1998 version of ASN.1. Appendix B.2 includes an ASN.1
   module, corresponding to the module present in B.1, that conforms to
   the 2008 version of ASN.1. Although a 2008 ASN.1 module is  provided,
   the module in Appendix B.1 remains the normative module as per policy
   adopted by the PKIX working group for certificate related
   specifications.

Appendix B - SAML Authentication Context Info XML Schema

 This appendix section B.1 includes an XML Schema ([Schema1] and
 [Schema2]) for the SAML Authentication context information defined in
 section 3.

 IMPORTANT NOTE: The XML Schema in B.1 specifies a URL on row 9 and 10
                 to the SAML schemaLocation (http://docs.oasis-
                 open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-schema-assertion-
                 2.0.xsd), which is too long to fit into one row and
                 therefore contains a line-break. This line-break has to
                 be removed before this schema can be successfully
                 compiled.
