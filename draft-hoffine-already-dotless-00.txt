               Top-Level Domains that Are Already Dotless
                    draft-hoffine-already-dotless-00

Abstract

   Recent statements from the Internet Architecture Board and ICANN's
   Security and Stability Advisory Committee have discussed the problems
   that the DNS is likely to experience with top-level domains that have
   address records in them (so-called "dotless domains").  However,
   these statements spoke of the problem mostly as theoretical, when in
   fact there are such TLDs today.  This document lists the current
   dotless TLDs, and gives a script for finding them.  This document
   lists data about dotless TLDs, but does not address the policy and
   technology issues other than to point to the statements of others.

1.  Introduction

   In the past few years, well-respected groups have issued reports
   about top-level domains in the DNS that have address records in them
   (so-called "dotless domains").  The Security and Stability Advisory
   Committee (SSAC) of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
   Numbers (ICANN) issued a report called "Report on Dotless Domains" in
   February, 2012 [SAC053].  The Internet Architecture Board (IAB)
   issued a report called "Dotless Domains Considered Harmful"
   [IAB-DOTLESS] in July, 2013.

   Both of these documents consider the effects of dotless domains
   without describing the extent of their current deployment.  In order
   to help researchers determine the extent of the problems with dotless
   domains, this document lists the known dotless domains at the time of
   publication, and shows how researchers can find them in the future.

   At the time of this writing, many people have expressed a belief that
   ICANN prohibits all TLDs from being dotless.  That belief is not
   true.  ICANN has contracts or agreements with fewer than half of the
   TLDs: for example, only about 80 country-code TLDs have agreements
   with ICANN at the time this document is published [ICANN-CCTLDs].

2.  Current Dotless Domains

   The following shows the data found at the time of publication of this
   document.

2.1.  TLDs with A Records

   At the time this document is published, the following TLDs have A
   records.

   AC has address 193.223.78.210
   AI has address 209.59.119.34
   CM has address 195.24.205.60
   DK has address 193.163.102.24
   GG has address 87.117.196.80
   IO has address 193.223.78.212
   JE has address 87.117.196.80
   KH has address 203.223.32.21
   PN has address 80.68.93.100
   SH has address 193.223.78.211
   TK has address 217.119.57.22
   TM has address 193.223.78.213
   TO has address 216.74.32.107
   UZ has address 91.212.89.8
   VI has address 193.0.0.198
   WS has address 64.70.19.33


2.2.  TLDs with AAAA Records

   At the time this document is published, the following TLD has an AAAA
   record.

   DK has IPv6 address 2a01:630::40:b1a:b1a:2011:1


2.3.  TLDs with MX Records

   At the time this document is published, the following TLDs have MX
   records.  The SSAC report implies, but does not say, that MX records
   would cause a TLD to be considered dotless; the IAB report does not
   mention MX records at all.

3.  IANA Considerations

   The script in Appendix A relies on IANA continuing to publish a copy
   of the TLDs in the root zone at http://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-
   by-domain.txt.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document lists the known dotless domains; it does not express an
   opinion on whether or not there are security considerations with the
   existence of dotless domains.  The referenced IAB and SSAC reports
   discuss the opinions of the respective bodies on the security and
   stability considerations of dotless domains.

Appendix A.  Script for Finding Dotless Domains

   The following shell script was used for finding the data in this
   document.  The authors believe that this script will work correctly
   on a wide variety of operating systems, and will continue to do so in
   the foreseeable future.  As is customary in the current legal
   environment, the authors make no assurance that the script is correct
   or that the script will not cause damage on a system where it is run.

   The script checks each nameserver for each TLD instead of just doing
   a simple query because the nameservers for some of the TLDs have
   inconsistent data in them with respect to the records shown here.
