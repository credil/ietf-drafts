    Abstract 

       Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network-based centralized mobility 
       management protocol, which has many disadvantages for utilizing the 
       centralized anchor LMA. As networks are moving towards flat 
       architectures, a distributed approach is needed to PMIPv6. This 
       document defines a robust solution for PMIPv6-based distributed 
       mobility management which ensures the robustness by organizing the 
       distributed anchors (MAARs) into a Chord ring.

      1. Introduction 

       The current IP mobility protocols, which are either host-based like 
       Mobile IPv6 [1] or network-based like Proxy Mobile IPv6 [2], support 
       the mobility management via centralized anchors. In order to maintain 
       the IP session when MNs handover, the anchors are mainly responsible 
       for allocating home network prefixes to MNs, managing their locations 
       and intercepting as well as forwarding packets that are from or to 
       MNs. However, such centralized anchors lead to some obvious 
       shortcomings like sub-optimal routing, scalability problem, 
       considerable signaling cost and delay and so on. 

       As the networks are moving towards flat architecture, a distributed 
       approach is needed to avoid those disadvantages of centralized 
       mobility protocols. In this distributed scheme, there is no need for 
       any centralized anchors in the network while only distributed anchors 
       are deployed. Besides, it is not necessary to identify MNs by the 
       fixed home addresses or home network prefixes. Some related drafts 
       have been proposed, but there are not any schemes to guarantee the

       robustness for the distributed mobility management. In this document, 
       we propose a robust solution for PMIPv6-based distributed mobility 
       management. This solution ensures the robustness by organizing the 
       distributed anchors (MAARs) into a Chord ring. 

      2. Terminology 

       The following terms used in this document are defined in the Proxy 
       Mobile IPv6 specification [RFC5213]: 

             Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) 

             Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) 

             Mobile Node (MN) 

             Corresponding Node (CN) 

             Proxy Binding Update (PBU) 

             Proxy Binding Acknowledgment (PBA) 

        

       The following terms are defined and/or used in this document: 

          MAAR (Mobility Anchor and Access Router).  First IP hop routers 
       where the mobile nodes attach to. They provide an IPv6 prefix 
       (topologically anchored at the MAAR) to each attaching mobile node. 
       They also play the role of mobility managers for the IPv6 prefixes 
       they anchor. 

          M-MAAR (Managed Mobility Anchor and Access Router).  The MAAR that 
       manages all the path of the MN which is distributed assigned in the 
       Chord ring. 

       M-PBU (Managed PBU). The signaling message sent by MAAR to the M-MAAR. 
       It is used to register to M-MAAR for MN recording the MN's path. 

       M-PBA (Managed PBA). The signaling message sent back by M-MAAR to the 
       MAAR. It is used to register to M-MAAR for MN recording the MN's path.

      3. Description of the solution 

       The purpose of this solution is to provide robust distributed 
       mobility management based on PMIPv6. For this, it is assumed that 
       there are many MAARs in the management domain and that every MAAR has 
       a MAAR identifier that is similar to an MN-identifier specified in 
       RFC 4283 [3]. And every MAAR in this solution functions as both an 
       LMA for those MNs that are attached to it at the first hop, and a MAG 
       for those MNs that are connected to it while not attached at the 
       first hop. Therefore, there are not any centralized anchors in the 
       architecture of this solution. In addition, all MAARs in this 
       distributed management domain are organized into a Chord circle using 
       consistent hashing over MAAR identifiers [4][5]. Given the fact that 
       the Chord system distributes the information of value among nodes on 
       the ring, the failure of a MAAR only affects a very limited number of 
       MAARs in the Chord system, which indicate that this solution for 
       distributed mobility management based on PMIPv6 is robust. Moreover, 
       for a given MN, the M-MAAR that manages all the path of this MN in 
       the distributed management domain is configured by the network 
       administrator of the domain or by some algorithm and does not change 
       as long as the MN roams within the domain. The architecture of this 
       solution is shown in Figure 1.

       As stated above, which M-MAAR is configured and responsible for an MN 
       is unknown to other MAARs when this MN attaches to them. In order to 
       deal with this issue, we store (key, value) pairs at the MAARs by 
       using consistent hashing algorithm, where the key is the hash value 
       of an MN-identifier and the value is the IPv6 address of the M-MAAR 
       serving the corresponding MN. For a given MN, the IPv6 address of its 
       M-MAAR should be stored at the MAAR that is the successor of the MN-
       identifier. For ease of description, we define QServer(MN) as the 
       MAAR that stores the (key, value) pair for an MN. Also for simplicity, 
       we will use MN-id and M-MAAR or the tuple (MN-id, M-MAAR) to 
       represent both the original and hash value of the MN-identifier and 
       the IPv6 address of its M-MAAR. 

       Whenever a new MAAR detects the attachment of an MN, it may not know 
       the MN's M-MAAR. In this case, it sends a query message including the 
       MN-identifier, the new MAAR's identifier and IPv6 address to the 
       Chord system in order to find the MN's M-MAAR. The other MAARs in the 
       Chord system forward the query message according to their finger 
       tables until it reaches QServer(MN). When the MAAR that serves as the 
       QServer of the MN receives the query message, it sends the IPv6 
       address of the MN's M-MAAR which is defined in the tuple (MN-id, M-
       MAAR) back to the new MAAR. When the new MAAR receives the IPv6 
       address of the MN's M-MAAR, it stores the M-MAAR's IPv6 address into 
       a table for the attached MN locally. 

       After knowing the M-MAAR's IPv6 address, the new MAAR (MAAR1) sends 
       an M-PBU message to the M-MAAR. If the cache about the MN in M-MAAR 
       is empty, this MAAR1 will also serve as LMA assigning HNP1 for MN as 
       specified in PMIPv6. And also, the M-MAAR should record one item 
       including MN-identifier, HNP1 and the IPv6 address of the MAAR1. 
       However, if there is one item (MN-id, HNP0, the MAAR0's IPv6 address) 
       in the cache about the MN in M-MAAR, the M-MAAR will return an M-PBA 
       message containing the corresponding information to the MAAR1 after 
       receiving the M-PBU message. That is, MAAR1 is not the first hop 
       router to which the MN accesses. And then MAAR1 sends a register 
       message (PBU) to the MAAR0 and establishes the bi-directional tunnel 
       between the MAAR0 and the MAAR1 after receiving the PBA message from 
       the MAAR0. Besides, in this case the MN could also use the HNP1 
       allocated by MAAR1 to start a new IP session. 

       As shown in Figure 2, the paths among the MAARs and the M-MAAR 
       represented by lines ("/" and "\") indicate registrations between 
       MAARs and the M-MAAR, while the path depicted with stars ("*") 
       denotes the query procedure of MAARs for the address of the M-MAAR of 
       the MN-id in chord ring, and the path pictured with circles ("o" and 
       "#") shows the data flow from CN1 and CN2 respectively. In Figure 2, 
       the MN moves from the MAAR1 to the MAAR2. And the MN starts a new

       session with the CN2 when it moves to the MAAR2 and also continues 
       the session with the CN1 through the MAAR1. The detailed procedure is 
       described in Figure 3.

       D flag 

       1-bit "Distributed" flag is used to identify whether this PBU is from 
       the MAAR to the M-MAAR. When this flag is set to "0", this message is 
       the PBU message in the [RFC5213]. If the flag is set to "1", this 
       message is the M-PBU. The flag MUST be set to the value of 1 in this 
       draft.
