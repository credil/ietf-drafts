1. Introduction 

   A Path Computation Element (PCE) is an entity (component, 
   application or network node) that is capable of computing a network 
   path or route based on a network graph and applying computational 
   constraints. An architecture for the use of PCEs is defined in 
   [RFC4655].

   The Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) is defined in [RFC5440] 
   to exchange path computation requests and responses between Path 
   Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs. It is also used between 
   cooperating PCEs. 

   Path computations performed by a PCE depend on a set of constraints 
   indicated by the PCC. These constraints include the end points of 
   the path to compute (source and destination), and may include other 
   simple constraints such as bandwidth requirements and metric maxima 
   (for example, a maximum threshold for the hop count or the TE metric 
   of the computed path). 

   The PCE also needs to use some objective function to qualify the 
   path it selects as meeting the requirements of the PCC. The PCE may 
   have a default objective function, but the PCC can also indicate 
   which objective function it wants applied by placing an Objective 
   Function object in the path computation request message [RFC5541]. A 
   core set of objective functions to be supported in PCEP messages is 
   defined in the base PCEP requirements [RFC4657], and [RFC5541] 
   defines each of these functions as an abstract formula. 

   The registry of codepoints used to indicate objective functions is 
   managed by IANA and can be extended in future documents. PCE 
   implementations may choose to offer proprietary, vendor-specific 
   objective functions, and there is scope for this within the 
   codepoint registry created by [RFC5541]. That is, in the "PCE 
   Objective Function" code point registry managed by IANA, the rules 
   for the assignment of objective function code point values are as 
   follows (using terms defined in [RFC5226]) 

   o Function code values 1 through 1023 are assigned by IANA using the 
   "IETF Review" policy. 

   o Function code values 1024 through 32767 are assigned by IANA, 
   using the "First Come First Served" policy. 

   o Function code values in the range 32768-65535 are for "Private 
   Use". 

   Proprietary objective functions may operate on non-standard 
   constraints or metrics. The PCEP Metric Object defined in [RFC5440] 
   has scope for the definition of new, standardized metrics, but no 
   facility for the definition of vendor-specific metrics. At the same 
   time, there is no mechanism in PCEP for carrying other, more complex, 
   vendor-specific constraints.

   This document defines a new PCEP object, the Vendor Constraints 
   object that can be used to carry arbitrary constraint information.  

   This document also defines a new PCEP TLV, the VENDOR-CONSTRAINT-TLV 
   that can be used to carry arbitrary constraint information within an 
   existing PCEP object.  

    

2. Procedures  

   A PCC that wants to convey proprietary or vendor-specific 
   constraints or metrics to a PCE does so by including a Vendor 
   Constraints object in the PCReq message. The contents and format of 
   the object are described in Section 3, but it is important to note 
   that the object includes an Enterprise Number that is a unique 
   identifier of an organization responsible for the definition of the 
   content and meaning of the object. 

   A PCC that wants to convey endpoints-specific vendor specific 
   constraints to a PCE may do so by including a Vendor Constraints TLV 
   in the endpoint-restriction-list of the END-POINTS with object type 
   Generalized Endpoint.   

   This Vendor Constraints TLV MAY also present in PCEP Objects 
   supporting TLVs and using the registry for the PCEP TLVs, to 
   indicate a vendor-specific constraint that applies to the PCEP 
   object.  

   A PCE that receives a PCReq message containing a Vendor Constraints 
   object MUST act according to the P-bit in the object header. That is, 
   if the P-bit is set, the object MUST be treated as mandatory and the 
   request must either be processed using the contents of the object or 
   rejected as defined in [RFC5440]. If the P-bit is clear, the object 
   MAY be used by the PCE or MAY be ignored. The PCC sets the P-bit 
   according to how it wishes the request to be processed. 

   The PCE determines how to interpret the Vendor Constraints object or 
   TLV by examining the Enterprise Number it contains. 

   The Vendor Constraints object is optional in a PCReq message. 
   Multiple instances of the object MAY be used on a single PCReq 
   message and each MUST be treated according to its P-bit setting. The 
   object can be present in two places within the PCReq message to 
   enable it to apply to a single path computation request or to a set 
   of synchronized requests. This usage mirrors the usage of the 
   Objective Function object [RFC5541]. Thus, the PCReq message based

   The Vendor Constraints object is included in a PCRep message in 
   exactly the same way as any other object as defined in [RFC5440]. 

   The Vendor Constraints TLV is optional in the END-POINTS with object 
   type Generalized Endpoint. The vendor restriction TLV MAY be 
   inserted at any place in the endpoint-restriction-list.  

   The VENDOR-CONSTRAINT-TLV MUST be taken into account. If the P flag 
   of the containing object is set, but the PCE does not understand the 
   TLV and its enterprise number, the entire PCEP message MUST be 
   rejected and the PCE MUST send a PCErr message with Error-
   Type="Reception of an invalid object" and Error-Value="Unsupported 
   VENDOR-CONSTRAINT-TLV" along with the corresponding object.  

   When present in the END-POINTS with object type Generalized Endpoint 
   the endpoint-restriction-list is encoded as follow: 

   <endpoint-restriction> ::= 
                            <LABEL-REQUEST><label-restriction-list>| 
                            <VENDOR-CONSTRAINT-TLV>]| 
3. Protocol Elements  

   The Vendor Constraints object and TLV conform to the format for PCEP 
   objects and TLVs defined in [RFC5440].  

   VENDOR-CONSTRAINT Object-Class is to be assigned by IANA 
   (recommended value=23). 

    VENDOR-CONSTRAINT Object-Type is to be assigned by IANA 
   (recommended value=1) 

   VENDOR-CONSTRAINT-TLV Type is to be assigned by IANA (recommended 
   value=16) 

   The format of the VENDOR-CONSTRAINT object, VENDOR-CONSTRAINT-TLV 
   body is as follows: 

      0                   1                   2                   3

   Enterprise Number 

   A unique identifier of an organization encoded as a 32-bit integer. 
   Enterprise Numbers are assigned by IANA and managed through an IANA 
   registry [RFC2578]. 

   Enterprise-Specific Information 

   The detailed enterprise-specific constraint information carried by 
   the object. The format and interpretation of this information is a 
   matter for the enterprise identified by the Enterprise Number. Such 
   formats and interpretation MAY be published by the enterprise 
   (possibly through an informational RFC or through commercial 
   documentation) so that PCCs or PCEs that are not part of the 
   organization can use the information. 

4. IANA Considerations 

   IANA maintains a registry of PCEP parameters. This includes sub-
   registry for PCEP Objects and PCEP TLV Type Indicators. 

   IANA is requested to make an allocation from the sub-registry PCEP 
   Objects as follows. The values here are suggested for use by IANA. 

    
   Object        Name                                  Reference Class

draft-ietf-pce-vendor-constraints-05.txt                  December 2011 
    

5.1. Control of Function and Policy 

   A PCEP implementation SHUOLD allow configuring of various parameters 
   as described in [RFC5440]. A PCC implementation that uses vendor- 
   specific constraints MAY make the use of these constraints 
   configurable either across the whole PCC, per PCE that the PCC uses, 
   or per path computation request. A PCE that supports vendor-specific 
   constraints MAY make the support of these constraints configurable, 
   and MAY allow configuration of policies for the use of the 
   constraints.  

5.2. Information and Data Models 

   A PCEP MIB module is defined in [PCE-MIB] that describes managed 
   objects for modeling of PCEP communications. 

   It is NOT RECOMMENDED that standard MIB modules are extended to 
   include detailed information about the content of the Vendor 
   Constaints object. However, the standard MIB module MAY be extended 
   to report the use of the Vendor Specific object and the Enterprise 
   Numbers that the objects contain.  

5.3. Liveness Detection and Monitoring 

   This document makes no change to the basic operation of PCEP and so 
   there are no changes to the requirements for liveness detection and 
   monitoring set out in [RFC4657] and [RFC5440]. 

5.4. Verifying Correct Operation 

   This document makes no change to the basic operation of PCEP and so 
   there are no changes to the requirements or techniques for 
   monitoring the correct operation of the protocol out in [RFC4657] 
   and [RFC5440]. 

   Note that "correct operation" in this context referes to the 
   operation of the protocol itself, and not to the operation of the 
   computation algorithms which are out of scope for all PCEP work. 
   Mechanisms for verifying the correct operation of computation 
   algorithms might involve comparing the results returned by more than 
   one PCE. Scope for this might be limited by the use of vendor 
   constraints unless multiple PCEs support the same set of constraints. 

5.5. Requirements on Other Protocols and Functional Components 

   This document does not place any new requirements on other network 
   components or protocols. However, it may be beneficial to consider 
 
 
Farrel & Zhang            Expires June 2012                   [Page 8] 

draft-ietf-pce-vendor-constraints-05.txt                  December 2011 
    

   whether a PCE should advertise the enterprise numbers and vendor 
   constraints it supports. This advertisement could be within PCE 
   Discovery ([RFC5088], [RFC5089]) or through extensions to PCEP 
   [RFC5440]. 

   Extensions for discovery and advertisement are outside the scope of 
   this document. 

5.6. Impact on Network Operation 

   The availability of vendor constraints in PCEP messages may 
   facilitate more complex and detailed path computations that may 
   enhance the way in which the network is operated. 

   On the other hand, the presence of additional vendor-specific 
   information in PCEP messages may congest the operation of the 
   protocol especially if the PCE does not support the constraints 
   supplied by the PCC. Thus, a PCC SHOULD monitor the capabilities of 
   a PCE either by discovery mechanisms as described in Section 5.5, or 
   through the receipt of negative responses. A PCC SHOULD NOT include 
   vendor constraints in a PCReq message to a PCE that it believes does 
   not support the constraints and that will not forward the request to 
   some other PCE that does support the constraints. 

6. Security Considerations 

   The protocol extensions defined in this document do not 
   substantially change the nature of PCEP. Therefore, the security 
   considerations set out in [RFC5440] apply unchanged. 

   Operators should note that an attack on PCEP may involve making PCEP 
   messages as large as possible in order to consume bandwidth and 
   processing power. The Vendor Constraints object may provide a 
   mechanism for this type of attack. It may be protected against by 
   using the authentication and integrity procedures described in 
   [RFC5440].
