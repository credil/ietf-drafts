             Tracking of Static/Autoconfigured IPv6 addresses
          draft-asati-dhc-ipv6-autoconfig-address-tracking-00.txt


Abstract

   Network operators commonly use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
   (DHCP) to assign IP addresses to the hosts, and track them. However,
   the tracking capability is lost when stateless autoconfiguration or
   manual methods are used to assign IPv6 addresses.

   This document proposes a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for
   IPv6 (DHCPv6) based mechanism that the last hop router can use to
   convey the hosts' IPv6 addresses for the tracking and logging
   purposes, without requiring any changes to the hosts.

1. Introduction

   As network operators leverage SLAAC (Stateless Address auto
   configuration) [RFC4862] or static methods to assign the IPv6
   address to the hosts (e.g. subscribers/users), they can no longer
   track or figure out which IPv6 address is used by which host. This
   potentially impacts the operator's operational aspects (e.g.


Asati, et al.            Expires July 2, 2013                  [Page 2]

Internet-Draft  Static/Stateless IPv6 Address Tracking     January 2013


   subscriber management) and forces the operators to postpone the IPv6
   roll-out until all the hosts can support DHCPv6 [RFC3315].

     Note that the operators rely on DHCP server's lease assignments to
     keep track of IP address assigned to hosts by creating the mapping
     of MAC address and IP address(es) pertaining to each host. This
     assumes DHCP support on the hosts, of course.

   This document describes a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
   version 6 (DHCPv6) mechanism that the first hop router (or switch)
   can use to convey the IPv6 addresses obtained by the hosts using
   stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [RFC4862] or static
   methods, to the DHCPv6 server for tracking and/or logging purposes.

   This document does NOT propose any changes to the hosts.



2. Terminology

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

3. Scope

   This document caters to the following sample network topology that
   could be mapped to a residential broadband network topology or
   enterprise network topology or data center.



   Host11-----Node11-------Network-------Router2-----DHCP Server(s)
   Host12------//              |
   Host13=======---Node12------|

                          Figure 1 Sample Network



   The above topology could be illustrated a bit differently in figure
   2 -

   Host11----CE11-----PE11---Network----Router2-----DHCP Server(s)
   Host12------//              |
   Host13=======------PE12-----|

                             Figure 2 Network

   In case of residential broadband homes, CE11 could be a residential
   gateway (RGW) or CPE router, whereas PE11 could be a Broadband
   Network Gateway (BNG) or Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS) or
   3GPP Packet Data Network (PDN) Gateway aka PGW.

   In case of enterprise network, CE11 could be a Customer Edge Router
   or Switch connecting to the hosts.

   CE11 could also be dubbed as the requesting router.



4. Protocol Operation

   This section describes the protocol operation in terms of changes
   needed on Host, router and DHCP server.

4.1. Host Behavior

   This document assumes hosts' support for [RFC4861], and does not
   require any changes to the host behavior.

   Per [RFC4861], a host MUST perform Neighbor Discovery and Router
   Discovery as soon as IPv6 is enabled on any of its interfaces. As
   part of Neighbor Discovery, a host must perform DAD for each of the
   IPv6 addresses (unless interface-identifier is negotiated to be
   unique, as may be the case with IPv6 over PPP [RFC5072]).

     A host can have one or more IPv6 addresses belonging to one or
     more prefixes that it learned dynamically (i.e. SLAAC) [RFC4862]
     or statically.



4.2. Router Behavior

   The router that is connected to the hosts via zero or more layer2
   switches maintains the neighbor cache, which comprises of one or
   more bindings between host's identifier (e.g. MAC address,
   interface-identifier etc.) and assigned IPv6 addresses.



Asati, et al.            Expires July 2, 2013                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft  Static/Stateless IPv6 Address Tracking     January 2013


   This is true even if the host to host communication does not involve
   the first-hop router (assuming one or more layer2 switches between
   router and hosts).

   The router periodically exports these bindings pertaining to IPv6
   GUA [RFC4291] and/or ULA [RFC4193] using the RECORD_CLIENTBINDING
   message to the DHCPv6 server. The periodicity is decided by the
   lift-time of each neighbor cache entry.

   When the router deletes one or more neighbor cache entries for
   whatever reason (e.g. host disconnected), it notifies the DHCP
   server using the RECORD_CLIENTBINDING message with lifttime of zero
   for the relevant clients. The server may decide to purge those
   entries.

   The router expects the acknowledgement from the server in form of
   RECORD-CLIENTBINDING-ACK to ensure that the message was delivered.
   This is in accord with rest of the DHCPv6 messages.



4.3. DHCP Server Behavior

   The DHCP sever, upon receiving the RECORD-CLIENTBINDING message,
   records the binding between host's identifier (e.g. MAC address) and
   IPv6 address(es). DHCP server also records the identity of the
   router that sent the RECORD-CLIENTBINDING message for a given
   client.

   The DHCP server sends RECORD-CLIENTBINDING-ACK message to the router
   to acknowledge the receipt of the router sent information.

   Each binding is maintained with a lifetime and is expected to be
   refreshed prior to the expiration. If the server does not receive a
   RECORD-CLIENTBINDIG message prior to expiration, then the server
   deletes that binding.
