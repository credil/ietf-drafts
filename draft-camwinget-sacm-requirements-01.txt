1.  Introduction

   Today's challenges of evolving threats and improved analytics to
   address such threats highlight a need to automate the securing of
   both information and the systems that store, process and trasmit the
   information.  SACM's charter focuses on addressing some of these
   challenges in a narrower scope by bounding the task to address use
   cases that pertain to the posture assessment of endpoints.

   This document focuses on describing the requirements for facilitating
   the exchange of posture assessment information, in particular, for
   the use cases as exemplified in [I-D.ietf-sacm-use-cases].

2.  Terminology

   Currently defined in [I-D.dbh-sacm-terminology].

3.  Requirements

   As the group continues to define an architecture and use cases, some
   requirements can already be formed and be used to evolve the
   architecture as well.  This section describes the requirements used
   by the SACM WG to assess and compare candidate information models and
   protocols to suit the architecture.  These requirements express
   characteristics or features that a candidate protocol or data model
   must be capable of offering so as to ensure security and
   interoperability.

3.1.  Reference Architecture Model

   Until a richer architecture is agreed upon, the requiremens are
   predicated on the following model:




               +--------+             +-----------+              +---------------------+
               | Asset  | <....A....> | Evaluator | <....B....>  | Assessment Consumer |

               +--------+            +-------------+                         |
                                     | Repository  |                         |

                                                                             |
                                 +--------------------+                      |
                                 | Posture Assessment |<---------------------+
                                 |     Repository     |
                                 +--------------------+




                        Simple Architectural Model

   The Architectural Model shown above demonstrates:

   o  Asset: is the endpoint of interest that is posture validated.

   o  Evaluator: is the service that affects the posture assessment and
      stores the posture result into a repository.

   o  Repository: is the storage component bound to the Evaluator that
      contains the posture assessment information.

   o  Posture Assessment Repository: is another type of repository that
      holds posture assessment information.  While not bound to the
      Evaluator, it is another source of posture assessment information
      (e.g. a data aggregation point aggregating posture assessment with
      other attributes) that can provide information to serve SACM use
      cases.

   o  Assessment Consumer: is the service that requires the posture
      assessments information of one or more assets.

   Using this architectural reference model, the interfaces, data models
   and transports used to affect the posture assessment, e.g. A in the

   figure above have already been defined by different mechanisms, for
   example, an IETF defined one through NEA.  As the focus of SACM is
   the information exchange to obtain the posture assessment
   information, it can be achieved through the interfaces shown as B.
   That is, it is not clear that there is a requirement for the
   Assessment Consumer to tap directly into the Repository.  Similarly,
   it is not clear that SACM is chartered to define the interfaces and
   data model for how an Evaluator stores and transports the assessment
   results to the Repository.  Thus, the focus of the requirements will
   revolve around the data models, protocols and transports for B, the
   communication of posture assessment from an Evaluator to an
   Assessment Consumer.

3.2.  Data Model requirements

   With the use cases spanning the need to collect, verify and update
   information about posture assessment, the set of high level
   requirements for the data model include:



    Extensibility

       Posture Assessment includes the posture attributes relating to
       the asset configuration but its observed status as well.  The use
       cases already articulate the many different means in which such
       configuration may be queried and will evolve over time.  With the
       explosion of different assets evolving and means in which the
       assets are used and configured, the data model must be extensible
       to allow for the support of these new upcoming attributes.

    Agility

       Considerations for the lightweight representation for these
       attributes and the tools used to consume the information will be
       required.  Use cases, especially in the vulnerability assessment
       and threat defense applications require time criticality in both
       obtaining the information as well as consuming (e.g. parsing).
       The agility requirement is to ensure that the data model and its
       implementations are suitable to fit in different deployment
       models and scenarios.

    Standards representation

       While it is presumed that we can leverage from standards, the
       data model must also adhere to Internationalization especially of
       display strings where applicable.

    Interoperability

       To ensure a globalized and interoperable standard, it is
       understood that a minimum set of terms and attributes are defined
       to address the use cases defined, the expected set of posture
       assessments (including the expected posture configuration) and
       potential state or assertions.

3.3.  Architectural Design Tenets

   The protocol requirements must account for different network topology
   scenarios to ensure that the information can be (securely) routed.
   With the focus of enabling the communication of posture assessment
   information, different scenarios must also be accounted for to
   address the use cases.  The architectural model design tenets or
   requirements incude:



    Discovery

       To address the availability of posture assessment from different
       Evaluators that may support different interface (or data model)
       versions, a discovery mechanism may be introduced by which
       Posture assement Evaluators and Consumers can be registered with
       their capabilities (e.g. version support) clearly defined.

    Many to Many

       The architectural model for designing the security and transport
       must account for a many-to-many connections.  It is expected that
       an Assessment Consumer may probe, request and consume Posture
       assessment information from various Evaluators.  Similarly,
       Evaluators will be providing their Posture assessment information
       to many Assessment Consumers.

    Asynchronous updates or notifications

       Assessment Consumers such as Firewalls or Intrusion Prevention
       Systems will require realtime notifications especially of posture
       assessment updates.">

    Bulk Updates

       Just as there is a need to recieve timely updates of Posture
       Assessment information, there are applications where Assessment
       Consumers will require full state information of an Evaluator's
       Posture Assessment repository.  As such, the repository may be

       very large based on both the number of assets and historical
       information stored by that Evaluator's Posture Assessment
       Repository; e.g. bulk synchronization or updates will be
       required.">

    Support for varied network deployments

       As applications defined in the use cases may be deployed in
       different enterprise scenarios, an enterprise's network
       deployment may vary and must be taken into account.  In a simple
       enterprise scenario, an application may be expected to sit in the
       same internet domain; however, in today's enterprise, the
       application, while still part of the enterprise, may be in a
       different internet domain or hosted on a private cloud.  As such,
       the transport must account that there data delivery may be
       feasible in different OSI transport layers and in some cases, may
       be over a limited bandwidth connection.

4.  Security Requirements

   This section describes security requirements as needed to address the
   mechanisms that facilitate secure exchange of posture assessment
   information.

   o  Authentication: all services or entities that either provide or
      consume the information must be authenticated to ensure that only
      authorized entities can request or provide the posture assessment
      information.

   o  Anti-replay: if the Assessment Consumer recieves the same exact
      message twice (e.g. because an attacker has re-intected the
      message), it must be detectable and the Assessment Consumer must
      reject the replayed message.

   o  Confidentiality: it should not be possible for any entity other
      than the targetted Assessment Consumer to read the message.
