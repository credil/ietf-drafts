1.  Introduction

   An integral part of the success and adoption of the Real-Time
   Communications Web (RTC-WEB) will be the interoperability between
   RTC-Web applications.  This specification will focus on the media
   transport requirements for RTC-Web client applications.

   The media transport requirements fit into a series of specifications
   have been created to address RTC-Web negotiation and signaling
   protocols, security requirements, non-media data transmission and use
   cases.  More information on the RTC-Web can be found here:

   [TODO put links to supporting drafts here]


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Real-Time Media Transport Requirements

   This section defines the real-time media transport requirements for
   RTC-Web client application implementation.  This section breaks down
   the RTC-WEB RTP requirements into several sections.  The sections
   cover the RTP requirements for: profile, optimizations, extensions,
   transport robustness and rate control.

   [OPEN ISSUE: identify missing requirements]

3.1.  RTP Profile

   RTC-Web applications to will need to provide a secure, interoperable,
   bandwidth friendly, media transport profile.  The Secure Audio-visual
   Profile Feedback (SAVPF) as defined in [RFC5124] will meet the needs
   of RTC-Web applications by providing media encryption,
   interoperability and a flexible, bandwidth conscious RTCP packet
   transmission model.  All RTC-Web applications are REQUIRED to
   implement SAVPF.  Requiring the implementation of SAVPF also means
   that RTC-Web applications MUST implicitly support Audio-visual
   Profile Feedback (AVPF) [RFC4585], Audio-visual Profile (AVP)
   [RFC3551] and Secure Audio-visual Profile (SAVP) [RFC3711].

3.1.1.  Profile Encryption Mechanism

   SAVPF supports SRTP by providing media encryption, integrity
   protection, replay protection and a limited form of source
   authentication.  Though the SAVPF profile does support secure media
   transport, it does not specify an encryption keying mechanism.  To
   support keying for SRTP, WEB-RTC application implementors are
   REQUIRED to implement DTLS-SRPT [RFC5764].

3.2.  RTP Optimizations

   This section describes the optimization requirements for RTP within
   RTC-Web applications.

3.2.1.  RTP and RTCP Multiplexing

   Historically, RTP and RTCP have been run on separate UDP ports.  With
   the increased use of Network Address Port Translation (NAPT) so have
   the problems increased for maintaining multiple, costly NAT bindings
   for each UDP port.  This dual UDP port paradigm also complicates
   firewall administration, since multiple ports must be opened to allow
   for RTP traffic.  To reduce these costs and session setup times,
   support for multiplexing multiple RTP streams on a single UDP port
   [I-D.rosenburg-jennings-rtp-mux] is REQUIRED.

   Note that the use of RTP and RTCP multiplexed on a single port
   ensures that there is occasional traffic sent on that port, even if
   there is no active media traffic.  This may be useful to keep-alive
   NAT bindings.

3.2.2.  Reduced-Size RTCP

   RTCP packets are usually sent as compound RTCP packets and [RFC3550]
   demands that the RTCP compound packets always start with a Sender
   Report (SR) or Receiver Report (RR) packet.  The SR and RR packets
   provide reception quality statistics and increase the mean RTCP
   packet size.  Because the mean compound RTCP packet size is larger,
   the frequency at which RTCP packets can be sent within the RTCP
   bandwidth share decreases.  The decreased transmission frequency
   creates a performance bottleneck that is especially noticeable when
   using frequent feedback messages.

   As mentioned in section [Add ref] RTC-Web applications will be
   required to implement SAVPF, which implicitly requires feedback.
   [RFC5506] specifies how to reduce the mean RTCP message and allow for
   more frequent feedback.  Frequent feedback, in turn, is essential to
   make real-time application quickly aware of changing network
   conditions and allow them to adapt their transmission and encoding

   behavior.  Support for [RFC5506] is REQUIRED

3.2.3.  Symmetric RTP/RTCP

   RTP entities choose the RTP and RTCP transport addresses (IP
   addresses and port numbers), to bind to and receive packets on.
   However when sending RTP and RTCP packets, senders may use an IP
   address or port number that is different than the one specified for
   receiving packets.  Using different transport addresses is
   problematic with regards to NAT traversal.  The NAT traversal problem
   can be alleviated using symmetric RTP/RTCP [RFC4961].  Symmetric RTP/
   RTCP requires that the transport addresses for sending and receiving
   RTP/RTCP packets are identical.  All RTC-WEB client applications are
   REQUIRED to implement Symmetric RTP/RTCP [RFC4961].

3.2.4.  CNAME Generation

   The RTCP Canonical Name (CNAME) provides a persistent transport-level
   identifier for an RTP endpoint.  While the Synchronization Source
   (SSRC) identifier for an RTP endpoint may change if a collision is
   detected, or when the RTP application is restarted, it's RTCP CNAME
   is meant to stay unchanged, so that RTP endpoints can be uniquely
   identified and associated with their RTP media streams.  For proper
   functionality, RTCP CNAMEs should be unique within the participants
   of an RTP session.

   The RTP specification [RFC3550] includes guidelines for choosing a
   unique RTP CNAME.  These guidelines are not sufficient in the
   presence of NAT devices or with regards to addressing privacy
   concerns resulting from the long-term, persistent identifiers.

   To address the shortcomings of CNAME selection in[RFC3550], it is
   RECOMMENDED that RTP CNAME generation follows the approach specified
   in section 5 of [RFC6222].

   For RTC-WEB client applications, such as a web browser, it may not be
   possible to retrieve the EUI-64 identifier or the host system's MAC
   address which is needed to fulfill the CNAME generation procedure
   outlined in section 5 of [RFC6222].  As an alternative to the EUI-64/
   MAC address, RTC-WEB client applications MAY generate and use a
   random number for the unique CNAME generation procedure.

3.3.  RTP Extensions

   This section describes the RTP extensions that could be very useful
   within the RTC-WEB context.

3.3.1.  Conferencing Extensions

   RTC-Web applications will support conferencing capabilities.  While
   this document remains silent regarding what conferencing topology
   should be supported for RTC-Web applications, the following section
   will provide guidance around RTP extensions to support centralized
   conferencing.

   For more information on RTP conferencing topologies please refer to
   [RFC5117]

3.3.1.1.  FIR RTCP Feedback Message

   The Full Intra Request (FIR) command and message are defined in
   sections 3.5.1 and 4.3.1 of [RFC5104].  FIR messages will request
   that the currently distributed session participants send new intra
   coded pictures to the mixer.  FIR is used when switching between
   sources to ensure that the receivers can decode the video or other
   predicted media encoding with long prediction chains.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that the FIR message is supported.

3.3.1.2.  PLI RTCP Feedback Message

   The Picture Loss Indicator (PLI) is defined in Section 6.3.1 of
   [RFC4585].  PLI messages tell the encoder that a receiver has lost
   the decoder context and would like it repaired.  It is RECOMMENDED
   that the PLI message is supported.

3.3.1.3.  TMMBR RTCP Feedback Message

   The Temporary Maximum Media Stream Bit Rate Request (TMMBR, "timber")
   message is defined in sections 3.5.4 and 4.2.1 of [RFC5104].  A
   receiver, translator, or mixer uses the TMMBR to request a sender to
   limit the maximum bit rate for a media stream to, or below, the
   provided value.  An example of using TMMBR would be for an RTP mixer
   to constrain the media sender's bit rate to fit within the lower bit
   rate range of other session participants.  It is RECOMMENDED that the
   TMMBR message be supported.

3.3.2.  Header Extensions

   This section describes the requirements for RTC-WEB RTP header
   extensions.  For all RTC-WEB RTP header extensions it is REQUIRED
   that they are formatted and signaled according to the general
   mechanism defined in [RFC5285].

   [Open Issue: should any of the following headers be added to the
   list:

   o  Transmission time offsets[RFC5450]

   o  Associating time-codes with RTP streams [RFC5484] [Remove?]

3.3.2.1.  Rapid Synchronization

   Basic RTP session synchronization as described in [RFC3550] can be
   slow.  To improve synchronization performance and maintain relative
   backwards compatibility it is RECOMMENDED that the rapid RTP
   synchronization extensions described in [RFC6051] be implemented.

3.3.2.2.  Audio Levels

   These RTP header extensions provide a mechanism to indicate the audio
   level within the same RTP packets as the audio data they pertain to.

   In large conferences, when clients send audio levels of the audio
   sample contained within the RTP packet to the mixer, it can reduce
   the load on the audio mixer as resources for decoding and measuring
   audio streams are not needed.  Because of the performance gains at
   scale, it is RECOMMENDED that the extension described in
   [I-D.ietf-avtext-client-to-mixer-audio-level] be implemented.

   Clients can also optimize performance if the RTP packets sent from
   the mixer contain the audio levels.  It is OPTIONAL for mixers to
   implement the extension described in
   [I-D.ietf-avtext-mixer-to-client-audio-level].

3.4.  RTP Transport Robustness

   This section identifies tools that can be used to add robustness to
   the RTP flows.  Adding robustness to the RTP flow can reduce packet
   loss and thus have a positive impact upon media quality.

3.4.1.  RTP Retransmission

   The retransmission scheme in RTP allows for flexibility of
   retransmissions.  From the receiving side, only selected missing
   packets can be requested.  From the sending side, packets can be
   prioritized based upon the senders knowledge of the receiver's
   missing packets.  Is has been proposed that RTC-WEB applications
   could use the RTP retransmission as defined by [RFC4588], this
   retransmission scheme is problematic for RTC-Web applications on two
   fronts.  The first problem area is the additional latency added by
   [RFC4588] will exceed the latency threshold for interactive voice and
   video.  The second issue is involves the undesirable increase in
   packet transmission at the point when congestion occurs.  Until the
   two issues are addressed, implementing [RFC4588] for RTC-Web

   applications is NOT RECOMMENDED.

3.4.2.  Forward Error Correction

   [Open issue - should there be a FEC scheme recommendation?]

3.4.3.  Multicast

   RTC-WEB client applications support for multicast RTP is NOT
   REQUIRED.

3.5.  RTP Rate Control

   [OPEN ISSUE - There are currently no available, standardized RTP rate
   control mechanism that uses media adaptation.  Having a mechanism in
   place will be REQUIRED for RTC-WEB applications and which means there
   is a need for the IETF to produce this specification.

   A potential starting point for defining a solution is "RTP with TCP
   Friendly Rate Control" [rtp-tfrc].]


4.  Legacy VoIP Interoperability

   The use of RTP as specified above will maximize the interoperability
   capabilities between RTC-Web client applications and legacy VoIP
   systems.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


6.  Security Considerations

   Because there are a number of security issues, considerations and
   requirements for RTC-WEB client applications there is a draft that
   specifically addresses the RTC-WEB application security
   considerations.  This draft defers it's security considerations and
   requirements to the security considerations for RTC-Web draft
   [I-D.ekr-security-considerations-for-rtc-web].
