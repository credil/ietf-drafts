This memo describes the use of Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes to
efficiently provide and/or augment reliability for one-to-many
reliable data transport using IP multicast.  One of the key properties
of FEC codes in this context is the ability to use the same packets
containing FEC data to simultaneously repair different packet loss
patterns at multiple receivers.  Different classes of FEC codes and
some of their basic properties are described and terminology relevant
to implementing FEC in a reliable multicast protocol is introduced.
Examples are provided of possible abstract formats for packets
carrying FEC.

This document is a product of the Reliable Multicast Transport Working
Group of the IETF.
