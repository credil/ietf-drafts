Internet-Draft              SDO Report Blocks              November 2013


1.1.  Synchronization Delay and Offset Metrics Reporting Blocks

   This document defines two new block types to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611], for use in a range of RTP applications.

   The first new block type supports reporting of Initial
   Synchronization Delay to establish multimedia session.  Information
   is recorded about time difference between the start of RTP sessions
   and the time the RTP receiver acquires all components of RTP sessions
   in the multimedia session [RFC6051].

   The second new block type supports reporting of the relative
   synchronization offset time of two arbitrary streams (e.g., between
   audio and video streams), with the same RTCP CNAME included in RTCP
   SDES packets [RFC3550].

   These metrics belong to the class of transport level metrics defined
   in [RFC6792].

1.2.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]
   defined an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This document defines a new Extended Report block for
   use with [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].

1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework

   The RTP Monitoring Architectures [RFC6792] provides guideline for
   reporting block format using RTCP XR.  The new report block described
   in this memo is in compliance with the monitoring architecture
   specified in [RFC6792].

1.4.  Applicability

   When joining each session in layered video sessions [RFC6190] or the
   multimedia session, a receiver may not synchronize playout across the
   multimedia session or layered video session until RTCP SR packets
   have been received on all components of RTP sessions.  The component
   RTP session are referred to as each RTP session for each media type
   in multimedia session or separate RTP session for each layer in the
   layered video session.  For multicast session, the initial
   synchronization delay metric varies with the session bandwidth, the
   number of members, and the number of senders in the session.  The RTP
   flow Initial synchronization delay block defined in this document can
   be used to report such metric, i.e., the initial synchronization
   delay to receive all the RTP streams belonging to the same multimedia
   session or layered video session.  In the absence of packet loss, the



Asaeda, et al.            Expires May 23, 2014                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft              SDO Report Blocks              November 2013


   initial synchronization delay equals to the average time taken to
   receive the first RTCP packet in the RTP session with the longest
   RTCP reporting interval.  In the presence of packet loss, the media
   synchronization should rely on the in-band mapping of RTP and NTP-
   format timestamps [RFC6051] or wait until the reporting interval has
   passed, and the next RTCP SR packet is sent.

   Receivers of the RTP flow initial synchronization delay block could
   use this metric to compare with targets (i.e., Service Level
   Agreement or thresholds of the system) to help ensure the quality of
   real-time application performance.

   In an RTP multimedia session, there can be an arbitrary number of
   streams carried in different RTP sessions, with the same RTCP CNAME.
   These streams may be not synchronized with each other.  For example,
   one audio stream and one video stream belong to the same session, and
   the audio stream is transmitted lagging behind video stream for
   multiple tens of milliseconds [TR-126].  The RTP Flows
   Synchronization Offset block can be used to report such
   synchronization offset between video stream and audio stream.  This
   block is also applied to the case where an RTP session can contain
   media streams with media from multiple media types.  The metrics
   defined in the RTP flows synchronization Offset block can be used by
   network manager for trouble shooting and dealing with user experience
   issues.

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In addition, the following terms are defined:

   Initial Synchronization Delay:

      A multimedia session comprises a set of concurrent RTP sessions
      among a common group of participants, using one RTP session for
      each media type.  The initial synchronization Delay is the average
      time for receiver to synchronize all components of a multimedia
      session [RFC6051].

   Synchronization Offset:

      Synchronization between two media streams must be maintained to
      ensure satisfactory QoE.  Two media streams can be of the same or



Asaeda, et al.            Expires May 23, 2014                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft              SDO Report Blocks              November 2013


      different media type belonging to one RTP session or in different
      media types belonging to one multimedia session.  The
      Synchronization Offset is the relative time difference of the two
      media streams that need to be synchronized.


3.  RTP Flows Initial Synchronization Delay Report Block

   This block is sent by RTP receivers and reports Initial
   synchronization delay beyond the information carried in the standard
   RTCP packet format.  Information is recorded about time difference
   between the start of multimedia session and the time when the RTP
   receiver acquires all components of RTP sessions [RFC6051] measured
   at the receiving end of RTP stream.

   This block needs only be exchanged occasionally, for example sent
   once at the start of RTP session.

3.1.  Metric Block Structure

   The RTP Flows Initial Synchronization Delay Report Block has the
   following format:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

3.2.  Definition of Fields in RTP Flow Initial Synchronization Delay
      Metrics Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      The RTP Flows Initial Synchronization Delay Report Block is
      identified by the constant <RFISD>.

      [Note to RFC Editor: please replace RFISD with the IANA provided
      RTCP XR block type for this block.]

   Reserved: 8 bits

Internet-Draft              SDO Report Blocks              November 2013


      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      ignored by the receiver.

   Block length: 16 bits

      The constant 2, in accordance with the definition of this field in
      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   SSRC of source: 32 bits

      The SSRC of the media source SHALL be set to the value of the SSRC
      identifier carried in any arbitrary component of RTP sessions
      belonging to the same multimedia session.

   Initial Synchronization Delay: 32 bits

      The average delay, expressed in units of 1/65536 seconds, from the
      beginning of multimedia session [RFC6051] to the time when RTCP
      packets are received on all of the components RTP sessions.  It is
      recommended that the beginning of multimedia session is chosen as
      the time when the receiver has joined the first RTP session of the
      multimedia session.  The value of the initial synchronization
      delay is calculated based on received RTCP SR packets or the RTP
      header extension containing in-band mapping of RTP and NTP-format
      timestamps [RFC6051].  If there is no packet loss, the initial
      synchronization delay is expected to be equal to the average time
      taken to receive the first RTCP packet in the RTP session with the
      longest RTCP reporting interval or the average time taken to
      receive the first RTP header extension containing in-band mapping
      of RTP and NTP-format timestamps.

      If the measurement is unavailable, the value of this field with
      all bits set to 1 MUST be reported.

4.  RTP Flows Synchronization Offset Metrics Block

   In the RTP multimedia sessions or one RTP session, there can be an
   arbitrary number of Media streams and each media stream (e.g., audio
   stream or video stream) is sent in a separate RTP stream.  In case of
   one RTP session, each media stream or each medium uses different
   SSRC.  The receiver associates RTP streams to be synchronized by
   means of RTCP CNAME contained in the RTCP Source Description (SDES)
   packets [RFC3550].

   This block is sent by RTP receivers and reports synchronization
   offset of two arbitrary RTP streams that needs to be synchronized in
   the RTP multimedia session.  Information is recorded about the

   relative average time difference between two arbitrary RTP streams
   (one is reporting stream, the other is reference stream) with the
   same CNAME and measured at the receiving end of RTP stream.  In order
   to tell what the offset of reporting stream is relative to, the block
   for reference stream with synchronization offset of zero should be
   reported.

   Instances of this Block refer by Synchronization source (SSRC) to the
   separate auxiliary Measurement Information block [RFC6776] which
   describes measurement periods in use (see [RFC6776] section 4.2).
   This metrics block relies on the measurement period in the
   Measurement Information block indicating the span of the report and
   SHOULD be sent in the same compound RTCP packet as the measurement
   information block.  If the measurement period is not received in the
   same compound RTCP packet as this Block, this Block MUST be
   discarded.

4.1.  Metric Block Structure

   The RTP Flow General Synchronization Offset Report Block has the
   following format:

    0                   1                   2                   3

4.2.  Definition of Fields in RTP Flow General Synchronization Offset
      Metrics Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      The RTP Flow General Synchronization Offset Report Block is
      identified by the constant <RFSO>.

      [Note to RFC Editor: please replace RFSO with the IANA provided
      RTCP XR block type for this block.]

   Interval Metric Flag (I): 2 bits

      This field is used to indicate whether the Burst/Gap Discard
      Summary Statistics metrics are Sampled, Interval or Cumulative
      metrics:



            I=10: Interval Duration - the reported value applies to the
            most recent measurement interval duration between successive
            metrics reports.
            I=11: Cumulative Duration - the reported value applies to
            the accumulation period characteristic of cumulative
            measurements.
            I=01: Sampled Value - the reported value is a sampled
            instantaneous value.



      In this document, the value I=00 is the reserved value and MUST
      NOT be used.

   Reserved: 6 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      MUST be ignored by the receiver.

   Block length: 16 bits

      The constant 3, in accordance with the definition of this field in
      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   SSRC of Source: 32 bits

      The SSRC of the media source SHALL be set to the value of the SSRC
      identifier of the reporting RTP stream to which the XR relates.

   Synchronization Offset: 64 bits

      The synchronization offset of the reporting RTP stream relative to
      the reference stream with the same CNAME.  The calculation of
      Synchronization Offset is similar to Difference D calculation in
      the RFC3550.  That is to say, if Si is the NTP timestamp from the
      reporting RTP packet i, and Ri is the time of arrival in NTP
      timestamp units for reporting RTP packet i, Sj is the NTP
      timestamp from the reference RTP packet j, and Rj is the time of
      arrival in NTP timestamp units for reference RTP packet j, then
      the value of the synchronization offset D may be expressed as




Asaeda, et al.            Expires May 23, 2014                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft              SDO Report Blocks              November 2013


            D(i,j) = (Rj - Ri) - (Sj - Si) = (Rj - Sj) - (Ri - Si)


      If in-band delivery of NTP-format timestamps is supported
      [RFC6051], Si and Sj should be obtained directly from the RTP
      packets where NTP timestamps are available.  If not, Si and Sj
      should be calculated from their corresponding RTP timestamps.  The
      value of the synchronization offset is represented using a 64-bit
      signed NTP-format timestamp as defined in [RFC5905], which is
      64-bit signed fixed-point number with the integer part in the
      first 32 bits and the fractional part in the last 32 bits.  A
      positive value of the synchronization offset means that the
      reporting stream leads before the reference stream, while a
      negative one means the reporting stream lags behind the reference
      stream.  The synchronization offset of zero means the stream is
      the reference stream.

      If the measurement is unavailable, the value of this field with
      all bits set to 1 MUST be reported.

5.  SDP Signaling

   [RFC3611] defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol)
   [RFC4566] for signaling the use of XR blocks.  XR blocks MAY be used
   without prior signaling.

5.1.  SDP rtcp-xr-attrib Attribute Extension

   Two new parameters are defined for the two report blocks defined in
   this document to be used with Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [RFC4566] using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234].
   They have the following syntax within the "rtcp-xr" attribute
   [RFC3611]:

   xr-format = xr-rfisd-block
             / xr-rfso-block

   xr-rfisd-block = "rtp-flow-init-syn-delay"
   xr-rfso-block = "rtp-flow-syn-offset"

   Refer to Section 5.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611] for a detailed description
   and the full syntax of the "rtcp-xr" attribute.

5.2.  Offer/Answer Usage

   When SDP is used in offer-answer context, the SDP Offer/Answer usage
   defined in [RFC3611] applies.

6.  IANA Considerations

   New report block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.
   For general guidelines on IANA allocations for RTCP XR, refer to
   Section 6.2 of [RFC3611].

   This document assigns two new block type values in the RTCP XR Block
   Type Registry:



      Name:       RFISD
      Long Name:  RTP Flows Initial Synchronization Delay
      Value       <RFISD>
      Reference:  Section 3

      Name:       RFSO
      Long Name:  RTP Flows Synchronization Offset Metrics Block
      Value       <RFSO>
      Reference:  Section 4


   This document also registers two new SDP [RFC4566] parameters for the
   "rtcp-xr" attribute in the RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry:



      *  "rtp-flow-init-syn-delay "
      *  "rtp-flow-syn-offset"

   The contact information for the registrations is:

7.  Security Considerations

   The new RTCP XR report blocks proposed in this document introduces no
   new security considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611].
