                    draft-ymbk-no-subnet-anycast-00

Abstract

   IPv6 Subnet Anycast is not used operationally, complicates
   implementations, and complicates protocol specifications.  The form
   of anycast actually used in the Internet is routing-based, and is
   essentilly the same as that of IPv4 anycast.  Therefore, this
   document deprecates IPv6 Subnet Anycast.

   This is an early draft and will require non-trivial fill-in and
   details.

1.  Introduction

   The form of anycast which is used in the operational internet is
   described in [RFC4786].  This is used widely in IPv4 and IPv6.  To
   quote,

      "To distribute a service using anycast, the service is first
      associated with a stable set of IP addresses, and reachability to
      those addresses is advertised in a routing system from multiple,
      independent service nodes."

   IPv6 subnet anycast, as defined in [RFC2526], complicates host and
   router stacks.  It also makes address assignment needlessly complex,
   see [RFC6164].

   IPv6 Subnet Anycast is not actually used or deployed.  In this case,
   it is fairly certain that implementations are not even debugged.

   As IPv6 becomes more widely deployed, having special unused code in
   the critical code path is unnecessary, unwise, and invites bugs and
   inefficiency.

   There is no need for reserved subnet anycast addresses, because any
   address can be an anycast address.  Only the node where an anycast
   address is configured needs to know that it is an anycast address.
   That is, there is no need to be able to recognise such an address
   from its format.  The use of IPv4 anycast has not been impeded by the
   inability to tell an anycast address from an ordinary address.

   Therefore, this document deprecates IPv6 Subnet Anycast addresses and
   removes the relevance conformance requirements from host and router
   implementations.


2.  Security Considerations

   There are no known security implications for this document.  It
   probably reduces vulnerabilities.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document asks nothing of the IANA.
