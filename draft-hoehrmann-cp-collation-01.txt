                       The i;codepoint collation
                    draft-hoehrmann-cp-collation-01

Abstract

   This memo describes the "i;codepoint" collation.  Character strings
   are compared based on the Unicode scalar values of the characters.
   The collation supports equality, substring, and ordering operations.

   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

Internet-Draft          The i;codepoint collation         September 2010


1.  Introduction

   The i;codepoint collation operates on Unicode strings and treats any
   and all differences between two strings as significant.  Ordering of
   different strings is determined by the Unicode scalar values of the
   characters.  It produces usable results where further information is
   unavailable.  In that it is suitable as default collation.

   The equality operation determines if two strings are identical.  This
   makes the collation suitable for use with strings known to be in some
   canonical form.  Similarily, applications that require strings to be
   in a canonical but otherwise arbitrary order may find this collation
   the most efficient as it requires no transformations.

2.  Definition

   The i;codepoint collation is the same as the i;octet collation except
   that it operates on sequences of Unicode scalar values, not octets.
   Note that by definition the set of Unicode scalar values excludes the
   surrogate code points and as such they do not occur in valid input.

3.  Security Considerations

   None beyond those in RFC 4790 [RFC4790].

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines the i;codepoint collation as per [RFC4790].
