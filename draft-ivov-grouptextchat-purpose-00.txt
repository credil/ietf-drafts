1.  Introduction

   The Conference Event Package [RFC4575] defines means for a SIP User
   Agent (UA) to obtain information about the state of the conference,
   the types of media that are being used, the number and state of
   current participants, additional sources of information such as a web
   page, availability of recordings and others.

   Details describing auxiliary services available for a are included
   within a <service-uris> child element of the <conference-description>
   element.  Such details are presented as a set of <entry> child
   elements each containing the URI allowing access the corresponding
   auxiliary service.  In addition to the URI, entries can also contain
   a descriptive <display-text> element and are expected to also have a
   <purpose> element that specifies their nature as illustrated in the
   following example:


   <conference-description>
   <subject>Agenda: This sprint's goals</subject>
     <service-uris>
       <entry>
         <uri>http://sharepoint/salesgroup/</uri>
         <purpose>web-page</purpose>
       </entry>
     </service-uris>
   </conference-description>



   In addition to the "web-page" purpose mentioned above, [RFC4575] also
   defines several other possible values in a "URI purposes" a sub-
   registry "URI purposes" under the existing registry: http://
   www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters.

   This specification adds the "grouptextchat" value in this "URI
   purposes" sub-registry.  The new value allows conference mixers or

   focus agents to advertise a multi-user chat location (i.e.  a chat
   room) associated with the current conference.

   The actual URI carried by the entry with the "grouptextchat" purpose
   can be of any type as long as the content that it points to would
   allow for instant text communication between participants of the
   conference.  Suitable URI schemes include sip: and sips: [RFC3261]
   for SIP signalled Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) conferences,
   xmpp: [RFC5122] for XMPP Multi-User Chat (MUC), irc: for Internet
   Relay Chat, http: or https: for web-based chat, and others.

   The following example shows one possible use case:


   <conference-description>
   <subject>Agenda: This sprint's goals</subject>
     <service-uris>
       <entry>
         <uri>xmpp:sprint@conference.example.com</uri>
         <purpose>grouptextchat</purpose>
       </entry>
     </service-uris>
   </conference-description>



   It is worth pointing out that, in addition to simply adding text
   messaging capabilities to an audio/video conference, group chats can
   also be used for defining roles, giving permissions, muting, kicking
   and banning participants, etc.  A conference mixer or focus agent,
   can mimic these settings within the conference call, actually muting,
   kicking, or banning participants in the call as these actions occur
   in the chat room.  Such an approach requires no additional
   specification and is purely an implementation decision for the
   conferencing software.

   It is also worth mentioning that it is possible for the grouptextchat
   URI to match the URI of the conference.  This would typically be the
   case in scenarios where the conference focus also provides a SIP
   signalled MSRP chat service at the.

2.  Security Considerations

   Advertising group text chats over SIP could provide malicious
   entities with the following attack vector: if a malicious entity is
   capable of intercepting and modifying conference package event
   notifications, it could trick participants in to joining a third
   party chat room where the attacker could eavesdrop on the

   conversation and potentially even impersonate some of the
   participants.

   Similar attacks are already possible with the "participation"
   <conference-uris> defined in [RFC4575] which is why it recommends "a
   strong means for authentication and conference information
   protection" as well as "comprehensive authorization rules".  Clients
   can integrity protect and encrypt notification messages using end-to-
   end mechanisms such as S/MIME or hop-by-hop mechanisms such as TLS.
   When none of the above are possible it is RECOMMENDED that clients
   clearly display the address of the destination chat room (before and
   after it has been joined).

3.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to add a new predefined value "grouptextchat"
   in the "URI purposes" sub-registry of the http://www.iana.org/
   assignments/sip-parameters registry as follows:

   Value: grouptextchat
   Description: The URI can be used to join a multi-user chat directly
   associated with the conference
