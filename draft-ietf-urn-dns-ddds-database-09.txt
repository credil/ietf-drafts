This document describes a Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS)
Database using the Domain Name System (DNS) as a distributed database
of Rules.  The Keys are domain-names and the Rules are encoded using
the Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR) Resource Record (RR).

Since this document obsoletes RFC 2915, it is the official
specification for the NAPTR DNS Resource Record.  It is also part of
a series that is completely specified in "Dynamic Delegation
Discovery System (DDDS) Part One: The Comprehensive DDDS"
(RFC 3401).  It is very important to note that it is impossible to
read and understand any document in this series without reading the
others.

This document is a product of the Uniform Resource Names Working Group
of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
