Such functions include Access Point Name (APN) Selection,      multiple Packet Data Network (PDN) connections and seamless mobility      between WiFi and 3G/4G networks.</t>      <t>EAP/AKA (and EAP/AKA') is standardized by 3GPP as the access      authentication protocol for trusted access networks. This IETF      specification is required for mobile devices to access the 3GPP Evolved      Packet Core (EPC) networks. This document defines a few new EAP      attributes and procedures to provide the above-mentioned functions in      trusted WiFi access networks.</t>    </abstract>  </front>  <middle>    <section anchor="sec:intro" title="Introduction">      <t>The convergence of multiple access technologies is becoming more      reality now than ever. Specifically, WiFi has emerged as a trusted      access technology for mobile service providers. It has become important      to provide certain functions in WiFi which are commonly supported in      licensed-spectrum networks such as 3G and 4G networks. This draft      specifies a few new EAP attributes and procedures for a Mobile Node (MN)      to interact with the network to support some of the functions (see      below). These new attributes serve as a trigger for network nodes to      undertake the relevant mobility operations. For instance, when the      Mobile Node indicates and the network agrees for a new IP session (i.e.,      a new APN in 3GPP), the corresponding attribute (defined below) can act      as a trigger for the Mobile Anchor Gateway (MAG) to initiate a new      mobility session with the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA).</t>      <t>The 3GPP networks support many functions that are not commonly      implemented in a WiFi network. This draft specifically addresses the      following functions and specifies methods to implement them using      EAP/EAP-AKA.</t>      <t>The following sections will focus on implementation of the following      functions in the context of a 802.1X/EAP based WiFi network.</t>      <t><list style="hanging">          <t>o APN Selection</t>          <t>o Multiple APN Connectivity</t>          <t>o WiFi to 3G/4G (UTRAN/EUTRAN) mobility</t>        </list></t>      <t>EAP <xref target="RFC3748"></xref>, along with EAP-AKA <xref      target="RFC4187"></xref> is widely deployed in access networks to      authenticate the user during network attach, and periodically      afterwards. Apart from being an authentication mechanism, EAP provides a      conduit to propagate information between a MN and network elements such      as a WiFi Access Controller. Each of the addressed functions is      described in detail below.</t>      <section title="APN Selection">        <t>The 3GPP networks support the concept of an APN (Access Point        Name). This is defined in <xref target="GPRS"></xref>. Each APN is an        independent IP network with it's own set of IP services. When the MN        attaches to the network, it may select a specific APN to receive        desired services. For example, to receive generic internet services,        user device may select APN "Internet" and to receive IMS voice        services, it may select APN "IMSvoice".</t>        <t>In a WiFi access scenario, a MN needs a way of sending the desired        APN name to the network. This draft specifies a method to propagate        the APN information via EAP.</t>      </section>      <section title="Multiple APN Connectivity">        <t>As an extension of APN Selection, a MN may choose to connect to        multiple IP networks simultaneously. 3GPP provides this feature via        Additional PDP contexts or Additional PDN connections. The 3GPP        defines extensive set of signaling procedures to implement these        features. In a WiFi network, a MN connects to the first APN via DHCPv4        or IPv6 Router Solicitation. For subsequent APN connections, a        procedure is needed to request the network and propagate necessary        information.</t>      </section>      <section title="WiFi to EUTRAN mobility">        <t>When operating in a multi-access network, a MN may want to        gracefully handover it's IP attachment from one access to another. For        instance, a MN connected to 3GPP EUTRAN network may choose to move its        connectivity to a trusted WiFi network. Alternatively, the MN may        choose to connect from both the access technologies simultaneously,        and maintain two independent IP attachments. To implement these        scenarios, the MN needs a way to indicate seamless handover as well as        a means to correlate the UTRAN/EUTRAN session with the new WiFi        session. This draft specifies a method to propagate EUTRAN session        identification (GUTI) to the network via EAP. This helps the network        to correlate the sessions between the two RAN technologies and        implement a handover.</t>      </section>    </section>    <section anchor="sec:requirements"             title="Reference Architecture and Terminology">      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this      document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].</t>    </section>    <section anchor="sec:proto-overview" title="Protocol Overview">      <section title="Brief Introduction to EAP">        <t>EAP is defined as a generic protocol in <xref        target="RFC3748"></xref>.

Both the EAP Authentication and EAP Fast Re-Authentication        procedures are specified for trusted access network use in 3GPP <xref        target="3GPP-TS-33.402"></xref></t>      </section>      <section title="802.11 Authentication using EAP over 802.1X">        <t>In a WiFi network, EAP is carried over the IEEE 802.1X        Authentication protocol. The IEEE 802.1X Authentication is a        transparent, payload-unaware mechanism to carry the authentication        messages between the MN and the WiFi network elements.</t>        <t>EAP, on the other hand, has multiple purposes. Apart from it's core        functions of communicating MN's identity to the network and proving        MN's credentials, it also allows the MN to send arbitrary information        elements to help establish the MN's IP session in the network.
