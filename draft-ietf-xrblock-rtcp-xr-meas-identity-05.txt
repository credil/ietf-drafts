1.  Introduction

   This document defines one new RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Source
   Description (SDES) [RFC3550] item, and one new Extended Report (XR)
   Report Block carrying parameters that identify and describe a
   measurement period, to which one or more other RTCP XR Report Blocks
   may refer.

   The SDES item provides a field for an application specific auxiliary
   identifier.  This identifier may be used to correlate data in XR
   Blocks within an RTP session with data from a non-RTP session.

   A RTCP Measurement Identity SDES packet may be associated with a set
   of RTCP XR metrics blocks which share the same application specific
   measurement identifier.

   The XR Report Block does not contain any measurement results
   (metrics).  Instead, it provides information relevant to a
   measurement reported in one or more other block types, including:

   o  the sequence number of the first packet of the RTP session,

   o  the extended sequence numbers of the first packet of the current
      measurement interval, and the last packet included in the
      measurement,

   o  the duration of the most recent measurement interval and

   o  the duration of the interval applicable to cumulative measurements
      (which may be the duration of the RTP session to date).

   The method for calculation of the extended RTP sequence number is
   provide in Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550].

   The RTCP XR Report Block containing the measurement information is
   intended to provide a single copy of the information necessary to
   relate measurement data in the RTCP XR blocks to the stream, and
   measurement period, to which they refer.  Commonly, multiple other
   small metric blocks contain measurement data for the same stream and
   period, and it would be a large overhead if all of these metric
   blocks carried duplicated data for measurement identification.

   The RTCP XR Report Block may be associated with a set of RTCP XR
   metrics blocks which share the same information relevant to a
   reported measurement.  There may be several such sets in an RTCP
   packet, in which each set share the same information relevant to a
   reported measurement.  There may also be RTCP XR blocks in the packet
   which are not associated with a Measurement Information block, for

   example blocks which were defined before the Measurement Identity and
   information mechanism was introduced by this document.

1.1.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]
   defines an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This document defines a new Extended Report block that
   must be used as defined in [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].

1.2.  Performance Metrics Framework

   The Performance Metrics Framework [RFC6390] provides guidance on the
   definition and specification of performance metrics.  The RTP
   Monitoring Architectures[MONARCH] provides guideline for reporting
   block format using RTCP XR.  The SDES item and XR Block described in
   this document are in accordance with [RFC6390] and [MONARCH].

1.3.  Applicability

   The RTCP SDES item and the RTCP XR block defined in this document
   provides information relevant to the measurements for members of a
   family of RTCP XR metrics blocks which are designed to use it.  To
   use the mechanism defined here, the RTCP XR block containing
   measurement information is not required to be in the same RTCP packet
   as the SDES item containing measurement identity.

3.  Measurement Identity SDES Item

   This section defines the format of the Measurement Identity SDES
   item.  The SDES item is carried in the RTCP SDES packet.  The packet
   format for the RTCP SDES is defined in Section 6.5 of [RFC3550].
   Each SDES packet is composed of a header with fixed-length fields for
   version, source count, packet type (PT), and length, followed by zero
   of more SDES items.  In the SDES packet, the PT field is set to SDES
   (202).

3.1.  APSI: Application Specific Identifier SDES Item

       0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |   ....
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Application specific identifier is an additional identifier which is
   useful in the context of a specific application, e.g. an MPEG-2
   transport identifier [MPEG2].  This item MUST be ignored by
   applications that are not configured to make use of it.  The
   identifier is variable length.  Its length is described by the length
   field.  The value of the length field does not include the two octet
   SDES item header.  If no identifier is provided, the length field
   MUST be set to zero.

Internet-Draft            Measurement Reporting               April 2012


   SSRC of source: 32 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3611].


   Reserved: 16 bits

      These bits are reserved.  They MUST be set to zero by senders and
      ignored by receivers.


   First sequence number: 16 bits

      The RTP sequence number of the first received RTP packet of the
      session, used to determine the number of packets contributing to
      cumulative measurements.


   Extended first sequence number of interval: 32 bits

      The extended RTP sequence number of the first received RTP packet
      of the current measurement interval.  In accordance with
      [RFC3550], the extended sequence number is expressed as the low 16
      bits value containing the sequence number received in an RTP data
      packet and the most significant 16 bits value containing the
      corresponding count of sequence number cycles.


   Extended last sequence number: 32 bits

      The extended RTP sequence number of the last received RTP packet
      which contributed to this measurement.  In accordance with
      [RFC3550], the extended sequence number is expressed as the low 16
      bits value containing the sequence number received in an RTP data
      packet and the most significant 16 bits value containing the
      corresponding count of sequence number cycles.


   Measurement Duration (Cumulative) : 32 bits

      The duration, expressed in units of 1/65536 seconds, of the
      reporting interval applicable to Cumulative reports which use this
      Measurement Information block.  The value of this field can be
      calculated by the receiver of the RTP media stream, for example,
      based on received RTP media packets or using RTCP method described
      in [RFC3550].

5.  IANA Considerations

   New SDES types for RTCP SDES are subject to IANA registration.  For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP SDES, refer to
   [RFC3550].

5.1.  New RTCP SDES Type value

   This document assigns one additional SDES type in the IANA "RTCP XR
   Block Type Registry" to the Measurement Identity SDES items as
   follow:

   abbrev.      name                          value
   APSI: Application Specific Identifier       TBD

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace APSI with the IANA provided RTCP
   SDES type for the SDES item.]

5.2.  New RTCP XR Block Type value

   This document assigns the block type value NMI in the IANA "RTCP XR
   Block Type Registry" to the "Measurement Information Block".

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NMI with the IANA provided RTCP
   XR block type for this block.]

5.3.  Contact information for registrations

6.  Security Considerations

   RTCP reports can contain sensitive information, including information
   about the nature and duration of a session established between two or
   more endpoints.  Therefore, the use of security mechanisms with RTP,
   as documented in Section 9 of [RFC3550] SHOULD apply.
