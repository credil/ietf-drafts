                   draft-shen-traceroute-ping-ext-03

Abstract

   This document specifies extensions to traceroute and ping techniques
   to facilitate addition application information to be carried in UDP,
   TCP and ICMP traceroute probe messages and ICMP echo request and
   reply messages.  This proposal also allows the receiver to
   authenticate the source of the traceroute and ping senders.

Internet-Draft          Traceroute Ping Extension           October 2011


1.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   Traceroute and Ping are two of commonly used tools in the diagnosis
   of network problems.  This document proposes the mechanism by which
   the traceroute probe messages and ICMP echo request/reply messages
   can be extended to include other user information various
   applications may want to include; and it can be optionally
   authenticated by the receiving node(s).  These mechanisms are
   intended for network operators to perform more secured network
   management and troubleshooting tasks while using traceroute and ping
   tools.  The changes proposed in this document are backward compatible
   (with the existing traceroute and ping tools) and applicable to both
   IPv4 and IPv6 networks.

   The mechanisms specified in this document apply to to the following
   traceroute and ping probe protocols: UDP [RFC0768], TCP [RFC0793],
   and ICMP/ICMPv6 [RFC0792] [RFC4443].  This mechanism also applies to
   the ICMP/ICMPv6 echo reply messages [RFC0792].

   This document defines an extension for traceroute and ping probe
   messages to optionally include authentication signature object.  The
   intermediate and destination nodes can authenticate the sender of the
   traceroute or ping packet before providing the requested information
   in the ICMP response.  This document also defines an optional
   Information-Request Object for the traceroute/ping extension.  This
   Object specifies the types of information the sender expects to be
   included in the traceroute/ping response (i.e., in the ICMP message
   elicited by the traceroute/ping packet and generated by the
   intermediate or destination node or nodes).

   Other applications can define their own Trace-Ping objects using this
   extension.


3.  Motivation

   The current traceroute or ping has no defined mechanism to include
   application data on the sender side, or to include application data
   in the ICMP echo reply on the receiver side.  Although the [RFC4884]
   has defined the multi-part message extension in ICMP, it is applied
   only to the ICMP type 3, 11 and 12 for traceroute reply messages.

Internet-Draft          Traceroute Ping Extension           October 2011


   Those mechanisms are not applied to traceroute probe messages or ICMP
   echo request/reply messages.

   For security concerns of traceroute or ping packets, one may employ a
   rudimentary control mechanism to limit the trusted senders by
   defining on every router the access control lists specifying source
   addresses of the traceroute and ping message, such mechanism is
   deemed configuration intensive, static, and error-prone.  Moreover,
   such mechanism would be susceptible to address spoofing.
   Additionally, such mechanism does not provide the sender with dynamic
   control of the different kind of extensions to be requested.

   The ICMP reply messages has been extended to support multi-part
   message inside ICMP [RFC4884] for some ICMP types.  Some of the
   applications [RFC5837] [RFC4950] [I-D.shen-icmp-routing-inst] are
   designed mainly for internal network troubleshooting by network
   operators.  Network providers may want to limit those applications
   only to trusted senders of traceroute/ping probes due to security or
   policy reasons by using this mechanism described in this document.

   Other applications, for example the TRILL-OAM [I-D.tissa-trill-oam]
   can use this scheme to extend their OAM application using ICMP echo
   request and reply for data center troubleshootings.


4.  Trace-Ping Message Extension

   This proposed extension is to define a Trace-Ping data structure
   which resides within UDP/TCP/ICMP data field; and to reserve the
   lowest 4 bits inside a 16-bit field within UDP/TCP/ICMP headers to
   indicate the extension structure offset location.

   In most of the traceroute implementation, there is some private data
   in probe messages used by traceroute applications.  With this
   "extension offset" defined, the applications can continue to use
   those private data while supporting this Trace-Ping extension in a
   deterministic way.  This extension applies to both traceroute and
   ping applications.

4.1.  Trace-Ping Extension Structure

   The Trace-Ping structure starts in UDP/TCP/ICMP data field location
   from 0 to 56 octets specified in the Trace-Ping "extension offset",
   see Section 4.2, in 32-bit boundary.  It MUST have exactly one Trace-
   Ping common header followed by zero or more Trace-Ping Objects.

4.1.1.  Trace-Ping Common Header

   The Common Header is a 8 octets structure has the following format:


      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

     |Version|        Length         |           Checksum            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                  Magic-Number (0x54726163)                    |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The fields of the Common Header are defined as follows:

   Version: 4 bits.  It is defined as 1 in this document.

   Length:  12 bits.  The total length of the Trace-Ping data structure
            specifying number of 32-bit words (includes the common
            header and all the Objects).

   Checksum:  16 bits.  The one's complement of the one's complement sum
            of the Trace-Ping data structure, with the checksum field
            replaced by zero for the purpose of computing the checksum.

   Magic Number:  32 bits.  It is defined as Hex value of 0x54726163 in
            this document.  This is used mainly for structure
            identification of this extension version.

4.1.2.  Trace-Ping Object

   Trace-Ping Object have the following format:


      0                   1                   2                   3

   Length:  16 bits.  Length of object, measured in octets, including
            the object header and object payload.

   Class-Num:  8 bits.  Identifies ICMP Trace-Ping object class.

   C-Type:  8 bits.  Identifies ICMP Trace-Ping object sub-type.

   All the Trace-Ping Objects are optional.  This document defines two
   Trace-Ping Objects below.

4.1.2.1.  Trace-Ping Authentication Object

   This Object carries the HMAC authentication related information.  It
   verifies both the data integrity and the authenticity of the entire
   message.  This Object has the following format:


      0                   1                   2                   3

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |     Auth Type                 |    Key ID     | Auth Data Len |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                                                               |
     |                     Auth Data (Variable)                      |
     |                                                               |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ...

   Length:  Variable, in octets.

   Class-Num:  IANA allocation from ICMP Trace-Ping extension registry.

   C-Type:  1

   Auth Type:  16 bits.  The following values are proposed:

            *  Type=0 signifies no authentication.

            *  Type=1 signifies simple password based authentication.

            *  Type=2 signifies Cryptographic authentication.

            Please note that the above type values are in line with IANA
            allocated values for other protocols (e.g., OSPF).

   Key ID:  8 bits.  This allows multiple secret keys to be active
            simultaneously.  Using Key IDs makes the key rollover
            convenient.  Each secret key must be associated with the
            hash algorithm.  This may be done through provisioning on
            each node.

   Auth Data Len:  8 bits.  This specifies the length of the
            authentication data (and allows for the support of current
            and future authentication schemes).

   Auth Data:  Variable length.  This field carries the result (e.g.,
            HMAC code) of the HMAC algorithm applied over the entire
            traceroute/ping IP/IPv6 packet.  When the Auth data is
            calculated, the shared key is stored in this field, and the
            checksum fields in the IP header, UDP/TCP/ICMP header and
            Trace-Ping common header are set to zero.  The result of the
            algorithm is placed in the Auth Key field.  The following
            lists algorithms that could be commonly supported:

            *  HMAC-MD5

            *  HMAC-SHA1

            *  HMAC-SHA2 variants (e.g., 224, 256, 384, 512, etc.)

            At least HMAC-MD5 and HMAC-SHA1 algorithms should be
            supported on all the nodes compliant with this
            specification.

4.1.2.2.  Trace-Ping Information-Request Object

   The Information-Request Object has the following format:


      0                   1                   2                   3

     |                       Info Request                            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Length:  8

   Class-Num:  IANA allocation, the same Class-Num value as in
            Section 4.1.2.1.

   C-Type:  2

   Info-Req:  32 bits.  This bitflag field lists the request items the
            probe sender is interested.  The bit number ranges from the
            right most bit to the left most bit.  Currently defined as
            the following:

              Bit Number Information Item
                   0     MPLS label related attributes
                   1     Interface related attributes

                   3     Routing Instance related attributes
                   4     Nexthop(s) related attributes
                   5     Device role related attributes

4.2.  Trace-Ping Extension Offset Field

   This Trace-Ping "extension offset" field is defined as the lowest
   nibble within a 16-bit field, and it specifies the position at which
   the Trace-Ping extension data structure begins.  The value represents
   32-bit words ranges from 0x0 to 0xF, with value 0xF as reserved.
   Thus the position of the Trace-Ping data structure can start from 0
   to 56 octets inside TCP, UDP or ICMP request and reply message data
   field.  The Trace-Ping "extension offset" field value 0xF indicates
   there is no Trace-Ping data structure inside the message data field.

   The Trace-Ping "extension offset" field is defined as the following:


    0                   1
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                       |Ext-Off|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Ext-Off: 4 bits.  The value (Ext-Off) represents the Trace-Ping data
            structure start position in 32-bit words.  The Ext-Off value
            0xF is reserved.

   The rest of the 12 bits out of this 16-bit field is not changed by
   this proposal.  For application usage detail in terms of different
   traceroute/ping probe types, see Section 4.2.4.

4.2.1.  UDP Messages

   In the UDP traceroute/ping probe case, this 16-bit field is the UDP
   source port field in UDP header [RFC0768].  The "Ext-Off" specifies
   the Trace-Ping extension structure start location inside UDP data

   In the TCP traceroute/ping probe case, this 16-bit field is the TCP
   source port field in TCP header [RFC0793].  The "Ext-Off" specifies
   the Trace-Ping extension structure start location inside TCP data
   field.  The below diagram shows the "Ext-Off" position in the TCP
   header of the "Source Port" field.

4.2.3.  ICMP Messages

   In the ICMP traceroute/ping request/reply case, this 16-bit field is
   the "Identifier" field of ICMP type 0 or 8 structure [RFC0792], The
   "Ext-Off" specifies the Trace-Ping extension structure start location
   inside ICMP data field of the type 0(ICMP echo reply) and type 8(ICMP
   echo request) message.  The below diagram shows the "Ext-Off"
   position in the ICMP type 0 or 8 "Identifier" field.

   The ICMP echo reply is normally implemented by copying the data field
   of the ICMP echo request into the ICMP echo reply data field.  When
   this Trace-Ping extension is used, it will overwrite part or whole
   portion of the original data field.  The ICMP echo reply packet can
   be longer in length then the ICMP echo request in the case
   application has more data to include then the original echo request
   data field length.The ICMP echo reply application data using Trace-
   Ping extension is located by the "Ext-Off" filed.

   If the ICMP echo request and reply both support this Trace-Ping
   extension, then the upper 12-bits of the Id filed of the ICMP echo
   request SHOULD be copied to the upper 12-bits of the Id field of the
   ICMP echo reply message.  The "Ext-Off" field of the echo request and
   reply messages can be different if this is necessary.

4.2.4.  Implementation Discussion

   In the majority of today's traceroute implementations, the
   application process identifier (process-ID) is used as the UDP source
   port for UDP type of traceroute probe; in TCP implementation, the
   process-ID is used as the TCP source port for traceroute probe; and
   the process-ID is also used as the ICMP Identifier of ICMP type 8
   message.  With this extension, an implementation can use the highest
   12-bits of the source port field for UDP/TCP header and ID field for
   ICMP type 8 message to encode this process information since the
   lowest 4-bits are now reserved for the Trace-Ping "extension offset".

Internet-Draft          Traceroute Ping Extension           October 2011


   Ping implementation is similar to traceroute, it either uses the
   process-ID or an internally generated number inside the ICMP echo
   request ID field and in UDP/TCP source port field.  An implementation
   now can use the highest 12-bits of the field and leave the lowest
   4-bits for the Trace-Ping extension.


5.  Implementation and Operation Considerations

   There is no change in this extension for the normal traceroute/ping
   implementation and operation except for reserving the lowest 4 bits
   in the UDP/TCP source port field and ICMP Id field of type 0 and type
   8 message.  The implementations for the sender can use the same
   semantics with this 16-bit field; and it makes no difference to the
   receivers if they don't support this extension.

5.1.  Traceroute and Ping Probe Sender

   The sender supports this extension MAY include the Trace-Ping
   structure in it's traceroute/ping probe to specify the request types,
   authentication key, or other application objects.  The sender SHOULD
   set the "extension offset" value to 0xF if there is no Trace-Ping
   structure present inside the probe.  The sender MAY request one or
   multiple types of information defined in the Trace-Ping "Info-Req"
   Object.

5.2.  Traceroute and Ping Probe Receiver

   When the traceroute/ping probe receiver, the intermediate and
   destination node, processes the incoming probe, it MAY check the
   Trace-Ping structure to verify if the sender is from an authenticated
   host and to see what types of information it requested.  This check
   is only needed when the receiver tries to authenticate the probe
   sender, or when the receiver is formating the ICMP and ICMPv6s that
   support multi-part messages or this Trace-Ping extension messages
   inside the echo reply object, and it has certain internal information
   that can be included in the ICMP packets.

   If the Trace-Ping "extension offset" value is not 0xF, the Trace-Ping
   structure may be present.  The receiver MUST verify the integrity of
   the data structure by examining the "version" field, the Magic-Number
   value, and the length of the Trace-Ping structure.  It MUST perform
   the checksum to verify the Trace-Ping data structure.  If the
   authentication Object is present and the local policy requires it to
   perform the verification, the receiver MUST use it's locally stored
   shared key to validate the checksum in the Object.  Multiple
   Authentication Keys can be used which can be useful in the case the
   probes are from trusted peer networks.

Internet-Draft          Traceroute Ping Extension           October 2011


   If the Trace-Ping "Info-Req" Object is included, the receiver SHOULD
   fetch the related information when formating the ICMP packets, but
   MUST NOT include information that has the corresponding bitflag
   cleared.

   Even if the authentication fails, the receiver MAY still send the
   regular ICMP reply back to the sender, without the requested or
   internal information, as if this Trace-Ping extension is not
   supported.


6.  Security Considerations

   This extension enhances the security of traceroute and ping operation
   in a backwards-compatible fashion.  The mechanism allows the receiver
   to verify the sender of the traceroute/ping packet such that certain
   sensitive application, interface and network related information can
   be supplied in the internal network or across trusted networks.

   The use of Cryptographic authentication (i.e., an Auth Type value of
   2) allows for a strong authentication mechanism since the keys cannot
   be discerned by intercepting the packets.  The proposed Keyed
   authentication does not prevent replay attacks.  However, in the case
   of replay attacks, since the packet source IP/IPv6 address of the
   traceroute/ping probe can not be changed, there is no easy way for
   the attacker to retrieve the ICMP messages.

   A router needs to protect against purposefully-bogus Traceroute
   packets with extensions that fail the authentication, as a high rate
   of messages can require significant processing time.  [RFC1812]
   specifies how rate-limiting is applied to the generation of ICMP
   messages, and this rate-limiting deters the threat when applied
   before checking the Authentication.  Additionally, when using
   Cryptographic authentication, the HMAC includes the source IP
   address, which means the HMAC will not validate if the traceroute/
   ping packet is sent over a NAT.


7.  IANA Considerations

   The Trace-Ping Extension contains Trace-Ping Objects.  IANA is
   requested to assign a new Class-Num for the Trace-Ping extension, and
   a sub-registry under Trace-Ping extension to include c-types.  This
   document has defined c-type 1 and 2 for authentication and
   information-request objects. c-types 3-0xF6 are allocated through
   Expert Review [RFC5226].  C-types 0xF7 to 0xFF are reserved for
   private use.

   IANA should also establish a registry for Trace-Ping Info-Request
   Bits under the information-request sub-registry.  This document
   defines bits 0 - 5 in Section 4.1.2.2.  Bits 6-29 are allocated
   through Expert Review.  Bits 30 - 31 are reserved for private use.
