    <abstract>
      <t>Message redirection is a basic capability provided by the Diameter
      base protocol. In its conventional form, message redirection is performed
      by an application-independent "redirect agent", which returns one or more
      individual hosts to the message sender as possible destinations of the
      redirected message. </t> 
      
      <t>However, in some circumstances an operator may wish to redirect
      messages to an alternate domain without specifying individual hosts. This
      document specifies an application-specific mechanism by which that can be
      achieved. New applications may incorporate this capability by reference to
      the  present document. </t> 
      
      <t>Because the redirection mechanism is application-specific, it must be
      performed by a Diameter server or proxy rather than a basic redirect agent
      as defined in the Diameter base protocol. A new term, "Realm-based
      Redirect Server", is introduced in this document to differentiate the
      application-specific nature of realm-based redirection from the
      conventional Diameter redirection performed by a basic redirect agent.</t> 
      
      <t>This memo updates Sections 6.13 and 6.14 of RFC6733 with respect
      to the usage of the Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time
      AVPs.</t>

<section title="Introduction">
    
  <t>The Diameter base protocol <xref target="RFC6733"/> specifies a basic
  redirection service provided by redirect agent. The redirect indication
  returned by the redirect agent is described in Section 6.1.8 and Sections
  6.12-6.14 of <xref target="RFC6733"/>, and provides to the message sender one
  or more individual hosts as destination of the redirected message.</t> 
  
  <t>However, consider the case where an operator has offered a specific service
  but no longer wishes to do so. The operator has arranged for an alternative
  domain to provide the service. To aid in the transition to the new
  arrangement, the original operator maintains a redirect server to indicate to
  the message sender the alternative domain to which redirect the request.
  However, the original operator should be relieved from configuring in the
  redirect server a list of hosts to contact in the alternative operator's
  domain, and should simply be able to provide redirect indications to the
  domain as a whole. </t> 
    
  <section title="Terminology">
   
    <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
    target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
    
    <t> Within this specification, the term "realm-based redirection" is used to
    refer to a mode of operation where a realm rather than an individual host is
    returned as redirect indication.</t>
    
    <t>The term "Realm-based Redirect Server" denotes the Diameter node
    (Diameter server or proxy) that returns the realm-based redirection. The
    behaviour of the Realm-based Redirect Server itself is a slight modification
    of the behaviour of a basic redirect agent as described in Section 6.1.8 of
    <xref target="RFC6733"/>.</t> 
    
  </section>

<section anchor="applic" title="Support of Realm-Based Redirection
                    Within Applications">

  <t>Because realm-based redirection is not part of the Diameter base protocol
  <xref target="RFC6733"/>, support of realm-based redirection MUST be specified
  as part of functionality supported by a Diameter application. In this way,
  support of the considered Diameter application (discovered during capabilities
  exchange procedures as defined in Diameter base protocol <xref
  target="RFC6733"/>) indicates implicit support of the realm-based redirection
  mechanism. Designers of new applications can incorporate the mechanism
  specified here into their application by normative reference to this document.
  </t> 

  <t>The result of making realm-based redirection an application-specific
  behaviour is that it cannot be performed by a redirect agent as defined in
  <xref target="RFC6733"/>, but MUST be performed instead by an application-aware
  Diameter node (Diameter server or proxy) (hereafter called a "Realm-based
  Redirect Server").</t> 
   
  <t>An application can specify that realm-based redirection operates only on
  complete sessions beginning with the initial message, or on every message
  within the application, even if earlier messages of the same session were not
  redirected. This distinction matters only when realm-based redirection is
  first initiated. In the former case, existing sessions will not be disrupted
  by the deployment of realm-based redirection. In the latter case, existing
  sessions will be disrupted if they are stateful.</t>

<section anchor="solution" title="Realm-Based Redirection">

  <t>This section specifies an extension of the Diameter base protocol <xref
  target="RFC6733"/> to achieve realm-based redirection. The elements of this
  solution are: 
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>a new result code, DIAMETER_REALM_REDIRECT_INDICATION (3xxx
    TBD1);</t>

    <t>a new attribute-value pair (AVP), Redirect-Realm (code TBD2); and </t> 

    <t>associated behaviour at Diameter nodes implementing this
    specification. </t>
  </list>
  This behaviour includes the optional use of the Redirect-Host-Usage and
  Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVPs. In this document, these AVPs apply to the peer
  discovered by a node acting on the redirect server's response, an extension to
  their normal usage as described in Sections 6.13 and 6.14 of <xref
  target="RFC6733"/>.  </t> 
  
  <t><xref target="proxy_behav"/> and <xref target="cli_behav"/> describe how a
  proxy or client may update its routing table for the application and initial
  realm, as a result of selecting a peer in the new realm after realm-based
  redirection. Note that as a result, the proxy or client will automatically
  route subsequent requests for that application to the new realm (with the
  possible exception of requests within sessions already established with the
  initial realm) until the cached routing entry expires. This should be borne in
  mind if the rerouting is intended to be temporary. </t> 
  
  <section anchor="config" title="Configuration of the Realm-based Redirect Server">

    <t>A Diameter node (Diameter server or proxy) acting as Realm-based Redirect
    Server MUST be configured as follows to execute realm-based redirection: 
    <list style="symbols">
      <t>configured with an application that incorporates realm-based 
      redirection;</t>
      
      <t>the Local Action field of the routing table described in Section 2.7
      of <xref target="RFC6733"/> is set to LOCAL; </t>
      
      <t>an application-specific field is set to indicate that the required 
      local action is to perform realm-based redirection;</t>
      
      <t>an associated application-specific field is configured with the 
      identities of one or more realms to which the request should be
      redirected.</t>
    </list>
    </t>

  <section anchor="behav" title="Behaviour of Diameter Nodes">
  
    <section anchor="redAgent_behav" title="Behaviour at the Realm-based Redirect Server">
    
      <t>As mentioned in <xref target="applic"/>, an application can specify
      that realm-based redirection operates only on complete sessions beginning
      with the initial message (i.e., to prevent disruption of established
      sessions), or on every message within the application, even if earlier
      messages of the same session were not redirected. </t> 

      <t>If a Realm-based Redirect Server configured as described in <xref
      target="config"/> receives a request to which realm-based redirection
      applies, the Realm-based Redirect Server MUST reply with an answer message
      with the 'E' bit set, while maintaining the Hop-by-Hop Identifier in the
      header. The Realm-based Redirect Server MUST include the Result-Code AVP
      set to DIAMETER_REALM_REDIRECT_INDICATION. The Realm-based Redirect Server
      MUST also include the alternate realm identifier(s) with which it has been
      configured, each in a separate Redirect-Realm AVP instance.</t> 
  
      <t>The Realm-based Redirect Server MAY include a copy of the 
      Redirect-Host-Usage AVP, which SHOULD be set to REALM_AND_APPLICATION. If
      this AVP is added, the Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVP MUST also be included.
      Note that these AVPs apply to the peer discovered by a node acting on the
      Realm-based Redirect Server's response, as described in the next section.
      This is an extension of their normal usage as described by Sections 6.13
      and 6.14 of <xref target="RFC6733"/>. 
      <list style="empty">
        <t>Realm-based redirection MAY be applied even if a Destination-Host AVP
        is present in the request, depending on the operator-based policy.</t>

      <t>A proxy conforming to this specification that receives an answer
      message with the Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER_REALM_REDIRECT_INDICATION
      MUST attempt to reroute the original request to a server in a realm
      identified by a Redirect-Realm AVP instance in the answer message, and if
      it fails MUST forward the indication toward the client. To reroute the
      request, it MUST take the following actions: 
      <list style="numbers">
      
        <t>Select a specific realm from amongst those identified in instances
        of the Redirect-Realm AVP in the answer message.</t>

        <t>If successful, locate and establish a route to a peer in the
        realm given by the Redirect-Realm AVP, using normal discovery
        procedures as described in Section 5.2 of <xref target="RFC6733"/>.
        </t>

        <t> If again successful: 
        <list style="letters">
          <t>update its cache of routing entries for the realm and application
          to which the original request was directed, taking into account the
          Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVPs, if present in
          the answer.</t>

          <t>Remove the Destination-Host (if present) and Destination-Realm AVPs
          from the original request and add a new Destination-Realm AVP
          containing the realm selected in the initial step.</t>

          <t>Forward the modified request.</t>
        </list>
        </t>
        
        <t>If either of the preceding steps 2-3 fail and additional realms have
        been identified in the original answer, select another instance of the
        Redirect-Realm AVP in that answer and repeat steps 2-3 for the realm
        that it identifies.</t>

      some other result from a realm differing from the one to which it sent
      the original request. In the case where it receives
      DIAMETER_REALM_REDIRECT_INDICATION, the client SHOULD follow the same

  <t>Realm-based redirection implies a change of the business relationships

   the path toward the realm identified in the realm-based redirect
   indication. To perform these authorization checks, recommendations
   given in section 13 of the Diameter base protocol <xref target="RFC6733"/> apply.</t>
