Internet-Draft         LDP Extensions for PW LI&LB            March 2012


1.  Introduction

   The requirements of Lock Instruct (LI) and Loopback (LB) are
   specified in [RFC5860], and the framework of LI and LB is specified
   in [RFC6371].  [RFC6435] defines in-band Lock Instruct (LI) and
   Loopback (LB) functions, which leverages the Generic Associated
   Channel (GACH) and Generic Associated Channel Label (GAL) [RFC5586]
   and the management plane to perform LI function and use the
   management plane to perform LB function.  In-band and Management
   based LI and LB is suitable for scenarios where control plane is not
   used.

   When a dynamic control plane is used for establishing MPLS-TP PWs,
   it's natural to use and extend the control plane protocol to
   provision LI and LB functions.  Unlike other OAM mechanisms, LI and
   LB would modify the forwarding plane of a PW, thus without the
   involvement of control plane this may result in inconsistency between
   control plane and data plane.  Besides, with control plane based
   mechanism, it does not need to rely on the TTL expiration to make the
   LI/LB requests to reach particular MIP or MEP.

   This document specifies extensions to LDP to implement LI and LB for
   MPLS-TP PWs when MPLS-TP control plane is used.  The mechanisms
   defined in this document are complementary to [RFC6435].


2.  LDP Extensions

2.1.  Extensions to MPLS-TP PW OAM Administration TLV

   Two new flags (Lock bit and Loopback bit) are defined in MPLS-TP PW
   OAM Administration TLV [I-D.ietf-pwe3-oam-config].

   Format of extended MPLS-TP PW OAM Administration TLV is as below:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |0|0|          Type (TBD)     |            Length               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |I|A|K|B|                  Reserved                             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Lock (K): When this bit is set, it indicates that the T-PE needs to
   enable "Lock" function for this PW.

   Loopback (B): When this bit is set, it indicates that the target node
   of this message SHOULD enable loopback function for this PW.

2.2.  Extensions to PW Status TLV

   Two new Status bits are defined in PW Status TLV:
   Bit Mask     Description
   ====================================================================
   0x00000020   Pseudowire in Lock Mode                 [this document]
   0x00000040   Pseudowire in Loopback Mode             [this document]


3.  Operations

   The control plane based Lock Instruct and Loopback functions are
   applicable to both Single-Segment Pseudowire (SS-PW) [RFC3985]
   [RFC4447] and Multi-Segment Pseudowire (MS-PW) [RFC5659] [RFC6073].

3.1.  Lock Instruct

   When a PE/T-PE wants to put a PW in lock mode, it MUST send a Mapping
   message with the Lock (K) bit in the MPLS-TP PW OAM Administration
   TLV set.

   For SS-PW, when the Mapping message arrives at the remote PE, the
   receiving PE SHOULD try to take the PW out of service.  If the
   receiving PE locks the PW successfully, it SHOULD sent a Notification
   message with PW status "Pseudowire in Lock Mode".  Otherwise, it
   SHOULD send a Notification message with the LDP Status code set to
   "Lock Failure" , and the Status bit "Pseudowire in Lock Mode" MUST be
   cleared.

   For MS-PW, when the Mapping message arrives at a downstream S-PE, the
   receiving S-PE SHOULD forward this Mapping message downstream towards
   the remote T-PE.  When the Mapping message arrives at the remote
   T-PE, it SHOULD try to take the PW out of service.  If the receiving
   T-PE locks the PW successfully, it SHOULD send a Notification message
   with PW status "Pseudowire in Lock Mode" to the upstream S-PE.
   Otherwise, it SHOULD send a Notification message with the LDP Status
   code set to "Lock Failure" , and the Status bit "Pseudowire in Lock
   Mode" MUST be cleared.  On receipt of the Notification message, the
   S-PEs would know whether the MS-PW is locked successfully, and the
   S-PEs SHOULD forward the Notification message back to the Source
   T-PE.

   When the PE/T-PE wants to take the PW out of the lock mode, it MUST
   send a Mapping message with the Lock (K) bit in the MPLS-TP PW OAM
   Administration TLV cleared.  The receiving PE/T-PE SHOULD try to
   unlock the PW.  If the PW is unlocked successfully, the receiving PE/
   T-PE SHOULD send a Notification message with PW status bit
   "Pseudowire in Lock Mode" cleared.  Otherwise, it SHOULD send a

   Notification message with the LDP Status code set to "Unlock
   Failure", and the Status bit "Pseudowire in Lock Mode" MUST be set.

3.2.  Loopback

   When a PE/T-PE wants to put the remote PE/T-PE of a PW into loopback
   mode, it MUST send a Mapping message with both the Lock (K) bit and
   Loopback (B) bit in the MPLS-TP PW OAM Administration TLV set.  When
   a T-PE wants to put a particular S-PE of the PW into loopback mode,
   it MUST send a Mapping message with both the Lock (K) bit and
   Loopback (B) bit set, and a PW Switching Point PE TLV(SP-PE TLV)
   [RFC6073] identifying the Target S-PE SHOULD be carried in the
   Mapping message.

   When the Mapping message arrives at the remote PE/T-PE, the receiving
   PE SHOULD try to put the PW in loopback mode.  If the receiver node
   puts the PW into loopback mode successfully, it SHOULD send a
   Notification message with PW status "Pseudowire in Loopback Mode".
   Otherwise, it SHOULD send a Notification message with the LDP Status
   code set to "Enter Loopback Failure" , and the Status bit "Pseudowire
   in Loopback Mode" MUST be cleared.

   When the Mapping message arrives at the targeted S-PE, the S-PE
   SHOULD try to put the PW in loopback mode.  If the S-PE puts the PW
   into loopback mode successfully, it SHOULD send a Notification
   message with PW status set to "Pseudowire in Loopback Mode".  An
   SP-PE TLV identifying the S-PE in loopback mode SHOULD also be
   carried in the Notification message.  If the S-PE fails to put the PW
   into loopback mode, it SHOULD send a Notification message with the
   LDP Status code set to "Enter Loopback Failure" , and the Status bit
   "Pseudowire in Loopback Mode" MUST be cleared.  An SP-PE TLV SHOULD
   also be carried in the Notification message.

   When the PE/T-PE wants to take the remote PE/T-PE out of the loopback
   mode, it MUST send a Mapping message with the Lock (K) bit set and
   Loopback (B) bit cleared.  When the T-PE wants to take a particular
   S-PE out of loopback mode, the message SHOULD also carry the SP-PE
   TLV which identifies the target S-PE.  If the PW is taken out of
   loopback mode successfully, the receiving PE/T-PE/S-PE SHOULD send a
   Notification message with PW status bit "Pseudowire in Loopback Mode"
   cleared.  Otherwise, it SHOULD send a Notification message with the
   LDP Status code set to "Exit Loopback Failure" , and the Status bit
   "Pseudowire in Loopback Mode" MUST still be set.  For the S-PE case,
   An SP-PE TLV identifying the S-PE SHOULD also be carried in the
   Notification message.

4.  IANA Considerations

   Two bits ("Lock" (K) and "Loopback" (B)) as defined in section 2.1
   need to be allocated in the MPLS-TP PW OAM Administration TLV.

   Two new PW Status bits as defined in section 2.2 need to be allocated
   in the "Pseudowire Status Codes" Registry.

   Four new LDP status codes need be assigned by the IANA in the LDP
   "STATUS CODE NAME SPACE":

   Range/Value   E    Description
   TBA           0    Lock Failure
   TBA           0    Unlock Failure
   TBA           0    Enter Loopback Failure
   TBA           0    Exit Loopback Failure
