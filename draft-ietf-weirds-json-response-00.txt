Internet-Draft             RDAP JSON RESPONSES            September 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document describes responses in the JSON [RFC4627] format for
   the RESTful web queries as defined by UNIFIED-RDAP-QUERY
   [I-D.ietf-weirds-rdap-query].  The signalling for JSON, JSON naming
   scheme, JSON namespace and extension mechanism and normalized
   references to other specifications are documented in RDAP-HTTP
   [I-D.ietf-weirds-using-http].

   The data model for the responses consists of two major categories:
   responses returned by Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) for
   registrations data related to IP addresses, reverse DNS names, and
   Autonomous System numbers; and responses returned by Domain Name
   Registries (DNRs) for registration data related to forward DNS names.
   Where overlap exists between RIR and DNR reponse object classes, the
   RIR object classes are a proper subset of the DNR object classes.
   The current division between RIR and DNR object classes is given to
   illustrate an expectation of what data may be expected from an RIR vs
   a DNR.  However, implementers should be aware that RIRs are not
   limited to the data in the RIR object classes (as an example, some
   RIRs have a notion of "status" for entities as defined in the DNR
   entity object class and may at some point start publishing that
   data).

   Object classes defined in this document do not represent the full
   range of data that any registry may wish to publish.  RDAP-HTTP
   [I-D.ietf-weirds-using-http] defines a JSON extension mechanism that
   maybe used by registries to insert registry specific data values.

2.  Terminology and Definitions

   The following list describes terminology and definitions used
   throughout this document:

   DNR:              "Domain Name Registry".

   member:           data found with in an object as defined by JSON
                     [RFC4627].

   object:           a data structure as defined by JSON [RFC4627].

   object class:     the definition of members that may be found in JSON
                     objects described in this document.

   object instance:  an instantiation or specific instance of an object
                     class.

   RDAP:             "Registry Data Access Protocol".

   RIR:              "Regional Internet Registry".

3.  Common Data Types

   JSON [RFC4627] defines the data types of a number, character string,
   boolean, array, object and null.  This section describes the
   semantics and/or syntax reference for data types used in this
   document derived from the JSON character string.

   'handle':   DNRs and RIRs have registry-unique identifiers that may
      be used to specifically reference an object instance.  The
      semantics of this data type as found in this document is to be a
      registry-unique reference to the closest enclosing object where
      the value is found.  The data type names 'registryId', 'roid',
      'nic-handle', 'registrationNo', etc... are terms often synomous
      with this data type.  In this document, the term 'handle' is used.
      The term exposed to users by clients is a presentation issue
      beyond the scope of this document.

   IPv4 addresses:   The representation of IPv4 addresses in this
      document uses the dotted-decimal notation described in [RFC1166].
      An example of this textual representation is '192.0.2.0'.

   IPv6 addresses:   The representation of IPv6 addresses in this
      document follow the forms outlined in [RFC5952].  An example of
      this textual representation is '2001:db8::1:0:0:1'.

   country codes:   Where the identity of a geopolitical nation or
      country is needed, these identities are represented with the
      alpha-2 or 2 character country code designation as defined in
      [ISO.3166.1988].  The alpha-2 representation is used because it is
      freely available whereas the alpha-3 and numeric-3 standards are
      not.

   domain names:   Textual representations of DNS names follow the rules
      set forth in [RFC4343], specifically the case insensitivity and
      character escaping rules.  Trailing periods are optional for both
      input and output.

   email addresses:   Textual representations of email addresses follow
      the syntax defined in [RFC5322].

   dates and times:   The syntax for values denoting dates and times is
      defined in [RFC3339].

   URIs:   The syntax for values denoting a Uniform Resource Identifier
      (URI) is defined by [RFC3986].

4.  The Entity Object Class

   The entity object class appears throughout this document and is an
   appropriate response for the /entity/XXXX query defined in UNIFIED-
   RDAP-QUERY [I-D.ietf-weirds-rdap-query].  This object class
   represents the information of organizations, corporations,
   governments, non-profits, clubs, individual persons, and informal
   groups of people.  All of these representations are so similar that
   it is best to represent them in JSON [RFC4627] with one construct,
   the entity object class, to aid in the re-use of code by
   implementers.

   Many of the members of the entity object class are repeated in other
   object classes described later in this document.

5.  The Nameserver Object Class

   The nameserver object class is used by both RIRs and DNRs.  Unlike
   other object classes used by both registries where the RIR object
   class is a subset of the DNR object class, a clear delineation is not
   made with the nameserver object class because some DNRs have the same
   or a similar registration model as the RIRs.  RIRs and some DNRs
   register or expose nameserver information as an attribute of a domain
   name, while other DNRs model nameservers as "first class objects".

   The nameserver object class accomodates both models and degrees of
   variation in between.

   The following is an example of a nameserver object.


     {
       "handle" : "XXXX",
       "name" : "ns1.example.com",
       "status" : "active",
       "ipAddresses" : [ "192.0.2.0", "192.0.2.1" ],
       "remarks" :
       [
         "she sells seas shells",
         "down by the seashore"
       ],
       "uris" :
       [
         {
           "type" : "source",
           "uri" : "http://example.net/nameserver/xxxx"
         }
       ],
       "port43" : "whois.example.net",
       "registrationDate" : "1990-12-31T23:59:60Z",
       "registrationBy" : "ABC123",
       "lastChangedDate" : "1990-12-31T23:59:60Z",
       "lastChangedBy" : "ABC123",
       "sponsoredBy" : "SponsorXYZ",
       "resoldBy" : "ResellerPDQ"
     }


                                 Figure 1

   Figure 1 is an example of a nameserver object with all values given.
   Registries using a first-class nameserver data model would embed this
   in domain objects as well as allowing references to it with the

   /nameserver query type (all depending on the registry operators
   policy).  Other registries may pare back the information as needed.
   Figure 2 is an example of a nameserver object as would be found in
   RIRs and some DNRs, while Figure 3 is an example of a nameserver
   object as would be found in other DNRs.

   The following is an example of the simplest nameserver object.


     {
       "name" : "ns1.example.com"
     }


                                 Figure 2

   The following is an example of a simple nameserver object that might
   be commonly used by DNRs.


     {
       "name" : "ns1.example.com",
       "ipAddresses" : [ "192.0.2.0", "192.0.2.1" ]
     }


                                 Figure 3

   The nameserver object class has the following members:

   o  handle -- a string representing an registry unique identifier of
      the nameserver

   o  name -- a string containing the DNS name of the nameserver

   o  ipAddresses -- an array of strings containing IPv4 and/or IPv6
      addresses of the nameserver

   The members "status", "remarks", "uris", "port43", "sponsoredBy",
   "resoldBy", "registrationBy", "registrationDate", "lastChangedDate",
   and "lastChangedBy" take the same form of the members of the same
   name of the entity object (Section 4).

6.  The Domain Object Class

   The domain object class represents a DNS name and point of
   delegation.  For RIRs these delegation points are in the reverse DNS
   tree, whereas for DNRs these delegation points are in the forward DNS
   tree.  The RIR domain object class is a subset of the DNR object
   class.

   In both cases, the high level structure of the domain object class
   consists of information about the domain registration, nameserver
   information related to the domain name, and entities related to the
   domain name (e.g. registrant information, contacts, etc...).

   The following is an elided example of the domain object showing the
   high level structure.


   {
     "handle" : "XXX",
     "name" : "blah.example.com",
     ...
     "nameServers" :
     [
       ...
     ],
     ...
     "entities" :
     [
       ...

7.  The IP Network Object Class

   The IP Network object class models IP network registrations found in
   RIRs and is the expected response for the /ip query as defined by
   [I-D.ietf-weirds-rdap-query].  There is no equivalent object class
   for DNRs.  The high level structure of the IP network object class
   consists of information about the network registration and entities
   related to the IP network (e.g. registrant information, contacts,
   etc...).

   The following is an elided example of the IP network object type
   showing the high level structure.


   {
     "handle" : "XXX",
     ...

   The following is a description of the members of this object:

   o  handle -- a string representing an RIR unique identifier of the
      network registration

   o  startAddress -- the starting IP address of the network, either
      IPv4 or IPv6

   o  endAddress -- the ending IP address of the network, either IPv4 or
      IPv6

   o  ipVersion -- an integer signifying the IP protocol version of the
      network: 4 signifying an IPv4 network, 6 signifing an IPv6 network

   o  name -- an identifier assigned to the network registration by the
      registration holder

   o  description -- an array of strings containing descriptive text
      about the network registration

   o  type -- a string containing an RIR specific classification of the
      network

   o  country -- a string containing the name of the 2 character country
      code of the network

   o  parentHandle -- a string containing an RIR unique identifier of
      the parent network of this network registration

   o  entities -- an array of entity objects as defined by Section 4.1.

   The members "remarks", "uris", "registrationDate", "lastChangedDate",
   and "lastChangedBy" take the same form of the members of the same
   name of the entity object (Section 4.1).

8.  Autonomous System Number Entity Object Class

   The Autonomous System Number (autnum) object class models Autonomous
   System Number registrations found in RIRs and represents the expected
   response to an /autnum query as defined by
   [I-D.ietf-weirds-rdap-query].  There is no equivalent object class
   for DNRs.  The high level structure of the autnum object class
   consists of information about the network registration and entities
   related to the autnum registration (e.g. registrant information,
   contacts, etc...), and is similar to the IP Network entity object
   class.

   The following is an example of a JSON object representing an autnum.

Appendix A.  Suggested Values

   Due to the wide variation between the hundreds of registry operators
   and the on-going policy refinement by registry communities, values of
   some data cannot be formally standardized.  This section lists
   suggested values for such data but is not nor will ever be a complete
   list of values and their meanings.

A.1.  Status

   Many of the object classes have a member named 'status'.  This member
   is an array of strings, with each string denoting a status associated
   with the containing object.  The following is a list of suggested
   values to use in the 'status' array:

   o  'validated' -- Signifies that the data of the object instance has
      been found to be accurate.  This type of status is usually found
      on entity object instances to note the validity of identifying
      contact information.

   o  'update prohibited' -- Updates to the object instance are
      forbidden.

   o  'transfer prohibited' -- Transfers of the registration from one
      registrar to another are forbidden.  This type of status normally
      applies to DNR domain names.

   o  'delete prohibited' -- Deletion of the registration of the object
      instance is forbidden.  This type of status normally applies to
      DNR domain names.

A.2.  Roles

   Entity object classes have a member named 'roles'.  This member is an
   array of strings, with each string indicating the role or
   relationship the entity object instance has with a containing object,
   such as a domain name or IP network.  An entity object instance can
   have more than one type of relationship with a containing object.
   The following is a list of suggested values to use in the 'roles'
   array:

   o  'registrant' -- The entity object instance is the registrant of
      the registration.

   o  'tech' -- The entity object instance is a technical contact for
      the registration.

Internet-Draft             RDAP JSON RESPONSES            September 2012


   o  'admin' -- The entity object instance is an administrative contact
      for the registraton.

   o  'abuse' -- The entity object instance handles network abuse issues
      on behalf of the registrant of the registration.

   o  'billing' -- The entity object instance handles payment and
      billing issues on behalf of the registrant of the registration.

   o  'registrar' -- The entity object instance represents the authority
      responsible for the registration in the registry.

A.3.  URI Types

   Many of the object classes have a member named 'uris', which is an
   array of objects with each object containing a 'type' string and a
   'uri' string.  These URIs represent a location to find information
   about the containing object.  The following is a list of suggested
   values to use as a 'type' string for an associated URI.

   o  'self' -- Indicates the URI is a direct reference to the object
      instance via an RDAP query.

   o  'parent' -- Indicates a direct reference to an object instance's
      parent via an RDAP query.  Such a reference might be used in an IP
      network to reference the next IP network up the tree of IP address
      hierarchies.

   o  'source' -- Signifies a direct reference to the registration in
      another RESTful protocol.  As an example, both ARIN and the RIPE
      NCC have RESTful web services for WHOIS data that pre-exists RDAP.
      This type of URI would be used to reference the same data in such
      a system.

   o  'web' -- Signifies the web site of the containing object instance.
      The expectation is that a web browser would be needed to use this
      URI.

   o  'rdap' -- Signifies the RDAP service where RDAP queries can be
      issued.

   o  'held' -- Signifies a HELD location service for the registered
      object.

   o  'geo' -- Signifies that the URI is a geo URI related to the
      location of the registration.

Appendix B.  Suggested Data Modeling with the Entity Object Class

B.1.  Registrants and Contacts

   This document does not provide specific object classes for
   registrants and contacts.  Instead the entity object class may be
   used to represent a registrant or contact.  When the entity object is
   embedded inside a containing object such as a domain name or IP
   network, the 'roles' string array can be used to signify the
   relationship.  It is recommended that the values from Appendix A.2 be
   used.

   The following is an example of an elided containing object with an
   embedded entity that is both a registrant and admin contact:


   {
     ...
     "entities" :
     [
       {
         "handle" : "XXXX",
         "names": [ "Joe Bob, Inc.", "Bobby Joe Shopping" ],
         "roles" : [ "registrant", "admin" ],
         "postalAddress" :
         [
           "123 Maple Ave",
           "Suite 90001",
           "Vancouver",
           "BC",
           "12393"
         ],
         "emails" : [ "joe@bob.com", "bob@joe.com" ],
         "phones" :
         {
           "office" : [ "999-999-999-99", "111-111-111-11" ],
           "fax" :    [ "222-222-222-22" ],
           "mobile" : [ "333-333-333-33" ]
         },
         "remarks" :
         [
           "she sells seas shells",
           "down by the seashore"
         ],
         "registrationDate" : "1990-12-31T23:59:60Z",
         "lastChangedDate" : "1990-12-31T23:59:60Z",
         "lastChangedBy" : "joe@bob.com"
       }

     ]
   }


B.2.  Registrars

   This document does not provide a specific object class for
   registrars, but like registrants and contacts (see Appendix B.1) the
   'roles' string array maybe used.  Additionally, a URI type can
   signify the registrars point of service (see Appendix A.3).

           "mobile" : [ "333-333-333-33" ]
         },
         "remarks" :
         [
           "we registrar for less!"
         ],
         "uris" :

Appendix C.  IDN Query and Response Model

   Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) differ from other types of
   domain names because multiple domain names as would be represented by
   a name in Master File format (see [RFC4343]) may be registered by a
   single IDN.  IDNs are based on Unicode, and Unicode can have multiple
   means for encoding the same word depending on the character set and
   language being used.  And the rules for determining which IDN
   encoding maps to a "wire-format" domain name vary from DNR to DNR.

   When an IDN maps to multiple domain names, the various mappings are
   called variants.  The DNR Domain object class (Section 6.2)
   represents the variants using a string array.

   The following is an example of an elided DNR domain object with
   variants.


   {
     "handle" : "XXXX",
     "name" : "blah.example.com",
     "variants" : [ "blah2.example.com", "blah3.example.com" ],
     ...
   }


   Because IDNs can have multiple targets in a mapping and due to the
   variance in DNR mapping rules, it is up to the client to reduce an
   IDN to a domain name in Master File format so as to narrow the lookup
   of the domain name to the proper subset.  A query of a DNR using the
   IDN itself might map across multiple registrations depending on the
   mapping rules of the DNR.

Appendix D.  Postal Addresses vs Location

   The postal address data listed in the entity object class (Section 4)
   does not necessarily represent location.  The intent of this
   information is to provide a means to send postal mail to an entity.
   While in some cases it may also be the location of the entity, there
   is no gaurantee that the two are the same.  Accurate representation
   of location is topic unto itself, and registries wishing to show
   location of object instances should use the 'geo' or 'held' URI types
   as meantioned in Appendix A.3.

   Additionally, the postal address data represented in this document
   does not follow any specific standard for postal addresses because
   many registries do not keep postal address data in an
   internationalized standard form.  Publication of such data in a
   format that suggests an internationalized standard form when such
   data is not known to be well-formed for that purpose would be
   misleading.
