            Extended IPv6 Addressing for Encoding Port Range
                   draft-bcx-address-fmt-extension-02

Abstract

   This document discusses an extension of the algorithmic translation
   between IPv4 and IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses.  The extended
   address format contains transport-layer port range information which
   allows several IPv6 nodes to share a single IPv4 address with each
   node managing a different range of ports.  This address format
   extension can be used for IPv4/IPv6 translation, as well as IPv4 over
   IPv6 tunneling.

Internet-Draft          Extended IPv6 Addressing              April 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document discusses an extension of the address format defined in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format].  The original address format
   document specifies how an individual IPv6 address is translated to a
   corresponding IPv4 address, and vice versa, in cases where an
   algorithmic mapping is used.  To face the IPv4 public address
   exhaustion, it is desirable to assign fractional IPv4 addresses to
   IPv6 nodes which can share a single IPv4 address with each node
   managing a different range of ports.

   In [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] Section 3.5, it states:

      "There have been proposals to complement stateless translation
      with a port-range feature.  Instead of mapping an IPv4 address to
      exactly one IPv6 prefix, the options would allow several IPv6
      nodes to share an IPv4 address, with each node managing a
      different range of ports.  If a port range extension is needed, it
      could be defined later, using bits currently reserved as null in
      the suffix."

   This document defines one of such a suffix encoding scheme and the
   corresponding port-range algorithm.

1.1.  Applicability Scope

   The address format extension can be used for both IPv4/IPv6
   translation and IPv4 over IPv6 tunneling.  However, in this document
   we will use IPv4-translatable addresses in the stateless translation
   to discuss this specific address format extension.  The descriptions
   of the other algorithms for their specific use case can be defined
   later.

1.2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Extended IPv4-tranlatable IPv6 Address

   In Section 2.2 of [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format], IPv4-embedded
   IPv6 address format is defined which composed of a variable length
   prefix, the embedded IPv4 address, and a variable length suffix, as
   presented in the following diagram, in which PL designates the prefix
   length:

   It is clear that only Prefix lengths (PL) with 32, 40, 48, 56 and 64
   have suffix portions, with maximum suffix lengths of 56, 48, 40, 32,
   24, respectively.  In order to use different Prefix length and unify
   the port range encoding method, the suffix should be 24 bits or less.
   Furthermore, we choose the port-range coding suffix which is directly
   following the embedded IPv4 address and padding zeros after the
   suffix.

Internet-Draft          Extended IPv6 Addressing              April 2011


                     Figure 2: Address Sharing Scheme

   In the above figure, the IPv4-translatable-0, IPv4-translatable-1,
   IPv4-translatable-2, ..., IPv4-translatable-K are sharing the same
   IPv4 address IPv4-addr, but port number range for different IPv4-
   translatable addresses (i.e. port-range-0, port-range-1, port-range-2
   , port-range-K) are not overlapped.  When an IPv6 node using IPv4-
   translatable addresses communicates with the IPv4 Internet via a
   translator, it looks like a single host using IPv4 address (IPv4-
   addr) communicating with the IPv4 Internet.

   There exist many port-range coding schemes and each one may have its
   advantages and disadvantages, as well as has its best application
   scenario.  In this document, we will introduce a simple one, which we
   believe is suitable for the IPv4/IPv6 stateless translation.  This
   encoding scheme uses the modulus operator to define the port number
   range.

   If the sharing ratio is N, then:

   o  Given K (K=0, 1, ..., N-1), the allowed port number (P) are
      P=j*N + K-1, where j=0, 1, ..., (65536-N)/N.

   o  Given P, the IPv6 node index (K) is
      K=(P%N) (% is the Modulus Operator).

   For example, If N=128, then IPv6 node K=5 is only allowed to use port
   numbers 5, 133, 261, 389, 517, 645, 773, 901, ... 65,413 as the
   source port, while the packets with these port numbers as the
   destination port number will be send to IPv6 node K=5.

   The modulus operator has several features:

   1.  The port ranges are not overlapped for different IPv6 nodes.

   2.  The individual ports for each IPv6 node are not continues and the
       whole 65536 port range is equally shared by IPv6 nodes.

   3.  The port number range can be uniquely determined by given sharing
       ratio (N) and the IPv6 node index (K).

   Based on the modulus operator, We need to encode N and K in the
   suffix as an extended IPv4-translatable IPv6 address.

2.2.  Extended Address Format

   Since the transport port number is a 16 bit integer, the sharing
   ratio (N) and the IPv6 node index (K) can both have the value from 0

   to 65535.  In theory, 32 bits (16 bits for sharing ratio and 16 bits
   for IPv6 node index) are required for encoding the port range based
   on the modulus operation.  In order to fit into 24 bit or less suffix
   range, we need to do compression.

   First, we can use number of bits to represent the sharing ratio when
   the sharing ratio is bit-wise, hence 4 bits is enough for N.

   Secondly, if sharing ratio N is very high, each IPv6 node can only
   use a small number of concurrent sessions.  For example, if N=4096,
   each IPv6 node will have 16 concurrent sessions, which may be too
   small for most of the applications.  Therefore, if we set the maximum
   sharing ratio N=4096, then 12 bits are enough for the IPv6 node
   index.  In this case, we can design suffix which consists of 16 bits
   for encoding the port range.

   Based on the above discussion, the extended address format is shown
   in the following figure.

    |40|     prefix        |v4(24)     | u |(8)| suffix|     zero      |
    +--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |48|     prefix            |v4(16) | u | (16)  | suffix|    zero   |
    +--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    |56|     prefix                |(8)| u |  v4(24)   | suffix| zero  |
    +--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

    +--+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

                     Figure 3: Extended Address Format

   Since different suffixes are more specifics in the original address
   format defined in [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format], the routing
   considerations in that document are also applied here.  Furthermore,
   the port range is embedded in the extended IPv4-translatable IPv6
   addresses and bound to the IPv6 node index (K), therefore the packets
   containing extended IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses as the
   destination can be routed to different IPv6 nodes.

2.3.  Suffix for Port Range Encoding

2.4.  Stateless Suffix Translation Algorithm

   For the stateless translation, the IPv6 nodes are required to follow
   the port number range defined by the extended IPv4- translatable
   address format when communicating with the IPv4 Internet.  The port
   number handling algorithm is:

   o  If the packets are from IPv4 to IPv6, the IPv4 source addresses
      are translated to the IPv4-converted addresses and the source port
      numbers are unchanged before and after translation; the IPv4
      destination addresses are translated to the extended IPv4-
      translatable addresses based on the destination port number and
      the destination port numbers are unchanged before and after
      translation.  Note that this means that only a specific IPv6 node
      can receive the packets for a specific port number.  When it is
      port 80, that specific IPv6 node can setup http redirect service
      for other IPv6 nodes which also provide web services with non-
      standard port numbers (e.g. 81, 82, etc.).

   o  If the packets are from IPv6 to IPv4, the IPv6 source addresses
      and the source port numbers are checked, if the source port number
      matches the port number range defined by the extended IPv4-
      translatable address format, the IPv6 source addresses (which are
      the IPv4-translatable addresses) are translated to the IPv4
      addresses and the source port numbers are unchanged before and
      after translation; the destination IPv6 addresses (which are the
      IPv4-converted addresses) are translated to the IPv4 destination

      addresses and the destination port numbers are unchanged before
      and after translation.  However, if the source port number does
      not match the port number range defined by the extended IPv4-
      translatable address format, the packets will be dropped.

2.5.  Partial-state Suffix Translation Algorithm

   Stateless translation requires that IPv6 nodes generate source port
   number in the range defined by the extended IPv4-translatable
   address.  If this condition does not hold, the partial-state suffix
   translation algorithm can be used.

   The reason we call this partial-state is that:

   o  The address mapping is fully algorithm based, as defined in
      section 3.4.  The states are used for port number mapping only.

   o  There will be no port mapping table created if the the source port
      number from IPv6 to IPv4 is in the range defined by the extended
      IPv4-translatable address.

   o  For the destination port number of the packet from the IPv4 to
      IPv6, there will be no port mapping table created.

   The partial-state suffix translation algorithm can be defined later.

2.6.  ICMP Packet Handling

   The ICMP errors should be translatable using the same algorithm (that
   is, an error such as Destination Unreachable includes the original
   TCP (or UDP) header in the ICMP payload, and the that TCP (or UDP)
   port number can be used to translate the ICMP packet into an IPv6-
   encoded packet and back again.

   Since ICMP echo-request/echo-reply packets only contain
   identification field, not the transport port numbers, similar to NAT,
   special actions can be taken for translating the ICMP echo-request/
   echo-reply packets, which can be defined later.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This memo adds no new IANA considerations.


4.  Security Considerations

   There is no special security consideration.
