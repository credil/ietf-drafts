1.  Introduction

   Autonomous System 0 is listed in the IANA Autonomous System Number
   Registry as "Reserved - May be use to identify non-routed networks"
   ([IANA.AS_Numbers]).

   [I-D.ietf-sidr-iana-objects] specifies that AS number zero in a ROA
   is used to mark an NLRI which is to be marked as Invalid.

   No clear statement that AS 0 was proscribed could be found in any BGP
   specification.

   As at least two implementations discard routes containing AS 0 (and
   to allow approaches such as the above) this document codifies this
   behavior.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Behavior

   A BGP speaker MUST NOT originate or propagate a route with an AS
   number of zero in the AS_PATH, AS4_PATH, AGGREGATOR or AS4_AGGREGATOR
   attributes.  A BGP speaker SHOULD NOT generate or propagate an UPDATE
   with zero in any field where an AS number is expected (for example,
   "4-Octet AS specific Extended Community" [RFC5668]).

   An UPDATE message that contains the AS number of zero in the AS_PATH
   or AS4_PATH attribute MUST be considered as malformed, and be handled
   by the procedures specified in [I-D.ietf-idr-error-handling].

   An UPDATE message that contains the AS number of zero in the
   AGGREGATOR or AS4_AGGREGATOR attribute MUST be considered as
   malformed, and be handled by the procedures specified in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-rfc4893bis].

   As UPDATE with zero in any other field where an AS number is expected
   (for example, "4-Octet AS specific Extended Community" [RFC5668])
   SHOULD be treated as malformed and handled appropriately.

   If a BGP speaker receives zero as the peer AS in an OPEN message, it
   MUST abort the connection and send a NOTIFICATION with Error Code
   "OPEN Message Error" and subcode "Bad Peer AS" (see [RFC4271] Section
   6.2).  A router MUST NOT initiate a connection claiming to be AS

   number zero.


3.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to update the Reference for number 0 in the
   "Autonomous System (AS) Numbers" registry to reference this document.


4.  Security Considerations

   By allowing resource holders to say that AS 0 is the only valid
   origin for a route, we allow them to state that a particular address
   resource is not in use.  By ensuring that all implementations that
   see AS 0 in a route ignore that route, we prevent a malicious party
   from announcing routes containing AS 0 in an attempt to hijack those
   resources.

   In addition, by standardizing the behavior upon reception of an
   AS_PATH (or AS4_PATH) containing AS 0, this document makes the
   behavior better defined, and security gotchas often lurk in the
   undefined spaces.

Appendix A.  Changes / Author Notes.

   [RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication ]

   Draft accepted as IDR Doc, notes reset.  Please see notes for
   draft-wkumari-idr-as0.xml for prior comments.

   Changes -00.

   o  Added AS4_PATH -- Robert Raszuk.
   o  Change "bgp listener" to "bgp speaker" -- Enke Chen
   o  Consistent use of AS_PATH (v., AS-PATH and AS PATH) -- Danny
      McPherson
   o  New text for Sec 2 P1 -- Enke / Keyur / Scudder,
      http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/idr/current/msg05786.html
   o  I made a boo boo -- I had the file open in 2 editors, made changes
      in one and overwrote them by saving on the other, then checked the
      broken one into SVN.  Apologies to all whose comments I may have
      missed...

   Changes -01

   o  The WG thread
      http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/idr/current/msg05685.html
      showed a very strong preference for separating the error
      definition and handling -- the chairs also showed a prefernce to
      Publish this and point to the error handling that Enke will write.

   o  The originally suggested text ("An UPDATE message that contains
      the AS number of zero in the AS-PATH attribute MUST be...") only
      referenced the AS-PATH, readded AS4_PATH, *AGGREGATOR as suggested
      by Robert Raszak and Danny.

   Changes -02

   o  Fixed the refernce for *AGGREGATOR.  This required breaking it out
      into two sentences / clauses.
   o  Added text on other places where an AS can show up (e.g: "4-Octet
      AS specific Extended Community" [RFC5668]) -- thanks to Keyur.
