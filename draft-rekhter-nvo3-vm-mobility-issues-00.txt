1. Specification of requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2. Introduction

   An important feature of data centers identified in [nvo3-problem] is
   the support of Virtual Machine (VM) mobility within the data center
   and between data centers. This document describes a set of network-
   related issues presented by the desire to support seamless Virtual
   Machine mobility in the data center, where seamless mobility is
   defined as the ability to move a VM from one server in the data
   center to another server in the same or different data center, while
   retaining the IP and MAC address of the VM. In the context of this
   document the term mobility, or a reference to moving a VM should be
   considered to imply seamless mobility, unless otherwise stated.

   Note that in the scenario where a VM is moved between servers located
   in different data centers, there are certain issues related to the

   current state of the art of the Virtual Machine technology, the
   bandwidth that may be available between the data centers, the
   distance between the data centers, the ability to manage and operate
   such VM mobility etc.  Discussion of these issues is outside the
   scope of this document



2.1. Terminology

   In this document the term "Top of Rack Switch (ToR)" is used to refer
   to a switch in a data center that is connected to the servers that
   host VMs. A data center may have multiple ToRs.

   Several data centers could be connected by a network. In addition to
   providing interconnect among the data centers, such a network could
   provide connectivity between the VMs hosted in these data centers and
   the sites that contain hosts communicating with such VMs. Each data
   center has one or more Data Center Border Router (DCBR) that connects
   the data center to the network, and provides (a) connectivity between
   VMs hosted in the data center and VMs hosted in other data centers,
   and (b) connectivity between VMs hosted in the data center and hosts
   communicating with these VMs.

   The following figure illustrates the above:

        ----------------------------------------






   The data centers and the network that interconnects them may be
   either (a) under the same administrative control, or (b) controlled
   by different administrations.

   Consider a set of VMs that (as a matter of policy) are allowed to
   communicate with each other, and a collection of devices that
   interconnect these VMs. If communication among any VMs in that set
   could be accomplished in such a way as to preserve MAC source and
   destination addresses in the Ethernet header of the packets exchanged
   among these VMs (as these packets traverse from their sources to
   their destinations), we will refer to such set of VMs as an Layer 2
   based Closed User Group (L2-based CUG).

   A given VM may be a member of more than one L2-based CUG.



Rekhter                                                         [Page 5]


Internet Draftdraft-rekhter-nvo3-vm-mobility-issues-00.txt   August 2012


   In terms of IP address assignment this document assumes that all VMs
   of a given L2-based CUG have their IP addresses assigned out of a
   single IP prefix. Thus, in the context of this document a single IP
   subnet corresponds to a single L2-based CUG. If a given VM is a
   member of more than one L2-based CUG, this VM would have multiple IP
   addresses, one per each such CUG.

   A VM that is a member of a given L2-based CUG may (as a matter of
   policy) be allowed to communicate with VMs that belong to other
   L2-based CUGs, or with other hosts. Such communication involves IP
   forwarding, and thus would result in changing MAC source and
   destination addresses in the Ethernet header of the packets being
   exchanged.

   In this document the term "L2 site" refers to a collection of
   interconnected devices that perform forwarding based on the
   information carried in the Ethernet header. In a non-trivial L2 site
   (site that contains multiple forwarding entities) forwarding could be
   provided by such layer 2 technologies as Spanning Tree Protocol
   (STP), etc...  Note that any multi-chassis LAG is treated as a single
   L2 site - a given multi-chassis LAG has to be contained within a
   single L2 site.  This document assumes that a layer 2 access domain
   is an L2 site.

   A physical server connected to a given L2 site may host VMs that
   belong to different L2-based CUGs (while each of these CUGs may span
   multiple L2 sites). If an L2 site contains servers that host VMs
   belonging to different L2-based CUGs, then enforcing L2-based CUGs
   boundaries among these VMs within that site is accomplished by
   relying on Layer 2 mechanisms (e.g., VLANs).

   We say that an L2 site contains a given VM (or that a given VM is in
   a given L2 site), if the server presently hosting this VM is
   connected to a ToR that is part of that site.

   We say that a given L2-based CUG is present within a given data
   center if one or more VMs that are part of that CUG are presently
   hosted by the servers located in that data center.

   In the context of this document when we talk about VLAN-ID used by a
   given VM, we refer to the VLAN-ID carried by the traffic that is
   within the same L2 site as the VM, and that is either originated or
   destined to that VM.

3. Problem Statement

   This section describes the specific problems/issues that need to be
   addressed to enable seamless VM mobility.


3.1. Usage of VLAN-IDs

   This document assumes that VMs that belong to the same L2-based CUG,
   and are in the same L2 site MUST use the same VLAN-ID. This document
   assumes that VMs that belong to the same L2-based CUG, and are in
   different L2 sites MAY use either the same or different VLAN-IDs.
   Thus when a given VM moves from one L2 site to another, traffic the
   VLAN-ID used by the VM may change, and thus can not assume to stay
   the same.  However, if a given VM's Guest OS sends packets that carry
   VLAN-ID, then when the VM moves from one L2 site to another the VLAN-
   ID used by the Guest OS can not change.

   This document assumes that VMs that belong to different L2-based
   CUGs, and are in the same L2 site MUST use different VLAN-IDs. This
   document assumes that VMs that belong to different L2-based CUGs, and
   are in different L2 sites MAY use either the same, or different VLAN-
   IDs.

   The above assumptions about VLAN-IDs are driven by (a) the assumption
   that within a given L2 site VLANs are used to identify individual
   L2-based CUGs, and (b) the need to overcome the limitation on the
   number of different VLAN-IDs.


3.2. Maintaining Connectivity in the Presence of VM Mobility

   In the context of this document the ability to maintain connectivity
   in the presence of VM mobility means the ability to exchange traffic
   between a VM and its peer(s), as the VM moves from one server to
   another, where the peer(s) may be either other VM(s) or hosts.
   Furthermore, the peer(s) need not be within the same data center as
   the VM itself.


3.3. Layer 2 Extension

   Consider a scenario where a VM that is a member of a given L2-based
   CUG moves from one server to another, and these two servers are in
   different L2 sites, where these sites may be located in the same or
   different data centers. In order to enable communication between this
   VM and other VMs of that L2-based CUG, the new L2 site must become
   interconnected with the other L2 site(s) that presently contain the



Rekhter                                                         [Page 7]


Internet Draftdraft-rekhter-nvo3-vm-mobility-issues-00.txt   August 2012


   rest of the VMs of that CUG, and the interconnect must not violate
   the L2-based CUG requirement to preserve source and destination MAC
   addresses in the Ethernet header of the packets exchange between this
   VM and other members of that CUG.

   Moreover, if the previous site no longer contains any VMs of that
   CUG, the previous site no longer needs to be interconnected with the
   other L2 site(s) that contain the rest of the VMs of that CUG.

   Note that supporting VM mobility implies that the set of L2 sites
   that contain VMs that belong to a given L2-based CUG may change over
   time (new sites added, old sites deleted).

   We will refer to this as the "layer 2 extension problem".

   Note that the layer 2 extension problem is a special case of
   maintaining connectivity in the presence of VM mobility, as the
   former restricts communicating VMs to a single/common L2-based CUG,
   while the latter does not.


3.4. Optimal IP Routing

   In the context of this document optimal IP routing, or just optimal
   routing, in the presence of VM mobility could be partitioned into two
   problems:

     + Optimal routing of a VM's outbound traffic. This means that as a
       given VM moves from one server to another, the VM's default
       gateway should be in a close topological proximity to the ToR
       that connects the server presently hosting that VM. Note that
       when we talk about optimal routing of the VM's outbound traffic,
       we mean traffic from that VM to the destinations that are outside
       of the VM's L2-based CUG. This document refers to this problem as
       the VM default gateway problem.

     + Optimal routing of VM's inbound traffic. This means that as a
       given VM moves from one server to another, the (inbound) traffic
       originated outside of the VM's L2-based CUG, and destined to that
       VM be routed via the router of the VM's L2-based CUG that is in a
       close topological proximity to the ToR that connects the server
       presently hosting that VM, without first traversing some other
       router of that L2-based CUG. This is also known as avoiding
       "triangular routing". This document refers to this problem as the
       triangular routing problem.

   Note that optimal routing is a special case of maintaining
   connectivity in the presence of VM mobility, as the former assumes



Rekhter                                                         [Page 8]


Internet Draftdraft-rekhter-nvo3-vm-mobility-issues-00.txt   August 2012


   not only the ability to maintain connectivity, but also that this
   connectivity is maintained using optimal routing. On the other hand,
   maintaining connectivity does not make optimal routing a pre-
   requisite.


4. IANA Considerations

   This document introduces no new IANA Considerations.


5. Security Considerations

   TBD.
