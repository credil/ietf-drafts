  Support for Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) Events in Sieve
                     draft-ietf-sieve-imap-sieve-03

Abstract

   Sieve defines an email filtering language that can, in principle,
   plug into any point in the processing of an email message.  As
   defined in the base specification, it plugs into mail delivery.  This
   document defines how Sieve can plug into points in the IMAP protocol
   where messages are created or changed, adding the option of user-
   defined or installation-defined filtering (or, with Sieve extensions,
   features such as notifications).

Internet-Draft            IMAP events in Sieve                March 2012


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   Some applications have a need to apply Sieve filters [RFC5228] in
   contexts other than initial mail delivery.  This is especially true
   in diverse service environments, such as when the client is
   sporadically connected, is connected through a high-latency or high-
   cost channel, or is on a limited-function device.  For such clients,
   it may be very important, for higher performance and reliability, to
   take advantage of server capabilities, including those provided by
   Sieve filtering (and Sieve extensions, such as Notify [RFC5435]).

   This specification defines extensions to IMAP [RFC3501] to support
   the invocation of Sieve scripts at times when the IMAP server creates
   new messages or modifies existing ones.  It also defines how Sieve
   scripts will process these invocations.  Support for IMAP events in
   Sieve requires support for IMAP Metadata [RFC5464] and Sieve
   Environment [RFC5183] as well, because Metadata is used to associate
   scripts with IMAP mailboxes and Environment defines an important way
   for Sieve scripts to test the conditions under which they have been
   invoked.

1.2.  Differences Between IMAP Events and Mail Delivery

   Invoking Sieve scripts in a context other than initial mail delivery
   introduces new situations, which changes the applicability of Sieve
   features and creates implementation challenges and user interface
   issues.  This section discusses some of those differences,
   challenges, and issues.

   At times other than message delivery, delivery "envelope"
   information, might not be available.  With messages added through
   IMAP APPEND, there might be no way to even guess who the intended
   recipient is, and no concept of who "sent" the message.  Sieve
   actions that relate to contacting the sender, for example, will not
   be applicable.

   Because IMAP events will often be triggered by user actions, and
   because user interfaces allow bulk actions that differ from
   individual message arrival, it now becomes possible for a single user
   action, such as drag-and-drop, to initiate Sieve script processing on
   a large number of messages at once.  Implementations will have to
   deal with such situations as a "COPY" action or flag changes on
   dozens, or even thousands of messages.

   Other issues might surface as this extension is deployed and
   experience with it develops.

1.3.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to
   be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.4.  Notes from Reviews, and To-Do Items

   [[anchor3: This section should be resolved and removed prior to
   publication.]]



   Stephan Bosch: 4) Invoking the Sieve script linked to the mailbox for
   every possible event seems inefficient, especially when only one
   event (e.g.  APPEND) is of interest.  Whould a means to explicitly
   select which events are applicable for a (mailbox, script) pair be
   useful?

      Barry: We did discuss the general issue of multiple scripts, and I
      had originally planned to have separate scripts for each event
      type ("cause").  In the end, we decided that was too complicated,
      and could be added as a later extension if it turns out to be
      important.

   Stephan Bosch: 6) Allowing redirect seems risky.  What if I
   accidently 'drag' in my mailclient the content of some enormous
   mailing list mailbox to a Sieve-enabled mailbox with a redirect?
   Shouldn't this at least be bounded somehow?

      Barry: I don't know if we can specify what to do -- I don't know
      if we KNOW what to do -- but I've incorporated this into my answer
      to (7), below.

   Stephan Bosch: 7) Since this document essentially defines a whole new
   context in which Sieve scripts can be executed, it can be helpful for
   the reader to have an introductory section that outlines and
   summarizes the main differences between the new and the familiar
   context, e.g. things like the lack of an envelope as pointed out
   earlier on this list, the undesirability of sending responses back to
   senders, etc.

      Barry: I've added a section to the introduction, "Differences
      Between IMAP Events and Mail Delivery".  Please review it, and see
      if there's stuff to add.

   To Do: "Interaction with Metadata": Add text requiring ManageSieve,
   and giving ManageSieve URI in IMAP capability.

2.  The IMAP Events in Sieve Extension

2.1.  The "imapsieve" Capability Strings

   An IMAP server advertises support for IMAP events in Sieve through
   the capability string "imapsieve".  A server that advertises
   "imapsieve" is claiming to be in compliance with this specification
   in all aspects.

   The corresponding Sieve implementation uses the Sieve capability
   string "imapsieve", and Sieve scripts that depend upon the IMAP
   events MUST include that string in their "required" lists.

   Implementations that support IMAP events in Sieve MUST also support
   IMAP Metadata [RFC5464] and Sieve Environment [RFC5183], because
   Metadata is used to associate scripts with IMAP mailboxes and
   Environment defines an important way for Sieve scripts to test the
   conditions under which they have been invoked.  Notwithstanding the
   support requirement, scripts that directly use Environment MUST also
   include its capability string in their "required" lists.

2.2.  Existing IMAP Functions Affected by IMAP events in Sieve

   The subsections below describe in detail the IMAP commands and
   situations on which IMAP events in Sieve have an effect.  Not all
   Sieve actions make sense in the case of messages affected by IMAP
   commands.  See Section 3 for details.

   It's important to note that since the base Sieve specification (see
   [RFC5228]) and its extensions define functions for scripts that are
   invoked during initial mail delivery, those function definitions are
   necessarily tailored to and limited by that context.  This document
   extends those function definitions for use during IMAP events.  By
   nature of that, Sieve functions, in this extended context, may behave
   somewhat differently, though their extended behaviour will still be
   consistent with the functions' goals.

   If more than one message is affected at the same time, each message
   triggers the execution of a Sieve script separately.  The scripts MAY
   be run in parallel.

2.2.1.  The IMAP APPEND Command

   A message may be added to a mailbox through the IMAP APPEND command.
   In a server that advertises "imapsieve", new messages added in this
   way MUST trigger the execution of a Sieve script, subject to the
   settings defined through Metadata (see Section 2.3.1).

Internet-Draft            IMAP events in Sieve                March 2012


2.2.2.  The IMAP MULTIAPPEND Command

   If the IMAP server supports the IMAP MultiAppend extension [RFC3502],
   messages may be added to a mailbox through the IMAP MULTIAPPEND
   command.  In a server that advertises "imapsieve", new messages added
   in this way MUST trigger the execution of a Sieve script, as with the
   APPEND command, also subject to the settings defined through
   Metadata.

2.2.3.  The IMAP COPY Command

   One or more messages may be added to a mailbox through the IMAP COPY
   command.  In a server that advertises "imapsieve", new messages added
   in this way MUST trigger the execution of a Sieve script, subject to
   the settings defined through Metadata.

2.2.4.  Changes to IMAP Message Flags

   One or more existing messages can have their flags changed in a
   number of ways, including:

   o  The FETCH command (may cause the \Seen flag to be set).

   o  The STORE command (may cause the \Answered, \Deleted, \Draft,
      \Flagged, and \Seen flags to be set or reset, and may cause
      keywords to be set or reset).

   o  The invocation of a Sieve script on an existing message, where the
      Sieve implementation supports the IMAP4Flags extension [RFC5232]
      and the script uses one of the actions defined in that extension.

   In a server that advertises "imapsieve", messages whose flags are
   changed in any way (except as explained in the next sentence) MUST
   trigger the execution of a Sieve script, subject to the settings
   defined through Metadata.  The exception is that in order to avoid
   script loops, flag changes that are made as a result of a script that
   was itself invoked because of flag changes SHOULD NOT result in
   another script invocation.  In any case, implementations MUST take
   steps to avoid such loops.

   For flag-change events, the Sieve script will see the message flags
   as they are AFTER the changes.

2.3.  New Functions Defined by IMAP events in Sieve

Internet-Draft            IMAP events in Sieve                March 2012


2.3.1.  Interaction with Metadata

   Support for IMAP events in Sieve requires support for IMAP Metadata
   [RFC5464] as well, since the latter is used to associate scripts with
   IMAP mailboxes.

   When an applicable event occurs on an IMAP mailbox, if there is an
   IMAP metadata entry named "/IMAPSieve/Script" for the mailbox, that
   entry is used.  If there is not, but there is an IMAP metadata entry
   named "/IMAPSieve/Script" for the server, that entry is used
   (providing a way to define a global script for all mailboxes on a
   server).  If neither entry exists, then no script will be invoked.

   If an "/IMAPSieve/Script" metadata entry was selected above, the
   shared value of that metadata name (its "value.shared" attribute)
   MUST be the name of the Sieve script that will be invoked in response
   to the IMAP event.  Note that only the value.shared attribute is
   used; any value.priv attributes are ignored.

   This specifies the mechanism for "activating" a script for a given
   mailbox (or for all mailboxes), but does not specify a mechanism for
   creating, storing, or validating the script.  Implementations MUST
   support ManageSieve [RFC5804], and can use the PUTSCRIPT command to
   store the script without using the SETACTIVE command to activate it.
   In any case, the script name that is specified in the /IMAPSieve/
   Script metadata entry is in a form that depends upon how the server
   handles the storing of Sieve scripts.  Script names used here MUST
   match script names used by METADATA.

   Only one Sieve script may currently be defined per mailbox,
   eliminating the complexity and possible ambiguity involved with
   coordinating the results of multiple scripts.  Any sub-filtering is
   done in the Sieve script.  For example, if it's only necessary to
   deal with flag changes, but not with new messages appended or copied,
   the Sieve script will still be invoked for all events, and the script
   is responsible for checking the event type.

   The possibility is open for an extension to add support for multiple
   scripts -- for example, per-client scripts on a multi-client user's
   inbox, or per-user scripts on a mailbox that is shared among users.

   Because this metadata name is associated with the mailbox, there can
   (and it's expected that there will) be different scripts associated
   with events for different mailboxes.  Indeed, most mailboxes will
   probably invoke no script at all.

3.  Applicable Sieve Actions and Interactions

   Since some Sieve actions relate specifically to the delivery of mail,
   not all actions and extensions make sense when the messages are
   created by other means or when changes are made to data associated
   with existing messages.  This section describes how actions in the
   base Sieve specification, and those in extensions known at this
   writing, relate to this specification.

   In addition to what is specified here, interactions noted in the
   individual specifications apply, and must be considered.

3.1.  The Implicit Keep

   For all cases that fall under IMAP events in Sieve, the implicit keep
   means that the message is treated as it would have been if no Sieve
   script were run.  For APPEND, MULTIAPPEND and COPY, the message is
   stored into the target mailbox normally.  For flag changes, the
   message is left in the mailbox.  If actions have been taken that
   change the message, those changes are considered transient and MUST
   NOT be retained for any keep action (because IMAP messages are
   immutable).  No error is generated, but the original message, without
   the changes, is kept.

3.2.  The Keep Action

   The keep action is applicable in all cases that fall under IMAP
   events in Sieve.  Its behaviour is as described for implicit keep, in
   Section 3.1.

3.3.  The Fileinto Action

   If the Sieve implementation supports the fileinto action, that action
   is applicable in all cases that fall under IMAP events in Sieve.  If
   the Copy extension [RFC3894] is available and the :copy option is
   specified, the implicit keep is retained; otherwise, fileinto cancels
   the implicit keep, as specified in the base Sieve specification.

   For APPEND, MULTIAPPEND, and COPY, the message is stored into the
   fileinto mailbox IN ADDITION TO the original target mailbox.  For
   flag changes, the message is COPIED into the fileinto mailbox,
   without removing the original.

   If a keep action is NOT also in effect, the original message is then
   marked with the \Deleted flag (and a flag-change Sieve script is NOT
   invoked).  The implementation MAY then expunge the original message
   (WITHOUT expunging other messages in the mailbox), or it MAY choose
   to have expunges batched, or done by a user.  If the server does the

Internet-Draft            IMAP events in Sieve                March 2012


   expunge, the effect is as though a client had flagged the message and
   done a UID EXPUNGE (see [RFC4315]) on the affected message(s) only.
   Handling it this way allows clients to handle messages consistently,
   and avoids hidden changes that might invalidate their message caches.

3.4.  The Redirect Action

   The redirect action is applicable in all cases that fall under IMAP
   events in Sieve.  It causes the message to be sent, as specified in
   the base Sieve specification, to the designated address.  If the Copy
   extension [RFC3894] is available and the :copy option is specified,
   the implicit keep is retained; otherwise, redirect cancels the
   implicit keep, as specified in the base Sieve specification.

   It's possible that a message processed in this way does not have the
   information necessary to be redirected properly.  It might lack
   necessary header information, and there might not be appropriate
   information for the MAIL FROM command.  In such cases, the "redirect"
   action uses Message Submission [RFC4409], and it is up to the Sieve
   engine to supply the missing information.  The redirect address is,
   of course, used for the "RCPT TO", and the "MAIL FROM" SHOULD be set
   to the address of the owner of the mailbox.  The message submission
   server is allowed, according to the Message Submission protocol, to
   perform necessary fix-up to the message (see section 8 of RFC 4409).
   It can also reject the submission attempt, if the message is too ill-
   formed for submission.

   For APPEND, MULTIAPPEND, and COPY, the message is stored into the
   target mailbox in addition to being redirected.  For flag changes,
   the message remains in its original mailbox.

   If a keep action is NOT also in effect, the original message is then
   marked with the \Deleted flag (and a flag-change Sieve script is NOT
   invoked).  The implementation MAY then expunge the original message
   (WITHOUT expunging other messages in the mailbox), or it MAY choose
   to have expunges batched, or done by a user.  If the server does the
   expunge, the effect is as though a client had flagged the message and
   done a UID EXPUNGE (see [RFC4315]) on the affected message(s) only.
   Handling it this way allows clients to handle messages consistently,
   and avoids hidden changes that might invalidate their message caches.

3.5.  The Discard Action

   The discard action is applicable in all cases that fall under IMAP
   events in Sieve.  For APPEND, MULTIAPPEND, and COPY, the message is
   first stored into the target mailbox.  If an explicit keep action is
   also in effect, the discard action now does nothing.  Otherwise, the
   original message is then marked with the \Deleted flag (and a flag-

   change Sieve script is NOT invoked).  The implementation MAY then
   expunge the original message (WITHOUT expunging other messages in the
   mailbox), or it MAY choose to have expunges batched, or done by a
   user.  If the server does the expunge, the effect is as though a
   client had flagged the message and done a UID EXPUNGE (see [RFC4315])
   on the affected message(s) only.  Handling it this way allows clients
   to handle messages consistently, and avoids hidden changes that might
   invalidate their message caches.

3.6.  The Notify Action

   If the Nofity extension [RFC5435] is available, the notify action is
   applicable in all cases that fall under IMAP events in Sieve.  The
   result is that the requested notification is sent, and that the
   message is otherwise handled as it would normally have been.

3.7.  The Addheader and Deleteheader Actions

   If the EditHeader extension [RFC5293] is available, it can be used to
   make transient changes to header fields, which aren't saved in place,
   such as for "redirect" or "fileinto" actions.  Because messages in
   IMAP mailboxes are immutable, such changes are NOT applicable for the
   "keep" acton (explicit or implicit).  See Section 3.1.

3.8.  The Setflag, Deleteflag, and Removeflag Actions

   Implementations of IMAP events in Sieve MUST also support the
   IMAP4Flags extension [RFC5232], and the actions associated with it
   are all applicable to any case that falls under IMAP events in Sieve.

   It is worth noting also that the "hasflag" test that is defined in
   the IMAP4Flags extension might be particularly useful in scripts
   triggered by flag changes ("hasflag" will see the new, changed
   flags).  The flag changes behave as though a client had made the
   change.

   As explained above, in order to avoid script loops flag changes that
   are made as a result of a script that was itself invoked because of
   flag changes SHOULD NOT result in another script invocation.  In any
   case, implementations MUST take steps to avoid such loops.

3.9.  MIME Part Tests and Replacement

   If the MIME Part Tests extension [RFC5703] is available, all of its
   functions can be used, but any changes made to the message, using the
   "replace" or "enclose" action, MUST be considered transient, and are
   only applicable with actions such as "redirect" and "fileinto".
   Because messages in IMAP mailboxes are immutable, such changes are

   NOT applicable for the "keep" acton (explicit or implicit).  See
   Section 3.1.

3.10.  Spamtest and Virustest

   If the Spamtest and Virustest extensions [RFC5235] are available,
   they are applicable in all cases that fall under IMAP events in
   Sieve.

3.11.  Inapplicable Actions

   The following actions and extensions are NOT applicable to any case
   that falls under IMAP events in Sieve, because they are specifically
   designed to respond to delivery of a new email message.  Their
   appearance in the "require" control or their use in an IMAP event
   MUST result in an error condition that will terminate the Sieve
   script:

      reject [RFC5228]

      ereject [RFC5429]

      vacation [RFC5230]

   Future extensions that are specifically designed to respond to
   delivery of a new email message will likewise not be applicable to
   this extension.

4.  Interaction With Sieve Environment

4.1.  Base Sieve Environment Items: location and phase

   The Sieve Environment extension defines a set of standard environment
   items (see [RFC5183], Section 4.1).  Two of those items are affected
   when the script is invoked through an IMAP event.

   The value of "location" is set to "MS" -- evaluation is being
   performed by a Message Store.

   The value of "phase" is set to "post" -- processing is taking place
   after (or perhaps instead of, in the case of APPEND) final delivery.

4.2.  New Sieve Environment Items: imapuser and imapemail

   In the normal case, when Sieve is used in final delivery, there is no
   identity for the "filer" -- the user who is creating or changing the
   message.  In this case, there is such an identity, and a Sieve script
   might want to access that identity.

   Implementations MUST set and make available two new environment
   items:

   "imapuser" -- the identity (login ID) of the IMAP user that caused
   the action.  This MUST be the empty string if it is accessed during
   normal (final delivery) Sieve processing.

   "imapemail" -- the primary email address of the IMAP user that caused
   the action (the user identified by "imapuser").  In some
   implementations, "imapuser" and "imapemail" might have the same
   value.  This MUST be the empty string if it is accessed during normal
   (final delivery) Sieve processing.

4.3.  New Sieve Environment Item: cause

   Each mailbox uses a single script for all the change conditions
   described in this document (append, copy, flag changes).  To support
   that, the implementation MUST set the Environment [RFC5183] item
   "cause", which contains the name of the action that caused the script
   to be invoked.  Its value is one of the following:

   o  APPEND (for invocations resulting from APPEND or MULTIAPPEND)

   o  COPY (for invocations resulting from COPY)

   o  FLAG (for invocations resulting from flag changes)

Internet-Draft            IMAP events in Sieve                March 2012


   Future extensions might define new events and, thus, new causes.
   Such extensions will come with their own capability strings, and the
   events they define will only be presented when their capabilities are
   requested.  Scripts that do not request those capabilities will not
   see those events, and will not encounter the new cause strings.

4.4.  New Sieve Environment Item: mailbox

   The implementation MUST set the Environment [RFC5183] item "mailbox"
   to the name of the mailbox that the affected message is in, in the
   case of existing messages, or is targeted to be stored into, in the
   case of new messages.  The value of this item is fixed when the
   script begins, and, in particular, MUST NOT change as a result of any
   action, such as "fileinto".

4.5.  New Sieve Environment Item: changedflags

   If the IMAP4Flags extension [RFC5232] is available, AND the script
   was invoked because of flag changes to an existing message, the
   implementation MUST set the Environment [RFC5183] item "changedflags"
   to the name(s) of the flag(s) that have changed.  If the script was
   not invoked because of flag changes, the value of this item MUST be
   the empty string.  The script will not know from this item whether
   the flags have been set or reset, but it can use the "hasflag" test
   to determine the current value.  See example 2 in Section 5 for an
   example of how this might be used.

4.6.  Interaction With Sieve Tests (Comparisons)

   Any tests against message envelope information, including the
   "envelope" test in the Sieve base specification, as well as any such
   test defined in extensions, are either inapplicable or have serious
   interoperability issues when performed at other than final-delivery
   time.  Therefore, envelope tests MUST NOT be permitted in the cases
   described here, and their use MUST generate a runtime error.

   This extension does not affect the operation of other tests or
   comparisons in the Sieve base specification.

5.  Examples

   Example 1:
   If a new message is added to the "ActionItems" mailbox, a copy is
   sent to the address "actionitems@example.com".

     require ["copy", "environment", "imapsieve"];

     if anyof (environment :is "cause" "APPEND",
               environment :is "cause" "COPY")  {
         if environment :is "mailbox" "ActionItems" {
             redirect :copy "actionitems@example.com";
         }
     }

   Example 2:
   If the script is called for any message with the \Flagged flag set
   (tested through the IMAP4Flags extension [RFC5232]), a notification
   is sent using the Notify extension [RFC5435].  No notification will
   be sent, though, if we're called with an existing message that
   already had that flag set.

     require ["enotify", "imap4flags", "variables",
              "environment", "imapsieve"];

     if environment :matches "mailbox" "*" {
         set "mailbox" "${1}";
     }

     if allof (hasflag "\\Flagged",
               not environment :contains "changedflags" "\\Flagged") {
       notify :message "Important message in ${mailbox}"
           "xmpp:tim@example.com?message;subject=SIEVE";
     }

6.  Security Considerations

   It is possible to introduce script processing loops by having a Sieve
   script that is triggered by flag changes use the actions defined in
   the IMAP4Flags extension [RFC5232].  Implementations MUST take steps
   to prevent such loops.  One way to avoid this problem is that if a
   script is invoked by flag changes, and that script further changes
   the flags, those flag changes SHOULD NOT trigger a Sieve script
   invocation.

   It is also possible to introduce loops through the "redirect" or
   "notify" actions.  See section 10 of Sieve [RFC5228], section 8 of
   Sieve Notify [RFC5435], and the Security Considerations sections of
   the applicable notification-method documents for loop-prevention
   information.  This extension does not change any of that advice.

   Other security considerations are discussed in IMAP [RFC3501], and
   Sieve [RFC5228], as well as in some of the other extension documents.
