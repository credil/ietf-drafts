         TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links):
                  Edge Directory Assistance Framework
             <draft-ietf-trill-directory-framework-05.txt>



Abstract

   Edge TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) switches
   currently learn the mapping between MAC addresses and their egress
   TRILL switch by observing the data packets they ingress or egress or
   by the TRILL ESADI (End Station Address Distribution Information)
   protocol. When an ingress TRILL switch receives a data frame whose
   destination address (MAC&VLAN) that switch does not know, the data
   frame is flooded within the frame's VLAN across the TRILL campus.

   This document describes the framework for using directory services to
   assist edge RBridges in reducing multi-destination frames,
   particularly unknown unicast frames flooding, and ARP/ND, thus
   improving TRILL network scalability.

INTERNET-DRAFT                         TRILL: Directory Assist Framework


1. Introduction

   Edge TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) switches
   (devices implementing [RFC6325], also known as RBridges) currently
   learn the mapping between destination MAC addresses and their egress
   TRILL switch by observing data packets or by the ESADI (End Station
   Address Distribution Information) protocol. When an ingress RBridge
   receives a data frame for a destination address (MAC&VLAN) that
   RBridge does not know, the data frame is flooded within that VLAN
   across the TRILL campus.

   This document describes a framework for using directory services to
   assist edge RBridges by reducing multi-destination frames,
   particularly ARP [RFC826], ND [RFC4861], and unknown unicast. This
   improves TRILL network scalability in environments where a directory
   can be available, such as data centers.

   Data center networks differ from enterprise campus networks in
   several ways that make them attractive for the use of directory
   assistance, in particular:

   1. Data centers, especially Internet and/or multi-tenant data centers
      tend to have a large number of end stations with a wide variety of
      applications.
   2. Data center topology is often based on racks and rows.
      Furthermore, guest operating system assignment to Servers, Racks,
      and Rows is orchestrated by a Server/VM (virtual machine)
      Management system, not done at random. So the information
      necessary for a directory is normally available from that
      management system.
   3. Rapid workload shifting in data centers can accelerate the
      frequency of the physical servers being re-loaded with different
      applications. Sometimes, the applications loaded into one physical
      server at different times can belong to different subnets. When a
      VM is moved to a new location or a server is loaded with a new
      application with different IP/MAC addresses, it is more likely
      that the destination address of data packets sent out from those
      VMs are unknown to their attached edge RBridges.
   4. With server virtualization, there is an increasing trend to
      dynamically create or delete VMs when demand for resource changes,
      to move VMs from overloaded servers to less loaded servers, or to
      aggregate VMs onto fewer servers when demand is light. This
      results in the more common occurrence of multiple subnets on the
      same port at the same time and a higher change rate for VMs than
      for physical servers.

   Both items 3 and 4 above can lead to applications in one subnet being
   placed in different locations (racks or rows) or one rack having
   applications belonging to different subnets.

   The terms "Subnet" and "VLAN" are used interchangeably in this
   document because it is common to map one subnet to one VLAN.

   Bridge:  IEEE Std 802.1Q-2011 compliant device [802.1Q]. In this
            document, Bridge is used interchangeably with Layer 2

            [IS-IS] [RFC6326].

   RBridge: "Routing Bridge", an alternative name for a TRILL switch.

   Station: A node, or a virtual node, with IP and/or MAC addresses.

3. Impact of Massive Number of End Stations

   This section discusses the impact of a massive number of end stations
   in a TRILL campus using Data Centers as an example.



3.1 Issues of Flooding Based Learning in Data Centers

   It is common for Data Center networks to have multiple tiers of
   switches, for example, one or two Access Switches for each server
   rack (ToR), aggregation switches for some rows (or EoR switches), and
   some core switches to interconnect the aggregation switches.  Many
   aggregation switches deployed in data centers have high port density.
   It is not uncommon to see aggregation switches interconnecting
   hundreds of ToR switches.

               Figure 1: Typical Data Center Network Design

   The following problems could occur when TRILL is deployed in a data
   center with large number of end stations and the end stations in one
   subnet/VLAN could be placed under multiple edge RBridges:

       - Unnecessary filling of slots in the MAC address learning table
         of edge RBridges, e.g. RBridge T11, due to T11 receiving
         broadcast / multicast traffic (e.g. ARP/ND, cluster multicast,
         etc.)  from end stations under other edge RBridges that are not
         actually communicating with any end stations attached to T11.

       - Packets being flooded across TRILL campus when their
         destination MAC addresses are not in ingress RBridge's MAC
         address to egress RBridge cache.


L. Dunbar, et al                                                [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT                         TRILL: Directory Assist Framework


       - In an environment where VMs migrate, there is a higher chance
         of cached information becoming invalid, causing traffic to be
         black-holed by the ingress RBridge, that is, persistently sent
         to the wrong egress RBridge. If VMs do not flood gratuitous
         ARP/ND or VDP [802.1Qbg] messages upon arriving at new
         locations, the ingress nodes might not have MAC entries for the
         MAC of the newly arrived VMs, causing unknown address flooding.



3.2 Two Examples

   Consider a data center with 1,600 server racks. Each server rack has
   at least one ToR switch. The ToR switches are further divided into 8
   groups, with each group being connected by a set of aggregation
   switches.  There could be 4 to 8 aggregation switches in each set to
   achieve load sharing for traffic to/from server racks. If TRILL is
   deployed in this data center environment, let's consider the
   following two scenarios for the TRILL campus boundary:

       - Scenario #1: TRILL campus boundary starts at ToR switches:

         If each server rack has one ToR, there are 1,600 edge RBridges.
         If each rack has two ToR switches, then there will be 3,200
         edge RBridges

         In this scenario, the TRILL domain will have more than 1,600
         (or 3,200) + 8*4 (or 8*8) nodes, which is a large IS-IS domain.
         Even though a mesh IS-IS domain can scale up to thousands of
         nodes, it is challenging for aggregation switches to handle IS-
         IS link state advertisement among hundreds of parallel ports.

       - Scenario #2: TRILL campus boundary starts at the aggregation
         switches:

         With the same assumptions as before, the number of nodes in the
         TRILL campus will be less than 100, and aggregation switches
         don't have to handle IS-IS link state advisements among
         hundreds of parallel ports.

         However, the number of MAC&VLAN <-> Egress RBridge Mapping
         entries to be learned and managed by RBridge edge node can be
         very large. In the example above, each edge RBridge has 200
         edge ports facing the ToR switches. If each ToR has 40
         downstream ports facing servers and each server has 10 VMs,
         there could be 200*40*10 = 80,000 end stations attached. If all
         those end stations belong to 1,600 VLANs (i.e. 50 per VLAN) and
         each VLAN has 200 end stations, then under the worst-case
         scenario, the total number of MAC&VLAN entries to be learned by
         the edge RBridge can be 1,600*200=320,000, which is very large.

4. Benefits of Directory Assisted Edge RBridge

   In some environments, particularly data centers, the assignment of
   applications to servers, including rack and row selection, is
   orchestrated by Server (or VM) Management System(s). That is, there
   is a database or multiple databases (distributed model) that have the
   knowledge of where each application is placed. If the application
   location information can be fed to RBridge edge nodes, through some
   form of Directory Service, then there is much less chance of RBridge
   edge nodes receiving unknown MAC destination address, therefore less
   chance of flooding.

   Avoiding unknown unicast address flooding to the TRILL campus is
   especially valuable in the data center environment because there is a
   higher chance of an edge RBridge receiving packets with unknown
   unicast destination address and broadcast / multicast messages due to
   VM migration and servers being loaded with different applications.
   When a VM is moved to a new location or a server is loaded with a new
   application with a different IP/MAC addresses, it is more likely that
   the destination address of data packets sent out from those VMs are
   unknown to their attached edge RBridges.  In addition, gratuitous ARP
   (IPv4, [RFC826]) or Unsolicited Neighbor Advertisement (IPv6,
   [RFC4861]) sent out from those newly migrated or activated VMs have
   to be flooded to other edge RBridges that have VMs in the same
   subnets.

   The benefits of using directory assistance include:

       - Avoid flooding unknown unicast destination address across the
         TRILL campus. The Directory enforced MAC&VLAN <-> Egress
         RBridge mapping table can determine if a data packet needs to
         be forwarded across TRILL campus.

         When multiple RBridge edge ports are connected, possibly via
         bridged LANs, to end stations (servers/VMs), a directory
         assisted edge RBridge won't need to flood unknown unicast
         destination data frames to all ports of the edge RBridges in
         the frame's VLAN when it ingresses a frame. It can depend on
         the directory to tell it where the destination is. When the
         directory doesn't have the needed information, the frames can
         be dropped or flooded depending on the policy configured.

       - Reduce flooding of decapsulated Ethernet frames with unknown
         MAC destination address to a bridged LAN connected to RBridge
         edge ports.

         When an RBridge receives a unicast TRILL data packet whose
         destination Nickname matches with its own, the normal procedure
         is for the RBridge to decapsulate it and forward the
         decapsulated Ethernet frame to the directly attached bridged


L. Dunbar, et al                                                [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT                         TRILL: Directory Assist Framework


         LAN. If the destination MAC is unknown, the RBridge floods the
         decapsulated Ethernet frame out all ports in the fame's VLAN.
         With directory assistance, the egress RBridge can determine if
         the MAC destination address in a frame matches any end stations
         attached via the bridged LAN. Frames can be discarded if their
         destination addresses do not match.

       - Reduce the amount of MAC&VLAN <-> Egress RBridge mapping
         maintained by edge RBridges. There is no need for an edge
         RBridge to keep MAC entries of remote end stations that don't
         communicate with the end stations locally attached.

       - Eliminate ARP/ND being broadcast or multicast through the TRILL
         core.

5. Generic operation of Directory Assistance

   There are two different models for Directory assistance to edge
   RBridges: Push Model and Pull Model.  The Directory Information is
   described in Section 5.1 below while Section 5.2 discusses Push Model
   requirements and Section 5.3 Pull Model requirements.



5.1 Information in Directory for Edge RBridges

   To achieve the benefits of directory assistance for TRILL, the
   corresponding directory server entries will need, at a minimum, the
   following logical data structure:

   [{IP, MAC/VLAN, {list of attached RBridge nicknames}, {list of
   interested RBridges}]

   The {list of attached RBridges} are the edge RBridges to which the
   host (or VM) specified by the [IP or MAC/VLAN] in the entry is
   attached. The {list of interested RBridges} are the remote RBridges
   that might have attached hosts that communicate with the host in this
   entry.

   When a host has multiple IP addresses, there will be multiple
   entries.

   The {list of interested RBridges} could get populated when an RBridge
   queries for information, or information is pushed from a directory
   server.  The list is used to notify those RBridges when the host
   (specified by the IP/MAC/VLAN) in the entry changes its RBridge
   attachment. An explicit list in the directory is not needed as long
   as the interested RBridges can be determined.



5.2 Push Model and Requirements

   Under this model, Directory Server(s) push the MAC&VLAN <-> Egress
   RBridge mapping for all the end stations that might communicate with
   end stations attached to an RBridge edge node.  If the packet's
   destination address can't be found in the MAC&VLAN <-> Egress RBridge
   table, the Ingress RBridge could be configured to:

       simply drop a data packet,

       flood it to the TRILL campus, or

       start the pull process to get information from pull directory
          server(s)


L. Dunbar, et al                                               [Page 10]

INTERNET-DRAFT                         TRILL: Directory Assist Framework


   It may not be necessary that every edge RBridge gets the entire
   mapping table for all the end stations in a campus. There are many
   ways to narrow the full set down to a smaller set of remote end
   stations that communicate with end stations attached to an edge
   RBridge. A simple approach is to only push the mapping for the VLANs
   that have active end stations under an edge RBridge. This approach
   can reduce the number of mapping entries being pushed.

   However, the Push Model usually will push more entries of MAC&VLAN
   <-> Egress RBridge mapping to an edge RBridges than needed.  Under
   the normal process of edge RBridge cache aging and unknown
   destination address flooding, rarely used mapping entries would have
   been removed.  But it can be difficult for Directory Servers to
   predict the communication patterns among applications within one
   VLAN.  Therefore, it is likely that the Directory Servers will push
   down all the MAC&VLAN entries if there are end stations in the VLAN
   attached to the edge RBridge. This is a disadvantage of the Push
   Model compared with the Pull Model described below.

   In the Push Model, it is necessary to have a way for an RBridge node
   to request directory server(s) to push the mapping entries.  This
   method should at least include the VLANs enabled on the RBridge, so
   that directory server doesn't need to push down the entire set of
   mapping entries for all the end stations in the campus. An RBridge
   must be able to get mapping entries when it is initialized or
   restarted.

   The Push Model's detailed method and any handshake mechanism between
   RBridge and Directory Server(s) is beyond the scope of this framework
   document.

   When a directory server needs to push a large number of entries to
   edge RBridges, efficient data organization should be considered. For
   example, with one edge RBridge Nickname being associated with all
   attached end stations' MAC addresses and VLANs as shown below:

   Whenever there is any change in MAC&VLAN <-> Egress RBridge mapping,
   that can be triggered by end stations being added, moved, or de-
   commissioned, an incremental update can be sent to the edge RBridges
   which are impacted by the change. Therefore, something like a
   sequence number has to be maintained by directory servers and
   RBridges. Detailed mechanisms will be specified in a separate
   document.



5.3 Pull Model and Requirements

   Under this model, an RBridge pulls the MAC&VLAN <-> Egress RBridge
   mapping entry from the directory server when its cache doesn't have
   the entry. There are a couple of possibilities for triggering the
   pulling process:

      - The RBridge edge node can send a pull request whenever it
        receives an unknown MAC destination, or

      - The RBridge edge node can intercept all ARP/ND requests and
        forward them or appropriate requests to the Directory Server(s)
        that has the information on where the target stations are
        located.

   The Pull Directory response could indicate that the address being
   queried is unknown or that the requestor is administratively
   prohibited from getting an informative response.

   By using a Pull Directory, a frame with unknown MAC destination
   address doesn't have to be flooded across the TRILL domain and the

   ARP/ND requests don't have to be broadcast or multicast across the
   TRILL domain.

   The ingress RBridge can cache the response pulled from the directory.
   The timer for such a cache should be short in an environment where
   VMs move frequently. The cache timer could be configured by the
   management system or could be sent along with the Pulled reply by the
   directory server(s). It is important that the cached information be
   kept consistant with the actual placement of addresses in the campus;
   therefore, there needs to be some mechanism by which RBridges that
   have pulled information that has not expired can be informed when
   that information changes or the like.

   One advantage of the Pull Model is that edge RBridges can age out
   MAC&VLAN entries if they haven't been used for a certain configured
   period of time or a period of time provided by the Directory.
   Therefore, each edge RBridge will only keep the entries that are
   frequently used, so its mapping table size will be smaller.  Edge
   RBridges would query the Directory Server(s) for unknown MAC
   destination addresses in data frames or ARP/ND and cache the
   response.  When end stations attached to remote edge RBridges rarely
   communicate with the locally attached end stations, the corresponding
   MAC&VLAN entries would be aged out from the RBridge's cache.

   An RBridge waiting for a response from Directory Servers upon
   receiving a data frame with an unknown destination address is similar
   to an L3/L2 boundary router waiting for an ARP or ND response upon
   receiving an IP data packet whose destination IP is not in the
   router's IP/MAC cache table.  Most deployed routers today do hold the
   packet and send ARP/ND requests to the target upon receiving a packet
   with destination IP not in its IP to MAC cache. When ARP/ND replies
   are received, the router will send the data packet to the target.
   This practice minimizes flooding when targets don't exist in the
   subnet.

   When the target doesn't exist in the subnet, routers generally re-
   send an ARP/ND request a few more times before dropping the packets.
   So, the holding time by routers to wait for an ARP/ND response, if
   the target doesn't exist in the subnet, can be longer than the time
   taken by the Pull Model to get IP to MAC mapping from a directory
   server.

   For RBridges with mapping entries being pushed from a directory
   server, they can be configured to use the Pull Model for targets
   which don't exist in the mapping data pushed.

   A separate document will specify the detailed messages and mechanism
   for RBridges to pull information from directory server(s).

INTERNET-DRAFT                         TRILL: Directory Assist Framework


6. Recommendation

   TRILL should provide a directory assisted approach.  This document
   describes a basic framework for directory assistance to RBridge edge
   nodes. More detailed mechanisms will be described in a separate
   document or documents.



7. Security Considerations

   Accurate mapping of IP addresses into MAC addresses and of MAC
   addresses to the RBridge from which they are reachable is important
   to the correct delivery of information. The security of specific
   directory assisted mechanisms will be discussed in the document or
   documents specifying those mechanisms.

   For general TRILL security considerations, see [RFC6325].



8. IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions. RFC Editor: please delete
   this section before publication.
