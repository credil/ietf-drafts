Abstract

   The Internet provides the ability for information to be spread beyond
   geographical boundaries at the speed of light.  Once information is
   available over the Internet it leaves the private realm.  If the
   information can be used to identify a person it can affect the
   privacy of the individual.  There are cases when it can increase the
   physical risk to the individual or where it can have a negative
   financial impact.  Some types of information can be an embarassment
   to an individual and negatively affect the person's reputation.

   This document discusses about whether Internet Identifiers and
   Session Identifiers can be information about an individual and
   whether consent is necessary.

1.  Background

   In 1881 French law about the freedom of the press [Leg1] offered
   protection for facts about an individual's private life by giving the
   individual the ability to seek redress by legal means if these facts
   were published by the press.  In an article published in the Harvard
   Law Review in 1890 [Leg2] it was mentioned that recent inventions and
   business methods call attention to the next step which must be taken
   for the protection of the person, and for securing to the individual
   what Judge Cooley calls the right "to be let alone".  The article
   cites the following text from E. L. Godkin about the rights of the
   citizen to his reputation:

      But as long as gossip was oral, it spread, as regards any one
      individual, over a very small area, and was confined to be
      immediate circle of his acquaintances.  It did not reach, or but
      rarely reached, those who knew nothing of him.  It did not make
      his name, or his walk, or his conversation familiar to strangers.

   In 1948 the United Declaration of Human Rights [Leg3] stated that "No
   one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy,
   family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and
   reputation.  Everyone has the right to the protection of the law
   against such interference or attacks".  Nowadays, privacy is
   sometimes equated with the "right to be left alone".

1.1.  Introduction

   The Internet provides the ability for information to be spread beyond
   geographical boundaries at the speed of light.  Once information is
   available over the Internet it leaves the private realm.  Although
   there is the ability to seek redress by legal means if information
   about an individual's private life is being distributed publicly over
   the Internet, it can be an impossible task when multiple juridictions
   are involved.  In essence, the information cannot be contained once
   it leaves the private realm.

   According to RFC 3365 [RFC3365] privacy refers to the right of an
   entity, normally a person, acting in its own behalf, to determine the
   degree to which it will interact with its environment, including the
   degree to which the entity is willing to share information about
   itself with others.

   If the information shared can be used to identify a person it can
   affect the privacy of the individual.  There are cases when it can
   increase the physical risk to the individual or where it can have a
   negative financial impact.  Some types of information can be an
   embarassment to an individual and negatively affect the person's

   reputation.

   This document discusses about whether Internet Identifiers and
   Session Identifiers can be information about an individual and
   whether consent is necessary.

1.2.  Note

   This Internet-Draft can be discussed on the ietf-privacy@ietf.org
   mailing list.  [RFC-Editor: please remove this paragraph]


2.  Personally Identifiable Information

   Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is a term generally used in
   discussions about privacy.  The U.S. National Institute of Standards
   and Technology defines PII [NIST] as any information about an
   individual including:

      any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an
      individual's identity, such as name, social security number, date
      and place of birth, mother's maiden name, or biometric records;
      and

      any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual,
      such as medical, educational, financial, and employment
      information.

   The European Union Directive 95/46/EC [EUD] defines "personal data"
   as follows:

      Personal data shall mean any information relating to an identified
      or identifiable natural person ("data subject"); an identifiable
      person is one who can be identified directly or indirectly, in
      particular by reference to an identification number or one or more
      factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic,
      cultural or social identity".


3.  Internet Identifiers

3.1.  IP address

   An Internet Identifier known as an IP address indicates where it is
   [RFC0791].

   In 2008, the European Union's Article 29 Data Protection Working
   Party [ARTDP] noted that Internet service providers should "treat all

Internet-Draft           Privacy and Identifiers             August 2012


   IP information as personal data" unless the Internet service
   providers can "distinguish with absolute certainty that the data
   correspond to users that cannot be identified".  In 2009, a U.S.
   District Court judge [USDC] ruled that:

      In order for "personally identifiable information" to be
      personally identifiable, it must identify a person.  But an IP
      address identifies a computer, and can do that only after matching
      the IP address to a list of a particular Internet service
      provider's subscribers.

3.2.  Email address

   An email address is a character string that identifies a user to whom
   mail will be sent or a location into which mail will be deposited
   [RFC5321].


4.  Session Identifiers

   A Session Identifier uniquely identifies a communication session.
   For example, a cookie [RFC6265] is session identifier used by HTTP
   servers to store state.  The HTTP server can send the user agent a
   cookie.  The user agent returns that cookie in subsequent requests.
   There are two types of cookies, session cookies and persistent
   cookies.  A session cookie is destroyed when the user agent is
   closed.  A persistent cookie is preserved across multiple sessions
   and is only destroyed once it reaches its expiration date.


5.  The right amount of information

   When a person explicitly addresses the remote end at the IP layer the
   person consents to the transmission of the IP address assigned to
   local end.  The IP addresses of the two end-hosts are necessary for
   IP-layer communication to be possible.  When a person sends an email
   the person consents to the transmission of an email address.  The
   email address is necessary for the recipient of the email to be able
   to reply to it.

   As a short-lived mechanism to store state it can be argued that a
   session identifier such as a session cookie is necessary to provide
   the functionality for a communication session.  There may be valid
   reasons for having a persistent cookie, for example, to store the
   preferences of the individual.  A persistent cookie can also be used
   to track a person's usage of a service.  If the intention of the
   person is not clear, he/she may have to be asked for consent.

   In an all-or-nothing proposition a person is faced with the
   inevitable choice of sharing information to be able to communicate.
   The interests and motivation of the two ends (e.g. the entity
   providing a service at one end and the person using the service at
   the other end) are not aligned.  It is difficult for the average
   person to take an informed decision about the amount of personally
   identifiable information that needs to be shared.  There is an
   implicit assumption that the underlying protocols are transmitting
   the right amount of information needed for the protocols to work.
   There is a reasonable expectation that the person will be provided
   with a cautionary notice to which he/she must consent to if the
   information being disclosed may adversely affect the person.


6.  Security Considerations

   It is a myth that people become anonymous when they are in a crowd.
   Naive users view the Internet as a place where they are anonymous and
   by extension, incorrectly assume they should not be concerned about
   their privacy.

   Privacy policies usually end up as disclaimers of liability instead
   of policies aimed at protecting privacy.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not request any action from IANA.
