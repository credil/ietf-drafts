Internet-Draft             RTP mapping to CLUE             February 2012


1.  Introduction

   Telepresence systems can send and receive multiple media streams.
   The CLUE framework [I-D.ietf-clue-framework] defines media captures
   as a source of Media, such as from one or more Capture Devices.  A
   Media Capture (MC) may be the source of one or more Media streams.  A
   Media Capture may also be constructed from other Media streams.  A
   middle box can express Media Captures that it constructs from Media
   streams it receives.

   SIP offer answer [RFC3264] uses SDP [RFC4566] to describe the
   RTP[RFC3550] media streams.  Each RTP stream has a payload type
   number and SSRC.  The content of the RTP stream is created by the
   encoder in the endpoint.  This may be an original content from a
   camera or a content created by an intermediary device like an MCU.

   The relation between the two descriptions is that the CLUE media
   capture defines some semantics describing the content of an RTP
   stream.

   This document discusses the relation between the CLUE media captures
   and the RTP streams and makes recommendations on how to co-relate
   between the two.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119[RFC2119] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant RTP implementations.


3.  Mapping CLUE Media Captures to RTP streams

   The SDP description of the RTP streams provides among others the
   inforamtion about the encoding and decdoing capbilities of the media
   as well as tranpsort addresses for receiving the RTP streams and some
   channels capbilities like the maximum bandwidth available for the
   data.

   The CLUE MCs provide semantic information of the stream which may be
   spatial inforamtion like left camera or on its content like loudest
   speaker

   An RTP stream can have different content based on the MC desription.
   For example one video capture from a camera may capture a third of
   the room while another from the same camera may provide a zoom

   version of the whole room.  These two media captures can be mapped to
   the same RTP stream.

   Using the video capture example from the framework document:

   o  VC0- (the camera-left camera stream, purpose=main, auto-
      switched:no

   o  VC1- (the center camera stream, purpose=main, auto-switched:no

   o  VC2- (the camera-right camera stream), purpose=main, auto-
      switched:no

   o  VC3- (the loudest panel stream), purpose=main, auto-switched:yes

   o  VC4- (the loudest panel stream with PiPs), purpose=main,
      composed=true; auto-switched:yes

   o  VC5- (the zoomed out view of all people in the room),
      purpose=main, composed=no; auto-switched:no

   o  VC6- (presentation stream), purpose=presentation, auto-switched:no

   Where the physical simultaneity information is:

      {VC0, VC1, VC2, VC3, VC4, VC6}

      {VC0, VC2, VC5, VC6}

   To describe the MCs need 6 RTP streams since the first simultenous
   entry defines 6 streams.  The RTP stream used for VC1 is also the RTP
   stream for VC5 coming from the same camera.  This mapping from a
   Media capture to an RTP stream is fixed.  The number of RTP streams
   depends on the maximum number of captures in one capture set entry
   from the capture set.

   This mapping can be done by defining a new [RFC5888] grouping
   attribute CaptureId and a new CLUE MC attribute RTP-id.

   The above exmaple will have the following SDP

         a=group:captureId 1 2 3 4 5 6

         m=video 49170 RTP/AVP 96

         a=rtpmap:96 H264/90000

         mid=1

         m=video 49172 RTP/AVP 96

         a=rtpmap:96 H264/90000

         mid=2

         m=video 49174 RTP/AVP 96

         a=rtpmap:96 H264/90000

         mid=3

         m=video 49176 RTP/AVP 96

         a=rtpmap:96 H264/90000

         mid=4

         m=video 49178 RTP/AVP 96

         a=rtpmap:96 H264/90000

         mid=5

         m=video 49180 RTP/AVP 96

         a=rtpmap:96 H264/90000

         mid=6

   There is a need for a new MC attribute RTPid which will have the mid
   of the related RTP stream

   o  VC0- (the camera-left camera stream, purpose=main, auto-
      switched:no, RTPid=1

   o  VC1- (the center camera stream, purpose=main, auto-switched:no,
      RTPid=2

   o  VC2- (the camera-right camera stream), purpose=main, auto-
      switched:no, RTPid=3

   o  VC3- (the loudest panel stream), purpose=main, auto-switched:yes,
      RTPid=4

   o  VC4- (the loudest panel stream with PiPs), purpose=main,
      composed=true; auto-switched:yes, RTPid=5

   o  VC5- (the zoomed out view of all people in the room),
      purpose=main, composed=no; auto-switched:no, RTPid=2

   o  VC6- (presentation stream), purpose=presentation, auto-
      switched:no, RTPid=6

   This will allow to provide different encdoing parameters to each MC
   and leverage other grouping defined like bundle.
