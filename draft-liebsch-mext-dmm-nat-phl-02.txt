         Per-Host Locators for Distributed Mobility Management
                 draft-liebsch-mext-dmm-nat-phl-02.txt

Abstract

   Mobile operators consider the distribution of mobility anchors to
   enable offloading some traffic from their core network.  In scope of
   a solution for Distributed Mobility Management is the maintenance of
   IP sessions and IP address continuity when mobile nodes get a new
   mobility anchor assigned during handover.  This document proposes the
   use of identifier-locator split concepts to achieve optimal routing
   of data packets to a mobile node's current mobility anchor.  The use
   of per-host locator IP addresses allows translation of addresses
   within the mobile operator network to route packets to the mobile
   node's current mobility anchor, while address translation is kept
   transparent to the communication endpoints.

1.  Introduction

   The concept of Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) in based on the
   distribution of mobility anchors towards the access networks to
   provide mobile nodes with local anchors and enable optimal routing of
   traffic above anchor level to any kind of serving point, e.g.
   distributed content caches.  The closer mobility anchors are located
   to mobile nodes, the more a mobile node's handover may necessitate
   the assignment of a new mobility anchor.  Continuity of a mobile
   node's IP address or IP address prefix enables IP session continuity,
   but creates the problem of routing downlink packets to the mobile
   node's current mobility anchor.  Different solutions and associated
   extensions to IP mobility management protocols are being considered
   to maintain a mobile node's IP session after mobility anchor
   relocation.

   The solution for DMM as described in this document adopts the concept
   of an identifier-locator split to solve the routing above anchor
   level and enable optimal routes to the mobile node's current mobility
   anchor.  Whereas the mobile node's Home Network Prefix (HNP) or Home
   Address is treated solely as identifier after mobility anchor
   relocation, the mobile node's current mobility anchor represents the
   locator.  The proposed solution assumes distributed DMM Ingress
   Routers (IR) which resolve the MN's identifier into a locator address
   in case they have to forward data traffic to a mobile node.  The
   mobile node's current mobility anchor serves as Egress Router (ER).
   Between the IR and ER, the existing routing or switching plane in the
   mobile operator network is in use.

   Instead of using encapsulation to tunnel packets between an IR and
   the ER, per-host locator addresses are used to network address
   translate (NAT) downlink packets at the IR(s) and route packets to
   the mobile node's anchor.  Locator addresses are overloaded to carry
   identifier information, which allows the ER to reverse address
   translate the packet's destination address into the mobile node's
   identifier (HNP or Home Address) as assigned by the initial mobility
   anchor.

   The proposed approach to solve DMM in the routing plane above
   mobility anchor level implies no dependency on the IP mobility
   protocol below anchors and requires no changes to the routing
   infrastructure, as standard routing and associated table entries can
   be used.  The introduced Ingress Router is represented by a regular
   router with the capability of performing pre-routing NAT to make use
   of a routable host address and to achieve that the data packet
   arrives at the mobile node's current mobility anchor using the most
   suitable route.

3.  Routing Plane Considerations of DMM

   The problem of routing downlink packets to the mobile node's current
   mobility anchor after anchor relocation is depicted in Figure 1.  The
   MN initially attaches to a Mobility Anchor (MA) and gets assigned an
   HNP from this MA's prefix pool in case Proxy Mobile IPv6 is used as
   mobility management protocol below MAs.  In case Mobile IPv6 is used,
   the initial MA assigns a Home Address to the MN.  In the following
   description, PMIPv6 is assumed, whereas the proposed solution for DMM
   is independent of the mobility management protocol.  The MN's initial
   anchor is denoted as previous MA (pMA), whereas the new anchor is
   denoted as new MA (nMA)

   The following symbolic notation of IP addresses is used: [Prefix]::
   [Suffix].

   The initial anchor pMA assigns the prefix A:1:: to the MN as a result
   of the MN's registration.  Routers in the mobile operator's core
   network forward all packets with prefix (PFX) A:x:: towards pMA.  As
   a result of handover, the MN gets a new mobility anchor (nMA)
   assigned.  In case nMA continues anchoring the MN's initially

   assigned IP address prefix, the DMM solution must enable forwarding
   of downlink packets to the nMA instead of following the default
   routing states, which forward all A:x:: prefixes to the pMA.
   Forwarding of packets from the pMA to the nMA may imply suboptimal
   routes from the CN.

   Figure 2 depicts the generic concept of using DMM Ingress Routers
   (IR) to resolve the MN's HNP into the associated locator address,
   which is represented by the MN's current MA (nMA).  Section 5
   comprises exemplary operations of IRs with a mapping system.
   However, detailed descriptions and recommendations of technology to
   resolve the locator is not covered in this version of the document.
   As the nMA serves as locator and ER, the IR can set up a forwarding
   tunnel to the ER.  The inner packet carries the MN's identifier,
   which allows forwarding of the packet after decapsulation of the
   tunnel at the ER according to the mobility management protocol
   supported by the nMA.

   Since the IR can be topologically far away from the nMA, the solution
   described in this document is based on address translation instead of
   using encapsulation between the IR and the ER to save encapsulation
   overhead.

4.  Use of NATs and per-host locators

   Translation of the MN's IP address into the locator address (pMA)
   implies loosing identifier information, which results in an issue at
   the ER to reverse address translate the MN's downlink packets into
   the associated identifier address (HNP, Home Address).  Hence, the
   proposed solution is based on per-host locators instead of referring
   to the nMA's IP address as locator.  Building the per-host locator is
   intrinsically supported by MAs for IP mobility management and are
   represented by the HNP or the Home Address respectively.

   At the nMA, the initially assigned address serves as identifier
   (HNP_id), whereas the nMA assigns a new HNP to the MN after
   registration, which is treated as per-host locator (HNP_loc).  The
   HNP_loc is not advertised to the MN for address configuration, but
   provided to a mapping system, which enables IRs to resolve the HNP_id
   into an HNP_loc.  The reference to a suitable mapping system is out
   of scope of the current version of this document.  A generic view of
   the operation between IRs and a mapping system is depicted in
   Section 5.  Figure 3 illustrates NATing the downlink packet's
   destination address at the IR into the HNP_loc.  According to local
   binding information, the nMA can reverse address translate the packet
   into the original IP address of the MN, which carries the HNP_id
   prefix.  Further forwarding from the nMA is performed according to
   the used mobility management protocol.

5.  Ascertaining of an MN's current anchor

   The routers, which function as DMM Ingress Router for an MN's data
   traffic, are able to perform pre-routing destination NAT on the
   traffic downlink path.  In case the router has no per-host state for
   the MN's IP address yet, the router can either forward the data
   packet according to a longest prefix match and update the route after
   the MN's IP address has been resolved into the currently valid
   locator, or the router holds the packet until a per-host state has
   been established after a query to a mapping system.  The proposed
   approach for DMM assumes the availability of a suitable mapping
   system, maintaining mappings between MNs' HNP_id and the HNP_loc,
   which is topologically anchored at the MN's current mobility anchor.
   Mapping entries are set up and maintained by registration with a
   mapping system.  Routers can query a mapping from the mapping system.
   Furthermore, the mapping system may maintain a list of routers, who
   queried a mapping for a particular MN.  This enables the mapping
   system to update these routers, which have a (soft) state for the MN
   to optimize routing of the MN's packets according to the HNP_loc,
   after the MN's HNP_id resolves into a new HNP_loc, e.g. after the MN
   has been assigned a new mobility anchor.  Since pushing unsolicited
   mapping updates to some routers exceeds the function of a mapping
   database, the following description denotes such mapping system as
   Mapping Control (MC) function.

5.1.  Resolving an MN's Locator State at a Router

   Figure 4 depicts an exemplary procedure of the registration of the
   MN's mapping between its HNP_id (A:1::) and the HNP_loc (B:1::) after
   anchor relocation.  The MN's previous mobility anchor (pMA) serves as
   initial anchor to the MN and has assigned the MN a prefix A:1:: from
   its available prefix pool (A:x::) (1).  After the MN has been changed
   to a new mobility anchor (nMA), the nMA assigns a per-host prefix to
   the MN (B:1::) from its available prefix pool (B:x::) (2), which is
   used as HNP_loc and registered with the mapping control (MC) (3).  As
   soon as a router (Rt1) has to forward packets towards the MN, it can
   query the MC about an HNP_loc while treating the destination IP
   address in the packet being sent by the traffic source (S) as HNP_id
   (4).  According to the response, the router (Rt) can perform
   destination NAT of the packet's HNP_id based destination IP address
   (A:1::1) to the HNP_loc based address (B:1::1) and forward the packet
   according to the translated address (6).  The MN's current mobility
   anchor performs reverse address translation of the HNP_loc based IP
   address to the original HNP_id based IP address (A:1::1).

   As an alternative, the router (Rt1) can forward the downlink packet
   towards the MN's initial mobility anchor according to its local
   routing table using a longest prefix match, as depicted in Figure 4.
   In parallel, the router (Rt1) can query the HNP_loc for the MN from
   the MC (4).  Such approach avoids holding the MN's downlink packet in
   a buffer while the MC is contacted.  However, the MN's initial anchor
   (pMA) must ensure that the data packet will be forwarded to the MN's
   current anchor, for example by holding a state about the MN's mapping
   (4).  The pMA can utilize the same NAT rules as the router (Rt1) and
   forward the packet to the MN's current anchor according to the
   address translated HNP_loc based IP address (5).  After a completed
   mapping query (6)(7), the router (Rt1) can perform address
   translation and route the packet according to its HNP_loc based IP
   address (8).  For any packet, which arrives at the current anchor
   (nMA) using the HNP_loc address, the nMA translates the packet's
   destination address back to the original HNP_id based IP address (9).

5.2.  Maintenance of an MN's Locator State at a Router

   After anchor relocation, the MN's current mobility anchor binds the
   MN's HNP_id based prefix (A:1::) as well the HNP_loc based prefix
   (B:1::) to the MN's registration (1), as depicted in Figure 6.  The
   MN has two active IP sessions from different sources (S), whose
   downlink packets are directed to the MN's current mobility anchor by
   different routers (Rt1)(Rt2), which function as DMM Ingress Routers.
   After the MN has been assigned a new mobility anchor (nMA), the MN
   receives an updated HNP_loc from the nMA's prefix pool (C:1::), which
   is then registered with the MC (3).  The MC updates the routers,
   which maintain a mapping (soft) state for the MN (4).  This results
   in a translation of the packets' downlink address into a locator,
   which is based on the HNP_loc assigned by the nMA (5).

6.  Function of the DMM Ingress Router

   The DMM Ingress Router (IR) is a regular IP router in the mobile
   operator's network, which can apply host rules to forward traffic to
   a MN's current mobility anchor.  The router must be able to receive
   and enforce mapping policies.  According to these mapping policies,
   the router can use the locator information to either tunnel the
   packet to the MN's current mobility anchor, or use destination NAT to
   allow routing the plain data packet to the MN's current mobility
   anchor while saving encapsulation overhead.

   Figure 7 depicts the key functional architecture of such a router,
   which is able to use network address translation before routing the
   MN's packet to the currently used mobility anchor by means of an
   HNP_loc based IP address.
