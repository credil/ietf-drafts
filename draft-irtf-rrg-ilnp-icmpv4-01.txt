   RG reached a consensus that the document still should be

Abstract

   This note defines an experimental ICMP message type for IPv4 used
   with the Identifier-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP).  The
   Identifier-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP) is an experimental,
   evolutionary enhancement to IP.  The ICMP message defined herein
   is used to dynamically update Identifier/Locator bindings for an
   existing ILNP session.  This is a product of the IRTF Routing RG.

1. INTRODUCTION

   The Identifier Locator Network Protocol (ILNP) is a proposal for
   evolving the Internet Architecture.  It differs from the current
   Internet Architecture primarily by deprecating the concept of an
   IP Address, and instead defining two new objects, each having
   crisp syntax and semantics.  The first new object is the Locator,
   a topology-dependent name for a subnetwork.  The other new object
   is the Identifier, which provides a topology-independent name for
   a node.

1.1  ILNP Document Roadmap

   The ILNP Architecture document [ILNP-ARCH] is the best place to
   start reading about ILNP.  ILNP has multiple instantiations.
   [ILNP-ENG] discusses engineering and implementation aspects
   common to all instances of ILNP.  [ILNP-v4OPTS] defines two new
   IPv4 options used with ILNPv4.  This document discusses a new
   ICMP for IPv4 message.  [ILNP-DNS] describes new Domain Name
   System (DNS) resource records used with ILNP.  Other documents
   describe ILNP for IPv6 (ILNPv6).

1.2  ICMPv4 Locator Update

   As described in [ILNP-ARCH] and [ILNP-ENG], an ILNP for IPv4
   (ILNPv4) node might need to inform correspondent ILNPv4 nodes of
   changes to the set of valid Locator values.  The new ICMPv4
   Locator Update message described in this document enables an
   ILNP-capable node to update its correspondents about the
   currently valid set of Locators valid to use in reaching the node
   sending this message [RFC2460] [RFC4443].

   This new ICMPv4 message MUST ONLY be used for ILNPv4 sessions.
   Authentication is always required, as described in the Security
   Considerations section later in this note.

   Some might consider any and all use of ICMP to be undesirable.
   In that context, please note that while this specification uses
   ICMP, on grounds that this is a control message, there is no
   architectural difference between using ICMP and using some
   different framing, for example UDP.


1.3  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described

2.  ICMP Locator Update message for ILNPv4

   The ICMP for IPv4 message described in this section has ICMP Type
   XXX and is used ONLY with a current ILNPv4 session.  This message
   enables an ILNPv4 node to inform ILNPv4 correspondent nodes of
   changes to the active Locator set for the ILNPv4 node that
   originates this message.  This particular ICMP for IPv4 message
   MUST ONLY be used with ILNPv4 communications sessions.

          i = 1..Num of Locs   valid for the sending ILNPv4 node.

         Preference[i],        The preferability of each Locator[i],
          i = 1..Num of Locs   relative to other valid Locator[i]
                               values. The Preference numbers here
                               are identical, both in syntax and
                               semantics, to the Preference values
                               for L32 records that are specified by
                               [ILNP-DNS].

                               to the DNS lifetime of the
                               corresponding L64 record, if one
                               exists.

          RESERVED             A field reserved for possible future
                               use.  At present, the sender MUST
                               initialise this field to zero.
                               Receivers should ignore this field at
                               present.  The field might be used for
                               some protocol function in future.


   All ILNPv4 ICMP Locator Update messages MUST contain a valid
   ILNPv4 Identifier option and MUST contain an ILNPv4 Nonce Option.

   ILNPv4 ICMP Locator Update messages also MAY be protected using
   IP Security for ILNP [ILNP-ENG] [RFC4301].  Deployments in
   high-threat environments SHOULD also protect ILNPv4 ICMP Locator
   Update messages using IP Security.  While IPsec ESP can protect a
   payload, no form of IPsec ESP is able to protect an IPv4 option
   that appears prior to the ESP header.  Note that even when IP
   Security for ILNP is in use, the ILNPv4 Nonce Option still MUST
   be present.  This simplifies protocol processing, and it also
   means that a receiver can perform the inexpensive check of the
   Nonce value before performing any (potentially expensive)
   cryptographic calculation.

3.  Transport Protocol Effects

   This message has no impact on any transport protocol.

   The message may affect where packets for a given transport
   session are sent, but an ILNP design objective is to decouple
   transport-protocols from network-layer changes.

Internet Draft     ILNPv4 ICMP        26 MAR 2012


4. Implementation Considerations

   Implementers may use any internal implementation they wish,
   provided that the external appearance is the same as this
   implementation approach.

   To support ILNPv4, and to retain the incremental deployability
   and backwards compatibility needed, the network layer needs a
   mode bit in the Transport Control Block (or its equivalent) to
   track which IP sessions are using the classic IPv4 mode and which
   IP sessions are using ILNPv4 mode.

   Further, when supporting ILNPv4, nodes will need to support a
   Identifier Locator Communication Cache (ILCC) in the network
   layer as described in [ILNP-ENG].

   A node sending an ICMP Locator Update message MUST include all
   currently valid Locator values in that message.  A node receiving
   a valid ICMP Locator Update message MUST replace the previously
   current set of Locator values for that correspondent node in its
   own ILCC with the newly received set of Locator values.

   Every implementation needs to support a large number of Locator
   values being sent or received in a single ICMP Locator Update
   message, because a multi-homed node or multi-homed site might
   have a large number of upstream links to different service
   providers, each with its own Locator value.


5.  Backwards Compatibility

   When ILNPv4 is not in use, the receiving IPv4 mode MUST discard
   the ICMP Locator Update packet without processing the packet.


6.  SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

   Security considerations for the overall ILNP Architecture
   are described in [ILNP-ARCH].  Additional common security
   considerations are described in [ILNP-ENG].  This section
   describes security considerations specific to ILNPv4 topics
   discussed in this document.

   The ICMPv4 Locator Update message MUST ONLY be used for ILNPv4
   sessions.

   The ILNPv4 Nonce Option [ILNP-v4OPTS] MUST be present in packets
   containing an ICMPv4 Locator Update message.  Further, the



Atkinson & Bhatti  Expires in 6 months                          [Page 6]

Internet Draft     ILNPv4 ICMP        26 MAR 2012


   received Nonce Destination Option must contain the correct nonce
   value for the packet to be accepted by the recipient and then
   passed to the ICMPv4 protocol for processing. If either of these
   requirements are not met, the received packet MUST be discarded
   as not authentic, and a security event SHOULD be logged by the
   system receiving the non-authentic packet.

   Sessions operating in higher risk environments SHOULD use IP
   Security for ILNP [ILNP-ENG] [RFC4301] *in addition* to the
   ILNPv4 Nonce Option.  Use of IP Security for ILNP to protect a
   packet does NOT permit the packet to be sent without the Nonce
   Option.

   Implementations need to support the case where a single ICMP
   Locator Update message contains a large number of Locator and
   Preference values and ought not develop a security fault
   (e.g. stack overflow) due to a received message containing more
   Locator values than expected.

   If the ILNP Nonce value is predictable, then an off-path attacker
   might be able to forge data or control packets.  This risk also
   is mitigated by the existing common practice of IP Source Address
   filtering [RFC2827] [RFC3704].

7.  IANA CONSIDERATIONS

   IANA is requested to assign a new ICMP Type number for this ICMP
   Locator Update message, replacing XXX above, following the
   procedures in [RFC2780].

   The ICMP Locator Update message does not use the ICMP Extension
   Structure defined in [RFC4884].  At present, the only ICMP Code
   valid for this ICMP Type is zero (0), which means "No Code".

RFC EDITOR NOTE

   This section is to be removed prior to publication.

   This document is written in English, not American.  So English
   spelling is used throughout, rather than American spelling.
   This is consistent with existing practice in several other RFCs,
   for example RFC-5887.

   This document tries to be very careful with history, in the
   interest of correctly crediting ideas to their earliest
   identifiable author(s).  So in several places the first published
   RFC about a topic is cited rather than the most recent published
   RFC about that topic.
