              Network Virtualization Overlay Architecture
                  draft-fw-nvo3-server2vcenter-01.txt

Abstract

   Multiple virtual machines (VMs) created in a single physical platform
   Or vServer greatly improve the efficiency of data centers by enabling
   more work from less hardware.  Multiple vServer and associated
   virtual machines work together as one cluster make good use of
   resources of each vServer that are scattered into different data
   centers or vServers.  VMs have their lifecycles from VM creation, VM
   Power on to VM Power off and VM deletion.  The VMs may also move
   across the participating virtualization hosts (e.g., the
   virtualization server, hypervisor).  This document discusses how VMs,
   vServers and overlay network are managed by leveraging control plane
   function and management plane function and desired signaling
   functionalities for Network Virtualization Overlay.

1.  Introduction

   Multiple virtual machines (VMs) created in a single physical platform
   greatly improve the efficiency of data centers by enabling more work
   from less hardware.  Multiple vServer and associated virtual machines
   work together as one cluster make good use of resources of each
   vServer that are scattered into different data centers or vServers.
   VMs have their lifecycles from VM creation, VM startup to VM poweroff
   and VM deletion.  The VMs may also move across the participating
   virtualization hosts (e.g., the virtualization server or hypervisor).
   One example is, as the workload on one physical server increases or
   physical server needs upgrade, VMs can be moved to other available
   lightweight-workload servers to ensure that service level agreement
   and response time requirements are met.  We call this VM movement or
   relocation as VM migration.  When the workload decreases, the VMs can
   be moved back, allowing the unused server powered off to save cost
   and energy.  Another example is as one tenant moves, VMs associated
   with this tenant may also move to the place that is more close to the
   tenant and provides better user experience (e.g., larger bandwidth
   with lower latency).  We call such movements as VM mobility.  VM
   migration refers to the transfer of a VM image including memory,
   storage and network connectivity while VM mobility refers to sending
   data to the moving tenant associated with the VM and emphasizes
   service non-disruption during a tenant's movement.  This document
   advocates the distinction between VM mobility and VM migration, both
   important notions in VM management.  The implication is that
   different signaling or protocols for VM mobility and VM migration
   might be chosen to automate Network Management for VM Movement, thus
   possibly reusing the existing protocols or schemes to manage VM
   migration and VM mobility separately.  Unfortunately we sometimes
   mixed them up or don't distinct VM migration management from VM
   mobility management and intend to utilize one common protocol to
   support both VM migration and VM mobility, which seems to simplify
   the overall protocol design but it is difficult or impossible to run
   one such protocol across both VM mobility management system that
   manages VM mobility and VM management platform that manages VM
   attributes.

   This document discusses how VMs,vServer and overlay network to which
   VMs are connecting are managed, signaling for VM, overlay network
   management and argues VMs need management or control functionality
   support but can be managed without VM mobility functionality support.

3.  Discussions

3.1.  VM awareness and VM movement awareness

   Virtual machines usually operate under the control of a server
   virtualization software residing on the physical compute server.  The
   server virtualization software is commonly referred to as
   'hypervisor'.  The hypervisor is the container of the VM and provides
   shared compute/memory/storage and network connectivity to each VM
   that it hosts.  Therefore the hypervisor or the virtualized server
   MUST be aware of VMs that it hosts.  However it should not be aware
   of VMs that it doesn't host.  When VMs hosted in different
   virtualization servers need to communicate each other, packets from
   one VM will be forwarded by a virtual switch within the
   virtualization server or the hypervisor to other VMs on another
   virtualization server.  Since the virtual switch resides within the
   hypervisor or virtualization server, the rule on VM awareness applied
   to the hypervisor should apply to virtual switch too.

   Unlike VM awareness, VM movement awareness is the capability of
   knowing the location update of the VM.  For example, when a VM moves
   out of the hypervisor and goes to another host, the original
   hypervisor that hosts the VM is aware of VM movement or location
   changing but may not be able to keep track of the new location after
   the VM moves.  Therefore one external party that maintains the
   mapping between the VM's identity and the VM's current location is
   needed which keeps track VM movements.

3.2.  Why VM migration

   VM migration refers to VM movement within a virtual environment in
   response to events, conditions or based on requirements.  The events
   or conditions could be, for example, very high workloads experienced
   by the VMs or upgrades of the physical server or virtualization
   server, load balancing between virtualization servers.  The
   requirements could be, for example, low power and low cost
   requirements or service continuity requirement.  When a VM is moved
   without service disruption, we usually call this VM movement as VM
   mobility.  However it is very difficult to provide transparent VM
   mobility support since it not only needs to keep connection
   uninterrupted but also needs to move the whole VM image from one
   place to another place, which may take a long down time (e.g., more
   than 400 ms) and can be noticed by the end user.

   Fortunately, VMs may be migrated without VM mobility support.  For
   example, a server manager or administrator can move a running virtual
   machine or application between different physical machines without
   disconnecting the client or application if the client or application



Schott & Wu              Expires August 22, 2013                [Page 6]

   supports VM suspending and resuming operation or stopped at the
   source before the movement and restart at the destination after
   movement.

   In some case when VM mobility is really needed, it is recommended
   that one copy of VM SHOULD be replicated from the source to the
   destination and during VM replication, thus the VM running on the
   source should not be affected.  When VM replication to the
   destination completes and the VM on the destination restarts, the VM
   on the source can be stopped.  However how the VM on the destination
   coordinates with the VM on the source to know whom the latter is
   communicating with is a challenging issue.

3.3.  Who manages VM

   To ensure the quality of applications (e.g., real-time applications)
   or provide the same service level agreement, the VM's state(i.e., the
   network attributes and policies associated with the VM ) should be
   moved with the VM as well when the VM moves across participating
   virtualization hosts (e.g., virtualization server or hypervisor).
   These network attributes associated with VM should be enforced on the
   physical switch and the virtual switch corresponding to VM to avoid
   security and access threats.  The hypervisor or the virtualization
   server may maintain the network attributes for each VM.  However when
   VMs are moved from the previous server to the new server, the old
   server and the new server may have no means to find each other.
   Therefore one external party called VM network management system
   (e.g., Cloud Broker) is needed and should get involved to coordinate
   between the old server and the new server to establish the
   association between network attributes/policies and the VM's
   identity.  If the VM management system does not span across data
   center and the VM is moved between data centers, the VM network
   management system in one data center may also need to coordinate with
   VM network management system in another data center.

3.4.  VM Grouping

   VM grouping significantly simplifies the administration tasks when
   managing large numbers of virtual machines, as new VMs are simply
   added to existing groups.  With grouping, similar VMs can be grouped
   together and assigned with the same networking policies to all
   members of the group to ensure consistent allocation of resources and
   security measures to meet service level goals.  Members of the group
   retain the group attributes wherever they are located or move within
   the virtual environment, providing a basis for dynamic policy
   assignments.  VM groups can be maintained or distributed on the
   virtualization server or can be maintained on a centralized place,
   e.g., the VM management platform that manages all the virtualization



Schott & Wu              Expires August 22, 2013                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              NVO3 Architecture              February 2013


   servers in the data center.  VM groups maintained on each
   virtualization server may change at any time due to various VM
   operations (e.g., VM adding, VM removing, VM moving).  Therefore VM
   groups need to be synchronized with the central VM management
   platform.  Profiles containing network configurations such as VLAN,
   traffic shaping and ACLs for VM groups can be automatically
   synchronized to the central VM management platform as well.  This
   way, consistent network policies can be enforced regardless of the
   VM's location.

3.5.  What VM information should be managed

   The ability to identify VMs within the physical hosts is very
   important.  With the ability to identify each VM uniquely, the
   administrator can apply the same philosophy to VMs as used with
   physical servers.  VLAN and QoS settings can be provisioned and ACL
   attributes can be set at a VM level with permit and deny actions
   based on layer 2 to layer 4 information.  In the VM environment, a VM
   is usually identified by MAC or IP address and belongs to one tenant.
   Typically, one tenant may possess of one VM or a group of VMs in one
   virtual network or several groups of VMs distributed in multiple
   virtual networks.  On the request of the tenant, a VM can be added,
   removed and moved by the virtualization server or the hypervisor.
   When the VM moves, the network attributes or configuration attributes
   associated with the VM should also be moved with the VM as well to
   ensure that the service level agreement and response times are met.
   These network attributes include access and tunnel policies and (L2
   and/or L3) forwarding functions and should be moved with the VM
   information.  We use Virtual Network Instance ID to represent those
   network attributes.  One tenant has at least one Virtual Network ID.
   Therefore each tenant should at least include the following
   information:

   o  vCenter Name or Identifier

   o  vServer Name or Identifier

   o  Virtual Network ID (VNID)

   o  VLAN tag value

   o  VM Group ID

   o  VM MAC/IP address

   Note that Tenant may have tenant ID which could be combination of
   these information.

3.6.  Who Triggers or Controls VM Movements

   VM can be moved within the virtual environment in response to events
   or conditions.  An issue here is who triggers and controls VM
   movement?  In a small scale or large scale data center, the server
   administrator is usually not aware of VM movement and may respond
   quickly to system fault or server overload and move a virtual machine
   or a group of VMs to different physical machines.  However it is hard
   for the server administrator to response to dynamic VM movement and
   creation since he doesn't keep track of VM movements.

   In large scale data centers, the server administrator may be more
   hesitated to utilize VM movements because of the time demands of
   managing the related networking requirements.  Therefore automated
   solutions that safely create and move virtual machines and free VM
   network or Server administrators from their responsibilities is
   highly required.

   The external party (i.e., the control or management plane function)
   is needed to play the role of server administrator and should support
   keeping track of VM movement and response quickly to dynamic VM
   creation and movement.

   When one tenant moves from one place to another place, VM movement
   associated tenant should be informed to the control or management
   plane function.  When one tenant requests to improve the quality of
   application and shorten the response time, the control or management
   function can trigger VM being moved to the server that is closer to
   the user.

3.7.  VM Monitoring

   In order to sort out bad VMs, VM monitoring is very important.  The
   VM monitor mechanism keeps track of the availability of VMs and their
   resource entitlements and utilization, e.g., CPU utilization, Disk
   and memory utilization, network utilization, network storage
   utilization,.  It ensures that there is no overloading of resources
   whereby many service requests cannot be simultaneously fulfilled due
   to limited resource available.  VM monitor is also useful for server
   administrations and report the status information of VMs or VM groups
   in each server to the VM management and provision system.

4.  Use Cases

4.1.  On Demand Network Provision Automation within the data center

   The Tenant Alice is logging into user portal via her laptop and
   request playing Cloud gaming using VM she has already rented, the
   request is redirected to the provision system vCenter, the vCenter
   retrieves service configuration information and locate which vServer
   the VM belongs to and then Provision resources for VM running on that
   vServer.  The vServer signals the VM operation parameter update to
   the NVE to which the VM is connecting.  In turn, the NVE device
   interacts with the DC nDirector to configure policy and populate the
   forwarding table to each network element (e.g., ToR,DC GW), in the
   path from the Tenant End System to the NVE Device.  In addition, the
   DC nDirector may also populate the mapping table to map the
   destination address (either L2 or L3) of a packet received from a VM
   into the corresponding destination address of the NVE device.

4.2.  Large inter-data centers Layer 2 interconnection and data
      forwarding

   When the tenant Alice using VM1 in data center1 communicates with
   tenant Bob using VM2 in data center2, the VM1 should already know
   layer2 identity of VM2, however the VM1 may not know which NVE Edge
   the VM2 is placed behind, in order to learn the location of the
   remote NVE Device associated VM2, the mapping table is needed on the
   local NVE Device associated with VM1 which is used to map the final
   destination(i.e.,the identity of VM2) to the destination address of
   the remote NVE device associated with VM2.  In order to realize this,
   the nDirector should tell the local NVE device associated with VM1
   about layer 3 location identifier of remote NVE device associated
   with VM2 and establish mapping between layer 2 VM2 identity and layer
   3 identity of the remote NVE Edge associated with VM2.  In addition,
   the nDirector may tell all the remote NVE devices associated with the
   VM which the VM1 is communicating with to establish the mapping
   between layer 2 VM1 identity and layer 3 identity of the local NVE
   Device associated with VM1.  When this is done, the data packet from
   VM1 can be sent to the NVE device associated with VM1, the NVE Device
   associated with VM1 can identify layer 2 frame targeted for remote
   destination based on established mapping table, encapsulates it into
   IP packet and transmit it across layer 3 network.  After the packet
   arrives at the remote NVE Edge, the remove NVE Edge device
   decapsulates layer 3 packet, take out layer 2 frame and forward it to
   ultimate destination VM2.

4.3.  Enable multiple data centers present as one

   In order to support more data centers interconnection and enable more
   efficient use of resources in each data center, multiple data centers
   may closely coordinate with each other to better load balancing
   capability and work as one large DC with the involvement of the
   nDirector that manages DCs, e.g., DC nDirector in each data center
   may coordinate with each other and form one common control plane.

4.4.  VM migration and mobility across data centers

   The Tenant Alice is using VM1 in data center 1 to communicate with
   the tenant Bob who is using VM9 in data center 2.  For business
   reason, the tenant Alice travels to the Bob's city where the data
   center 2 situates but still use VM1 in the data center 1 to
   communicate with the tenant Bob. In order to provide better user
   experience, the VM1 may be move from vServer 1 to the new vServer3 in
   the data center 2 which is more close to where the tenant Alice is
   located.  The vCenter can get involved to interact with data center 1
   and data center2 and help replicate and relocate VM1 to the new
   location.  In the meanwhile ,when VM movement is done, the NVE device
   connecting to VM1 and associated with vServer 3 should interact with
   the nDirector to update mapping table maintained in the nDirector by
   the new NVE device location associated with VM1.  In turn, the
   nDirector should update the mapping tables in all the NVE device
   associated with the VM which VM1 is communicating with.

5.  General Network Virtualization Architecture

   When Multiple virtual machines (VMs) created in one vServer,VM can be
   managed under this vServer.  However vServer can not be isolated node
   since VM can be moved from one to another vServer under the same or
   different data center which is beyond the control of the vServer who
   create that VM.  We envision the Network virtualization architecture
   to consist of vServers (virtualization servers),nDirector and
   vCenters (the aforementioned VM and vServer management platform) and
   NVE Edges.  The vCenter is placed on the management plane within each
   data center and can be used to manage a large number of vServers in
   each data center.  The vServer is connecting to NVE Edge in its own
   data center either directly or via a switched network (typically
   Ethernet).  The nDirector is placed on the control plane and manage
   one or multiple data centers.  When the nDirector manages multiple
   data centers, the nDirector should interact with all the NVE Edges in
   each data center to facilitate large inter-data center Layer 2
   interconnection, VM migration and mobility across data centers and
   enabling multiple data centers work and present as one.

                    Network Virtualization Architecture

5.1.  NVE (Network Virtualization Edge Function)

   As defined in section 1.2 of [I.D-ietf-nvo3-framework],it is a
   network entity that sits on the edge of the NVO3 network and could be
   implemented as part of a virtual switch within a hypervisor, a
   physical switch or router, a Network Service Appliance(e.g.,NAT/
   FW).When VM1 connecting to one NVE Edge want to communicate with the
   other VMs which are connecting to the other NVE Edges, the NVE Edge
   associated with VM1 should distribute the mapping between layer 2
   identity of VM1 and NVE Edge associated with VM1 by the nDirector to
   all the NVE Edges associated with VMs which VM1 is communicating

Internet-Draft              NVO3 Architecture              February 2013


   with.  In addition, the NVE Edge associated with VM1 either interact
   with the nDirector or learn from the other NVE Edges who is
   distributing mapping table through the nDirector to build mapping
   table between layer 2 identity of VMs which VM1 is communicating with
   the NVE Edge associated with VMs which VM1 is communicating with and
   based on such mapping table to forward the data packets.

5.2.  vServer (virtualization Server)

   The vServer is served as a platform for running virtual machines and
   is installed on the physical hardware in a virtualized environment
   and provide physical hardware resource dynamically to the virtual
   machines as needed.  It is also referred to as "the virtualization
   server" or hypervisor.  It may get instructions from provision
   systems (i.e.,vCenters)to create, modify, terminate VM for each
   tenant.  It may also interact with the NVE Edge to inform the NVE
   about the map or association between vserver, virtual machine and
   network connection.  This interaction can also be used to release
   association between vServer and the NVE Edge.

5.3.  vCenter (management plane function)

   The vCenter is served as a platform for managing in one data center
   not only assignment of virtual machines to the vServer but also
   assignment of resources to the virtual machines and provide a single
   control point to the data center.  It unifies the resources from
   individual vServer to be shared among virtual machines in the entire
   data center.  It may interact with vServer to allocate virtual
   machines to the vServer and monitor performance of each vServer and
   each VM in the data center.  The vCenter may maintain the map from
   vServer to Network connection which contain not not only vServer
   configurations such as vServer name, vServer IP address port number
   but also VM configurations for each tenant end system associated with
   that vServer.  When vCenter hierarchy is used, the root vCenter who
   has global view may interact with the child vCenter to decide which
   child vCenter is responsible for assigning the virtual machine to
   which vServer based on topological information and resource
   utilization information in each data center and local policy
   information.

5.4.  nDirector (Control plane function)

   The nDirector is implemented as part of DC Gateway and sits on top of
   the vCenter in each data center and is served as orchestrator layer
   to allow layer 2 interconnection and forwarding between data centers
   and enable multiple data centers to present as one.  The nDirector
   may interact with the NVE Edge to populate forwarding table in the
   path from the NVE Edge Device to the Tenant End System and react to

   the NVE request to assign network attributes such as VLAN,ACL, QoS
   parameters on all the network elements in the path from NVE device to
   the Tenant End System and manipulates the QoS control information in
   the path between the NVE Edges associated with VMs in communication.
   In addition, the nDirector may distribute mapping table between layer
   2 identity of VM and the NVE Edge associate with that VM to all the
   other NVE Edges and maintain such mapping table in the nDirector.

6.  vServer to vCenter management interface

6.1.  VM Creation

   vCenter requests vServer to create a new virtual machine and allocate
   the resource for its execution.

6.2.  VM Termination

   vCenter requests vServer to delete a virtual machine and clean up the
   underlying resources for that virtual machine.

6.3.  VM Registration

   When a VM is created for one tenant in the vServer, the vServer may
   create VM profile for this tenant containing VM identity,VNID,
   port,VID and registers the VM configuration associated with this
   tenant to the vCenter.  Upon receiving such a registration request,
   vCenter should check if it has already established VM profile for the
   corresponding tenant: if yes, vCenter should update the existing VM
   profile for that tenant, otherwise vCenter should create a new VM
   profile for that tenant.

6.4.  VM Unregistration

   When a VM is removed for one tenant from the vServer, the vServer may
   remove VM profile for this tenant containing VM identity, VNID,
   port,VID and deregisters the VM configuration associated with that
   tenant to the vCenter.  Upon receiving such a deregistration request,
   vCenter should check if it has already established VM profile for
   that tenant: if yes, vCenter should remove the existing VM profile
   for that tenant,otherwise other vCenter should report alert to the
   vServer.

6.5.  VM Bulk Registration

   When a large number of VMs are created in one vServer and share the
   same template, the vSever may create a profile for a group of these
   VMs and send a bulk registration request containing the group
   identifier and associated VM profile to the vCenter.  Upon receiving
   such a bulk registration request, vCenter should create or update the
   profile for a group of these VMs.

6.6.  VM Bulk Unregistration

   When a large number of VMs are removed in one vServer and share the
   same template, the vSever may remove a profile for a group of these
   VMs and send a bulk unregistration request containing the group

   identifier and associated VM profile to the vCenter.  Upon receiving
   such a bulk registration request, vCenter should remove the profile
   for a group of these VMs.

6.7.  VM Configuration Modification

   vCenter requests vServer to update a virtual machine and reallocate
   the resource for its execution.

6.8.  VM Profile Lookup/Discovery

   When a VM1 in one vServer want to communicate with one VM2 in another
   vServer, the client associated with VM1 should check with vCenter
   based on VM2 identity to see if the profile for that VM2 already
   exists and which server maintains that VM configuration.  If yes,
   vCenter should reply to the the client with the address or name of
   the vServer which the VM2 is situated in.

6.9.  VM Relocation

   When vCenter is triggered to move one VM or a group of VMs from one
   source vServer to another destination vServer, the vCenter should
   send a VM relocation request to both vServers and updates its profile
   to indicate the new vServer that maintains the VM configuration for
   that VM or a group of those VMs.  The relocation request will trigger
   the VM image to be moved from the source vServer to the destination
   vServer.

6.10.  VM Replication

   One tenant moves between vServers or between data centers and may, as
   the internet user, want to access applications via the VM without
   service disruption.  In order to achieve this, he can choose to
   access applications via the same VM without moving the VM when he
   moves.  However, the VM he is using may be far away from where he
   stays.  In order to provide better user experience, the tenant may
   request vCenter through the nDirector to move VM to the vServer that
   is more close to where he stays and keeps the service uninterrupted.
   In such case, the vCenter may interact with the vServer that hosts
   the original VM to chooses one vServer that is closer to the tenant
   and moves one copy of the VM image to the destination vServer.

6.11.  VM Report

   When one VM is created, moved, added, removed from the vServer, the
   VM monitor should be enabled to report the status information and
   resource availability of that VM to the vCenter.  In this case,
   vCenter can know which server is overloaded, which server is unused

7.  nDirector to NVE Edge control interface

   Signaling between the nDirector and NVE Device can be used to do
   three things:

      Enforce the network policy for each VM in the path from the NVE
      Edge associated with VM to the Tenant End System.

      Populate forwarding table in the path from the NVE Edge associated
      with VM to the Tenant End System in the data center.

      Populate mapping table in each NVE Edge that is in the virtual
      network across data centers under the control of the nDirector.

   One could reuse existing protocols, among them
   NetConf,SNMP,RSVP,Radius,Diameter, to signal the messages between
   nDirector and NVE Edges.  The nDirector need to know which NVE Edges
   belong to the same virtual network and then the distribute the routes
   between these NVE Edges to each NVE Edges belonging to the same
   virtual network.  In additional the nDirector may interact with the
   NVE Edge and the associated overlay network in the data center in
   response to the provision request from the NVE Edge and populate
   forwarding table to the associated overlay Network elements in the
   data path from the Tenant End System to the NVE Edge and install
   network policy to the network elements in the data path between the
   Tenant End System and the NVE Edge.  For details of Signaling
   control/forward plane information between network virtualization
   edges (NVEs) , please see [I.D-wu-nvo3-nve2nve].

8.  vServer to NVE Edge control interface

   Signaling between vServer and NVE Edge is used to establish mapping
   between the vServer who host VM and network connection which VM
   relies on.  For more details signaling and operation, please see
   relevant NVO3 draft.

9.  Security Considerations

   Threats may arise when VMs move into a hostile VM environment, e.g.,
   when the VM identity is exploited by adversaries to launch denial of
   service or Phishing attacks[Phishing].  Further details are to be
   explored in the future version of this document.
