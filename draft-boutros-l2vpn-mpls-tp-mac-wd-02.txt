1.  Introduction

   An LDP-based MAC Address Withdrawal Mechanism is specified in
   [RFC4762] to remove dynamically learned MAC addresses when the source
   of those addresses can no longer forward traffic.  This is
   accomplished by sending an LDP Address Withdraw Message with a MAC
   List TLV containing the MAC addressed to be removed to all other PEs
   over LDP sessions.  When the number of MAC addresses to be removed is
   large, empty MAC List TLV may be used.  [MAC-OPT] describes an
   optimized MAC withdrawal mechanism which can be used to remove only
   the set of MAC addresses that need to be re-learned in H-VPLS
   networks.  The solution also provides optimized MAC Withdrawal
   operations in PBB-VPLS networks.

   A PW can be signaled via LDP or can be statically provisioned.  In
   the case of static PW, LDP based MAC withdrawal mechanism cannot be
   used.  This is analogous to the problem and solution described in
   [RFC4762]  where PW OAM message has been introduced to carry PW
   status TLV using in-band PW Associated Channel.  In this document, we
   propose to use PW OAM message to withdraw MAC address(es) learned via
   static PW.

3.  MAC Withdraw OAM Message

   LDP provides a reliable packet transport for control plackets for
   dynamic PWs.  This can be contrasted with static PWs which rely on
   re-transmission and acknowledgments (ACK) for reliable OAM packet
   delivery as described in [RFC6478].  The proposed solution for MAC
   withdrawal over static PW also relies on re-transmissions and ACKs.
   However, ACK is mandatory.  A given MAC withdrawal notification is
   sent as a PW OAM message, and the sender keeps re-transmitting the
   message until it receives an ACK for that message.  Once a receiver
   successfully remove MAC address(es) in response to a MAC address
   withdraw OAM message, it should not unnecessarily remove MAC
   address(es) upon getting refresh message(s).  To facilitate this, the
   proposed mechanism uses sequence number, and defines a new TLV to
   carry the sequence number.

   The format of the MAC address withdraw OAM message is shown in Figure
   1.  The PW OAM message header is exactly the same as what is defined
   in [RFC6478].  Since the MAC withdrawal PW OAM message is not
   refreshed forever.  A MAC address withdraw OAM message MUST contain a
   "Sequence Number TLV" otherwise the entire message is dropped.  It
   MAY contain MAC Flush Parameter TLVs defined in [MAC-OPT]  when
   static PWs are deployed in H-VPLS and PBB-VPLS scenarios.  The first
   2 bits of the sequence number TLV are reserved and MUST be set to 0
   on transmit and ignored on receipt.

            Figure 1: MAC Address Withdraw PW OAM Packet Format

   In this section, MAC List TLV and MAC Flush Parameter TLV are
   collectively referred to as "MAC TLV(s)".  The processing rules of
   MAC List TLV are governed by [RFC4762], and the corresponding rules
   of MAC Flush Parameter TLV are governed by [MAC-OPT].

   "TLV Length" is the total length of all TLVs in the message, and
   "Sequence Number TLV Length" is the length of the sequence number
   field.

   A single bit (called A-bit) is set to indicate if a MAC withdraw
   message is for ACK.  Also, ACK does not include MAC TLV(s).

   Only half of the sequence number space is used.  Modular arithmetic
   is used to detect wrapping of sequence number.  When sequence number
   wraps, all MAC addresses are flushed and the sequence number is
   reset.

4.  Operation

   This section describes how the initial MAC withdraw OAM messages are
   sent and retransmitted, as well as how the messages are processed and
   retransmitted messages are identified.

4.1.  Operation of Sender

   Each PW is associated with a counter to keep track of the sequence
   number of the transmitted MAC withdrawal messages.  Whenever a node

Internet-Draft    MAC Withdrawal over Static Pseudowire   September 2013


   sends a new set of MAC TLVs, it increments the transmitted sequence
   number counter, and include the new sequence number in the message.

   The sender expects an ACK from the receiver within a time interval
   which we call "Retransmit Time" which can be either a default or
   configured value.  If the ACK arrives within the Retransmit Time, the
   sender assumes that the message transmission is successful.
   Otherwise, it retransmits the message with the same sequence number
   as the original message.

4.2.  Operation of Receiver

   Each PW is associated with a register to keep track of the sequence
   number of the MAC withdrawal message received last.  Whenever a MAC
   withdrawal message is received, and if the sequence number on the
   message is greater than the value in the register, the MAC
   address(es) contained in the MAC TLV(s) is/are removed, and the
   register is updated with the received sequence number.  The receiver
   sends an ACK whose sequence number is the same as that in the
   received message.

   If the sequence number in the received message is smaller than or
   equal to the value in the register, the MAC TLV(s) is/are not
   processed.  However, an ACK with the received sequence number MUST be
   sent as a response.  The receiver processes the ACK message as an
   acknowledgement for all the MAC withdraw messages sent up to the
   sequence number present in the ACK message and terminates
   retransmission.

   As mentioned above, since only half of the sequence number space is
   used, the receiver MUST use modular arithmetic to detect wrapping of
   the sequence number.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The proposed mechanism requests IANA to a assign new channel type
   (recommended value 0x0028) from the registry named "Pseudowire
   Associated Channel Types".  The description of the new channel type
   is "Pseudowire MAC Withdraw OAM Channel".

   IANA needs to create a new registry for Pseudowire Associated Channel
   TLVs, and create an entry for "Sequence Number TLV".  The recommended
   value is 0x0001.
