     Registering self-generated IPv6 Addresses in DNS using DHCPv6
                  draft-ietf-dhc-addr-registration-03

Abstract

   In networks that are centrally managed, self-generated addresses
   cause some traceability issues due to their decentralized nature.
   One of the most important issues in this regard is the inability to
   register such addresses in DNS.  This document defines a mechanism to
   register self-generated addresses in DNS through a DHCPv6 server.

Internet-Draft          IPv6 Address Registration            August 2013


1.  Introduction

   In several common network scenarios, IPv6 addresses are self-
   generated by the end-hosts by appending a self-generated interface
   identifier to a network-specified prefix.  Examples of self-generated
   addresses include those created using IPv6 Stateless Address
   Configuration [RFC4862] , temporary addresses [RFC4941] and
   Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972] etc.  In
   several tighly controlled networks, hosts with self-generated
   addresses may face some limitations.  One such limitation is related
   to the inability of nodes with self-generated addresses to register
   their IPv6-address-to-FQDN bindings in DNS.  This is related to the
   fact that, in such networks, only certain nodes (e.g.  The DHCPv6
   server) are allowed to update these bindings in order to prevent end-
   hosts from registering arbitrary addresses for their FQDNs or
   associating their addresses with arbitrary domain names.

   For nodes that obtain their addresses through DHCPv6, a solution has
   been specified in [RFC4704].  The solution works by including a
   Client FQDN option in the SOLICIT, REQUEST, RENEW or REBIND messages
   during the process of acquiring an address through DHCPv6.  This
   document provides an analogous mechanism to register self-generated
   addresses in DNS.

   A new ADDR-REGISTRATION-REQUEST DHCPv6 message type is defined to
   initiate the address registration request, and two new Status codes
   is defined to indicate registration errors on the server side.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Solution Overview

   After successfully assigning a self-generated IPv6 address on one of
   its interfaces, an end-host implementing this specification SHOULD
   send an ADDR-REGISTRATION-REQUEST message to a DHCPv6 address
   registration server.  After receiving the address registration
   request, the DHCPv6 server registers the IPv6 address to FQDN binding
   towards a configured DNS server.  An acknowledgement MAY be sent back
   to the end host to indicate whether or not the registration operation
   succeeded..

4.  DHCPv6 ADDR-REGISTRATION-REQUEST Message

   The DHCPv6 client sends an ADDR-REGISTRATION-REQUEST message to a
   server to request an address to be registered in the DNS.  The format
   of the ADDR-REGISTRATION-REQUEST message is described as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3

     .                            options                            .

     |                                                               |

   identifier option and MUST contain the IA_NA option and the DHCPv6
   FQDN option [RFC4704].

   Servers MUST discard any ADDR-REGISTRATION-REQUEST messages that do
   not include a Client Identifier option or that do include a Server

   Identifier option.


5.  DHCPv6 Address Registration Procedure

   The DHCPv6 protocol is used as the address registration protocol when
   a DHCPv6 server performs the role of an address registration server.
   The DHCPv6 IA_NA option [RFC3315] and the DHCPv6 FQDN option
   [RFC4704] are reused in order to fulfill the address registration
   interactions.

5.1.  DHCPv6 Address Registration Request

   The end-host sends a DHCPv6 ADDR-REGISTRATION-REQUEST message to the
   address registration server to the All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers
   multicast address (ff02::1:2).

   The end-host MUST include a Client Identifier option in the ADDR-
   REGISTRATION-REQUEST message to identify itself to the server.  The
   DHCPv6 ADDR-REGISTRATION-REQUEST message MUST contain exactly one
   IA_NA option and exactly one FQDN option.  The IA_NA option MUST
   contain at least one IA Address option.

   After receiving this ADDR-REGISTRATION-REQUEST message, the address
   registration server MUST register the binding between the provided
   FQDN and address(es) in DNS.  If the DHCPv6 server does not support
   address registration function, a Reply message with includes a Status
   Code option with the value the RegistrationNotSupported (TBA2) MAY be
   sent back to the initiated client.

5.2.  Acknowledging successful registration

   After all the addresses have been successfully registered in DNS, the
   address registration server MAY send a Reply message as the response
   to registration requests.  The server generates a Reply message and
   includes a Status Code option with value Success, a Server Identifier
   option with the server's DUID, and a Client Identifier option with
   the client's DUID.  For each IA in the Release message for which the
   server does not succeed in registering, the server adds an IA option
   using the IAID from the ADDR-REGISTRATION-REQUEST message, and
   includes a Status Code option with the value RegistrationDenied
   (TBA3) in the IA option.  No other options are included in the IA
   option.


6.  Security Considerations

   An attacker may attempt to register large number of addresses in

   quick succession in order to overwhelm the address registration
   server.  These attacks may be prevented generic DHCPv6 protection by
   using the AUTH option [RFC3315] or Secure DHCPv6
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-secure-dhcpv6].


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new DHCPv6 message, the ADDR-REGISTRATION-
   REQUEST message (TBA1) described in Section 5, that requires an
   allocation out of the registry defined at

   http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters/

   This document defines two new DHCPv6 Status code, the
   RegistrationNotSupported (TBA2) and RegistrationDenied (TBA3)
   described in Section 6, that requires an allocation out of the
   registry defined at

   http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters/
