1.  Introduction

   Querying and retrieving registration data from registries are defined
   in the Registration Data Access Protocol(RDAP)[I-D.ietf-weirds-rdap-
   query][I-D.ietf-weirds-using-http][I-D.ietf-weirds-json-response].
   These documents do not specify where to send the queries.  This
   document specifies a method to find which server is authoritative to
   answer queries for the requested scope.

   (author note: should it have some text on various possibilities that
   have been discussed, such as IETF84...?)

   The proposed mechanism is based on that allocation data for domain
   names and IP addresses are maintained by IANA, are publicly available
   and are in a structured format.  The mechanism assumes some data
   structure within these registries and request IANA to modify these
   registries for the specific purpose of RDAP use.  An RDAP client
   fetches the registries, extract the data and then do a match with the
   query data to find the authoritative registration data server and
   appropriate query base URL.

2.  Domain Name Registry

   The domain names authoritative registration data service is found by
   doing the longest match of the target domain name with the values of
   the Domain column in the IANA Domain Name registry[domainreg].  The
   value of the "RDAP URL" column is the base RDAP url as described in
   [I-D.ietf-weirds-rdap-query].

   For example, a RDAP query for example.com matches the .com entry in
   the Domain column of the registry.  The RDAP server URL for this
   address is located in the corresponding "RDAP URL" column for that
   entry, which could be http://rdap.example.org/rdap.

3.  Internet Numbers Registry

3.1.  IPv4 Address Space

   The IPv4 address space authoritative registration data service is
   found by doing a longest match of the target address with the values
   of the Prefix column in the IANA IPv4 address space
   registry[ipv4reg].  The value of the "RDAP URL" column is the base
   RDAP url as described in [I-D.ietf-weirds-rdap-query].

   For example, a query for "192.0.2.0/24" matches the "192/8" entry in
   the Prefix column of the registry.  The RDAP server URL for this
   address is located in the corresponding "RDAP URL" column for that
   entry, which could be http://rdap.example.org/rdap.

3.2.  IPv6 Address Space

   The IPv6 address space authoritative registration data service is
   found by doing a longest match of the target address with the values
   of the Prefix column in the IANA IPv6 address space
   registry[ipv6reg].  The value of the "RDAP URL" column is the base
   RDAP url as described in [I-D.ietf-weirds-rdap-query].

   For example, a query for "2001:db8::/32" matches the "2001/16" entry
   in the Prefix column of the registry.  The RDAP server URL for this
   address is located in the corresponding "RDAP URL" column for that
   entry, which could be http://rdap.example.org/rdap.

3.3.  Autonomous Systems

   The Autonomous Systems (AS) authoritative registration data service
   is found by identifying the range in which the target Autonomous
   System is with the values of the Number column in the IANA Autonomous
   Systems (AS) Numbers registry[asreg].  The value of the "RDAP URL"
   column is the base RDAP url as described in
   [I-D.ietf-weirds-rdap-query].

   For example, a query for AS 65411 matches the "64512-65534" entry in
   the Number column of the registry.  The RDAP server URL for this
   address is located in the corresponding "RDAP URL" column for that
   entry, which could be http://rdap.example.org/rdap.

4.  Nameserver

   TBD

5.  Entity

   TBD

6.  Non-existent Entries or RDAP URL Values

   The registries may not contain the requested value or the RDAP URL
   value may be empty.  In these cases, there is no known RDAP server
   for that requested value and the client should provide an appropriate
   error message to the user.

7.  Deployment Considerations

   This method relies on the fact that RDAP clients are fetching the
   IANA XML registries.  Clients SHOULD not fetch every time the XML
   files.  Clients should rely on HTTP headers to verify if the registry
   has changed since last time it was fetched.

   IANA should make sure that the service of those registries is able to
   cope with a larger demand and should take appropriate measures such
   as caching and load balancing.

   This specification makes no assumption on how the authorities of
   registration data may work together on sharing their information for
   a common service.

8.  Security Considerations

   TBD

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to do the following:

   o  Add the "RDAP URL" column to the IPv4 Address Space, IPv6 Address
      Space and Autonomous Systems Numbers registries.  The same
      entities who are registrants for these spaces are entitled to
      provide the RDAP URL value for their respective space.

   o  Create a new registry of domain names with the following columns:
      Domain and RDAP URL.  The content should be initially populated by
      an extract of the Root zone database.  A change happens in the
      database may trigger a change in that new registry.  The same
      entities who are registrants for the root zone database entries

      are entitled to provide the RDAP URL value for their domain.  IANA
      shall update its procedures to include the provisioning of these
      values.
