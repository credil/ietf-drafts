Internet-Draft                  STUN URI                      March 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the syntax and semantics of the Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for the Session Traversal Utilities
   for NAT (STUN) protocol.

   STUN is a protocol that serves as a tool for other protocols in
   dealing with Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal.  It can be
   used by an endpoint to determine the IP address and port allocated to
   it by a NAT, to perform connectivity checks between two endpoints,
   and used as a keepalive protocol to maintain NAT bindings.  RFC 5389
   [RFC5389] defines the specifics of the STUN protocol.

   The 'stun/stuns' URI scheme is used to designate a standalone STUN
   server or any Internet host performing the operations of a STUN
   server in the context of STUN usages (Section 14 RFC 5389 [RFC5389]).
   With the advent of standards such as WEBRTC [WEBRTC], we anticipate a
   plethora of endpoints and web applications to be able to identify and
   communicate with such a STUN server to carry out the STUN protocol.
   This also implies those endpoints and/or applications to be
   provisioned with appropriate configuration required to identify the
   STUN server.  Having an inconsistent syntax has its drawbacks and can
   result in non-interoperable solutions.  It can result in solutions
   that are ambiguous and have implementation limitations on the
   different aspects of the syntax and alike.  The 'stun/stuns' URI
   scheme helps alleviate most of these issues by providing a consistent
   way to describe, configure and exchange the information identifying a
   STUN server.  This would also prevent the shortcomings inherent with
   encoding similar information in non-uniform syntaxes such as the ones
   proposed in the WEBRTC Standards [WEBRTC], for example.

   A reference implementation [REF-IMPL] is available.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", and "NOT RECOMMENDED" are
   appropriate when valid exceptions to a general requirement are known
   to exist or appear to exist, and it is infeasible or impractical to
   enumerate all of them.  However, they should not be interpreted as
   permitting implementors to fail to implement the general requirement
   when such failure would result in interoperability failure.

3.  Syntax of a STUN or STUNS URI

3.1.  URI Scheme Syntax

   The "stun" URI takes the following form (the example below is non-
   normative):

      stun:<stun-host>:<stun-port>
      stuns:<stun-host>:<stun-port>

   Note that the <port> part and the preceding ":" (colon) character, is
   OPTIONAL.

   A STUN/STUNS URI has the following formal ABNF syntax [RFC5234]:

   stunURI       = scheme ":" stun-host [ ":" stun-port ]
   scheme        = "stun" / "stuns"
   stun-host     = IP-literal / IPv4address / reg-name
   stun-port     = *DIGIT
   IP-literal    = "[" ( IPv6address / IPvFuture  ) "]"
   IPvFuture     = "v" 1*HEXDIG "." 1*( unreserved / sub-delims / ":" )
   IPv6address   =                              6( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   /                       "::" 5( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [               h16 ] "::" 4( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [ *1( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::" 3( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [ *2( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::" 2( h16 ":" ) ls32
                   / [ *3( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"    h16 ":"   ls32
                   / [ *4( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"              ls32
                   / [ *5( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"              h16
                   / [ *6( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"
   h16           = 1*4HEXDIG
   ls32          = ( h16 ":" h16 ) / IPv4address
   IPv4address   = dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet
   dec-octet     = DIGIT                 ; 0-9
                   / %x31-39 DIGIT       ; 10-99
                   / "1" 2DIGIT          ; 100-199
                   / "2" %x30-34 DIGIT   ; 200-249
                   / "25" %x30-35        ; 250-255
   reg-name      = *( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims )

   <unreserved>, <sub-delims>, and <pct-encoded> are specified in
   [RFC3986].  The core rules <DIGIT> and <HEXDIGIT> are used as
   described in Appendix B of RFC 5234 [RFC5234].

3.2.  URI Scheme Semantics

   The STUN protocol supports sending messages over UDP, TCP or TLS-
   over-TCP.  The "stuns" URI scheme SHALL be used when STUN is run over

Internet-Draft                  STUN URI                      March 2012


   TLS-over-TCP (or in the future DTLS-over-UDP) and the "stun" scheme
   SHALL be used otherwise.

   The required <stun-host> part of the "stun" URI denotes the STUN
   server host.

   For the optional DNS Discovery procedure mentioned in the Section 9
   of RFC5389, "stun" URI scheme implies UDP as the transport protocol
   for SRV lookup and "stuns" URI scheme indicates TCP as the transport
   protocol.

   The <stun-port> part, if present, denotes the port on which the STUN
   server is awaiting connection requests.  If it is absent, the default
   port is 3478 for both UDP and TCP and 5349 for STUN over TLS as per
   Section 9 of RFC 5389 [RFC5389].


4.  Security Considerations

   The "stun" and "stuns" URI schemes do not introduce any specific
   security issues beyond the security considerations discussed in
   [RFC3986].
