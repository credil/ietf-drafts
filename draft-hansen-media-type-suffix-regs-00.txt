1.  Introduction

   [RFC3023] created the +xml suffix convention that may be used by
   media types whose representation uses XML underneath, that is, they
   could have been successfully parsed as if the media type had been
   application/xml in addition to their being parsed as their media type
   that is using the +xml suffix.  [I-D.ietf-appsawg-media-type-regs]
   defines a registry to be used for future Structured Syntax Suffixes.

   A variety of Structured Syntax Suffixes have already been used in
   some Media Type registration, in particular "+json", "+der",
   "+fastinfoset" and "+wbxml".  This document defines and registers
   these four Structured Syntax Suffixes in the Structured Syntax Suffix
   registry.

   Discussion of this document should occur in the Apps Area Working
   Group (apps-discuss@ietf.org).

2.  When to Use these Structured Syntax Suffixes

   Each of the Structured Syntax Suffixes defined in this document are
   appropriate for use when the media type identifies the semantics of
   the protocol payload.  That is, knowing the semantics of the specific
   media type provides for more specific processing of the content than
   that afforded by generic processing of the underlying representation.

   At the same time, using the suffix provides receivers of the media
   types to do generic processing of the underyling representation in
   cases where they do not need to handle specially the specific
   semantics of the exact media type.

3.  The +json Structured Syntax Suffix

   [RFC4627] defines the "application/json" media type.  The suffix
   "+json" may be used with any media type whose representation follows
   that established for "application/json".  The Structured Syntax
   Suffix registration form follows:

   Name                JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
   +suffix             +json
   References          [RFC4627]
   Encoding considerations Per [RFC4627], JSON may be represented using
                       UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32.  When JSON is written
                       in UTF-8, JSON is 8bit compatible.  When JSON is
                       written in UTF-16 or UTF-32, JSON is binary.

4.  The +der Structured Syntax Suffix

   The CCITT defined the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) message
   transfer syntax in [CCITT.X690.2002].  The suffix "+der" may be used
   with any media type whose representation follows the DER message
   transfer syntax.  The Structured Syntax Suffix registration form
   follows:

   Name                Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) message
                       transfer syntax
   +suffix             +der
   References          [CCITT.X690.2002]
   Encoding considerations DER is a binary encoding.
   Interoperability considerations n/a
   Security considerations There are no security considerations inherent
                       in DER. Each individual media type registered
                       with a +der suffix may have additional security
                       considerations.

5.  The +fastinfoset Structured Syntax Suffix

   The ITU-T and ISO have defined the Fast Infoset document format as a
   binary representation of the XML Information Set in [ITU.X891.2005]
   and [ISO.IEC.24824-1.2007].  These documents further define the
   "application/fastinfoset" media type.  The suffix "+fastinfoset" may
   be used with any media type whose representation follows that
   established for "application/fastinfoset".  The Structured Syntax
   Suffix registration form follows:

   Name                Fast Infoset document format
   +suffix             +infoset
   References          [ITU.X891.2005] and [ISO.IEC.24824-1.2007]
   Encoding considerations Fast Infoset is a binary encoding.  The
                       binary, quoted-printable and base64 content-
                       transfer-encodings are suitable for use with Fast
                       Infoset.
   Interoperability considerations n/a
   Security considerations There are no security considerations inherent
                       in Fast Infoset.  Each individual media type
                       registered with a +der suffix may have additional
                       security considerations.

6.  The +wbxml Structured Syntax Suffix

Internet-Draft       Additional Media Type Suffixes           April 2012


   The WAP Forum has defined the WAP Binary XML (WBXML) document format
   as a binary representation of XML in [WBXML].  This document further
   defines the "application/vnd.wap.wbxml" media type.  The suffix
   "+wbxml" may be used with any media type whose representation follows
   that established for "application/vnd.wap.wbxml".  The Structured
   Syntax Suffix registration form follows:

   Name                WAP Binary XML (WBXML) document format
   +suffix             +wbxml
   References          [WBXML]
   Encoding considerations WBXML is a binary encoding.
   Interoperability considerations n/a
   Security considerations There are no security considerations inherent
                       in WBXML.  Each individual media type registered
                       with a +der suffix may have additional security
                       considerations.
