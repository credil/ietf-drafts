3.  Scenario of mobile router mobility

   This section discusses the scenario of mobile router mobility.  The
   scenario of mobile router mobility is illustrated in figure 1.  The
   mobile router is located in the vehicle.  The mobile router works as
   the network access point for the mobile router users.  The mobile
   router user include vehicle applications and other on board system.
   Example of such application may include vehicle security and
   monitoring system.  The users or other vehicle may access the vehicle
   application from Internet or from other vehicle.  The requirement for
   the mobile router in this architecture is that it should allow the
   user to access the vehicle application even when the vehicle is
   moving.

4.  Architecture and work flow of the mobile router mobility solution

   The architecture of the mobile router mobility solution is
   illustrated in figure 2.  The architecture is composed in three
   component: the mobile router, the home agent and the DNS.  The
   vehicle application runs in the mobile router environment.  The users
   can access to the vehicle application from Internet when the vehicle
   is moving.  The key problem is that how to find the vehicle's
   identity when the vehicle is moving.  The solution discussed in this
   document uses domain name as the vehicle's application identity.

   Figure 3.  Flow chart of mobile router mobility solution

   1.  Binding update  When the mobile router is powered on, it will
      send DSMIPv6 binding update to the home agent.  The binding update
      request contains the identification of the mobile router, the home
      address of the mobile router, the access network allocated car-of
      address of the mobile router.  For the mobile router's first time
      network attachment, the home address could be set to all zero.

   2.  Binding cache update and IP address allocation  The home agent
      receives the binding update, it will register the binding cache
      entry and allocate IP address for the mobile router.  This IP
      address is the home address of the mobile router that used in the
      period of communication session.

   3.  Dome name register  The home agent send the domain name register
      request to the DNS system.  The DNS record optional include both
      the home address of the mobile router and the tunnel type and port
      information.  See [RFC2136].

   4.  Binding Ack  After the success register of the mobile router's
      domain name, the home agent send binding ack message to the mobile
      router to trigger the mobility tunnel establishment.

   5.  Mobility tunnel establishment  After the success receiving of
      binding ack message, the mobile router set up the mobility tunnel
      between the mobile router and the home agent.

   6.  DNS query from the user/other vehicle  The user or other vehicles
      send the DNS query request to the DNS system to get the IP address
      and port information of the mobile router.  The DNS system will
      response to the DNS query request with the mobile router's IP
      address and other information(port number and tunnel type)

   7.  Service connection establish  The user or other vehicles
      application use the IP address and port information to establish
      the service level connection to the mobile router. e.g. TCP
      connection.

   TBD
