<!--

- Is tying this whole draft with particular routing protocol good?
 - another option: General idea + practical transport drafts?

- Terminology

 - is sloppy in general; for example, domain<>zone

 - no good term for 'base' DNS-SD domain which is used to look up domain search
 lists etc?

      <t>This document describes how a proxy functioning between Unicast
      DNS-Based Service Discovery and Multicast DNS can be automatically
      configured using automatically configured routing protocol or some
      other network-level state sharing mechanism. Zero-configuration
      OSPFv3 is used to describe one concrete way to implement this
      scheme. </t>

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>Section 3 ("Hybrid Proxy Operation") of <xref
      target="I-D.cheshire-mdnsext-hybrid"/> describes how to translate
      queries from Unicast DNS-Based Service Discovery described in <xref
      target="RFC6763"/> to Multicast DNS described in <xref
      target="RFC6762"/>, and how to filter the responses and translate
      them back to unicast DNS.</t>

      <t>This document describes what sort of configuration the
      participating DNS servers require, as well as how it can be provided
      using auto-configured OSPFv3 described in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig"/> and a naming scheme which
      does not even need to be same across the whole covered network. The
      scheme can be used to provision both forward and reverse DNS zones
      which employ hybrid proxy for heavy lifting. 
      </t>

      <t>While this document describes the data to be transferred in
      auto-configured OSPFv3 TLVs, in principle same scheme could work
      across other routing protocols, or even some non-routing protocol, as
      long as the consistent state for it is available across the whole
      covered network (by for example site-scoped multicast, or some other
      flooding scheme).</t>

      <t>We go through the mandatory specification of the language used in
      <xref target="kwd"/>, then describe what needs to be configured in
      hybrid proxies and participating DNS servers across the network in
      <xref target="what"/>. How the data is exchanged in OSPFv3 is
      described in <xref target="how"/>. Finally, some overall notes on
      desired behavior of different router components is mentioned in <xref
      target="howto"/>. </t>

    </section>


    <section anchor="kwd" title='Requirements language'>

      <t>In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST, "MUST NOT",
      "OPTIONAL", "RECOMMENDED", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT", are to be
      interpreted as described in <xref target='RFC2119' />.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="what" title="Hybrid proxy - what to configure">

      <t>Beyond the low-level translation mechanism between unicast and
      multicast service discovery, the hybrid proxy draft <xref
      target="I-D.cheshire-mdnsext-hybrid"/> describes just that there have
      to be NS records pointing to hybrid proxy responsible for each link
      within the covered network.</t>

      <t>The links to be covered is also non-trivial choice; we can use the
      border discovery functionality (if available) to determine internal
      and external links. Or we can use OSPFv3 presence (or lack of it) on
      a link to determine internal links within the covered network, and
      some other signs (depending on the deployment) such as DHCPv6 Prefix
      Delegation (as described in <xref target="RFC3633"/> to determine
      external links that should not be covered.</t>

      <t>For each covered link we want forward DNS zone delegation to an
      appropriate router which is connected to a link, and running hybrid
      proxy. We also want to populate reverse DNS zone similarly per each
      prefix in use. Links' forward DNS zone names should be unique.</t>

      <t>There should be DNS-SD domain search list provided for the
      network's domain which contains domain for each physical link only
      once, regardless of how many routers and hybrid proxy implementations
      are connected to it. </t>

      <t>Yet another case to consider is the list of DNS-SD domains that we
      want hosts to enumerate for domain lists. Typically, it contains
      only that the network's domain, but there may be also other networks
      we may want to pretend to be local but are in different scope, or
      controlled by different organization. For example, a home user might
      see both home domain's services (TBD-TLD), as well as ISP's services
      under isp.example.com.</t>

      <section anchor="conflict" title="Conflict resolution with OSPFv3">

        <t>Any naming-related choice on a router may have conflicts in the
        network. </t>

        <t>We use similar conflict resolution scheme as described in the
        prefix assignment draft<xref
        target="I-D.arkko-homenet-prefix-assignment"/>. That is, if a
        conflict is encountered, the router with highest router ID MUST
        keep the name they have chosen. The one(s) with lower router ID
        MUST either try different one (that is not in use at all according
        to the current link state information), or choose not to publish
        the name altogether.</t>

        <t>If router needs to pick a different name, any algorithm works,
        although simple algorithm choice is just like the one described in
        Multicast DNS<xref target="RFC6762"/>: append -2, -3, and so forth,
        until there are no conflicts in the network for the given name.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Per-link DNS-SD forward zone names">

        <t>How to name the links of a whole network in automated fashion? Two
        different approaches seem obvious:

        <list style="numbers">
          <t>
            Unique link name based - (unique-link).(domain).
          </t>
          <t>
            Router and link name - (link).(router).(domain).
          </t>
        </list>

        The first choice is appealing as it can be much more friendly
        (especially given manual configuration). For example, it could mean
        just lan.example.com and wlan.example.com for a simple home
        network. The second choice, on the other hand, has a nice property
        of being local choice as long as router name can be made
        unique.</t>

        <t>The type of naming scheme to use can be left as implementation
        option. And the actual names themselves SHOULD be also overridable,
        if the end-user wants to customize them in some way. </t>

      </section>

      <section title="Reasonable defaults">

        <t>Note that any manual configuration, which SHOULD be possible,
        MUST override the defaults provided here or chosen by the creator
        of the implementation.</t>

        <section title="Network-wide unique link name (scheme 1)">

          <t>It is not obvious how to produce network-wide unique link
          names for the (unique-link).(domain) scheme. One option would be
          to base it on type of physical network layer, and then hope that
          the number of the networks won't be significant enough to confuse
          (e.g. "lan", or "wlan"). </t>

          <t>In general network-wide unique link names should be only used
          in small networks. Given larger network, after conflict
          resolution, finding which network is 'lan-42.example.com'
          may be challenging.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="rname" title="Router name (scheme 2)">

          <t>Recommendation is to use some short form which indicates the
          type of router it is, for example, "openwrt.example.com". As the
          name is visible to users, it should be kept as short as
          possible. If theory even more exact model could be helpful, for
          example, "openwrt-buffalo-wzr-600-dhr.example.com".  In practise,
          though, providing some other records indicating exact router
          information (and access to management UI) might be more sensible.
          </t>

          <t>If scheme 2 is used, and there is no desire to implement
          conflict resolution related TLV described in <xref
          target="router-name-tlv"/>, a safe default might be to default to
          router ID; that is, use as router name value such as r-(router ID
          as single 32-bit number). It is guaranteed to be unique across
          the network, but not as user-friendly as the descriptive router
          name promoted here.</t>

        </section>

        <section anchor="lname" title="Link name (scheme 2)">

          <t>Recommendation for (link) portion of (link).(router).(domain)
          is to use either physical network layer type as base, possibly
          even just interface name on the router, if it's descriptive
          enough, for example, eth0.router1.example.com and
          wlan0.router1.example.com may be good enough. </t>

    </section>
    <section anchor="how" title="OSPFv3 auto-configuration TLVs">

      <t>To implement this specification fully, support for following three
      different new OSPFv3 auto-configuration TLVs is needed. However, only
      the DNS Delegated Zone TLVs MUST be supported, and the other two
      SHOULD be supported. </t>

      <section anchor="delegated-zone-tlv" title="DNS Delegated Zone TLV">

        <t>This TLV is effectively a combined NS and A/AAAA record for a
        zone. It MUST be supported by implementations conforming to this
        specification. Implementations SHOULD provide forward zone per link
        (or optimizing a bit, zone per link with Multicast DNS
        traffic). Implementations MAY provide reverse zone per prefix using
        this same mechanism. If multiple routers advertise same reverse
        zone, it should be assumed that they all have access to the
        link with that prefix. However, as noted in <xref
        target="ospf-req"/>, mainly only the router with highest router ID
        on the link should publish this TLV.</t>

        <t>This TLV is used to announce address of a fallback recursive DNS
        server (provided by e.g. ISP). If the DNS server
        implementations used in the network are not full recursive resolver
        implementations, they may respond to network-specific queries
        within network, and forward the rest to the provided DNS
        servers. Even recursive resolver implementations may want to use
        these servers, if available, for better caching and therefore more
        responsive user experience.</t>

        <t>Typically, these addresses are gleaned from (for example) a

        <t>Any router on the home network can publish 0-N of these TLVs,

      <section title="Hybrid proxy">

        <t>The hybrid proxy implementation SHOULD support both forward
        zones, and IPv4 and IPv6 reverse zones. It SHOULD also detect
        whether or not there are any Multicast DNS entities on a link, and
        make that information available to OSPFv3 daemon. This can be done by
        (for example) passively monitoring traffic on all covered links,
        and doing infrequent service enumerations on links that seem to be
        up, but without any Multicast DNS traffic (if so desired). </t>

        <t>Hybrid proxy SHOULD also publish it's own name via Multicast DNS
        (both forward A/AAAA records, as well as reverse PTR records) to
        facilitate applications that trace network topology.

      <section anchor="ospf-req" title="OSPFv3 daemon">

        <t>OSPFv3 daemon should avoid publishing TLVs about links that have
        no Multicast DNS traffic to keep the DNS-SD browse domain list as
        concise as possible. It also SHOULD NOT publish delegated zones for
        links that it does not have highest router ID that supports this
        specification. (Support for this specification can be deduced by
        e.g. presence of any TLVs from this draft advertised by a router.)
        </t>

        <t>OSPFv3 daemon (or other entity with access to the TLVs) SHOULD
        generate zone information for DNS implementation that will be used
        to serve the (domain) zone to hosts. Domain Name TLV described in
        <xref target="domain-name-tlv"/> should be used as base for the
        zone, and then all DNS Delegated Zones described in <xref

    <section title="Security Considerations">

      <t>There is a trade-off between security and zero-configuration in

      local spoofing attacks. We assume that this scheme is used either
      within (lower layer) secured networks, or with
      not-quite-zero-configuration routing protocol set-up which has
      authentication.</t>

      <t>If some sort of dynamic inclusion of links to be covered using

<section title="OSPFv3-DNS interaction">

      <t>Given implementation that chooses to use the second naming scheme
      (link).(router).(domain), and no configuration whatsoever, here's
      what happens (the steps are interleaved in practise but illustrated
      here in order):</t>
      <t>
      <list style="numbers">
          
        <t>OSPFv3 auto-configuration takes place, routers get their
        router IDs. For ease of illustration, CER winds up with 2, IR1
        with 3, and IR2 with 1. </t>
        
        <t>Prefix delegation takes place. IR1 winds up with
        2001:db8:1:1::/64 for LAN and 
        2001:db8:1:2::/64 for WLAN. IR2 winds up with
        2001:db8:2:1::/64 for LAN and 
        2001:db8:2:2::/64 for WLAN. </t>

        <t>IR1 is assumed to be reachable at 2001:db8:1:1::1 and IR2 at
      2001:db8:2:1::1. </t>
      

        <t>Each router wants to be called 'router' due to lack of
        branding in drafts. They announce that using the router name TLV
        defined in <xref target="router-name-tlv" />. They also
        advertise their local zones, but as that information may change,
        it's omitted here.</t>
        
        <t>Conflict resolution ensues. As IR1 has highest router ID, it
        becomes "router". CER and IR2 have to rename, and (depending on
        timing) one of them becomes "router-2" and other one
        "router-3". Let us assume IR2 is "router-2". During conflict
        resolution, each router publishes TLVs for it's own set of
        delegated zones. </t>

        <t>CER learns ISP-provided domain "isp.example.com" using DHCPv6
        domain list option defined in <xref target="RFC3646"/>. The

      <t>So, what do the hosts receive from the routers? Using

      server address should be one (or multiple) that point at DNS server
      that has the zone information described in <xref
      target="example-dns-zone"/>. Domain list provided to hosts should
      contain both "example.com" (the hybrid-enabled domain), as well as the
      externally learned domain "isp.example.com".</t>

      <t>When hosts start using DNS-SD, they should check both
      b._dns-sd._udp.example.com, as well as b._dns-sd._udp.isp.example.com
      for list of concrete domains to browse, and as a result services from
      two different domains will seem to be available.</t>

    <section title="Implementation">

      <t>There is an prototype implementation of this draft (and
      transitively also of <xref target="I-D.cheshire-mdnsext-hybrid"/>) at
      <eref target="https://github.com/fingon/hnet-core/">hnet-core github
      repository</eref> which contains variety of other homenet WG-related
      things' implementation too.</t>
      
      <t>hp.lua binary can be used to start hybrid proxy either as
      one-router stand-alone implementation (that can be used to e.g. use
      statically configured DNS zones), or as part of zeroconf OSPFv3
      configured set of proxies.</t>

      <t>Sample usage case:</t>
      <figure>
        <artwork>
# sudo lua hp.lua eth0 eth1
.. no output ..
        </artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>Given the command, hybrid proxy is started for interfaces eth0 and
      eth1, and it will publish DNS zones l-eth0.r-router.home,
      l-eth1.r-router.home (and home zone with relevant DNS-SD sub-zone,
      and default forward behavior) in DNS port. It has -h option for
      seeing various options that can be set, notable one being --ospf (use
      OSPFv3 autoconfigured hnet infrastructure). </t>

      <t>
        Disclaimer: The set-up of third-party libraries etc to get the
        implementation running may be painful and is omitted here. Use of
        ready UML NetKit-based test environment or building image for a
        real router using <eref

    <section title="Why not just proxy Multicast DNS?">

      <t>Over the time number of people have asked me about how, why, and
      if we should proxy (originally) link-local Multicast DNS over
      multiple links.</t>

      <t>At some point I meant to write a draft about this, but I think I'm
      too lazy; so some notes left here for general amusement of people
      (and to be removed if this ever moves beyond discussion piece).</t>

      <section title="General problems">

        <t>There are two main reasons why Multicast DNS is not proxyable in
        the general case.</t>

        <t>First reason is the conflict resolution depends on ordering
        which depends on the RRsets staying constant. That is not possible
        across multiple links (due to e.g. link-local addresses having to
        be filtered). Therefore, conflict resolution breaks, or at least
        requires ugly hacks to work around.</t>
        
        <t>A workaround for this is to make sure that in conflict
        resolution, propagated resources always loses. Due to conflict
        handling ordering logic, and the arbitrary order in which the
        original records may be in, this is non-trivial. </t>
        
        <t>Second reason is timing, which is relatively tight in the
        conflict resolution phase, especially given lossy and/or high
        latency networks.</t>

      </section>
      <section title="Stateless proxying problems">

        <t>In general, typical stateless proxy has to involve flooding, as
        Multicast DNS assumes that most messages are received by every
        host. And it won't scale very well, as a result.
        </t>

        <t>The conflict resolution is also harder without state. It may
        result in Multicast DNS responder being in constant probe-announce
        loop, when it receives altered records, notes that it's the one
        that should own the record. Given stateful proxying, this would be
        just a transient problem but designing stateless proxy that won't
        cause this is non-trivial exercise.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Stateful proxying problems">


        <t>One option is to write proxy that learns state from one link,
        and propagates it in some way to other links in the network. </t>

        <t>A big problem with this case lies in the fact that due to
        conflict resolution concerns above, it is easy to accidentally send
        packets that will (possibly due to host mobility) wind up at the
        originator of the service, who will then perform renaming. That can
        be alleviated, though, given clever hacks with conflict resolution
        order. </t>

        <t>The stateful proxying may be also too slow to occur within the
        timeframe allocated for announcing, leading to excessive later
        renamings based on delayed finding of duplicate services with same
        name</t>

        <t>A work-around exists for this though; if the game doesn't work
        for you, don't play it. One option would be simply not to propagate
        ANY records for which conflict has seen even once. This would work,
        but result in rather fragile, lossy service discovery
        infrastructure.</t>

        <t>There are some other small nits too; for example, Passive
        Observation Of Failure (POOF) will not work given stateful
        proxying. Therefore, it leads to requiring somewhat shorter TTLs,
        perhaps. </t>
