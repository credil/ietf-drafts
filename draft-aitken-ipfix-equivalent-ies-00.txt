   Abstract 
    
     This document proposes a method for IPFIX Exporting Processes 
     to inform Collecting Processes of equivalent Information 
     Elements, so that the Collecting Process can understand the 
     equivalence and be enabled to process data across a change of 
     Information Elements.

Internet-Draft    Reporting Equivalent IPFIX IEs          Feb 2013 
 

1  Introduction 
    
   The IPFIX Protocol [RFC5101] can export a large number of 
   Information Elements, including standard elements specified in 
   the IPFIX information model [RFC5102, IANA-IPFIX], Enterprise-
   Specific elements [RFC5101], and elements which are backwards 
   compatible with NetFlow Version 9 [RFC3954]. 
    
   From time to time, an Exporting Process may export the same 
   information using different Information Elements from before.  
    
   Several scenarios (use cases) can be envisaged: 
    
     . Enterprise-specific Information Elements have been 
       standardised, so the Exporting Process is changed to export 
       the IANA standard Information Elements [IANA-IPFIX] rather 
       than the Enterprise-specific Information Elements. 
    
     . The Exporting Process is changed to export IANA standard 
       Information Elements [IANA-IPFIX] rather than NetFlow 
       version 9 fields [RFC3954]. 
    
     . The Exporting Process is updated to export different 
       Enterprise-specific Information Elements. 
    
     . An updated Metering Process requests that the Exporting 
       Process exports using different Information Elements from 
       before. 
    
   In each case it's important to note that the same information is 
   being exported. The only change is in the Information Element 
   used to export the information. 
    
   Since different Information Elements are now being used to 
   express the same information, the Collecting Process cannot 
   process data received before the change with data received after 
   the change, because the Collecting Process does not know that 
   these Information Elements are related. e.g. it's not possible 
   to compare, aggregate, or sort data across such a change without 
   first understanding that the old and new Information Elements 
   are equivalent. 
    
   Furthermore, it's impossible for every Collecting Process to 
   know how each IANA standard Information Element [IANA-IPFIX] 
   relates to every company's Enterprise-Specific Information 
   Elements. ie, a Collecting Process from company X cannot be 
   expected to know that company Y's Exporting Process exports 
   Enterprise-specific field Z which is now equivalent to a certain 
   IANA standard element. 
    
   This document proposes a method for Exporting Processes to 
   inform Collecting Processes of such equivalence, so that the 
   Collecting Process is able to process data across the change.

2  Terminology 
    
   Terms used in this document are defined in the Terminology 
   section of the IPFIX Protocol [RFC5101] and are to be 
   interpreted as defined there. 
    
    

3  Method 
    
   An Exporting Process informs a Collecting Process of the 
   equivalence of a pair of IPFIX Information Elements by exporting 
   an IPFIX Equivalence Message. Equivalence Messages SHOULD be 
   sent by the Exporting Process upon opening a new Transport 
   Session, before any other IPFIX Messages are exported. They may 
   be sent in an Options Record Scoped to the Exporter. Multiple 
   Equivalence Messages may be sent using IPFIX Structured Data 
   [RFC6313]. 
    

3.1 Equivalence Message Format 
    
   The Equivalence Message consists of an original Information 
   Element in the "informationElementId" field (#303), followed by 
   the equivalent Information Element in the "equivalentElementId" 
   field (#TBD), using the Template shown in Figure 1 and Data 
   Record shown in Figure 2: 
    
    
          0                   1                   2                   3   
         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
        |E|  informationElementId #303  |        Field Length           | 
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
        |E|  equivalentElementId #TBD   |        Field Length           | 
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
                                  
             Figure 1: Template for Equivalence Message 
                                  
                                  
                 --+-+---------------+-+---------------+-- 
               ... |E|  Original IE  |E| Equivalent IE | ... 
                 --+-+---------------+-+---------------+-- 
                                  
              Figure 2: Equivalence Message Data Record 
    
    
   The encoding of these Information Elements follows the rules 
   specified in [RFC5101]. 
    
   When the original Information Element and the equivalent 
   Information Element are both IANA standard elements 
   [IANA-IPFIX], both of the E bits are zero and the Equivalence 
   Message is as shown in Figure 1. 
    
   When the Original Information Element is Enterprise-Specific,

   the Original Information Element's E bit is set and the 
   Information Element number is immediately followed by the 
   corresponding Private Enterprise Number [PEN], as shown in 
   Figure 3: 
    
    
     +-+---------------+----------------------------------+-+---------------+ 
     |1|  Original IE  |    Private Enterprise Number     |0| Equivalent IE | 
     +-+---------------+----------------------------------+-+---------------+ 
                                  
      Figure 3: Equivalence Message with an Enterprise-Specific 
                    Original Information Element 
    
    
   This allows an Enterprise-Specific Information Element to be 
   specified as equivalent to an IANA-standard Information Element. 
    
   When the Equivalent Information Element is Enterprise-Specific, 
   the Equivalent Information Element's E bit is set and the 
   Information Element number is immediately followed by the 
   corresponding Private Enterprise Number [PEN] as shown in 
   Figure 4: 
    
    
     +-+---------------+-+---------------+----------------------------------+ 
     |0|  Original IE  |1| Equivalent IE |    Private Enterprise Number     | 
     +-+---------------+-+---------------+----------------------------------+ 
                                  
      Figure 4: Equivalence Message with an Enterprise Specific 
                   Equivalent Information Element 
    
    
   This allows an IANA-standard Information Element to be specified 
   as equivalent to an Enterprise-Specific Information Element. 
    
   When both of the Information Elements are Enterprise-Specific, 
   the E bits are set and both Information Element numbers are 
   immediately followed by their corresponding Private Enterprise 
   Number [PEN] as shown in Figure 5: 
    
    
            +-+---------------+----------------------------------+     
             |1|  Original IE  |    Private Enterprise Number     | ... 
            +-+---------------+----------------------------------+     
              +-+---------------+----------------------------------+ 
          ... |1| Equivalent IE |    Private Enterprise Number     | 
              +-+---------------+----------------------------------+ 
                                  
      Figure 5: Equivalence Message with two Enterprise-Specific 
                        Information Elements 
    
    
   This allows two Enterprise-Specific Information Elements to be 
   specified as equivalent. 
    
   Note that the Private Enterprise Numbers do not have to be 
   equal. ie, the Information Elements may belong to different 
   Private Enterprises.

4  The Collecting Process's Side 
    
   Equivalence Messages have global scope, unless they're sent in 
   an Options Message with a more restrictive scope, eg an Options 
   Record Scoped to the Exporter. ie, unless otherwise restricted, 
   the specified equivalence applies to all devices. 
    
   Therefore the Collecting Process does not need to maintain 
   equivalence per device. 
    

5  Security Considerations 
    
   The same security considerations apply as for the IPFIX Protocol 
   [RFC5101]. 
    

6          IANA Considerations 
    
   A new Information Element "equivalentElementId" must be 
   allocated in  IANA's IPFIX registry, [IANA-IPFIX]:  
    
   Description: An IPFIX Information Element 
   ("equivalentElementId") that denotes an Information Element 
   identifier which is equivalent to another Information Element 
   identifier, specified in an IPFIX Equivalence Message [this 
   document]. 
    
   Abstract Data Type: Unsigned16 
    
   Data Type Semantics: identifier  
    
   ElementId: TBD
