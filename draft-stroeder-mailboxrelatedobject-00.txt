Internet-Draft        LDAP Mailbox Related Objects         December 2012


1.  Introduction

   Often there is a need to add attribute 'mail' defined in [RFC4524] to
   directory entries to associate a, most times non-personal, RFC 2822
   mail address with an arbitrary object.

   This document defines the auxiliary object class
   'mailboxRelatedObject' for that purpose so abusing person object
   classes like 'inetOrgPerson' defined in [RFC2798] for non-personal
   mail addresses is not needed.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document is being discussed on the ldapext@ietf.org mailing
   list.


2.  Object Class Definition

   Entries of auxiliary object class 'mailboxRelatedObject' MUST contain
   attribute 'mail' defined in [RFC4524] as required attribute and MAY
   contain attribute 'displayName' defined in [RFC2798].

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.5427.1.389.6.9
     NAME 'mailboxRelatedObject'
     DESC 'Associated RFC 2822 mailbox for any entry'
     AUXILIARY
     MUST ( mail )
     MAY ( displayName ) )


3.  IANA Considerations

   The OID arc used for the object class defintion is:
   iso(1) org(3) dod(6) internet(1) private(4) enter-prise(1)
   stroeder.com(5427) public(1) ldap(389) objectClasses(6)


4.  Security Considerations

   The introduction of these object classes does not impact the security
   of the Internet or a particular LDAP directory service.

   Security considerations for LDAP in general are discussed in
   documents comprising the technical specification [RFC4510].
