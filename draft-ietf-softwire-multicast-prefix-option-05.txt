1.  Introduction

   Several solutions (e.g., [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast]) are
   proposed for the delivery of multicast services in the context of
   transition to IPv6.  Even if these solutions may have different
   applicable use cases, they all use specific IPv6 addresses to embed
   IPv4 addresses, for both multicast group, and multicast source
   addresses.

   This document defines a DHCPv6 option [RFC3315] to convey the IPv6
   prefixes to be used for constructing these IPv4-embedded IPv6
   addresses.

   This option can be in particular used in the context of DS-Lite
   [RFC6333], Stateless A+P [RFC6346] and other IPv4-IPv6 transition
   techniques.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

Internet-Draft     IPv4/IPv6 Multicast Prefixes Option      October 2013


   o  IPv4-embedded IPv6 address: is an IPv6 address which embeds a 32
      bit-encoded IPv4 address [RFC6052].  An IPv4-embedded IPv6 address
      can be a unicast or a multicast address.
   o  PREFIX64: is an IPv6 prefix used for synthesizing IPv4-embedded
      IPv6 addresses.  A PREFIX64 can be of unicast or multicast.

         Note: "64" is used as an abbreviation for IPv6-IPv4
         interconnection.
   o  ASM_PREFIX64: is a multicast PREFIX64 which belongs to the Any-
      Source Multicast (ASM) range.
   o  SSM_PREFIX64: is a multicast PREFIX64 which belongs to the Source-
      Specific Multicast (SSM, [RFC4607]) range.
   o  U_PREFIX64: is a unicast PREFIX64 for building the IPv4-embedded
      IPv6 addresses of multicast sources in SSM mode.

3.  PREFIX64 DHCPv6 Option

   OPTION_PREFIX64 (Figure 1) conveys the IPv6 prefix(es) to be used
   (e.g., by a mB4 [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast]) to synthesize
   IPv4-embbedded IPv6 addresses.

                Figure 1: DHCPv6 Option Format for PREFIX64

   The fields of the option shown in Figure 1 are as follows:

   option-code:  OPTION_PREFIX64 (see Section 8).
   option-length:  length of the PREFIX64 option.
   asm-length:  the prefix-length for the ASM IPv4-embedded prefix, as
      an 8-bit unsigned integer (0 to 128).  This field represents the
      number of valid leading bits in the prefix.

Internet-Draft     IPv4/IPv6 Multicast Prefixes Option      October 2013


   ASM_PREFIX64:  this field identifies the IPv6 multicast prefix to be
      used to synthesize the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses of the
      multicast groups in the ASM mode.  It is a variable size field
      with the length of the field defined by the asm-length field and
      is rounded up to the nearest octet boundary.  In such case any
      additional padding bits must be zeroed.  The conveyed multicast
      IPv6 prefix MUST belong to the ASM range.  This prefix is likely
      to be a /96.
   ssm-length:  the prefix-length for the SSM IPv4-embedded prefix, as
      an 8-bit unsigned integer (0 to 128).  This field represents the
      number of valid leading bits in the prefix.
   SSM_PREFIX64:  this field identifies the IPv6 multicast prefix to be
      used to synthesize the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses of the
      multicast groups in the SSM mode.  It is a variable size field
      with the length of the field defined by the ssm-length field and
      is rounded up to the nearest octet boundary.  In such case any
      additional padding bits must be zeroed.  The conveyed multicast
      IPv6 prefix MUST belong to the SSM range.  This prefix is likely
      to be a /96.
   unicast-length:  the prefix-length for the IPv6 unicast prefix to be
      used to synthesize the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses of the
      multicast sources, as an 8-bit unsigned integer (0 to 128).  This
      field represents the number of valid leading bits in the prefix.
   U_PREFIX64:  this field identifies the IPv6 unicast prefix to be used
      in SSM mode for constructing the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses
      representing the IPv4 multicast sources in the IPv6 domain.
      U_PREFIX64 may also be used to extract the IPv4 address from the
      received multicast data flows.  It is a variable size field with
      the length of the field defined by the unicast-length field and is
      rounded up to the nearest octet boundary.  In such case any
      additional padding bits must be zeroed.  The address mapping MUST
      follow the guidelines documented in [RFC6052].

4.  Configuration Guidelines (Server Side)

   DHCP servers supporting OPTION_PREFIX64 should be configured with
   U_PREFIX64 and at least one ASM_PREFIX64 or one SSM_PREFIX64.

   When ASM_PREFIX64 and SSM_PREFIX64 are configured, the length of
   these prefixes must be /96.

   Both ASM_PREFIX64 and SSM_PREFIX64 may be configured and therefore be
   returned to a requesting DHCP client; it is deployment-specific.  In
   particular, if both SSM and ASM modes are supported, ASM_PREFIX64 and
   SSM_PREFIX64 prefixes must be configured.  For SSM deployments, both
   SSM_PREFIX64 and U_PREFIX64 should be configured.

5.  DHCPv6 Client Behaviour

   To retrieve the IPv6 prefixes that will be used to synthesize unicast
   and multicast IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses, the DHCPv6 client MUST
   include OPTION_PREFIX64 in its OPTION_ORO.  If the DHCPv6 client
   receives more than one OPTION_PREFIX64 option from the DHCPv6 server:

   o  If all the enclosed IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast prefixes have the
      same scope, the first instance of the option MUST be used.
   o  If each enclosed IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast prefix has a
      distinct scope, the client MUST select the appropriate
      IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast prefix having a scope matching the
      IPv4 multicast address used to synthesize an IPv4-embedded IPv6
      multicast address.

   If asm-length, ssm-length and unicast-length fields are all set to 0,
   the DHCPv6 client MUST behave as if OPTION_PREFIX64 had not been
   received in the response received from the DHCPv6 server.

   If the asm-length field is non-null, the IPv6 prefix identified by
   ASM_PREFIX64 is used to synthesize IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast
   addresses in the ASM range.  This is achieved by concatenating the
   ASM_PREFIX64 and the IPv4 multicast address; the Pv4 multicast
   address is inserted in the last 32 bits of the IPv4-embedded IPv6
   multicast address.

   If the ssm-length field is non-null, the IPv6 prefix identified by
   SSM_PREFIX64 is used to synthesize IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast
   addresses in the SSM range.  This is achieved by concatenating the
   SSM_PREFIX64 and the IPv4 multicast address; the Pv4 multicast
   address is inserted in the last 32 bits of the IPv4-embedded IPv6
   multicast address.

   If the unicast-length field is non-null, the IPv6 prefix identified
   by U_PREFIX64 field is used to synthesize IPv4-embedded IPv6 unicast
   addresses as specified in [RFC6052].

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations documented in [RFC3315] and [RFC6052] are
   to be considered.
