        The RTP Monitoring Architectures <xref target="RFC6792"/> provides

      <section title="Applicability">
        <t>Real-time applications employ a jitter buffer to absorb jitter
        introduced on the path from source to destination. These metrics are
        used to report how the jitter buffer at the receiving end of RTP
        stream behaves as a result of jitter in the network and are applicable
        to a range of RTP applications.</t>

        <t>These metrics reflect how terminal-related factors affect real-time
        application quality and are useful to provide better end-user quality
        of experience (QoE).</t>

    <section title="Jitter Buffer Operation">
      <t>A jitter buffer is required to absorb delay variation in network
      delivery of media packets. A jitter buffer works by holding media data
      for a period of time after it is received and before it is played out.
      Packets that arrive early are held in the jitter buffer longer. If
      packets arrive too early they may be discarded if there is no available
      jitter buffer space. If packets are delayed excessively by the network
      they may be discarded if they miss their playout time. </t>

      <t>Overall user perceived delay = network round trip delay + local
      (jitter buffer (nominal) delay + encoder serialization delay) + remote
      (jitter buffer (nominal) delay + encoder serialization delay) </t>

      <t>The jitter buffer can be considered as a time window with early edge
      aligned with the delay corresponding to the earliest arriving packet and
      late edge representing the maximum permissible delay before a late
      arriving packet would be discarded. The delay applied to packets that
      arrive at their expected time is known as the Nominal Delay and this is
      equivalent to the late edge. </t>

      <t>The reference for the expected arrival time may, for example, be the
      first packet in the session or the running average delay. If all packets
      arrived at their expected arrival time then then every packet would be
      held in the jitter buffer exactly the Nominal Delay. </t>

      <t>The Jitter Buffer maximum delay is the delay that is applied to an
      earliest arriving packet that is not discarded and corresponds to the
      early edge of the jitter buffer time window. </t>

      <section title="Idealized Jitter Buffer">
        <t>In practice jitter buffer implementations vary considerably however
        should behave in a manner conceptually consistent with an idealized
        jitter buffer described as follows:<list>
            <t>(i). Receive the first packet and delay playout by D ms. Keep
            the RTP timestamp and receive time as a reference.<vspace
            blankLines="1"/>RTP TS[1]<vspace blankLines="1"/>receive
            time[1]<vspace blankLines="1"/>Assume that both are normalized in
            ticks.</t>

            <t>(ii). Receive the next packet</t>

            <t>(iii). Calculate r = RTP TS[n] - RTP TS[1] and t = receive
            time[n] - receive time[1]. If r = t then the packet arrived on
            time. If r &lt; t then the packet arrived late and if r &gt; t
            then the packet arrived early. </t>

            <t>(iv). Delay playout of packet by D + (r -t)</t>

            <t> (v). Go back to (ii)</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Note that this idealized implementation assumes that the sender's
        RTP clock is synchronized to the clock in the receiver which is used
        to timestamp packet arrivals. If there is no such inherent
        synchronization, the system may need to use an adaptive jitter buffer
        or other techniques to ensure reliable reception.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Fixed Jitter Buffer">
        <t>The fixed jitter buffers have a fixed size and the packets leaving
        the jitter buffer have a constant delay.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Adaptive Jitter Buffer">
        <t>An adaptive jitter buffer have variable size and variable delay. It
        allows the nominal delay to be set to a low value initially, to
        minimize user perceived delay, however can automatically extend the
        late edge (and possibly also retract the early edge) of buffer window
        if a significant proportion of packets are arriving late (and hence
        being discarded). </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Jitter Buffer Metrics Block">
      <t>This block describes the configuration and operating parameters of
      the jitter buffer in the receiver of the RTP end system or RTP mixer
      which sends the report. Instances of this Metrics Block refer by SSRC to
      the separate auxiliary Measurement Information block <xref
      target="RFC6776"/> which describes the measurement interval in use. This
      Metrics Block relies on the measurement interval in the Measurement
      Information block indicating the span of the report and should be sent
      in the same compound RTCP packet as the measurement information block.
      If the measurement interval is not received in the same compound RTCP
      packet as this Metrics Block, this Metrics Block should be
      discarded.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>This document defines the Extended Report (XR) packet type for
            the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), and defines how the use of XR
            packets can be signaled by an application if it employs the
            Session Description Protocol (SDP). XR packets are composed of
            report blocks, and seven block types are defined here. The purpose
            of the extended reporting format is to convey information that
            supplements the six statistics that are contained in the report
            blocks used by RTCP's Sender Report (SR) and Receiver Report (RR)
            packets. Some applications, such as multicast inference of network
            characteristics (MINC) or voice over IP (VoIP) monitoring, require
            other and more detailed statistics. In addition to the block types
            defined here, additional block types may be defined in the future
            by adhering to the framework that this document provides.</t>
