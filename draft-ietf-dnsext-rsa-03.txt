This document describes how to produce RSA/SHA1 SIG resource records
(RRs) in Section 3 and, so as to completely replace RFC 2537,
describes how to produce RSA KEY RRs in Section 2.
 
Since the adoption of a Proposed Standard for RSA signatures in the
DNS (Domain Name Space), advances in hashing have been made.  A new
DNS signature algorithm is defined to make these advances available in
SIG RRs.  The use of the previously specified weaker mechanism is
deprecated.  The algorithm number of the RSA KEY RR is changed to
correspond to this new SIG algorithm.  No other changes are made to
DNS security.

This document is a product of the DNS Extensions Working Group of the
IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.

This announcement is sent to the IETF list and the RFC-DIST list.
Requests to be added to or deleted from the IETF distribution list
