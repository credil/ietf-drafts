                    Service Distribution using OSPF
           draft-pillay-esnault-ospf-service-distribution-01

Abstract

   The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol is used to carry data on
   behalf of other services using the Opaque Link State Advertisements.
   The protocol's flooding mechanism is well suited to cover the data
   propagation requirements of services such as Traffic Engineering.
   The current mechanism cannot scale for a large number of services nor
   satisfy some of their new set of requirements.  This document
   describes a new mechanism in OSPF to support service and data
   distribution for a large number of services, computation of preferred
   service access points and a controlled service data exchange.

Internet-Draft       Service Distribution using OSPF        October 2012


1.  Introduction

   Originally, routing protocols were designed to propagate routing
   related information only.  With the advent of Traffic Engineering,
   the IGPs started to be used as a transport mechanism.  Most of the
   applications using IGPs as transport are still very much limited and
   confined to routing applications with similar requirements.

   Today, OSPF can carry data for applications using Opaque LSAs.  These
   Opaque LSAs are an integral part of the OSPF database and will be
   flooded, synchronized and updated just as any other LSA.  However,
   they do not contribute directly to any routes or trigger an SPF.

   Opaque LSAs will need to be flooded across all the OSPF area or
   domain and neighbor adjacencies to FULL state will depend on
   successful exchange of these LSAs.

   The Link State IGPs are limited on the size of payload information
   they can carry as it will be flooded and stored in every single
   router all across their areas or domain regardless whether it is of
   interest or not.

   This document describes a new mechanism in OSPF to support service
   and data distribution for a large number of services, computation of
   preferred service access points and controlled distribution of
   service data.

   We presuppose familiarity with the contents of [RFC4970], [RFC5250],
   [RFC2328] and [RFC5340] .

2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Requirements for service data propagation

   Services requirements differ from the traditional routing information
   dissemination model.  The service data may be unrelated to routing or
   be of interest only to some routers.  The new set of requirements for
   using OSPF as Service Distribution Router (SDR) is as follows

      Scale to a large number of services

      No assumption regarding size, format or nature of the data

      No assumption regarding topology

      Routing and service data separated and independent

      Must support cases where minimal number of routers only may be
      upgraded

      Must support dynamic events

      Routers only store and process data of interest

      Ability to compute the shortest path to a producer or consumer of
      a service per IGP metrics or service metrics.

      There is no assumptions regarding producers and consumers of
      services, their location or uniqueness.

      Secured data may reside only on some routers.

   In addition the routing requirements for OSPF as Service data
   distribution are

      Backward compatible with Open Standard OSPF

      Minimal/No impact on routing convergence and performance

4.  Typical Scenario for Services Distribution Router

   A SDR is typically reachable by multiple consumers or producers of
   data.  The router itself may not be connected directly to any other
   router with Service Distribution Capability.  The intermediate
   routers may have limited storage capability or cannot store the data
   for security reasons.

   The SDR is aware of the topological information of the other service
   routers and can compute paths to the preferred Producer SDR (PSDR) or
   the Consumers SDR (CSDR) of a service.The SDR will implement tables
   of producers and consumers for services.

   The SDR ensures that interested subscribers to a service are notified
   with the latest updates.

   Producers or consumers can join or leave a service at any time using
   APIs.  The SDR receiving the notification of "registration" or "de-
   registration" flood the change of state to all the known SDRs in its
   topology.  Therefore, all SDR have the same view of the producers/
   consumers topology.

5.  OSPF Service Distribution Router

   A SDR leverages OSPF's capability to store and flood the topology and
   other attributes of SDR capable routers.  SDRs form an overlay and do
   not require to be directly connected to each other.  SDRs do not need
   to maintain adjacency between them other than the normal OSPF
   adjacency for routing purposes.  The SDRs rely on the OSPF underlying
   network for reachability to other SDR routers.

   SDRs advertise a directory of producers and consumers of services and
   are capable to compute preferred producers.  The SDRs delegate data
   exchange processing to remote SDRs to an external agent.  This agent
   is described in detail in section 9 of this document.

   The OSPF Opaque LSAs is used to carry relevant and interesting
   information for reachability and nature of SDR capable routers.

   In order to limit the service data dissemination costs (storage,
   bandwidth, security, ..), SDRs may store only data of interest.

              Service Distribution Router


                   The OSPF Service Distribution Router

   The following sections describe the extensions in OSPF protocol to
   support this capability.

6.  Storage Of Service Data

   The service data can be stored in an independent Service Data
   Database(SDD).  There is no assumption made here on the size, format
   or nature of data.  The data can even be stored on the disk of the
   router and accessible by APIs to OSPF and other applications for

   query and update.  A SDD is not part of OSPF and does not participate
   in the bringing up of adjacencies.

   It is desirable that the service data database have a very flexible
   format to cater for a broad range of applications.  A possible
   solution is that the database records be defined as container objects
   which themselves contain service metadata.

7.  Mechanics of the OSPF Service Information Distribution
    Implementation

7.1.  Advertising and Signaling of SDR Capability

   The OSPF SDR router will identify itself to the rest of the domain by
   advertising its capability and a routable ip address.  For example,
   this address MAY be a loopback interface configured to uniquely
   identify an OSPF SDR router.  A new bit for SDR capability is
   reserved in the Router Information Capabilities TLV of the Router
   Information LSA, as defined in section 2.1 of [RFC4970].

   Set to 0 if there is no producer for the service.

   The topological view and characteristics of the OSPF Overlay Service
   Distribution Routers can be used to compute preferred producer
   independent of IGP metrics.  It is possible to have multiple LSAs for
   large directories however a service must be described in a unique
   sub-tlv for the SDR.

7.4.  Service Routing Capable Router Operations

   The additional requirements are

      No assumption on topology

      Multiple producers may exists

      Multiple consumers can all have different service interest

      Producers/Consumers may join and leave at anytime

      Consumers and Producers have access to the Service Data database

   The SDR capable routers advertise the consumers who subscribe to a

   service.  The producers may connect to the SDR router to update the
   services/data in the Service Data database.  The SDR router then
   builds the Opaque LSA describing the producer services which are
   reachable through it as well as the services its consumers are
   interested in.

   When the router has a full neighbor relationship, it now has the
   topological view of all SDR capable routers in the domain as well as
   the services they offer and are interested in.

   Leveraging the fact that the OSPF has already run its SPF, the
   reachability of overlay SDR capable routers and services offered.  It
   is possible to calculate the preferred Producer SDR for a service by
   using a composite of the IGP metric, the SDR metric and the service
   metric.  The list of preferred producers for a service can then be
   evaluated at each SDR.

   The list of Consumer SDRs interested in service can also easily be
   computed from the directory of consumers.

7.4.1.  Operation due to Producer changes

   The producer service operations are

      New producer advertises a service

      Existing Producer start advertising a new service

      Existing Producer stops advertising a service.

   The router will be notified by the application regarding the new
   producer and the services offered.  The router will then either
   update or create an Opaque LSA to advertise this new information and
   flood it to all SR routers.

   Upon receiving this information, remote SDR routers can recalculate
   the preferred PSDR.  It may also need to perform some operations if
   it have consumers for this new service.

7.4.2.  Operation due to Consumer changes

   The consumer service operations are

      A new consumer join and add subscription

      An existing consumer stops subscriptions

Internet-Draft       Service Distribution using OSPF        October 2012


      An existing consumer adds subscriptions

   The router will be notified by the application regarding the new
   consumer and the services it is interested in.  The router will then
   either update or create an Opaque LSA to advertise this new
   information and flood it to all SDR routers.

   Upon receipt of the new Opaque LSA the remote SDR routers can then
   update the list of CSDRs interested in their services per latest
   information.

8.  Calculation of Optimal Producer

   Leveraging OSPF capability to store and compute paths on a topology,
   the same mechanisms can be used to compute the Optimal PSDRs using
   the SPF for SDR reachable address using IGP metrics, SDR metric and
   the service metric.  The Optimal PSDR is used in the consumer subtlv.

9.  Service Router Data Operations

   OSPF SDR delegates the task of SDD distribution to the Data Exchange
   Agent.  This text defines an implementation of such an agent and
   named it the Service Data Distribution Agent (SDDA).  OSPF SDR
   provides SDDA information about which Consumer SDR is interested
   which service provided by this OSPF (Producer) SDR.  The SDDA makes
   use of such information to setup distribution channel for SDD
   distribution from this OSPF Producer SDR to other OSPF Consumer SDRs.

   For each OSPF Consumer SDR which subscribes to at least one service
   provided by this OSPF Producer SDR, there will be a different
   distribution channel created.

   The distribution channel is setup when the OSPF Consumer SDR has
   subscribed to its first service provided by this OSPF Producer SDR.
   When the OSPF Consumer SDR subscribes to additional service provided
   by this OSPF Producer SDR, service data for the new service will be
   carried over the existing distribution channel.  In order words, the
   same distribution channel can carry service data for different
   services.  The services carried are said to be bound to the
   distribution channel.

   When a distribution channel is first setup for a service or a new
   service is bound to the channel, the SDDA will notify the SDD.  In
   turn, the SDD will send the latest data for that service to the SDDA
   for distribution over that channel.

   On the other hand, whenever the SDD has new version of data for a
   service, the SDD will send those data to the SDDA, which will

Internet-Draft       Service Distribution using OSPF        October 2012


   distribute the new data to all the distribution channels which carry
   the service.

9.1.  Implementation of SDDA

   The SDDA can be implemented in many ways and beyond the scope of this
   document.  For example, the SDDA can use BGP capability to transport
   service data as described in [BGPSERV] as its transport protocol for
   service data distribution.
