Internet-Draft                RTCP XR Delay                  August 2012


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Packet Delay Metrics Block

   This draft defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611] for use in a range of RTP applications.  The new block type
   supports the reporting of the mean, minimum and maximum values of the
   network round-trip delay between RTP interfaces in peer RTP end
   systems as measured, for example, using the RTCP method described in
   [RFC3550].  It also supports reporting of the component of the round-
   trip delay internal to the local RTP system.

   The network metrics belong to the class of packet transport delay
   metrics defined in [MONARCH].

1.2.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]
   defined an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This draft defines a new Extended Report block that
   MUST be used as defined in [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].

1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework

   The Performance Metrics Framework [RFC6390] provides guidance on the
   definition and specification of performance metrics.  The RTP
   Monitoring Architectures [MONARCH] provides guideline for reporting
   block format using RTCP XR.  The Metrics Block described in this
   document are in accordance with the guidelines in [RFC6390] and
   [MONARCH].

1.4.  Applicability

   These metrics are applicable to a range of RTP applications in which
   this report block would be useful, such as multimedia conferencing
   and streaming audio and video.  Knowledge of the round-trip delay and
   delay characteristics can aid other receivers in sizing their receive
   buffers and selecting a playout delay.  The same information is also
   valuable to network managers in troubleshooting network and user
   experience issues.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Delay Block

   Metrics in this block report on packet delay in the stream arriving
   at the RTP system.  Instances of this Metrics Block refer by
   Synchronization source (SSRC) to the separate auxiliary Measurement
   Information block [MEASI] which contains measurement intervals.  This
   metric block relies on the measurement interval in the Measurement
   Information block indicating the span of the report and SHOULD be
   sent in the same compound RTCP packet as the measurement information
   block.  If the measurement interval is not received in the same
   compound RTCP packet as this metric block, this metric block SHOULD
   be discarded.

3.2.  Definition of Fields in Delay Metrics Report Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      A Delay Report Block is identified by the constant NDEL.

      [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NDEL with the IANA provided
      RTCP XR block type for this block.]

Internet-Draft                RTCP XR Delay                  August 2012


   Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bit

      This field is used to indicate whether the Delay metrics are
      Sampled, Interval or Cumulative metrics, that is, whether the
      reported values applies to the most recent measurement interval
      duration between successive metrics reports (I=10) (the Interval
      Duration) or to the accumulation period characteristic of
      cumulative measurements (I=11) (the Cumulative Duration) or is a
      sampled instantaneous value (I=01) (Sampled Value).


   Reserved (resv): 6 bits

      These bits are reserved.  They MUST be set to zero by senders and
      SHOULD be ignored by receivers.


   block length: 16 bits

      The length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one.  For
      the Delay block, the block length is equal to 6.


   SSRC of source: 32 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3611].


   Mean Network Round Trip Delay: 32 bits

      The Mean Network Round Trip Delay is the mean value of the RTP-to-
      RTP interface round trip delay over the measurement period,
      expressed in units of 1/65536 seconds.  This value is typically
      determined using RTCP SR/RR (See RFC 3550 section 6.4.1).

      If only one measurement of Round Trip Delay is available for the
      timespan of the report (i.e.,the measurement period) (whether
      Interval or Cumulative), this single value SHOULD be reported as
      the mean value.

      If the measurement is unavailable, the value of this field with
      all bits set to 1 MUST be reported.


   Min Network Round Trip Delay: 32 bits

      The Min Network Round Trip Delay is the minimum value of the RTP-
      to-RTP interface round trip delay over the measurement period,



Clark, et al.             Expires March 3, 2013                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                RTCP XR Delay                  August 2012


      expressed in units of 1/65536 seconds.  This value is typically
      determined using RTCP SR/RR.

      If only one measurement of Round Trip Delay is available for the
      timespan of the report (i.e.,the measurement period) (whether
      Interval or Cumulative), this single value SHOULD be reported as
      the minimum value.

      If the measurement is unavailable, the value of this field with
      all bits set to 1 MUST be reported.

   Max Network Round Trip Delay: 32 bits

      The Max Network Round Trip Delay is the maximum value of the RTP-
      to-RTP interface round trip delay over the measurement period,
      expressed in units of 1/65536 seconds.  This value is typically
      determined using RTCP SR/RR.

      If only one measurement of Round Trip Delay is available for the
      timespan of the report (i.e.,the measurement period) (whether
      Interval or Cumulative), this single value SHOULD be reported as
      the maximum value.

      If the measurement is unavailable, the value of this field with
      all bits set to 1 MUST be reported.


   End System Delay: 64 bits

      The End System Delay is the internal round trip delay within the
      reporting endpoint, calculated using the nominal value of the
      jitter buffer delay plus the accumulation/encoding and decoding/
      playout delay associated with the codec being used.  The value of
      this field is represented using a 64-bit NTP-format timestamp as
      defined in [RFC5905], which is 64-bit unsigned fixed-point number
      with the integer part in the first 32 bits and the fractional part
      in the last 32 bits.

      If the measurement is unavailable, the value of this field with
      all bits set to 1 MUST be reported.

4.  SDP Signaling

   [RFC3611] defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol)
   [RFC4566] for signaling the use of XR blocks.  XR blocks MAY be used
   without prior signaling.

   This section augments the SDP [RFC4566] attribute "rtcp-xr" defined
   in [RFC3611] by providing an additional value of "xr-format" to
   signal the use of the report block defined in this document.

   rtcp-xr-attrib = "a=" "rtcp-xr" ":" [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF

   (defined in [RFC3611])

   xr-format =/ xr-delay-block

   xr-delay-block ="delay"

5.  IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.  For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to
   [RFC3611].

5.1.  New RTCP XR Block Type value

   This document assigns the block type value NDEL in the IANA "RTCP XR
   Block Type Registry" to the "Delay Metrics Block".

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NDEL with the IANA provided RTCP
   XR block type for this block.]

5.2.  New RTCP XR SDP Parameter

   This document also registers a new parameter "delay" in the "RTCP XR
   SDP Parameters Registry".

5.3.  Contact information for registrations


      The contact information for the registrations is:

      Qin Wu (sunseawq@huawei.com)

6.  Security Considerations

   It is believed that this proposed RTCP XR report block introduces no
   new security considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611].
   This block does not provide per-packet statistics so the risk to
   confidentiality documented in Section 7, paragraph 3 of [RFC3611]
   does not apply.
