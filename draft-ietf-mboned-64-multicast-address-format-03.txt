Internet-Draft         64 Multicast Address Format           August 2012


1.  Introduction

   Various solutions (e.g., [I-D.ietf-softwire-mesh-multicast],
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast]) have been proposed to allow
   access to IPv4 multicast content from hosts attached to IPv6-enabled
   domains.  Even if these solutions have distinct applicability scopes
   (translation vs. encapsulation) and target different use cases, they
   all make use of specific IPv6 multicast addresses to embed an IPv4
   multicast address.  Particularly, the IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast
   address is used as a destination IPv6 address of multicast flows
   received from an IPv4-enabled domain and injected by the IPv4-IPv6
   Interconnection Function into an IPv6-enabled domain.  It is also
   used to build an IPv6 multicast state (*, G6) or (S6, G6)
   corresponding to their (*, G4) or (S4, G4) IPv4 counter parts by the
   IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection Function.  [I-D.ietf-mboned-v4v6-mcast-ps]
   provides more discussion about issues related to IPv4/IPv6 multicast.

   This document reserves two prefixes to be used to synthesize IPv4-
   embedded IPv6 multicast address.  This document also defines how
   IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast addresses are constructed.  Both IPv4-
   IPv6 translation or encapsulation schemes can make use of these
   prefixes.

   Appendix A.1 enumerates the arguments in favor of reserving dedicated
   prefixes Appendix A.2 discusses why identifying an IPv4-embedded IPv6
   multicast address is needed.

   This specification can be used in conjunction with other extensions
   such as building unicast prefix-based multicast IPv6 address
   [RFC3306] or embedding the rendezvous point [RFC3956].  These
   techniques are important tools to simplify IPv6 multicast
   deployments.  Indeed, unicast prefix-based IPv6 addressing is used in
   many current IPv6 multicast deployments, and has also been defined
   for IPv4, and is seen as a very useful technique.  Also embedded-RP
   is used in existing deployments.

   This document is a companion document to [RFC6052] which focuses
   exclusively on IPv4-embedded IPv6 unicast addresses.


2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   o  IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address: denotes a multicast IPv6
      address which includes in 32 bits an IPv4 address.

Internet-Draft         64 Multicast Address Format           August 2012


   o  Multicast Prefix64 (or MPREFIX64 for short) refers to an IPv6
      multicast prefix to be used to construct IPv4-embedded IPv6
      multicast addresses.  This prefix is used to build an IPv4-
      embedded IPv6 multicast address as defined in Section 3.3.
      Section 3.3 specifies also how to extract an IPv4 address from an
      IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address.

   o  ASM_MPREFIX64: denotes a multicast Prefix64 used in Any Source
      Multicast (ASM) mode.

   o  SSM_MPREFIX64: denotes a multicast Prefix64 used in Source
      Specific Multicast (SSM) mode.

   o  IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection Function: refers to a function which is
      enabled in a node interconnecting an IPv4-enabled domain with an
      IPv6-enabled one.  It can be located in various places of the
      multicast network.  Particularly, in terms of multicast control
      messages, it can be an IGMP/MLD Interworking Function or an IPv4-
      IPv6 PIM Interworking Function.  An IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection
      Function is configured with one or two MPREFIX64s.


3.  IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Multicast Prefix & Address

3.1.  Reserving Dedicated Prefixes

   The following constraints should be met when reserving dedicated
   prefix(es) to be used for IPv4/IPv6 multicast interconnection:

   1:  Belong to ff3x::/32 and be compatible with unicast-based prefix
       [RFC3306] for SSM.  Note that [RFC3306] suggests to set "plen" to
       0 and "network-prefix" to 0.  As such, any prefix in the 33-96
       range can be convenient.  Given [RFC4607] indicates future
       specifications may allow a non-zero network prefix field, a /33
       would allow for future extensions but it has the drawback of
       reserving a large block.  A /96 would be adequate for the use
       cases already identified in [I-D.ietf-mboned-v4v6-mcast-ps].  In
       the event of any concrete extension, reserving additional
       prefixes may be considered.

   2:  Be compatible with embedded-RP [RFC3956] and unicast-based prefix
       [RFC3306] for ASM.  This results in a prefix length to be in the
       17-20 range.  A /17 has the advantage of allowing for future
       extensions but it may be seen as a waste of the multicast address
       space.  Consequently, a /20 is preferred.

   3:  Avoid ff3x::4000:0001-ff3x::7fff:ffff which is reserved for IANA.

   Meeting (1) and (2) with the same prefix is not feasible without
   modifying embedded-RP and unicast-based prefix specifications; this
   option is avoided.

   As a consequence, two multicast prefixes are proposed to be used when
   embedding IPv4 address: one prefix for ASM and another one for the
   SSM.  This document reserves the following multicast prefixes to be
   used in the context of IPv4/IPv6 multicast interconnection:

   o  ff3x:0:8000::/96 SSM range to embed an IPv4 multicast address in
      the last 32 bits.

   o  ffxx:8000::/20 ASM range to embed an IPv4 multicast address in the
      last 32 bits.

3.2.  IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Multicast Address

   For the delivery of the IPv4-IPv6 multicast interconnection services,
   a dedicated multicast prefix denoted as MPREFIX64 should be
   provisioned (e.g., using NETCONF or
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-multicast-prefix-option]) to any function
   requiring to build an IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address based on
   an IPv4 multicast address.  MPREFIX64 can be of ASM or SSM type.
   When both modes are used, two prefixes are required to be
   provisioned.

   The length of MPREFIX64 MUST be /96.  MPREFIX64 should belong to
   ffxx:8000::/20 for ASM mode and ff3x:0:8000::/96 for the SSM mode.

   For the ASM mode, the format of the MPREFIX64 should follow what is
   specified in [RFC3306] and [RFC3956] if corresponding mechanisms are
   used.  If not, bits 21-96 can be set to any value.

   Figure 1 shows how to build an IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address
   using a configured MPREFIX64 and an IPv4 multicast address.  The low-
   order 32 bits MUST include an IPv4 multicast address.  The enclosed
   IPv4 multicast address SHOULD NOT be in 232/8 range if an
   ASM_PREFIX64 is configured.  The enclosed IPv4 multicast address
   SHOULD be in 232/8 range if an SSM_PREFIX64 is configured.

   Embedding an IPv4 multicast address in the last 32 bits does not
   conflict with the Group IDs assigned by IANA (i.e., 0x00000001 to
   0x3FFFFFFF [RFC3307]).

   When several MPREFIX64 are available, it is RECOMMENDED to use the
   MPREFIX64 which preserve the scope of the IPv4 multicast address.

3.3.  Address Translation Algorithm

   IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast addresses are composed according to the
   following algorithm:

   o  Concatenate the MPREFIX64 and the 32 bits of the IPv4 address to
      obtain a 128-bit address.

   The IPv4 multicast addresses are extracted from the IPv4-embedded
   IPv6 multicast addresses according to the following algorithm:

   o  If the multicast address belongs to ff3x:0:8000::/96 or ffxx:
      8000::/20, extract the last 32 bits of the IPv6 multicast address.

3.4.  Textual Representation

   The embedded IPv4 address in an IPv6 multicast address is included in
   the last 32 bits; therefore dotted decimal notation can be used.

3.5.  Source IPv4 Address in the IPv6 Realm

   An IPv4 source is represented in the IPv6 realm with its IPv4-
   converted IPv6 address [RFC6052].


4.  Examples

   Figure 2 provides an example of ASM IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Address while
   Figure 3 provides an example of SSM IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Address.

   IPv4 multicast addresses used in the examples are derived from the
   IPv4 multicast block reserved for documentation in
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-mcaddrdoc].

5.  IANA Considerations

   Authors of this document request to reserve:

   o  ff3x:0:8000::/96 SSM range to embed an IPv4 multicast address in
      the last 32 bits.

   o  ffxx:8000::/20 ASM range to embed an IPv4 multicast address in the
      last 32 bits.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document defines an algorithmic translation of an IPv6 multicast
   address into an IPv4 multicast address, and vice versa.  The security
   considerations discussed in [RFC6052] are to be taken into
   consideration.

Appendix A.  Motivations

A.1.  Why an Address Format is Needed for Multicast IPv4-IPv6
      Interconnection?

   Arguments why an IPv6 address format is needed to embed multicast
   IPv4 address are quite similar to those of [RFC6052].  Concretely,
   the definition of a multicast address format embedding a multicast
   IPv4 address allows:

   o  Stateless IPv4-IPv6 header translation of multicast flows;

   o  Stateless IPv4-IPv6 PIM interworking function;

   o  Stateless IGMP-MLD interworking function (e.g., required for an
      IPv4 receiver to access to IPv4 multicast content via an IPv6
      network);

   o  Stateless (local) synthesis of IPv6 address when IPv4 multicast
      address are embedded in application payload (e.g., SDP [RFC4566]);

   o  Except the provisioning of the same MPREFIX64, no coordination is
      required between IPv4-IPv6 PIM interworking function, IGMP-MLD
      interworking function, IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection Function and any
      ALG (Application Level Gateway) in the path;

   o  Minimal operational constraints on the multicast address
      management: IPv6 multicast addresses can be constructed using what
      has been deployed for IPv4 delivery mode.

A.2.  Why Identifying an IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Multicast Address is
      Required?

   Reserving a dedicated multicast prefix for IPv4-IPv6 interconnection
   purposes is a means to guide the address selection process at the
   receiver side; in particular it assists the receiver to select the

   appropriate IP multicast address while avoiding to involve an IPv4-
   IPv6 interconnection function in the path.

   Two use cases to illustrate this behavior are provided below:

   1.  An ALG is required to help an IPv6 receiver to select the
       appropriate IP address when only the IPv4 address is advertised
       (e.g., using SDP); otherwise the access to the IPv4 multicast
       content can not be offered to the IPv6 receiver.  The ALG may be
       located downstream the receiver.  As such, the ALG does not know
       in advance whether the receiver is dual-stack or IPv6-only.  The
       ALG may be tuned to insert both the original IPv4 address and
       corresponding IPv6 multicast address.  If a dedicated prefix is
       not used, a dual-stack receiver may prefer to use the IPv6
       address to receive the multicast content.  This address selection
       would require multicast flows to cross an IPv4-IPv6
       interconnection function.

   2.  In order to avoid involving an ALG in the path, an IPv4-only
       source can advertise both its IPv4 address and IPv4-embedded IPv6
       multicast address.  If a dedicated prefix is not reserved, a
       dual-stack receiver may prefer to use the IPv6 address to receive
       the multicast content.  This address selection would require
       multicast flows to cross an IPv4-IPv6 interconnection function.

   Reserving dedicated IPv6 multicast prefixes for IPv4-IPv6
   interconnection purposes mitigates the issues discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-nat64-learn-analysis] in a multicast context.

A.3.  Location of the IPv4 Address

   There is no strong argument to allow for flexible options to encode
   the IPv4 address inside the multicast IPv6 address.  The option
   retained by the authors is to encode the multicast IPv4 address in
   the low-order 32 bits of the IPv6 address.

   This choice is also motivated by the need to be compliant with
   [RFC3306] and [RFC3956].
