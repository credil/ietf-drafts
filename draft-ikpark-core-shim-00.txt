                       draft-ikpark-core-shim-00.txt 


Abstract 

   This document defines shim header for the transfer of CoAP messages 
   over non-TCP/IP constrained networks. In this environment, IP and UDP 
   or TCP are not used, so that additional shim header as a container 
   for addresses of sender/receiver and the length of CoAP header and 
   its payload is required.

Internet-Draft             CoAP Shim Header                  July 2013 
    

    

1. Introduction 

   CoAP [CoAP] is a data transfer protocol over constrained nodes and 
   networks, e.g., 6LoWPAN. This protocol uses TCP/IP suit and some 
   other additional protocols designed for low-power and lossy networks 
   (LLN) like Routing Protocol for LLN (RPL) [RPL]. 

   Nowadays many sensors are involved in variable area like industry, 
   security, environmental and etc., and many of them don't use TCP/IP 
   stack yet. They use various vender-specific transfer protocols. Also, 
   they contain diverse media like IEEE 802.15.4, RS485, CAN, and RS232 
   (or UART). In the case IEEE 802.15.4, there is a standard protocol 
   for the transmission of IPv6 packets [RFC4944], but many of nodes use 
   vender-specific protocols instead of it. 

   Hence, a CoAP proxy box is required to interconnect this vender-
   specific non-TCP/IP network and LLN defined by IETF (e.g., 6LoWPAN). 
   CoAP is not required for vender-specific constrained nodes, because 
   the proxy can translate between vender-specific protocols and TCP/IP 
   as CoAP cross-proxy. But as a CoAP-to-CoAP proxy, the operation of 
   the proxy can be simplified, and the services are able to be 
   abstracted by CoAP overall networks, applying CoAP for both vender-
   specific and LLN nodes are recommended. 

   But there are two restrictions on applying CoAP to vender-specific 
   nodes. The first is the lack of address. Peer-to-peer media like UART 
   and RS232 has no address to identify each node. RS485 has an integer 
   value as an identifier, but there is no standardized way to present 
   or carry this value over networks. IEEE 802.15.4 has Network Address 
   in their standard, but this address is allocated by Coordinator 
   dynamically. 64-bit extended address is too long and is sometimes not 
   used. 

   The second is that CoAP has not PDU size information in its header. 
   CoAP calculates the PDU size with the information from underlying 
   protocol like the payload size in IP header. 

   As a result, to apply CoAP to vender-specific networks and nodes, new 
   underlying protocol for CoAP must be defined to complement these two 
   restrictions. In this document, new Shim Header is specifies as a 
   underlying protocol for CoAP, and an example is added to explain this 
   shim header.

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
   [RFC2119] when they appear in ALL CAPS. These words may also appear 
   in this document in lower case as plain English words, absent their 
   normative meanings. 


   Shim Header 

       In front of a CoAP header, a slim header is inserted instead of 
       IP header and this contains addresses of CoAP sender and receiver 
       and the length of CoAP header and its payload. 

   Local ID 

       A local ID is an address of CoAP sender or receiver, and it is 
       uniqueness in a vender-specific non-TCP/IP constrained network. 
       This ID has a 16-bit length hexadecimal value, that is IEEE 
       802.15.4 Network Address compatible, and it can be extensible 
       later. 

   CoAP Proxy 

       A CoAP proxy in this document is a CoAP-to-CoAP proxy from [CoAP]. 
       In additional, this CoAP proxy can read and insert a shim header 
       from/to the front of CoAP header. 

   Additional terminology for CoAP can be found in [CoAP].

                        Figure 1 Shim Header Format 

   Fig. 1 shows a basic format of shim header. Next is the explanation 
   of each field in the header. 

       * Pre: Preamble is a 4-bit field, and has a meaning of the start 
             of shim header. '0xa' is used currently. 

       * Ver: Version is also a 4-bit field, currently the version 
             number is '1'. 

       * Length: is the length of CoAP header and its payload followed 
             by the shim header. This has a value between 1 and 255. 

       * CoAP Source Local ID, CoAP Destination Local ID: are the local 
             IDs of the sender and receiver of its CoAP message. Each 
             field has 16-bit field. 

   Fig. 2 shows the extended format of shim header. This format is used 
   when the length of CoAP header and its payload is larger than 255. If 
   the value of Length field is '0', this means its followed field is 
   the 16-bit extended length field, not CoAP source ID. This field can 
   have a range of value from 0 to 65535.

       3.2. Identifying between CoAP Header and Shim Header 

   According to the type of constrained nodes, Shim header can be 
   hardcoded, or not be involved in the CoAP node implementation. But at 
   the following cases, CoAP and shim header must be identified when a 
   packet receiver of a node meets a start point of some header. 

       * The CoAP receiver has multiple heterogeneous media, and are not 
         able to identify the received interface among them. And some 
         media use shim header on their interfaces and the others are 
         not. 

       * The CoAP receiver receives CoAP messages from two or more other 
         CoAP nodes. 

   As a result, the start point of shim header must be differentiated 
   from it of CoAP header. According to the CoAP draft, CoAP header 
   starts with version and message type, which has a range of values 
   from 0x04 to 0x07. But in the case of shim header, it starts with 
   preamble field, and its value is '0xa' to identify shim header 
   against COAP header. 

       3.3. Example 

   As shown in [CoAP], first example in Appendix A illustrates a basic 
   Confirmable CoAP request and response in piggy-backed manner. In this 
   section, we add shim header to this example. In this case, the client 
   and the server are connected via non-TCP/IP. The client can be a data 
   collector node or a proxy node. The server may be a temperature 
   sensor. In this example, we assume that the client has an ID of 
   0x0000, and the server has an ID of 0x0001.
