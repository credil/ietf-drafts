    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a new DHCPv6 message type: RECONFIGURE-REQUEST.
      This message is sent by a DHCPv6 relay agent to notify a DHCPv6 server
      about a configuration information change, so that the DHCPv6 server can
      send a RECONFIGURE message accordingly.</t>

      <t>This document updates RFC3315 and RFC6422.<!--****
The current scope: only one CLIENTID is inserted; this identifies the client for whihc a reconfigure is to be sent
What to do when a group of clients are concerned: 
(1) say it is out of scope
(2) include a list of client-id options: when the max is reched, generate as indivudal message as needed to insert all client_ids
(3) reconfigure for all hosts behind the same relay?:    Query by Relay Identifier -  This query asks a server for the
      bindings associated with a specific relay; the relay is identified
      by a DUID carried in a Relay-ID option.

***
Relay agent: behaviour
****
behaviour of the server: 
when no binding match the clientid, silent ignore the message; otherwise continue.

      <section anchor="problem" title="Problem">
        <t><xref target="RFC6422"></xref> updates the DHCPv6 specification
        <xref target="RFC3315"></xref> with a new feature to let a DHCPv6
        relay agent communicate information towards a DHCPv6 Client, and which
        is not available at the DHCPv6 server. This is achieved owing to the
        use of RSOO (Relay-Supplied Options option) which carries
        configuration data to the DHCPv6 server. The data conveyed in an RSOO
        is then sent back by the DHCPv6 server to the requesting DHCPv6
        client.</t>

        <t>An example of a RSOO context is shown in <xref
        target="ex1"></xref>; only a subset of exchanged DHCPv6 and RADIUS
        messages is represented.</t>

        <t>Whenever the configuration information sent by the DHCPv6 relay
        agent to the DHCPv6 server change, the DHCPv6 server has no means to
        detect it so that it can send a Reconfigure message with the updated
        configuration data accordingly. A solution is sketched in <xref
        target="solution"></xref>.</t>

    <section anchor="solution" title="Proposed Solution">
      <t>To solve the problem described in <xref target="problem"></xref>,
      this document proposes a new DHCP message called Reconfigure-Request. In
      the example depicted in <xref target="ex3"></xref> a Reconfigure-Request
      message is sent by the DHCPv6 relay agent to a DHCPv6 server as soon as
      the configuration data conveyed in an RSOO option have changed. Upon
      receipt of this message, and if it is configured to support such mode,
      the DHCPv6 server must build a Reconfigure message. This message is then
      sent to the DHCPv6 relay, which in turn will forward the message to the
      appropriate DHCPv6 client.</t>

      <t>This setup assumes the relay has a record of the client, so that it
      has enough information to send the Reconfigure-Request message to the
      server. Means to recover state in failure events must be supported, but
      are not discussed in this document.</t>

        <t>Servers MUST silently discard any received RECONFIGURE-REQUEST
        messages that meet any of the following conditions:<list
            style="symbols">
            <t>the message does not include a Client Identifier Option <xref
            target="RFC3315"></xref>.</t>

            <t>the message includes a Server Identifier Option <xref

            Option does not match the server's identifier.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The server MUST be configurable to accept or reject
        RECONFIGURE-REQUEST messages. If the server is configured to reject
        RECONFIGURE-REQUEST, the server MUST silently discard any
        RECONFIGURE-REQUEST it receives.</t>

        <t>The relay agent MUST be configurable to accept or reject
        RECONFIGURE-REQUEST messages received from other relay agents. If the
        relay is configured to reject RECONFIGURE-REQUEST, the relay MUST
        silently discard any RECONFIGURE-REQUEST it receives. If the relay is
        configured to accept RECONFIGURE-REQUEST messages, these messages are
        relayed as specified in <xref target="RFC3315">Section 20.1.1
        of</xref>.</t>

        <t>Because RECONFIGURE-REQUEST message provides a mechanism for
        triggering the DHCP Reconfigure message, and the DHCP Reconfigure
        message can raise security threats (e.g., to control the timing of a
        DHCP renewal), the DHCP server MUST have some mechanism for
        determining that the relay agent is a trusted entity.
        RECONFIGURE-REQUEST messages originating from unknown relay agents
        MUST be silently dropped.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Creation and Transmission of RECONFIGURE-REQUEST">
        <t>For any event (e.g., modification of the configuration information)
        that requires the server to issue a Reconfigure message, the relay
        agent determines the client which is affected by the change and then
        builds a Reconfigure-Request message: the relay agent sets the
        "msg-type" field to RECONFIGURE-REQUEST and sets the "transaction-id "
        field to 0. The relay agent MUST include a Client Identifier Option
        <xref target="RFC3315"></xref> and a Link Address Option (<xref
        target="lloption"></xref>) so that the DHCPv6 server can identify the
        corresponding client and the link on which the client is located. The
        relay agent MAY supply the updated configuration in the RSOO <xref
        target="RFC6422"></xref>. The relay agent MAY supply a Reconfigure
        Message Option to indicate which form of Reconfigure to use. </t>

        <t>When several clients on the same link are concerned with a
        configuration change, the relay MUST include several Client Identifier
        Options, each of them identifies a specific client. If including
        Client Identifier Options of all impacted clients exceeds the maximum
        message size, the relay MUST generate several RECONFIGURE-REQUEST
        messages required to carry all Client Identifier Options.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Server Behaviour">
        <t>Upon receipt of a valid Reconfigure-Request message from a DHCPv6
        relay agent (see <xref target="validation"></xref>), the server
        determines the client(s) for which a Reconfigure message is to be
        sent.</t>

        <t>The server MAY use the content of the Reconfigure Message Option
        supplied by the relay agent to determine which form of Reconfigure to
        use.</t>

        <t>If RSOO is supplied, the server MAY use its content to double check
        whether a Reconfigure is required to be sent to the client. This
        assumes the server store the content of RSOO it used to generate
        configuration data sent to requesting clients.</t>

        <t>Then, the server MUST follow the procedure defined in Section 19.1
        of <xref target="RFC3315"></xref> to construct a Reconfigure message.
        This message may be sent directly to the DHCPv6 client or to a relay
        agent <xref target="RFC3315"></xref>.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Security considerations elaborated in <xref target="RFC3315"></xref>
      and <xref target="RFC6422"></xref> must be taken into account. In
      addition, DHCPv6 servers MAY be configured to discard relayed
      RECONFIGURE-REQUEST messages or restrict relay chaining (see <xref
      target="RFC5007"></xref> for more discussion about the rationale of this
      recommended behavior). Relay agents SHOULD implement appropriate means
      to prevent using RECONFIGURE-REQUEST messages as a denial-of-service
      attack on the DHCPv6 servers.</t>
