This document describes a compression method based on the data
compression algorithm described in International Telecommunication
Union (ITU-T) Recommendation V.44.  Recommendation V.44 is a modem
standard but Annex B, Clause B.1, of the recommendation describes the
implementation of V.44 in packet networks (e.g., V.44 Packet Method).
This document defines the application of V.44 Packet Method to the
Internet Protocol (IP) Payload Compression Protocol (RFC 2393).
RFC 2393 defines a method for applying lossless compression to the
payload portion of IP datagrams.
 
V.44 Packet Method is based upon the LZJH data compression
algorithm.  Throughout the remainder of this document the terms V.44
Packet Method and LZJH are synonymous.
