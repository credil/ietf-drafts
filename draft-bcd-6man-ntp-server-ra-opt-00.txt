Internet-Draft  IPv6 Router Advertisement Support for NTP  December 2011


1.  Introduction

   NTP [RFC5905] servers form a core component of the Internet
   infrastructure.  They are used to provide time and synchronization
   services for hosts and routers in a network, which is critical for
   many applications (event logging, security mechanisms and other
   services).  In order to synchronize the time, all routers and hosts
   need to be configured to point to a NTP server that will provide
   clocking to all the devices.  This ensures accurate and synchronized
   time among all devices.  Its usually recommended to choose among
   several NTP servers in case one of the servers becomes unreachable or
   its clock becomes unreliable.

   Neighbor Discovery (ND) for IP Version 6 and IPv6 Stateless Address
   Autoconfiguration provide ways to configure either fixed or mobile
   nodes with one or more IPv6 addresses, default routers and some other
   parameters like the link-layer address of the interface from which
   the Router Advertisement is sent, link MTU [RFC4861], IP address of
   the DNS servers [RFC5006], etc.

   This document proposes a new mechanism which uses a new IPv6 Router
   Advertisement (RA) option to allow IPv6 routers to advertise NTP
   server addresses to IPv6 hosts.

   RA-based NTP configuration is a useful, optional alternative in
   networks where an IPv6 host's address is autoconfigured through IPv6
   stateless address autoconfiguration, and where the delays in
   acquiring server addresses and communicating with the servers are
   critical.  RA-based NTP configuration allows the host to acquire the
   nearest server addresses on every link.  Furthermore, it learns these
   addresses from the same RA message that provides configuration
   information for the link, thereby avoiding an additional protocol
   run.  This can be beneficial in some mobile environments, such as
   with Mobile IPv6.

   The NTP Server Option that this document proposes is an extension of
   Router Advertisment.  It does not change the basic function of the
   existing ND/SLAAC mechanisms.

   Information that an IPv6 host or a router needs to run the basic
   Internet applications (such as the Clock Synchronization, Timestamp
   Verification, Certificate Expiration check, etc.) can be obtained
   with the addition of this option to Neighbor Discovery and address
   autoconfiguration.

   This mechanism works over a broad range of scenarios and leverages
   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery.  This works well on links that are high
   performance (e.g., Ethernet LANs) and low performance (e.g., cellular

   networks).  In the latter case, by combining the NTP server
   information (that this draft proposes) with the other information in
   the Router Advertisement, the IPv6 devices can learn all the
   information needed to use most Internet applications in a single
   transaction.  This not only saves bandwidth, but also minimizes the
   delay needed to learn the NTP server information.


2.  Overview

   This document defines a new ND option called NTP Server option that
   contains the addresses of the NTP servers.  Existing ND transport
   mechanisms (i.e., Advertisements and Solicitations) are used.  This
   works in the same way that hosts learn about routers and prefixes.
   An IPv6 host can configure the IPv6 addresses of one or more NTP
   servers via RA messages periodically sent by a router or solicited by
   Router Solicitation (RS) messages.

   This approach requires NTP Server information to be configured in the
   routers sending the advertisements.  The configuration of NTP server
   addresses in the routers can be done by manual configuration.  The
   automatic configuration of NTP server addresses in routers is out of
   scope for this document.

   The location of the NTP service, like any other Internet service, can
   be specified by an IP address or a Fully Qualified Domain Name
   (FQDN).


3.  Neighbor Discovery Extension

   The IPv6 NTP configuration mechanism in this document defines a new
   ND option in Neighbor Discovery - the NTP Server (NTPS) option.  This
   option serves as a container for server location information related
   to one NTP server or Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) [RFC4330]
   server.  This option can appear multiple times in a RA message.  Each
   instance of this option is to be considered by the NTP client or SNTP
   client as a server to include in its configuration.

   The option itself does not contain any value.  Instead, it contains
   one or several suboptions that carry NTP server or SNTP server
   location.  This option MUST include one, and only one, time source
   suboption.  It carries the NTP server or SNTP server location as a
   Unicast or Multicast IPv6 address or as an NTP server or SNTP server
   FQDN.  More time source suboptions may be defined in the future.
   While the FQDN option offers the most deployment flexibility,
   resiliency as well as security, the IP address options are defined to
   cover cases where a DNS dependency is not desirable.  If the NTP

   server or SNTP server location is an IPv6 multicast address, the
   client SHOULD use this address as an NTP multicast group address and
   listen to messages sent to this group in order to synchronize its
   clock.

   The format of the NTP Server (NTPS) Option is:

   Internationalized domain names are not allowed in this field.


4.  Security Considerations

   Because NTPS option does not change the base functions of existing
   ND/SLAAC mechanism, it can be claimed that the NTP Server option for
   RA has vulnerabilities similar to those existing in current
   mechanisms.  If the Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) protocol is used
   as a security mechanism for ND, all the ND options including the NTP
   Server option are automatically included in the signatures [RFC3971],
   and the NTPS transport is integrity-protected.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA needs to assign an option code for the NTP Server Option that
   will be used in the Router Advertisments.

   IANA is required to maintain a new number space of NTP Server
   suboptions as defined in this document.  IANA should assign future
   NTP time source suboptions with an "IETF Consensus" policy as
   described in [RFC5226].
