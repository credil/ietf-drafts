Abstract

   A range of Management Information Base (MIB) modules has been
   developed to help model and manage the various aspects of
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks.  These MIB modules are
   defined in separate documents that focus on the specific areas of
   responsibility of the modules that they describe.

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is a profile of MPLS
   functionality specific to the construction of packet-switched
   transport networks.

   This document describes the MIB-based architecture for MPLS-TP, 
   and indicates the interrelationships between different existing MIB 
   modules that can be leveraged for MPLS-TP network management and
   identifies areas where additional MIB modules are required.

1. Introduction

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is a packet transport
   technology based on a profile of the MPLS functionality specific
   to the construction of packet-switched transport networks. 
   MPLS is described in [RFC3031] and requirements for MPLS-TP are
   specified in [RFC5654]. 
   
   A range of Management Information Base (MIB) modules has been
   developed to help model and manage the various aspects of
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks. These MIB modules


King & Venkatesan, et al.                                      [Page 3]
draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-07.txt            March 2012


   are defined in separate documents that focus on the specific areas of
   responsibility for the modules that they describe.

   An MPLS-TP network can be operated via static provisioning of
   transport paths, Label Switched Paths (LSPs) and Pseudowires (PW).
   Or the elective use of a Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) control plane to 
   support dynamic provisioning of transport paths, LSPs and PWs. 
   
   This document describes the MIB-based management architecture for 
   MPLS, as extended for MPLS-TP. The document also indicates the 
   interrelationships between existing MIB modules that should be
   leveraged for MPLS-TP network management and identifies areas where
   additional MIB modules are required. 
   
   Note that [RFC5951] does not specify a preferred management interface 
   protocol to be used as the standard protocol for managing MPLS-TP 
   networks.

1.1 MPLS-TP Management Function

   The management of the MPLS-TP networks is separable from that of 
   its client networks so that the same means of management can be used
   regardless of the client. The management function of MPLS-TP
   includes fault management, configuration management, performance
   monitoring, and security management.
   
   The purpose of the management function is to provide control and
   monitoring of the MPLS transport profile protocol mechanisms and
   procedures. The requirements for the network management 
   functionality are found in [RFC5951].  A description of the network
   and element management architectures that can be applied to the 
   management of MPLS-based transport networks is found in [RFC5950].
   

2. Terminology

   This document also uses terminology from the MPLS architecture 
   document [RFC3031], PWE3 architecture [RFC4805], and the following 
   MPLS related MIB modules: MPLS TC MIB [RFC3811], MPLS LSR MIB 
   [RFC3813], MPLS TE MIB [RFC3812], MPLS LDP MIB [RFC3815], MPLS FTN
   MIB [RFC3814] and TE LINK MIB [RFC4220].
    

3. The SNMP Management Framework

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).



King & Venkatesan, et al.                                      [Page 4]
draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-07.txt            March 2012


   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).
   
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to Section 7. of
   [RFC3410].

   This document discusses MIB modules that are compliant to the SMIv2,
   which is described in [RFC2578], [RFC2579] and [RFC2580].


4. Overview of Existing Work

   This section describes the existing tools and techniques for
   managing and modeling MPLS networks, devices, and protocols. It is 
   intended to provide a description of the tool kit that is already 
   available. 
  
   Section 5 of this document outlines the applicability of existing
   MPLS MIB modules to MPLS-TP, describes the optional use of GMPLS MIB
   modules in MPLS-TP networks, and examines the additional MIB modules
   and objects that would be required for managing an MPLS-TP network.

4.1. MPLS Management Overview and Requirements

   [RFC4378] outlines how data plane protocols can assist in providing 
   the Operations and Management (OAM) requirements outlined in 
   [RFC4377] and how it is applied to the management functions of fault,
   configuration, accounting, performance, and security (commonly known
   as FCAPS) for MPLS networks.

   [RFC4221] describes the management architecture for MPLS. In 
   particular, it describes how the managed objects defined in various
   MPLS-related MIB modules model different aspects of MPLS, as well as
   the interactions and dependencies between each of these MIB modules.
   
   [RFC4377] describes the requirements for user and data plane OAM and
   applications for MPLS.  
   
   [RFC5654] describes the requirements for the optional use of a 
   control plane to support dynamic provisioning of MPLS-TP transport
   paths. The MPLS-TP LSP control plane is based on GMPLS and is 
   described in [RFC3945].   

4.2. An Introduction to the MPLS and Pseudowire MIB Modules

4.2.1. Structure of the MPLS MIB OID Tree

   The MPLS MIB Object Identifiers (OID) tree has the following 


King & Venkatesan, et al.                                      [Page 5]
draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-07.txt            March 2012


   structure. It is based on the tree originally set out in section 
   4.1 of [RFC4221] and has been enhanced to include other relevant MIB
   modules.

4.2.2. Textual Convention Modules

   MPLS-TC-STD-MIB [RFC3811], GMPLS-TC-STD-MIB [RFC4801], 
   IANA-GMPLS-TC-MIB [RFC4802] and PW-TC-STD-MIB [RFC5542] contains the
   Textual Conventions for MPLS and GMPLS networks.  These Textual
   Conventions should be imported by MIB modules which manage MPLS
   and GMPLS networks. Section 4.2.11. highlights dependencies on 
   additional external MIB modules
   
4.2.3. Label Switched Path (LSP) Modules

   An LSP is a path over which a labeled packet travels across the 
   sequence of LSRs for a given Forward Equivalence Class (FEC). When a
   packet, with or without label, arrives at an ingress LER of an LSP, 
   it is encapsulated with the label corresponding to the FEC and sent
   across the LSP. The labeled packet traverses across the LSRs and 
   arrives at the egress LER of the LSP, where, it gets forwarded 
   depending on the packet type it came with. LSPs could be nested using
   label stacking, such that, an LSP could traverse over another LSP. A
   further description of an LSP can be found in [RFC3031].

   MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB [RFC3813] describes the required objects to define
   the LSP.

4.2.4. Label Edge Router (LER) Modules

   Ingress and Egress LSRs of an LSP are known as Label Edge Routers 
   (LER). An ingress LER takes the incoming unlabeled or labeled packets 
   and encapsulates it with the corresponding label of the LSP it 
   represents, and forwards it, over to the adjacent LSR of the LSP. 
   Each FEC is mapped to a label forwarding entry, so that packet could
   be encapsulated with one or more label entries, referred as label 
   stack.

   The packet traverses across the LSP, and upon reaching the Egress 
   LER, further action will be taken to handle the packet, depending on
   the packet it received. MPLS Architecture [RFC3031] details
   the functionality of an Ingress and Egress LERs.

   MPLS-FTN-STD-MIB [RFC3814] describes the managed objects for mapping
   FEC to label bindings.

4.2.5. Label Switching Router (LSR) Modules

   A router which performs MPLS forwarding is known as an LSR. An LSR
   receives a labelled packet and performs forwarding action based on 
   the label received.
 
   LSR maintains a mapping of an incoming label and incoming interface 


King & Venkatesan, et al.                                      [Page 7]
draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-07.txt            March 2012


   to one or more outgoing label and outgoing interfaces in its 
   forwarding database. When a labelled packet is received, LSR examines
   the topmost label in the label stack and then does 'swap', 'push' or 
   'pop' operation based on the contents.
 
   MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB [RFC3813] describes the managed objects for modeling
   a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) [RFC3031] LSR. 
   MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB [RFC3813] contains the managed objects to maintain 
   mapping of in-segments to out-segments.

4.2.6. Pseudowire Modules

   The PW (Pseudowire) MIB architecture provides a layered modular model
   into which any supported emulated service such as Frame Relay, ATM, 
   Ethernet, TDM and SONET/SDH can be connected to any supported Packet
   Switched Network (PSN) type. This MIB architecture is modeled based
   on PW3 architecture [RFC3985].

   Emulated Service Layer, Generic PW Layer and PSN VC Layer constitute
   the different layers of the model. A combination of the MIB modules
   belonging to each layer provides the glue for mapping the emulated
   service onto the native PSN service. At least three MIB modules each
   belonging to a different layer are required to define a PW emulated
   service.

   - Service-Specific module is dependent on the emulated signal type 
     and helps in modeling emulated service layer.

   PW-ENET-STD-MIB [RFC5603] describes a model for managing Ethernet
   pseudowire services for transmission over a PSN. This MIB module is
   generic and common to all types of PSNs supported in the Pseudowire
   Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) Architecture [RFC3985], which describes
   the transport and encapsulation of L1 and L2 services over supported
   PSN types.

   In particular, the MIB module associates a port or specific VLANs on
   top of a physical Ethernet port or a virtual Ethernet interface (for
   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)) to a point-to-point PW.  It is
   complementary to the PW-STD-MIB [RFC5601], which manages the generic
   PW parameters common to all services, including all supported PSN
   types.

   PW-TDM-MIB [RFC5604] describes a model for managing TDM pseudowires,
   i.e., TDM data encapsulated for transmission over a Packet Switched
   Network (PSN).  The term TDM in this document is limited to the 
   scope of Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (PDH).  It is currently
   specified to carry any TDM Signals in either Structure Agnostic
   Transport mode (E1, T1, E3, and T3) or in Structure Aware
   Transport mode (E1, T1, and NxDS0) as defined in the Pseudowire


King & Venkatesan, et al.                                      [Page 8]
draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-07.txt            March 2012


   Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) TDM Requirements document [RFC4197].

   - Generic PW Module configures general parameters of the PW that are
     common to all types of emulated services and PSN types.

   PW-STD-MIB [RFC5601] defines a MIB module that can be
   used to manage pseudowire (PW) services for transmission over a
   Packet Switched Network (PSN) [RFC3931] [RFC4447].  This MIB module
   provides generic management of PWs that is common to all types of
   PSN and PW services defined by the IETF PWE3 Working Group.

   - PSN-specific module associate the PW with one or more "tunnels" 
     that carry the service over the PSN.  There is a different module
     for each type of PSN.
   
   PW-MPLS-STD-MIB [RFC5602] describes a model for managing pseudowire
   services for transmission over different flavors of MPLS tunnels.
   The general PW MIB module [RFC5601] defines the parameters global to
   the PW regardless of the underlying Packet Switched Network (PSN) 
   and emulated service.  This document is applicable for PWs that use
   MPLS PSN type in the PW-STD-MIB. Additionally this document describes
   the MIB objects that define pseudowire association to the MPLS PSN, 
   that is not specific to the carried service.

   Together, [RFC3811], [RFC3812] and [RFC3813] describe the modeling of
   an MPLS tunnel, and a tunnel's underlying cross-connects.  This MIB
   module supports MPLS-TE PSN, non-TE MPLS PSN (an outer tunnel created
   by the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) or manually), and MPLS PW
   label only (no outer tunnel).

4.2.7. Routing and Traffic Engineering

   In MPLS traffic engineering, it's possible to specify explicit routes
   or choose routes based on QOS metrics in setting up a path such that
   some specific data can be routed around network hot spots. TE LSPs 
   can be setup through a management plane or a control plane.

   MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812] describes managed objects for modeling a
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) [RFC3031] based traffic
   engineering.  This MIB module should be used in conjunction with the
   companion document [RFC3813] for MPLS based traffic engineering
   configuration and management.

4.2.8. Resiliency

   The purpose of MPLS resiliency is to ensure minimal interruption to
   traffic when the failure occurs within the system or network.
 
   Various components of MPLS resiliency solutions are; 


King & Venkatesan, et al.                                      [Page 9]
draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-07.txt            March 2012

   
   1) Graceful restart in LDP and RSVP-TE modules,
   2) Make Before Break,
   3) Protection Switching for LSPs,
   4) Fast ReRoute for LSPs,
   5) PW redundancy.

   The below modules only support the SNMP based MIB management
   for MPLS resiliency.

   MPLS Fast Reroute (FRR) is a restoration network resiliency mechanism 
   used in MPLS TE to redirect the traffic onto the backup LSP's in 10s
   of milliseconds in case of link or node failure across the LSP. 

   MPLS-FRR-GENERAL-STD-MIB [draft-ietf-mpls-fastreroute-mib-14] 
   contains objects that apply to any MPLS LSR implementing MPLS TE fast
   reroute functionality.
 
   MPLS-FRR-ONE2ONE-STD-MIB [draft-ietf-mpls-fastreroute-mib-14] 
   contains objects that apply to one-to-one backup method.
   MPLS-FRR-FACILITY-STD-MIB [draft-ietf-mpls-fastreroute-mib-14] 
   contains objects that apply to facility backup method.

   Protection Switching mechanisms have been designed to provide network
   resiliency for MPLS network. Different types of protection switching
   mechanisms such as 1:1, 1:N, 1+1 have been designed.
   
4.2.9. Fault Management and Performance Management 

   MPLS manages the LSP and pseudowire faults through the use of LSP 
   ping [RFC4379], VCCV [RFC5085], BFD for LSPs [RFC5884] and BFD for
   VCCV [RFC5885] tools.
   
   Current MPLS focuses on the in and/or out packet counters,
   errored packets, discontinuity time.

   Some of the MPLS and Pseudowire performance tables used for
   performance management are given below.

   mplsTunnelPerfTable [RFC3812] provides several counters (packets 
   forwarded, packets dropped because of errors) to measure the 
   performance of the MPLS tunnels.

   mplsInterfacePerfTable [RFC3813] provides performance information 
   (incoming and outgoing labels in use and lookup failures) on a 
   per-interface basis.

   mplsInSegmentPerfTable [RFC3813] contains statistical information
   (total packets received by the insegment, total errored packets
   received, total packets discarded, discontinuity time) for incoming


King & Venkatesan, et al.                                     [Page 10]
draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-07.txt            March 2012


   MPLS segments to an LSR.

   mplsOutSegmentPerfTable [RFC3813] contains statistical information 
   (total packets received, total errored packets received, total 
   packets discarded, discontinuity time) for outgoing MPLS segments 
   from an LSR.

   mplsFTNPerfTable [RFC3814] contains performance information for the 
   specified interface and an FTN entry mapped to this interface.

   mplsLdpEntityStatsTable [RFC3815] and mplsLdpSessionStatsTable 
   [RFC3815] contain statistical information (session attempts, errored
   packets, notifications) about an LDP entity.
  
   pwPerfCurrentTable [RFC5601], pwPerfIntervalTable [RFC5601], 
   pwPerf1DayIntervalTable [RFC5601] provides pseudowire performance
   information (in and/or out packets) based on time (current interval,
   preconfigured specific interval, 1day interval).

   pwEnetStatsTable [RFC5603] contains statistical counters specific for
   Ethernet PW.

   pwTDMPerfCurrentTable [RFC5604], pwTDMPerfIntervalTable [RFC5604] and 
   pwTDMPerf1DayIntervalTable [RFC5604] contain statistical informations 
   accumulated per 15-minute, 24 hour, 1 day respectively.
   
   gmplsTunnelErrorTable [RFC4802] and gmplsTunnelReversePerfTable 
   [RFC4802] provides information about performance errored packets and
   in/out packet counters.
  
4.2.10. MIB Module Interdependencies

   This section provides an overview of the relationship between the
   MPLS MIB modules for managing MPLS networks. More details of these 
   relationships are given below.
 
   [RFC4221] mainly focuses on the MPLS MIB module interdependencies, 
   this section also highlights the GMPLS and PW MIB modules
   interdependencies.
   
   The relationship "A --> B" means A depends on B and that MIB module 
   A uses an object, object identifier, or textual convention defined
   in MIB module B, or that MIB module A contains a pointer (index or
   RowPointer) to an object in MIB module B.

   +<---------------- PW-MPLS-STD-MIB-------------PAC-MAN------------->+
   
   Thus:

   -  All the MPLS MIB modules depend on MPLS-TC-STD-MIB.
  
   -  All the GMPLS MIB modules depend on GMPLS-TC-STD-MIB.
   
   -  All the PW MIB modules depend on PW-TC-STD-MIB.

   -  MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB, MPLS-TE-STD-MIB, MPLS-FTN-STD-MIB, 
      GMPLS-LSR-STD-MIB, and PW-MPLS-STD-MIB contain references to 
      objects in MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB.

   -  MPLS-LDP-GENERIC-STD-MIB contains references to objects in 
      MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB.

King & Venkatesan, et al.                                     [Page 12]
draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-07.txt            March 2012


   -  MPLS-FTN-STD-MIB, PW-MPLS-STD-MIB, and GMPLS-TE-STD-MIB contain 
      references to objects in MPLS-TE-STD-MIB.
   
   -  PW-MPLS-STD-MIB, and PW-ENET-STD-MIB contains references to 
      objects in PW-STD-MIB. 
   
   -  PW-STD-MIB contains references to objects in IANA-PWE3-MIB.

   -  GMPLS-TE-STD-MIB contains references to objects in 
      IANA-GMPLS-TC-MIB.

   -  GMPLS-LSR-STD-MIB contains references to objects in 
      GMPLS-LABEL-STD-MIB. 

   Note that there is a textual convention (MplsIndexType) defined in
   MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB that is imported by MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB.

4.2.11. Dependencies on External MIB Modules

   With the exception of MPLS-TC-STD-MIB, all the MPLS MIB modules have
   dependencies on the Interfaces MIB [RFC2863].  MPLS-FTN-STD-MIB
   references IP-capable interfaces on which received traffic is to be
   classified using indexes in the Interface Table (ifTable) of IF-MIB
   [RFC2863].  The other MPLS MIB modules reference MPLS-capable
   interfaces in ifTable.

   The Interfaces Group of IF-MIB [RFC2863] defines generic managed
   objects for managing interfaces.  The MPLS MIB modules contain
   media-specific extensions to the Interfaces Group for managing MPLS
   interfaces.

   The MPLS MIB modules assume the interpretation of the Interfaces
   Group to be in accordance with [RFC2863], which states that ifTable
   contains information on the managed resource's interfaces and that
   each sub-layer below the internetwork layer of a network interface is
   considered an interface.  Thus, the MPLS interface is represented as
   an entry in ifTable.

   The interrelation of entries in ifTable is defined by the Interfaces
   Stack Group defined in [RFC2863].
   
   The MPLS MIB modules have dependencies with the TE-LINK-STD-MIB 
   for maintaining the traffic engineering information.

   The MPLS MIB modules depend on the constrained shortest path first 
   (CSPF) module to obtain the path required for an MPLS tunnel to reach
   the end point of the tunnel and Bidirectional Forwarding Detection 
   (BFD) module to verify the data-plane failures of LSPs and PWs.



King & Venkatesan, et al.                                     [Page 13]
draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-07.txt            March 2012


   Finally, all of the MIB modules import standard textual conventions
   such as integers, strings, timestamps, etc., from the MIB modules in
   which they are defined.


5. Applicability of MPLS MIB modules to MPLS-TP

   This section highlights gaps in existing MPLS MIB modules in 
   order to determine extensions or additional MIB modules that are
   required to support MPLS-TP in MPLS networks
   
   [RFC5951] specifies the requirements for the management of equipment
   used in networks supporting an MPLS-TP. It also details the
   essential network management capabilities for operating networks
   consisting of MPLS-TP equipment.

   [RFC5950] provides the network management framework for MPLS-TP. The
   document explains how network elements and networks that support 
   MPLS-TP can be managed using solutions that satisfy the 
   requirements defined in [RFC5951]. The relationship between MPLS-TP
   management and OAM is described in the MPLS-TP framework [RFC5950]
   document.

   The MPLS MIB modules MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812], PW-STD-MIB [RFC5601]
   and MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB [RFC3813] and their associated MIB modules are 
   reused for MPLS based transport network management.
      
   Fault management and performance management form key parts of
   the Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) function. 
   MPLS-TP OAM is described in [MPLS-TP-OAM-FWK].
   
5.1 MPLS-TP Tunnel
  
5.1.1 Gap Analysis

   MPLS-TP tunnel can be operated over IP and/or ITU-T Carrier Code 
   (ICC) environments, below points capture the gaps in existing MPLS
   MIB modules for managing the MPLS-TP networks.

   - IP based environment
      i. MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812] does not support tunnel 
         Ingress/Egress identifier based on Global_ID and Node_ID 
         [RFC6370].
      ii. MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812] does not support
          co-routed/associated bidirectional tunnel configurations.    

   - ICC based environment   
      i. MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812] does not support tunnel LSR 
         identifier based on ICC.
    

King & Venkatesan, et al.                                     [Page 14]
draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-07.txt            March 2012


5.1.2 Recommendations

    - New MIB definitions may be created for Global_Node_ID and/or 
      ICC configurations.
   
    - MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB [RFC3813] MIB modules may be enhanced to identify
      the nexthop based on MAC address for IP-less environments. 
      OutSegment may be extended to hold the MAC-address also for
      IP-less environments.
   
    - MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812] and MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB may be 
      enhanced to provide static and signalling MIB module 
      extensions for co-routed/associated bidirectional LSPs.
   
5.2 MPLS-TP Pseudowire

5.2.1 Gap Analysis

   MPLS-TP Pseudowire can be operated over IP and/or ICC environments, 
   below points capture the gaps in existing PW MIB modules 
   for managing the MPLS-TP networks.

   [RFC6370] specifies an initial set of identifiers to be 
   used in MPLS-TP. These identifiers were chosen to be compatible with
   existing MPLS, GMPLS, and PW definitions.

   - IP based environment
      i. PW-STD-MIB [RFC5601] does not support
         PW end point identifier based on Global_ID and Node_ID.
      ii. PW-MPLS-STD-MIB [RFC5602] does not support
         its operation over co-routed/associated bidirectional tunnels.

   - ICC based environment   
      i. PW-STD-MIB [RFC5601] does not support
         PW end point identifier based on ICC.
   
5.2.2 Recommendations
  
   - PW-MPLS-STD-MIB [RFC5602] can be enhanced to operate over 
     co-routed/associated bi-directional tunnel.

5.3 MPLS-TP Sections

5.3.1 Gap Analysis  
   
   The existing MPLS MIB modules does not support MPLS-TP sections. 

5.3.2 Recommendations
 


King & Venkatesan, et al.                                     [Page 15]
draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-07.txt            March 2012


   Link specific and/or path/segment specific sections can be achieved
   by enhancing the IF-MIB [RFC2863], MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812] and
   PW-STD-MIB [RFC5601] MIB modules.

5.4 MPLS-TP OAM

5.4.1 Gap Analysis  

   MPLS manages the LSP and pseudowire faults through LSP ping 
   [RFC4379], VCCV [RFC5085], BFD for LSPs [RFC5884] and BFD for VCCV
   [RFC5885] tools. 

   The MPLS MIB modules do not support the below MPLS-TP OAM functions:
   
    o Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification
    o Remote Defect Indication
    o Alarm Reporting
    o Lock Reporting
    o Lock Instruct
    o Client Failure Indication
    o Packet Loss Measurement
    o Packet Delay Measurement 
   
5.4.2 Recommendations
  
   New MIB module for BFD can be created to address all the gaps 
   mentioned in Section 5.4.1. (Gap Analysis).

5.5 MPLS-TP Protection Switching and Recovery

5.5.1 Gap Analysis  

   An important aspect that MPLS-TP technology provides is protection
   switching. In general, the mechanism of protection switching 
   can be described as the substitution of a protection or standby 
   facility for a working or primary facility. 
   
   The MPLS MIB modules do not provide support for protection switching
   and recovery of three different topologies (linear, ring and mesh)
   available.
 
5.5.2 Recommendations
   
   New MIB modules can be created to address all the gaps mentioned
   in the 5.5.1 Gap Analysis section.

5.6 MPLS-TP Interfaces

5.6.1 Gap Analysis


King & Venkatesan, et al.                                     [Page 16]
draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-07.txt            March 2012


   As per [RFC6370], an LSR requires identification of the
   node itself and of its interfaces.  An interface is the attachment 
   point to a server layer MPLS-TP section or MPLS-TP tunnel.

   The MPLS MIB modules do not provide support for configuring
   the interfaces within the context of an operator.

5.6.2 Recommendations
 
   New MIB definitions can be created to address the gaps mentioned
   in the 5.6.1 Gap Analysis section.  

6. An Introduction to the MPLS-TP MIB Modules

   This section highlights new MIB modules that have been identified
   as being required for MPLS-TP. This section also provides an overview
   the purpose of each of the MIB modules within the MIB documents, what
   it can be used for, and how it relates to the other MIB modules.

   Note that each new MIB module (apart from Textual Conventions
   modules) will contain one or more Compliance Statements to indicate
   which objects must be supported in what manner to claim a specific 
   level of compliance. Additional text, either in the documents that 
   define the MIB modules or in separate Applicability Statements, will 
   define which Compliance Statements need to be conformed to in order 
   to provide specific MPLS-TP function. This document does not set any
   requirements in that respect although some recommendations are
   included in the sections that follow.

6.1 MPLS-TP MIB Modules

6.1.1 NEW MIB Modules for MPLS-TP

   Four new MIB modules are identified as follows:

   - Textual Conventions for MPLS-TP
   
   - Identifiers for MPLS-TP
   
   - LSR MIB Extensions for MPLS-TP
   
   - TE MIB Extensions for MPLS-TP

   Note that the MIB modules mentioned here are applicable for MPLS
   operations as well.




King & Venkatesan, et al.                                     [Page 17]
draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-07.txt            March 2012


6.1.2 Textual Conventions for MPLS-TP 

   A new MIB module needs to be written that will define textual 
   conventions [RFC2579] for MPLS-TP related MIB modules. These
   conventions allow multiple MIB modules to use the same syntax and
   format for a concept that is shared between the MIB modules. 

   For example, MEP identifier is used to identify maintenance entity 
   group end point within MPLS-TP networks. The textual convention 
   representing the MEP identifier should be defined in a new textual 
   convention MIB module. 

   All new extensions related to MPLS-TP are defined in the MIB module 
   and will be referenced by other MIB modules to support MPLS-TP.

6.1.3 Identifiers for MPLS-TP
   
   New Identifiers describe managed objects that are used to model 
   common MPLS-TP identifiers [RFC6370].

6.1.4 LSR MIB Extensions for MPLS-TP

   MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB describes managed objects for modeling an MPLS Label
   Switching Router (LSR).  This puts it at the heart of the management
   architecture for MPLS.

   In the case of MPLS-TP, the MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB is extended to support 
   the MPLS-TP LSP's, which are co-routed or associated bidirectional.
   This extended MIB is also applicable for modeling MPLS-TP tunnels.

6.1.5 Tunnel Extensions for MPLS-TP

   MPLS-TE-STD-MIB describes managed objects that are used to model and
   manage MPLS Traffic Engineered (TE) Tunnels.

   MPLS-TP tunnels are very similar to MPLS-TE tunnels, but are 
   co-routed or associated bidirectionally. 
   
   The MPLS-TE-STD-MIB must be extended to support the MPLS-TP specific
   attributes for the tunnel.

6.2 PWE3 MIB Modules for MPLS-TP

   This section provides an overview of Pseudowire extension MIB 
   modules to meet the MPLS based transport network requirements.

6.2.1 New MIB Modules for MPLS-TP Pseudowires

   Three new MIB modules are identified as follows:


King & Venkatesan, et al.                                     [Page 18]
draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-07.txt            March 2012


   - Pseudowire Extensions for MPLS-TP
   
   - Pseudowire MPLS Extensions for MPLS-TP
   
   - Pseudowire Textual Conventions for MPLS-TP

6.2.2 Pseudowire Textual Conventions for MPLS-TP

   PW-TC-STD-MIB MIB defines textual conventions used for pseudowire
   (PW) technology and for Pseudowire Edge-to-Edge Emulation (PWE3) MIB
   Modules. A new textual convention MIB module is required to define 
   textual definitions for MPLS-TP specific Pseudowire attributes.
   
6.2.3 Pseudowire Extensions for MPLS-TP

   PW-STD-MIB describes managed objects for modeling of Pseudowire 
   Edge-to-Edge services carried over a general Packet Switched Network. 
   This MIB module is extended to support MPLS-TP specific attributes
   related to Pseudowires.

6.2.4 Pseudowire MPLS Extensions for MPLS-TP

   PW-MPLS-STD-MIB defines the managed objects for Pseudowire 
   operations over MPLS LSR's. This MIB supports both, 
   manual and dynamically signaled PW's, point-to-point connections, 
   enables the use of any emulated service, MPLS-TE as outer tunnel 
   and no outer tunnel as MPLS-TE.

   The newly extended MIB defines the managed objects, extending 
   PW-MPLS-STD-MIB, by supporting with or without MPLS-TP as outer 
   tunnel.
   
6.3 OAM MIB Modules for MPLS-TP

   This section provides an overview of Operations, Administration, 
   and Maintenance (OAM) MIB modules for MPLS LSPs and Pseudowires.

6.3.1 New MIB Modules for OAM for MPLS-TP

   Two new MIB modules are identified as follows:

   - BFD MIB module
   
   - OAM MIB module

6.3.2 BFD MIB module

   BFD-STD-MIB defines managed objects for performing BFD operation in 
   IP networks. This MIB is modeled to support BFD protocol [RFC5880]. 


King & Venkatesan, et al.                                     [Page 19]
draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-07.txt            March 2012


   A new MIB module needs to be written that will be an extension to 
   BFD-STD-MIB managed objects to support BFD operations on MPLS LSPs 
   and PWs. 

6.3.3 Common OAM MIB modules
   
   A new MIB module needs to be written that will define managed objects
   for OAM maintenance identifiers i.e. Maintenance Entity Group 
   Identifiers (MEG), Maintenance Entity Group End-point (MEP), 
   Maintenance Entity Group Intermediate Point (MIP). Maintenance points
   are uniquely associated with a MEG. Within the context of a MEG, MEPs
   and MIPs must be uniquely identified.

6.4. Protection Switching and Recovery MIB Modules for MPLS-TP

   This section provides an overview of protection switching and 
   recovery MIB modules for MPLS LSPs and Pseudowires.
  
6.4.1 New MIB Modules for MPLS Protection Switching and Recovery

   Three new MIB modules are identified as follows:

   - Linear Protection Switching MIB module
   
   - Ring Protection Switching MIB module
   
   - Mesh Protection Switching MIB module

6.4.2 Linear Protection Switching MIB module

   A new MIB module needs to be written that will define managed objects
   for linear protection switching of MPLS LSPs and Pseudowires.

6.4.3 Ring Protection Switching MIB module

   A new MIB module will define managed objects for ring protection 
   switching of MPLS LSPs and Pseudowires.

6.4.4 Mesh Protection Switching MIB module

   A new MIB module needs to be written that will define managed objects
   for Mesh protection switching of MPLS LSPs and Pseudowires.


7. Management Options

   This document applies only to scenarios where MIB modules are used to
   manage the MPLS-TP network. It is not the intention of this document
   to provide instructions or advice to implementers of management 


King & Venkatesan, et al.                                     [Page 20]
draft-ietf-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-07.txt            March 2012


   systems, management agents, or managed entities.  It is, however,
   useful to make some observations about how the MIB modules described
   above might be used to manage MPLS systems, if SNMP is used in the 
   management interface.
   
   For MPLS specific management options, refer to [RFC4221] Section 12. 
   (Management Options).


8. Security Considerations

   This document describes the interrelationships amongst the different
   MIB modules relevant to MPLS-TP management and as such does not have
   any security implications in and of itself.

   Each IETF MIB document that specifies MIB objects for MPLS-TP must
   provide a proper security considerations section that explains the
   security aspects of those objects.

   The attention of readers is particularly drawn to the security
   implications of making MIB objects available for create or write
   access through an access protocol such as SNMP.  SNMPv1 by itself is
   an insecure environment.  Even if the network itself is made secure
   (for example, by using IPSec), there is no control over who on the
   secure network is allowed to access the objects in this MIB.  It is
   recommended that the implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the 
   User-based Security Model STD 62, RFC3414 [RFC3414], and the 
   View-based Access Control Model STD 62, RFC 3415 [RFC3415],
   is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of each MIB module is properly
   configured to give access to only those objects, and to those
   principals (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.


9. IANA Considerations
   
   This document has identified areas where additional MIB modules are
   neccessary for MPLS-TP. The new MIB modules recommended by this 
   document will require OID assignments from IANA. However, this 
   document makes no specific request for IANA action.
