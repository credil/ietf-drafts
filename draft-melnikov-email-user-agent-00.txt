1.  Introduction

   User-Agent and X-Mailer are common Email header fields for
   identifying any software (and its components) that generates email
   messages.  They are used for helping in debugging email generation
   and processing errors, for tracking use of different email clients.
   The User-Agent header field is already registered for use in HTTP
   [RFC2616] and NetNews [RFC5536].  This document registers it for use
   in email.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] when they
   appear in ALL CAPS.  These words also appear in this document in
   lower case as plain English words, absent their normative meanings.

   The formal syntax use the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234]
   notation including the core rules defined in Appendix B of RFC 5234
   [RFC5234].

3.  User-Agent header field

   The User-Agent header field contains information about the user agent
   (typically a Mail User Agent) generating the email message, for
   statistical purposes and tracing of standards violations to specific
   software in need of correction.

   ABNF for this header field is defined as follows:

         user-agent      =  "User-Agent:" 1*product [CFWS] CRLF

         product         =  [CFWS] token [ [CFWS] "/" product-version ]

Internet-Draft    User-Agent and X-Mailer Header Fields     October 2013


         product-version =  [CFWS] token

         CFWS            =  <Defined in RFC 5322>

         token           =  <Defined in RFC 2045 Section 5.1>


   This header field MAY contain multiple <product> tokens identifying
   the user agent and any subproducts that form a significant part of
   it, listed in order of their significance for identifying the
   application.

   NOTE: Many popular email clients and agents are using X-Mailer header
   field instead of the User-Agent header field.

   NOTE: [RFC2616] describes a similar facility for the HTTP protocol.
   The Email format differs in that "{" and "}" are allowed in tokens
   (<product> and <product-version>) and comments are permitted wherever
   white space is allowed.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the following list of header field names to
   the "Permanent Message Header Field Names" registry (in http://
   www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/perm-headers.html):

   Header field: User-Agent
   Applicable protocol: mail
   Status: standard
   Author/change controller: IESG (iesg@ietf.org) on behalf of the IETF
   Specification document(s): [[this document]]
   Related information: [RFC2616] (Section 14.43)

   Header field: X-Mailer
   Applicable protocol: mail
   Status: standard
   Author/change controller: IESG (iesg@ietf.org) on behalf of the IETF
   Specification document(s): [[this document]]
   Related information: [RFC2616] (Section 14.43)


5.  Security Considerations

   TBD
