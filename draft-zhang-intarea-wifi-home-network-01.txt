                     Carrier's Wifi at Home Network
                draft-zhang-intarea-wifi-home-network-01

Abstract

   Today operator could share the wifi network at subscriber's home for
   their public subscribers.  It need to upgrade the home router which
   has integrated wifi already.  Some technical requirements have been
   clarified in this document.

Internet-Draft              Wifi Home Network                  July 2012


1.  Introduction

   Lots of users are using Wifi at home, but they are not Carrier's
   Wifi, using Carrier's ESSID at home could help to expand operator's
   wifi network.  Normally home wifi is integrated with home router, so
   home router need to be updated to support both private home ESSID and
   Carrier's ESSID.  Operator could either subsidize or compensate some
   price for user who could allow to share their home wifi for their
   neighbors or passing-by people.


2.  Network Architecture

   The network architecture is shown as belowed figure 1, home router
   will advertise two ESSIDs, one is for home user "Bob's home", the
   other is Operator's ESSID.  Sometime home user need to deploy his own
   wifi AP2 to expand the coverage of wifi, that wifi will have the
   diffculty to advertise operator's ESSID because this AP2 is bought by
   user other than operator's free offer.

                     Figure 1: Carrier's wifi at home

   Operator's network architecture needs some upgrade which seems mostly
   diffculty part, but actually feasible since it is software based
   upgrade.  WLC which support CAPWAP need to be considered to be
   deployed standalone or integrate together with BRAS.  Policy Server
   which is used to assign QoS policy at home router, Wifi Portal page
   need to be used to authenticate the opeartor's wifi user.

3.  Requirements for Carrier's home network

   The requirement for carrier's wifi at home could be listed below

   1) The backhaul of home router need to upgrade to support CAPWAP
   protocols, BRAS in the backend also need to route operator's wifi
   traffic and CAPWAP control signaling to Wireless LAN Controller
   correctly.

   2) Operator's policy need to be downloaded into the home router to
   configure QoS policy inside the homoe router.  Mostly home user's
   traffic has high priority than neighbor operator's user or visiting
   operator's user

   3) Neighbor and passying-by people need to be authenticated by the
   operator's portal.

   4) Home router need to differentiate different VLAN network for home
   user and opeartor'wifi user.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


5.  Security Considerations

   Some applications may rely on the source address as the credentials,
   it may need to reestablish the new credential after the application
   switchs into a new source address.
