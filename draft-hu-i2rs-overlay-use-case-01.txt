                 draft-hu-i2rs-overlay-use-case-01.txt

Abstract

   This document proposes an overlay network use case.  The forwarding
   routers network is an overlay structure.  There are two kinds of
   forwarding routers: Edge Router(ER) and Core Routers(CR).  Edge
   Router encapsulates format data based on the tunnel type, which are
   established among Edge Routers.  Core Router would be very simple and
   cheap.  It focus on the encapsulation data forwarding.  In order to
   reduce the equipment cost of Edge Routers, the network virtualization
   is provided in this document.

1.  Introduction

   The current Internet core hierarchical structure has remained largely
   unchanged since its invention.  In the face of growing traffic,
   service providers must keep investing in bigger and faster routers
   and links, especially in the core part of Internet, even though
   revenues are growing quite slowly.

   It is necessary to bring up a new structure to keep the core part
   steadily and reduce the cost of core Router.  In addition, as modern
   networks grow in scale and complexity, the need for rapid and dynamic
   control increases.  I2RS ([I2RS-FRM]) provide a new routing system
   framework to meet the requirement.  There is a programmable interface
   for the forwarding router.  All the forwarding routers should support
   I2RS agent to communicate with controllers.  The forwarding routers
   gather the traffic and topology information, report to the
   controllers, and receive the policy from controllers.

   Besides the idea of programmable and open interface, another key
   feature is forwarding plane and control plane separation in the I2RS
   and software define network.  Some of the control and computing
   function could be separation from traditional routers.  By this way,
   We could reduce the cost of core forwarding device.  This document

Internet-Draft                I2RS Overlay                     July 2013


   proposes an overlay network structure based on the I2RS framework.
   We hope that the service and data encapsulation are all done in the
   routers of the edge of network, and the routers in the core part are
   only focus on MPLS data forwarding.  The RIB table of the routers in
   core part could only store very few IP routing record for management.
   In this way, the expensive TCAM chip for routers in the core part
   could be replaced by cheap ASIC chip, and the cost would be reduced
   significantly.  The full mesh tunnel is required for the edge
   Routers.  The forwarding routers in the overlay network are divided
   into two kinds based on the roles in the network: CR(Core Router) and
   ER(Edge Router).The Edge Routers encapsulate the forwarding data
   based on the tunnel type, gather topology information, and report
   traffic to the controller, while Core Routers would be MPLS switches
   actually, and focus on fast MPLS data forwarding and receive only
   policy related information(metadata)from the controller.

                            Figure 1 Overlay Structure


   The overlay structure is shown in Figure 1.  The upper half part of
   the Figure show a physical network.  The Edge Routers are located in
   the edge of the overlay network, and are logically connected through
   Core Routers.  The services and data encapsulation are done in the
   edge routers.  The Core Routers(MPLS Switches) are very simple and
   focus on the MPLS data forwarding according to the label forwarding
   table, and may not perceive any distinction among the tunnels to/from
   Edge Routers.

   The lower half of the Figure shows a logical tunnel network.  All the
   Edge Routers are connected via a logical-full mesh tunnel-based
   connection among them.  The tunnel could be MPLS tunnel.  Edge Router
   encapsulates/decapsulates MPLS data.

2.2.  The Benefit of Overlay Network Structure

   (1)  Lower cost down for Core Routers: For the Core Router, it is not
      required to compute route, and distribute protocol signal.  The
      Core Routers only store the equipment IP prefix, and do not store
      user IP prefix any more.  The RIB and FIB table for core Router
      are very small.  The size routing tables in the Core Routers does
      not increase and remains stable with the growth of the numbers of
      users.

   (2)  Improved network security: The overlay network structure
      improves network security by splitting(and hence isolating)the
      provider equipment and user station.  The attacks from hacker to
      core routers would therefore be separated by the edge routers.

   (3)  Support of network virtualization: Some of the control and
      computing function could be separated from Edge Router and be done
      by controller.  The edge router in the future is a hardware
      platform.  The service, policy ,and other control function, such
      as route computing, signal distribution can be furnished by
      special physical/virtual servers.  The network virtualization for
      Edge Router is discussed in section 3.

2.3.  Core Router Requirements

   The Core Router performs the following functions:

   (1)  Core Routers mainly focus on fast forwarding encapsulated data.

   (2)  The control plane is very simple.  It announces and floods the
      topology information.

   (3)  For compatibility reasons, Route computation may be needed, but
      is not necessary.

2.4.  Edge Router Requirement

   The edge Router performs the following functions:

   (1)  Access and resources management: Edge Routers support user
      Access authentication, authorization, and resource control and
      management.  When there is new user access network, the edge
      router support user access authentication, authorization.  If the
      subscriber is legal and registered, he/she should should pass the
      access authentication and authorization tests.

   (2)  Encapuslation data and tunnel type decision: Edge Router
      negotiates with the peer Edge router based on the service traffic
      through controller, and encapsulates the original data traffic.

   (3)  Topology management:Edge Router gathers the network topology
      information and reports the topology to the controller.  When the
      topology changes, the edge router reports the changes as well.

   (4)  Policy management: Edge Router identifies the policy from The
      I2RS Commissioner([I2RS-FRM]).

   (5)  Service management: Edge Router should identifies the services
      and performs the appropriate encapsulation.

   (6)  Route and signal protocol management: Edge Router computes route
      based on the topology information received from other edge router
      and core router.

   (7)  Tunnel control and management: Edge Routers manage and maintain
      tunnel information.  All the edge routers are connected over
      logical full-mesh based tunnel network.

   (8)  Traffic analysis and reporting: Edge router monitors the data
      traffic, and reports the traffic updates/changes.

3.  MPLS Tunnel automatic configuration

   The MPLS tunnel among the ER(edge Router) could be automatically
   configured and established according to the client requirment
   information.  The procedure is as following: The controller (I2RS
   clients) receives the VPN information from Edge Router through the
   programmable interface of I2RS Agent.  The VPN information includes
   VPN Table ID, table item.  The table item is composed of: item key
   value, exit interface, VPN identifies, VPN forwarding identifies,
   Master/Slave flag, load balance flag, keep alive time etc.

   The item key value is the packet destination address.  For example,
   if the packet is encapsulated as L2VPN, the item key value is MAC
   address, while if the packet is encapsulated as L3VPN,the item key
   value is IP address.

   Exit interface is the VPN binding interface or local device
   identifies when it is as the VPN information send from I2RS Agent to
   I2RS Client.  If the VPN information is send from I2RS Client to SR/
   CR through I2RS agent interface, the exit interface is the remote SR/
   CR indentifies or the local tunnel ID, which indicates the end to end
   connection from network management (I2RS Client) to CR/ER(I2RS
   Agent).

   VPN identifies is used to identify the unique global VPN in the area.

   VPN Table ID is the index of VPN user information item.

   VPN forwarding identifies is used to identify the forwarding data
   plane packet.  Generally, it is the MPLS label.

   Master/salve flag indicates the optimal and backup path, which could
   be used as path protection or traffic engineering.

   Load balance flag indicates multiple next hop for the forwarding
   identifies, which is used for load balance.

   Keep alive time indicates the alive time for the item

   Network management collects all the VPN user information, and
   computes the forwarding path and Unified policy based on it.  Then it
   download the forwarding information to each ER/SR through I2RS Agent
   interface.

   In the overlay network structure, the ER are full mesh.  This session
   provides a solution to setup SA(security Alliance) among ERs.  The
   security parameter negotiation could be finished through I2RS Client.


                              +--------------+
                              |              |
                            . | Controller   |.
                           /  |              | \
                          .   +--------------+  .
            =============/=======================\==================
                        .     ...........         .
                       /      .         .          \
               +------+       . Overlay .        +------+
               |      +-------.         .--------|      |
               | ER1  |       . Tunnel  .        | ER2  |
               +------+       ...........        +------+



   Take the following figure(figure 2) as example:

   ER1 and ER2 need to establish SA(security Alliance), and adopt IPSec
   as the security transport channel.

   (1)  ER1 and ER2 connect to controller(I2RS Client) by logical
      tunnel, and the controller download the IPSec SA parameters to
      them respectively.  The parameters include: VPN Type(for example
      IPSec, L2VPN etc.), direction of AS(export or import), address
      family(IPv4 or IPv6), encapsulation mode , encapsulation
      protocol(AH or ESP), authentication algorithm (MD5 or SHA), ESP
      algorithm mode(Encryption or compression algorithm), Encryption
      mode, SA lifetime type, SA index, destination IP address of IPSec,
      Source IP address of IPSec, Secret key, Security parameter index
      information(SPI), Access control list(ACL) configuration.

   (2)  ER1 and ER2 establish IPSec security channel respectively.  They
      negotiate the IPSec parameter with controller through IKE protocol
      . By this way, the ERs and controller establish a security and
      reliable connection link.

   (3)  The controller download the necessary parameters to ERs through
      network routing protocol(such as BGP) or Netconf protocol.

   (4)  ERs receives the packets with required parameters from
      controller(I2RS Client), and decryption the packets, then writing
      the IPSec parameters to SD table.

   (5)  Then the Security alliance between ER1 and ER2 is established.

   (6)  When the Security alliance is expired, controller re-computes
      the secret key, and restart the above steps to re-establish the
      security alliance.

5.  Network Virtualization(NV)

5.1.  Benefits of Network Virtualization

   (1)  NV reduces ER complexity and equipment costs.

   (2)  NV allows flexibility and rapid deployment of new services;
      services can also be quickly scaled up/down based on demands.

   (3)  Seamless support of scalability and reliability

   (4)  NV allows flexibility and simplicity of function combination,
      for co-existence with hardware based network platform.  An ER
      could be utilized both as BRAS, Firewall, or NAT equipment on the
      same hardware platform.

5.2.  Applications and Requirements

   (1)  Tunnel gateway elements: IPSec/SSL VPN gateway.

   (2)  Traffic analytics: DPI, QoS measurement, SLA agent.

   (3)  Converged and network-wide functions: AAA Server, policy control
      and charging platform.

   (4)  Security function: Firewalls, virus scanners, instruction
      detection and prevention systems.

5.3.  Network Virtualization

   Edge routers can support network virtualization, An ER can be a
   hardware based platform, and the other necessary functions can be
   supported via separate servers A programmable interface between
   functional server and edge router can be used to support this
   paradigm.  When there is new service, we only need to add a new
   server to support that service, and there may be minimal or no
   changes required to the edge router.
