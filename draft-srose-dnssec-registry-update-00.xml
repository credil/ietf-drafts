<abstract>
	<t>
	The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) requires the use of
	cryptographic algorithm suites for generating digital signatures over DNS data.  The algorithms specified for
	use with DNSSEC are reflected in an IANA maintained registry.  This document presents a set of changes for
	some entries of the registry and presents a new registry table.
	</t>

<section title="Introduction">
	<t>
	The Domain Name System (DNS) Security Extensions (DNSSEC) <xref target="RFC4033" />, <xref target="RFC4034" />,
	<xref target="RFC4035" />, <xref target="RFC4509" />, <xref target="RFC5155" />, and <xref target="RFC5702" /> uses digital signatures over DNS data
	to provide source authentication and integrity protection.  DNSSEC uses an IANA registry
	to list codes for digital signature algorithms (consisting of a cryptographic
	algorithm and one-way hash function).   
	</t>
	<t>
    This document replaces the current IANA registry for Domain Name
	System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers with a newly defined registry table.  This new table (Section 2.2 below) 
    contains a collection of changes to selected entries originally set aside for future algorithm specification that did
    not occur. These entries are changed to "Reserved" to avoid potential conflicts with older implementations.  This 
    document also brings the list of references for entries up to date.
	</t>

</section>
<section title="The DNS Security Algorithm Number Sub-registry">
	<t>
	The DNS Security Algorithm Number sub-registry (part of the Domain Name
	System (DNS) Security Number registry) will be replaced with the table below. 
        There are additional differences to entries that are described in sub-section 2.1 and
	the overall new registry table is in sub-section 2.2.  
	</t>
  <section title="Updates and Additions">
        <t>
        This document updates three entries in the Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC)
	Algorithm Registry.  They are:
	</t>
	<t>
        The description for assignment number 4 is changed to "Reserved".
	</t>
	<t>
        The description for assignment number 9 is changed to "Reserved".
	</t>
	<t>
        The description for assignment number 11 is changed to "Reserved".</t> 
    <t>
	The above values are changed to "Reserved" because they were placeholders for algorithms that
	were not fully specified for use with DNSSEC.  Older implementations may still have these algorithm 
	codes assigned, so these codes are reserved to prevent potential incompatibilities.
