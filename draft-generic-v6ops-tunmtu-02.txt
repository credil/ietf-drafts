                    Generic Tunnel MTU Determination
                   draft-generic-v6ops-tunmtu-02.txt

Abstract

   The Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) for popular IP-within-IP tunnels
   is currently recommended to be set to 1500 (or less) minus the length
   of the encapsulation headers when static MTU determination is used.
   This requires the tunnel ingress to either fragment any IP packet
   larger than the MTU or drop the packet and return an ICMP Packet Too
   Big (PTB) message.  Concerns for operational issues with Path MTU
   Discovery (PMTUD) point to the possibility of MTU-related black holes
   when a packet is dropped due to an MTU restriction.  The current
   "Internet cell size" is therefore stuck at 1500 bytes (i.e., the
   minimum MTU configured by the vast majority of links in the
   Internet), but the desired end state is full accommodation of MTU
   diversity.  This document therefore presents a method to boost the
   tunnel MTU to larger values.

Internet-Draft             Generic Tunnel MTU                  June 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) for popular IP-within-IP tunnels
   is currently recommended to be set to 1500 (or less) minus the length
   of the encapsulation headers when static MTU determination is used.
   This requires the tunnel ingress to either fragment any IP packet
   larger than the MTU or drop the packet and return an ICMP Packet Too
   Big (PTB) message [RFC0791][RFC2460].  Concerns for operational
   issues with Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) [RFC1191][RFC1981] point to
   the possibility of MTU-related black holes when a packet is dropped
   due to an MTU restriction.  The current "Internet cell size" is
   therefore stuck at 1500 bytes (i.e., the minimum MTU configured by
   the vast majority of links in the Internet), but the desired end
   state is full accommodation of MTU diversity.  This document
   therefore presents a method to boost the tunnel MTU to larger values.

   Pushing the tunnel MTU to 1500 bytes or beyond is met with the
   challenge that the addition of encapsulation headers would cause an
   inner IP packet that is slightly less than 1500 bytes to appear as a
   1501 byte or larger outer IP packet on the wire.  This can result in
   the packet being either fragmented or dropped by a router that
   connects to a 1500 byte link.  Using the approach outlined in this
   document, the tunnel ingress avoids this issue by performing IP
   fragmentation on the inner packet before encapsulating each fragment
   in outer headers.  The approach is outlined in the following
   sections.


2.  Problem Statement

   When an IP tunnel configures a smaller MTU than 1500 bytes, packets
   that are small enough to traverse earlier links in the path toward
   the final destination may be dropped at the tunnel ingress with a PTB
   message returned to the original source.  However, operational
   experience has shown that the PTB messages can be lost in the network
   due to filtering in which case the source does not receive
   notification of the loss.  It is therefore highly desirable that the
   tunnel configure an MTU of at least 1500 bytes, even though
   encapsulation would cause the tunneled packet to be larger than 1500
   bytes.

   One possibility is to use IP fragmentation of the outer IP layer
   protocol so that inner packets up to 1500 bytes are delivered even if
   the tunnel encapsulation causes the outer packet to be larger than
   1500 bytes.  However, fragmentation has been shown to be dangerous at
   high data rates due to the Identification field wrapping while
   reassemblies are still active [RFC4963].  Also, if outer IP
   fragmentation were used the tunnel egress would need to reassemble

   which can be an onerous burden when the egress is located on a
   router.  The tunnel ingress further has no assurance that the egress
   can reassemble packets larger than 1500 bytes.

   A second possibility is to enable PMTUD on the outer packet.
   However, the PTB messages that may result could either be lost on the
   return path to the tunnel ingress or may not contain enough
   information for translation into an inner packet PTB for delivery to
   the original source.  Still another possibility is for the tunnel
   ingress to maintain state about MTU sizes for various tunnel
   egresses, but this becomes unwieldy when the number of egresses is
   large.

   In short, PMTUD is a mess and new approaches are needed.


3.  Tunnel MTU

   Section 3.2 of [RFC4213] presents both static and dynamic MTU
   determination algorithms.  Similar algorithms appear in other
   tunneling mechanisms.  These algorithms have been shown to be
   problematic in many instances, as discussed in Section 2.  This
   document therefore proposes a generic MTU determination method
   suitable for all tunnel types via the following algorithm:


      1. set "HLEN" to the length of the encapsulation headers.
      2. set the tunnel ingress MTU to "infinity", where "infinity"
         is defined as ((2^32 - 1) - HLEN) for tunnels over IPv6
         and ((2^16 - 1) - HLEN) for tunnels over IPv4.
      3. for IP packets to be admitted into the tunnel:
         a) if the packet is 1501 or more:
            - if the packet is an atomic packet (*) admit it
              into the tunnel if it is no larger than the MTU
              of the underlying interface; otherwise, drop the
              packet and return a PTB message.
            - if the packet is not an atomic packet, break it
              into N pieces (where each piece is a random length
              between 500-1000 bytes) and admit each piece into
              the tunnel.
         b) if the packet is between 1281 - 1500:
            - break the packet into 2 pieces (where each piece
              is a random length between 500-1000 bytes) and
              admit each piece into the tunnel.
         c) if the packet is 1280 or less:
            - admit the packet into the tunnel
     4. the IP destination gets to reassemble if necessary

   (*) An "atomic packet" is an IPv6 packet that does not contain a
   fragment header, or an IPv4 packet with (DF=1 && MF=0 && Offset=0)
   [I-D.ietf-intarea-ipv4-id-update].

   In the above algorithm, clause 3 a) requires that atomic packets not
   be subject to fragmentation within the tunnel.  Instead, the tunnel
   ingress should process any PTB messages returned by the tunnel and
   translate them into a corresponding PTB message to return to the
   original source.  In clauses 3 b) and 3 c), fragmentation within the
   tunnel must be permitted, however the fragment size chosen for inner
   fragmentation before encapsulation reduces the likelihood that tunnel
   fragmentation will occur following encapsulation.


4.  Inner Packet Fragmentation and Identification

   For non-atomic inner IP packets, clause 3 b) in the algorithm in
   Section 3 performs inner fragmentation using the Identification value
   already present in the packet.  The tunnel ingress then admits each
   fragment into the tunnel unconditionally, since it is the original
   source (and not the tunnel) that asserts the uniqueness of the
   packet's Identification value.  For atomic inner IP packets, clause 3
   b) in the algorithm in Section 3 ignores the requirement that routers
   in the network must not fragment atomic packets.  The rest of this
   section discusses considerations for fragmentation of atomic IP
   packets.

   The tunnel ingress maintains a randomly-initialized and
   arithmetically-increasing Identification value as either a per-tunnel
   or per-destination variable.  For IPv6 atomic packets, the use of
   inner fragmentation requires that the tunnel ingress insert an IPv6
   fragment header on each fragment.  For IPv4 atomic packets, the
   tunnel ingress must rewrite the value in the packet header
   Identification field.  In both cases, we observe that the
   Identification field provides sufficient protection against
   accidental reassembly of fragments from different IP packets given
   careful operational considerations.

   Specifically, the tunnel ingress must ensure that there will be no IP
   fragments alive in the system with duplicate Identification values.
   Since [RFC2460] specifies that the maximum time a node may retain an
   incomplete fragmented packet is 60 seconds, this means that the
   tunnel ingress must not allow the Identification values to be
   repeated within this timeframe.  The tunnel ingress can therefore
   calculate a maximum data rate for admission of fragmented packets
   into the tunnel.

   For IPv4, to avoid Identification value duplication the tunnel

   ingress must admit no more than (2^16 / 60) = 1092 IPv4 packets
   requiring fragmentation into the tunnel per second.  In the worst
   case, consider that each packet is 1281 bytes (i.e., 10248 bits) in
   length.  The tunnel ingress can then calculate the maximum data rate
   as (1092 * 10248) = 11190816 bits/sec, or approximately 11 Mbps.  It
   is therefore essential that the tunnel ingress set a rate limit to no
   more than 11 Mbps for those atomic IPv4 packets that will require
   fragmentation.  This restriction can be relaxed if the tunnel ingress
   maintains a per-destination Identification value instead of a single
   Identification value for all destinations.

   For IPv6, to avoid Identification value duplication the tunnel
   ingress must admit no more than (2^32 / 60) = 71582788 IPv6 packets
   requiring fragmentation into the tunnel per second.  In the worst
   case, consider that each packet is 1281 bytes (i.e., 10248 bits) in
   length.  The tunnel ingress can then calculate the maximum data rate
   as (71582788 * 10248) = 733580411424 bits/sec, or approximately 733
   Gbps.  It is therefore essential that the tunnel ingress set a rate
   limit to no more than 733 Gbps for those atomic IPv6 packets that
   will require fragmentation.  This restriction can be relaxed if the
   tunnel ingress maintains a per-destination Identification value
   instead of a single Identification value for all destinations.

   Note that a possible conflict exists when a source host emits both
   atomic and non-atomic packets.  In that case, there is a small
   possibility that the Identification values used by the source host in
   non-atomic packets will temporarily be in close correlation with
   those used by the tunnel ingress in atomic packets, where a
   "collision" may occur in the Identification values.  Factors that
   mitigate such conflicts are the random assignment of the initial
   Identification value, random arrivals of atomic and non-atomic
   packets, the random length of the fragments used by the tunnel
   ingress (i.e., to cause a length mismatch for colliding reassemblies)
   and, in even rarer instance, the use of the Internet checksum
   following reassembly.


5.  Applicability

   This approach applies to common IPv6 transition mechanisms, including
   configured tunnels [RFC4213], 6to4 [RFC3056], ISATAP [RFC5214], DSMIP
   [RFC5555], 6rd [RFC5969], etc.

   This same approach can further be applied to any variety of IP-
   within-IP tunnels, including GRE [RFC1701], IPv4-in-IPv4 [RFC2003],
   IPv6-in-IPv6 [RFC2473], IPv4-in-IPv6 [RFC6333], IPsec [RFC4301],
   Teredo [RFC4380], LISP [I-D.ietf-lisp], SEAL
   [I-D.templin-intarea-seal], etc.
