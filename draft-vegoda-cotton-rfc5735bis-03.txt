Abstract

   This document describes the global and other specialized IPv4 address
   blocks that have been assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA).  It does not address IPv4 address space assigned to
   operators and users through the Regional Internet Registries, nor
   does it address IPv4 address space assigned directly by IANA prior to
   the creation of the Regional Internet Registries.  It also does not
   address allocations or assignments of IPv6 addresses or autonomous
   system numbers.  This document obsoletes RFC 5735 and updates RFC
   6441.

   The substantive change between this document and RFC 5735 is that it
   includes 100.64.0.0/10, which was assigned in RFC 6598.

Internet-Draft         Special Use IPv4 Addresses            August 2012


1.  Introduction

   Throughout its history, the Internet has employed a central Internet
   Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) responsible for the allocation and
   assignment of various identifiers needed for the operation of the
   Internet [RFC1174].  In the case of the IPv4 address space, the IANA
   allocates parts of the address space to Regional Internet Registries
   (RIRs) according to their established needs.  These RIRs are
   responsible for the registration of IPv4 addresses to operators and
   users of the Internet within their regions.

   On an ongoing basis, IANA assignmnets have been made using policies
   established by the IETF to support the Internet Standards Process
   described in Section 4 of [RFC2860].

   Small portions of the IPv4 address space have been allocated or
   assigned directly by the IANA for global or other specialized
   purposes.  These allocations and assignments have been documented in
   a variety of RFCs and other documents.  This document is intended to
   collect these scattered references and provide a current list of
   special use IPv4 addresses.

   This document is a revision of RFC 5735 [RFC5735], which it
   obsoletes; its primary purpose is to reflect the changes to the list
   of special IPv4 assignments since the publication of RFC 5735.  It is
   a companion to [RFC5156] which describes special IPv6 addresses.


2.  Global and Other Specialized Address Blocks

   0.0.0.0/8 - Addresses in this block refer to source hosts on "this"
   network.  Address 0.0.0.0/32 may be used as a source address for this
   host on this network; other addresses within 0.0.0.0/8 may be used to
   refer to specified hosts on this network [RFC1122], section 3.2.1.3.

   10.0.0.0/8 - This block is set aside for use in private networks.
   Its intended use is documented in [RFC1918].  As described in that
   RFC, addresses within this block do not legitimately appear on the
   public Internet.  These addresses can be used without any
   coordination with IANA or an Internet registry.

   127.0.0.0/8 - This block is assigned for use as the Internet host
   loopback address.  A datagram sent by a higher level protocol to an
   address anywhere within this block loops back inside the host.  This
   is ordinarily implemented using only 127.0.0.1/32 for loopback.  As
   described in [RFC1122], Section 3.2.1.3, addresses within the entire
   127.0.0.0/8 block do not legitimately appear on any network anywhere.

   100.64.0.0/10 - This block is used as Shared Address Space.
   [RFC6598] states that Shared Address Space can only be used in
   Service Provider networks or on routing equipment that is able to do
   address translation across router interfaces when addresses are
   identical on two different interfaces.

   169.254.0.0/16 - This is the "link local" block.  As described in
   [RFC3927], it is allocated for communication between hosts on a
   single link.  Hosts obtain these addresses by auto-configuration,
   such as when a DHCP server cannot be found.

   172.16.0.0/12 - This block is set aside for use in private networks.
   Its intended use is documented in [RFC1918].  As described in that
   RFC, addresses within this block do not legitimately appear the
   public Internet.  These addresses can be used without any
   coordination with IANA or an Internet registry.

   192.0.0.0/24 - This block is reserved for IETF protocol assignments.
   At the time of writing this document, there are no current
   assignments.  Allocation policy for future assignments is given in
   [RFC5736].

   192.0.2.0/24 - This block is assigned as "TEST-NET-1" for use in
   documentation and example code.  It is often used in conjunction with
   domain names example.com or example.net in vendor and protocol
   documentation.  As described in [RFC5737], addresses within this
   block do not legitimately appear on the public Internet and can be
   used without any coordination with IANA or an Internet registry.  See
   [RFC1166].

   192.88.99.0/24 - This block is allocated for use as 6to4 relay
   anycast addresses, in to [RFC3068].  In contrast with previously
   described blocks, packets destined to addresses from this block do
   appear in the public Internet.  [RFC3068], Section 7 describes
   operational practices to prevent the malicious use of this block in
   routing protocols.

   192.168.0.0/16 - This block is set aside for use in private networks.
   Its intended use is documented in [RFC1918].  As described in that
   RFC, addresses within this block do not legitimately appear the
   public Internet.  These addresses can be used without any
   coordination with IANA or an Internet registry.

   198.18.0.0/15 - This block has been allocated for use in benchmark
   tests of network interconnect devices.  [RFC2544] explains that this
   range was assigned to minimize the chance of conflict in case a
   testing device were to be accidentally connected to part of the
   Internet.  Packets with source addresses from this range are not

   meant to be forwarded across the Internet.

   198.51.100.0/24 - This block is assigned as "TEST-NET-2" for use in
   documentation and example code.  It is often used in conjunction with
   domain names example.com or example.net in vendor and protocol
   documentation.  As described in [RFC5737], addresses within this
   block do not legitimately appear on the public Internet and can be
   used without any coordination with IANA or an Internet registry.

   203.0.113.0/24 - This block is assigned as "TEST-NET-3" for use in
   documentation and example code.  It is often used in conjunction with
   domain names example.com or example.net in vendor and protocol
   documentation.  As described in [RFC5737], addresses within this
   block do not legitimately appear on the public Internet and can be
   used without any coordination with IANA or an Internet registry.

   224.0.0.0/4 - This block, formerly known as the Class D address
   space, is allocated for use in IPv4 multicast address assignments.
   The IANA guidelines for assignments from this space are described in
   [RFC5771].

   240.0.0.0/4 - This block, formerly known as the Class E address
   space, is reserved for future use, see [RFC1112], section 4.

   The one exception to this is the "limited broadcast" destination
   address 255.255.255.255.  As described in [RFC0919] and [RFC0922],
   packets with this destination address are not forwarded at IP layer.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document describes the past and current practices, but does not
   create any new requirements for assignments or allocations by the
   IANA.


5.  Security Considerations

   The particular assigned values of special use IPv4 addresses
   cataloged in this document do not directly raise security issues.
   However, the Internet does not inherently protect against abuse of
   these addresses; if you expect (for instance) that all packets from a
   private address space such as the 10.0.0.0/8 block or the link local
   block 169.254.0.0/16 originate within your subnet, all routers at the
   border of your network should filter such packets that originate from
   outside your network.  Attacks have been mounted that depend on the
   unexpected use of some of these addresses.

   It should also be noted that some of these address blocks may be used
   legitimately outside of a single administrative domain, and may
   appear on the global Internet.  Security policy should not blindly

   filter all of these address spaces without due consideration, and
   network operators are encouraged to review this document, and
   references contained therein, and determine what security policies
   should be associated with each of these address blocks within their
   specific operating environments.
