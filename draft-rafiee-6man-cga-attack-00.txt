INTERNET DRAFT                               CGA AttackNovember 25, 2013



1.  Introduction 

   Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972] is one of the 
   important options of Secure Neighbor Discovery (SeND) [RFC3971] in 
   IPv6 networks. CGA provides the node with the proof of IP address 
   ownership by finding a binding between the public key and the node's 
   IP address. Therefore, It can protect the nodes from IP spoofing 
   attack and prevent forging the identity. However, CGA, itself is 
   vulnerable to some types of attacks such as DoS, replay attack (The 
   use of timestamp would mitigate this attack), etc [3]. The goal of 
   this document is not to focus on the well-known attacks but the new 
   CGA vulnerabilities. 



2.  Sec value vulnerability 

   CGA values are the fingerprint of public key. They are generated by 
   executing a hash function on public key and some other parameters. 
   Since the default algorithm for generating this hash is SHA-1, the 
   attacker node only needs to do brute force attacks against 59 bits. 
   Since Birthday attack is a well-known attacks on hash functions and 
   CGA value is also the hash of some values, the attacker only needs to 
   do 2^(n/2) ~= 2^(29.5) brute force attack against the CGA node where 
   n is the number of bits. In [ugbits], relax the use of these bits. 
   However, in CGA mixed mode environment these bits have a meaning and 
   shows whether the node uses CGA or other approaches but we can also 
   consider the use of these bits. So, the value would be 
   2^(30.5+sec*16). 

   To complicate this process, CGA algorithm make use of the sec value 
   and check the condition of 16*sec value that should be equal to zero. 
   This presumed to be a way to complicate the brute force attacks and 
   expand the brute force search to 2^(29.5+ sec*16) possible values. 
   Unfortunately this is not true and this condition only complicates 
   the IP address generation process and reduces the performance for the 
   legitimate CGA node and not for the attacker. The attacker always 
   uses CGA sec value 0, SHA-1 algorithm. 

   The reasons are as follow: 

   - No comparision of source address with target address 

   Based on the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) specification on 
   section 7 RFC 4861 [RFC4861, RFC4862], there is nothing about to 
   check the source IP address with the target address. 

   - CGA verifier node ignores the 3 bits sec value 

   Based on NDP specification, the verifier node checkes to see whether 
   or not the target address is the same as its own IP address. If it is

   the same and the node supports CGA, then it starts CGA verification. 
   Based on step 4 section 5 RFC 3972, the CGA node compares the source 
   address (IID section) of the sender node to his own IID. The verifier 
   node ignores 3 bits sec value. So, the attacker can set the target 
   address to the real CGA address of the victim node disregard its sec 
   value and set the source address to his own CGA value that is only 
   different in the 3 leftmost bits. Since the verification is 
   successful, the attacker can spoof the IP address of CGA node. 

   - Either conflict on the network or the CGA node waive his rights on 
   the IP address 

   The attacker node can persist on his own IP address after a 
   successful verification by CGA node and either force CGA node to 
   generate a new IP address and again the attacker repeats this process 
   or there will be duplicate addresses on the network which cause many 
   services in the victim network stop working. This is because all the 
   nodes verify this attacker node the same way as the legitimate CGA 
   node processed the verification. From their aspects, these two nodes 
   are the same. 

   - The lower limit for key size is 384 bits 

   The attacker does not need to worry about attack on public key and he 
   can choose the lowest size public key so that he can better play with 
   the RSA values and easier and faster generates the similar hash of 
   the CGA node. 

   - Modifier can be zero 

   The attacker does not need to generate a really good random value. 
   Since for him it is only important to match the hash value. This is 
   especially true for the scenario where the attacker needs to do brute 
   force attacks against all 64 bits and sec value is not ignored. 

   

   In the following subsections, some of these attacks are explained in 
   more detail. 



2.1.  Duplicate Address Detection Process 

   When a node generates his IP address, it process the DAD in order to 
   avoid collision on the network. The attacker might be able to 
   generate the CGA value the same of the legitimate CGA node and claim 
   the ownership of that IP address. The CGA nodes only tries 3 times 
   and then it give up. This is not limited to DAD process since 
   whenever the attacker is successful in generating the same value of 
   any of the CGA node in the network, he can force the CGA node to 
   waive his rights as we explained in earlier section of this draft.

2.2.  Nodes communications 

   When two nodes want to start communication, they try to find the IP 
   address of eachother by sending multicast NS/NA messages. If the 
   attacker can generate the CGA of one of these nodes, he can spoof the 
   identity. This is what against the CGA goal.
