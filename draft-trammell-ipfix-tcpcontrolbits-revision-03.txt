Internet-Draft            IPFIX tcpControlBits            September 2013


1.  Introduction

   Octets 12 and 13 of the TCP header encode the data offset (header
   length) in four bits, as well as 12 bits of flags.  The least
   significant 6 bits of these were defined in [RFC0793] as URG, ACK,
   PSH, RST, SYN, and FIN for TCP control.  Subsequently, [RFC3168]
   defined the CWR and ECE flags for Explicit Congestion Notification
   (ECN) negotiation and signaling; [RFC3540] additionally defined the
   NS flag for the ECN Nonce Sum.

   As defined in the IANA IPFIX Information Element Registry
   [IANA-IPFIX], taken from [RFC5102], the tcpControlBits Information
   Element for IPFIX [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol-rfc5101bis] only covers
   the original six bits from [RFC0793].  To allow IPFIX to be used to
   measure the use of ECN, and to bring the IPFIX Information Element
   definition in line with the current definition of the TCP Flags
   header field, it is necessary to revise this definition.

   The revised definition of the Information Element in Section 2 was
   developed and approved through the IE-DOCTORS process
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-ie-doctors] in August 2013.  Section 5.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-ie-doctors] states "This process should not in any
   way be construed as allowing the IE-DOCTORS to overrule IETF
   consensus.  Specifically, Information Elements in the IANA IE
   registry which were added with IETF consensus require IETF consensus
   for revision or deprecation".  Since the tcpControlBits Information
   Element was defined in [RFC5102], an IETF Proposed Standard, any
   revision of this Information Element definition requires IETF
   Consensus.  The publication of this document fulfills that
   requirement.

   The following section defines the revised tcpControlBits Information
   Element as in Section 9.1 of [I-D.ietf-ipfix-ie-doctors].

2.  The tcpControlBits Information Element

   ElementId:   6
   Data Type:   unsigned16
   Data Type Semantics:   flags
   Description:   TCP control bits observed for the packets of this
      Flow.  This information is encoded as a bit field; for each TCP
      control bit, there is a bit in this set.  The bit is set to 1 if
      any observed packet of this Flow has the corresponding TCP control
      bit set to 1.  The bit is cleared to 0 otherwise.

      The values of each bit are shown below, per the definition of the
      bits in the TCP header [RFC0793]:

      As the most significant four bits of octets 12 and 13 of the TCP
      header [RFC0793] are used to encode the TCP data offset (header
      length), the corresponding bits in this IE must be exported as
      zero and must be ignored by the collector; use the tcpHeaderLength
      Information Element to encode this value.

      Each of the three future use bits (0x800, 0x400, and 0x200) should
      be exported as observed in the TCP headers of the packets of this
      Flow, as they may be used subsequent to a future update of
      [RFC0793].

      If exported as a single octet with reduced size encoding, this
      Information Element covers the low-order octet of this field (i.e,
      bits 0x80 to 0x01), omitting the ECN Nonce Sum and the three
      Future Use bits.  A collector receiving this Information Element
      with reduced size encoding must not assume anything about the
      content of these four bits.

      Exporting Processes exporting this Information Element on behalf
      of a Metering Process that is not capable of observing any of the
      ECN Nonce Sum or Future Use bits should use reduced size encoding,
      and only export the least significant 8 bits of this Information
      Element.

      Note that previous revisions of this Information Element's
      definition specified that the CWR and ECE bits must be exported as
      zero, even if observed.  Collectors should therefore not assume
      that a value of zero for these bits in this Information Element
      indicates the bits were never set in the observed traffic,
      especially if these bits are zero in every Flow Record sent by a
      given exporter.

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA will update the definition of the tcpControlBits Information
   Element in the the IANA IPFIX Information Element Registry
   [IANA-IPFIX] to reflect the changes in Section 2 above.

4.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   This document has no security or privacy considerations; the security
   considerations for IPFIX [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol-rfc5101bis] apply.
