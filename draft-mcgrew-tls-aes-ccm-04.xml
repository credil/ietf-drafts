<section title="Introduction">
  
  <t>This document describes the use of Advanced Encryption Standard
  (AES) <xref target="AES"></xref> in Counter with CBC-MAC Mode (CCM)
  <xref target="CCM"></xref> in several TLS ciphersuites.  AES-CCM
  provides both authentication and confidentiality and uses as its
  only primitive the AES encrypt operation (the AES decrypt operation
  is not needed).  This makes it amenable to compact implementations,
  which is advantageous in constrained environments.  Of course,
  adoption outside of constrained environments is necessary to enable
  interoperability, such as that between web clients and embedded
  servers, or between embedded clients and web servers.  The use of
  AES-CCM has been specified for IPsec ESP <xref
  target="RFC4309"></xref> and 802.15.4 wireless networks <xref
  target="IEEE802154"></xref>.
</t>

<t>
  Authenticated encryption, in addition to providing confidentiality
  for the plaintext that is encrypted, provides a way to check its
  integrity and authenticity.  Authenticated Encryption with
  Associated Data, or AEAD <xref target="RFC5116"/>, adds the ability
  to check the integrity and authenticity of some associated data that
  is not encrypted.  This note utilizes the AEAD facility within TLS
  1.2 <xref target="RFC5246"></xref> and the AES-CCM-based AEAD
  algorithms defined in <xref target="RFC5116"/>.  Additional AEAD
  algorithms are defined, which use AES-CCM but which have shorter
  authentication tags, and therefore are more suitable for use across
  networks in which bandwidth is constrained and message sizes may be
  small.
</t>
<t>
The ciphersuites defined in this document use RSA or Pre-Shared Key
(PSK) as their key establishment mechanism; these ciphersuites can be
used with DTLS <xref target="RFC6347"></xref>.  Since the abiltiy
to use AEAD ciphers was introduced in DTLS version 1.2, the ciphersuites
defined in this note cannot be used with earlier versions of that protocol.

		<t>he key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
   in <xref target="RFC2119"></xref></t>
		</section>

		<section title="RSA Based AES-CCM Cipher Suites" anchor="rsasuite">
			<t>The ciphersuites defined in this document
			are based on the the AES-CCM authenticated
			encryption with associated data (AEAD)
			algorithms AEAD_AES_128_CCM and
			AEAD_AES_256_CCM described
			in <xref target="RFC5116"></xref>.
			  
			The following RSA-based ciphersuites are defined:</t>
				<t><list style="hanging" >
					<t>
					  CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM     = {TBD1,TBD1}<vspace></vspace>
					  CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CCM     = {TBD2,TBD2)<vspace></vspace>
					  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM = {TBD3,TBD3}<vspace></vspace>
					  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CCM = {TBD4,TBD4}<vspace></vspace>
					  CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8     = {TBD5,TBD5}<vspace></vspace>
					  CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CCM_8     = {TBD6,TBD6)<vspace></vspace>
					  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8 = {TBD7,TBD7}<vspace></vspace>
					  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CCM_8 = {TBD8,TBD8}
					</t>
				</list></t>
<t>These ciphersuites make use of the AEAD capability in TLS
1.2 <xref target="RFC5246"></xref>.  
Each uses AES-CCM; those that end in "_8" have an 8-octet authentication tag,
while the other ciphersuites have 16-octet authentication tags.
</t>
<t>

  The HMAC truncation option described in Section 7 of
  <xref target="RFC6066"/> (which negotiates the "truncated_hmac" TLS
  extension) does not have an effect on cipher suites that do not use
  HMAC.
</t>
<t>
The "nonce" input to the AEAD algorithm is exactly that of
<xref target="RFC5288"/>: the "nonce" SHALL be 12 bytes long and
is constructed as follows:
</t>

<figure >
	<artwork  align="center">
struct {
   case client:
      uint32 client_write_IV;  // low order 32-bits
   case server:
      uint32 server_write_IV;  // low order 32-bits
   uint64 seq_num;
} CCMNonce.</artwork>
</figure>
		<t>In DTLS, the 64-bit seq_num is the 16-bit epoch concatenated with the
		  48-bit seq_num.</t>

  <t>These ciphersuites make use of the default TLS 1.2 Pseudorandom
    Function (PRF), which uses HMAC with the SHA-256 hash
    function. The RSA and RSA-DHE key exchange is performed as defined
    in <xref target="RFC5246"></xref>.
  </t>

		</section>

		<section title="PSK Based AES-CCM Cipher Suites" anchor="psksuite">
			<t>As in Section <xref target="rsasuite"></xref>, 
			these ciphersuites follow <xref target="RFC5116"></xref>.
			The PSK and DHE_PSK key exchange is performed as in <xref target="RFC4279"/>.
			The following ciphersuites are defined:</t>
				<t><list style="hanging" >
					<t>
					  CipherSuite TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM       = {TBD9,TBD9}<vspace></vspace>
					  CipherSuite TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CCM       = {TBD10,TBD10)<vspace></vspace>
					  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM   = {TBD11,TBD11}<vspace></vspace>
					  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CCM   = {TBD12,TBD12}<vspace></vspace>
					  CipherSuite TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8     = {TBD13,TBD13}<vspace></vspace>

The "nonce" input to the AEAD
algorithm is defined as in Section <xref target="rsasuite"></xref>.  	
</t>
  <t>These ciphersuites make use of the default TLS 1.2 Pseudorandom
    Function (PRF), which uses HMAC with the SHA-256 hash
    function. The PSK and PSK-DHE key exchange is performed as defined
    in <xref target="RFC5487"></xref>.
  </t>

		</section>

		<section title="TLS Versions">
<t>These ciphersuites make use of the authenticated encryption with
additional data (AEAD) defined in TLS 1.2 <xref
target="RFC5288"></xref>.  Earlier versions of TLS do not have support
for AEAD; for instance, the TLSCiphertext structure does not have the
"aead" option in TLS 1.1.  Consequently, these ciphersuites MUST NOT be
negotiated in older versions of TLS.  Clients MUST NOT offer these
cipher suites if they do not offer TLS 1.2 or later.  Servers which
select an earlier version of TLS MUST NOT select one of these cipher
suites.  Because TLS has no way for the client to indicate that it
supports TLS 1.2 but not earlier, a non-compliant server might
potentially negotiate TLS 1.1 or earlier and select one of the cipher
suites in this document.  Clients MUST check the TLS version and
generate a fatal "illegal_parameter" alert if they detect an incorrect
version.</t>

   The AEAD_AES_128_CCM_8 authenticated encryption algorithm is

   AEAD_AES_128_CCM.  The AEAD_AES_128_CCM_8 ciphertext consists of
   the ciphertext output of the CCM encryption operation concatenated
   with the 8-octet authentication tag output of the CCM encryption
   operation.  Test cases are provided in [CCM].  The input and output
