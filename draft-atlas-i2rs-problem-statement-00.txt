           Interface to the Routing System Problem Statement
                 draft-atlas-i2rs-problem-statement-01

Abstract

   As modern networks grow in scale and complexity, the need for rapid
   and dynamic control increases.  With scale, the need to automate even
   the simplest operations is important, but even more critical is the
   ability to quickly interact with more complex operations such as
   policy-based controls.

   In order to enable applications to have access to and control over
   information in the Internet's routing system, we need a publicly
   documented interface specification.  The interface needs to support
   real-time, transaction-based interactions using data models and
   encodings that are efficient and potentially different from those
   available today.  Furthermore, the interface must be tailored to
   support a variety of use cases.

   This document expands upon these statements of requirements to
   provide a detailed problem statement for an Interface to the Internet
   Routing System (I2RS).

1.  Introduction

   As modern networks grow in scale and complexity, the need for rapid
   and dynamic control increases.  With scale, the need to automate even
   the simplest operations is important, but even more critical is the
   ability to quickly interact with more complex operations such as
   policy-based controls.

   With complexity comes the need for more sophisticated automated
   applications and orchestration software that can process large
   quantities of data, run complex algorithms, and adjust the routing
   state as required in order to support the applications, their
   calculations and their policies.  Changes made to the routing state
   of a network by external applications must be verifiable by those
   applications to ensure that the correct state has been installed in
   the right places.

   Mechanisms to support the requirements outlined above have been
   developed piecemeal as proprietary solutions to specific situations
   and needs.  A standard protocol, clearly defined operations that an
   application can initiate with that protocol, and data-models to
   support such actions would facilitate wide-scale deployment of
   interoperable applications and routing systems.  That a protocol
   designed to facilitate rapid, isolated, secure, and dynamic routing
   changes is needed motivates the creation of an Interface to The
   Routing System (I2RS).


2.  I2RS Model and Problem Area for The IETF

   Managing a network of deployed devices running a variety of routing
   protocols involves interactions among multiple different components
   that exist within the network.  Some of these components are virtual
   while some are physical; all should be made available to be managed
   and manipulated by applications, given that appropriate access,
   authentication, and policy hurdles have been crossed.  The management
   of only some of these components requires standardization, as others
   have already been standardized.  The I2RS model is intended to
   incorporate existing mechanisms where appropriate, and to build
   extensions and new protocols where needed.  The I2RS model and
   problem area proposed for IETF work is illustrated in Figure 1.  The
   I2RS Agent is associated with a routing element, which may or may not
   be co-located with a data-plane.  The I2RS Client is used and
   controlled by a network application; they may be co-located or the
   I2RS Client might be part of a separate application, such as an
   orchestrator or controller.

                   Figure 1: I2RS model and Problem Area

   A critical aspect of I2RS is defining a suitable protocol or
   protocols to carry messages between the I2RS Clients and the I2RS
   Agent, and defining the encapsulation of data within those messages.
   This should provide a clear transfer syntax that is straightforward
   for applications to use (e.g., a Web Services design paradigm), and
   should provide the key features specified in Section 5.

   The second critical aspect is semantic-aware data-models for
   information in the routing system and in a topology database.  The
   data-models should be separable across different features of the
   managed components, versioned, and combine to provide a network data-
   model.


3.  Standard Data-Models of Routing State for Installation

   There is a need to be able to precisely control routing and signaling
   state based upon policy or external measures.  This can range from
   simple static routes to policy-based routing to static multicast
   replication and routing state.  This means that, to usefully model
   next-hops, the data model employed needs to handle indirection as
   well as different types of tunneling and encapsulation.  The relevant
   MIB modules (for example [RFC4292]) lack the necessary generality and
   flexibility.  In addition, by having I2RS focus initially on
   interfaces to the RIB layer (e.g.  RIB, LFIB, multicast RIB, policy-
   based routing), the ability to use routing indirection allows
   flexibility and functionality that can't be as easily obtained at the
   forwarding layer.

   Efforts to provide this level of control have focused on
   standardizing data models that describe the forwarding plane (e.g.
   ForCES [RFC3746]).  I2RS posits that the routing system and a
   router's OS provide useful mechanisms that applications could
   usefully harness to accomplish application-level goals.

   In addition to interfaces to the RIB layer, there is a need to
   configure the various routing and signaling protocols with differing
   dynamic state based upon application-level policy decisions.  The
   range desired is not available via MIBs at the present time.


4.  Learning Router Information

   A router has information that applications may require so that they
   can understand the network, verify that programmed state is installed
   in the forwarding plane, measure the behavior of various flows, and

Internet-Draft           I2RS Problem Statement            February 2013


   understand the existing configuration and state of the router.  I2RS
   provides a framework for applications to register for asynchronous
   notifications and for them to make specific requests for information.

   Although there are efforts to extend the topological information
   available, even the best of these (e.g., BGP-LS
   [I-D.gredler-idr-ls-distribution]) still provides only the current
   active state as seen at the IGP layer and above.  Detailed
   topological state that provides more information than the current
   functional status is needed by applications; only the active paths or
   links are known versus those potentially available or unknown to the
   routing topology.

   For applications to have a feedback loop that includes awareness of
   the relevant traffic, an application must be able to request the
   measurement and timely, scalable reporting of data.  While a
   mechanism such as IPFIX [RFC5470] may be the facilitator for
   delivering the data, the need for an application to be able to
   dynamically request that measurements be taken and data delivered is
   critical.

   There are a wide range of events that applications could use for
   either verification of router state before other network state is
   changed (e.g. that a route has been installed), to act upon changes
   to relevant routes by others, or upon router events (e.g. link up/
   down).  While a few of these (e.g. link up/down) may be available via
   MIB Notifications today, the full range is not - nor is there the
   standardized ability to set up the router to trigger different
   actions upon an event's occurrence.


5.  Desired Aspects of a Protocol for I2RS

   This section describes required aspects of a protocol that could
   support I2RS.  Whether such a protocol is built upon extending
   existing mechanisms or requires a new mechanism requires further
   investigation.

   The key aspects needed in an interface to the routing system are:

   Multiple Simultaneous Asynchronous Operations:   A single application
      should be able to send multiple operations to I2RS without needing
      to wait for each to complete before sending the next.

   Very Fine Granularity of Data Locking for Writing:   When an I2RS
      operation is processed, it is required that the data locked for
      writing is very granular (e.g. a particular prefix and route)
      rather than extremely coarse, as is done for writing



Atlas, et al.            Expires August 25, 2013                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           I2RS Problem Statement            February 2013


      configuration.  This should improve the number of concurrent I2RS
      operations that are feasible and reduce blocking delays.

   Multi-Headed Control:   Multiple applications may communicate to the
      same I2RS agent in a minimally coordinated fashion.  It is
      necessary that the I2RS agent can handle multiple conflicting
      requests in a well-known policy-based fashion.  Data written can
      be owned by different I2RS clients.

   Duplex:   Communications can be established by either the router or
      the application.  Similarly, events, acknowledgements, failures,
      operations, etc. can be sent at any time by both the router and
      the application.  The I2RS is not a pure pull-model where only the
      application queries to pull responses.

   High-Throughput:   At a minimum, the I2RS Agent and associated router
      should be able to handle hundreds of simple operations per second.

   Responsive:   It should be possible to complete simple operations
      within a sub-second time-scale.

   Multi-Channel:   It should be possible for information to be
      communicated via the interface from different components in the
      router without requiring going through a single channel.  For
      example, for scaling, some exported data or events may be better
      sent directly from the forwarding plane, while other interactions
      may come from the control-plane.  Thus a single TCP session would
      not be a good match.

   Temporal State for Installation and Expiration:   The ability to have
      state installed with different lifetimes and different start-times
      is very valuable.  In particular, the ability of an I2RS client to
      request that a pre-sent operation be started based upon a dynamic
      event would provide a powerful functionality.

   Scalable, Filterable Information Access:  To extract information in a
      scalable fashion that is more easily used by applications, the
      ability to specify filtering constructs in an operation requesting
      data or requesting an asynchronous notification is very valuable.


6.  Existing Management Interfaces

   This section discusses as a single entity the combination of the
   abstract data models, their representation in a data language, and
   the transfer protocol commonly used with them.  While other
   combinations are possible, the ways described are those that have
   significant deployment.

Internet-Draft           I2RS Problem Statement            February 2013


   There are three basic ways that routers are managed.  The most
   popular is the command line interface (CLI), which allows both
   configuration and learning of device state.  This is a proprietary
   interface resembling a UNIX shell that allows for very customized
   control and observation of a device, and, specifically of interest in
   this case, its routing system.  Some form of this interface exists on
   almost every device (virtual or otherwise).  Processing of
   information returned to the CLI (called "screen scraping") is a
   burdensome activity because the data is normally formatted for use by
   a human operator, and because the layout of the data can vary from
   device to device, and between different software versions.  Despite
   its ubiquity, this interface has never been standardized and is
   unlikely to ever be standardized.  I2RS does not involve CLI
   standardization.

   The second most popular interface for interrogation of a device's
   state, statistics, and configuration is The Simple Network Management
   Protocol (SNMP) and a set of relevant standards-based and proprietary
   Management Information Base (MIB) modules.  SNMP has a strong history
   of being used by network managers to gather statistical and state
   information about devices, including their routing systems.  However,
   SNMP is very rarely used to configure a device or any of its systems
   for reasons that vary depending upon the network operator.  Some
   example reasons include complexity, the lack of desired configuration
   semantics (e.g., configuration "roll-back", "sandboxing" or
   configuration versioning), and the difficulty of using the semantics
   (or lack thereof) as defined in the MIB modules to configure device
   features.  Therefore, SNMP is not considered as a candidate solution
   for the problems motivating I2RS.

   Finally, the IETF's Network Configuration (or NetConf) protocol has
   made many strides at overcoming most of the limitations around
   configuration that were just described.  However, the lack of
   standard data models have hampered the adoption of NetConf.
   Naturally, I2RS may help define needed information and data models.
   Additional extensions to handle multi-headed control and time-based
   state installation and expiration may need to be added to NetConf
   and/or appropriate data models.

   Security is a key aspect of any protocol that allows state
