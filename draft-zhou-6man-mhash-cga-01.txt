1.  Introduction

   Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs) defined in [RFC3972] is
   a method of binding a public key to an IPv6 address, with the aim of
   providing address ownership in many internet protocols.  In the
   generation and verification of a CGA address, a cryptographicaly
   secure hash function, SHA-1 in the case of [RFC3972], is used to hash
   a public key into part of the neitwork IP address.

   As pointed out in Section 4 of [RFC4982], it is wise to enable
   multiple hash functions support in CGAs so that once the current hash
   function does not satisfy future requirements ,e.g., potential future
   applications of the CGAs may need a more cryptographicaly secure hash
   algorithm than SHA-1, the transition to an alternative hash function
   is as easy as possible.

   To provide a sense of hash algorishms agility , a method of reusing
   the security parameter bits in the address is secified [RFC4982].
   Security parameter , sec, defined in RFC 3972, is a 3 bit value from
   0 to 7 used in the hash extension technique (Section 7.2 in RFC3972
   ), to compensate the truncated SHA-1 output length because of
   insuffient bits space in a CGA address.  According to the method
   specified in RFC4982, the security parameter is also used to
   represent hash algorithm identity:

      000 means sec=0 and SHA-1

      001 means sec=1 and SHA-1

      010 means sec=2 and SHA-1

   Then security parameter is limited to 0,1,2 .  They may be sufficient
   for now, but higher security parameter value may also be required
   with computers becoming faster, as pointed out in Section 7.2 , RFC
   3972.

   Even with limited security parameter value, the method in RFC 4982
   can only support three hash algorithms at most.  That is besides
   SHA-1, we have a second choice of an alternative hash algorithm
   number one with sec=0,1,2 and a third choice of another alternative
   hash algorithm number two with sec can only be two values from
   {0,1,2}.

   Taking the above two factors into consideration, at some time in the
   future we will be faced with a painful choice, high security
   parameter or a more secure hash algorithm?  And we may be also
   challenged with pain of high cost of upgrading because of the massive
   number of IPv6 nodes that may be using CGA addresses.

   In this document, a support for multiple hash algorithms without
   limiting security parameter or downgrading the security level of CGAs
   is provided.  The proposed solution follows the idea of encoding the
   hash algorithm identity in the CGA addresses to prevent from
   downgrading attacks, the detailed decription of downgrading attack
   can be found in Section 4.1, RFC 4982.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Mhash-method Extension

   To accomodate RFC 4982, an extension field "Mhash-method" is defined.
   The format is illustrated in Figure 1.

   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |         Extension Type        |      Extension Length         |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Mhash-method|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Extension Type: TBA. (16-bit unsigned integer).

   Extension Data Length: 1. (16-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the
   multiple-hash-method field of this option, in octets.)

   Mhash-method: 1 octet length field.  If Mhash-method equal 0, it
   means the method of denoting hash algorithm specified in RFC 4982 is
   adopted, if Mhash-method equal 1, it means the method specified in
   this document is adopted.


3.  Hash Algorithm Identity Parameter

   A hash algorithm identity parameter (hid) in CGA is defiend to denote
   the hash algorithm adopted when caculating HASH1 and HASH2.  The hash
   algorithm identity parameter is a three-bit unsigned integer, and it
   is encoded in the 3rd-5th bits of the interface identifier.  This can
   be written as follows:

   hid = (interface identifier & 0x1c00000000000000) >> 58

4.  CGA Generation Procedure

   Generate a CGA as defined in RFC 3972 except some modification to
   steps 2,3,5,6 and 9 as shown in the following:

   1.  Set the modifier to a random or pseudo-random 128-bit value.

   2.  Concatenate from left to right the modifier, 9 zero octets, the
       encoded public key, and any optional extension fields.  Execute
       the adopted hash algorithm ( denoted by value of hid) on the
       concatenation.  Take the 112( or 115 in case sec=7 ) leftmost
       bits of the hash value.  The result is Hash2.

   3.  Compare the 16*Sec+3 leftmost bits of Hash2 with zero.  If they
       are all zero, continue with step 4.  Otherwise, increment the
       modifier by one and go back to step 2.

   4.  Set the 8-bit collision count to zero.

   5.  Concatenate from left to right the final modifier value, the
       subnet prefix, the collision count, the encoded public key, and
       any optional extension fields.  Execute the adopted hash
       algorithm on the concatenation.  Take the 56 leftmost bits of the
       hash value.  The result is Hash1.

   6.  Form an interface identifier from Hash1 by writing the value of
       Sec into the three leftmost bits, writing teh value of hid into
       the following three bits and by setting bits 6 and 7 (i.e., the
       "u" and "g" bits) to zero.

   7.  Concatenate the 64-bit subnet prefix and the 64-bit interface
       identifier to form a 128-bit IPv6 address with the subnet prefix
       to the left and interface identifier to the right, as in a
       standard IPv6 address .

   8.  Perform duplicate address detection if required.  If an address
       collision is detected, increment the collision count by one and
       go back to step 5.  However, after three collisions, stop and
       report the error.

   9.  Form the CGA Parameters data structure by concatenating from left
       to right the final modifier value, the subnet prefix, the final

       collision count value, the encoded public key, Mhash-method value
       (equal 1 in this case) and any other optional extension fields.


5.  CGA Verification Procedure

   Veirfy a CGA as defined in RFC 3972 except some modification to steps
   3,4,6 and 7 as shown in the following:

   1.  Check that the collision count in the CGA Parameters data
       structure is 0, 1, or 2.  The CGA verification fails if the
       collision count is out of the valid range.

   2.  Check that the subnet prefix in the CGA Parameters data structure
       is equal to the subnet prefix (i.e., the leftmost 64 bits) of the
       address.  The CGA verification fails if the prefix values differ.

   3.  if the Mhash-method value in the Mhash-method extenstion filed is
       1, read the hash algorithm identity parameter hid from the 3rd-
       5th bits of the 64-bit interface identifier of the address,
       execute the hash algorithm denoted by hid on the CGA Parameters
       data structure.  Take the 56 leftmost bits of the hash value.
       The result is Hash1.  If the Mhash-method value in the Mhash-
       method extenstion filed is 0, do exactly as sepcified in RFC 3972
       and RFC4982.

   4.  Compare Hash1 with the interface identifier (i.e., the rightmost
       56 bits) of the address.  If the 56-bit values differ, the CGA
       verification fails.

   5.  Read the security parameter Sec from the three leftmost bits of
       the 64-bit interface identifier of the address.  (Sec is an
       unsigned 3-bit integer.)

   6.  Concatenate from left to right the modifier, 9 zero octets, the
       public key, and any extension fields that follow the public key
       in the CGA Parameters data structure.  Execute the hash algorithm
       denoted by hid on the concatenation.  Take the 112 (or 115 in
       case sec=7) leftmost bits of the SHA-1 hash value.  The result is
       Hash2.

   7.  Compare the 16*Sec+3 leftmost bits of Hash2 with zero.  If any
       one of them is not zero, the CGA verification fails.  Otherwise,
       the verification succeeds.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines one new CGA Extension Type [RFC4581] option,
   which must be assigned by IANA:

   Name: Mhash-method extension type;

   Value: TBA.

   Description: see Section 2.

   The values of Mhash-method are also defined:

   Name: Mhash-method extension value;

   Value: 0 meaning RFC 4982, 1 meaning this document;

   Description: see Section 2.

   This document also defines a new parameter (hid) in CGA, the value of
   which must be assigned by IANA.  It may be assigned as follows:

             Name        | Value
      -------------------+-------
            SHA-1        |   000
            SHA-244      |   001
            SHA-256      |   010
            SHA-384      |   011
            SHA-512      |   100
            TBD          |   101
            TBD          |   110
            TBD          |   111


7.  Security Considerations

   The security of applications using CGAs relies on the adopted public
   key schemes, which is out of the scope of this document, as well as
   the adopted hash algorithms.

   A high cryptographicaly secure hash algorithm is obviously required.
   But no hash algorithms are guaranteed to be secure for ever, it is
   wise to add algorithm agility into CGAs in case current hash
   algorithm be successfully attacked. .

   This document suggests adding more flexible hash algorithm
   agilibility to CGAs.  The method in this document follows the idea of
   encoding the hash algorithm identifier in the interface identifier to



Zhou, et al.            Expires October 11, 2012                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        draft-zhou-6man-mhash-cga-00            April 2012


   avoid downgrading attack, as analysed in Section 4.1, RFC 4982.

   Actually CGAs only adopt truncated forms of a hash algorithm which is
   considered cryptographicaly secure in the sense of its regular form.
   As specified in RFC 3972, the effective bits relating to the security
   of CGAs are only the leftmost 59 bits (in the case of HASH1) , and
   the left most 16*sec bits (in the case of HASH2) of the whole 160
   bits SHA-1 output .  It is roughly estimated that the overall
   security of the hash algorithm is O( 2^(16*sec+59))(Section 7.2,
   RFC3972).

   In this document, 3 bits originally used for output of HASH1are taken
   off the interface identifier to denote hash algoritm identity, while
   3 more bits of output of HASH2 are checked, in a whole the whole
   security level is kept roughly the same, i.e.,O( 2^(16*sec+59)) .
