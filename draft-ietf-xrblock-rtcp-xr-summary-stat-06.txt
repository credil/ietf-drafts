Internet-Draft           Summary Stats XR Blocks            January 2013


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Summary Statistics Metrics

   This draft defines three new block types to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611] for use in a range of RTP applications.

   The first two block types support the reporting of burst gap loss/
   discard summary statistics including packet loss/discard proportion,
   mean and variance and belong to the class of transport-related end
   system metrics defined in [RFC6792].  These two blocks are intended
   to be used in conjunction with information from the Burst Gap Loss
   Metrics Block or Burst Gap Discard Metrics Block, and on which these
   two block therefore depend.  The metrics in the Burst Gap Loss block
   or Burst Gap Discard Metrics Block can be used independently of the
   metrics defined in the first two blocks.

   The third block supports the reporting of detailed statistics for
   each frame type, including the number of frames received, lost and
   discarded of each frame type in the Group of Pictures (GOP) and
   additional data allowing the calculation of statistical parameters
   (e.g.,the proportion of each frame type impaired by packet loss and
   discard).  The metrics defined in this block belong to the class of
   application layer metrics defined in [RFC6792].

1.2.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]
   defined an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This document defines a new Extended Report block for
   use with [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].

1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework

   The RTP Monitoring Architectures [RFC6792] provides guideline for
   reporting block format using RTCP XR.  Metrics described in this
   draft are in accordance with the guidelines in [RFC6792].

1.4.  Applicability

   These metrics are applicable to a wide range of RTP applications and
   reflect transient IP problems that affect user experience.  They can
   be used to form an accurate assessment of users' quality of
   experience and influence sender strategies to mitigate the problem.

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In addition, the following terms are defined:

   Picture Type

      Picture Types used in the different video algorithms are composed
      of the Key frame and Derived frames.  The Key frame is also called
      a reference frame and used as a reference for predicting other
      pictures.  It is coded without prediction from other pictures.
      Derived frames are derived from a Key frame using a prediction
      algorithm.



3.  Transport Related End System Metrics

3.1.  Burst/Gap Loss Summary Statistics Metrics Block

   The metrics described here are intended to be used as described in
   this section, in conjunction with information from the Measurement
   Information block [RFC6776] (which MUST be present in the same RTCP
   packet as the Burst/Gap Loss block) and also with the metric
   "cumulative number of packets lost" provided in standard RTCP
   [RFC3550].  Instances of this Metrics Block refer by Synchronization
   source (SSRC) to the separate auxiliary Measurement Information block
   [RFC6776] which describes measurement periods in use (see [RFC6776]
   section 4.2).  This Metrics Block relies on the measurement period in
   the Measurement Information block indicating the span of the report
   and SHOULD be sent in the same compound RTCP packet as the
   measurement information block.  If the measurement period is not
   received in the same compound RTCP packet as this Metrics Block, this
   metrics block MUST be discarded.

   The metrics carried in this Metrics Block provide information
   relevant to statistical parameters, including burst loss rate, gap
   loss rate, burst duration mean, burst duration variance and are
   calculated at the receiving end of the RTP stream using burst gap
   loss metrics defined in [BGLOSS] and other information which is sent
   together with this report block.

3.1.2.  Definition of Fields in Loss Summary Statistics Block

   Block Type (BT): 8 bits

      Burst/Gap Loss Summary Statistics Block is identified by the
      constant <BGLSS>.

   Interval Metric Flag (I): 2 bits

      This field is used to indicate whether the Burst/Gap Loss Summary
      Statistics metrics are Sampled, Interval or Cumulative metrics:

         I=10: Interval Duration - the reported value applies to the
         most recent measurement interval duration between successive
         metrics reports.
         I=11: Cumulative Duration - the reported value applies to the
         accumulation period characteristic of cumulative measurements.
         I=01: Sampled Value - the reported value is a sampled
         instantaneous value.
      In this document, the value I=00 is the reserved value and MUST
      NOT be used.

   Reserved: 6 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      SHOULD be ignored by the receiver (See RFC6709 section 4.2).

   Block Length: 16 bits

      The constant 3, in accordance with the definition of this field in
      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

Internet-Draft           Summary Stats XR Blocks            January 2013


   SSRC of Source: 32 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of RFC3611 [RFC3611].

   Burst Loss Rate: 16 bits

      The fraction of packets lost during bursts since the beginning of
      reception, expressed as a fixed point number with the binary point
      at the left edge of the field.  This value is calculated by
      dividing Packets Loss in Bursts by Total Packets expected in
      Bursts as follows:

      Packets Loss in Bursts / Total Packets expected in Bursts

   Gap Loss Rate: 16 bits

      The fraction of packets lost during gaps since the beginning of
      reception expressed as a fixed point number with the binary point
      at the left edge of the field.  This value is calculated by
      dividing the difference between number of packets lost and Packets
      lost in Bursts by the difference between Packets Expected and
      Total Packets expected in Bursts as follows:

      (number of packets lost - Packets Lost in Bursts) / (Packets
      Expected - Total Packets expected in Bursts)

      where "number of packets lost" is obtained from standard RTCP
      [RFC3550] and Packets Expected is calculated as the difference
      between "extended last sequence number" and "extended first
      sequence number" (Interval or Cumulative) provided in the
      Measurement Identity and Information block [RFC6776].

      Note that if the metric is to be calculated on an Interval basis,
      a difference must be taken between the current and preceding
      values of "cumulative number of packets lost" in RTCP, to obtain
      the "number of packets lost" for the reporting interval.

   Burst Duration Mean:16bits

      The mean burst duration is obtained as the quotient:

      mean = Sum of Burst Durations / Number of Bursts

      where "Sum of Burst Durations" and "Number of Bursts" is obtained
      from the RTCP XR Burst/Gap Loss Block [BGLOSS].

Internet-Draft           Summary Stats XR Blocks            January 2013


   Burst Duration Variance:16bits

      The variance of the burst duration is obtained using the standard
      result:

      var = ( Sum of Squares of Burst Durations - Number of Bursts *
      mean^2 ) / (Number of Bursts - 1)

      where "Sum of Squares of Burst Durations" and "Number of Bursts"is
      obtained from the RTCP XR Burst/Gap Loss Block [BGLOSS].


3.2.  Burst/Gap Discard Summary Statistics Metrics Block

   The metrics described here are intended to be used as described in
   this section, in conjunction with information from the Measurement
   Identity block [RFC6776] (which MUST be present in the same RTCP
   packet as the Burst/Gap Discard Summary Statistics block) .

   These metrics provide information relevant to statistical parameters,
   including burst discard rate, gap discard rate and are calculated at
   the receiving end of the RTP stream using burst gap discard metrics
   defined in [BGDISCARD] and other information which is sent together
   with this report block.

   Instances of this Metrics Block refer by Synchronization source
   (SSRC) to the separate auxiliary Measurement Information block
   [RFC6776] which describes measurement periods in use (see [RFC6776]
   section 4.2).  This metrics block relies on the measurement period in
   the Measurement Information block indicating the span of the report
   and SHOULD be sent in the same compound RTCP packet as the
   measurement information block.  If the measurement period is not
   received in the same compound RTCP packet as this Metrics Block, this
   Metrics Block MUST be discarded.

3.2.2.  Definition of Fields in Burst/Gap Discard Summary Statistics
        Block

   Block Type (BT): 8 bits

      Burst/Gap Discard Summary Statistics Block is identified by the
      constant <BGDSS>.

   Interval Metric Flag (I): 2 bits

      This field is used to indicate whether the Burst/Gap Discard
      Summary Statistics metrics are Sampled, Interval or Cumulative
      metrics:

         I=10: Interval Duration - the reported value applies to the
         most recent measurement interval duration between successive
         metrics reports.
         I=11: Cumulative Duration - the reported value applies to the
         accumulation period characteristic of cumulative measurements.
         I=01: Sampled Value - the reported value is a sampled
         instantaneous value.


      In this document, the value I=00 is the reserved value and MUST
      NOT be used.

   Reserved: 6 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      SHOULD be ignored by the receiver (See RFC6709 section 4.2).

   Block Length: 16 bits

      The constant 2, in accordance with the definition of this field in
      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   SSRC of Source: 32 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of RFC3611 [RFC3611].

   Burst Discard Rate: 16 bits

      The fraction of packets discarded during bursts since the
      beginning of reception, expressed as a fixed point number with the
      binary point at the left edge of the field.  This value is
      calculated by dividing Packets Discarded in Bursts by Total
      Packets expected in Bursts as follows:

Internet-Draft           Summary Stats XR Blocks            January 2013


      Packets Discarded in Bursts / Total Packets expected in Bursts

   Gap Discard Rate: 16 bits

      The fraction of packets discarded during gaps since the beginning
      of reception expressed as a fixed point number with the binary
      point at the left edge of the field.  This value is calculated by
      dividing the difference between number of packets discarded and
      Packets Discarded in Bursts by the difference between Packets
      Expected and Total Packets expected in Bursts as follows:

      (number of packets discarded - Packets Discarded in Bursts) /
      (Packets Expected - Total Packets expected in Bursts)

      where "number of packets discarded" is obtained from the RTCP XR
      Discard Count Block [DISCARD] and filled with the sum of packets
      discarded due to early arrival (DT=1) and packets discarded due to
      late arrival(DT=2) and Packets Expected is calculated as the
      difference between "extended last sequence number" and "extended
      first sequence number" (Interval or Cumulative) provided in the
      Measurement Information block [RFC6776].  In order for the Burst/
      Gap Discard Summary Statistics Block to be meaningful, 2 instances
      of the Discard Count block with DT=1 and DT=2 MUST be included in
      the same RTCP XR packet as the Burst/Gap Discard Summary
      Statistics Block.


4.  Application Level Metrics

4.1.  Frame Impairment Statistics Summary Metrics Block

   This block reports statistics on which frame type were affected
   beyond the information carried in the Statistics Summary Report Block
   RTCP packet specified in the section 4.6 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].
   Information is measured at the receiving end of the RTP stream and
   recorded about the number of frames received, lost frames, duplicated
   frames and lost partial frames.  Such information can be useful for
   network management and video quality monitoring.

4.1.2.  Definition of Fields in Frame Impairment Summary Statistics
        Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      Frame Impairment Statistics Summary Block is identified by the
      constant <FISS>.

   Picture type indicator (T): 1 bit

      This field is used to indicate the frame type to be reported.  The
      bit is set to 0 if the lost_full_frames, lost_partial_frames and
      dup_frames fields contain Key frame (reference frame) counts or 1
      if they contain Derived frame counts.  Note that if both the Key
      frame and Derivation frame report are sent, they should be sent in
      the same RTCP compound packet using two Frame Impairment Summary
      Statistics Blocks.

   Reserved: 7 bits

      This field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of
      such a definition, the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and
      SHOULD be ignored by the receiver.

Internet-Draft           Summary Stats XR Blocks            January 2013


   Block Length: 16 bits

      The constant 7, in accordance with the definition of this field in
      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   SSRC of Source: 32 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of RFC3611 [RFC3611].

   Begin_seq: 16 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   end_seq: 16 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].

   Number of frames received:32 bits

      A count of the number of frames received in the above sequence
      number interval, estimated if necessary.  If no frames have been
      received then this count SHALL be set to zero.

   Number of discarded frames (discarded_frames): 32 bits

      Number of frames discarded in the above sequence number interval.

   Number of duplicate frames (dup_frames): 32 bits

      Number of duplicate frames received in the above sequence number
      interval.

   Number of full frames lost (lost_full_frames): 32 bits

      If one frame is completely lost, this frame is regarded as one
      lost full frame.  The lost_full_frames is equivalent to the number
      of full frames lost in the above sequence number interval.

   Number of partial frames lost (lost_partial_frames): 32 bits

      If one frame is partially lost, this frame is regarded as one lost
      fractional frame.  The value of the lost_partial_frames field is
      equivalent to the number of partial frames lost in the above
      sequence number interval.

5.  SDP Signaling

   RFC 3611 defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol)
   [RFC4566] for signaling the use of XR blocks.  However XR blocks MAY
   be used without prior signaling (see section 5 of RFC3611).

5.1.  SDP rtcp-xr-attrib Attribute Extension

   This section augments the SDP [RFC4566] attribute "rtcp-xr" defined
   in Section 5.1 of RFC 3611 by providing three additional values of
   "xr-format" to signal the use of the report block defined in this
   document.

            xr-format = / burst-gap-loss-stat
                        / burst-gap-discard-stat
                        / frame-impairment-stat
    Burst-gap-loss-stat ="burst gap loss summary statistics"
    Burst-gap-discard-stat="burst gap discard summary statistics"
    Frame-impairment-stat="frame impairment summary statistics"

5.2.  Offer/Answer Usage

   When SDP is used in offer-answer context, the SDP Offer/Answer usage
   defined in [RFC3611] for unilateral "rtcp-xr" attribute parameters
   applies.  For detailed usage of Offer/Answer for unilateral
   parameter, refer to section 5.2 of [RFC3611].


6.  IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.  For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to RFC
   3611.

6.1.  New RTCP XR Block Type values

   This document assigns three new block type value in the "RTP Control
   Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) Block Type Registry" :

6.2.  New RTCP XR SDP Parameters

   This document also registers three new SDP [RFC4566] parameters for
   the "rtcp-xr" attribute in the " RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended
   Report (XR) SDP Parameters Registry ":

    *  " burst-gap-loss-stat "
    *  " burst-gap-discard-stat "
    *  " frame-impairment-stat "

6.3.  Contact information for registrations

   The contact information for the registrations is:
