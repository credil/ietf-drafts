1.  Introduction

   An Embedded Experience Document is a component of the OpenSocial Core
   Gadget Specification as defined in section C.15 of [OpenSocial].
   This Internet Draft defines and registers the MIME Media Types for
   the JSON and XML forms of the Embedded Experience Document.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119]


3.  Embedded Experience XML Documents

   An Embedded Experience Document, when serialized as XML 1.0, can be
   identified with the following media type:

      Type name: application
      Subtype name: embed+xml
      Required parameters: None.
      Optional parameters:
        "charset": This parameter has smantics identical
          to the charset parameter of the "application/xml"
          media type as specified in [RFC3023].
      Encoding considerations:
        Identical to those of "application/xml" as described
        in [RFC3023], Section 3.2.
      Security considerations:
        As defined in this specification. In addition, as this
        media type uses the "+xml" convention, it shares the
        same security considerations as described in [RFC3023],
        Section 10.
      Interoperability considerations:
        There are no known interoperability issues.
      Published specification:
        This specification.
      Applications that use this media type:
        OpenSocial 2.0 (http://opensocial.org)
        Apache Shindig (http://shindig.apache.org)
      Additional information:
        Magic number(s):
          As specified for "application/xml" in [RFC3023],
          Section 3.2.
        File extension(s):
          .embed
        Macintosh file type code(s):
          TEXT

4.  Embedded Experience JSON Documents

   An Embedded Experience Document, when serialized as JSON, can be
   identified with the following media type:

      Required parameters:
        None.
      Optional parameters:
        None.
      Encoding considerations:
        Identical to those of "application/json" as described
        in [RFC4627], Section 6.
      Security considerations:
        As defined in this specification. In addition, as
        this media type uses the "+json" convention, it
        shares the same security considerations as described
        in [RFC4627], Section 6.
      Interoperability considerations:
        There are no known interoperability issues.
