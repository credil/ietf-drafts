Internet-Draft                Bundled media                  August 2012


1.  Introduction

   In the IETF RTCWEB WG, a need to use a single 5-tuple for sending and
   receiving media associated with multiple SDP media descriptions ("m="
   lines) has been identified.  This would e.g. allow the usage of a
   single set of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) [RFC5245]
   candidates for multiple media descriptions.  Normally different media
   types (audio, video etc) will be described using different media
   descriptions.

   This specification defines a new SDP Grouping Framework SDP grouping
   framework [RFC5888] extension, "BUNDLE", that can be used with the
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer mechanism [RFC3264]
   to negotiate the usage of bundled media, which refers to the usage of
   a single 5-tuple for media associated with multiple SDP media
   descriptions ("m=" lines).

   When an endpoint generates an SDP Offer or SDP Answer [RFC3264],
   which includes a "BUNDLE" group, each "m=" line associated with the
   group will share a single port number value.

   As defined in RFC 4566 [RFC4566], the semantics of multiple "m="
   lines using the same port number value are undefined, and there is no
   grouping defined by such means.  Instead, an explicit grouping
   mechanism needs to be used to express the intended semantics.  This
   specification provides such extension.

   When media is transported using the Real-Time Protocol (RTP)
   [RFC3550], the default assumption of the mechanism is that all media
   associated with a "BUNDLE" group will form a single RTP Session
   [RFC3550].  However, future specifications can extend the mechanism,
   in order to negotiate RTP Session multiplexing, i.e.  "BUNDLE" groups
   where media associated with a group form multiple RTP Sessions.

   The mechanism is backward compatible.  Entities that do not support
   the "BUNDLE" grouping extension, or do not want to enable the
   mechanism for a given session, are expected to generate a "normal"
   SDP Answer, using different port number values for each "m=" line, to
   the SDP Offer.  The SDP Offerer [RFC3264] will still use a single
   port number value for each media, but as the SDP Answerer [RFC3264]
   will use separate ports a single 5-tuple will not be used for media
   associated with multiple "m=" lines between the endpoints.

   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   5-tuple: A collection of the following values: source address, source
   port, destination address, destination port and protocol.

   Bundled media: Two or more RTP streams using a single 5-tuple.  The
   RTCP streams associated with the RTP streams also use a single
   5-tuple, which might be the same, but can also be different, as the
   one used by the RTP streams.


3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


4.  Applicability Statement

   The mechanism in this specification only applies to the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566], when used together with the SDP
   Offer/Answer mechanism [RFC3264].


5.  SDP Grouping Framework BUNDLE Extension Semantics

   This section defines a new SDP Grouping Framework extension,
   "BUNDLE".

   The "BUNDLE" extension can be indicated using an SDP session-level
   'group' attribute.  Each SDP media description ("m=" line) that is
   grouped together, using an SDP media-level 'mid' attribute, is part
   of a specific "BUNDLE" group.


6.  SDP Offer/Answer Procedures

6.1.  General

   When an SDP Offerer or SDP Answerer generates an SDP Offer or SDP
   Answer, that describes bundled media, it MUST insert an SDP session-
   level 'group' attribute, with a "BUNDLE" value, and assign SDP media-
   level 'mid' attribute values to each "m=" line associated with the
   "BUNDLE" group.

   In addition, the entity that generates the SDP Offer or SDP Answer



Holmberg & Alvestrand   Expires February 21, 2013               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                Bundled media                  August 2012


   MUST, for each "m=" line that is part of the "BUNDLE" group:

   o  1.  Use the same port number value.
   o  2.  Use the same connection data ("c=" line) value.
   o  3.  Use the same SDP 'rtcp' attribute value, when used.
   o  4.  Use the same ICE candidate values, when used.
   o  5.  Insert an SDP 'rtpc-mux' attribute.

   NOTE: If an entity wants to disable specific media ("m=" line)
   associated with a "BUNDLE" group, it will use a zero port number
   value for the "m=" line associated with the media.

6.2.  SDP Offerer Procedures

   When an SDP Offerer creates an SDP Offer, that offers bundled media,
   it MUST create the SDP Offer according to the procedures in
   Section 6.1.

   If the associated SDP Answer contains an SDP session-level 'group'
   attribute, with a "BUNDLE" value, and the SDP Answer is created
   according to the proceudres in Section 6.1 (the same port number
   value is used for each "m=" line associated with the "BUNDLE" group,
   etc), the SDP Offerer can start using the same 5-tuple for sending
   and receiving media, associated with the group, between the entities.

   If the SDP Answer does not include a session-level SDP 'group'
   attribute, with a "BUNDLE" value, the SDP Offerer cannot use the same
   5-tuple for media associated with multiple "m=" lines.

   If the SDP Answererer indicates that it will not use bundled media,
   the SDP Offerer will still use the single port number value for each
   "m= line" associated with the offered "BUNDLE" group, and it will
   normally be able to separate each individual media.  The default
   mechanism for separating media received on a single IP address and
   port doing this is by using a 5-tuple based mapping for each
   individual media.  If the SDP Offerer is aware of the Synchronization
   Source (SSRC) [RFC3550] values that the SDP Answerer will use in the
   media it sends, and the SSRC values will be unique for each media,
   the SDP Offerer can separate media based on the SSRC values.

   NOTE: Assuming symmetric media is used, the SDP Offerer can use the
   port information from the SDP Answer in order to create the 5-tuple
   mapping for each media.

   If the SDP Offerer is not able to separate multiple media received on
   a single port, it MUST send a new SDP Offer, without offering bundled
   media, where a separate port number value is provide for each "m="
   line of the SDP Offer.

   If an SDP Offer, offering a "BUNDLE" group, and the SDP Offerer has
   reasons to believe that the rejection is due to the usage of a single
   port number value for multiple "m=" lines, the SDP Offerer SHOULD
   send a new SDP Offer, without a "BUNDLE" group, where a separate port
   number value is provide for each "m=" line of the SDP offer.

6.3.  SDP Answerer Procedures

   When an SDP Answerer receives an SDP Offer, which offers bundled
   media, and the SDP Answerer accepts the offered bundle group, the SDP
   Answerer MUST create an SDP Answer according to the procedures in
   Section 6.1.

   If the SDP Answerer does not accept the "BUNDLE" group in the SDP
   Offer, it MUST NOT include a session-evel 'group' attribute, with a
   "BUNDLE" value, in the associated SDP Answer.  In addition, the SDP
   Answerer MUST provide separate port number values for each "m=" line
   of the SDP Answer.

6.4.  Bundled SDP Information

6.4.1.  General

   This section describes how SDP information, given for each media
   description, is calculated into a single value for a "BUNDLE" group.

6.4.2.  Bandwidth (b=)

   The total proposed bandwidth is the sum of the proposed bandwidth for
   each "m=" line associated with a negotiated BUNDLE group.


7.  Single vs Multiple RTP Sessions

7.1.  General

   When entities negotiate the usage of bundled media, the default
   assumption is that all media associated with the bundled media will
   form a single RTP session.

   The usage of multiple RTP Sessions within a "BUNDLE" group is outside
   the scope of this specification.  Other specification needs to extend
   the mechanism in order to allow negotiation of such bundle groups.

7.2.  Single RTP Session

   When a single RTP Session is used, media associated with all "m="
   lines part of a bundle group share a single SSRC [RFC3550] numbering

   space.

   In addition, the following rules and restrictions apply for a single
   RTP Session:

   o  - The dynamic payload type values used in the "m=" lines MUST NOT
      overlap.
   o  - The "proto" value in each "m=" line MUST be identical (e.g.
      RTP/AVPF).
   o  - A given SSRC SHOULD NOT transmit RTP packets using payload types
      that originates from different "m=" lines.

   NOTE: The last bullet above is to avoid sending multiple media types
   from the same SSRC.  If transmission of multiple media types are done
   with time overlap RTP and RTCP fails to function.  Even if done in
   proper sequence this causes RTP Timestamp rate switching issues [ref
   to draft-ietf-avtext-multiple-clock-rates].


8.  Usage With ICE

8.1.  General

   This section describes how to use the "BUNDLE" grouping mechanism
   together with the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)
   mechanism [RFC5245].

8.2.  Candidates

   When an ICE-enabled SDP Offerer sends an SDP offer, it MUST include
   ICE candidates for each "m=" line associated with a "BUNDLE" group.
   The candidate values MUST be identical for each "m=" line associated
   with the group.  This rule applies also to subsequent SDP Offers,
   when the usage of bundled media has already been negotiated.

   When an ICE-enabled SDP Answerer receives an SDP Offer, offering a
   "BUNDLE" group and ICE, if the SDP Answerer enables ICE, MUST include
   ICE candidates for each "m=" line of the SDP Answer.  This also
   applies for "m=" lines that are part of a "BUNDLE" group, in which
   case the candidate values MUST be identical for each "m=" line
   associated with the group.  This rule applies also to subsequent SDP
   Answers, when the usage of bundled media has already been negotiated.

   Once the usage of bundled media has been negotiated, ICE connectivity
   checks and keep-alives only needs to be performed for the whole
   "BUNDLE" group, instead of for each individual m= line associated
   with the group.

10.  Example

   The example below shows an SDP Offer, where bundled media is offered.
   The example also shows two SDP Answer alternatives: one where bundled
   media is accepted, and one where bundled media is rejected (or, not
