Abstract 

   In the IPv6 address allocation scenarios, host self-generated 
   addresses are notionally conflicted with the network managed address 
   architecture. These addresses need to be registered in the networking 
   management plate for the purposes of central address administration. 
   This document introduces a generic address registration solution 
   using DHCPv6, and defines one new ND option and one new DHCPv6 option 
   in order to propagate the solicitations of registering self-generated 
   addresses. The registration procedure reuses the existing IA_NA in 
   the DHCPv6 protocol.

1. Introduction & Requirements 

   In the IPv6 address allocation scenarios, there are many host self-
   generated addresses, such as addresses in IPv6 Stateless Address 
   Configuration [RFC4862, RFC4941] scenario and Cryptographically 
   Generated Addresses (CGA, [RFC3972]), and etc. These addresses are 
   notionally conflicted with the network managed address architecture, 
   such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6, 
   [RFC3315]) managed network or network with Access Control List. 

   Many operators of enterprise networks and similarly tightly 
   administered networks have expressed the desire to be at least aware 
   the hosts' addresses when moving to IPv6. Furthermore, they may want 
   to stop the usage of some hosts' addresses for various reasons. 

   A useful way to give network administrators most of what they want, 
   while at the same time retaining compatibility with normal stateless 
   configuration would be: if the self-generated IPv6 addresses are  
   used, they may need to be registered in the networking management 
   plate. The host may be required to perform this registration since 
   only registered IPv6 addresses may access the network resources in 
   some scenarios. 

   In order to fulfill the abovementioned practice, this document 
   introduces a new Neighbor Discovery (ND) option and a new DHCPv6 
   option to propagate the address registration solicitation from 
   network management to hosts. DHCPv6 protocol is suitable to perform 
   the address registration procedure while the address registration 
   server may play by a DHCPv6 server or a stand-alone server. The 
   existing IA_NA in the DHCPv6 protocol is reused for the registration 
   procedure. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119]. 

3. Overview of Generic Address Registration Solution 

   By current default, the hosts with self-generated addresses do not 
   register their addresses to any network devices. However, this may 
   result that the network may reject the access request from these 
   devices if the address registration is requested.

   As showed in below Figure 1, in the generic address registration 
   solution, proposed by this document, the network management plate 
   firstly propagates the solicitations of registering self-generated 
   addresses, by messages from either local router (step 1a in Figure 1) 
   or DHCPv6 server (step 1b in Figure 1). 

   By received such solicitations, a host using the self-generated 
   address SHOULD send an address registration request message to the 
   address registration server (step 2 in Figure 1). The address 
   registration server may be acted by a DHCPv6 server. By received the 
   address registration request, the address registration server records 
   the requested address in the address database, which MAY be used by 
   other network functions, such as DNS or ACL, etc. The address 
   registration server should also assign lifetimes for the requested 
   address. An acknowledgement is sent back to the host with the 
   assigned lifetimes (step 3 in Figure 1).

              Figure 1: address registration procedure 

   By received the acknowledgement, the host can use the registered 
   address. It SHOULD use the assigned preferred and valid lifetime for 
   the corresponded address. 

4. Propagating the Address Registration Solicitation 

   In order to indicate or force the hosts with self-generated addresses 
   to register their addresses and the appointed address registration 
   server, new solicitation options need to be defined. 

   There are more than one mechanisms in which configuration parameters 
   could be pushed to the end hosts. The address registration

Internet-Draft draft-jiang-dhc-addr-registration-03.txt     August 2011 
    

   solicitation option can be carried in Router Advertisement (RA) 
   message, which is broadcasted by local routers. In the DHCPv6 managed 
   network, it can also be carried in DHCPv6 messages. 

   More precisely it defines one new ND option and one new DHCPv6 option 
   that convey a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN, as per Section 3.1 
   of [RFC1035]) of address registration(s). In order to make use of 
   these options, this document assumes appropriate name resolution 
   means (see Section 6.1.1 of [RFC1123]) are available on the host 
   client. The use of the FQDN may benefit for load-balancing purposes. 

   By receiving the address registration solicitation option(s), a host 
   SHOULD register its self-generated addresses, if there are any, to 
   the appointed registration server. The solicitation options may 
   include the IPv6 address(es) of address registration server. 

   In principle, hosts must receive a prefix from either RA message 
   [RFC4861] or DHCPv6 message [I-D.ietf-dhc-host-gen-id] so that they 
   can generate an IPv6 address by themselves. The Address Registration 
   Solicitation options could be propagated together with prefix 
   assignment information. 

4.1. ND Address Registration Solicitation Option 

   The ND Address Registration Solicitation Option allows routers to 
   propagate the solicitation for hosts to register their self-generated 
   address. This option also carries a domain name of the appointed 
   address registration server. This option SHOULD be propagated 
   together with ND Prefix Information Option, Section 4.6.2, [RFC4861]. 
   The format of the ND Address Registration Solicitation Option is 
   described as follows: 

        0                   1                   2                   3

       Fields: 

         Type      (TBA1) 

         Length     The length of the option in units of 8 octets,  
                  including the Type and Length fields. The value 0  
                  is invalid. The receiver MUST discard a message  
                  that contains this value. 

         Pad Length The number of padding octets beyond the end of the 
                  Domain Name field but within the length specified  
                  by the Length field. 

         Reserved   Padding bits. It is for future use also. The value  
                  MUST be initialized to zero by the sender, and MUST  
                  be ignored by the receiver. 

         Domain Name A fully qualified domain name of the appointed  
                  address registration server. The domain name is  
                  encoded as specified in Section 8 of [RFC3315]. Any  
                  possible future updates to Section 8 of the Section  
                  8 of [RFC3315] also apply to this option. 

         Padding:   A variable-length field making the option length a 
                  multiple of 8, containing as many octets as  
                  specified in the Pad Length field. Padding octets  
                  MUST be set to zero by senders and ignored by  
                  receivers. 

4.2. DHCPv6 Address Registration Solicitation Option 

   The DHCPv6 Address Registration Solicitation Option allows DHCPv6 
   server to propagate the solicitation for hosts to register their 
   self-generated address. This option also carries a domain name of the 
   appointed address registration server. This option SHOULD be 
   propagated together with DHCPv6 Prefix Information Option, Section 5, 
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-host-gen-id]. The format of the DHCPv6 Address 
   Registration Solicitation Option is described as follows:

                  possible future updates to Section 8 of the Section  
                  8 of [RFC3315] also apply to this option. 

5. DHCPv6 Address Registration Procedure 

   The current DHCPv6 protocol is reused as the address registration 
   protocol while a DHCPv6 serve plays as address registration server. 
   Identity Association for Non-temporary Addresses (IA_NA) [RFC3315] is 
   reused in order to fulfill the address registration interactions. 

5.1. DHCPv6 Address Registration Request 

   The host with self-generated address(es) sends a DHCPv6 Request 
   message to the appointed address registration server, which may be a 
   DHCPv6 server. 

   The DHCPv6 Request message SHOULD contain at least one IA_NA option. 
   The IA_NA option SHOULD contain at least one IA Address option. The 
   host SHOULD set the T1 and T2 fields in any IA_NA options, and the 
   preferred-lifetime and valid-lifetime fields in the IA Address 
   options to 0. 

   By received, the address registration server MUST register the 
   requested address in its address database, which MAY be used by other 
   network functions, such as DNS or ACL, etc. The address registration 
   server SHOULD also assign the lifetimes for these registered 
   addresses.

Internet-Draft draft-jiang-dhc-addr-registration-03.txt     August 2011 
    

   The address database contains both the self-generated addresses and 
   the DHCPv6 assigned addresses. They MAY be marked different in the 
   database. 

5.2. DHCPv6 Address Registration Acknowledge 

   The address registration server sends a Reply message as the response 
   to registration requests.  

   The DHCPv6 Reply message SHOULD contain at least one IA_NA option. 
   The IA_NA option SHOULD contain at least one IA Address option. The 
   server SHOULD set the T1 and T2 fields in any IA_NA options, and the 
   preferred-lifetime and valid-lifetime fields in the IA Address 
   options following the rules defined in Section 22 in [RFC3315]. 

   By received the acknowledgement from the server, the host can use the 
   registered address to access the network. It SHOULD use the values in 
   the preferred and valid lifetime fields for the preferred and valid 
   lifetimes of the address. 

   Note: the host MAY continue to use expired address, such as Locators 
   as Upper-Layer Identifiers (ULID) in Shim6 protocol [RFC5533], etc.; 
   but the network MAY refuse the network access from such addresses. 

6. Security Considerations 

   An attacker may use a faked address registration request option to 
   indicate hosts reports their address to a malicious server and 
   collect the user information. These attacks may be prevented by using 
   Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND, [RFC3971]) if RA Address 
   Registration Request Option is used, or AUTH option or Secure DHCP 
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-secure-dhcpv6] if DHCPv6 Address Registration Request 
   Option is used. 

7. IANA Considerations 

   This document defines a new Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] option, 
   which MUST be assigned Option Type values within the option numbering 
   space for Neighbor Discovery Option Type: 

       The Address Registration Solicitation Option (TBA1), described in 
       Section 4.1. 

   This document defines one new DHCPv6 [RFC3315] option, which MUST be 
   assigned Option Type values within the option numbering space for 
   DHCPv6 options:
