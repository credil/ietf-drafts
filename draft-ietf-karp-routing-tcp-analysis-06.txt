1.  Introduction

   In March 2006, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) described an
   attack on core routing infrastructure as an ideal attack that would
   inflict the greatest amount of damage, in their Report from the IAB
   workshop on Unwanted Traffic March 9-10, 2006 [RFC4948], and suggests
   steps to tighten the infrastructure against the attack.  Four main
   steps were identified for that tightening:

   1.  Create secure mechanisms and practices for operating routers.

   2.  Clean up the Internet Routing Registry (IRR) repository, and
       securing both the database and the access, so that it can be used
       for routing verifications.

   3.  Create specifications for cryptographic validation of routing
       message content.

   4.  Secure the routing protocols' packets on the wire.

   In order to secure the routing protocols this document performs an
   initial analysis of the current state of TCP based protocols
   including BGP, LDP, PCEP, and MSDP according to the requirements of
   KARP Design Guidelines [RFC6518].  Section 4.2 of the document uses
   the term "state" which will be referred to as the "state of the
   security method".  Thus a term like "Define Optimal State" would be
   referred to as "Define Optimal State of the Security Method".  This
   document builds on several previous analysis efforts into routing
   security.

   The OPSEC working group published Issues with existing Cryptographic
   Protection Methods for Routing Protocols [RFC6039], an analysis of
   cryptographic issues with routing protocols and Analysis of OSPF
   Security According to KARP Design Guide
   [draft-ietf-karp-ospf-analysis-03].

   Section 2 of this document looks at the current state of the security
   method for the four routing protocols, BGP, LDP, PCEP and MSDP.
   Section 3 examines what the optimal state of the security method
   would be for the four routing protocols, according to KARP Design
   Guidelines [RFC6518] and Section 4 does a analysis of the gap between
   the existing state of the security method and the optimal state of
   the security method for protocols and suggests some areas where
   improvement is needed.

2.  Current Assessment of BGP, LDP, PCEP and MSDP

   This section assesses the transport protocols for any authentication
   or integrity mechanisms used by the protocol.  It describes the
   current security mechanisms if any used by BGP, LDP, PCEP and MSDP.

2.1.  Transport layer

   At a transport layer, routing protocols are subject to a variety of
   DoS attacks, as outlined in Internet Denial-of-Service Considerations
   [RFC4732].  Such attacks can cause the routing protocol to become
   congested with the result that routing updates are supplied too
   slowly to be useful.  In extreme cases, these attacks prevent routers
   from converging after a change.

   Routing protocols use several methods to protect themselves.  Those
   that use TCP as a transport protocol use access lists to accept
   packets only from known sources.  These access lists also help
   protect edge routers from attacks originating outside the protected
   domain.  In addition, for edge routers running eBGP, TCP LISTEN is
   run only on interfaces on which its peers have been discovered or via
   which routing sessions are expected (as specified in router
   configuration databases).

   Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM) [RFC5082] describes a
   generalized Time to Live (TTL) security mechanism to protect a
   protocol stack from CPU-utilization based attacks.TCP Robustness
   [RFC5961] recommends some TCP level mitigations against spoofing
   attacks targeted towards long-lived routing protocol sessions.

   Even when BGP, LDP, PCEP and MSDP sessions use access lists, they are
   vulnerable to spoofing and man in the middle attacks.  Authentication
   and integrity checks allow the receiver of a routing protocol update
   to know that the message genuinely comes from the node that claims to
   have sent it, and to know whether the message has been modified.
   Sometimes routers can be subjected to a large number of
   authentication and integrity requests, exhausting connection
   resources on the router in a way that could lead to deny genuine
   requests.

   TCP MD5 [RFC2385] has been obsoleted by TCP-AO [RFC5925].  However,
   it is still widely used to authenticate TCP based routing protocols
   such as BGP.  It provides a way for carrying a MD5 digest in a TCP
   segment.  This digest acts like a signature for that segment,
   computed using information known only to the connection end points.
   The MD5 key used to compute the digest is stored locally on the
   router.  This option is used by routing protocols to provide for
   session level protection against the introduction of spoofed TCP



Jethanandani, et al.      Expires June 8, 2013                  [Page 5]

   segments into any existing TCP streams, in particular TCP Reset
   segments.  TCP MD5 does not provide a generic mechanism to support
   key roll-over.

   The Message Authentication Codes (MACs) used by TCP MD5 option, is
   considered too weak both because of the use of the hash function and
   because of the way the secret key used by TCP MD5 is managed.  TCP-AO
   [RFC5925], and its companion document Crypto Algorithms for TCP-AO
   [RFC5926], describe steps towards correcting both the MAC weakness
   and the management of secret keys.  For MAC it requires that two MAC
   algorithms be supported.  They are HMAC-SHA-1-96 as specified in HMAC
   [RFC2104], and AES-128-CMAC-96 as specified in NIST-SP800-38B
   [NIST-SP800-38B].  Cryptographic research suggests that both these
   MAC algorithms defined are fairly secure.  TCP-AO allows additional
   MACs to be added in the future.

2.2.  Keying mechanisms

   For TCP-AO [RFC5925] there is no Key Management Protocol (KMP) used
   to manage the keys that are employed to generate the Message
   Authentication Code (MAC).  TCP-AO talks about coordinating keys
   derived from Master Key Table (MKT) between endpoints and allows for
   a master key to be configured manually or for it to be managed via a
   out of band mechanism.

   It should be noted that most routers configured with static keys have
   not seen the key changed ever.  The common reason given for not
   changing the key is the difficulty in coordinating the change between
   pairs of routers when using TCP MD5.  It is well known that the
   longer the same key is used, the greater the chance that it can be
   guessed or exposed e.g. when an administrator with knowledge of the
   keys leaves the company.

   For point-to-point key management IKEv2 [RFC5996] protocol provides
   for automated key exchange under a SA, and can be used for a
   comprehensive Key Management Protocol (KMP) solution for routers.
   IKEv2 can be used for both IPsec SAs [RFC4301] and other types of
   SAs.  For example, Fibre Channel SAs [RFC4595] are currently
   negotiated with IKEv2.  Using IKEv2 to negotiate TCP-AO is a possible
   option.

2.3.  LDP

   Section 5 of LDP [RFC5036] states that LDP is subject to two
   different types of attacks: spoofing, and denial of service attacks.
   In addition, LDP distributes labels in the clear, enabling hackers to
   see what labels are being distributed.  The attacker can use that
   information to spoof a connection and distribute a different set of

Internet-Draft      BGP, LDP, PCEP and MSDP Analysis       December 2012


   labels causing traffic to be dropped.

2.3.1.  Spoofing attacks

   A spoofing attack against LDP can occur both during the discovery
   phase and during the session communication phase.

2.3.1.1.  Discovery exchanges using UDP

   Label Switching Routers (LSRs) indicate their willingness to
   establish and maintain LDP sessions by periodically sending Hello
   messages.  Reception of a Hello message serves to create a new "Hello
   adjacency", if one does not already exist, or to refresh an existing
   one.

   Unlike all other LDP messages, the Hello messages are sent using UDP.
   This means that they cannot benefit from the security mechanisms
   available with TCP.  LDP [RFC5036] does not provide any security
   mechanisms for use with Hello messages except for some configuration
   which may help protect against bogus discovery events.  These
   configurations include directly connected links and interfaces.
   Routers that do not use directly connected links have to use Extended
   Hello messages.

   Spoofing a Hello packet for an existing adjacency can cause the
   adjacency to time out and result in termination of the associated
   session.  This can occur when the spoofed Hello message specifies a
   small Hold Time, causing the receiver to expect Hello messages within
   this interval, while the true neighbor continues sending Hello
   messages at the lower, previously agreed to frequency.

   Spoofing a Hello packet can also cause the LDP session to be
   terminated.  This can occur when the spoofed Hello specifies a
   different Transport Address from the previously agreed one between
   neighbors.  Spoofed Hello messages are observed and reported as real
   problem in production networks.

2.3.1.2.  Session communication using TCP

   LDP like other TCP based routing protocols specifies use of the TCP
   MD5 Signature Option to provide for the authenticity and integrity of
   session messages.  As stated in section 2.1, MD5 authentication is
   considered too weak for this application.  A stronger hashing
   algorithm e.g SHA1, which is supported by TCP-AO [RFC5925] could be
   deployed to take care of the weakness.

   Alternatively, one could move to using TCP-AO which provides for
   stronger MAC algorithms, makes it easier to setup manual keys and

Internet-Draft      BGP, LDP, PCEP and MSDP Analysis       December 2012


   protects against replay attacks.

2.3.2.  Privacy Issues

   LDP provides no mechanism for protecting the privacy of label
   distribution.  Labels, like routing information are distributed in
   the clear.  There is currently no requirement for labels to be
   encrypted and that work is outside the scope of the KARP working
   group.

2.3.3.  Denial of Service Attacks

   LDP is subject to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks both in its
   discovery mode and in session mode.  These are documented in Section
   5.3 of LDP [RFC5036].

2.4.  PCEP

   Attacks on PCEP [RFC5440] may result in damage to active networks.
   These include computation responses, which if changed can cause
   protocols like LDP to setup sub-optimal or inappropriate LSPs.  In
   addition, PCE itself can be attacked by a variety of DoS attacks.
   Such attacks can cause path computations to be supplied too slowly to
   be of any value particularly as it relates to recovery or
   establishment of LSPs.

   As RFC 5440 states, PCEP could be the target of the following
   attacks.

   o  Spoofing (PCC or PCE implementation)

   o  Snooping (message interception)

   o  Falsification

   o  Denial of Service

   In inter-Autonomous Systems (AS) scenarios where PCE-to-PCE
   communication is required, attacks may be particularly significant
   with commercial as well as service-level agreement implications.

   Additionally, snooping of PCEP requests and responses may give an
   attacker information about the operation of the network.  By viewing
   the PCEP messages an attacker can determine the pattern of service
   establishment in the network, and can know where traffic is being
   routed, thereby making the network susceptible to targeted attacks
   and the data within specific LSPs vulnerable.

   Ensuring PCEP communication privacy is of key importance, especially
   in an inter-AS context, where PCEP communication end-points do not
   reside in the same AS.  An attacker that intercepts a PCE message
   could obtain sensitive information related to computed paths and
   resources.

2.5.  MSDP

   Similar to BGP and LDP, Multicast Source Distribution Protocol (MSDP)
   uses TCP MD5 [RFC2385] to protect TCP sessions via the TCP MD5
   option.  But with a weak MD5 authentication, TCP MD5 is not
   considered strong enough for this application.

   MSDP also advocates imposing a limit on number of source address and
   group addresses (S,G) that can be cached within the protocol and
   thereby mitigate state explosion due to any denial of service and
   other attacks.

3.  Optimal State for BGP, LDP, PCEP, and MSDP

   The ideal state of the security method for BGP, LDP, PCEP and MSDP
   protocols are when they can withstand any of the known types of
   attacks.

   Additionally, Key Management Protocol (KMP) for the routing sessions
   should help negotiate unique, pair wise random keys without
   administrator involvement.  It should also negotiate Security
   Association (SA) parameter required for the session connection,
   including key life times.  It should keep track of those lifetimes
   and negotiate new keys and parameters before they expire and do so
   without administrator involvement.  In the event of a breach,
   including when an administrator with knowledge of the keys leaves the
   company, the keys should be changed immediately.

   The DoS attacks for BGP, LDP, PCEP and MSDP are attacks to the
   transport protocol, TCP for the most part and UDP in case of
   discovery phase of LDP.  TCP and UDP should be able to withstand any
   of DoS scenarios by dropping packets that are attack packets in a way
   that does not impact legitimate packets.

   The routing protocols should provide a mechanism to authenticate the
   routing information carried within the payload.

3.1.  LDP

   To harden LDP against its current vulnerability to spoofing attacks,
   LDP needs to be upgraded such that an implementation is able to
   determine the authenticity of the neighbors sending the Hello
   message.

   Labels are similar to routing information which is distributed in the
   clear.  It is important to ensure that routers exchanging labels are
   mutually authenticated, and that there are no rogue peers or
   unauthenticated peers that can compromise the stability of the
   network.  However, there is currently no requirement that the labels
   be encrypted.

4.  Gap Analysis for BGP, LDP, PCEP and MSDP

   This section outlines the differences between the current state of
   the security methods for routing protocols, and the desired state of
   the security methods as outlined in section 4.2 of KARP Design
   Guidelines [RFC6518].  As that document states, these routing
   protocols fall into the category of one-to-one peering messages and
   will use peer keying protocol.  It covers issues that are common to
   the four protocols in this section, leaving protocol specific issues
   to sub-sections.

   At a transport level these routing protocols are subject to some of
   the same attacks that TCP applications are subject to.  These include
   DoS and spoofing attacks.  Internet Denial-of-Service Considerations
   [RFC4732] outlines some solutions.  Defending TCP Against Spoofing
   Attacks [RFC4953] recommends ways to prevent spoofing attacks.  In
   addition, the recommendations in [RFC5961] should also be followed
   and implemented to strengthen TCP.

   Routers lack comprehensive key management and keys derived from it
   that they can use to authenticate data.  As an example TCP-AO
   [RFC5925], talks about coordinating keys derived from Master Key
   Table (MKT) between endpoints, but the MKT itself has to be
   configured manually or through an out of band mechanism.  Also TCP-AO
   does not address the issue of connectionless reset, as it applies to
   routers that do not store MKT across reboots.

   Authentication, tamper protection, and encryption all require the use
   of keys by sender and receiver.  An automated KMP therefore has to
   include a way to distribute MKT between two end points with little or
   no administration overhead.  It has to cover automatic key rollover.
   It is expected that authentication will cover the packet, i.e. the
   payload and the TCP header and will not cover the frame i.e. the link
   layer 2 header.

   There are two methods of automatic key rollover.  Implicit key
   rollover can be initiated after certain volume of data gets exchanged
   or when a certain time has elapsed.  This does not require explicit
   signaling nor should it result in a reset of the TCP connection in a
   way that the links/adjacencies are affected.  On the other hand,
   explicit key rollover requires an out of band key signaling
   mechanism.  It can be triggered by either side and can be done
   anytime a security parameter changes e.g. an attack has happened, or
   a system administrator with access to the keys has left the company.
   An example of this is IKEv2 [RFC5996], but it could be any other new
   mechanisms also.

   As stated earlier TCP-AO [RFC5925], and its accompanying document



Jethanandani, et al.      Expires June 8, 2013                 [Page 11]

Internet-Draft      BGP, LDP, PCEP and MSDP Analysis       December 2012


   Crypto Algorithms for TCP-AO [RFC5926], requires that two MAC
   algorithms be supported, and they are HMAC-SHA-1-96 as specified in
   HMAC [RFC2104], and AES-128-CMAC-96 as specified in NIST-SP800-38B
   [NIST-SP800-38B].

   There is a need to protect authenticity and validity of the routing/
   label information that is carried in the payload of the sessions.
   However, that is outside the scope of this document and is being
   addressed by SIDR WG.  Similar mechanisms could be used for intra-
   domain protocols.

   Finally, replay protection is required.  The replay mechanism needs
   to be sufficient to prevent an attacker from creating a denial of
   service or disrupting the integrity of the routing protocol by
   replaying packets.  It is important that an attacker not be able to
   disrupt service by capturing packets and waiting for replay state to
   be lost.

4.1.  LDP

   As described in LDP [RFC5036], the threat of spoofed Basic Hellos can
   be reduced by only accepting Basic Hellos on interfaces that LSRs
   trust, employing GTSM [RFC5082] and ignoring Basic Hellos not
   addressed to the "all routers on this subnet" multicast group.
   Spoofing attacks via Targeted Hellos are potentially a more serious
   threat.  An LSR can reduce the threat of spoofed Extended Hellos by
   filtering them and accepting Hellos from sources permitted by an
   access lists.  However, performing the filtering using access lists
   requires LSR resource, and the LSR is still vulnerable to the IP
   source address spoofing.  Spoofing attacks can be solved by being
   able to authenticate the Hello messages, and an LSR can be configured
   to only accept Hello messages from specific peers when authentication
   is in use.

   LDP Hello Cryptographic Authentication
   [draft-zheng-mpls-ldp-hello-crypto-auth-04] suggest a new
   Cryptographic Authentication TLV that can be used as an
   authentication mechanism to secure Hello messages.

4.2.  PCEP

   Path Computation Element (PCE) discovery according to its RFC
   [RFC5440], is a significant feature for the successful deployment of
   PCEP in large networks.  This mechanism allows a Path Computation
   Client (PCC) to discover the existence of suitable PCEs within the
   network without the necessity of configuration.  It should be obvious
   that, where PCEs are discovered and not configured, the PCC cannot
   know the correct key to use.  There are different approaches to

   retain some aspect of security, but all of them require use of a keys
   and a keying mechanism, the need for which has been discussed above.

5.  Transition and Deployment Considerations

   As stated in KARP Design Guidelines [RFC6518], it is imperative that
   the new authentication and security mechanisms defined support
   incremental deployment, as it is not feasible to deploy the new
   routing protocol authentication mechanism overnight.

   Typically, authentication and security in a peer-to-peer protocol
   requires that both parties agree to the mechanisms that will be used.
   If an agreement is not reached the setup of the new mechanism will
   fail or will be deferred.  Upon failure, the routing protocols can
   fallback to the mechanisms that were already in place e.g. use static
   keys if that was the mechanism in place.  It is usually not possible
   for one end to use the new mechanism while the other end uses the
   old.  Policies can be put in place to retry upgrading after a said
   period of time, so a manual coordination is not required.

   If the automatic KMP requires use of public/private keys to exchange
   key material, the required CA root certificates may need to be
   installed to verify authenticity of requests initiated by a peer.
   Such a step does not require coordination with the peer except to
   decide what CA authority will be used.

6.  Security Considerations

   This section describes security considerations that BGP, LDP, PCEP
   and MSDP should try to meet.

   As with all routing protocols, they need protection from both on-path
   and off-path blind attacks.  A better way to protect them would be
   with per-packet protection using a cryptographic MAC.  In order to
   provide for the MAC, keys are needed.

   Once keys are used, mechanisms are required to support key rollover.
   This should cover both manual and automatic key rollover.  Multiple
   approaches could be used.  However, since the existing mechanisms
   provide a protocol field to identify the key as well as management
   mechanisms to introduce and retire new keys, focusing on the existing
   mechanism as a starting point is prudent.
