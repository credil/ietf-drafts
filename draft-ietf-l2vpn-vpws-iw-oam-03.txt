2. Introduction 

   This draft augments OAM message mapping [OAM-MSG] with OAM 
   procedures for scenarios when the attachment circuit does not 
   correspond to the pseudo wire. When combined with procedures defined 
   in [OAM-MSG], comprehensive OAM interworking can be defined for VPWS 
   services. VPWS services are defined in the L2 VPN framework [L2VPN-
   FRMK]. 
    
   The following VPWS types are covered in this document: 
    
   1. VPWS with heterogeneous ACs of ATM and FR types, and in which the 
      PW type is ATM or FR. In this case, FR-ATM service interworking 
      [FRF8.2] is performed in PE1 (or PE2) and a FR (or ATM) PW is 
      extended to the remote PE. This VPWS type will be referred to as 
      ''FR-ATM Interworking VPWS''. 
 
   2. VPWS with heterogeneous ACs of ATM, FR, and Ethernet types, and 
      in which the PW type is Ethernet. This VPWS type will be referred 
      to as ''Ethernet Interworking VPWS''. 
 
   3. VPWS with heterogeneous ACs of ATM, FR, and Ethernet types, and 
      in which the PW type is IP [ARP-Mediation]. This VPWS type will 
      be referred to as ''IP Interworking VPWS''. 
    
   OAM procedures for homogeneous VPWS circuits of ATM, FR, or Ethernet 
   types are described in [OAM-MSG].

3. Conventions 

   The words "defect" and "fault" are used interchangeably to mean any 
   condition that obstructs forwarding of user traffic between the CE 
   endpoints of the PW service. 

   The words "defect notification" and "defect indication" are used 
   interchangeably to mean any OAM message generated by a PE and sent 
   to other nodes in the network to convey the defect state local to 
   this PE. 

   An end-to-end virtual circuit in a VPWS consists of a 3 segment set: 
   <AC, PW, AC> [L2VPN-FRMK]. Note that the AC does not need to connect 
   a CE directly to a PE. An intermediate L2 network may exist. 

   A VPWS is homogeneous if AC and PW types are the same. E.g., ATM 
   VPWS: <ATM AC, ATM PW, ATM AC>. 

   A VPWS is heterogeneous if any two segments of the circuit are of 
   different types. E.g., IP interworking circuit: <ATM AC, IP PW, ATM 
   AC>, or <ATM AC, IP PW, ETH AC>. 

   The PW of a VPWS can be carried over three types of Packet Switched 
   Networks (PSNs). An "MPLS PSN" makes use of MPLS Label Switched 
   Paths [RFC3031] as the tunneling technology to forward the PW 
   packets. An "MPLS/IP PSN" makes use of MPLS-in-IP tunneling 
   [RFC4023], with an MPLS shim header used as PW demultiplexer. An 
   "L2TPv3/IP PSN" makes use of L2TPv3/IP [RFC3931] as the tunneling 
   technology with the L2TPv3/IP Session ID as the PW demultiplexer. 

   If LSP-Ping [RFC4379] is run over a PW as described in [RFC5085], it 
   will be referred to as "VCCV-Ping". If BFD is run over a PW as 
   described in [RFC5885], it will be referred to as "VCCV-BFD". 

   While PWs are inherently bidirectional entities, defects and OAM 
   messaging are related to a specific traffic direction. We use the 
   terms "upstream" and "downstream" to identify PEs in relation to the 
   traffic direction. A PE is upstream for the traffic it is forwarding 
   and is downstream for the traffic it is receiving. 

   We use the terms "local" and "remote" to identify native service 
   networks and ACs in relation to a specific PE. The local AC is 
   attached to the PE in question, while the remote AC is attached to 
   the PE at the other end of the PW. 

   A "transmit defect" is any defect that impacts traffic that is meant 
   to be sent or relayed by the observing PE. A "receive defect" is any

   defect that impacts traffic that is meant to be received by the 
   observing PE. Note that a receive defect also impacts traffic meant 
   to be relayed, and thus can be considered to incorporate two defect 
   states. Thus when a PE enters both receive and transmit defect 
   states of a PW service, the receive defect takes precedence over the 
   transmit defect in terms of the consequent actions. 

   A "forward defect indication" (FDI) is sent in the same direction as 
   the user traffic impacted by the defect. A "reverse defect 
   indication" (RDI) is sent in the direction opposite to that of the 
   impacted traffic. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

4. Reference Model and Defect Locations 

   Figure 1 illustrates the VPWS network reference model with an 
   indication of the possible defect locations. This model will be 
   referenced in the remainder of this document for describing the OAM 
   procedures.

   The procedures will be described in this document from the viewpoint 
   of PE1, so that N1 is the local native service network and N2 is the 
   remote native service network. It is assumed that the AC and PW are 
   of different types at PE1. PE2 will typically implement the same 
   procedures but it can use an AC and PW of the same or different 
   types. Note that PE1 is the upstream PE for traffic originating in 
   the local NS network N1, while it is the downstream PE for traffic 
   originating in the remote NS network N2.

   The following is a brief description of the defect locations: 

     a. Defect in NS network N1. This covers any defect in network N1 
        that impacts all or some ACs attached to PE1, and is thus a 
        local AC defect. The defect is conveyed to PE1 and to NS 
        network N2 using NS specific OAM defect indications. 

     b. Defect on a PE1 AC interface (another local AC defect).  

     c. Defect on a PE1 PSN interface. 

     d. Defect in the PSN network. This covers any defect in the PSN 
        that impacts all or some PWs between PE1 and PE2. The defect is 
        conveyed to the PE using a PSN and/or a PW specific OAM defect 
        indication. Note that both data plane defects and control plane 
        defects must be taken into consideration. Although control 
        messages may follow a different path than PW data plane 
        traffic, a control plane defect may affect the PW status. 

     e. Defect in NS network N2 (another remote AC defect). This covers 
        any defect in N2 which impacts all or a subset of ACs attached 
        to PE2. The defect is conveyed to PE2 and to NS network N1 
        using the NS OAM defect indication. 

     f. Defect on a PE2 AC interface (a remote AC defect). 

        
5. Abstract Defect States 

   sss PE1 must track four defect states that reflect the observed 
   states of both directions of the PW service on both the AC and the 
   PW sides. 

   Defects may impact one or both directions of the PW service. The 
   observed state is a combination of defects directly detected by PE1 
   and defects of which it has been made aware via notifications.

   PE1 will directly detect or be notified of AC receive or PW receive 
   defects as they occur upstream of PE1 and impact traffic being sent 
   to PE1. As a result, PE1 enters the AC or PW receive defect state. 

   In Figure 2, PE1 may be notified of a receive defect in the AC by 
   receiving a Forward Defect indication, e.g., ATM AIS, from CE1 or an 
   intervening network. This defect notification indicates that user 
   traffic sent by CE1 may not be received by PE1 due to a defect. PE1 
   can also directly detect an AC receive defect if it resulted from a 
   failure of the receive side in the local port or link over which the 
   AC is configured. 

   Similarly, PE1 may detect or be notified of a receive defect in the 
   PW by receiving a Forward Defect indication from PE2. If PW status 
   is used for fault notification, this message will indicate a Local 
   PSN-facing PW (egress) Transmit Fault or a Local AC (ingress) 
   Receive Fault at PE2. This defect notification indicates that user 
   traffic sent by CE2 may not be received by PE1 due to a defect. As a 
   result, PE1 enters the PW receive defect state. 

   Note that a Forward Defect Indication is sent in the same direction 
   as the user traffic impacted by the defect. 

   Generally, a PE cannot detect transmit defects directly and will 
   therefore need to be notified of AC transmit or PW transmit defects 
   by other devices. 

   In Figure 2, PE1 may be notified of a transmit defect in the AC by 
   receiving a Reverse Defect indication, e.g., ATM RDI, from CE1. This 
   defect relates to the traffic sent by PE1 to CE1 on the AC. 

   Similarly, PE1 may be notified of a transmit defect in the PW by 
   receiving a Reverse Defect indication from PE2. If PW status is used 
   for fault notification, this message will indicate a Local PSN 
   facing PW (ingress) Receive Fault or a Local Attachment Circuit 
   (egress) Transmit Fault at PE2. This defect impacts the traffic sent 
   by PE1 to CE2. As a result, PE1 enters the PW transmit defect state. 

   Note that a Reverse Defect indication is sent in the reverse 
   direction to the user traffic impacted by the defect. 

   The procedures outlined in this document define the entry and exit 
   criteria for each of the four states with respect to the set of PW 
   services within the document scope and the consequent actions that 
   PE1 must perform.

   When a PE enters both receive and transmit defect states related to 
   the same PW service, then the receive defect takes precedence over 
   transmit defect in terms of the consequent actions. 

6. VPWS OAM Modes 

   A heterogeneous VPWS forwards packets between an AC and a PW of 
   different types. It thus implements both NS OAM and PW OAM 
   mechanisms. 

   PW OAM defect notification messages and NS OAM messages are 
   described in [OAM-MSG]. Ethernet NS OAM messages are described in 
   [MPLS-ETH-OAM]. 

   Two different OAM modes are defined in [OAM-MSG], the distinction 
   being the method of mapping between the NS and PW OAM defect 
   notification messages. 

   The first mode, illustrated in Figure 3, is called the "single 
   emulated OAM loop" mode. Here a single end-to-end NS OAM loop is 
   emulated by transparently passing NS OAM messages over the PW. Note 
   that the PW OAM is shown outside the PW in Figure 3, as it is 
   transported in LDP messages or in the associated channel, not inside 
   the PW itself.

                  Figure 3: Single Emulated OAM Loop mode 

   The second OAM mode operates three OAM loops joined at the AC/PW 
   boundaries of the PEs. This is referred to as the "coupled OAM 
   loops" mode and is illustrated in Figure 4. Note that in contrast to 
   Figure 3, NS OAM messages are never carried over the PW.

   The coupled OAM loops mode implements the following behavior: 

     a. The upstream PE (PE1) MUST terminate and translate a received 
        NS defect notification message into a PW defect notification 
        message. 

     b. The upstream PE MUST signal local failures affecting its local 
        AC using PW defect notification messages to the downstream PE. 

     c. The upstream PE MUST signal local failures affecting the PW 
        using PW defect notification messages. 

     d. The downstream PE (PE2) MUST insert NS defect notification 
        messages into the AC when it detects or is notified of defects 
        in the PW or remote AC. This includes translating received PW 
        defect notification messages into NS defect notification 
        messages. 

   Table 1 summarizes the OAM mode used with each type of VPWS covered

   The consequent actions for an ATM AC are described in sections 9.3.1 
   and 9.3.2 of [OAM-MSG]. 

   The consequent actions for a FR AC are described in sections 10.3.1 
   and 10.3.2 of [OAM-MSG]. 

   The consequent actions for an Ethernet AC are described in sections 
   5.1 through 5.4 of [MPLS-ETH-OAM]. 

8. ATM AC Defect State Entry/Exit 

   The details of the ATM AC receive and transmit defect state 
   entry/exit criteria are described in sections 9.1 and 9.2 
   respectively of [OAM-MSG]. 

   The consequent actions are described in sections 9.3.4 and 9.3.5 of 
   [OAM-MSG]. 

   Note that all interworking VPWS covered in this document make use of 
   ATM VC as the AC. ATM VP cannot be used as a SAP in an interworking 
   VPWS. Therefore only ATM F5 OAM messages are relevant. 

9. FR AC Defect State Entry/Exit 

   The details of the FR AC receive and transmit defect state 
   entry/exit criteria are described in sections 10.1 and 10.2 
   respectively of [OAM-MSG].  

   The consequent actions are described in sections 10.3.4 and 10.3.5 
   of [OAM-MSG]. Note however that if the FR AC is part of a FR-ATM 
   interworking VPWS operating in the single emulated OAM loop mode, 
   then the consequent actions are described sections 9.3.4 and 9.3.5 
   of [OAM-MSG]. 

10. Ethernet AC Defect State Entry/Exit 

   The details of the Ethernet AC receive and transmit defect state 
   entry/exit criteria are described in sections 4.1 and 4.2 
   respectively of [MPLS-ETH-OAM]. 

   The consequent actions are described in sections 5.5 through 5.8 of 
   [MPLS-ETH-OAM]. 

11. Security Considerations 

   The mapping messages described in this document do not change the 
   security functions inherent in the actual messages. All generic

   security considerations applicable to PW traffic specified in 
   Section 10 of [RFC3985] are applicable to NS OAM messages 
   transferred inside the PW. 

   Security considerations in Section 10 of RFC 5085 for VCCV apply to 
   the OAM messages thus transferred. Security considerations 
   applicable to the PWE3 control protocol of RFC 4447 Section 8.2 
   apply to OAM indications transferred using the LDP status message. 

12. IANA Considerations 

   This document requires no IANA actions.
