Internet-Draft             PCEP Ext for GMPLS               October 2012


1.  Introduction

   Although [RFC4655] defines the PCE architecture and framework for
   both MPLS and GMPLS networks, current PCEP RFCs [RFC5440], [RFC5521],
   [RFC5541], [RFC5520] are focused on MPLS networks, and do not cover
   the wide range of GMPLS networks.  This document complements these
   RFCs by addressing the extensions required for GMPLS applications and
   routing requests, for example for OTN and WSON networks.

   The functional requirements to be considered by the PCEP extensions
   to support those application are described in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-aps-req] and
   [I-D.ietf-pce-wson-routing-wavelength].

1.2.  PCEP requirements for GMPLS

   The document [I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-aps-req] describes the set of PCEP
   requirements to support GMPLS TE-LSPs.  When a PCC requests a PCE to
   perform a path computation (by means of a PCReq message), the PCC
   should be able to indicate the following additional information:

   o  Which data flow is switched by the LSP: a combination of Switching
      Type (for instance L2SC or TDM), Switching Encoding (e.g.,
      Ethernet, SONET/SDH) and sometimes the Signal Type (e.g. in case
      of TDM/LSC switching capability)

   o  Data flow specific traffic parameters, which are technology
      specific.  For instance, in SDH/SONET and G.709 OTN networks the
      Concatenation Type and the Concatenation Number have an influence
      on the switched data and on which link it can be supported

   o  Support for asymmetric bandwidth requests.

   o  Support for unnumbered interface identifiers, as defined in
      [RFC3477]

   o  Label information and technology specific label(s) such as
      wavelength labels as defined in [RFC6205].  A PCC should also be
      able to specify a Label restriction similar to the one supported
      by RSVP.

   o  Ability to indicate the requested granularity for the path ERO:
      node, link or label.  This is to allow the use of the explicit
      label control feature of RSVP-TE.

   We describe in this document a set of PCEP protocol extensions,
   including new objects, TLVs, encodings, error codes and procedures,
   in order to fulfill the aforementioned requirements.

1.3.  Current GMPLS support and limitation of existing PCEP objects

   PCEP as of [RFC5440], [RFC5521] and [I-D.ietf-pce-inter-layer-ext],
   supports the following objects, included in requests and responses
   related to the described requirements.

   From [RFC5440]:

   o  ENDPOINTS: only numbered endpoints are considered.  The context
      specifies whether they are node identifiers or numbered
      interfaces.

   o  BANDWIDTH: the data rate is encoded in the bandwidth object (as
      IEEE 32 bit float).  [RFC5440] does not include the ability to
      convey a (Intserv) TSPEC object.

   o  ERO : Unnumbered endpoints are supported.

   o  LSPA: LSP attributes (setup and holding priorities)

   From [RFC5521] :

   o  XRO object :

      *  This object allows excluding (strict or not) resources, and
         includes the requested diversity (node, link or SRLG).

      *  When the F bit is set, the request indicates that the existing
         route has failed and the resources present in the RRO can be
         reused.

   From [I-D.ietf-pce-inter-layer-ext]:

   o  INTER-LAYER : indicates whether inter-layer computation is allowed

   o  SWITCH-LAYER : indicates which layer(s) should be considered, can
      be used to represent the RSVP-TE generalized label request

   o  REQ-ADAP-CAP : indicates the adaptation capabilities requested,
      can also be used for the endpoints in case of mono-layer

      computation

   The shortcomings of the existing PCEP object are:

      The BANDWIDTH and LOAD-BALANCING objects do not describe the
      details of the traffic request (for example NVC, multiplier) in
      the context of GMPLS networks, for instance TDM or OTN networks.

      The END-POINTS object does not allow specifying an unnumbered
      interface, nor potential label restrictions on the interface.
      Those parameters are of interest in case of switching constraints.

      The IRO/XRO objects do not allow the inclusion/exclusion of labels

   Current attributes do not allow expressing the requested link
   protection level and/or the end-to-end protection attributes.

   The covered PCEP extensions are:

      New objects are introduced (GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH and GENERALIZED-
      LOAD-BALANCING) for flexible bandwidth encoding,

      A new object type is introduced for the END-POINTS object
      (GENERALIZED-ENDPOINT),

      A new TLV is added to the LSPA object.

      A new TLV type for label is allowed in IRO and XRO objects.

      In order to indicate the used routing granularity in the response,
      a new flag in the RP object is added.

1.4.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  PCEP objects and extensions

   This section describes the required PCEP objects and extensions.  The
   PCReq and PCRep messages are defined in [RFC5440].  The format of the
   PCEP request and response with the proposed extensions (GENERALIZED-
   BANDWIDTH, GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING, SUGGESTED-LABEL-SET and LABEL-
   SET) is as follows:

     <request>::= <RP>
                  <segment-computation>|<path-key-expansion>

     <segment-computation> ::=
       <END-POINTS>
       [<LSPA>]
       [<BANDWIDTH>][<GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH>...]
       [<metric-list>]
       [<OF>]
       [<RRO> [<BANDWIDTH>][<GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH>...]]
       [<IRO>]
       [<LOAD-BALANCING>]
       [<GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING>...]
       [<XRO>]

     <path-key-expansion> ::= <PATH-KEY>

     <response>::=<RP>
       [<NO-PATH>]
       [<attribute-list>]
       [<path-list>]

     <path-list>::=<path>[<path-list>]
     <path>::= <ERO><attribute-list>
     <metric-list>::=<METRIC>[<metric-list>]


   Where:

      <attribute-list>::=[<LSPA>]
      [<BANDWIDTH>]
      [<GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH>...]
      [<GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING>...]
      [<metric-list>]
      [<IRO>]

   For point-to-multipoint(P2MP) computations, the grammar is:

    <segment-computation> ::=
        <end-point-rro-pair-list>
        [<OF>]
        [<LSPA>]
        [<BANDWIDTH>]
        [<GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH>...]
        [<metric-list>]
        [<IRO>]
        [<LOAD-BALANCING>]
        [<GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING>...]
        [<XRO>]

     <end-point-rro-pair-list>::=
              <END-POINTS>[<RRO-List>][<BANDWIDTH>]
             [<GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH>...]
             [<end-point-rro-pair-list>]

     <RRO-List>::=<RRO>[<BANDWIDTH>]
     [<GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH>...][<RRO-List>]

2.1.  RP object extension

   Explicit label control (ELC) is a procedure supported by RSVP-TE,
   where the outgoing label(s) is(are) encoded in the ERO.  In
   consequence, the PCE may be able to provide such label(s) directly in
   the path ERO.  The PCC, depending on policies or switching layer, may
   be required to use explicit label control or expect explicit link,
   thus it need to indicate in the PCReq which granularity it is
   expecting in the ERO.  This correspond to requirement 12 of
   [I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-aps-req] The possible granularities can be node,
   link or label.  The granularities are inter-dependent, in the sense
   that link granularity implies the presence of node information in the
   ERO; similarly, a label granularity implies that the ERO contains
   node, link and label information.

   A new 2-bit routing granularity (RG) flag is defined in the RP
   object.  The values are defined as follows














Margaria, et al.         Expires April 24, 2013                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft             PCEP Ext for GMPLS               October 2012



                               0 : node

                               1 : link

                               2 : label

                               3 : reserved

   The flag in the RP object indicates the requested route granularity.
   The PCE MAY try to follow this granularity and MAY return a NO-PATH
   if the requested granularity cannot be provided.  The PCE MAY return
   finer granularity on the route based on its policy.  The PCC can
   decide if the ERO is acceptable based on its content.

   If a PCE honored the the requested routing granularity for a request,
   it SHOULD indicate the selected routing granularity in the RP object
   included in the response .  The RG flag is backward-compatible with
   [RFC5440]: the value sent by an implementation (PCC or PCE) not
   supporting it will indicate a node granularity.

2.2.  Traffic parameters encoding, GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH

   The PCEP BANDWIDTH object does not describe the details of the signal
   (for example NVC, multiplier), hence the bandwidth information should
   be extended to use the RSVP Tspec object encoding.  The PCEP
   BANDWIDTH object defines two types: 1 and 2.  C-Type 2 is
   representing the existing bandwidth in case of re-optimization.

   The following possibilities cannot be represented in the BANDWIDTH
   object:

   o  Asymmetric bandwidth (different bandwidth in forward and reverse
      direction), as described in [RFC6387]

   o  GMPLS (SDH/SONET, G.709, ATM, MEF etc) parameters are not
      supported.

   This correspond to requirement 3,4,5 and 11 of
   [I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-aps-req].

   According to [RFC5440] the BANDWIDTH object has no TLV and has a
   fixed size of 4 bytes.  This definition does not allow extending it
   with the required information.  To express this information, a new
   object named GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH with Object Type 1, having the
   following format is defined.  The definitions below apply for Object
   Type 1.  The payload of the GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH is as follows:

   The GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH has a variable length.  The Traffic spec
   length field indicates the length of the Traffic spec field.  The
   bits R and O have the following meaning:

      O bit : when set the value refers to the previous bandwidth in
      case of re-optimization

      R bit : when set the value refers to the bandwidth of the reverse
      direction

   The TSpec Type field determines which type of bandwidth is
   represented by the object.

   The TSpec Type types correspond to the RSVPT-TE SENDER_TSPEC (Object
   Class 12) C-Types

   The encoding of the field Traffic Spec is the same as in RSVP-TE, it
   can be found in the following references.

                      Object Type Name      Reference

   The GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH MAY appear more than once in a request
   message.  If more than one GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH objects have the
   same Tspec type, Reserved, R and O values, only the first one is

   processed, the other objects are ignored.

   A PCE MAY ignore GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH objects, a PCC that requires a
   GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH to be used can set the P (Processing) bit in
   the object header.

   When a PCC needs to request a bi-directional path with asymmetric
   bandwidth, it SHOULD specify the different bandwidth in the forward
   and reverse directions through two separate GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH
   objects.  If the PCC set the P bit on both objects the PCE MUST
   compute a path that satisfies the asymmetric bandwidth constraint .
   If the P bit on the reverse or the forward GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH
   object is not set the PCE MAY ignore this constraint.

   A PCE MAY include the GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH objects in the response
   to indicate the GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH of the path

   Optional TLVs may be included within the object body to specify more
   specific bandwidth requirements.  No TLVs for the GENERALIZED-
   BANDWIDTH are defined by this document.

2.3.  Traffic parameters encoding, GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING

   The LOAD-BALANCING object [RFC5440] is used to request a set of
   maximum Max-LSP TE-LSP having in total the bandwidth specified in
   BANDWIDTH, each TE-LSP having a minimum of bandwidth.  The LOAD-
   BALANCING follows the bandwidth encoding of the BANDWIDTH object, and
   thus it does not describe enough details for the traffic
   specification expected by GMPLS.  A PCC should be allowed to request
   a set of TE-LSP also in case of GMPLS traffic specification.

   According to [RFC5440] the LOAD-BALANCING object has no optional TLVs
   and has a fixed size of 8 bytes.  This definition does not allow
   extending it with the required information.  To express this
   information, a new Object named GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING is
   defined.

   The GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING object, as the LOAD-BALANCING object,
   allows the PCC to request a set of TE-LSP having in total the
   GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH traffic specification with potentially Max-Lsp,
   each TE-LSP having a minimum of Min Traffic spec.  The GENERALIZED-
   LOAD-BALANCING is optional.

   GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING Object-Class is to be assigned by IANA.
   GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING Object Type 1 is defined below.  The TSpec
   Type field determines which type of minimum bandwidth is represented
   by the object.

   Traffic spec length (16 bits): the total length of the min traffic
   specification.  It should be noted that the RSVP traffic
   specification may also include TLV different than the PCEP TLVs.

   TSpec Type (8 bits) : the traffic specification type, it correspond
   to the RSVPT-TE SENDER_TSPEC (Object Class 12) C-Types

   Flags (8 bits): The undefined Flags field MUST be set to zero on
   transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.  The following flag is
   defined:

      R Flag : (1 bit) set when the value refer to the bandwidth of the
      reverse direction

   Max-LSP (8 bits): maximum number of TE LSPs in the set.

   Min-Traffic spec (variable): Specifies the minimum traffic spec of
   each element of the set of TE LSPs.

   The encoding of the field Min Traffic Spec is the same as in RSVP-TE,
   it can be found in the following references.

   The GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING MAY appear more than once in a PCEP
   request.  If more than one GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING have the same
   TSpec Type, and R Flag, only the first one is processed, the others
   are ignored.

   A PCE MAY ignore GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING objects.  A PCC that
   requires a GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING to be used can set the P
   (Processing) bit in the object header.

   When a PCC needs to request a bi-directional path with asymmetric
   bandwidth while specifying load balancing constraints, it SHOULD
   specify the different bandwidth in forward and reverse directions
   through two separate GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING objects with
   different R Flag.  If the PCC set the P bit on both object the PCE
   MUST compute a path that satisfies the asymmetric bandwidth
   constraint .  If the P bit is not set the reverse or forward
   GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING object the PCE MAY ignore this constraint.

   Optional TLVs may be included within the object body to specify more
   specific bandwidth requirements.  No TLVs for the GENERALIZED-LOAD-
   BALANCING are defined by this document.

   The GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING object has the same semantic as the
   LOAD-BALANCING object; If a PCC requests the computation of a set of
   TE LSPs so that the total of their generalized bandwidth is X, the
   maximum number of TE LSPs is N, and each TE LSP must at least have a
   bandwidth of B, it inserts a GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH object specifying
   X as the required bandwidth and a GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING object
   with the Max-LSP and Min-traffic spec fields set to N and B,
   respectively.

   For example a request for one co-signaled n x VC-4 TE-LSP will not
   use the GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING.  In case the V4 components can
   use different paths, the GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH will contain a traffic
   specification indicating the complete n x VC4 traffic specification
   and the GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING the minimum co-signaled VC4.  For

   a SDH network, a request to have a TE-LSP group with 10 VC4
   container, each path using at minimum 2VC4 container, can be
   represented with a GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH object with OT=4, the
   content of the Traffic specification is ST=6,RCC=0,NCC=0,NVC=10,MT=1.
   The GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING, OT=4,R=0,Max-LSP=5, min Traffic spec
   is (ST=6,RCC=0,NCC=0,NVC=2,MT=1).  The PCE can respond with a
   response with maximum 5 path, each of them having a GENERALIZED-
   BANDWIDTH OT=4,R=0, and traffic spec matching the minimum traffic
   spec from the GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING object of the corresponding
   request.

2.4.  END-POINTS Object extensions

   The END-POINTS object is used in a PCEP request message to specify
   the source and the destination of the path for which a path
   computation is requested.  From [RFC5440]the source IP address and
   the destination IP address are used to identify those.  A new Object
   Type is defined to address the following possibilities:

   o  Different source and destination endpoint types.

   o  Label restrictions on the endpoint.

   o  Specification of unnumbered endpoints type as seen in GMPLS
      networks.

   The Object encoding is described in the following sections.

   In path computation within a GMPLS context the endpoints can:

   o  Be unnumbered as described in [RFC3477].

   o  Have label(s) associated to them, specifying a set of constraints
      in the allocation of labels.

   o  May have different switching capabilities

   The IPv4 and IPv6 endpoints are used to represent the source and
   destination IP addresses.  The scope of the IP address (Node or
   numbered Link) is not explicitly stated.  It is also possible to
   request a Path between a numbered link and an unnumbered link, or a
   P2MP path between different type of endpoints.

   This new C-Type also supports the specification of constraints on the
   endpoint label to be use.  The PCE might know the interface
   restrictions but this is not a requirement.  This corresponds to
   requirements 6 and 10 of [I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-aps-req].

2.4.1.  Generalized Endpoint Object Type

   The Generalized Endpoint object type format consists of a body and a
   list of TLVs scoped to this object type object.  The TLVs give the
   details of the endpoints and are described in Section 2.4.2.  For
   each endpoint type, a different grammar is defined.  The TLVs defined
   to describe an endpoint are:

   1.  IPv4 address endpoint.

   2.  IPv6 address endpoint.

   3.  Unnumbered endpoint.

   4.  Label set restriction.

   5.  Suggested label set restriction.

   The Label Set and Suggested label set TLVs are used to restrict the
   label allocation in the PCE.  Those TLVs express the set of
   restrictions provided by signaling.  Label restriction support can be
   an explicit value (Label set describing one label), mandatory range
   restrictions (Label set), optional range restriction (suggested label
   set) and single suggested value is using the suggested label set.
   Endpoints label restriction may not be part of the RRO or IRO, they
   may be included when following [RFC4003] in signaling for egress
   endpoint, but ingress endpoint properties may be local to the PCC and
   not signaled.  To support this case the label set allows to indicate
   which label are used in case of reoptimization.  The label range
   restrictions are valid in GMPLS networks, either by PCC policy or
   depending on the switching technology used, for instance on given
   Ethernet or ODU equipment having limited hardware capabilities
   restricting the label range.  Label set restriction also applies to
   WSON networks where the optical sender and receivers are limited in
   their frequency tunability ranges, restricting then in GMPLS the
   possible label ranges on the interface.  The END-POINTS Object with
   Generalized Endpoint object type is encoded as follow:

       0                   1                   2                   3

   5-244   Reserved

   The endpoint type is used to cover both point-to-point and different
   point-to-multipoint endpoints.  Endpoint type 0 MAY be accepted by
   the PCE, other endpoint type MAY be supported if the PCE
   implementation supports P2MP path calculation.  A PCE not supporting
   a given endpoint type MUST respond with a PCErr with error code "Path
   computation failure", error type "Unsupported endpoint type in END-
   POINTS Generalized Endpoint object type".  The TLVs present in the
   request object body MUST follow the following grammar:

   ENDPOINT object in the response with only the TLV it did not

   TLVs but not being able to fulfill the label restriction MUST respond
   with a response with NO-PATH with the bit "No endpoint label
   resource" or "No endpoint label resource in range" in the NO-PATH-
   VECTOR TLV, the response SHOULD include the ENDPOINT object in the
   response with only the TLV where it could not met the constraint.

2.4.2.  END-POINTS TLVs extensions

   All endpoint TLVs have the standard PCEP TLV header as defined in

   semantic as in [RFC3477] The TLV value is encoded as follow (TLV-
   Type=TBA)

   This TLV MAY be ignored, in which case a PCRep with NO-PATH should be
   responded, as described in Section 2.4.1.

2.4.2.4.  LABEL-REQUEST TLV

   The LABEL-REQUEST TLV indicates the switching capability and encoding
   type of the following label restriction list for the endpoint.  Its
   format is the same as described in [RFC3471] Section 3.1 Generalized
   label request.  The LABEL-REQUEST TLV use TLV-Type=TBA.  The fields
   are encoded as in the RSVP-TE.  The Encoding Type indicates the
   encoding type, e.g., SONET/SDH/GigE etc., that will be used with the
   data associated.  The Switching type indicates the type of switching
   that is being requested on the endpoint.  G-PID identifies the
   payload.  This TLV and the following one are introduced to satisfy
   requirement 13 for the endpoint.  It is not directly related to the
   TE-LSP label request, which is expressed by the SWITCH-LAYER object.

   On the path calculation request only the Tspec and switch layer need
   to be coherent, the endpoint labels could be different (supporting a
   different Tspec).  Hence the label restrictions include a Generalized
   label request in order to interpret the labels.  This TLV MAY be
   ignored, in which case a PCRep with NO-PATH should be responded, as
   described in Section 2.4.1.

2.4.2.5.  Labels TLV

   Label or label range restrictions may be specified for the TE-LSP
   endpoints.  Those are encoded using the LABEL-SET TLV.  The label
   value need to be interpreted with a description on the Encoding and
   switching type.  The REQ-ADAP-CAP object from
   [I-D.ietf-pce-inter-layer-ext] can be used in case of mono-layer
   request, however in case of multilayer it is possible to have in the
   future more than one object, so it is better to have a dedicated TLV
   for the label and label request (the scope is then more clear).

      follows [RFC3471] Section 3.5 "Label set" with the addition of a U

   o  SUGGESTED-LABEL-SET TLV Set, Type=TBA.  The TLV length is variable
      and its encoding is as LABEL-SET TLV.  The 0 bit SHOULD be set to
      0.

   A LABEL-SET TLV represents a set of possible labels that can be used
   on an interface.  The label allocated on the first link SHOULD be
   within the label set range.  The action parameter in the Label set
   indicates the type of list provided.  Those parameters are described
   by [RFC3471] section 3.5.1 A SUGGESTED-LABEL-SET TLV has the same
   encoding as the LABEL-SET TLV, it indicates to the PCE a set of
   preferred (ordered) set of labels to be used.  The PCE MAY use those
   labels for label allocation.

   The U and 0 bits have the following meaning:

Internet-Draft             PCEP Ext for GMPLS               October 2012



   U: Upstream direction: set when the label or label set is in the
      reverse direction

   O: Old Label: set when the TLV represent the old label in case in
      case of re-optimization.  This Bit SHOULD be set to 0 in a
      SUGGESTED-LABEL-SET TLV Set. This Label MAY be reused.  The R bit
      of the RP object MUST be set.  When this bit is set the Action
      field MUST be set to 0 (Inclusive List) and the Label Set MUST
      contain one subchannel.

   Several LABEL_SET TLVs MAY be present with the 0 bit cleared.  At
   most 2 LABEL_SET TLV SHOULD be present with the 0 bit set, at most
   one with the U bit set and at most one with the U bit cleared.  For a
   given U bit value if more than one LABEL_SET TLV with the O bit set
   is present, the first TLV SHOULD be processed and the following TLV
   with the same U and O bit SHOULD be ignored.

   A SUGGESTED-LABEL-SET TLV with the O bit set MUST trigger a PCErr
   message with error type="Reception of an invalid object" error
   value="Wrong LABEL-SET or SUGGESTED-LABEL-SET TLV present with 0 bit
   set".

   A LABEL-SET TLV with the O bit set and an Action Field not set to 0
   (Inclusive list) or containing more than one subchannel MUST trigger
   a PCErr message with error type="Reception of an invalid object"
   error value="Wrong LABEL-SET or SUGGESTED-LABEL-SET TLV present with
   0 bit set".

   If a LABEL-SET TLV is present with O bit set, the R bit of the RP
   object MUST be set or a PCErr message with error type="Reception of
   an invalid object" error value="LABEL-SET TLV present with 0 bit set
   but without R bit set in RP".

2.5.  IRO extension

   The IRO as defined in [RFC5440] is used to include specific objects
   in the path.  RSVP allows to include label definition, in order to
   fulfill requirement 13 the IRO should support the new subobject type
   as defined in [RFC3473]:


                              Type Sub-object

                              3    LABEL

   The L bit of such sub-object has no meaning within an IRO.

Internet-Draft             PCEP Ext for GMPLS               October 2012


   The Label subobject MUST follow a subobject identifying a link ,
   currently an IP address subobject (Type 1 or 2) or an interface id
   (type 4) subobject.  The procedure associated with this subobject is
   as follow

   If the PCE allocates labels (e.g via explicit label control) the PCE
   MUST allocate one label of from within the set of label values for
   the given link.  If the PCE does not assign labels a response with a
   NO-PATH and a NO-PATH-VECTOR-TLV with the bit .'No label resource in
   range' set.

2.6.  XRO extension

   The XRO as defined in [RFC5521] is used to exclude specific objects
   in the path.  RSVP allows to exclude labels ([RFC6001], in order to
   fulfill requirement 13 of [I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-aps-req] section 4.1,
   the XRO should support a new subobject to support label exclusion.

   The encoding of the XRO Label subobject follows the encoding of the
   Label ERO subobject defined in [RFC3473] and XRO subobject defined in
   [RFC5521].  The XRO Label subobject is defined as follows:

   XRO Subobject Type 3: Label Subobject.

   0                   1                   2                   3

         See [RFC5521],The total length of the subobject in bytes
         (including the Type and Length fields).  The Length is always
         divisible by 4.

         Object (see [RFC3471]).

      Label



         See [RFC3471].

   XRO Label subobjects MUST follow the numbered or unnumbered interface
   subobjects to which they refer.  Several XRO Labels subobject MAY be
   present.

   The L bit of such sub-object has no meaning within an XRO.

2.7.  LSPA extensions

   The LSPA carries the LSP attributes.  In the end-to-end protection
   context this also includes the protection state information.  This
   object is introduced to fulfill requirement 7 of
   [I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-aps-req] section 4.1 and requirement 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-aps-req] section 4.2 and may be used as a policy
   input for route and label selection on request.  The LSPA object MAY
   carry a PROTECTION-ATTRIBUTE TLV defined as : Type TBA: PROTECTION-
   ATTRIBUTE

   The content is as defined in [RFC4872], [RFC4873].

   LSP Flags can be considered for routing policy based on the
   protection type.  The other attributes are only meaningful for a
   stateful PCE.

   This TLV is optional and MAY be ignored by the PCE, in which case it
   MUST NOT include the TLV in the LSPA, if present, of the response.
   When the TLV is used by the PCE, a LSPA object and the PROTECTION-
   ATTRIBUTE TLV MUST be included in the response.  Fields that were not
   considered MUST be set to 0.

2.8.  NO-PATH Object Extension

   The NO-PATH object is used in PCRep messages in response to an
   unsuccessful path computation request (the PCE could not find a path
   satisfying the set of constraints).  In this scenario, PCE MUST
   include a NO-PATH object in the PCRep message.  The NO-PATH object
   may carries the NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV that specifies more information on
   the reasons that led to a negative reply.  In case of GMPLS networks
   there could be some more additional constraints that led to the
   failure like protection mismatch, lack of resources, and so on.  Few
   new flags have been introduced in the 32-bit flag field of the NO-
   PATH-VECTOR TLV and no modifications have been made in the NO-PATH
   object.

2.8.1.  Extensions to NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV

   The modified NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV carrying the additional information
   is as follows:

      Bit number TBA - Protection Mismatch (1-bit).  Specifies the
      mismatch of the protection type in the PROTECTION-ATTRIBUTE TLV in
      the request.

      Bit number TBA - No Resource (1-bit).  Specifies that the
      resources are not currently sufficient to provide the path.

      Bit number TBA - Granularity not supported (1-bit).  Specifies
      that the PCE is not able to provide a route with the requested
      granularity.

      Bit number TBA - No endpoint label resource (1-bit).  Specifies
      that the PCE is not able to provide a route because of the
      endpoint label restriction.

      Bit number TBA - No endpoint label resource in range (1-bit).
      Specifies that the PCE is not able to provide a route because of
      the endpoint label set restriction.

      Bit number TBA - No label resource in range (1-bit).  Specifies
      that the PCE is not able to provide a route because of the label
      set restriction.

3.  Additional Error Type and Error Values Defined

   A PCEP-ERROR object is used to report a PCEP error and is
   characterized by an Error-Type that specifies the type of error while
   Error-value that provides additional information about the error
   type.  An additional error type and few error values are defined to
   represent some of the errors related to the newly identified objects
   related to SDH networks.  For each PCEP error, an Error-Type and an
   Error-value are defined.  Error-Type 1 to 10 are already defined in
   [RFC5440].  Additional Error- values are defined for Error-Type 10
   and A new Error-Type is introduced (value TBA).

   Error-Type Error-value

       10     Reception of an
              invalid object

4.  Manageability Considerations

   This section follows the guidance of [RFC6123].

4.1.  Control of Function through Configuration and Policy

   This document makes no change to the basic operation of PCEP and so
   the requirements described in [RFC5440] Section 8.1. also apply to
   this document.  In addition to those requirements a PCEP
   implementation MAY allow the configuration of the following
   parameters:

      Accepted RG in the RP object.

      Default RG to use (overriding the one present in the PCReq)

      Accepted GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH parameters in request, default
      mapping to use when not specified in the request

      Accepted GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING parameters in request.

      Accepted endpoint type in END-POINTS object type Generalized
      Endpoint and allowed TLVs

      Accepted range for label restrictions in label restriction in END-
      POINTS, or IRO or XRO objects

      PROTECTION-ATTRIBUTE TLV acceptance and suppression.

   Those parameters configuration are applicable to the different
   sessions as described in [RFC5440] Section 8.1 (by default, per PCEP
   peer, ..etc).

4.2.  Information and Data Models

   This document makes no change to the basic operation of PCEP and so
   the requirements described in [RFC5440] Section 8.2. also apply to
   this document.  This document does not introduces new ERO sub object,
   ERO information model is already covered in [RFC4802].

4.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   This document makes no change to the basic operation of PCEP and so
   there are no changes to the requirements for liveness detection and
   monitoring set out in [RFC4657] and [RFC5440] Section 8.3.

Internet-Draft             PCEP Ext for GMPLS               October 2012


4.4.  Verifying Correct Operation

   This document makes no change to the basic operations of PCEP and
   considerations described in [RFC5440] Section 8.4.  New errors
   introduced by this document should be covered by the requirement to
   log error events.

4.5.  Requirements on Other Protocols and Functional Components

   No new Requirements on Other Protocols and Functional Components are
   made by this document.  This document does not require ERO object
   extensions.  Any new ERO subobject defined in CCAMP working group can
   be adopted without modifying the operations defined in this document.

4.6.  Impact on Network Operation

   This document makes no change to the basic operations of PCEP and
   considerations described in [RFC5440] Section 8.6.  In addition to
   the limit on the rate of messages sent by a PCEP speaker, a limit MAY
   be placed on the size of the PCEP messages.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA assigns values to the PCEP protocol objects and TLVs.  IANA is
   requested to make some allocations for the newly defined objects and
   TLVs introduced in this document.  Also, IANA is requested to manage
   the space of flags that are newly added in the TLVs.

5.1.  PCEP Objects

   As described in Section 2.2 and Section 2.3new Objects are defined
   IANA is requested to make the following Object-Type allocations from
   the "PCEP Objects" sub-registry.


             Object Class to be assigned

             Reference    This document (section Section 2.3)

   As described in Section 2.4.1 a new Object type is defined IANA is
   requested to make the following Object-Type allocations from the
   "PCEP Objects" sub-registry.  The values here are suggested for use
   by IANA.

5.2.  END-POINTS object, Object Type Generalized Endpoint

   IANA is requested to create a registry to manage the endpoint type
   field of the END-POINTS object, Object Type Generalized Endpoint and
   manage the code space.

   New endpoint type in the Reserved range may be allocated by an IETF
   consensus action.  Each endpoint type should be tracked with the
   following qualities:

   o  endpoint type

   o  Description

   o  Defining RFC

   New endpoint type in the Experimental range are for experimental use;
   these will not be registered with IANA and MUST NOT be mentioned by
   RFCs.

   The following values have been defined by this document.
   (Section 2.4.1, Table 4):

   Value   Type                Meaning

   0       Point-to-Point

   1       Point-to-Multipoint New leaves to add

   5-244   Reserved

   245-255 Experimental range

5.3.  New PCEP TLVs

   IANA manages the PCEP TLV code point registry (see [RFC5440]).  This
   is maintained as the "PCEP TLV Type Indicators" sub-registry of the
   "Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry.  This
   document defines new PCEP TLVs, to be carried in the END-POINTS
   object with Generalized Endpoint object Type.  IANA is requested to
