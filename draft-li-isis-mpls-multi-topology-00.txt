1.  Introduction

   As the virtual network operators develop, it is desirable to provide
   better network virtualization solutions to facilitate the service
   provision.  [I-D.li-mpls-network-virtualization-framework] proposes a
   new framework to implement MPLS virtual network based on the
   architecture of central controlled IGP.  It is to allocate MPLS
   global label for the virtual network topologies, network nodes and
   links by an IGP controller to IGP clients.  Thus MPLS global labels
   becomes the unique identifications in the underlying networks to
   compose the virtual networks.

   This document defines the corresponding IS-IS protocol extensions and
   procedures to support MPLS virtual network topology.  The other
   document will define the corresponding IS-IS protocol extensions and
   procedures to support MPLS virtualized network nodes and links.

   Underlying Network: It is the network which the virtual network is
   built based on.  The underlying network can be the physical network
   or the virtual network.

   MPLS Virtual Network: The virtual network is built based on the
   underlying network.  It is composed by virtual nodes and virtual
   links which are identified by MPLS global label.  In this document,
   the concept of virtual network is the same as that of MPLS virtual
   network.

   MPLS Virtual Network Topology: It is the topology of the MPLS virtual
   network.  It can be identified multi-topology ID of corresponding
   virtual network.  MPLS global label is allocated to represent the
   virtual network topology.

3.  Overview

   [I-D.li-rtgwg-cc-igp-arch] defines the central controlled
   architecture for IGP.  In
   [I-D.li-mpls-network-virtualization-framework], a new framework is
   defined to implement MPLS virtual network based on central controlled
   IGP.  In the MPLS virtual network, the virtual network topology can
   be identified by the Multi-Topology ID.  The global label for the
   virtual network topology is allocated by the IGP controller and the
   label binding between the Multi-Topology ID and the Global Label are
   flooded from the IGP controller to IGP clients.  When IGP clients
   receives the label binding, it can install the MPLS forwarding entry
   to map the incoming label to the forwarding instance corresponding to
   the Multi-Topology.

3.1.  Application for MRT FRR

   MRT FRR [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture] has been proposed to
   provide 100% coverage of FRR deployment in the network.  There are
   two forwarding mechanisms defined in : IP tunnel forwarding mechanism
   and LDP Multi-Topology mechanism.  IP tunnel forwarding mechanism
   need to set up IP tunnels which must introduce extra IP addresses.
   It is difficult to satisfy the scalability requirement for
   deployment.  LDP Multi-Topology is a scalable way to implement the
   MRT FRR forwarding.  But for the pure IP network it has to introduce
   the new MPLS protocol.  Moreover, it may use more labels which are
   allocated for prefixes in three topologies: the default topology, the
   blue topology and the red topology.

   When the MPLS virtual network mechanism is introduced, the MRT FRR
   forwarding in the IP network can be simplified greatly.  Two MPLS
   global label can be allocated to identify the blue topology and the
   red topology.  According to MRT calculation, the forwarding instances

Internet-Draft        IS-IS Extensions for MPLS MT          October 2013


   for the default topology, the red topology and the blue topology can
   be installed.  For a specific IP prefix, the forwarding entry will
   consist of the primary path in the default topology and the secondary
   path in the red topology or the blue topology.  IP packets will
   forward hop by hop according to the FIB of the default topology.
   When failure happens, they will be forwarded in the blue topology or
   the red topology which contains the secondary path.  When forwarding,
   the global label for the Multi-Topology is encapsulated for the IP
   packets.  When the next hop node receives the packets, it will
   decapsulate the label and map to the corresponding forwarding
   instance of the red topology or the blue topology according to the
   MPLS forwarding entry.  When determine the outgoing interface and the
   next hop after looking up the Multi-Topology FIB according to the
   destination IP address, the packet will encapsulate the global label
   again which represent the red topology or the blue topology and will
   be forwarded to the next hop.  This forwarding process will be done
   by each node until it reaches the destination.

   In the MRT FRR process, there are only two MPLS forwarding entries to
   map the label to the red topology and the blue topology.  Moreover,
   it is done by IGP extensions instead of introducing LDP, which can
   also simplify the network operation and management.

4.  IS-IS Extensions

4.1.  IS-IS Label Mapping TLV

   A new IS-IS TLV, call as Label Mapping TLV, is introduced to allocate
   MPLS label.  The IS-IS Label Mapping TLV format is shown in the
   following figure.  The type of IS-IS Label Mapping TLV is to be
   defined by IANA.  The flags in the TLV are to be defined.  There are
   a series of sub-TLV in the TLV which length can be up to 252 octets.
   There MUST be at least one Label Sub-TLV and one FEC sub-TLV in the
   TLV.  The Label sub-TLV contains the label value allocated.  The FEC
   sub-TLV contains the Forwarding Equivalent Class for which the label
   is allocated.  In this document, one FEC sub-TLV is defined, called
   as MPLS Multi-Topology sub-TLV.

4.2.  Label Sub-TLV

   As defined in [I-D.li-mpls-global-label-framework], there are two
   types of methods to allocated global label: the first one is to use
   the existing MPLS label range, that is, from 16 to 2^20; the second
   one is to use the expanded MPLS label range which can be more than
   2^20.  Taking into account the future expansion, the Label Sub-TLV
   has following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3

                Figure 2: Label Sub-TLV Format


   o Type: 1 octet of sub-TLV type.  It is to be allocated by IANA.

   o Length: 1 octet of length of the value field of the sub-TLV.  It
   can be up to 252 octets.

   o MPLS Label Field: variable length.  It consists of one or more
   labels.  Each label is encoded as 3 octets, where the high-order 20
   bits contain the label value, and the low order bit contains "Bottom
   of Stack".

   The label stack in the Label sub-TLV can construct a big label range
   which can exceed 2^20.  If there is only one label field, it is
   consistent with the existing MPLS label range from 16 to 2^20.

4.3.  MPLS Multi-Topology Sub-TLV

   When implement virtual topology, the global label is allocated for
   the Multi-topology ID.  MPLS Multi-Topology ID can be seen as the FEC
   for the label mapping.  The MPLS Multi-Topology sub-TLV format has
   following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

     |      Type     |     Length    |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                Multi-Topology ID (32 bits)                    |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                Figure 3: Multi-Topology Sub- TLV format


   o Type: 1 octet of sub-TLV type.  It is to be allocated by IANA.

   o Length: 1 octet of length of the value field of the sub-TLV.  It is
   4.

   o Multi-Topology ID: 4 octets.  It contains the MPLS Multi-Topology
   ID for which the global label is allocated to implement virtual
   topology.

4.4.  Procedures

   When the IGP controller needs to implement the MPLS virtual network
   topology, the IGP controller MUST originate a new LSP comprising the
   Label Mapping TLV for the MPLS virtual network topology.  The Label
   Mapping TLV MUST contain one or more pairs of the Label sub-TLV and
   the Multi-Topology ID sub-TLV.  If the length of these sub-TLVs can
   exceeds 252 octets, there SHOULD be multiple Label Mapping TLVs in
   IS-IS LSP.

   When receiving the Label Mapping to implement the virtual network
   topology, the IGP clients SHOULD get the global label and the
   corresponding multi-topology from the sub-TLVs in the label mapping
   TLV and install MPLS fowarding entry accordingly.

5.  Compatibility

   Routers that do not support these MPLS Virtualization extensions
   SHOULD silently ignore the TLV and the sub-TLVs defined in this
   document.
