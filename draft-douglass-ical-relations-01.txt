1.  Introduction

   Icalendar entities often need to be related to each other or to
   associated meta-data.  These relationships can take the following
   forms

   Structured iCalendar:  Icalendar entities are related to each other
      in some structured way, for example as parent, sibling, before,
      after.

   Grouped iCalendar:  Icalendar entities are related to each other as a
      group.  CATEGORIES are often used for this purpose but are
      problematic for application developers.

   Linked:  Icalendar entities and non-iCalendar entities are linked to
      each other.

1.1.  Structured iCalendar relationships





Douglass                 Expires March 30, 2014                 [Page 2]

Internet-Draft           Icalendar Relationships          September 2013


   The currently existing iCalendar [RFC5545] RELATED-TO property has no
   support for temporal relationships as used by standard project
   management tools.

   The RELTYPE parameter is extended to take new values defining
   temporal relationships, a GAP parameter is defined to provide lead
   and lag values and RELATED-TO is extended to allow URI values.  These
   changes allows the RELATED-TO property to define a richer set of
   relationships useful for project management.

1.2.  Grouped iCalendar relationships

   This specification defines a new RELATED-ID property which allows
   arbitrary groups of entities to be created.  This provides a more
   structured approach to categorization, allowing namespaced values and
   providing some assurance for applications that these groupings will
   be preserved.

1.3.  Linked relationships

   The currently existing iCalendar standard [RFC5545] lacks a general
   purpose method for referencing additional, external information
   relating to calendar components.

   This document proposes a method for referencing typed external
   information that can provide additional information about an
   iCalendar component.  This new LINK property is closely aligned to
   the LINK header defined in [RFC5988]

   The LINK property defines a typed reference or relation to external
   meta-data or related resources.  By providing type and format
   information as parameters, clients and servers are able to discover
   interesting references and make use of them, perhaps for indexing or
   the presentation of interesting links for the user.

   It is often necessary to relate calendar components.  The current
   RELATED-TO property only allows for a UID which is inadequate for
   many purposes.  Allowing other types may help but might raise a
   number of backward compatibility issues.  The link property can link
   components in different collections or even on different servers.

   When publishing events it is useful to be able to refer back to the
   source of that information.  The actual event may have been consumed
   from a feed or an ics file on a web site.  A LINK property can
   provide a reference to the originator of the event.

   Beyond the need to relate elements temporally, project management
   tools often need to be able to specify the relationships between the

Internet-Draft           Icalendar Relationships          September 2013


   various events and tasks which make up a project.  The LINK property
   provides such a mechanism.

1.4.  Caching and offline use

   A section about offline use.  Use the link type to identify important
   pieces of data.

   Client may load subset of data due to e.g. a time-range query.
   Should it pull in all the related data?

1.5.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Reference Types

   The actual reference value can take three forms specified by the type
   parameter

   URI:  The default type.  This is a URI referring to the target.

   UID:  This allows for linking within a single collection and the
      value is assumed to be another component within that collection.

   REFERENCE:  An xpointer.  In an XML environment it may be necessary
      to refer to an external XML artifact.  The XPointer is defined in
      [W3C.WD-xptr-xpointer-20021219] and allows addressing portions of
      XML documents.

3.  Link Relation Types

   [RFC5988] defines two form of relation types, registered and
   extension.  Registered relation types are added to a registry defined
   by [RFC5988] while extension relation types are specified as unique
   unregistered URIs, (at least unregistered in the [RFC5988] registry).

   The relation types defined here will be registered with IANA in
   accordance with the specifications in [RFC5988].

4.  Redefined Relation Type Value

   Relationship parameter type values are defined in section 3.2.15. of
   [RFC5545].  This specification redefines that type to include the new
   temporal relationship values FINISHTOSTART, FINISHTOFINISH,
   STARTTOFINISH and STARTTOSTART.  It also adds the DEPENDS-ON value to
   provide a link to an component upon which the current component
   depends.

   Format Definition:

   This property parameter is defined by the following notation:

       reltypeparam       = "RELTYPE" "="
                           ("PARENT"    ; Parent relationship - Default
                          / "CHILD"     ; Child relationship
                          / "SIBLING"   ; Sibling relationship
                          / "DEPENDS-ON" ; refers to previous task
                          / "FINISHTOSTART" ;  Temporal relationship
                          / "FINISHTOFINISH" ;  Temporal relationship
                          / "STARTTOFINISH" ;  Temporal relationship
                          / "STARTTOSTART" ;  Temporal relationship
                          / iana-token  ; Some other IANA-registered
                                        ; iCalendar relationship type
                          / x-name)     ; A non-standard, experimental
                                        ; relationship type


   Description:  This parameter can be specified on a property that
      references another related calendar component.  The parameter may
      specify the hierarchical relationship type of the calendar
      component referenced by the property when the value is PARENT,
      CHILD or SIBLING.  If this parameter is not specified on an
      allowable property, the default relationship type is PARENT.
      Applications MUST treat x-name and iana-token values they don't
      recognize the same way as they would the PARENT value.

      It defines the temporal relationship when the value is one of the
      project management standard relationships FINISHTOSTART,
      FINISHTOFINISH, STARTTOFINISH or STARTTOSTART.  This property will
      be present in the predecessor entity and will refer to the
      successor entity.  The GAP parameter specifies the lead or lag
      time between the predecessor and the successor.  In the
      description of each temporal relationship below we refer to Task-A
      which contains and controls the relationship and Task-B the target
      of the relationship.

   RELTYPE=PARENT:  Identifies the referenced calendar component is a
      superior of calendar component

   RELTYPE=CHILD:  Indicates that the referenced calendar component is a
      subordinate of the calendar component.

   RELTYPE=SIBLING:  Indicates that the referenced calendar component is
      a peer of the calendar component.

   RELTYPE=DEPENDS-ON:  Indicates that the current calendar component
      depends on the referenced calendar component in some manner.  For
      example a task may be blocked waiting on the other, referenced,
      task.

   RELTYPE=FINISHTOSTART:  Task-B cannot start until Task-A finishes.
      For example, when sanding is complete, painting can begin.


               ============
               |  Task-A  |--+
               ============  |
                             |
                             V
                             ============
                             |  Task-B  |
                             ============

                  Figure 1: Finish to start relationship

   RELTYPE=FINISHTOFINISH:  Task-B cannot finish before Task-A is
      finished, that is the end of Task-A defines the end of Task-B.
      For example, we start the potatoes, then the meat then the peas
      but they should all be cooked at the same time.


                       ============
                       |  Task-A  |--+
                       ============  |
                                     |
                       ============  |
                       |  Task-B  |<-+
                       ============

                  Figure 2: Finish to finish relationship

   RELTYPE=STARTTOFINISH:  The start of Task-A (which occurs after
      Task-B) controls the finish of Task-B.  For example, ticket sales
      (Task-B) end when the game starts (Task-A).

                       ============

                  Figure 3: Start to finish relationship

   RELTYPE=STARTTOSTART:  The start of Task-A triggers the start of
      Task-B, that is Task-B can start anytime after Task-A starts.

     link            = "LINK" linkparam ":" ( ":" uri ) /
                       (
                         ";" "VALUE" "=" "REFERENCE"
                         ":" text

                     ; and MAY occur more than once

                     (";" relparam) /

                     ; the following are MANDATORY
                     ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                     (";" xparam)

                     )



   Example:

   The following is an example of this property.  It points to a server
   acting as the source for the calendar object.

                 LINK;REL=SOURCE;TITLE=The Egg:
                   http://example.com/events


7.2.  Related-id

   Property name:  RELATED-ID

   Purpose:  This property allows iCalendar entities to be grouped.

   Value type:  TEXT





Douglass                 Expires March 30, 2014                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft           Icalendar Relationships          September 2013


   Property Parameters:  Non-standard parameters can be specified on
      this property.

   Conformance:  This property MAY be specified multiple times in any
      iCalendar component.

   Description:  The value of this property is a namespaced value using
      Clark notation, that is the namespace is enclosed in braces, "{",
      "}".  The part following the namespace is defined by the owner of
      that namespace and may be simple text, a path or any appropriate
      text value.

      In effect this property provides a more controlled categorization
      of calendar entities.

      A CUA MUST preserve any RELATED-ID property with a namespace it
      does not recognize or own.  This allows other CUAs to use the
      RELATED-ID to define groups which only have significance to that
      application.  For example, a project management tol may flag all
      tasks that form part of a specific project, or an itinerary tool
      may flag all events that are part of an itinerary.

   Format Definition:

   This property is defined by the following notation:

     related-id      = "RELATED-ID" relidparam ":" text CRLF


     relidparam      = *(

                     ; the following is OPTIONAL
                     ; and MAY occur more than once

                     (";" xparam)

                     )



   Example:

   The following is an example of this property.  It defines an id in
   the org.calconnect namespace.

                  RELATED-ID:{org.calconnect.project}Main-Project

8.  Redefined RELATED-TO Property

8.1.  RELATED-TO

   Property name:  RELATED-TO

   Purpose:  This property is used to represent a relationship or
      reference between one calendar component and another.  The
      definition here extends the definition in Section 3.8.4.5. of
      [RFC5545] by allowing URI values adn a GAP parameter.

   Value type:  URI or TEXT

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard, reference type, gap, value or
      format type parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property MAY be specified in any iCalendar
      component.

   Description:  By default or when VALUE=UID is specified, the property
      value consists of the persistent, globally unique identifier of
      another calendar component.  This value would be represented in a
      calendar component by the "UID" property.

      By default, the property value points to another calendar
      component that has a PARENT relationship to the referencing
      object.  The "RELTYPE" property parameter is used to either
      explicitly state the default PARENT relationship type to the
      referenced calendar component or to override the default PARENT
      relationship type and specify either a CHILD or SIBLING
      relationship or a temporal relationship.

      The PARENT relationship indicates that the calendar component is a
      subordinate of the referenced calendar component.  The CHILD
      relationship indicates that the calendar component is a superior
      of the referenced calendar component.  The SIBLING relationship
      indicates that the calendar component is a peer of the referenced
      calendar component.

      The FINISHTOSTART, FINISHTOFINISH, STARTTOFINISH or STARTTOSTART
      relationships define temporal relationships as specified in the
      reltype parameter definition.

      Changes to a calendar component referenced by this property can
      have an implicit impact on the related calendar component.  For
      example, if a group event changes its start or end date or time,
      then the related, dependent events will need to have their start
      and end dates changed in a corresponding way.  Similarly, if a

      PARENT calendar component is cancelled or deleted, then there is
      an implied impact to the related CHILD calendar components.  This
      property is intended only to provide information on the
      relationship of calendar components.  It is up to the target
      calendar system to maintain any property implications of this
      relationship.

   Format Definition:

   This property is defined by the following notation:

      related    = "RELATED-TO" relparam ( ":" text ) /
                   (
                     ";" "VALUE" "=" "UID"
                     ":" uid
                   )
                   (
                     ";" "VALUE" "=" "URI"
                     ":" uri
                   )
                   CRLF

      relparam   = *(
                 ;
                 ; The following are OPTIONAL,
                 ; but MUST NOT occur more than once.
                 ;
                 (";" reltypeparam) /
                 (";" gapparam) /
                 ;
                 ; The following is OPTIONAL,
                 ; and MAY occur more than once.
                 ;
                 (";" other-param)
                 ;
                 )
