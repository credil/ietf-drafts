Internet-Draft         64 Multicast Address Format              May 2012


1.  Introduction

   Various solutions (e.g., [I-D.ietf-softwire-mesh-multicast],
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-multicast]) have been proposed to allow
   access to IPv4 multicast content from hosts attached to IPv6-enabled
   domains.  Even if these solutions have distinct applicability scopes
   (translation vs. encapsulation) and target different use cases, they
   all make use of specific IPv6 multicast addresses to embed an IPv4
   multicast address.  Particularly, the IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast
   address is used as a destination IPv6 address of multicast flows
   received from an IPv4-enabled domain and injected by the IPv4-IPv6
   Interconnection Function into an IPv6-enabled domain.  It is also
   used to build an IPv6 multicast state (*, G6) or (S6, G6)
   corresponding to their (*, G4) or (S4, G4) IPv4 counter parts by the
   IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection Function.  [I-D.ietf-mboned-v4v6-mcast-ps]
   provides more discussion about issues related to IPv4/IPv6 multicast.

   This document specifies an extension to the IPv6 multicast addressing
   architecture to be used in the context of IPv4-IPv6 interconnection.
   In particular, this document defines an address format for IPv4-
   embedded IPv6 multicast addresses.  This address format can be used
   for IPv4-IPv6 translation or encapsulation schemes.

   This document updates [RFC4291].  A new M-bit is defined; if set to
   "1", it indicates an IPv4 multicast address is embedded in the low-
   order 32 bits of the IPv6 multicast address.  Appendix A.1 enumerates
   the arguments in favor of defining an address format while
   Appendix A.2 discusses why identifying an IPv4-embedded IPv6
   multicast address is needed.

   This specification can be used in conjunction with other extensions
   such as building unicast prefix-based multicast IPv6 address
   [RFC3306] or embedding the rendezvous point [RFC3956].

   This document is a companion document to [RFC6052] which focuses
   exclusively on IPv4-embedded IPv6 unicast addresses.

   Details about design choices are documented in Appendix A.


2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   o  IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address: denotes a multicast IPv6
      address which includes in 32 bits an IPv4 address.  Two types of
      IPv6 addresses are defined that carry an IPv4 address in the low-
      order 32 bits of the address.  The format to build such addresses

Internet-Draft         64 Multicast Address Format              May 2012


      is defined in Section 3 for Any Source Multicast (ASM) mode and
      Section 4 for Source Specific Multicast (SSM) mode.

   o  Multicast Prefix64 (or MPREFIX64 for short) refers to an IPv6
      multicast prefix to be used to construct IPv4-embedded IPv6
      multicast addresses.  This prefix is used to build an IPv4-
      embedded IPv6 multicast address as defined in Section 8.
      Section 8 specifies also how to extract an IPv4 address from an
      IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address.

   o  ASM_MPREFIX64: denotes a multicast Prefix64 used in ASM mode.  It
      follows the format described in Section 3.

   o  SSM_MPREFIX64: denotes a multicast Prefix64 used in SSM mode.  It
      follows the format described in Section 4.

   o  IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection Function: refers to a function which is
      enabled in a node interconnecting an IPv4-enabled domain with an
      IPv6-enabled one.  It can be located in various places of the
      multicast network.  Particularly, in terms of multicast control
      messages, it can be an IGMP/MLD Interworking Function or an IPv4-
      IPv6 PIM Interworking Function.  An IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection
      Function is configured with one or two MPREFIX64s.


3.  IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Multicast Address Format: ASM Mode

   To meet the requirements listed in Appendix A.4, the IPv6 multicast
   address format defined in [RFC4291] is modified to enclose an IPv4
   multicast address.  Figure 1 shows the modified address format when
   ASM mode is used.

    |   8    |  4 |  4 |  4 |             76               |    32    |
    +--------+----+----+----+------------------------------+----------+
    |11111111|flgs|scop|64IX|         sub-group-id         |v4 address|
    +--------+----+----+----+-----------------------------------------+
                                                  +-+-+-+-+
    IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection bits (64IX):        |M|resvd|
                                                  +-+-+-+-+
    "resvd" are reserved bits.


      Figure 1: IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Multicast Address Format: ASM Mode

   The description of the fields is as follows:
   o  "flgs" and "scop" fields are defined in [RFC4291].

Internet-Draft         64 Multicast Address Format              May 2012


   o  64IX field (IPv4-IPv6 interconnection bits): The first bit is the
      M-bit.  When "M-bit" is set to 1, it indicates that a multicast
      IPv4 address is embedded in the low-order 32 bits of the multicast
      IPv6 address.  All the remaining bits are reserved and MUST be set
      to 0.
   o  sub-group-id: This field is configurable according to local
      policies (e.g., enable embedded-RP) of the entity managing the
      IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection Function.  This field MUST follow the
      recommendations specified in [RFC3306] if unicast-based prefix is
      used or the recommendations specified in [RFC3956] if embedded-RP
      is used.  The default value is all zeros.
   o  The low-order 32 bits MUST include an IPv4 multicast address when
      the M-bit is set to 1.  The enclosed IPv4 multicast address SHOULD
      NOT be in 232/8 range.


4.  IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Multicast Address Format: SSM Mode

   As mentioned in Appendix A.4, any IPv4-embedded IPv6 address used in
   SSM mode MUST be part of ff3x::/32 [RFC4607].  Figure 2 describes the
   format of the IPv6 multicast address to be used to enclose an IPv4
   multicast address.

    |   8    |  4 |  4 |    16     |  4 |       60         |    32    |
    +--------+----+----+-----------+----+------------------+----------+
    |11111111|0011|scop|00.......00|64IX|   sub-group-id   |v4 address|
    +--------+----+----+-----------+----+------------------+----------+
                                                  +-+-+-+-+
    IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection bits (64IX):        |M|resvd|
                                                  +-+-+-+-+
    "resvd" are reserved bits.

      Figure 2: IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Multicast Address Format: SSM Mode

   The description of the fields is as follows:

   o  Flags MUST be set to 0011.
   o  "scop" is defined in [RFC4291].
   o  64IX field (IPv4-IPv6 interconnection bits): Same meaning as
      Section 3.
   o  sub-group-id: The default value is all zeros.
   o  The low-order 32 bits MUST include an IPv4 multicast address when
      the M-bit is set to 1.  The embedded IPv4 address SHOULD be in the
      232/8 range [RFC4607].

Internet-Draft         64 Multicast Address Format              May 2012


5.  Textual Representation

   The embedded IPv4 address in an IPv6 multicast address is included in
   the last 32 bits; therefore dotted decimal notation can be used.


6.  Multicast PREFIX64

   For the delivery of the IPv4-IPv6 multicast interconnection services,
   a dedicated multicast prefix denoted as MPREFIX64 should be
   provisioned (e.g., using NETCONF or
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-multicast-prefix-option]) to any function
   requiring to build an IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address based on
   an IPv4 multicast address.  MPREFIX64 can be of ASM or SSM type.
   When both modes are used, two prefixes are required to be
   provisioned.

   The structure of the MPREFIX64 follows the guidelines specified in
   Section 3 for the ASM mode and Section 4 when SSM mode is used.

   The length of MPREFIX64 MUST be /96 (as shown in Figure 3).

   The format of the MPREFIX64 should follow what is specified in
   [RFC3306] and [RFC3956] if corresponding mechanisms are used.

      The format specified in Section 3 uses some reserved bits defined
      in [RFC3306] and [RFC3956]: the first of the reserved bits now has
      a meaning, while the remaining bits MUST be set to 0.

7.  Source IPv4 Address in the IPv6 Realm

   An IPv4 source is represented in the IPv6 realm with its IPv4-
   converted IPv6 address [RFC6052].


8.  Address Translation Algorithm

   IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast addresses are composed according to the
   following algorithm:
   o  Concatenate the MPREFIX64 and the 32 bits of the IPv4 address to
      obtain a 128-bit address.

   The IPv4 multicast addresses are extracted from the IPv4-embedded
   IPv6 multicast addresses according to the following algorithm:
   o  If the multicast address belongs to ff3x:0:8000/33 or ffxx:
      8000/17, extract the last 32 bits of the IPv6 multicast address.

10.  IANA Considerations

   Authors of this document request to reserve:
   o  ff3x:0:8000/33 SSM block to embed an IPv4 multicast address in the
      last 32 bits.
   o  ffxx:8000/17 ASM block to embed an IPv4 multicast address in the
      last 32 bits.


11.  Security Considerations

   This document defines an address format to embed an IPv4 multicast
   address in an IPv6 multicast address.  The same security
   considerations as those discussed in [RFC6052] are to be taken into
   consideration.

Appendix A.  Design Choices

A.1.  Why an Address Format is Needed for Multicast IPv4-IPv6
      Interconnection?

   Arguments why an IPv6 address format is needed to embed multicast
   IPv4 address are quite similar to those of [RFC6052].  Concretely,
   the definition of a multicast address format embedding a multicast
   IPv4 address allows:

   o  Stateless IPv4-IPv6 header translation of multicast flows;
   o  Stateless IPv4-IPv6 PIM interworking function;
   o  Stateless IGMP-MLD interworking function (e.g., required for an
      IPv4 receiver to access to IPv4 multicast content via an IPv6
      network);
   o  Stateless (local) synthesis of IPv6 address when IPv4 multicast
      address are embedded in application payload (e.g., SDP [RFC4566]);
   o  Except the provisioning of the same MPREFIX64, no coordination is
      required between IPv4-IPv6 PIM interworking function, IGMP-MLD
      interworking function, IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection Function and any
      ALG (Application Level Gateway) in the path;
   o  Minimal operational constraints on the multicast address
      management: IPv6 multicast addresses can be constructed using what
      has been deployed for IPv4 delivery mode.

A.2.  Why Identifying an IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Multicast Address is
      Required?

   Reserving an M-bit in the IPv6 multicast address (which is equivalent
   to reserving a dedicated multicast block for IPv4-IPv6
   interconnection purposes) is a means to guide the address selection
   process at the receiver side; in particular it assists the receiver
   to select the appropriate IP multicast address while avoiding to
   involve an IPv4-IPv6 interconnection function in the path.

   Two use cases to illustrate this behavior are provided below:

   1.  An ALG is required to help an IPv6 receiver to select the
       appropriate IP address when only the IPv4 address is advertised
       (e.g., using SDP); otherwise the access to the IPv4 multicast
       content can not be offered to the IPv6 receiver.  The ALG may be
       located downstream the receiver.  As such, the ALG does not know
       in advance whether the receiver is dual-stack or IPv6-only.  The
       ALG may be tuned to insert both the original IPv4 address and
       corresponding IPv6 multicast address.  If the M-bit is not used,
       a dual-stack receiver may prefer to use the IPv6 address to
       receive the multicast content.  This address selection would
       require multicast flows to cross an IPv4-IPv6 interconnection
       function.
   2.  In order to avoid involving an ALG in the path, an IPv4-only
       source can advertise both its IPv4 address and IPv4-embedded IPv6
       multicast address.  If the M-bit is not used, a dual-stack
       receiver may prefer to use the IPv6 address to receive the
       multicast content.  This address selection would require
       multicast flows to cross an IPv4-IPv6 interconnection function.
   Reserving an M-bit in the IPv6 multicast address for IPv4-IPv6
   interconnection purposes mitigates the issues discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-nat64-learn-analysis] in a multicast context.

A.3.  Location of the IPv4 Address

   There is no strong argument to allow for flexible options to encode
   the IPv4 address inside the multicast IPv6 address.  The option
   retained by the authors is to encode the multicast IPv4 address in
   the low-order 32 bits of the IPv6 address.

   This choice is also motivated by the need to be compliant with
   [RFC3306] and [RFC3956].

A.4.  Location of the M-bit

   defined in [RFC4291]:

   It was tempting to use the remaining flag to indicate whether an IPv6
   address embeds an IPv4 address or not.  This choice has been
   abandoned by the authors for various reasons:
   o  ff3x::/32 is defined as SSM.  Defining a new flag would require
      standards and implementations to also treat ffbx::/32 as SSM.
   o  Prefixes starting with ff7x are defined as embedded-RP, but not
      prefixes starting with fffx.  Below is provided an excerpt from
      [RFC3956]:
         " ...the encoding and the protocol mode used when the two high-
         order bits in "flgs" are set to 11 ("fff0::/12") is
         intentionally unspecified until such time that the highest-
         order bit is defined.  Without further IETF specification,
         implementations SHOULD NOT treat the fff0::/12 range as
         Embedded-RP."
         as such defining a new flag would require implementations to
         also treat ff7x::/12 as embedded-RP prefix.
   o  This is the last remaining flag and at this stage we are not sure
      whether there is other usage scenarios of the flag.

   As a conclusion, the remaining flag is not used to indicate an IPv6
   multicast address embeds an IPv4 multicast address.  However the
   following constraints should be met:

      (1) Belong to ff3x::/32 and be compatible with unicast-based
      prefix [RFC3306] for SSM.  Note that [RFC3306] suggests to set
      "plen" to 0 and "network-prefix" to 0.
      (2) Be compatible with embedded-RP [RFC3956] and unicast-based
      prefix [RFC3306] for ASM;
      (3) Avoid ff3x::4000:0001-ff3x::7fff:ffff which is reserved for
      IANA.
   Meeting (1) and (2) with the same location of the M-bit is not
   feasible without modifying embedded-RP and unicast-based prefix
   specifications; this option is avoided.

   As a consequence, two multicast blocks are proposed to be used when

   embedding IPv4 address: one block for ASM (Section 3 ) and another
   one for the SSM (Section 4).

A.5.  Encapsulation vs. Translation

   IPv4-IPv6 encapsulator and translator may be embedded in the same
   device or even implemented with the same software module.  In order
   to help the function whether an encapsulated IPv6 multicast packets
   or translated IPv6 ones are to be transferred.  It was tempting to
   define an S-bit for that purpose but this choice has been abandoned
   in favor of the recommendation to use distinct MPREFIX64 for each
   scheme.

   As such, there is no need to reserve a bit in the IPv6 multicast
   address to separate between the translation and the encapsulation
   schemes.
