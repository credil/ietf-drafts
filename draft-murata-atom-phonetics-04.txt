        Representing phonetics for Japanese names in Atom feeds
                     draft-murata-atom-phonetics-04

Abstract

   This specification introduces an attribute for representing Japanese
   phonetics within feeds of the Atom Syndication Format [RFC4287].
   Such phonetics MAY be attached to author names and article titles.
   This attribute is applicable to OPDS(Open Publication Distribution
   System)[OPDS], which is based on Atom.

Internet-Draft               PhoneticsInAtom              September 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Japanese language uses kanji (CJK ideographic characters) and
   kana(Japanese phonetic characters).  A human name or article title is
   often represented by two strings: one with kanji and another without
   kanji.  The latter is used to unambiguously specify the phonetics of
   the human name or article title.  More about this issue, see
   [Miyazawa].

   The Atom Syndication Format [RFC4287] does not provide mechanisms for
   representing a name in more than one language or script.  As a
   solution specialized to Japanese phonetics, this specification
   introduces an attribute for representing the phonetics for a Japanese
   author name or article title.  This attribute is applicable to
   OPDS(Open Publication Distribution System)[OPDS], which is based on
   Atom.

2.  The phonetics attribute

      _Namespace:_ http://www.jepa.or.jp/xmlns/atomPhonetics/1.0

      _Local name:_ phonetics

      _Parent element:_ atom:name, atom:title, and atom:subTitle

      _Cardinality:_ 0 or 1

      _Permissible values:_ Strings in the Japanese language without CJK
      ideographic characters.  Such strings typically consists of
      Katakana or Hiragana characters but may include digits, symbols
      and Latin alphabets.  [NDL] gives one way to create the phonetics
      of a given name and shows commonly used characters for phonetics.

   <feed
        xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
        xmlns:jepa="http://www.jepa.or.jp/xmlns/atomPhonetics/1.0">
     <title
          jepa:phonetics="XML&#x30cb;&#x30e5;&#x30a6;&#x30e2;&#x30f3;"
                              >XML&#x5165;&#x9580;
     </title>
     <author>
         <name jepa:phonetics="&#x30e0;&#x30e9;&#x30bf;"
                         >&#x6751;&#x7530;</name>
     </author>
      ...
   </feed>


   "&#x30cb;&#x30e5;&#x30a6;&#x30e2;&#x30f3;" and
   "&#x30e0;&#x30e9;&#x30bf;" are Katakana strings, while
   "&#x5165;&#x9580;" and "&#x6751;&#x7530;" are CJK ideographic
   character strings.

3.  RELAX NG schema

   The original schema (atom.rnc) allows any foreign attribute, and is
   thus usable for validating feeds containing the attribute for
   Japanese phonetics.  However, the following schema is provided as an
   extension of the original schema for explicitly allowing the
   phonetics attribute for name, title, and subtitle elements and no
   other elements.  Instead of the original schema, this schema MAY be
   used for validating atom feeds having phonetics.

   namespace atom = "http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
   namespace jepa = "http://www.jepa.or.jp/xmlns/atomPhonetics/1.0"
   namespace local = ""
   include "atom.rnc" {
       undefinedAttribute =
           attribute * - (xml:base | xml:lang | local:* | jepa:*) { text }
       atomPersonConstruct =
           atomCommonAttributes,
           (element atom:name {attribute jepa:phonetics {text }?, text }
             & element atom:uri { atomUri }?
             & element atom:email { atomEmailAddress }?
             & extensionElement*)
       atomTitle =
           element atom:title
                 {attribute jepa:phonetics { text }?, atomTextConstruct }
       atomSubtitle =
           element atom:subtitle
                 {attribute jepa:phonetics { text }?, atomTextConstruct }

4.  Schematron schema

   This additional schema is provided for explicitly allowing the
   phonetics attribute for name, title, and subtitle elements and no
   other elements.  This schema MAY be used for validating atom feeds
   having phonetics.  It MAY be used together with the original schema
   (atom.rnc) or schemas for OPDS.

               <assert test="($ln='name')
                              or ($ln='title')
                              or ($ln = 'subTitle') "
                   >The jepa:phonetics attribute is allowed only
                    for atom:name, atom:title, and atom:subTitle
