Internet-Draft    Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute for UDP  February 2013 
 
    
1. Introduction 

   [RFC5512] specifies a method by which Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) 
   speakers can signal tunnel encapsulation information to each other 
   and accordingly it defines support for Generic Routing Encapsulation 
   (GRE)[RFC2784], Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3) 
   [RFC3931] and IP in IP [RFC2003] tunnel types. This document builds 
   on [RFC5512] and defines support for the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) 
   tunnel type which is applicable to at least the following two 
   application cases: IP-in-UDP encapsulation [IP-IN-UDP] and MPLS-in-
   UDP encapsulation [MPLS-IN-UDP]. 

2. Terminology 

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC5512].  

3. BGP Tunnel Type Code for UDP  

   To use either the Encapsulation Subsequent Address Family Identifier 
   (SAFI) or the BGP Encapsulation Extended Community defined in 
   [RFC5512] to signal the UDP tunnel type information across BGP 
   speakers, a new Tunnel Type code (TBD) indicating the UDP tunnel 
   type needs to be assigned by IANA.  

   This document does not specify any UDP tunnel specific sub-TLV. 
   Furthermore, the BGP Encapsulation Network Layer Reachability 
   Information (NLRI) Format is not modified by this document. 

4. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations mentioned in [RFC5512] is applicable to 
   this new BGP Tunnel Type code for UDP tunnels as well. No new 
   security risk is introduced by this new Tunnel Type code for UDP 
   tunnels. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   A new BGP Tunnel Type code indicating the UDP tunnel type needs to 
   be assigned by IANA. 

6. Acknowledgements 

   Thanks to.
