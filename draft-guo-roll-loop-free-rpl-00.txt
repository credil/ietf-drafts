Abstract

   IETF has been developing IPv6 based standards for Low-power and Lossy
   Networks (LLNs) to meet requirements of constrained applications,
   such as field monitoring, inventory control and so on. IPv6 Routing
   Protocol for LLNs (RPL) has been published in [RFC6550]. Based on
   routing metrics and constraints [RFC6551], RPL builds Directed
   Acyclic Graph (DAG) topology to establish bidirectional routes for
   LLNs for traffic types of multipoint-to-point, point-to-multipoint,
   and point-to-point. RPL routes are optimized for traffic to or from
   one or more roots that act as sinks. As a result, a DAG is
   partitioned into one or more Destination Oriented DAGs (DODAGs), one
   DODAG per sink. RPL is widely considered as a feasible routing
   protocol for LLNs. However, DODAG loops and lack of a loop free DODAG
   local repair mechanism are two open issues to be addressed. This
   draft introduces an alternative rank and an Objective Function to
   eliminate DODAG loops in RPL. Based on the proposed rank and
   Objective Function, this draft introduces a loop free DODAG local
   repair mechanism.

1.  Introduction

   Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of networks in which
   nodes and their communication links are constrained. LLN nodes
   typically operate with constrains on processing power, physical size,
   memory, power consumption, lifetime, and rate of activity. Their
   communication links are characterized by high loss rate, low data
   rate, instability, low transmission power, and short transmission
   range. There can be from a few dozen up to thousands of nodes within
   a LLN. Routing in LLNs is different from routing in mobile ad-hoc
   networks. IETF has developed an IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL)
   in [RFC6550]. RPL supports multipoint-to-point traffic and point-to-
   multipoint traffic. The support for point-to-point traffic is also
   available.

   RPL builds Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) topology, which is
   partitioned into one or more Destination Oriented  DAGs (DODAGs).
   DODAG is basic logical structure in RPL. RPL nodes construct and
   maintain DODAG through the DODAG Information Object (DIO) message
   which is transmitted via link-local multicasting by using the Trickle
   timer [RFC6206]. The sink in a DODAG is called the DODAG root. RPL
   defines rules to transmit the DIO messages within a DODAG. The DODAG
   root configures the DODAG parameters including RPLInstanceID,
   DODAGVersionNumber, DODAGID, Rank, etc. and advertises the DODAG
   parameters in the DIO messages. To join a DODAG, a node selects a set
   of DODAG parents, on the routes towards the DODAG root, and a
   preferred DODAG parent as the preferred next hop node for upward
   traffic. Once a node joins a DODAG, it transmits DIO messages to
   advertise the DODAG parameters.

   The traffic inside a LLN flows along the edges of the DODAG, either
   upward or downward. In RPL, upward routes, having the DODAG root as
   destination, are provided by the DODAG construction mechanism using
   DIO messages. Downward routes, from the DODAG root to any other
   destination, are provided by these destinations transmitting the
   Destination Advertisement Object (DAO) messages. 

   Three different modes of operation (MOP) for downward routes are
   specified in [RFC6550]:

     1) No downward routes maintained by RPL.
     2) Storing mode of operation in which each router stores downward
      routing tables for its sub-DODAG. In Storing mode, the DAO message
      is sent to DAO parents. A node unicasts the DAO messages to the
      selected parent(s). Transmission of the DAO messages propagates
      from the nodes towards the DODAG root, where each intermediate
      router adds its downward routing stack to the DAO messages. In
      Storing mode, downward traffic is sent by using the downward

      routing tables.
     3) Non-Storing mode of operation in which only the DODAG root
      stores routes to all nodes in the network. In Non-Storing mode,
      the DAO message is sent to the DODAG root. A node unicasts the DAO
      messages to the DODAG root, which then calculates routes to all
      destinations by piecing together the information collected from
      the DAO messages. In Non-Storing mode, downward traffic is sent by
      way of source routing.

   An RPL node may act as a leaf node or as a router. RPL defines
   operation rules for both leaf node and router in [RFC6550]. For
   example, a leaf node does not extend DODAG connectivity. An RPL
   router needs to implement Trickle [RFC6206]. An RPL router
   implementation needs to support the MOP in use by the DODAG, that is,
   support for upward routes only or support for upward routes and
   downward routes in Storing mode or support for upward routes and
   downward routes in Non-Storing mode.  

   RPL has been implemented and tested. It has been shown that DODAG
   loops occur quite often [83rd IETF Meeting Presentation]. The cause
   of DODAG loops comes from rank increase. This draft introduces an
   alternative rank and an Objective Function to eliminate DODAG loops
   in RPL. In this draft, a node's rank never increases, even if a
   parent becomes unreachable. As a result, the introduced rank and
   Objective Function prevent DODAG loops from occurring. This draft
   also introduces a method for repairing DODAG locally without causing
   any DODAG loop. The DODAG local repair method applies to both Storing
   and Non-Storing modes of operation in RPL.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Additionally, this draft employs terminologies defined in [RFC6550],
   and extends following terminologies:

   DIO: DODAG Information Object in which the rank is represented by two
         integers.

   Up: Up refers to the direction from leaf node or router towards the
         DODAG root.

   Down: Down refers to the direction from the DODAG root towards leaf
         node or router.

   This draft introduces the following new terminologies:

   DRQ: DODAG Repair Request

   DRP: DODAG Repair Reply

   Rank_DRQ: The rank of the node generating the DRQ message.

   Rank_DRP: The rank of the node transmitting the DRP message.

   DRQID: IPv6 address of the node generating DRQ message.

   DRSN: Sequence number of the DRQ message of the node generating DRQ
         message.

3.  Alternative Rank

   In RPL, the rank plays very important role in the DODAG construction
   and maintenance. The rank of a node defines a position of the node
   relative to other nodes with respect to the DODAG root. Each node
   maintains its own rank. The DODAG root has the lowest rank. Nodes
   maintain their ranks based on parent-child relationship such that a
   child must have a rank strictly greater than ranks of all its DODAG
   parents. The DODAG root has no parent. The acyclic structure of the
   DODAG is guaranteed as long as the rank of any node is strictly
   greater than ranks of its DODAG parents. It is safe for a node to
   decrease its rank, as long as its rank remains greater than the ranks
   of its DODAG parents. However, the increase in rank increase can
   cause DODAG loops. RPL allows rank increase which is the source of
   DODAG loops in RPL. A node's rank increase may also cause all nodes
   in sub-DODAG to increase their ranks, which may lead to instability
   in the rank values.

3.1.  Alternative Rank Definition

   DODAG loops in RPL can be avoided if nodes do not increase their
   ranks. In order to meet this restriction, this draft defines the rank
   of a node as a proper fraction: 

                             Rank = m/n	(1)

   where m and n are integers such that 0 <= m < n. 

   The principle of this alternative rank definition comes from the fact
   that there are an infinite number of proper fractions between any two
   proper fractions. This guarantees that a node can decrease its rank
   for any number of times and still keep its rank greater than ranks of
   its DODAG parents.

   In this draft, a node maintains its rank as two integers, that is,

   numerator and denominator. The fractional value is used in rank
   operations, such as rank comparison.

   The ROOT_RANK is defined as 0/1 and maintained as 0 and 1. The DODAG
   root sets its rank to ROOT_RANK. The INFINITE_RANK is defined as 1/1
   and maintained as 1 and 1. The INFINITE_RANK can not be advertised in
   the DIO messages by any node.

3.2.  Rank Split Operation

   For any two ranks R1 = m/n and R2 = p/q, the rank split operation is
   defined as:

                      sp(R1, R2) = (m+p)/(n+q)	(2)

   It can be shown that if R1 < R2, then R1 < sp(R1,R2) < R2. That is,
   the split operation splits two ranks R1 and R2 and generates a new
   rank sp(R1,R2) that is in between R1 and R2.

4.  ICMPv6 RPL Control Message Extension

   This draft uses RPL control messages defined in [RFC6550] except the
   DIO message. The rank is advertised in the RPL control message using
   two integers, numerator and denominator, instead of the fractional
   value. As a result, the format of DIO Base Object is modified. In
   addition, to repair a DODAG locally, two new RPL control messages,
   DODAG Repair Request (DRQ) message and DODAG Repair Reply (DRP)
   message, are introduced. RPL control message format is defined in
   Figure 6 and Figure 7 of [RFC6550]. The code field for the DRQ and
   DRP messages needs to be assigned by IANA. The message base for DRQ
   and DRP are defined as follows.

5.  DODAG Construction

   In RPL, a DODAG is uniquely identified by the (RPLInstanceID,
   DODAGID) tuple and a DODAG Version is uniquely identified by the
   (RPLInstanceID, DODAGID, DODAGVersionNumber) tuple. The
   DODAGVersionNumber is monotonically incremented by the DODAG root. 

   To construct a new DODAG, the DODAG root configures DODAG parameters
   and transmits a DIO message with new (RPLInstanceID, DODAGID) tuple.
   To construct a new DODAG Version, the DODAG root transmits a DIO
   message with an increased DODAGVersionNumber. The DIO message is
   transmitted via link-local multicasting to all-RPL-nodes. Nodes
   obtain the DODAG parameters configured by the DODAG root in received
   DIO messages.   

   Upon receiving a DIO message transmitted by the DODAG root containing
   new (RPLInstanceID, DODAGID) tuple or new DODAGVersionNumber, the
   first hop neighboring nodes of the DODAG root may decide to join new

   DODAG or new DODAG Version advertised in received DIO message. To do
   so, the first hop nodes add the DODAG root into their DODAG parent
   set and store the DODAG parameters advertised in received DIO
   message. The first hop nodes keep all DODAG parameters unchanged
   except the rank. The first hop nodes set their ranks such that their
   ranks > ROOT_RANK and their ranks <= sp(ROOT_RANK, INFINITE_RANK).
   Upon joining a new DODAG or a new DODAG Version, the first hop
   routers generate and transmit the DIO messages by following rules
   specified in [RFC6550] to advertise the DODAG parameters. A router
   must not transmit the DIO messages for DODAG Versions of which it is
   not a member. A router that is not the DODAG root must not change the
   DODAG parameters received in DIO messages except the rank and DTSN
   fields. All other DODAG parameters, such as the DODAGID and
   DODAGVersionNumber, must be propagated unchanged down the DODAG as
   nodes join new DODAG or new DODAG Version.

   Upon receiving the DIO messages transmitted by the first hop
   neighboring routers, the second hop neighboring nodes of the DODAG
   root that want to join new DODAG or new DODAG Version perform same
   procedure as the first hop neighboring nodes do. However, in this
   case, the second hop nodes may receive multiple DIO messages from the
   first hop routers within the same DODAG or DODAG Version. The second
   hop nodes use received DIO messages to calculate their ranks and
   select a subset of the DIO message senders as their DODAG parents. To
   calculate its rank, a second hop node find the maximum rank,
   Rank_Max, among all ranks of its DODAG parents and sets its rank such
   that its rank > Rank_Max and its rank <= sp(Rank_Max, INFINITE_RANK).
   The second hop routers then generate and transmit the DIO messages
   same as the first hop router do.   

   It is possible that a first hop neighboring node of the DODAG root
   may also receive the DIO messages transmitted by other first hop
   neighboring routers. The first hop node may perform same procedure as
   the second hop nodes do to select more DODAG parents and calculate
   its rank.

   This DIO message propagation process continues until all nodes
   receive the DIO messages, select the DODAG parents and store their
   DODAG parameters, that is, the DODAG is completely constructed.

   Among its DODAG parents, a node selects one preferred DODAG parent to
   be used as the preferred next hop node along upward routes to the
   DODAG root. A node also selects some of its DODAG parents as its DAO
   parents and schedules the DAO transmission.

6.  DOADG Local Repair

   When a DODAG parent becomes unreachable, a node may switch to another

   DODAG parent for upward traffic. DODAG may be locally repaired by the
   node transmitting a DRQ message. The DRQ message is transmitted by
   the DRQ message generator via link-local multicasting to all-RPL-
   nodes.

   Upon receiving a DRQ message, a link-local neighboring router which
   is not the DODAG root discards the DRQ message if it does not have
   any DODAG parent. If the link-local neighboring router is the DODAG
   root, it accepts the DRQ message and generates a DRP message. If the
   link-local neighboring router is not the DODAG root and has a non-
   empty DODAG parent set and its rank is lower than Rank_DRQ (=
   Rank_N/Rank_D), it accepts the DRQ message and generates a DRP
   message. If the link-local neighboring router is not the DODAG root
   and has a non-empty DODAG parent set and its rank is greater than or
   equal to Rank_DRQ, it forwards the DRQ message to its preferred DODAG
   parent. This forwarding process continues until the DRQ message is
   discarded by a router that has an empty DODAG parent set or the DRQ
   message reaches a router which is either the DODAG root or a router
   that has a non-empty DODAG parent set and a rank lower than Rank_DRQ,
   a DRP message is then generated.  

   The DRP message is unicasted. In Storing mode, the DRP message
   generator transmits the DRP message to the DRQ message generator by
   using a downward routing table. In Non-Storing mode, the DRP message
   is forwarded up to the DODAG root, which then transmits the DRP
   message down to the DRQ message generator by using source routing.

6.1.  DODAG Local Repair in Storing Mode

   In Storing mode, if a DODAG parent becomes unreachable, a node
   removes that DODAG parent from its DODAG parent set. 

   If the updated DODAG parent set becomes empty, the node shall
   transmit a DRQ message to discover new DODAG parents. 

   If the updated DODAG parent set is not empty, the node checks if the
   removed DODAG parent is its preferred DODAG parent. If yes, the node
   shall select a new preferred DODAG parent. Whether or not the removed
   DODAG parent is the preferred DODAG parent, the node may transmit a
   DRQ message to discover additional parents. The node may also
   schedule a No-Path DAO message transmission if the removed DODAG
   parent is its DAO parent. 

   To transmit a DRQ message in Storing mode, the node generates a DRQ
   message. It sets RPLInstanceID, DODAGVersionNumber and DODAGID by
   using the maintained DODAG parameters. It sets Rank_N and Rank_D to
   the numerator and denominator of its fractional rank, respectively.
   The node increases its DRSN by 1 and sets HC = 0, MH to an

   appropriate value, and F = 0. There is no Path option field in
   Storing mode.

6.1.1.  DRQ Message Processing

   When a router receives a DRQ message, it discards the DRQ message if
   its DODAG parent set is empty. Otherwise, the router performs the
   following filtering process and discards the DRQ message if any of
   following conditions is true: 

      i) RPLInstanceID or DODAGVersionNumber or DODAGID in the DRQ
      message is not equal to the respective value maintained by the
      router.
      ii) The DRQ message was received already by comparing DRQID and
      DRSN.
      iii) HC is equal to MH.
      iv) The DRQ message is transmitted by router's DODAG parent.
      v) The DRQ message is generated by router itself or by its DODAG
      parent.

   If the DRQ message passes filtering process, the receiving router
   processes the DRQ message further.

   If the receiving router is the DODAG root, it accepts the DRQ message
   and generates a DRP message. To generate a DRP message, the DODAG
   root copies RPLInstanceID, DODAGVersionNumber, DRSN, F, and DODAGID
   from the DRQ message. It sets DRPID to DRQID, RankQ_N and RankQ_D to
   the Rank_N and Rank_D in DRQ message, respectively. It sets RankP_N
   and RankP_D to the numerator and denominator of its fractional rank,
   respectively. The direction bit D is set to Down. Since flag F = 0 in
   Storing mode, there is no Path option field in the DRP message. The
   DODAG root forwards the DRP message to the node from which it
   received the DRQ message. 

   If the receiving router is not the DODAG root and its rank is lower
   than Rank_DRQ, the router accepts the DRQ message and generates a DRP
   message as the root does. The router forwards the DRP message to the
   node from which it received the DRQ message.

   If the receiving router is not the DODAG root and its rank is greater
   than or equal to Rank_DRQ, it adds a route entry to node DRQID into
   its downward routing table, increases value of HC field by 1 and
   forwards the DRQ message to its preferred DODAG parent.

6.1.2.  DRP Message Processing

   When a node receives a DRP message, it first performs filtering
   process and discards the DRP message if any of following conditions

   is true: 

      i) RPLInstanceID or DODAGVersionNumber or DODAGID in the DRP
      message is not equal to the respective value maintained by the
      receiving node. 
      ii) The DRP message was received already by comparing DRPID and
      DRSN.
      iii) The receiving node is leaf node and is not the DRQ message
      generator.

   If DRP message passes filtering process, the receiving node processes
   the DRP message further.

   If the receiving node is the DRQ message generator and the DRP
   message sender is not in its DODAG parent set, it may add the DRP
   message sender into its DODAG parent set and select a new preferred
   DODAG parent. The receiving node may schedule a DAO message
   transmission if the DRP message sender is added into its DAO parent
   set.

   If the receiving node is not the DRQ message generator, it must be a
   router.

   If the receiving router has no route entry to node DRPID in its
   downward routing table, it discards the DRP message. 

   If the receiving router has a downward route entry to node DRPID and
   its rank is greater than or equal to Rank_DRQ (= RankQ_N/RankQ_D), it
   decreases its rank to sp(Rank_DRQ, Rank_DRP), where Rank_DRP =
   RankP_N/RankP_D. The receiving router updates its DODAG parent set
   caused by its rank decrease, that is, removing DODAG parents whose
   ranks are greater than or equal to sp(Rank_DRQ, Rank_DRP). If its
   preferred DODAG parent is removed, it selects a new preferred DODAG
   parent. The receiving router then updates the RankP_N and RankP_D
   fields of the DRP message to the numerator and denominator of its
   fractional rank, respectively, and forwards the DRP message to next
   hop node on the downward route. It may schedule a No-Path DAO message
   transmission if any of its DAO parents is removed due to its rank
   decrease.

   If the receiving router has a downward route entry to node DRPID and
   its rank is lower than Rank_DRQ, it updates the RankP_N and RankP_D
   fields of DRP message to the numerator and denominator of its
   fractional rank, respectively, and forwards the DRP message to next
   hop node on the downward route. In Storing mode, the rank of
   receiving router is less than Rank_DRQ if the receiving router is on
   multiple DODAG repair downward routes. When the receiving router
   receives a DRP message, it may decrease its rank. Therefore,

   subsequent DRP messages may carry a Rank_DRQ greater than or equal to
   the rank of receiving router. If the receiving router is only on a
   single DODAG repair downward route, its rank must be greater than or
   equal to Rank_DRQ based on the DRQ message process procedure.

6.2.  DODAG Local Repair in Non-Storing Mode

   The handling of parent unreachability in Non-Storing mode is similar
   to that in Storing mode. The first difference is that after removing
   a DAO parent from its DAO parent set, if its DODAG parent set is not
   empty, a node may schedule a DAO message transmission instead of the
   No-Path DAO message transmission. The second difference is that to
   generate a DRQ message in Non-Storing mode, if its DODAG parent set
   is empty, a node sets flag F to 1 and adds a Path option field by
   inserting its IPv6 address into the Path option field. If its DODAG
   parent set is not empty, the node may or may not set flag F = 1. The
   third difference is that the DRP message is first forwarded up to the
   DODAG root, which then sends the DRP message down to destination node
   DRPID via source routing.

6.2.1.  DRQ Message Processing

   When a router receives a DRQ message, it performs same filtering
   process as that in Storing mode. If the DRQ message passes filtering
   process, the receiving router processes the DRQ message further.

   If the receiving router is the DODAG root, it accepts the DRQ message
   and generates a DRP message similarly as in Storing mode. The
   direction bit D is set to Down. If flag F = 1 in the DRQ message, the
   DODAG root sets F = 1 in DRP message and copies Path option field
   from DRQ message to Path option field of DRP message. If flag F = 0,
   the DODAG root transmits the DRP message to destination node DRPID by
   using source routing mechanism specified in RPL. If flag F = 1, the
   DODAG root transmits the DRP message to destination node DRPID by
   using the route provided in Path option field, and on the downward
   route, intermediate routers obtain route information from the Path
   option field of DRP message.

   If the receiving router is not the DODAG root and its rank is lower
   than Rank_DRQ, it accepts the DRQ message and generates a DRP message
   similarly as the DODAG root does. The direction bit D is set to Up in
   this case. If flag F = 1 in DRQ message, it sets flag F = 1 in the
   DRP message, copies the Path option field from DRQ message to the
   Path option field of DRP message and then insets its own IPv6 address
   into the Path option field of DRP message. The receiving router
   forwards the DRP message to its preferred DODAG parent.

   If the receiving router is not the DODAG root and its rank is greater
 


Guo, et al.             Expires January 2, 2013                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft               Loop Free RPL                  July 1, 2012


   than or equal to Rank_DRQ, it checks if flag F = 1 in DRQ message. If
   yes, it updates the DRQ message by inserting its own IPv6 address
   into the Path option field, increasing the value of HC field by 1 and
   forwards the DRQ message to its preferred DODAG parent. If no, the
   receiving router increases the value of HC field by 1 and forwards
   the DRQ message to its preferred DODAG parent.

6.2.2.  DRP Message Processing

   When a node receives a DRP message, it performs the same filtering
   process as in Storing mode. In addition, if the direction bit D = Up
   and its DODAG parent set is empty, the receiving node discards the
   DRP message.

   If the DRP message passes filtering process, the receiving node
   processes the DRP message further.

6.2.2.1.  Direction Bit D = Up

   In this case, the receiving node must be a router. 

   If the receiving router is the DODAG root, it updates RankP_N and
   RankP_D to the numerator and denominator of its fractional rank,
   respectively, and changes direction bit D to Down. If flag F = 0, the
   DODAG root transmits the DRP message down to destination node DRPID
   by using source routing mechanism specified in RPL. If flag F = 1,
   the DODAG root transmits the DRP message down to destination node
   DRPID by using the route provided in the Path option field of DRP
   message.

   If the receiving router is not the DODAG root and flag F = 1, the
   receiving router updates the DRP message by inserting its own IPv6
   address into the Path option field of DRP message and forwards the
   DRP message to its preferred DODAG parent. If flag F = 0, the
   receiving router forwards the DRP message to its preferred DODAG
   parent.

6.2.2.2.  Direction Bit D = Down

   In this case, the receiving node can be a leaf node or a router.

   If the receiving node is the DRQ message generator and the DRP
   message sender is not in its DODAG parent set, it may add the DRP
   message sender into its DODAG parent set. The receiving node may
   select a new preferred DODAG parent. It may also schedule a DAO
   message transmission if the DRP message sender is added into its DAO
   parent set.

   If the receiving node is not DRQ message generator, it must be a
   router.

   If the receiving router is not on the downward route, it discards the
   DRP message. Otherwise, if its rank is lower than Rank_DRQ, the
   receiving router updates the RankP_N and RankP_D fields of the DRP
   message to the numerator and denominator of its fractional rank,
   respectively, and forwards the DRP message to destination node DRPID
   by obtaining route information provided in RPL source routing
   mechanism (if F = 0) or in the Path option field (if F = 1). If its
   rank is greater than or equal to Rank_DRQ, the receiving router
   decreases its rank to sp(Rank_DRQ, Rank_DRP) and updates its DODAG
   parent set by removing any DODAG parent whose rank is greater than or
   equal to sp(Rank_DRQ, Rank_DRP). If its preferred DODAG parent is
   removed, it selects a new preferred DODAG parent. The receiving
   router updates the RankP_N and RankP_D fields of DRP message to the
   numerator and denominator of its fractional rank, respectively, and
   forwards the DRP message to the destination node DRPID by obtaining
   route information provided in RPL source routing mechanism (if F = 0)
   or in the Path option field (if F = 1). Furthermore, the receiving
   router may schedule a DAO message transmission if any of its DAO
   parents was removed due to its rank decrease. 

7.  Security Considerations

   This draft introduces an alternative rank computation method and a
   DODAG local repair mechanism. In general, the security considerations
   for the DODAG construction and maintenance are similar to the ones
   for the operation of RPL as described in Section 19 of [RFC6550].
   Section 10 of RPL specification [RFC6550] describes a variety of
   security mechanisms that provide data confidentiality,
   authentication, replay protection and delay protection services. Each
   RPL control message has a secure version that allows the
   specification of the level of security and the algorithms used to
   secure the message. New RPL control messages (DRQ and DRP) defined in
   this draft have secure versions as well.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This draft defines two new RPL Control Messages types and a new RPL
   Control Message Option.

   Code field for the DODAG Repair Request (DRQ) message needs to be
   assigned by IANA.

   Code field for the DODAG Repair Reply (DRP) message needs to be
   assigned by IANA.
