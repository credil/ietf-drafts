    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This draft proposes a Authorization Data container for Kerberos
      that identifies a base set of MAC and other elements necessary to
      authenticate the authorization data being carried in such a way that
      not only the KDC but also services can independently verify that
      the data has been authenticated by the KDC and has not been tampered
      with.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements Language">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Validation">
      <t> Authorization data is highly sensitive and must be validated to
      insure no tampering has occured.</t>
      
      <t> In order to validate any information the receiving client need to be
      able to cryptographically verify the data. This is done by introducing a
      new AuthorizationData element called AD-CAMMAC that contains enough
      information to bind the contents to a principal in a way that a receiving
      client can verify autonomusly without further contact with the KDC.</t>
      
      <t>The following information is needed:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>The KDC signature.</t>

          <t>The Service Signature.</t>

          <t>Optional Trusted Service Key Signature.</t>

          <t>Optional PUBKEY KDC Signature.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>The KDC signature is required to allow the KDC to validate the data
      withouth requiring to recompute the contents at every TGS request.</t>

      <t>The SVC signature is required so that the Service can verify that
      the authorization data has been validated by the KDC.</t>

      <t>Both the Trusted Service Checksum and the asymmetric KDC Signature
      are useful to verify the authenticity of the contents on the same host,
      when the data is received by a less trusted service and passed to a more
      trusted service on the same host without the need for additional
      roundtrips to the KDC.</t>

      <t>The ad-type for AD-CAMMAC is (TBD).</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Encoding">
      <t>The Kerberos protocol is defined in [RFC4120] using Abstract Syntax
      Notation One (ASN.1) [X680]. As such, this specification also uses the
      ASN.1 syntax for specifying both the abstract layout of the AD-CAMMAC
      attributes, as well as its encoding.</t>

   kdc-signature
      A cryptographic checksum computed over the encoding of the
      elements field, keyed with the krbtgt key.
      Checksum type TBD.

   svc-signature
      A cryptographic checksum computed over the encoding of the
      elements field, keyed with the service long term key.
      Checksum type TBD.

   trusted-svc-signature
      A principal name and a cryptographic checksum computed over the
      encoding of the elements field, keyed with the long term key of
      the principal name specified in the Name field. Unless otherwise
      explicitly administratively configured, the key SHOULD be found
      by substituting the service name component of the principal name
      of the service with 'host'.
      If the service is 'host' this checksum is redundant and can be
      omitted.
      If the resulting host/<name>@REALM or the administratively
      configured service is not found in the KDC database this
      cheksum can be omitted.
      Checksum type TBD.

   pubkey-signature
      A name identifying the asymmetric key-pair used.
      A checksum computed over the encoding of the elements field using
      the Private Key identified in the Name field.
      If an asymmetric key is not available this checksum MUST be
      omitted.
      Signature type TBD.

   elements
      A sequence of authorization data elements issued by the KDC.
