Abstract

   BCP 10 (RFC 3777) specifies IETF processes for selection,
   confirmation and recall of appointees to IETF positions.  It also
   refers to the mechanism of resignation as part of a sequence that
   moves a sitting member to a new IETF position.  However it does not
   more generally deal with vacancies created by resignation, death or
   uncontested, sustained absence from participation.  This update to
   BCP 10 specifies procedures for handling vacancies.

Internet-Draft        RFC 3777 Update for Vacancies         October 2012


1.  Introduction

   [RFC3777] (BCP 10) specifies IETF processes for selection,
   confirmation and recall of appointees to IETF positions.  It also
   refers to the mechanism of resignation as part of a sequence that
   moves a sitting member to a new IETF position.  However it does not
   more generally deal with vacancies created by resignation, death or
   uncontested, sustained absence from participation.  This update to
   RFC 3777 specifies procedures for handling vacancies.

1.1.  Draft changes

   NOTE TO RFC EDITOR:  Remove this section prior to publication.

   o  "For vacancies due to death or resignation..." - slight wording
      tweak.

   o  "Extended Last Call" - changed to cite RFC 2026 and match its use
      of the label.

   o  "For a contested, sustained absence,..." - reworded


2.  Changes to RFC 3777 (BCP 10)

   BCP 10 is modified as follows:

   o  A new section is added, containing the text of the Mid-Term
      Vacancy (Section 3) section, below.


3.  Mid-Term Vacancy

   The process of filling a mid-term vacancy is specified in Section 5
   of [RFC3777](BCP10).

3.1.  Definition

   A mid-term vacancy occurs in the IAB, IESG or IAOC when a sitting
   member of that body ceases to participate in its activities.  Vacancy
   can occur due to death, resignation, or sustained absence.

3.2.  Determination

   The IETF body of which the sitting member is a part will determine
   that the sitting member has vacated their position.  In the case of
   vacancy due to uncontested, sustained absence, the body will make
   multiple different queries to the member, to determine the cause and

   likely duration of the absence.  If the member who is at issue
   contests the determination that they have vacated the position, the
   existing Member Recall process, as specified in Section 7 of
   [RFC3777], is required.

   A two-thirds majority vote of the IETF body is needed to determine
   that a vacancy exists.

3.3.  Confirmation

   For vacancies due to death or resignation, no further action is
   required before declaring the seat vacant.

   For vacancies due to uncontested, sustained absence, the IETF body
   making that determination will issue an extended Last-Call Section
   9.1, RFC 2026 [RFC2026] to the community.  The Last Call will explain
   the basis for declaring the position vacant and include a summary of
   efforts to contact the member to resolve the issue.

   The results of the Last Call are assessed by the IETF body, with a
   two-thirds vote of the body.


4.  Security Considerations

   This document carries no security concerns.
