Abstract 

   This document describes a source address validation solution for WLAN 
   enabling 802.11i or other security mechanisms. This mechanism snoops 
   NDP and DHCP to bind IP address with MAC address, and relies on the 
   security of MAC address guaranteed by 802.11i or other mechanisms to 
   filter IP spoofing packets. It can work in the special situations 
   described in the charter of SAVI workgroup, such as multiple MAC 
   addresses on one interface. This document describes three different 
   deployment scenarios, with solutions for migration of mapping entries 
   when hosts move from one access point to another.

1. Introduction 

   This document describes a mechanism to perform per packet IP source 
   address validation in WLAN. This mechanism performs ND snooping or 
   DHCP snooping to bind allocated IP address with authenticated MAC 
   address. Static addresses are bound to the MAC addresses of 
   corresponding stations manually. Then the mechanism can check 
   validity of source IP address in local packets according to the 
   binding association. The security of MAC address is assured by 
   802.11i or other mechanisms, thus the binding association is secure.  

   The situation that one interfaces with multiple MAC addresses is a 
   special case mentioned in the charter of SAVI. And this situation is 
   the only special case that challenges MAC-IP binding. The mechanism 
   to handle this situation is specified in the document. 

   There are three deployment scenarios specified in this document. The 
   mechanism is deployed on different devices in different scenarios. 
   The deployment detail is described in the document. 

   When hosts move from one access point to another, the migration of 
   mapping entries may be triggered according to the specific mobility 
   scenario. The mechanism to handle host mobility is specified in the 
   document according to different deployment scenarios.  

2. Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].  

3. IP-MAC Binding 

   This section specifies the operations of binding IP addresses to MAC 
   addresses, and the clear of binding.

3.1. Data Structures 

3.1.1. IP-MAC Mapping Table 

   This table maps IP addresses to corresponding MAC addresses. IP 
   address is the index of the table. One IP address can only have one 
   corresponding MAC address, while different IP addresses can be mapped 
   to the same MAC address.  

   This table is used in control process. Before creating new IP-MAC 
   bindings, this table must first be consulted in case of conflict in 
   binding entries. This table must be synchronized with the MAC-IP 
   table specified in Section 3.1.2. 

   Each entry in IP-MAC mapping table must also record the binding state 
   of the IP address. Addresses snooped in DHCP address assignment 
   procedure must record its state as "DHCPv6" and addresses snooped in 
   Duplicate Address Detection procedure must record its state as 
   "SLAAC". 

   Each entry in IP-MAC mapping table has its lifetime. The address 
   allocated by DHCP has a limited lifetime, so the related entry 
   records its lifetime the same as that of the address. According to 
   [RFC4862], stateless address also has a limited lifetime, and the 
   stations set this lifetime by itself. Thus the related entry also 
   records its lifetime the same as that of the address. 

3.1.2. MAC-IP Mapping Table 

   This table maps MAC addresses to corresponding IP addresses. MAC 
   address is the index of the table. It is a one-to-many mapping table, 
   which means a MAC address can be mapped to multiple IP addresses. 
   Though multiple MAC addresses may exist on one interface, these MAC 
   addresses must be mapped to different IP addresses. 

   This table is used for filtering. IP-MAC mapping table and MAC-IP 
   mapping table can be maintained separately on different devices, but 
   they must be synchronized. We will specify the details in Section 4. 

3.2. Pre-conditions for binding 

   In the binding based mechanism, the security of IP address is based 
   on the security of the binding anchor. In WLAN, a number of security 
   mechanisms on link layer make MAC address a strong enough binding 
   anchor, for instance, 802.11i, WAPI, WEP.

   If MAC address has no protection, attackers can spoof MAC address to 
   succeed in validation. However, in general cases, if MAC address is 
   not protected, more serious attack can be launched than IP spoofing 
   attack.  

3.3. Binding IP addresses to MAC addresses 

   All the static IP-MAC address pairs are configured into the IP-MAC 
   Mapping Table with the mechanism enabled.  

   An individual procedure handles binding DHCP addresses to MAC 
   addresses. This procedure snoops the DHCP address assignment 
   procedure between attached hosts and DHCP server. DHCP snooping in 
   WLAN is the same as that in wired network. 

   An individual procedure handles binding stateless addresses to MAC 
   addresses. This procedure snoops Duplicate Address Detection 
   procedure. ND snooping in WLAN is the same as that in wired network. 

   Different from wired network, the function of address snooping and 
   IP-MAC table maintaining may also be separated onto different
   devices. Thus to prevent conflictions in binding entries, the device  
   snoops addresses must have interactions with the device holds the  
   IP-MAC table. We will specify the details in Section 5.1.1.  

3.4. Binding Migration 

   Different from wired network, SAVI for WLAN must handle migration of 
   binding entries when mobile hosts move from one access point to 
   another. After movement, hosts will not perform another address 
   allocation procedure to obtain new IP addresses, but continue to use 
   the existing IP address. Thus binding entries in the foreign device 
   that the mobile hosts access to cannot be established by snooping. A 
   new mechanism is needed to correctly migrate the binding entry 
   related to the IP address of the mobile host from the home device to 
   the foreign device. We will specify the details in Section 5, 
   according to deferent deployment scenarios. 

3.5. Binding Clearing 

   Three kinds of events will trigger binding clearing:  

   1. The lifetime of an IP address in one entry has expired.  This IP 
   entry MUST be cleared.  

   2. A station leaves this access point. The entries for all the 
   related MAC addresses MUST be deleted.

   3. A DHCP RELEASE message is received from the owner of corresponding 
   IP address. This IP entry MUST be deleted. 

4. Source Address Validation 

   This section describes on source address validation procedure on 
   packet. In this procedure, all the frames are assumed to have passed 
   the verifications of 802.11i or other security mechanisms.   

   This procedure has the following steps:  

   1. Extract the IP source and MAC source from the frame. Lookup the 
   MAC address in the MAC-IP Mapping Table and check if the MAC-IP pair 
   exists. If yes, forward the packet. Or else go to next step.  

   2. Lookup the IP address in the IP-MAC Mapping Table and check if the 
   IP address exists. If no, insert a new entry into the IP-MAC Mapping 
   Table and forward the packet. If yes, check whether The MAC address 
   in the entry is the same as that in the frame. If yes, forward the 
   packet. Else drop the packet.  

5. Deployment Scenarios 

   This section specifies three deployment scenarios including two under 
   centralized WLAN and one under autonomous WLAN. The deployment 
   details and solutions for host mobility between access points are 
   described respectively in each scenario. 

5.1. Centralized WLAN 

   Centralized WLAN is comprised of FIT Access Points (AP) and Access 
   Controllers (AC). In this scenario, this document proposes the 
   following two deployment solutions. 

5.1.1. AP Filtering 

   In this scenario, AC maintains IP-MAC Mapping Table while AP 
   maintains MAC-IP Mapping Table and perform address snooping. Packet 
   filtering will be performed also on AP as specified in Section 4. 

5.1.1.1. Candidate Binding 

   AP executes the procedure specified in Section 3.3. Candidate binding 
   is generated after snooping procedure. Candidate binding must be 
   confirmed by AC to be valid.

Internet-Draft                SAVI wlan                     April 2012 
    

   After a candidate binding is generated, AC is notified and checks 
   whether the binding is valid or not. The validity of a candidate 
   binding is determined if the binding does not violate any existing 
   bindings in the IP-MAC Mapping Table. Otherwise if an address is not 
   suitable for a host to use, AC notifies the corresponding AP. If the 
   candidate binding is valid, AC adds an entry into the IP-MAC Mapping 
   Table and notifies AP. Afterwards AP also adds an entry into the 
   local MAC-IP Mapping Table. 

5.1.1.2. CAPWAP Extension 

   CAPWAP protocol is used for communication between AP and AC. A new 
   CAPWAP protocol message element is introduced, which extends the 
   [CAPWAP]. The host IP message element is used by both AP and AC to 
   exchange the binding information of hosts. 

   The host IP message element can be used in the process of 
   confirmation of candidate binding. When AP generates a candidate 
   binding, it reports the MAC address and related IP addresses to AC 
   using this message, with suggestions of the state and lifetime of 
   each IP address as specified in Section 3.1.1. After AC checks the 
   validation of the candidate binding, it replies using a message of 
   the same format to inform AP the validation of each IP address with 
   suggestions of its state and lifetime. 

   The host IP message element also can be used in the process of 
   binding migration. In mobility scenario, foreign device the mobile 
   hosts accesses to need to request related bindings from home devices, 
   and host IP message element can be used for interactions between  
   them. Details will be specified in the following sections according  
   to different deployment scenarios.

   value of address state (also one value for now), and a 32-bit value 
   lifetime. 

5.1.1.3. Mobility Solution 

   When a host moves from one AP to another, layer-2 association happens 
   before IP packet transfer. Home AP deletes the binding when mobile 
   host is disconnected, and foreign AP immediately requests the bound 
   addresses with the associated MAC from AC using host IP message 
   element specified in Section 5.1.1.2. AC return the binding with 
   suggestions of its state and lifetime also using the new CAPWAP 
   protocol message. After AP get the addresses should be bound, the 
   binding migration is completed.  

   In WLAN, a host can move from an AC to another AC while keeping using 
   the same IP address. To be compatible with such scenario, ACs must 
   communicate to perform the binding migration.  

   CAPWAP extensions specified in Section 5.1.1.2 can also be used for 
   communications between AC. The procedure of binding migration is the 
   similar to that in the previous scenario. Home AC deletes the binding 
   when mobile host is disconnected, and foreign AC requests the bound 
   addresses with the associated MAC from Home AC. 

5.1.2. AC Filtering 

   In this scenario, AC maintains both MAC-IP and IP-MAC Mapping Table 
   and performs both address snooping and packet filtering. So all the 
   packets must be firstly be forwarded to AC. AC executes the procedure 
   specified in Section 3.3 and check the validity of IP-MAC pairs by 
   consulting the local IP-MAC mapping table. No extra procedures are 
   needed to establish the IP-MAC bindings. AC executes the procedure 
   specified in Section 4 for packet filtering. 

   Mobility within one AC does not trigger any binding migration. 
   Mobility between different ACs triggers binding migration. Home AC 
   deletes the binding when mobile host is disconnected, and foreign AC 
   requests the bound addresses with the associated MAC from Home AC. 
   CAPWAP extensions specified in Section 5.1.1.2 can be used for 
   communications between AC. 

5.2. Autonomous WLAN 

   Autonomous WLAN is comprised of FAT Access Points. In this scenario, 
   FAT AP maintains both MAC-IP and IP-MAC Mapping Table and performs 
   both address snooping and packet filtering. FAT AP executes the 
   procedure specified in Section 3.3 and check the validity of IP-MAC

   pairs by consulting the local IP-MAC mapping table. No extra 
   procedures are needed to establish the IP-MAC bindings. FAT AP 
   executes the procedure specified in Section 4 for packet filtering. 

   Mobility between different FAT APs will trigger binding migration. 
   Home FAT AP deletes the binding when mobile host is disconnected, and 
   foreign FAT AP requests the bound addresses with the associated MAC 
   from Home FAT AP. CAPWAP extensions specified in Section 5.1.1.2 can 
   be used for communications between FAT AP. 

6. Security Considerations 

   The security of address allocation methods matters the security of 
   this mechanism. Thus it is necessary to improve the security of 
   stateless auto-configuration and DHCP firstly.  

7. IANA Considerations 

   There is no IANA Consideration currently.  

8. Conclusions 

   This solution can satisfy the requirements of SAVI charter in WLAN 
   enabling 802.11i or other security mechanisms.
