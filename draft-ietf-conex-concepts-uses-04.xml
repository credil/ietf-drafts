      <t>This document provides the entry point to the set of documentation
      about the Congestion Exposure (ConEx) protocol. It explains the
      motivation for including a ConEx marking at the IP layer: to expose
      information about congestion to network nodes. Although such information
      may have a number of uses, this document focuses on how the information
      communicated by the ConEx marking can serve as the basis for significantly
      more efficient and effective traffic management than what exists on the
      Internet today.</t>

    <section anchor="conex-uses-intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>The power of Internet technology comes from multiplexing shared
      capacity with packets rather than circuits. Network operators aim to
      provide sufficient shared capacity, but when too much packet load meets
      too little shared capacity, congestion results. Congestion appears as
      either increased delay, dropped packets or packets explicitly marked
      with Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) markings <xref
      target="RFC3168"></xref>. As described in <xref
      target="conex-uses_Fig_ConEx_Placement"></xref>, congestion control
      currently relies on the transport receiver detecting these 'Congestion
      Signals' and informing the transport sender in 'Congestion Feedback
      Signals.' The sender is then expected to reduce its rate in
      response.</t>

      <t>This document provides the entry point to the set of documentation
      about the Congestion Exposure (ConEx) protocol. It focuses on the
      motivation for including a ConEx marking at the IP layer. (A companion
      document, <xref target="I-D.ietf-conex-abstract-mech"></xref>, focuses on the
      mechanics of the protocol.) Briefly, the idea is for the sender to
      continually signal expected congestion in the headers of any data it
      sends. To a first approximation, the sender does this by relaying the
      'Congestion Feedback Signals' back into the IP layer. They then travel
      unchanged across the network to the receiver (shown as
      'IP-Layer-ConEx-Signals' in <xref
      target="conex-uses_Fig_ConEx_Placement"></xref>). This enables IP layer
      devices on the path to see information about the whole path
      congestion.</t>

      <t>One of the key benefits of exposing this congestion information at
      the IP layer is that it makes the information available to network
      operators for use as input into their traffic management procedures. As
      shown in <xref target="conex-uses_Fig_ConEx_Placement"></xref>, a
      ConEx-enabled sender signals whole path congestion, which is
      (approximately) the congestion one round trip time earlier as reported
      by the receiver to the sender. The ConEx signal is a mark in the IP
      header that is easy for any IP device to read. Therefore a node
      performing traffic management can count congestion as easily as it might
      count data volume today by simply counting the volume of packets with
      ConEx markings.</t>

      <t>ConEx-based traffic management can make highly efficient use of
      capacity. In times of no congestion, all traffic management restraints
      can be removed, leaving the network's full capacity available to all its
      users. If some users on the network cause disproportionate congestion,
      the traffic management function can learn about this and directly limit
      those users' traffic in order to protect the service of other users
      sharing the same capacity. ConEx-based traffic management thus presents
      a step change in terms of the options available to network operators for
      managing traffic on their networks.</t>

      <t>The remainder of this document explains the concepts behind ConEx and
      how exposing congestion can significantly improve Internet traffic
      management, among other benefits. <xref target="concepts"></xref>
      introduces a number of concepts that are fundamental to understanding
      how ConEx-based traffic management works. <xref
      target="traffic-management"></xref> shows how ConEx can be used for
      traffic management, discusses additional benefits from such usage, and
      compares ConEx-based traffic management to existing traffic management
      approaches. <xref target="other-use-cases"></xref> discusses other
      related use cases. <xref target="deployments"></xref> briefly discusses
      deployment arrangements. The final sections are standard RFC back
      matter.</t>
    </section>

    <!-- ====================================================================== -->

    <section anchor="concepts" title="Concepts">
      <t>ConEx relies on a precise definition of congestion and a number of
      newer concepts that are introduced and defined in this section.</t>

      <section anchor="congestion" title="Congestion">
        <t>Despite its central role in network control and management,
        congestion is a remarkably difficult concept to define. Experts in
        different disciplines and with different perspectives define
        congestion in a variety of ways <xref target="Bauer09"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The definition used for the purposes of ConEx is expressed as the
        probability of packet loss (or the probability of packet marking if
        ECN is in use). This definition focuses on how congestion is measured,
        rather than describing congestion as a condition or state.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="congestion-volume" title="Congestion-Volume">
        <t>The metric that ConEx exposes is congestion-volume: the volume of
        bytes dropped or ECN-marked in a given period of time. Counting
        congestion-volume allows each user to be held responsible for his or
        her contribution to causing congestion. Congestion-volume is a
        property of traffic, whereas congestion describes a link or a
        path.</t>

        <t>To understand congestion-volume, consider a simple example. Imagine
        Alice sends 1GB while the loss-probability is a constant 0.2%. Her
        contribution to congestion -- her congestion-volume -- is 1GB x 0.2% =
        2MB. If she then sends 3GB while the loss-probability is 0.1%, this
        adds 3MB to her congestion-volume. Her total contribution to
        congestion is then 2MB+3MB = 5MB.</t>

        <t>Fortunately, measuring Alice's congestion-volume on a real network
        does not require the kind of arithmetic shown above because
        congestion-volume can be directly measured by counting the total
        volume of Alice's traffic that gets discarded or ECN-marked. (A queue
        with a percentage loss involves multiplication inherently.)</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="upstream-downstream-congestion"
               title="Rest-of-Path Congestion">
        <t>At a particular measurement point within a network, "rest-of-path
        congestion" (also known as "downstream congestion") is the level
        of congestion that a traffic flow is expected to experience between
        the measurement point and its final destination. "Upstream congestion"
        is the congestion experienced up to the measurement
        point.</t>

        <t>Measurement points that only observe ECN marks are capable of
        measuring upstream congestion, whereas measurement points that observe
        ConEx marks in addition to ECN marks can use both kinds of marks to
        calculate rest-of-path congestion. When ECN signals are monitored in
        the middle of a network, they indicate the congestion
        experienced so far on the path (upstream congestion). In contrast, the
        ConEx signals inserted into IP headers as shown in <xref
        target="conex-uses_Fig_ConEx_Placement"></xref> indicate the
        congestion along a whole path from source to destination. Therefore if
        a measurement point detects both of these signals, it can subtract the
        level of ECN (upstream congestion) from the level of ConEx (whole
        path) to derive a measure of the congestion that packets are likely to
        experience between the monitoring point and their destination
        (rest-of-path congestion).</t>

        <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-conex-abstract-mech"></xref> has further discussion
        of the constraints around the network's ability to measure
        rest-of-path congestion.</t>

            the purposes of ConEx, congestion is measured using the concrete
            signals provided by loss and ECN markings (delay is not
            considered). Congestion is measured as the probability of loss or
            the probability of ECN marking, usually expressed as a

    <section anchor="traffic-management"
             title="Core Use Case: Informing Traffic Management">
      <t>This section explains how ConEx could be used as the basis for
      traffic management, highlights additional benefits derived from having
      ConEx-aware nodes on the network, and compares ConEx-based traffic
      management to existing approaches.</t>

      <section anchor="using-conex" title="Use Case Description">
        <t>One of the key benefits that ConEx can deliver is in helping
        network operators to improve how they manage traffic on their
        networks. Consider the common case of a commercial broadband network
        where a relatively small number of users place disproportionate demand
        on network resources, at times resulting in congestion. The network
        operator seeks a way to manage traffic such that the traffic that
        contributes more to congestion bears more of the brunt of the
        management.</t>

        <t>Assuming ConEx signals are visible at the IP layer, the network operator
        can accomplish this by placing a congestion policer at an enforcement
        point within the network and configuring it with a traffic management
        policy that monitors each user's contribution to congestion. As
        described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-conex-abstract-mech"></xref> and elaborated
        in <xref target="CongPol"></xref>, one way to implement a congestion policer is in a similar way to a bit-rate policer, except that it
        monitors and polices congestion-volume rather than bit-rate. When
        implemented as a token bucket, the tokens provide users with the right
        to cause bits of congestion-volume, rather than to send bits of data
        volume. The fill rate represents each user's congestion-volume
        quota.</t>

        <t>The congestion policer monitors the ConEx signals of the traffic
        entering the network. As long as the network remains uncongested and
        users stay within their quotas, no action is taken. When the network
        becomes congested and a user exhausts his quota, some action is taken
        against the traffic that breached the quota in accordance with the
        network operator's traffic management policy. For example, the traffic may be
        dropped, delayed, or marked with a lower QoS class. In this way,
        traffic is managed according to its contribution to congestion -- not
        some application- or flow-specific policy -- and is not managed at all
        during times of no congestion.</t>

        <t>As an example of how a network operator might employ a ConEx-based
        traffic management system, consider a typical DSL network architecture
        (as elaborated in <xref target="TR-059"></xref> and <xref
        target="TR-101"></xref>). Traffic is routed from regional and global
        IP networks to an operator-controlled IP node, the Broadband Remote
        Access Server (BRAS). From the BRAS, traffic is delivered to access
        nodes. The BRAS carries enhanced functionality including IP QoS and
        traffic management capabilities.</t>

        <t>Based on typical network designs and current traffic patterns, the
        BRAS is located at a point in the network where congestion may be most
        likely to occur. As a consequence, the BRAS is a logical choice of
        location for deploying traffic management functionality. By deploying
        a congestion policer at the BRAS location, the network operator can measure
        the congestion-volume created by users within the access nodes and police misbehaving users before their traffic affects others on the access network. The
        policer would be provisioned with a traffic management policy, perhaps
        directing the BRAS to drop packets from users that exceed their
        congestion-volume quotas during times of congestion. Those users would
        be likely to react in the typical way to drops, backing off
        (assuming use of standard TCP), and thereby lowering their
        congestion-volumes back within the quota limits.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="additional-benefits" title="Additional Benefits">
        <t>The ConEx-based approach to traffic management has a number of
        benefits in addition to efficient management of traffic. It provides
        incentives for users to make use of scavenger transport protocols,
        such as <xref target="I-D.ietf-ledbat-congestion"></xref>, that provide ways for
        bulk-transfer applications to rapidly yield when interactive
        applications require capacity. With a congestion policer in place as
        described in <xref target="using-conex"></xref>, users of these
        protocols will be less likely to run afoul of the network operator's traffic
        management policy than those whose bulk-transfer applications generate
        the same volume of traffic without being sensitive to congestion.</t>

        <t>ConEx-based traffic management also makes it possible for a user to
        control the relative performance among its own traffic flows. If a
        user wants some flows to have more bandwidth than others, it can allow
        the higher bandwidth traffic to generate more congestion signals,
        leaving less congestion "budget" for the user to "spend" on other
        traffic. This approach is most relevant if congestion is signalled by
        ECN, because no impairment due to loss is involved and delay can
        remain low.</t>

        <t>A variety of approaches already exist for network operators to
        manage congestion, traffic, and the disproportionate usage of scarce
        capacity by a small number of users. Common approaches can be
        categorized as rate-based, volume-based, or application-based.</t>

        <t>Rate-based approaches constrain the traffic rate per user or per
        network. A user's peak and average (or "committed") rate may be
        limited. These approaches have the potential to either over- or
        under-constrain the network, suppressing rates even when the network
        is uncongested or not suppressing them enough during heavy usage
        periods.</t>

        <t>Round-robin scheduling and fair queuing were developed to address
        these problems. They equalize relative rates between active users (or
        flows) at a known bottleneck. The bit-rate allocated to any one user
        depends on the number of active users at each instant. The drawback of these approaches is that they favor heavy users over light users over time, because they do not have any memory of usage. Heavy users will be active at every instant
        whereas light users will only occupy their share of the link
        occassionally, but bit-rate is shared instant by instant.</t>

        <t>Volume-based approaches measure the overall volume of traffic a
        user sends (and/or receives) over time. Users may be subject to an
        absolute volume cap (for example, 10GB per month) or the "heaviest"
        users may be sanctioned in some other manner. Many providers use
        monthly volume limits and count volume regardless of whether the
        network is congested or not, creating the potential for over- or
        under-constraining problems, as with the original rate-based
        approaches.</t>

        <t>ConEx-based approaches, by comparison, only react during times of
        congestion and in proportion to each user's congestion contribution,
        making more efficient use of capacity and more proportionate
        management decisions.</t>

        <t>Unlike ConEx-based approaches, neither rate-based nor volume-based
        approaches provide incentives for applications to use scavenger
        transports. They may even penalize users of applications that employ
        scavenger services for the large amount of volume they send, rather
        than rewarding them for carefully avoiding congestion while sending
        it. While the volume-based approach described in Comcast's
        Protocol-Agnostic Congestion Management System <xref
        target="RFC6057"></xref> aims to overcome the over/under-constraining
        problem by only measuring volume and triggering traffic management
        action during periods of high utilization, it still does not provide
        incentives to use scavenger transports because congestion-causing
        volume cannot be distinguished from volume overall. ConEx provides
        this ability.</t>

        <t>Application-based approaches use deep packet inspection or other
        techniques to determine what application a given traffic flow is
        associated with. Network operators may then use this information to rate-limit
        or otherwise sanction certain applications, in some cases only during
        peak hours. These approaches suffer from being at odds with IPSec and
        some application-layer encryption, and they may raise additional
        policy concerns. In contrast, ConEx offers an application-agnostic
        metric to serve as the basis for traffic management decisions.</t>

        <t>The existing types of approaches share a further limitation that
        ConEx can help to overcome: performance uncertainty. Flat-rate pricing
        plans are popular because users appreciate the certainty of having
        their monthly bill amount remain the same for each billing period,
        allowing them to plan their costs accordingly. But while flat-rate
        pricing avoids billing uncertainty, it creates performance
        uncertainty: users cannot know whether the performance of their
        connections is being altered or degraded based on how the network
        operator is attempting to manage congestion. By exposing congestion
        information at the IP layer, ConEx instead provides a metric that can
        serve as an open, transparent basis for traffic management policies
        that both providers and their customers can measure and verify. It can be used to reduce the performance uncertainty that some users currently experience.</t>

    <section anchor="other-use-cases" title="Other Use Cases">
      <t>ConEx information can be put to a number of uses other than informing
      traffic management. These include:</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Informing inter-operator contracts:">ConEx information
          is made visible to every IP node, including border nodes between
          networks. Network operators can use this information to measure how
          much traffic from each network contributes to congestion in the
          other. As such, congestion-volume could be included as a metric in
          inter-operator contracts, just as volume or bit-rate are included
          today.</t>

          <t hangText="Enabling more efficient capacity provisioning:"><xref target="additional-benefits" /> explained
		   how operators can use ConEx-based traffic management to encourage
		   use of scavenger transports, which significantly improves the
		   performance of interactive applications while still allowing heavy users to transfer high volumes.  Here we explain how this
		   can also benefit network operators.</t>

		   <t hangText="">Today, when loss, delay or averaged utilization exceeds a certain
		   threshold, some operators just buy more capacity without
		   attempting to manage the traffic.  Other operators prefer to limit
		   a minority of heavy users at peak times, but they still
		   eventually buy more capacity when utilization rises.</t>

		   <t hangText="">With ConEx-based traffic management, a network operator should be able to provision capacity more efficiently. An operator could benefit from this in a variety of ways. For example, the operator could add capacity as it would do without ConEx, but deliver better quality of service for its users. Or the operator could delay adding capacity while delivering similar quality of service to what it currently provides.</t>

    <section anchor="deployments" title="Deployment Arrangements">
      <t>ConEx is designed so that it can be incrementally deployed in the
      Internet and still be valuable for early adopters. As long as some
      senders are ConEx-enabled, a network on the path can unilaterally use
      ConEx-aware policy devices for traffic management; no changes to network
      forwarding elements are needed and ConEx still works if there are other
      networks on the path that are unaware of ConEx marks.</t>

      <t>The above two steps seem to represent a stand-off where neither step
      is useful until the other has made the first move: i) some sending hosts
      must be modifed to give information to the network and ii) a network
      must deploy policy devices to monitor this information and act on it.
      Nonetheless, the developer of a scavenger transport protocol like LEDBAT
      does stand to benefit from deploying ConEx. In this case the
      developer makes the first move, expecting it will prompt at least some
      networks to move in response, using the ConEx
      information to reward users of the scavenger protocol.</t>

      <t>On the host side, we have already shown (Figure <xref
      target="conex-uses_Fig_ConEx_Placement"></xref>) how the sender
      piggy-backs ConEx signals on normal data packets to re-insert feedback
      about packet drops (and/or ECN) back into the IP layer. In the case of
      TCP, <xref target="I-D.kuehlewind-conex-tcp-modifications"></xref> proposes the required
      sender modifications. ConEx works with any TCP receiver as long as it
      uses SACK, which most do. There is a receiver optimisation <xref
      target="I-D.kuehlewind-conex-accurate-ecn"></xref> that improves ConEx precision
      when using ECN, but ConEx can still use ECN without it.</t>

      <t>On the network side the provider solely needs to place ConEx
      congestion policers at each ingress to its network, in a similar
      arrangement to the edge-policed architecture of Diffserv <xref
      target="RFC2475"></xref>.</t>

      <t>A sender can choose whether to send ConEx or Not-ConEx packets. ConEx
      packets bring information to the policer about congestion expected on
      the rest of the path beyond the policer. Not-ConEx packets bring no such
      information. Therefore the network will tend to rate-limit not-ConEx
      packets conservatively in order to manage the unknown risk of
      congestion. In contrast, a network doesn't normally need to rate-limit
      ConEx-enabled packets unless they reveal a persistently high
      contribution to congestion. This natural tendency for networks to favour
      senders that provide ConEx information reinforces ConEx deployment.</t>

      <t>The above gives only the most salient aspects of ConEx deployment.
      For further detail, <xref target="I-D.ietf-conex-abstract-mech"></xref> describes
      the incremental deployment features of the ConEx protocol and the
      components that need to be deployed for ConEx to work. Then <xref
      target="I-D.briscoe-conex-initial-deploy"></xref> gives concrete examples of
      feasible initial deployment scenarios.</t>
