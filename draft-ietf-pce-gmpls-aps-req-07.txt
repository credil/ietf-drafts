Internet-Draft         Reqs for GMPLS apps of PCE             March 2013


1.  Introduction

   The initial effort of the PCE WG is focused on solving the path
   computation problem within a domain or over different domains in MPLS
   networks.  As the same case with MPLS, service providers (SPs) have
   also come up with requirements for path computation in GMPLS-
   controlled networks such as wavelength, TDM-based or Ethernet-based
   networks as well.

   [RFC4655] and [RFC4657] discuss the framework and requirements for
   PCE on both packet MPLS networks and GMPLS-controlled networks.  This
   document complements these RFCs by providing some considerations of
   GMPLS applications in the intra-domain and inter-domain networking
   environments and indicating a set of requirements for the extended
   definition of PCE-related protocols.

   Note that the requirements for inter-layer traffic engineering
   described in [RFC6457] are outside of the scope of this document.

   Constraint-based shortest path first (CSPF) computation within a
   domain or over domains for signaling GMPLS Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs) is usually more stringent than that of MPLS TE LSPs [RFC4216],
   because the additional constraints, e.g., interface switching
   capability, link encoding, link protection capability and so forth
   need to be considered to establish GMPLS LSPs.  GMPLS signaling
   protocol [RFC3473] is designed taking into account bi-directionality,
   switching type, encoding type, SRLGs and protection attributes of the
   TE links spanned by the path, as well as LSP encoding and switching
   type of the end points, appropriately.

   This document provides the investigated results of GMPLS applications
   of PCE for the support of GMPLS path computation.  This document also
   provides requirements for GMPLS applications of PCE in GMPLS intra-
   domain and inter-domain environments.


2.  GMPLS applications of PCE

2.1.  Path computation in GMPLS network

   Figure 1 depicts a typical GMPLS network, consisting of an ingress
   link, a transit link as well as an egress link, to investigate a
   consistent guideline for GMPLS path computation.  Each link at each
   interface has its own switching capability, encoding type and
   bandwidth.

                Figure 1: Path computation in GMPLS networks

   For the simplicity in consideration, the below basic assumptions are
   made when the LSP is created.

   (1) Switching capabilities of outgoing links from the ingress and
   egress nodes (link1-2 and link4-3 in Figure 1) are consistent with
   each other.

   (2) Switching capabilities of all transit links including incoming
   links to the ingress and egress nodes (link2-1 and link3-4) are
   consistent with switching type of a LSP to be created.

   (3) Encoding-types of all transit links are consistent with encoding
   type of a LSP to be created.

   GMPLS-controlled networks (e.g., GMPLS-based TDM networks) are
   usually responsible for transmitting data for the client layer.
   These GMPLS-controlled networks can provide different types of
   connections for customer services based on different service
   bandwidth requests.

   The applications and the corresponding additional requirements for
   applying PCE to, for example, GMPLS-based TDM networks, are described
   in Figure 2.  In order to simplify the description, this document
   just discusses the scenario in SDH networks as an example.  The
   scenarios in SONET or G.709 ODUk layer networks are similar to this
   scenario.

                  Figure 2: A simple TDM (SDH) network

   Figure 2 shows a simple TDM (SDH) network topology, where N1, N2, N3,
   N4 and N5 are all SDH switches.  Assume that one Ethernet service
   with 100M bandwidth is required from A1 to A2 over this network.  The
   client Ethernet service could be provided by a VC4 connection from N1
   to N4, and it could also be provided by three concatenated VC3
   connections (Contiguous or Virtual concatenation) from N1 to N4.

   In this scenario, when the ingress node (e.g., N1) receives a client
   service transmitting request, the type of connections (one VC4 or
   three concatenated VC3) could be determined by PCC (e.g., N1 or NMS),
   but could also be determined by PCE automatically based on policy
   [RFC5394].  If it is determined by PCC, PCC should be capable of
   specifying the ingress node and egress node, signal type, the type of
   the concatenation and the number of the concatenation in a PCReq
   message.  PCE should consider those parameters during path
   computation.  The route information (co-route or separated-route)
   should be specified in a PCRep message if path computation is
   performed successfully.

   As described above, PCC should be capable of specifying TE attributes
   defined in the next section and PCE should compute a path
   accordingly.

   Where a GMPLS network is consisting of inter-domain (e.g., inter-AS
   or inter-area) GMPLS-controlled networks, requirements on the path
   computation follows [RFC5376] and [RFC4726].

2.2.  Unnumbered Interface

   GMPLS supports unnumbered interface ID that is defined in [RFC3477],
   which means that the endpoints of the path may be unnumbered.  It
   should also be possible to request a path consisting of the mixture
   of numbered links and unnumbered links, or a P2MP path with different
   types of endpoints.  Therefore, the PCC should be capable of
   indicating the unnumbered interface ID of the endpoints in the PCReq
   message.

2.3.  Asymmetric Bandwidth Path Computation

   As per [RFC6387], GMPLS signaling can be used for setting up an
   asymmetric bandwidth bidirectional LSP.  If a PCE is responsible for
   the path computation, the PCE should be capable of computing a path
   for the bidirectional LSP with asymmetric bandwidth.  It means that
   the PCC should be able to indicate the asymmetric bandwidth
   requirements in forward and reverse directions in the PCReq message.


3.  Requirements for GMPLS application of PCE

3.1.  Requirements on Path Computation Request

   As for path computation in GMPLS-controlled networks as discussed in
   section 2, the PCE should consider the GMPLS TE attributes
   appropriately once a PCC or another PCE requests a path computation.
   Indeed, the path calculation request message from the PCC or the PCE
   must contain the information specifying appropriate attributes.
   According to [RFC5440], [PCE-WSON-REQ] and to RSVP procedures like
   explicit label control(ELC),the additional attributes introduced are
   as follows:

   (1) Switching capability: PSC1-4, L2SC, DCSC [RFC6002], EVPL
   [RFC6004], 802_1 PBB-TE [RFC6060], TDM, lambda, LSC, FSC

   (2) Encoding type: as defined in [RFC4202], [RFC4203], e.g.,
   Ethernet, SONET/SDH, Lambda, etc.

   (3) Signal Type: Indicates the type of elementary signal that
   constitutes the requested LSP.  A lot of signal types with different
   granularity have been defined in SONET/SDH and G.709 ODUk, such as
   VC11, VC12, VC2, VC3 and VC4 in SDH, and ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3 in G.709
   ODUk.  See [RFC4606], [RFC4328] and [OSPF-G709] or [RSVP-TE-G709].

   (4) Concatenation Type: In SDH/SONET and G.709 ODUk networks, two
   kinds of concatenation modes are defined: contiguous concatenation
   which requires co-route for each member signal and requires all the



Otani, et al.          Expires September 13, 2013               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         Reqs for GMPLS apps of PCE             March 2013


   interfaces along the path to support this capability, and virtual
   concatenation which allows diverse routes for the member signals and
   only requires the ingress and egress interfaces to support this
   capability.  Note that for the virtual concatenation, it also may
   specify co-routed or separated-routed.  See [RFC4606] and [RFC4328]
   about concatenation information.

   (5) Concatenation Number: Indicates the number of signals that are
   requested to be contiguously or virtually concatenated.  Also see
   [RFC4606] and [RFC4328].

   (6) Technology-specific label(s) such as defined in [RFC4606],
   [RFC6060], [RFC6002] or [RFC6205].

   (7) e2e Path protection type: as defined in [RFC4872], e.g., 1+1
   protection, 1:1 protection, (pre-planned) rerouting, etc.

   (8) Administrative group: as defined in [RFC3630]

   (9) Link Protection type: as defined in [RFC4203]

   (10)Support for unnumbered interfaces: as defined in [RFC3477]

   (11)Support for asymmetric bandwidth request: as defined in [RFC6387]

   (12)Support for explicit label control during the path computation.

   (13)Support of label restrictions in the requests/responses,
   similarly to RSVP-TE ERO and XRO as defined in [RFC3473] and
   [RFC4874].

3.2.  Requirements on Path Computation Reply

   As described above, a PCE should compute the path that satisfies the
   constraints which are specified in the PCReq message.  Then the PCE
   should send a PCRep message including the computation result to the
   PCC.  For Path Computation Reply message (PCRep) in GMPLS networks,
   there are some additional requirements.  The PCEP PCRep message must
   be extended to meet the following requirements.

   (1) Path computation with concatenation

   In the case of path computation involving concatenation, when a PCE
   receives the PCReq message specifying the concatenation constraints
   described in section 3.1, the PCE should compute a path accordingly.

   For path computation involving contiguous concatenation, a single
   route is required and all the interfaces along the route should



Otani, et al.          Expires September 13, 2013               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         Reqs for GMPLS apps of PCE             March 2013


   support contiguous concatenation capability.  Therefore, the PCE
   should compute a path based on the contiguous concatenation
   capability of each interface and only one ERO which should carry the
   route information for the response.

   For path computation involving virtual concatenation, only the
   ingress/egress interfaces need to support virtual concatenation
   capability and there may be diverse routes for the different member
   signals.  Therefore, multiple EROs may be needed for the response.
   Each ERO may represent the route of one or multiple member signals.
   In the case where one ERO represents several member signals among the
   total member signals, the number of member signals along the route of
   the ERO must be specified.

   (2) Label constraint

   In the case that a PCC does not specify the exact label(s) when
   requesting a label-resctricted path and the PCE is capable of
   performing the route computation and label assignment computation
   procedure, the PCE needs to be able to specify the label of the path
   in a PCRep message.

   Wavelength restriction is a typical case of label restriction.  More
   generally in GMPLS-controlled networks label switching and selection
   constraints may apply and a PCC may request a PCE to take label
   constraint into account and return an ERO containing the label or set
   of label that fulfil the PCC request.

   (3) Roles of the routes

   When a PCC specifies the protection type of an LSP, the PCE should
   compute the working route and the corresponding protection route(s).
   Therefore, the PCRep should allow to distinguish the working
   (nominal) and the protection routes.

3.3.  GMPLS PCE Management

   PCE-related Management Information Bases must consider extensions to
   be satisfied with requirements for GMPLS applications.  For
   extensions, [RFC4802] are defined to manage TE database and may be
   referred to so as to accommodate GMPLS TE attributes in the PCE.


4.  Security Considerations

   PCEP extensions to support GMPLS should be considered under the same
   security as current PCE work.  This extension will not change the
   underlying security issues.
