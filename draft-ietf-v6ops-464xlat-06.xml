    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an architecture (464XLAT) for providing limited IPv4 connectivity across an IPv6-only network by combining existing and well-known stateful protocol translation RFC 6146 in the core and stateless protocol translation RFC 6145 at the edge. 464XLAT is a simple and scalable technique to quickly deploy limited IPv4 access service to IPv6-only edge networks without encapsulation.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The IANA unallocated IPv4 address pool was exhausted on February 3, 2011. Each RIR's unallocated IPv4 address pool will exhaust in the near future. It will be difficult for many networks to assign IPv4 addresses to end users, despite substantial IP connectivity growth required for fast growing edge networks.</t>

      <t>This document describes an IPv4 over IPv6 solution as one of the techniques for IPv4 service extension and encouragement of IPv6 deployment. 464XLAT is not a one for one replacement of full IPv4 functionality. The 464XLAT architecture only supports IPv4 in the client server model, where the server has global IPv4 address. This means it is not fit for IPv4 peer-to-peer communication or inbound IPv4 connections. 464XLAT builds on IPv6 transport and includes full any to any IPv6 communication.</t>

      <t>The 464XLAT architecture described in this document uses IPv4/IPv6 translation standardized in <xref target="RFC6145"></xref> and <xref target="RFC6146"></xref>. It does not require DNS64 [RFC6147] since an IPv4 host may simply send IPv4 packets, including packets to an IPv4 DNS server, which will be translated on the CLAT to IPv6 and back to IPv4 on the PLAT. 464XLAT networks may use DNS64 <xref target="RFC6147"></xref> to enable single stateful translation <xref target="RFC6146"></xref> instead of 464XLAT double translation where possible. The 464XLAT architecture encourages IPv6 transition by making IPv4 services reachable across IPv6-only networks and providing IPv6 and IPv4 connectivity to single-stack IPv4 or IPv6 servers and peers.</t>

      <t>By combining 464XLAT with BIH <xref target="RFC6535"></xref>, it is also possible to provide single IPv4 to IPv6 translation service, which will be needed in the future case of IPv6-only servers and peers to be reached from legacy IPv4-only hosts across IPv6-only networks.</t>

	<t hangText="CLAT:">CLAT is Customer side translator(XLAT) that complies with <xref target="RFC6145"></xref>. It algorithmically translates 1:1 private IPv4 packets to global IPv6 packets, and vice versa. The CLAT function is applicable to a router or an end-node such as a mobile phone. CLAT SHOULD perform router function to facilitate packets forwarding through the stateless translation even if it is an end-node. In the case where the access network does not allow for a dedicated IPv6 prefix for translation, a NAT44 SHOULD be used between the router function and the stateless translator function. The CLAT as a common home router or 3G router is expected to perform gateway functions such as DHCP server and DNS proxy for local clients. The CLAT does not comply with the sentence "Both IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses and IPv4-converted IPv6 addresses SHOULD use the same prefix." that is described on Section 3.3 in <xref target="RFC6052"></xref> due to using different IPv6 prefixes for CLAT-side and PLAT-side IPv4 addresses.</t>

      <t>The private IPv4 host on this diagram can reach global IPv4 hosts via translation on both CLAT and PLAT. On the other hand, the IPv6 host can reach other IPv6 hosts on the Internet directly without translation.  This means that the CPE can not only have the function of CLAT but also the function of IPv6 native router for IPv6 native traffic.</t>

      <section title="Wireline Network Applicability">

      <t>When an ISP has IPv6 464XLAT, the ISP can provide outgoing IPv4 service to end users across an IPv6 access network.  The result is that edge network growth is no longer tightly coupled to the availability of scarce IPv4 addresses.</t>

      <t>If the IXP or another provider operates the PLAT, the edge ISP is only required to deploy an IPv6 access network.  All ISPs do not need IPv4 access networks. They can migrate their access network to a simple and highly scalable IPv6-only environment.</t>

      <t>Incidentally, the effectiveness of 464XLAT was confirmed in the WIDE camp Spring 2012. The result is described in <xref target="I-D.hazeyama-widecamp-ipv6-only-experience"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Wireless 3GPP Network Applicability">

     <t>The vast majority of mobile networks are compliant to Pre-Release 9 3GPP standards. In Pre-Release 9 3GPP networks, GSM and UMTS networks must signal and support both IPv4 and IPv6 Packet Data Protocol (PDP) attachments to access IPv4 and IPv6 network destinations <xref target="RFC6459"></xref>. Since there are 2 PDPs required to support 2 address families, this is double the number of PDPs required to support the status quo of 1 address family, which is IPv4.</t>

      <t>464XLAT in combination with stateful translation <xref target="RFC6146"></xref> and DNS64 <xref target="RFC6147"></xref> allows 85% of the Android applications to continue to work with single translation or native IPv6 access. For the remaining 15% of applications that require IPv4 connectivity, the CLAT function on the UE provides a private IPv4 address and IPv4 default-route on the host for the applications to reference and bind to.  Connections sourced from the IPv4 interface are immediately routed to the CLAT function and passed to the IPv6-only mobile network, destine to the PLAT. In summary, the UE has the CLAT function that does a stateless translation <xref target="RFC6145"></xref>, but only when required. The mobile network has a PLAT that does stateful translation <xref target="RFC6146"></xref>.</t>

      <t>464XLAT works with today's existing systems as much as possible. 464XLAT is compatible with existing network based deep packet inspection solutions like 3GPP standardized Policy and Charging Control (PCC) <xref target="TS.23203"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The above chart shows most common traffic types and traffic treatment.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="DNS Proxy Implementation">
          <t>The CLAT SHOULD implement a DNS proxy as defined in <xref target="RFC5625"></xref>. The case of an IPv4-only node behind CLAT querying an IPv4 DNS server is undesirable since it requires both stateful and stateless translation for each DNS lookup. The CLAT SHOULD set itself as the DNS server via DHCP or other means and proxy DNS queries for IPv4 and IPv6 clients. Using the CLAT enabled home router or UE as a DNS proxy is a normal consume gateway function and simplifies the traffic flow so that only IPv6 native queries are made across the access network. The CLAT SHOULD allow for a client to query any DNS server of its choice and bypass the proxy.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="CLAT in a Gateway">
          <t>The CLAT is a stateless translation feature which can be implemented in a common home router or mobile phone that has a mobile router feature. The router with CLAT function SHOULD provide common router services such as DHCP of <xref target="RFC1918"></xref> addresses, DHCPv6, and DNS service. The router SHOULD set itself as the DNS server advertised via DHCP or other means to the clients so that it may implement the DNS proxy function to avoid double translation of DNS request.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="CLAT to CLAT communications">
          <t>While CLAT to CLAT IPv4 communication may work when the client IPv4 subnets do not overlap, this traffic flow is out of scope. 464XLAT is a hub and spoke architecture focused on enabling IPv4-only services over IPv6-only access networks.</t>
        </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Deployment Considerations">
          <t>Even if the Internet access provider for consumers is different from the PLAT provider (e.g. another internet access provider), it can implement traffic engineering independently from the PLAT provider. Detailed reasons are below:</t>

      <t><list hangIndent="4" style="hanging">
	<t hangText="1.">The Internet access provider for consumers can figure out IPv4 destination address from translated IPv6 packet header, so it can implement traffic engineering based on IPv4 destination address (e.g. traffic monitoring for each IPv4 destination address, packet filtering for each IPv4 destination address, etc.).  The tunneling methods do not have such a advantage, without any deep packet inspection for processing the inner IPv4 packet of the tunnel packet.</t>

	<t hangText="2.">If the Internet access provider for consumers can assign IPv6 prefix greater than /64 for each subscriber, this 464XLAT architecture can separate IPv6 prefix for native IPv6 packets and XLAT prefix for IPv4/IPv6 translation packets. Accordingly, it can identify the type of packets ("native IPv6 packets" and "IPv4/IPv6 translation packets"), and implement traffic engineering based on IPv6 prefix.</t>
      </list></t>

          <t>This 464XLAT architecture has two capabilities.  One is a IPv4 -> IPv6 -> IPv4 translation for sharing global IPv4 addresses, another, if combined with BIH <xref target="RFC6535"></xref>, is a IPv4 -> IPv6 translation for reaching IPv6-only servers from IPv4-only clients that can not support IPv6.  IPv4-only clients must be support through the long period of global transition to IPv6.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>To implement a PLAT, see security considerations presented in Section 5 of <xref target="RFC6146"></xref>.</t>

      <t>To implement a CLAT, see security considerations presented in Section 7 of <xref target="RFC6145"></xref>. The CLAT MAY comply with <xref target="RFC6092"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA is requested to reserve a Modified EUI-64 identifier for 464XLAT according to section 2.2.2 of <xref target="RFC5342"></xref>.  Its suggested value is 02-00-5E-00-00-00-00-00 to 02-00-5E-0F-FF-FF-FF-FF or 02-00-5E-10-00-00-00-00 to 02-00-5E-EF-FF-FF-FF-FF, depending on whether it should be taken in reserved or available values.</t>
