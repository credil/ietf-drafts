                      DKIM is Harmful as Specified
                       draft-otis-dkim-harmful-00

Abstract

   Currently, email lacks conventions ensuring SMTP clients can be
   identified by an authenticated domain.  Unfortunately many hope to
   use DKIM as an alternative, but it is independent of intended
   recipients and domains accountable for sending the message.  This
   means DKIM is poorly suited for establishing abuse assessments for
   unsolicited messaging of commercial email otherwise known as SPAM,
   nor was this initially DKIM's intent.  DKIM lacks message context
   essential to ensure fair assessment and to ensure this assessment is
   not poisoned.

   DKIM was instead intended to establish increased levels of trust
   based upon valid DKIM signatures controlling acceptance and what a
   user sees within the FROM header field.  But DKIM failed to guard
   against pre-pended header fields where any acceptance based on valid
   DKIM signatures is sure to exclude header field spoofing, especially
   that of the FROM.  This weakness allows malefactors to exploit DKIM
   signature acceptance established by high-volume DKIM domains to spoof
   ANY other domain, even when prohibited within the Signer's network.

Internet-Draft                DKIM-HARMFUL                      May 2013


1.  Introduction

   Currently, IPv4 address reputation provides the primary basis for
   defending SMTP open services.  Use of IP addresses in this role
   completely breaks down when dealing with IPv6 [RFC2460].  There are
   currently 18,209,237,415,985,168 /64 equivalent IPv6 prefixes routed.
   [v6-BGP-Rpts].  In comparison, for IPv4 there are 2,614,711,792 IP
   addresses routed.  While IPv4 is reaching its maximum, IPv6 has about
   0.1% of the available /64 prefix routed and this continues to grow
   rapidly.  Unlike IPv4, there is no practical means to scan reverse
   DNS namespace within IPv6 since each /64 prefix may contain any
   number of PTR records ranging up to 184,000,000,000,000,000,000.

   A technique commonly employed to automate IPv4 address categorization
   of suitable hosts is to check whether reverse PTR records appear to
   represent valid hostnames.  Those that represent 4 decimal numbers
   are often considered unacceptable, for example.  Our processing of
   reverse DNS namespace in cooperation with network providers now
   excludes about 38%, or about 1,000,000,000 IPv4 addresses.  Comparing
   IPv6 /64 prefixes with the remainder of routable IPv4 addresses shows
   there are 11.3 million times more IPv6 /64 prefixes needing
   categorization.  In addition, there is no practical means to
   facilitate this effort.

   Some also suggest there will not be a significant increase in the
   number of servers running over IPv6 and since their overall number
   should be comparable, email should still be dealing with a similar
   number of IP addresses.  Unlike IPv4, IPv6 does not constrain the
   number of IP addresses assigned to a network interface.  This feature
   allows each connection from a server to originate from a different IP
   address over the entire life of its operation while also having an
   ability to effortlessly change /64 prefixes.  The potential increase
   allowed by IPv6 may prove explosive.

   Many now hope DKIM will be able to offer a domain identity to provide
   a basis for acceptance to replace that of the IP address used by SMTP
   clients.  With a lack of uptake by commercial reputation services,
   there are proposals within the IETF aimed at establishing DKIM as a
   basis for reputation schemes in the Repute WG.  When such an ill-
   considered effort is combined with DKIM's inability to detect invalid
   prefixed header fields, the results can prove highly harmful.


2.  Maintaining Trust

   Not every subsystem or protocol layer should be expected to repeat
   previous security checks, however critical checks should not be
   assumed, especially those that involve a trivial amount of effort.

   With high levels of abuse resulting from email's open nature,
   delegating checks in a structured manner better conserves essential
   resources.  However, email's highly distributed store and forward
   protocol could not function if rigid message structures were enforced
   by the transport.  New authentication or presentation requirements
   may involve small structural adjustments.  For example,
   internationalization introduced a format negotiation not assured to
   survive beyond the next hop.


3.  Responding to Defects and Exploitation

   With the advent of aviation, the world marveled at the skill and
   intellect taking us to ever greater heights.  With aviation, faults
   threatening security, that when found, demanded our attention and
   diligence to effect repair.  As with aviation, the success of email
   has risen to great heights.  Email has become an integral component
   in general commerce and the maintenance of security such as reporting
   system failures, break-in attempts, and facilitating account access
   recovery.

   Reporting or predicting failure should not be viewed as exhibiting a
   lack of respect for achieved accomplishments.  Noting and repairing
   faults only signify the importance of email's prominent role.  As
   with most security related protocols, responding to noted defects is
   fairly common.  Not responding to discovered defects in a security
   related protocol would be shocking.


4.  SMTP Can't

   SMTP [RFC5321] recommends against rejecting messages based upon
   perceived defects in the message structure.  This liberal acceptance
   permits evolutionary changes in message specifications starting at
   [RFC0822] that was based on [RFC0733] replaced by [RFC2822] and again
   by [RFC5322], [RFC6152], [RFC6532], and [RFC6854]; the second to last
   paragraph in section 3 of [RFC5321] provides a definitive statement
   messages should not be rejected due to perceived defects in the
   [RFC0822] message structure.  The initial reference to [RFC0822] in
   this paragraph offers two foot notes with the second referencing the
   latest version of [RFC0822] which is [RFC5322] which itself has
   recently been updated.  The impact of initially removing text
   specifically indicating which header fields are not to repeat is
   unknown.  This information was implied within the then-new ABNF
   notation.  Clarifying text for this requirement did not return until
   the [RFC0822] revision 19 years later which also indicates this
   specification's success at providing a foundation that allowed email
   to flourish.

   There are many SMTP servers that have been in operation for decades
   with years passing between security patches.  Such an accomplishment
   is most remarkable considering the volume of traffic being handled,
   often from highly malicious sources.  This amazing stability and
   scalability with high levels of security would not have been possible
   if SMTP had been expected to validate message formats.

   Expecting SMTP to validate message formats to protect against
   vulnerabilities pertaining to protocols such as DKIM does not scale.
   The general use of DKIM permits signature checks subsequent to
   acceptance where only the status of signatures determines internal
   placement.  As such, it becomes critical to ensure a valid signature
   is never declared having malformed header field stacks.  To
   accomplish this, the DKIM specification must change.


5.  DKIM Vulnerability

   DKIM permits a vulnerability by not checking the message header field
   stack for invalid repeats when signing or verifying a signature.  The
   DKIM signature process must walk both down and then up the header
   field stack while selecting the header fields to be included in the
   hash process of the signature.  The DKIM process will even ignore
   prefixed FROM header fields which is the only header field always
   included.

   The WG concluded that "listing non-existent header fields as signed"
   hack added in non-normative language together with opinions that
   checking for invalid repeated header fields is not to be considered
   DKIM's problem.  See section 8.15 of [RFC6376] where this issue was
   expressed as not an attack against the trust DKIM intends to convey,
   and thus not a concern for DKIM.  Nevertheless, improperly formed
   messages may display only the first of multiple header fields that,
   as a result of erroneous assumptions of there being no invalid
   repeated header fields, the prefixed header fields are likely to be
   displayed in lieu of those signed while not impacting DKIM's
   signature validity.

   DKIM incorrectly assumed the header field stack's starting condition,
   which DKIM itself is best able to determine, and is an option in the
   OpenDKIM implementation.  This is likely to astonish most recipients
   that DKIM failed to make a robust effort to maintain the trust it is
   attempting to convey.  Three members of the WG authored proposed
   changes aimed specifically at addressing this issue [DKIM-MH-Attack].
   At the time, some expressed concerns about whether this might set
   back DKIM's standardization process.  As such, DKIM Signers may sign
   malformed messages (e.g., violate [RFC5322]) and be in compliance
   with DKIM specifications.  In addition, receivers may verify these

Internet-Draft                DKIM-HARMFUL                      May 2013


   messages as having valid signatures despite multiple instances of a
   header field only permitted to occur once and also be in compliance
   with DKIM specifications.  See addendum for examples.

   Use of DKIM on such messages exposes a vulnerability in the
   evaluation process.  Rather than ensuring essential checks are made
   prior to producing a result, a wasteful hack was later suggested
   where extra non-existent header fields could be included in the list
   of signed header fields.  Any pre-pended header field added after
   signing would thereby change resulting hashes and invalidate the
   signature.  Not all domains are attempting to achieve the same level
   of trust and may be more sensitive to incurring incremental storage
   requirements.  Some domains may even inadvertently sign invalid
   repeated header fields because this check had not been required in
   the DKIM process.  These same DKIM domains are also likely to
   establish themselves as being Too Big To Block.  These TBTB domains
   can then be used to spoof other domains that may have otherwise
   established a high level of trust by implementing the hack where, due
   to this defect in DKIM, can still do nothing in their defense from
   the perspective of now deceived recipients.

   This vulnerability in DKIM represents an exploit allowing serious
   attacks caused by erroneous assumptions made in DKIM's signature
   process.  There is also a header field, which because of its label,
   may potentially mislead recipients into believing it contains valid
   "Authentication-Results" [RFC5451].  Common phrases such as
   "Authentication-Results", "pass", and "fail", rather than use of
   result codes belies introductory claims this header is not intended
   for direct human consumption.


6.  Barriers to an Authenticated Domain

   Some advocate use of DKIM as a means to obtain domain references
   based on the increased prevalence of this protocol.  DKIM is
   independent of the domain actually sending the message and the
   recipient by design.  Unfortunately, DKIM also does not attempt to
   protect against likely abuses that are also beyond the control of the
   signing domain in which DKIM signature validity conveys no assurance
   pre-fixed header fields have not changed what recipients see.  As
   such, DKIM signing domains can not be held accountable for incidents
   of abuse appearing to violate subscription policies or that spoof
   other domains.

   Because of DKIM's vulnerability to header field spoofing, it would
   never be safe to express positive reputations either.  Any such
   assurance could be exploited by malefactors to deceive those trusting
   DKIM results.  In short, a DKIM signed domain as currently defined,



Otis & Rand             Expires November 13, 2013               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                DKIM-HARMFUL                      May 2013


   can never be safely used in any context, other than the most rigid
   exclusion of any unsigned content which is well beyond any existing
   implementation.  It can never be used for email reputation as
   currently defined.


7.  Domains as a Basis for Managing Traffic

   A manageable basis for assessments can leverage a smaller number of
   related domains, compared to IPv6 or even IPv4 addresses.  Although
   technically the domain name space can be larger than the massively
   large IPv6 address space, in practice it is not.  One hundred
   thousand domains control 90% of Internet traffic out of approximately
   100 million domains active each month.  The top 150 domains control
   50% of the traffic, and the top 2,500 domains control 75%.  This
   level of domain consolidation permits effective fast-path white-
   listing.  Improvements achieved using domains to consolidate the
   threat landscape can easily justify added cryptographic
   authentication burdens.  Even APL resource records [RFC3123] can
   authenticate EHLO using a single DNS transaction, but this would not
   allow IPv6 email to be more easily managed, which cryptographic
   technology can offer.


8.  XMPP Shows the Way Forward

   In addition to SMTP [RFC5321] using StartTLS [RFC3207] XMPP [RFC6122]
   uses StartTLS [RFC6120] over a different port with many of the
   features used by web servers such as [RFC2560] as one means to
   increase scalability.  It seems plausible that by defining SMTP
   access over a different port is where a new authentication and
   international requirements can be resolved together.  Of course, port
   25 can be used, where it might require StartTLS in the case of IPv6
   connections.

   Many administrators overlook a serious problem made much worse by
   chatty protocols that impose processing delays.  Examining server
   logs will not reveal any problem either, because the limited resource
   being consumed is the number of outstanding connections TCP is able
   to support.  Reaching this limit will prevent new connections from
   being instantiated but this is not logged as an event.  Over time
   administrators may hear complaints email is not being delivered or
   just see an ever growing percentage of spam.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA consideration.

10.  Security Considerations

   This draft intends to describe serious security concerns raised with
   use of DKIM exacerbated with IPv6 email.  The contained
   recommendations are expected to reduce the security concerns.  To
   ensure security, the DKIM specification must change.
