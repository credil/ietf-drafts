             JSON Web Signature JSON Serialization (JWS-JS)
          draft-jones-json-web-signature-json-serialization-01

Abstract

   The JSON Web Signature JSON Serialization (JWS-JS) is a means of
   representing content secured with digital signatures or Hash-based
   Message Authentication Codes (HMACs) using JSON data structures.
   This specification describes a means of representing secured content
   as a JSON data object (as opposed to the JWS specification, which
   uses a compact serialization with a URL-safe representation).  It
   enables multiple digital signatures and/or HMACs to be applied to the
   same content (unlike JWS).  Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers
   used with this specification are enumerated in the separate JSON Web
   Algorithms (JWA) specification.  The JSON Serialization for related
   encryption functionality is described in the separate JSON Web
   Encryption JSON Serialization (JWE-JS) specification.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft       JWS JSON Serialization (JWS-JS)          March 2012


1.  Introduction

   The JSON Web Signature JSON Serialization (JWS-JS) is a format for
   representing content secured with digital signatures or Hash-based
   Message Authentication Codes (HMACs) as a JSON [RFC4627] object.  It
   enables multiple digital signatures and/or HMACs to be applied to the
   same content (unlike JWS [JWS]).  The digital signature and HMAC
   mechanisms used are independent of the type of content being secured,
   allowing arbitrary content to be secured.  Cryptographic algorithms
   and identifiers used with this specification are enumerated in the
   separate JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA] specification.  The JSON
   Serialization for related encryption functionality is described in
   the separate JSON Web Encryption JSON Serialization (JWE-JS) [JWE-JS]
   specification.


2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the same terminology as the JSON Web
   Signature (JWS) [JWS] specification.


3.  JSON Serialization

   The JSON Serialization represents secured content as a JSON object
   with members for each of three constituent parts: a "headers" member
   whose value is a non-empty array of Encoded JWS Header values, a
   "payload" member whose value is an Encoded JWS Payload value, and a
   "signatures" member whose value is a non-empty array of Encoded JWS
   Signature values, where the number of elements in both arrays is the
   same.

   Unlike the compact serialization used by JWSs, content using the JSON
   Serialization MAY be secured with more than one digital signature
   and/or HMAC value.  Each is represented as an Encoded JWS Signature
   in the "signatures" member array.  For each, there is a corresponding
   "headers" member array element that is an Encoded JWS Header
   specifying the digital signature or HMAC applied to the Encoded JWS
   Header value and the Encoded JWS Payload value to create the JWS
   Signature value.  Therefore, the syntax is:
   {"headers":["<header 1 contents>",...,"<header N contents>"],
    "payload":"<payload contents>",
    "signatures":["<signature 1 contents>",...,"<signature N contents>"]
   }

   The contents of the Encoded JWS Header, Encoded JWS Payload, and
   Encoded JWS Signature values are exactly as specified in JSON Web
   Signature (JWS) [JWS].  They are interpreted and validated in the

   same manner, with each corresponding "headers" and "signatures" value
   being created or validated together.  The arrays MUST have the same
   number of elements.

   The i'th JWS Signature value is computed on the JWS Secured Input
   corresponding to the concatenation of the i'th Encoded JWS Header, a
   period ('.') character, and the Encoded JWS Payload in the same
   manner described in the JWS specification.  This has the desirable
   result that each Encoded JWS signature value in the "signatures"
   array is identical to the value that would be used for the same
   header and payload in a JWS.


4.  Example JWS-JS

   This section contains an example using the JWS JSON Serialization.
   This example demonstrates the capability for conveying multiple
   digital signatures and/or HMACs for the same payload.

   The Encoded JWS Payload used in this example is the same as used in
   the examples in Appendix A of JWS (with line breaks for display
   purposes only):
   eyJpc3MiOiJqb2UiLA0KICJleHAiOjEzMDA4MTkzODAsDQogImh0dHA6Ly9leGFt
   cGxlLmNvbS9pc19yb290Ijp0cnVlfQ

   Two digital signatures are used in this example: an RSA SHA-256
   signature, for which the header and signature values are the same as
   in Appendix A.2 of JWS, and an ECDSA P-256 SHA-256 signature, for
   which the header and signature values are the same as in Appendix A.3
   of JWS.  The two Decoded JWS Header Segments used are:
   {"alg":"RS256"}

   and:
   {"alg":"ES256"}

   Since the computations of the JWS Header and JWS Signature values are
   the same as in Appendix A.2 and Appendix A.3 of JWS, they are not
   repeated here.

   The complete JSON Web Signature JSON Serialization (JWS-JS) for these
   values is as follows (with line breaks for display purposes only):

5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification makes no requests of IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for this specification are the same as
   those for the JSON Web Signature (JWS) [JWS] specification.
