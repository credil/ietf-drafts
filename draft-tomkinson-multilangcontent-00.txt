                     Multiple Language Content Type
                  draft-tomkinson-multilangcontent-00

Abstract

   This document defines an addition to the Multipurpose Internet Mail
   Extensions (MIME) standard to make it possible to send one message
   that contains multiple language versions of the same information.
   The translations would be identified by a language code and selected
   by the email client based on a user's language settings or locale.

Internet-Draft       Multiple Language Content Type             Oct 2013


1.  Introduction

   Since the invention of email and the rapid spread of the internet,
   more and more people have been able to communicate in more and more
   countries and in more and more languages.  But during this time of
   technological evolution, email has remained a single language
   communication tool, whether it is English to English, Spanish to
   Spanish or Japanese to Japanese.

   Also during this time, many corporations have established their
   offices in multi-cultural cities and formed departments and teams
   that span continents, cultures and languages so the need to
   communicate efficiently with little margin for miscommunication has
   grown exponentially.

   The objective of this document is to define an addition to the widely
   used Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) standard, to make
   it possible to send a single message to a group of people in such a
   way that all of the recipients can read the email in their own first
   language.  The methods of translation of the message content are
   beyond the scope of this document, but the structure of the email
   itself is presented herein.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  The Content-Type Header

   When there is a requirement to send a message in a number of
   different languages and the translations are to be embedded in the
   same message, the multipart subtype "multipart/multilingual" SHOULD
   be used to help the receiving email client make sense of the message
   structure.

   The suggested multipart subtype "multipart/multilingual" has the same
   semantics as "multipart/alternative" (as discussed in RFC 2046
   [RFC2046]) in that each of the body parts is an alternative version
   of the same information.  The primary difference between "multipart/
   multilingual" and "multipart/alternative" is that when using
   "multipart/multilingual", the message part to select for rendering is
   chosen based on the value of the Content-Language header instead of
   the ordering of the parts and the Content-Types.

   The syntax for this multipart subtype conforms to the common syntax

Internet-Draft       Multiple Language Content Type             Oct 2013


   for subtypes of multipart given in section 5.1.1. of RFC 2046
   [RFC2046], therefore, an example "multipart/multilingual" Content-
   Type header field would look like this:

   Content-type: multipart/multilingual; boundary=01189998819991197253


3.  The Multilingual Preface -- the first message part

   In order for the message to be received and displayed in non-
   conforming email clients, the message MUST contain an explanatory
   message part which MUST-NOT be marked with a Content-Language header
   but MUST be the first of the message parts.  Because non-conforming
   email clients are expected to treat the message as multipart/mixed
   (in accordance with sections 5.1.3 and 5.1.7 of RFC 2046 [RFC2046])
   they may show all of the message parts sequentially or as
   attachments.  Including and showing this explanatory part will help
   the message recipient understand the message structure.

   This initial message part SHOULD explain briefly to the message
   recipient that the message contains multiple languages and the parts
   may be rendered sequentially or as attachments.  This SHOULD be
   presented in the same languages that are provided in the subsequent
   message parts.

   Whilst this section of the message is useful for backward
   compatibility, it SHOULD only be shown when rendered by a non-
   conforming email client because conforming email client SHOULD only
   show the single message part identified by the user's preferred
   language (or locale) and the message part's Content-Language.


4.  The Subsequent Message Parts

   The subsequent message parts are translations of the same message
   content.  These body parts MAY be ordered so that the first part
   after the multilingual preface is in the language believed to be the
   most likely to be recognised by recipients using software that does
   not implement multipart/multilingual.

   The Content-Type for each individual language part MAY be any MIME
   type (including multipart subtypes such as multipart/alternative).
   However, it is recommended that the Content-Type of the language
   parts is kept as simple as possible for interoperability with
   existing email clients.  The language parts are not required to have
   matching Content-Types or multipart structures.  For example, there
   might be an English part of type "text/html" followed by a Spanish
   part of type "application/pdf" followed by a Chinese part of type

   "image/jpeg".  Whatever the content-type, the contents SHOULD be
   composed for optimal viewing in the specified language.


5.  The Content-Language Header

   The Content-Language header in the individual multipart message parts
   is used to identify the language in which the message part is
   written.  Based on the value of this header, a conforming email
   client can determine which message part to display (given the user's
   language settings or locale).

   The Content-Language MUST comply with RFC 3282 [RFC3282] which fully
   defines how the language is identified.  This makes use of ISO 639
   [ISO639] coding of languages.  An example of this header could look
   like the following:

   Content-Language: en


6.  The Subject-Translation Header

   On receipt of the message, conforming email clients will need to
   select the correct multipart message content and replace the subject
   that is shown to the message recipient with the translated subject.
   To enable this the Subject-Translation header SHOULD be provided in
   each message part that contains a Content-Language header.

   The value for this header should be a simple translated version of
   the original email subject.  An example of this header may look like
   this:

   Subject-Translation: Mensaje de ejemplo para varios idiomas
