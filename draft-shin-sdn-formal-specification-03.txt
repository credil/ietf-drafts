   Formal Specification Framework for Software-Defined Networks (SDN)
                 draft-shin-sdn-formal-specification-03

Abstract         

   This document discusses formally verifiable networking framework for
   software-defined networks (SDN). In SDN, incomplete or malicious
   programmable entities could cause break-down of underlying networks
   shared by heterogeneous devices and stake-holders. Formally
   verifiable networking can provide a logic-based framework to unify
   the design, specification, verification, and implementation of SDN.
   This framework describes formal specification and verification
   process for SDN. In addition, we present two examples of formal
   specification for a part of SDN using a process algebra called
   Algebra of Communicating Shard Resources (ACSR) and Z specification
   languages.

Internet-Draft        Formal Specification for SDN     February 15, 2013


1. Introduction

   Software-defined networking (SDN) is emerging and intensively
   discussed as one of the most promising technologies to make networks
   programmable and flexible and introduce network virtualization within
   data centers, enterprise networks, mobile networks, etc. [I-D.nadeau-
   sdn-problem-statement],[b-OpenFlow]. SDN is defined as a new
   networking approach which enables network operators and/or
   application/service providers to add their own processing, control,
   program, etc. through open network interfaces and network abstraction
   into their networks so that they can directly control and manage
   their networks and resources to best serve their customers' needs.
   With SDN, network operators and application/service providers can
   introduce a new capability easily by writing a simple software
   program.

   To design and implement networks that conform to the design goals of
   SDN network topology, the structure and behavior of the networks need
   to be formally specified to prevent from misinterpreting of the
   intended meanings and to avoid inconsistency in the networks.
   Furthermore, SDN networks can be used for safety-critical systems
   such as avionic and automotive systems, nuclear power plants, and
   medical devices, and those systems should be verified to guarantee
   their reliability and security properties, otherwise catastrophic
   disaster could be occurred. Other areas that the SDN networks can be
   applied, such as private clouds and data centers, also benefit from
   formal specification and analysis since any inconsistencies in the
   systems and unexpected errors that could not be caught during design
   process can result in network breakdown or system failure, which can
   lead to tremendous commercial loss [b-Nam12].

   This document discusses formally verifiable networking framework for
   SDN. Formally verifiable networking can provide a logic-based
   framework to unify the design, specification, verification, and
   implementation of SDN.  This framework presents formal specification
   and verification process for SDN.


2. SDN Discussion and Assumption

   SDN architectural issues are not fully investigated yet, because it
   is very difficult to build a single SDN architecture to accommodate
   and harmonize various requirements from network operators,
   application/service providers and vendors' perspectives. Therefore,
   it is assumed that SDN has three-tier architecture as illustrated in
   Figure 1.

2.1 Requirements for SDN Programming

   This document presents initial thoughts on requirements of SDN
   application programming. 

    R1: Guarantee that the design and implementation of SDN devices 
        conforms to the standards, correctness and safety properties.
    R2: Check consistency and safety of their network configurations 
        and virtual and physical topologies against any properties to 
        be satisfied with such as:
          - No loops and/or blackholes in the network
          - Logically different networks cannot interfere with each 
            other (e.g., traffic isolation)
          - New or update configurations conforms to properties of the 
            network and do not break consistency of existing networks 
           (e.g., network updates)
    R3: Support formal semantics in high-level languages, APIs and 
        underlying protocols for SDN
          - Properties that need to be satisfied with by the SDN should 
            be described in notations with formal semantics
    R4: Support conceptual models to reason about networks defined, 
        configured, implemented by software and hardware for SDN more 
        precisely.

            behaviors of packet flows and data traffic in
          - Formalisms that reflect networks and systems behaviors
          - Diverse languages and tools based on the conceptual model


3. Formally Verifiable Networking Framework for SDN

   SDN network operators and application/service providers can introduce
   a new capability by writing a simple software program. In SDN,
   incomplete or malicious programmable entities could cause break-down
   of underlying networks shared by heterogeneous devices and stake-
   holders. Formally verifiable networking in SDN can reduce any
   inconsistency or misunderstanding of the meaning of components and
   mechanisms because formal specification removes ambiguity in the
   informal specifications. Furthermore, formal specification can be
   applied to verification methods such as theorem proving, process
   algebraic analysis, model checking, and static analysis. 

   Figure 2 illustrates an overview of the formally verifiable
   networking framework for SDN, which consists of the three components,
   formal specification, verification methods, and implementation. SDN
   network operators and application/service providers design an
   abstract network model (e.g., virtual network topology) of desired
   properties informally. After then, the SDN network operators and
   application/service providers write down formal specification for the
   properties, which finally verifies that implementation (e.g., SDN
   control software) satisfies these properties.   

   In general, traditional methods of realizing network protocols and
   devices are based on community agreements of informal specification
   of such mechanisms. As depicted in Figure 2, those processes can be
   improved by applying formal methods in the development process of
   SDN. Targets of specification can range from conceptual model of
   components or mechanisms for SDN, logical switch/router models,
   network protocols, user-defined topologies of virtual networks, and
   so on. Informal specification of those targets can be encoded in
   formal specification languages that can best reflect the features of
   targets among the existing methods for formal specification. The
   formal specification can be textual form or graphical representation
   only if their semantics are defined formally and unambiguously. Once
   the specifications are described formally, system and protocol
   designer can check the existence of inconsistencies and possible
   errors in the specification with the help of formal methods experts
   or supporting tools. Any type of formal verification methods can be
   applied to this validation and verification process while each has
   pros and cons for this purpose. One may use theorem proving such as
   HOL, Isabelle, Coq, PVS with the help of assistant tools and experts,
   others can take advantage of full automation of this process by

4. Formal Specification and Verification for SDN 

   We discuss formal specifications about virtual network topology of
   SDN. The two researches that are most closely related to our work are
   NetCore [b-NetCore12] and NDlog [b-NDlog11]. But each has different
   perspectives. NetCore, the Network Core Programming Language, is a
   high-level and declarative language for expressing packet-forwarding
   policies and has a formal semantics. Network Datalog (NDlog) is
   distributed recursive query language used for querying network
   graphs.

   In this document, we propose to add SDN language compiler and tools
   such as verifier on top of SDN control software. Figure 3 illustrates
   formal specification and verification tools between SDN control
   software and applications.

   We consider developing new formal specification language with simple
   and minimum semantics to support new properties of SDN networks. At
   this moment, we use process algebra ACSR (Algebra of Communicating
   Shard Resources) [b-ACSR95] and Z specification language formally, as
   examples. To provide a correct and efficient solution for forwarding
   packets on the SDN, ACSR can express processes running concurrently
   and communicating switches and a controller. Forwarding packets can
   be modeled as prioritized synchronization of events in ACSR. In
   addition, Z specification for SDN is focused on each switch and
   controller for emphasis on their functionality. Based on this, we are
   researching to verify the SDN through the analysis of the requirement
   for OpenFlow.

5. Examples 

5.1 Formal Specification of SDN using ACSR 

   This clause describes an example of ACSR specification of SDN. In our
   process algebraic approaches, network entities are represented by
   processes in ACSR.

   ACSR is a formal specification and verification methods for behavior
   modeling using concepts of processes, resources, events, and
   priorities. ACSR, like other process algebras, consists of (1) a set
   of operators and syntactic rules for constructing process; (2) a
   semantic mapping which assigns meaning or interpretation to
   processes; (3) a notion of equivalence or partial order between
   process; and (4) a set of algebraic laws that allows syntactic
   manipulation of processes. ACSR uses two distinct action types to
   model computation: time and resource-consuming actions, and
   instantaneous events.

   ACSR distinguish two types of actions: those which consume time, and
   those which are instantaneous. Timed actions may require access to
   system resources, e.g., network bandwidth etc. In contrast,
   instantaneous actions provide a synchronization mechanism between
   concurrent processes. In this document, we use only instantaneous
   action to model SDN.

   Packet forwarding is specified as event sending and receiving. Packet
   matching with rules are represented by synchronization between input
   and output events. We provide a demonstration of ACSR specification
   of an example virtual networks.

   Let the example virtual networks have a topology shown in Figure 4.
   The topology consists of a single switch and three hosts (H1, H2, and
   H3).

   all detailed data in the packets. We assume that there are several
   types of packets forwarded between nodes in the networks as follows:

        +---------+----------+---------------------------+ 
        |  Sender | Receiver |      Types of packets     |
        +---------+----------+------------------------- -+
        |    H1   |  Switch  | packet1, packet2, packet3 |
        |  Switch |    H2    |          packet4          |
        |  Switch |    H3    |      packet5, packet6     |
        +---------+----------+---------------------------+

   We also assume that there are three types of rules in switch which
   are rule1, rule2 and rule3. Packets are matched to rules in the way
   as follows. The larger number indicates the higher priority. Note
   that packet1 can be matched to both rule2 and rule3 and packet2 can
   be matched to both rule2 and rule3.

       +--------------------------------------------------------+ 
       | Rule | Priority | Packets matched | Action on matching | 
       +--------------------------------------------------------+ 
       |rule1 |     4    |     packet1     |        action1     | 
       |rule2 |     3    |     packet1     |        action2     |
       |rule2 |     3    |     packet2     |        action2     |
       |rule3 |     6    |     packet2     |        action3     |

   The process 'Network' represents the example system being specified.
   'Network' consists of H1, H2, H3, and Switch, which are composed
   using the parallel operator because they are running in parallel and
   interacting each other. The specification of the process 'System' is
   as follows:


    Network = (H1||H2||H3||Switch)
              \{inPort,outPort1,outPort2,activatingRule1, 
              activatingRule2,activatingRule3};

   In an example topology in Figure 2, we assume that there are three
   hosts which are specified as ACSR processes 'H1', 'H2' and 'H3'. H1

   transmits to Switch packets such as packet1, packet2, and packet3. H2
   receives packets such as packet1 and packet3. H3 receives packets
   such as packet1 and packet2.


    H1 = (inPort!1,1).(inPort!2,1).(inPort!3,1).Host1;
    H2 = (outPort1?packet,1).Host2;
    H3 = (outPort2?packet,1).Host3;

   The switch in the example network consists of 'InputModule',
   'FlowTable', and 'OutputModule'. The specification of 'Switch',
   'InputModule', FlowTable', and 'OutputModule' are as follows:

    Switch = (InputModule||FlowTable(1,1,0)||OutputModule)
             \{rule1,rule2,rule3,rule0,action1,action2,action3};

    InputModule = (inPort?packet, 1).(
      cket = 1) -> ((rule1!,1).InputModule + (rule2!,1).InputModule)
      + (packet = 2) -> ((rule2!,1).InputModule + (rule3!,1).InputModule
      + (packet = 3) -> (rule3!,1).InputModule
      + (rule0!packet,0).InputModule
      );

    FlowTable(r1,r2,r3) =   
    (r1 = 1) -> (rule1?,4).(action1!,99).FlowTable(r1,r2,r3)
   	+ (r2 = 1) -> (rule2?,3).(action2!,99).FlowTable(r1,r2,r3)
   	+ (r3 = 1) -> (rule3?,6).(action3!,99).FlowTable(r1,r2,r3)
   	+ (activatingRule1?,99).FlowTable(1,r2,r3)
   	+ (activatingRule2?,99).FlowTable(r1,1,r3)
   	+ (activatingRule3?,99).FlowTable(r1,r2,1);
   	+ (rule0?packet,0).('requestRuleForPacket?packet,99).
                                        FlowTable(r1,r2,r3);

    OutputModule = (action1?,999).(outPort1!4, 1).OutputModule
   	      + (action2?,999).(outPort2!5, 1).OutputModule
   	      + (action3?,999).(outPort2!6, 1).OutputModule;

   We describe a portion of formal specification of the informal SDN
   specification using ACSR. ACSR can express processes running
   concurrently and communicating the switches and controller.
   Forwarding packets can be modeled as prioritized synchronization of
   events in ACSR. But the disadvantages of ACSR is that it is hard to
   categorize classification of data packets.

5.2. Formal Specification of SDN using Z 

   This clause describes an example of the Z specification for SDN that
   is comprised of lots of switches and a controller managing them. In

Internet-Draft        Formal Specification for SDN     February 15, 2013


   this specification, we focus on each one switch and controller for
   emphasis on their functionality of them. For an example, switch keeps
   a flowtable for handling input packets. This table has a fulfillment
   action for some packets, and can be modified by the controller

    Table_Type == HEADER_FIELD x N x F ACTION_TYPE 

   The table is made up of a packet header, applied counter and actions.
   The counter plays a role of priority, so when one packet matches more
   than two elements, actions having a higher counter value will be
   applied.

    PORT ::= port1 | port2 | port 3 | port 4
    PORT_STATUS ::= active | inactive 

   Switch also has ports for input or output and each port has a state (
   active or inactive ). In this specification, we assume that the
   switch has four ports.

    ACTION ::= Forward | Enqueue | Drop | Modify_Field
    OPTIONAL_ACTION ::=ALL | CONTROLLER | LOCAL | TABLE | IN_PORT | NONE
    ACTION_TYPE: ACTION <-> OPTIONAL_ACTION
    ACTION_TYPE Forward = {ALL, CONTROLLER, LOCAL, TABLE, IN_PORT}
    ACTION_TYPE Enqueue = NONE 
    ACTION_TYPE Drop = NONE  
    ACTION_TYPE Modify_Field = NONE 

   Actions stored in table are Forward, Enqueue, Drop and Modify Field,
   and forward action has four optional actions, ALL (meaning
   broadcast), LOCAL (multicast), IN PORT (unicast) and Controller (to
   controller).

    forwardToController
    headerNoMatchAction 
    packet: PACKET_TYPE
    packet.header =packet?.header
    packet.contents=packet?.contents
    packet.action={(Forward, CONTROLLER)}
    controller.packet={packet} 

   Z specification for SDN is focused on each switch and controller for
   emphasis on their functionality and it is possible of limited
   verification for SDN using Z specification. It can specify forwarding
   packets in limited hosts and switches, but it is difficult to specify
   various states of large networks in the real-world.

5.3 Subtle Ambiguities Discovery and Correctness Verification 

   We could find the overlooked subtleties in SDN networks during
   transforming from the topology and properties to ACSR and Z
   specification. Once a formal specification is made, it can be used
   for validating the network topology. 

   For example, in order to prove that the correctness of the ACSR and Z
   specifications, we can show that the specification has no deadlock.
   If the specification has no deadlock, we can claim that the network
   topology runs forever without any stop, which means the packet flow
   is well modeled.
