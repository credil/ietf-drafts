                   RSVP-TE LSP egress fast-protection
             draft-minto-rsvp-lsp-egress-fast-protection-03

Abstract

   RFC4090 defines a fast reroute mechanism for locally repairing an
   RSVP-TE LSP in the order of 10s of milliseconds, in the event of a
   downstream link or node failure.  However, this mechanism does not
   provide node protection for LSP egress nodes, even when an alternate
   egress node (a backup egress) is available that could carry the
   traffic to its ultimate destination.  This document addresses this
   scenario and describes how to provide egress protection by
   establishing a bypass LSP from the penultimate-hop node of a LSP to
   the backup egress node.  The methods described in this document
   enable local repair in the order of 10s of milliseconds, in the event
   of the egress node failure.  These methods are only applicable if
   traffic carried by the LSP can be rerouted to its ultimate
   destination by the backup egress node.

Internet-Draft     RSVP-TE LSP egress fast-protection           Nov 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document describes procedures for providing fast protection for
   RSVP-TE LSPs in case of the egress node failure.  Such protection can
   only be provided when an alternate egress node exists that can carry
   the traffic destined for the protected egress to its ultimate
   destination.  The primary egress node of an LSP (the protected
   egress) terminates the LSP in steady state, while the alternate
   egress node (the backup egress) does so when the primary fails.  A
   bypass LSP is established from the penultimate-hop node to the backup
   egress.  The penultimate-hop node, serving as a PLR (point of local
   repair), redirects traffic to the backup egress node of the LSP using
   this bypass LSP in the event of primary egress node failure.

   The backup egress node forwards the traffic to its ultimate
   destination using methods that are beyond the scope this document.
   For example, backup egress node could use the service specific
   mechanism specified in [pwe3-endpoint-fast-protection] and [l3vpn-
   egress PE-fast-protection] and mirror the inner labels (e.g.
   layer-2/3 VPN service labels) from the primary on the backup.  The
   backup would then repair the traffic to its destination based on the
   mirrored labels.  This document focuses on the methods for setting up
   the bypass LSP to the backup egress so that service specific
   mechanism could build top on this.

   In Figure 1, four LSPs require egress protection.  R6 and R8 are the
   primary egresses.  R7 is backup egress for both R6 and R8.  R5 is the
   penultimate hop node.  R5 establishes a bypass LSP to R7 to provide
   fast protection in case R6 or R8 fail.  Table 1 shows the bypass LSPs
   for each of the protected LSPs at R5.

                                  Table 1

   This draft describes two methods for setting up the bypass LSP to the
   backup egress node, the proxy node method and the alias method.

   In the proxy method, an LSP endpoint address is represented as a
   virtual node in the TE domain, attached to the primary egress node
   and the backup egress node via bidirectional point-to-point TE links.

                   [R1]                       [R8]
                       \                     /
                  [R2]---[R3]----[R4]-----[R5]---[R6]---[x]

                 x: Tunnel destination addresses in the proxy method.

                                 Figure 2

   With the proxy method, when providing egress protection to the LSPs
   with destination address x, terminating on primary R6, with backup
   egress R7, from Figure 1, the topology is modeled as shown in
   Figure 2.

   With this representation, penultimate-hop node R5 could use RFC 4090
   RSVP fast-reroute PLR procedures to set up a bypass LSP to the backup
   egress node R7, by avoiding the primary egress node R6.

   In alias method, an LSP endpoint address is associated with a primary
   egress and a explicit backup egress.  The penultimate-hop node of the
   protected LSP may learn the backup for the LSP from backup egress IGP
   advertisement or by a local configuration.  With this method, the
   penultimate-hop node can set up a bypass LSP to the backup egress
   node, by avoiding the primary egress node.

   In Figure 3, let say x is tunnel destination address and R6 advertise
   x as secondary loopback address.  With this alias representation R5
   see the x as x{R6,R7} where R6 is primary and R7 is backup for x.
   This primary to backup mapping is either learn through R7's IGP
   backup availability advertisement or by a local configuration in R5.

4.  Proxy method

   In this method, an LSP endpoint address is represented as a virtual
   TE node connected to a primary egress node and a backup egress node
   with bidirectional TE links, as shown in Figure 2.  With this model,
   node protection establishment and bypass LSP path computation on the
   penultimate hop of an LSP can follow the procedure described in
   RFC4090.

4.1.  Tunnel destination Advertisement in IGP

   Advertising the tunnel destination as a stub proxy TE node requires
   two steps: 1) a node representation (proxy-node) and 2)links to and
   from primary egress and backup egress.

   The primary advertises a proxy node with two links, to the primary
   egress and the backup egress, respectively.  The router ID of the
   proxy node is LSP end point address.  The system-ID of the proxy is
   derived from the LSP end point address with BCD encoding.  The
   resulting system-ID and router-ID MUST be unique within the IGP
   routing domain.

   Both stub links are advertised with maximum routable metric and TE
   metric, and zero bandwidth, as shown in Figure 4.  This avoids the
   proxy node serving as a transit node for any path.  The router-ID or
   system-ID of the backup egress can be dynamically learned from the
   IGP link state database or can be configured on the primary egress.

   node, with metric 1, TE metric 1, and maximum bandwidth.  It may be
   necessary for the primary node to have the capabilities to advertise
   multiple TE unnumbered transit links between primary node and proxy-
   node.  The upper bound on the number of such links is the number of
   the links the primary node advertises into TE.

   The backup egress advertises an unnumbered transit link to the proxy
   node, with MAX metric, MAX TE metric, and zero bandwidth.  Other TE
   characteristic of the links can be configured and advertised as well.

4.1.1.  IS-IS proxy-node (Non-Normative)

   When IS-IS is used as IGP to advertise the proxy node, only zeroth
   fragment of the proxy-node advertisement is valid.  All other
   fragments SHOULD be ignored.  The zeroth fragment MUST include the
   area address TLV and MAY include the hostname TLV.

   The set of area addresses advertised in proxy node zeroth fragment
   link-state PDU MUST be a subset of Area Addresses advertised by the
   primary egress in the zeroth fragment of the link-state PDU of the
   corresponding IS-IS level.  The advertisement SHOULD be syntactically
   identical to the primary egress zeroth fragment at corresponding
   IS-IS level.  The hostname SHOULD be set as <tunnel-destination +
   primary egress hostname>.

   The Overload (OL) MUST be set to 1.  The Attached (ATT), and
   Partition Repair (P) bits MUST be set to 0.

4.1.2.  OSPF proxy-node (Non-Normative)

   The advertising router and Link State ID of router LSA MUST be LSP
   end point address.  All options bits in router LSA MUST be set to
   zero.

4.2.  Ingress Node Behavior

   The ingress node of an LSP requesting egress protection SHOULD follow
   the procedures described in RFC 2205 and RFC 4090 to signal the LSP.
   In particular, it SHOULD set the destination to the endpoint address
   (i.e. the proxy node), and the "link protection desired" flag and the
   "node protection desired" flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object of the
   Path message.  In path computation, it MAY optionally exclude MAX
   metric links to avoid the link between the backup egress and the
   proxy node.

Internet-Draft     RSVP-TE LSP egress fast-protection           Nov 2013


4.3.  Primary Egress Node Behavior

   When the primary egress node receives a Path message for the LSP with
   destination matching the proxy node address, it MUST append two
   entities in the RRO object of Resv message: 1) the proxy node as a
   virtual downstream node, and 2) itself as a virtual transit node.
   The entity for the proxy node is encoded as {proxy node address,
   proxy link ID, implicit NULL}.

4.4.  Penultimate Hop Node

   When the penultimate hop node receives a Resv message from the
   primary egress, it sees itself as two hops away from LSP's
   destination rather than one hop, based on the RRO.  Thus, it can set
   up node protection for the LSP by following the procedure described
   in RFC 4090.  It SHOULD set up a bypass LSP to the backup egress
   node.  When computing a path for the bypass LSP, it SHOULD avoid the
   primary egress node and choose a path via the backup egress node to
   reach the proxy node.

4.4.1.  Backup LSP Signaling during Local Repair

   The penultimate hop node SHOULD uses the same procedure as defined
   RFC4090 to signal the backup Path, in the event of failure of the
   primary egress node.

4.5.  Backup Egress Node Behavior

   When the backup egress node receives Path message of the bypass LSP,
   it MUST terminate the Path message based on match between the LSP
   destination and the proxy node address.  It SHOULD assign a non-
   reserved label to the bypass LSP.  This non-reserved label provide
   forwarding context during repair.

4.5.1.  Backup LSP Signaling during Local Repair

   During local repair, the backup egress node will receive Path message
   of egress-protected LSP from the penultimate hop node.  The backup
   egress node SHOULD terminate the Path message, and respond with a
   Resv message.

4.6.  Proxy method solution characteristics

   The biggest advantage of the proxy method is that it does not require
   protocol extensions and can be implemented locally at the tunnel
   egress node.  Thus, no software upgrades are required in the core of
   the network.

Internet-Draft     RSVP-TE LSP egress fast-protection           Nov 2013


   The proxy method has the following caveats:

   1.  To support TE constrains like colors and SRLG for a protected LSP
       the primary needs to have the capability to advertise multiple
       links to between proxy and primary.

   2.  Bypass LSP with constrains cannot be supported.

   3.  If IS-IS is used as the IGP then the Primary node should not be
       configured with overload bit.

   4.  Backup egress could be used as primary end point in the
       forwarding plane if the protected LSP established to backup
       instead of primary in transient condition.

   Due to its characteristics, the proxy method is suitable for mixed
   environments, where an upgrade of the entire network is not feasible.


5.  Alias  model

   In this model Penultimate hop node (PHN) of a protected LSP
   understands that LSP end point has a backup egress and it could
   repair traffic carried in the protected LSP in the event of primary
   egress failure.  After the primary egress failure, the PHN reroutes
   traffic using a bypass tunnel to backup egress.  The tunnel endpoint
   address and backup egress mapping could be configured in penultimate
   hop node or signaled through IGP from the backup.  Table 2
   illustrates the PHN mapping primary to backup mapping for the
   topology in Figure 1.

5.1.  Ingress Behavior

   The ingress should follow the procedure in RFC 3209 with tunnel
   endpoint address.  The path computation could use the tunnel endpoint
   address advertised using the procedures of RFC 5786.

5.2.  Primary Egress node

   Primary egress node advertises tunnel end points that require
   protection using RFC 5786 in OSPF and/or IP interface addresses
   TLV(132) in IS-IS.  These TLVs are defined as Local address
   advertisement in TE.  The rest of the behavior is same RFC 4090.

5.3.  Backup egress node

   When backup receives a Path message not through a bypass tunnel for a
   destination address it protects with ERO constrains only one self sub
   objects then it MUST accept and respond with RRO objects in Resv
   message.  The RRO object {node ID, Ip address, label} for tunnel end
   address set with {Node ID, tunnel endpoint address, non-reserved
   label}.  This non-reserved label provide forwarding context during
   local repair.

5.3.1.  Procedures for the Backup egress during Local Repair

   The Backup egress sends Resv, ResvTear, and PathErr messages by
   sending them directly to the address in the RSVP_HOP object, as
   specified in [RSVP-TE].

5.3.2.  Processing Backup Tunnel's ERO

   When backup receive Path message through a bypass tunnel with one
   sub-object for destination address it protects then it should accept
   ERO.

5.4.  Penultimate hop node

   PLR learns/configured backup egress for tunnel a end point address
   advertised by primary egress.  When PLR setup bypass for node
   protection LSP it will also lookup for the backup egress if PLR is
   penultimate hop of the LSP.  If backup egress is available for LSP
   tunnel end point address then it setup bypass-LSP to backup egress if
   it is not setup already.  The constrains will be exclude egress node.
   PHN could setup bypass-LSP with destination as backup egress node or
   tunnel endpoint address.  If the bypass tunnel endpoint address is
   not the protected LSP tunnel endpoint then it also initiates backup
   LSP for tunnel end point address through bypass tunnel to learn the
   label to use in failure.

5.4.1.  Signaling a Backup Path

   PHP SHALL uses the same procedure as defined RFC4090 to signal the
   backup Path.

5.4.2.  Procedures for Backup Path Computation

   PLR has to find the desired explicit route for the backup path.  This
   can be done using a CSPF computation.  If PLR is PHN for the
   protected LSP needs node protection then destination for the backup
   path MUST be backup egress router ID with the constraint that the LSP
   cannot traverse the primary egress node and/or link whose failure is
   being protected against.  For other constrains SHOULD follow RFC4090.

5.4.3.  Signaling for Facility Protection

   A PHN use one or more bypass tunnels to protect against the failure
   of a egress primary node.  This bypass tunnels set up in advance or
   dynamically created as new protected LSPs are signaled.

5.4.3.1.  Discovering Downstream Labels

   To support facility backup, the PHN must determine the label that
   will indicate to the backup egress that packets received with that
   label should be processed by primary egress context.  This can be
   done by setting up the UHP bypass tunnel to the backup egress with
   tunnel endpoint address as destination.

5.4.3.2.  Processing Backup Tunnel's ERO

   Sub-objects belonging to abstract nodes that precede the tunnel
   endpoint Point are removed.  A sub-object identifying the Backup
   Tunnel destination is then added.

5.4.3.3.  PLR Procedures during Local Repair

   PHN SHALL uses the procedures defined in RFC4090 during the local
   repair.

5.5.  Alias method solution characterization

   The alias method will work with arbitrary TE constraints and suitable
   for networks that required LSP with those TE constraints.  To avoid
   PLR static backup egress configuration, IGP extension is required.


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations discussed in RFC 5036, RFC 5331, RFC
   3209, and RFC 4090 apply to this document.
