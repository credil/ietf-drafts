                  Codec Operation Point RTCP Extension
            draft-westerlund-avtext-codec-operation-point-01

Abstract

   The Audio-visual Profile with Feedback (AVPF) specification defines a
   framework and messages for fast feedback and media control over RTCP.
   The Codec Control Messages (CCM) specification defines an extension
   to AVPF, by specifying additional messages for codec control and
   feedback.  This specification extends CCM, by specifying messages
   that let participants dynamically communicate a set of codec
   configuration parameters, which enables better optimization of
   resource efficiency and quality of media transmission.

1.  Introduction

   Multimedia real-time communication services, such as video telephony
   and videoconferencing, use the real-time transport (RTP/RTCP)
   [RFC3550] protocol to transmit media streams, such as audio and
   video.  A session establishment protocol, such as SIP [RFC3261], in
   combination with a capability negotiation protocol, such as SDP
   offer/answer [RFC3264] is normally used to establish the session and
   negotiate media capabilities.  In some cases, a set of codec
   parameters is negotiated that does not express any specific limit or
   capability, but just describes a certain codec configuration.

   During session establishment, the participating endpoints normally
   have limited knowledge about the session environment, e.g. whether
   the session will be point-to-point or contain some multiparty
   scenario, how users will interact with the application, how network
   conditions will vary during the session, etc.  To take those
   variations into account, the participants can renegotiate session
   parameters to better suit the communication environment.  At times,
   when variations or changes are frequent in nature, it will require
   the needed reaction time to be short, which may make repeated session
   renegotiation inefficient and/or too slow.  In addition, variations
   may not even affect negotiated session parameters, if the variations
   occur within the negotiated boundaries.

   The above scenario can become critical especially in cases where a
   given media stream is transmitted towards, and received by, multiple
   receivers.  In multiparty environments, scalable encoding or
   simulcast can be used to make the system more efficient and provide
   better quality to participants that are capable of receiving and
   utilizing the higher quality.  These use cases result in that a
   sending party is requested to deliver multiple encoder operation
   points.

   The Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback (AVPF) specification [RFC4585]
   defines a framework and messages for fast feedback and media control
   over RTCP.  The Codec Control Messages (CCM) specification [RFC5104]
   defines an extension to AVPF, by specifying additional messages for
   codec control and feedback.  This specification extends CCM, by
   specifying messages that let participants dynamically communicate a
   set of codec configuration parameters, which enable better
   optimization of resource usage and quality of media transmission.

   The codec configuration parameters specified in this document focus
   on some basic audio and video properties, such as video resolution,
   video frame rate, media stream bit-rate, audio sampling rate, number
   of audio channels, maximum RTP packet size and rate.  Additional
   parameters can be standardized in the future.

   The codec control messages are not meant to replace the configuration
   performed using e.g.  SDP.  Instead, the messages can be used to
   communicate dynamic and frequent changes that take place within
   boundaries that have been negotiated as part of the session
   establishment.


2.  Definitions

2.1.  Terminology

   The following terms and abbreviations are used in this document:

   Bandwidth:  The network resource needed to transport a certain
      bitrate and any transport overhead, measured in bits per second.
      There will be spare network bandwidth when the (media) data
      bitrate and overhead is less than the available bandwidth.
      Similarly, data will have to be buffered when the available
      bandwidth excluding transport overhead is less than the bitrate
      used by the sender, or the excess data will be lost.  The
      available bandwidth typically varies dynamically over time.

   Bitrate:  The amount of (media) data transmitted per time unit,
      measured in bits per second, utilizing some amount of the
      available network bandwidth resource.  In the context of this
      specification and unless otherwise specified, it excludes IP/UDP/
      RTP overhead.  Depending on the (media) data source, the bitrate
      can either be constant or vary dynamically over time.

   Codec Configuration Parameter:  The configurable value describing a
      certain codec property, which may impact user-perceived media
      fidelity, encoded media stream characteristics, or both.  The
      parameter has a type (codec parameter type, see below) and a
      value, where the type describes what kind of codec property is
      controlled, and the value describes the property setting as well
      as how the value should be used in comparison operations.  A
      single parameter value can express one specific value or an open-
      ended range.  A pair of parameter values with different comparison
      types can describe a value range.  Such value range can also be
      combined with a third, target value within that range.

   Codec Operation Point:  Also denoted just operation point.  A set of
      codec configuration parameter values, describing the
      characteristics of one single encoding.  For scalable encoding, it
      describes the resulting characteristics from combining a set of
      dependent sub-streams.

Internet-Draft                     COP                      October 2012


   Codec Parameter Type:  The specific type of a codec configuration
      parameter.  Each parameter type defines what unit the value has.
      This specification defines a number of generally useful parameter
      types in Section 8 that can be used to control codec operation.

   Encoding:  A particular encoding is the resulting media stream from
      applying a certain choice of codec configuration parameters to the
      encoder.  The media stream will have a certain fidelity (quality)
      from that encoding through the choice of sampling, bit-rate and
      other configuration parameters.

   Endpoint:  A host or node that has a presence in the RTP session with
      one or more Synchronization Sources (SSRC)s.

   Mixer:  An RTP session centralized node that generates media streams
      based on incoming media streams from other endpoints.  See Topo-
      Mixer in RTP Topologies [RFC5117].

   RTP Session:  An association among a set of participants
      communicating with RTP.  The distinguishing feature of an RTP
      session (defined in [RFC3550]) is that each RTP session maintains
      a full, separate space of SSRC identifiers.  Each participant in
      the RTP session can see SSRC or CSRC identifiers from the other
      participants, either by RTP, RTCP, or both.

   Sub-Stream:  An individually decodeable part of a scalable media
      stream, including all dependent sub-streams.  The characteristics
      of a certain sub-stream can be described by a codec operation
      point.

   Translator:  An RTP session centralized node that forwards all media
      streams from other endpoints, modified to some extent, e.g.
      addressing, encoding, fidelity.  See Topo-Translator in RTP
      Topologies [RFC5117].

3.  Motivation

3.1.  Problem Description

   Networks can contain endpoints with different capabilities, including
   CPU power, capture and render device fidelity (e.g. image
   resolution), and codecs.  In addition, the characteristics and
   properties of networks can vary, which endpoints have to cope with.
   For example, in videoconferencing and telepresence services, a large

   number of endpoints may participate, and there may be a large number
   of media streams associated with the session.  Such multiparty
   scenarios typically use entities for media mixing, switching and
   transcoding.  The aim is to provide the best possible quality to each
   endpoint, taking endpoint and network capabilities into
   consideration.

   Many communication services today use codecs that can be configured
   in a number of different ways.  Often, the codecs have multiple
   properties that can be configured and those properties may also be
   inter-related, often in complex ways.  One example is the H.264 (AVC)
   [H264] video codec and its scalable (SVC) and multiview (MVC)
   versions.  Most other video codecs, and codecs for many other types
   of media, also have multiple configurable properties.  Such
   configurable properties will be referred to as "codec configuration
   parameters" in this specification.

   There can be several reasons to change the media rate or other
   encoding or packetization properties during an ongoing communication
   session.  Reasons can be that the available network bandwidth varies,
   or that other network properties change, such as effective MTU or
   packet rate limitations.  Other reasons can be that the quality or
   representation of the media rendered to the end user changes, maybe
   as a direct result of the user manipulating the GUI (e.g. changing
   window position or size), or the relative importance of the received
   media stream changes (e.g. active or non-active speaker in a
   conferencing scenario), or the user selects to show some other
   content source that is available among the advertised media streams.

   The codec changes above can be made directly between endpoints in a
   point-to-point scenario, or they may involve, and be acted upon, by
   media aware intermediaries (e.g.  RTP mixers).  An RTP mixer can do
   transcoding to provide each receiver with media streams of adapted
   quality, but transcoding has drawbacks as it always consumes
   processing power, typically impacts media quality in a negative way,
   and often introduces additional delays.

   In order to avoid separate transcoding towards each endpoint, an RTP
   mixer can, by taking the capabilities of the endpoints into account,
   decide to request specific codec configurations from sending
   endpoints, which will minimize the need for transcoding.  Also, in
   scenarios where no RTP mixers are used and transmitted media reaches
   multiple endpoints, the sender will have to take into account that
   each endpoint may have different capabilities.  The use cases section
   (Section 4) shows different use cases, with and without RTP mixers.

   Resource optimization involving bandwidth is expected to be one of
   the major reasons for changing encoding properties, since it is

   desirable to avoid using more bandwidth than absolutely necessary,
   especially considering that

   o  the expectation for high media quality will continue to increase;

   o  the bitrate required to transmit the media, despite increasingly
      efficient media coding, can due to the above also be expected to
      increase;

   o  the available bandwidth is commonly a scarce and/or costly
      resource and will continue to be in the future;

   o  the relation between media bitrate and media codec configuration,
      the used set of media codec property values, is typically complex
      and the mapping between each individual codec property and bitrate
      is not linear;

   o  the used media bitrate does not uniquely identify the media codec
      configuration, but there are multiple codec configurations that
      can generate the same media bitrate;

   o  the media receiver preferences how the codec property values
      should be set for a certain media bitrate will vary with the
      specific end-user service requirements (for example, but not
      limited to, users with special needs) and the current media stream
      role in the application;

   o  the communication scenarios will not be limited to point-to-point,
      potentially involving multiple and at least partly conflicting
      constraints from different receivers.

   Other resources that may be desirable to optimize include, but not
   limited to, endpoint and middle node processing (CPU) utilization,
   and transport quality (QoS).

   A media receiver cannot be assumed to know exactly what codec
   configuration will be best for the media sender to use, given that
   the sender needs to take multiple aspects into account, including
   implementation limitations in the actual encoder.  It should be more
   likely to find a value acceptable to both sender and receiver if the
   receiver can indicate an acceptable range instead of just a single
   value.

   When an RTP mixer distributes streams to multiple receivers with
   different media quality requirements, it is sometimes possible to
   avoid targeted transcoding for every single receiver.  That can be
   accomplished if the media sender has the ability to produce multiple
   media versions, such as for example scalable encoding or simulcast.

   Thus, there is a need to both address specific media versions and
   describe the fact that multiple media versions with different
   configurations should be used.

3.2.  Legacy Methods

3.2.1.  Relation to SDP

   The session description protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] is commonly used to
   negotiate and configure codecs, as well as to establish RTP/RTCP
   session parameters during session establishment and ongoing sessions,
   e.g. by using it in conjunction with SIP [RFC3261] and SDP Offer/
   Answer [RFC3264].

   As described in Section 3.1, many of the underlying reasons which
   make media receivers desire certain codec encoding properties are
   highly dynamic in nature and using SIP/SDP to renegotiate the session
   will in many cases be too slow to be useful.  SIP messages containing
   an SDP may become quite large for sessions containing many media
   types, and since there is no defined way to send a partial SDP, even
   very small changes require sending the entire SDP.  Most of the
   current defined properties in SDP are oriented to be common for all
   media streams in the same RTP session, at least the ones sharing the
   same RTP Payload Type, rather than being specific to one media stream
   (e.g. "a=fmtp:98 profile-level-id=42C00C").

   The mechanism in this specification does not replace SDP, or the SDP
   Offer/Answer mechanism.  It is expected that SDP is used in order to
   negotiate and configure boundary values for codec properties, and COP
   can then be used to communicate specific values within those
   boundaries, as long as there is no impact on the values negotiated
   using SDP.  It is possible to establish communication sessions even
   if one or more endpoints do not support COP.

3.2.2.  Relation to RTCP

   As discussed in CCM, regular RTCP reporting or extended reports
   [RFC3611] can to some extent be used to reconfigure an encoder, but
   the reported measures seldom map directly back to encoding properties
   and they typically cannot express an unwanted situation in terms of
   encoding properties and what the receiver would like to receive
   instead.  Communicating codec properties indirectly as a set of
   network properties will require interpretation by both sender and
   receiver and will thus risk misinterpretations and ambiguity.  Since
   it is likely that a decoder is able to identify unwanted
   characteristics of the media stream in terms of encoding properties,
   the most straight forward approach is to convey those properties
   directly to the encoder.

   Responsive techniques to control encoding are already available, e.g.
   Codec Control Messages (CCM) [RFC5104].  Although highly applicable,
   the possibilities to control encoding is however not explicit enough,
   both in terms of the amount of available parameters to control, and
   the fact that they may be inter-related, alternative, or both.

   Some codecs define codec-specific methods to enable receiver control
   of some encoding aspects, but it should be beneficial for
   interoperability to use codec agnostic signaling instead.


4.  Use Cases for COP

   This section discusses a number of use cases for codec operation
   points.

4.1.  Point to Point

   This set of use cases focuses on communication, which is directly
   point to point between a media sender and a receiver.  There is no
   need for further forwarding of the media streams.  Thus, the goal
   should be to produce a media stream, transport it to the media
   receiver, where it is consumed as optimal as possible for the
   application.  Thanks to this one-to-one mapping between encoder and
   decoder, great flexibility exists to produce a media stream tailored
   to the receiver's needs, given the constraints that exist from media
   sender, transport network and the receiver.

   Some constraints are static (and thus suitable for session
   configuration signalling), but others are highly dynamical and
   desirable to adapt to during the session:

   Video Resolution in GUI:  In a video communication application,
      including WebRTC based ones, the window where the media senders
      media stream is presented may change, for example due to the user
      modifying the size of the window.  It might also be due to other
      application related actions, like selecting to show a
      collaborative work space and thus reducing the area used to show
      the remote video.  In both of these cases it is the receiver side
      that knows how big the actual screen area is and what the most
      suitable resolution would be.  It appears suitable to let the
      receiver request the media sender to send a media stream
      conforming to the displayed video size.

   Network Bit-rate Limitations:  If the receiver discovers a network
      bandwidth limitation, it can choose to meet it by requesting media
      stream bit-rate limitations.  Especially in cases where a media
      sender provides multiple media streams, the relative distribution

      of available bit-rate can help the application to provide the most
      suitable experience in a constrained situation.

   CPU Constraint:  A media receiver may become constrained in the
      amount of available processing resources.  This may occur in the
      middle of a session for example due to the user selecting a power
      saving mode, or starting additional applications requiring
      resources.  When this occurs, the receiving application can select
      which and how much to constrain codec parameters to best suit the
      needs of the application.  For example, if lower framerate is a
      better constraint than lower resolution.

4.2.  Media Receiver to RTP Mixer

   This section considers a multiparty session with a centralized media
   intermediary, like an RTP mixer, where the media receiver uses COP to
   affect the delivered media.

                              +------------+        +---+

         Figure 1: Receiver (B) using COP to adapt a media stream

   In the above Figure 1 we focus on the possible usages of COP by a
   media receiver, like B. Here the functional role of the intermediary
   becomes important (Topo-Mixer) [RFC5117].  An RTP mixer uses its own
   SSRC(s) to channel selected media streams to B from other
   participants like A. If the intermediary is instead a translator, the
   Receiver B can see A's SSRC(s) directly instead of possibly showing
   up as CSRC.  We will in this section focus on the mixer case.  The
   RTP translator case is further discussed in Section 4.4.

   The RTP mixer's usage of its own SSRC allows mixer to receiver media
   flows to be associated with a role or purpose in the application
   rather than a given media source.  Based on the assumption that the
   set of available stream roles are connected to the specific use case
   or application, it is likely that the set of stream roles (for
   example most active speaker) provided from a mixer will change less
   often than the original media source representing that role is

   changed.  It is further assumed that the desirable media
   characteristics related to a specific role will be fairly constant.
   To minimize the amount of signaling needed to modify stream
   characteristics, it could thus be appropriate to let a stream
   represent a role rather than limiting it to represent the original
   source.  When there exist multiple RTP streams from the mixer to a
   receiver, the receiver can use COP to request an operations point
   that better suits the receiver's needs on each particular stream
   (role) of the media stream.  COP also allows the receiver to select
   its desired trade-off in properties and quality between multiple
   delivered media streams.

   There exist different reasons why B would need to indicate changes in
   its capabilities to receive a particular media stream:

   Network Path:  The receiver detects changes in the network that on a
      mid to long term will result in a new capability regarding the
      maximum bit-rate that can be supported.

   Bandwidth Trade-off:  In an application receiving multiple media
      streams, if the receiving application likes to change the relative
      bit-rate trade-off between the streams.

   Presentation or GUI Changes:  If the presentation or graphical user
      interface (GUI) changes on the receiving side this results in
      other requirements or needs on the media streams.  For example if
      the application window is resized by the user, the amount of
      screen estate to present the different video elements changes.  To
      optimize the video quality in relation to bit-rate the receiver
      indicates the new preferred video resolution.

   In all the above cases the receiver sends a COP request to the mixer
   for new codec operation points on mixer controlled media stream(s).
   It then becomes the mixer's responsibility to determine if and how
   the requested COPs can be supported.  For example by requesting new
   operations points from the media source as discussed in Section 4.3.
   The selection of another media source to deliver in a media stream
   can result in that the mixer may have to update the receiver on the
   properties of the operations point.

4.3.  RTP Mixer to Media Sender

   This section looks at the usage of COP in cases of multiparty with
   centralized media intermediary, like an RTP mixer, selecting and
   requesting tailored media stream or streams a media sender delivers
   to the intermediary for further forwarding or manipulation.  This
   usage can be simplified to the media streams from one media sender
   (A), which is currently being delivered to multiple receivers (B-D)

       Figure 2: Mixer using COP to adapt media streams to multiple
                                 receivers

   The media path from the mixer to B, C and D are different and thus
   the available resources may vary between them.  In addition B, C and
   D may have different capabilities when it comes to handling media
   streams.  These limitations can be learned by the mixer through
   session configuration signalling, media transmission feedback (e.g.
   RTCP), or usage of COP by the receivers (See Section 4.2).
   Limitations are also expected to be updated during the session
   lifetime.

   The media sender (A) has certain capabilities and what is possible to
   do will depend on A's capabilities and what has been configured
   between A and the mixer.  Let's consider different capabilities of A
   and how they influence the usage of COP to affect the media stream(s)
   delivered to the mixer.

   Single Media Encoding:  If A can only provide a single media encoding
      of a particular media source, the mixer has to make a choice on
      what property it would like to request for that media stream.  The
      most basic choice is to request the lowest common denominator
      across the receiver population.  If the mixer has certain
      capabilities for media transcoding it could select to request
      another operation point for the media encoding with higher quality
      and then transcode to some few receivers.  That enables a higher
      quality to several receivers while still being able to serve
      endpoints with the least capabilities.  In these cases the mixer
      has to send COP requests that indicate only a single operation
      point with parameters matching the restrictions in the best
      possible way.

Internet-Draft                     COP                      October 2012


   Scalable Media Encoding:  If A is capable of producing a scalable
      media stream encoding, the mixer can request multiple operation
      points for the same media stream.  For example, if A is capable of
      producing three different operation points, the mixer in the above
      Figure 2 would be able to request scalability layers that match
      the capabilities of all three receivers B, C and D. If several
      receivers have similar capabilities, the mixer may choose to
      request fewer operation points.  In this case, other than in the
      single media encoding, the mixer must determine which packets or
      parts of packets to send to each receiver based on their
      capabilities.  This requires that the mixer is capable of
      identifying in the media stream which scalability layer matches a
      requested operation point.  Thus, it is desirable that the media
      sender can indicate to the mixer which layer matches a given
      operation point.

   Simulcast Media:  If A and the mixer have negotiated the usage of
      simulcasted media encoding of the media source, then the mixer can
      adopt several operation points to best suit the receivers, just
      like for scalable encoding.  When simulcasting, the mixer will
      however have to send one COP request per media stream it actually
      wants to affect.  It is necessary to ensure that configuration
      changes over multiple media streams from the same media source
      take place.  Compared to scalable media, the mixer does not need
      not strip away layers to match a particular operation point but
      can forward entirely self-contained media streams.

   The use of COP as described above can be triggered by a multitude of
   reasons.  We will here discuss some of them.  We already mentioned
   that bit-rate adaptation (congestion control) on the mixer to
   receiver path can indicate a need to change an operation point.
   Another reason is when a new session participant joins that has
   certain receiver capabilities (both decoding or other hardware, as
   well as network path related), thus potentially changing the optimal
   set of operation points.  There also exist a number of different
   cases where the desired application behavior results in changes in
   desired operation points, like change of active speakers,
   reconfiguration of the display layout, etc.

   It is important to remember that Figure 2 only presents the view of a
   single media sender.  In most communication sessions there are
   multiple media senders, and the mixer will need to take the
   combination of media streams from multiple media senders into account
   when choosing what is to be sent to a given receiver.  Thus changes
   at one media sender can result in related changes of the operation
   points at the other media senders.

4.4.  Media Receiver in Multicast or with RTP Transport Translator

   This section covers the usage of COP in multicast transported RTP
   sessions, as well as when transport translators (Topo-Translator)
   [RFC5117] are used.  Transport translators can be used to emulate any
   source multicast (ASM) over unicast.  Multicast usages also include
   Source Specific Multicast (SSM) [RFC4607], which according to "RTP
   Control Protocol (RTCP) Extensions for Single-Source Multicast
   Sessions with Unicast Feedback" [RFC5760] has two main modes: simple
   mode, and summary feedback mode.  SSM modes affect the usage of COP
   functionalities.

   any incoming packets to all the other session participants, emulates
   an ASM session (see Figure 3).  As anyone can send to all other in
   both cases, there are some properties in these large scale sessions
   with many participants which require extra consideration.

                      Figure 4: SSM based RTP session

   In the above Figure 4, the media senders (MS1 ...  MSm) send their
   media streams and RTCP traffic to the distribution source (DS).  The
   DS forwards the RTP and RTCP traffic from the media senders to the
   SSM group.  Using the RTCP extension for unicast RTCP feedback
   [RFC5760], the receivers (R1...Rn) send their RTCP traffic to their
   configured feedback target.  This sample session has two feedback
   targets to scale with the amount of receivers.  RTCP messages that
   need to go to a media sender are forwarded to the FT aggregator part
   of the distribution source for further forwarding over the unicast
   paths between the distribution source and the media senders.  The
   feedback target and the feedback aggregator also forward all RTCP
   messages from receivers in simple mode, and aggregate it in summary
   mode.  Some RTCP messages from a receiver may still have to be
   forwarded over the SSM group.

   multiparty topologies described above and it is important that COP
   does not cause significant issues in any of the environments.

   In the basic case, where only a single multicast group exists, there
   is a well known problem associated with adapting content and bit-rate
   to the receiver population.  The more receivers, the larger the
   potential for non-matching requirements in requests from the
   different receivers.  One strategy for meeting this is to use the
   lowest common denominator among the requests from the receiver
   population.  This normally results in sub-optimal quality for a
   significant part of the session participants, the main benefit being
   that all participants will be able to receive some content.

   Because of the above limitations of operation within a single group,
   the usage of COP in larger groups becomes difficult unless the
   parameters that can be adopted and affected by COP requests are such
   that a limited set of participants is expected to request them, and
   the impact for the others are limited or acceptable.  The authors
   therefore expects the usage of COP in large groups to be limited and
   this specification focuses on operation in smaller groups.  However,
   as it is not possible to define the threshold when a group changes
   from being small to be too large to work well with COP in the generic
   case, it is important that COP can operate safely in a large group,
   although the possibilities to satisfy the request may be severely
   limited.

   There also exist use cases for COP where the media application uses
   multiple multicast groups to enable multiple operation points and
   allows each receiver to join the multicast groups that suits the
   participant's capabilities.  An example of such usage would be
   Scalable Video Coding (SVC) using the Multi-Session Transport (MST)
   mode of the SVC RTP payload format [RFC6190].  The SVC MST RTP
   streams that are sent in each group can still contain multiple
   scalability layers.  One could combine coarse-grained control on the
   operation points by having the receiver join a particular session
   with a more fine-grained control using COP to adjust the included
   scalability layers to the receiver's needs, such as lower CPU load.


5.  Requirements

   The solution outlined in this specification should fulfill the
   following requirements:

   REQ-1:  Enable dynamic control of possibly inter-related codec
      properties during an ongoing media session.

   REQ-2:  Be media type agnostic, to the furthest extent possible, and
      at least cover audio and video media.

   REQ-3:  Be codec agnostic (within the same media type), to the
      furthest extent possible.

   REQ-4:  Work with different media transmission types, i.e. single-
      stream, simulcast, single-stream scalable, and multi-stream
      scalable transmission.

   REQ-5:  Work with un-encrypted as well as encrypted media.

   REQ-6:  Be extensible, making it simple to add control and
      description of new codec properties.

   REQ-7:  Complement rather than conflict with other codec
      configuration methods such as other RTCP based techniques and SDP.

   REQ-8:  Support configurable parameters that are directly visible in
      the media stream as well as those that are not visible in the
      media stream.

   In addition, Guidelines for Extending RTCP [RFC5968] should be
   followed.


6.  Solution Overview

   The mechanism described in this specification especially targets
   heterogeneous multiparty scenarios where different endpoints require
   differently encoded media from the same source, but its use in other
   situations is not precluded.  In fact, point-to-point scenarios are
   considered to be of equal importance but not more demanding that the
   multiparty case.  In the targeted scenario, the media stream from one
   encoder is sent to multiple decoders.  Hence, the encoder must
   possibly provide an encoding with multiple operation points, suitable
   for the receivers.  This is only possible with so-called scalable
   codecs, but some codecs may have inherent scalability features
   without being generally considered as scalable (e.g.  H.264/AVC
   temporal scalability through non-reference frames).  Multiparty
   services often involve a media mixer (Topo-Mixer) [RFC5117] as a
   central network node.

   The solution defined in this specification is targeted for automatic
   control of codec parameters, not as a direct result of user
   interaction, although the automatic control can in turn be triggered
   by user interaction.  It can be used during an active session to
   quickly adapt to changes in media receiver available bandwidth and/or
   preferences for one or more codec properties, while still conforming
   to the session configuration, like SDP offer/answer negotiated
   minimum or maximum limits (depending on individual SDP property
   semantics).  Some codec property changes will also motivate to
   renegotiate the SDP, but the scope of this specification intends to
   cover only changes that lie within the SDP negotiated set and thus do
   not impact the SDP.

   Three message types are defined to support the solution: a request, a
   notification, and a status report:

   Request (COPR):  A media receiver requesting a media sender to adjust
      one or more of it's media encoding parameters for a media stream.
      The request is normally based on a specific set of media encoding
      parameters that the media sender has explicitly notified the media
      receiver about in a notification.

   Notification (COPN):  A media sender notifying a media receiver of
      the currently used media encoding parameters for a media stream.
      The notification is initiated by the media sender, typically
      whenever the media encoding parameters changed significantly from
      what was previously used.  The reason for the change can either be
      local to the media sender (user, endpoint or network), or it can
      be the result of one or more requests from remote endpoints.

   Status Report (COPA):  A media sender reporting to a request sender
      (media receiver) on request reception status, which specific
      request from the media receiver that was received and considered
      in setting current media encoding parameters, and the
      identification of the media stream that is considered to fulfill
      the request.  The status report can also indicate various error
      conditions, such as reception of invalid or failing requests.

   More details about the individual messages are found in the following
   sub-sections.

6.1.  Message Structure

   A COP message is sent from an RTP session participant in its role
   either as media receiver or media sender.  Each message can contain
   one or more message items of one or more message types, all
   originating from a single media source.

   The individual message items each relate only to a single operation
   point, describing part of an atomic notification or request.

   The general structure is outlined below:
                  +--------------------------------------+
                  | AVPF PSFB FMT="COP"                  |
                  | SSRC of Packet Sender                |
                  | SSRC of Media Source                 |
                  | +----------------------------------+ |
                  | | COP Message Item 0               | |
                  | +----------------------------------+ |
                  | | (Codec Configuration Parameters) | |
                  | +----------------------------------+ |
                  | +----------------------------------+ |
                  | | COP Message Item 1               | |
                  | +----------------------------------+ |
                  | | (Codec Configuration Parameters) | |
                  | +----------------------------------+ |
                  | ...                                  |
                  +--------------------------------------+

                      Figure 6: COP message structure

   Note that the request is the only COP message item defined in this
   specification that is sent in the media receiver role and makes use
   of "SSRC of media source" as the targeted media stream for the
   request.  Both the notification and the status report message items
   are sent in the media sender role, reporting on the message sender's
   own configuration and thus relate only to the "SSRC of packet
   sender", being agnostic to the "SSRC of media source" field.

   It is for example possible to collocate COPS and COPN messages for
   the same media source in the same COP FCI.  It is also possible to
   co-locate one or more COPR referring to a single "SSRC of media
   source" with one or more COPN and/or COPS relating to a single "SSRC
   of packet sender" within a single COP message.

   Multiple message items of the same type in the same COP message are
   used to describe a notification, status or request for a media stream
   containing multiple operation points (see Section 6.3).

   Multiple COP messages are needed to be able to refer to multiple
   different "SSRC of packet sender" and/or "SSRC of media source".

6.2.  Codec Configuration Parameter Use

   The codec configuration parameters that are applicable to a certain
   codec may be specific to the media type (audio, video, ...), and may
   also be codec specific.  Some codec properties (described by codec
   configuration parameters) have to be explicitly enabled by (non-RTCP
   based) capability signaling to be possible or permitted to use.

   An endpoint implementing this specification does not need to support
   all available codec configuration parameters defined herein or in
   extensions to this specification.  A certain parameter could be
   unnecessary for a certain codec or media stream, even if it is
   generally supported by the endpoint.  This specification therefore
   defines capability signaling that allows a COP receiver to declare
   explicit support per parameter type on a per codec level.  The set of
   codec configuration parameters that can be used for a certain media
   stream by a COP sender is thus restricted by the combination of
   applicability, capability signaling and explicit receiver parameter
   support signaling.

   Any codec configuration parameter that is applicable and feasible to
   use, but is not included as part of an operation point, has a default
   value.  This default value is defined for each parameter type, but
   should preferably whenever possible be taken from capability
   signaling.  It is not necessary to use all defined parameter types in
   a media stream description.  Some parameter types can, depending on
   media type or codec, either be unnecessary, or not possible to
   describe or control in detail, in which case they can be left out.
   This means that the effective value is "undefined" within the limits
   set by capability signaling (outside the scope of this
   specification).

6.3.  Operation Point

   The codec configuration parameters contained in a single message item
   jointly constitute a description of an operation point for a specific
   media stream from a media sender.

   For the purpose of COP signaling, each operation point is identified
   with an identity number (OPID), which is scoped by the media sender's
   RTP SSRC identification, and can be chosen freely by the media
   sender.  The need for this media sub-stream identification only
   appears with scalable coding or other media encoding methods that
   introduce separable and configurable sub-streams within the same
   SSRC.  An OPID thus refers to such configurable sub-stream, described
   by a set of related codec configuration parameters.

                           +-------------------------------------+

     Figure 7: Relation of OPID to media source, RTP session and SSRC

   Figure 7 depicts the possible relations between media sources, RTP
   sessions, RTP streams (SSRCs), RTP sub-streams, and the OPID.

   For example, a single video camera may be encoded using SVC for a
   combined SST and MST transmission configuration.  In that case a
   subset of scalability layers is sent as SST in the first RTP session
   using SSRC2.  Another set of scalability layers is transported in the
   second RTP session as another SST using SSRC3.  The RTP packet stream
   from each SSRC can thus contain several sub-streams, each identified
   with its own OPID.  As a result, a single media source is present in
   two RTP sessions, using two different SSRCs (2 and 3) containing a
   total of five sub-streams (OPID 3 to 7).

   Since an operation point is expected to change over time, as a result
   of media receiver requests (Section 6.4), resulting from local media
   sender considerations (Section 6.5), or both, the operation point
   (OPID) is version handled.  The version is scoped by SSRC and OPID.

   It is expected that all encoders dividing a media stream into sub-
   streams will include some means to identify those sub-streams in the
   media stream.  However, it is also expected that such identification
   is in general codec specific.  There is thus a need to map the codec
   agnostic COP OPID identification to codec specific identification,
   and this specification therefore includes a method for such mapping
   (Section 10).

6.4.  Request

   The request is sent by a media receiver, which can be either an
   endpoint or a middle node such as an RTP mixer.  The receiver of the
   request may similarly be either the original media sender or a RTP
   mixer.  Included in the request is a description of the desired codec
   configuration for a specific media (sub-)stream.  The parameter
   values communicated in a notification (Section 6.5) of that
   (sub-)stream are taken as a starting point when deciding what
   parameters and parameter values to choose for the request, and only
   parameters with changed values need to be included the request.  The
   media receiver can of course use other sources of information when
   choosing parameters and values, for example observation of the
   received media stream and capability signaling.

   It is not required to receive a notification beforehand to be able to
   create a meaningful request.  The request can include a set of
   changed properties for existing streams, but it can also request the
   addition or removal of one or more media sub-streams having certain
   properties, in which case there will be no notification to base the
   request on.  A media receiver may also want to send a request prior
   to having received any notifications for existing streams, and can
   then base the request on other information such as for example
   observing the media stream or use information from the capability
   signaling.  In case there is no existing stream and OPID to refer to
   in the request, a "provisional" OPID MUST be chosen in the request,
   which will have to be mapped back to an existing (sub-)stream and
   "real" OPID through methods defined in this specification
   (Section 10).

   The media sender receiving a specific request is not required to
   reconfigure the encoder accordingly, even if it should try to do so.
   The media sender is allowed to take other (previous or concurrent)
   requests and any local considerations into account, possibly
   modifying some of the parameter values, or even to reject the request
   completely if it is not seen as feasible.  It is thus not possible
   for a media receiver to uniquely see from the media stream or even
   from a notification if the media sender received the request or if
   the request was lost and needs to be resent.

   A request should be based on a notification, but there may be
   situations where a request is sent approximately simultaneously with
   a new notification for the same stream.  In that case, there is a
   risk that the request is based on the wrong set of codec properties
   compared to the new notification.  It is therefore necessary to have
   the set of codec properties version controlled, identified by an
   OPID.  If a notification announces a specific version of the
   operation point, where the version is updated every time it is
   changed, the request can refer to that specific version and any mis-
   reference can be clearly identified and resolved.  In addition, it
   allows for easy identification of repeated notifications and requests
   by checking the operation point identification and the version,
   without the need to parse through all codec properties for changes.

6.5.  Notification

   The notification is sent by a media sender and describes a media
   stream or sub-stream in terms of a defined, finite set of codec
   properties.  That same set of codec properties can also be used in a
   request (Section 6.4).  The notification and the set of defined
   properties is important to be known at the media receiver since it is
   rarely possible to see from the media stream itself what controllable
   properties were used to generate the stream.  The set of codec
   properties and their values used to describe a certain media stream
   at a certain point in time are henceforth called a codec
   configuration.  Each operation point in this codec configuration is
   implemented using an RTP payload type, defined by capability
   signaling outside the scope of this specification.

   It must be possible for a media sender to change the codec
   configuration not only based on requests from media receivers, but
   also based on local limitations, considerations, or user actions.
   This implies that the notification can be sent standalone and not
   only as a response to a request (compare TMMBR and TMMBN [RFC5104]).
   To avoid that media receivers have to guess what codec configuration
   is used, a media sender should always send a notification when the
   codec configuration for a stream changes.  Loss of a notification
   messages should not be critical since a media receiver could either
   fall back to infer the approximate codec configuration from the media
   stream itself, or simply wait with a request until the next
   notification is sent.

   A notification can potentially contain a large amount of codec
   properties.  However, parameters that are not enabled by codec and
   COP capability signaling, or inherently are not part of the used
   codec will not be included.  The notification only describes the
   currently used codec configuration, and each parameter of an
   operation point will be described by a single value.  To further

   limit the amount of properties to be sent, it is possible to rely on
   parameter defaults (listed by individual parameter type definitions)
   whenever those values are acceptable.

   The media receiver could want to take local action at the time when
   the codec configuration in the media stream changes.  Using the same
   reasoning as above, this may not be possible to see from the media
   stream itself.  This functionality is explicitly enabled by including
   the RTP time stamp in the notification, where the time stamp
   describes a time (possibly in the future) when the codec
   configuration is (estimated to be) effective.

   It is not required that a media sender sends notifications for all
   media streams or sub-streams.  However, the non-announced streams or
   sub-streams will then not be accessible to media receiver control
   (Section 6.4).  Any media or transport resources occupied by those
   non-announced streams (in COP terms) must be excluded from the total
   amount of available resources when deciding feasible parameter value
   ranges for the announced streams.

6.6.  Status Report

   The status report is sent by a media sender and is needed to confirm
   reception of a request OPID to avoid unnecessary retransmission of
   requests.  Loss of a status report will likely trigger a request
   retransmission, except when the request sender can infer from the
   media stream or a notification that the stream is now acceptable.

   The status report is not a required acknowledgement of every request,
   but instead reports on the last received request, identified by a
   request sequence number in addition to the OPID.  This decoupling of
   requests and status reports reduces the needed amount of status
   reports in case of frequently updated requests and/or lack of
   resources to send status reports.

   If a request is somehow not acceptable to a media sender, the status
   report can also indicate failure and a reason for failure.

   In case the OPID in the request is a "provisional" OPID
   (Section 6.4), the status report responds with that exact OPID, but
   also includes a reference to a "real" media (sub-)stream
   identification or OPID that the media sender considers appropriate
   for the request.

   No description of any codec configuration is included in a status
   report, even if the corresponding request was successful.  The codec
   configuration is only carried in the notification (Section 6.5)
   message.  Multiple status reports targeted for multiple request

Internet-Draft                     COP                      October 2012


   senders can through media (sub-)stream identification and OPID point
   to the same notification message, reducing the need to repeat
   applicable codec configuration parameters with every accepted
   request.

6.7.  Adding and Removing Operation Points

   A media sender can unilaterally create a new operation point by
   simply selecting a free OPID identifier and use COPN to announce it.

   To remove an operation point, the media sender simply stops
   announcing it in COPN.  This procedure can be used both for entire
   media streams containing a single operation point and to add/remove
   sub-streams in media streams containing multiple operation points.

   The media receiver can request a new operation point to be created by
   using a COPR with an unused identifier and by setting a flag to
   indicate that this requests a new OPID.  The media sender then
   decides if it honors the request or not, and announces the new OPID
   as described above.

   The media receiver can indicate that it is no longer interested in
   receiving an operation point corresponding to a media sub-stream by
   not including any COPR message item for it in a single COP message.
   The media receiver can indicate a wish to continue to receive an
   unmodified operation point using a COPR without any codec properties
   (no change).


7.  Codec Control Message Extension

   This specification specifies a new feedback message, COP, for codec
   control of real-time media, as an extension to the AVPF [RFC4585] and
   CCM [RFC5104] specifications.  The AVPF specification outlines a
   mechanism for fast feedback messages over RTCP, which is applicable
   for IP based real-time media transport and communication services.
   It defines both transport layer and payload-specific feedback
   messages.  This specification targets the payload-specific type,
   since a certain codec is typically described by a payload type.

   AVPF defines three and CCM defines four payload-specific feedback
   messages (PSFB).  All AVPF and CCM messages are identified by means
   of the feedback message type (FMT) parameter.  This specification
   specifies one additional payload-specific feedback message.

   One new PSFB FMT value is assigned in this specification:

   TBA1:   Codec Operation Point (COP)

   This section defines the feedback message structure, message items
   and their semantics with the exception of the actual codec
   configuration parameters which are defined in the next section
   (Section 8).

7.1.  COP Message

   The COP message is a payload-specific AVPF CCM message identified by
   the PSFB FMT value listed above.  It carries one or more COP message
   items, each with either a request for, a description of a certain
   "operation point"; a set of codec parameters, or a request status
   indication.

   Not all message items makes use of the "SSRC of media source" in the
   common packet header.  "SSRC of media source" SHALL be set to 0 if no
   message item that makes use of it is included in the FCI.

7.2.  FCI Format

   The COP FCI MUST contain one or more codec operation point message
   items.  The maximum number of COP message items in a COP message is
   limited by the [RFC4585] Common Packet Format 'length' field.

   The definition of the AVPF feedback message format mandates that the
   FCI part is a multiple of 32-bit words.  The below defined message
   items will not be 32-bit word aligned.  Therefore it is sometimes
   necessary to insert one to three padding bytes at the end of the FCI.
   The number of padding bytes are determined by a receiver by comparing
   the sum of the message items and the feedback message length fields.
   The padding byte MUST be set to zero (0) and ignored on reception.

      this specification.  Message items with a type field that has an
      unknown value SHALL be ignored by the receiver.

      belonging to this message, following the message item header, i.e.
      anything following the Version field.

   OPID (8 bits):  Operation point ID.  Some (typically scalable) codecs
      are capable of encoding into multiple simultaneous operation
      points using the same SSRC, and each operation point can then be
      referenced by OPID.  MUST be unique within the scope of an SSRC
      when N flag is not set.  MUST be set to 0 for message items not
      using the field.  See also Section 7.2.3.

   N (1 bit):  A "New OPID" flag, indicating that the OPID value is
      chosen arbitrarily and is not meant to refer to any existing
      operation point.  The message sender SHOULD NOT use an already
      known OPID in combination with the N flag.  See also individual
      message item definitions.

   Version (7 bits):  Referencing a specific version of the codec
      configuration identified by the OPID.

7.2.3.  Operation Point Identification

   All RTP media streams belonging to the same session can per
   definition be identified by the SSRC.  However, identification of any
   sub-streams contained in the same RTP media stream (SSRC) needs to
   use some other identification method, scoped by the SSRC.  This is
   the case for a media stream containing more than one operation point,
   like for example SVC [RFC6190] streams being sent using Single Stream
   Transport (SST) RTP packetization.

   The encoding of and restrictions for such sub-stream (operation
   point) identification will in general be codec specific.  Therefore,
   the OPID used in this specification is merely an SSRC-unique

   identification number.  It is however necessary to create a mapping
   between this generic number and the codec specific sub-stream
   identification that can be found in the media stream.  This mapping
   is achieved by including the ID parameter (Section 8.3) in a message
   item carrying a certain OPID.

   In Section 10, codec specific ID parameter formats are defined for a
   few of the most common codecs that supports scalability.

      configuration parameters.

   N (1 bit):  Not used by COPN and SHALL be set to 0 by senders.

   Version (7 bits):  Referencing a specific version of the codec

   Transition Time Stamp (32 bits):  The RTP Time Stamp value when the
      listed codec configuration parameters will be effective in the
      media stream, using the same time line as RTP packets for the
      referenced SSRC (media sender SSRC).  The Time Stamp value MAY
      express either a time in the past or in the future, and need not
      map exactly to an actual RTP Time Stamp present in an RTP packet

      for that SSRC.  The same timestamp value SHOULD be used for
      subsequent transmissions of the identical set of codec
      configuration parameters for the same OPID and version.

   R (1 bit):  Reserved.  MUST be set to 0 by senders and MUST be
      ignored by receivers implementing this specification.  MAY be
      defined differently by extensions to this specification.

   Payload Type (7 bits):  SHALL be identical to the RTP header Payload
      Type valid for the (sub-)stream described by this OPID.

   Codec Configuration Parameters (variable length):  Contains zero or
      more TLV carrying codec configuration parameters as defined in
      parameter types (Section 8).

7.3.2.  Semantics

   This message is used to inform the media receiver(s) about used codec
   configuration parameters at the media sender.  The available codec
   parameter types that can be used to describe the codec configuration
   are defined in Section 8.

   Some codecs may have clear inband indications in the encoded media
   stream of how one or more of the codec configuration parameters are
   configured.  For those codecs and codec configuration parameters,
   COPN is not strictly necessary.  Still, for some codecs and / or for
   some codec configuration parameters, it is not unambiguously possible
   to see individual codec configuration parameter values from the
   encoded media stream, or even possible to see some codec
   configuration parameters at all, motivating use of COPN.

   COPN SHOULD be scheduled for transmission when it becomes known that
   there are media receivers in the RTP session that did not yet receive
   any codec configuration parameters for an active operation point, or
   whenever the effective codec configuration parameters has changed
   significantly, but MAY be scheduled for transmission at any time.
   The media sender decides what amount of change is required to be
   considered significant.

   The reason for a codec configuration parameter change can either be
   local to the sending terminal, for example as a result of user
   interaction or some algorithmic decision, or resulting from reception
   of one or more COPR messages (Section 7.4).

   If a media sender can no longer fulfill the established codec
   configuration parameter restrictions of a operation point that was
   previously described by a COPN, it MAY change any codec configuration
   parameter or even remove the entire operation point, and SHOULD then

   signal this at the earliest opportunity by sending an updated COPN to
   the media receiver(s).

   An OPID can implicitly be indicated as no longer being used by
   omitting that OPID from the set of COPN message items in the COP PSFB
   message.  All OPIDs that the media sender intends to use at the
   latest time indicated by any transition timestamp value in the set of
   COPN present in the COP PSFB message, MUST be included in that COP
   message.

   All operation points referred by a COPS (Section 7.5) SHOULD also be
   detailed by a COPN message contained in the same or in a subsequent
   COP feedback message, even if the operation point did not change
   significantly from previous COPN.

   Note that the OPID Version of that COPN, subsequent to COPS, will be
   equal or larger than the Version indicated in the COPS.  The Version
   difference may be larger than one (taking field wraparound into
   account) depending on the number of updated COPN sent since the COPR
   that triggered the COPS.  See also description of those messages
   below.

   Note: COPN may be seen as a more explicit and elaborate version of
   the TSTN message of [RFC5104] and most of the considerations detailed
   there for TSTN also apply to COPN.

7.3.2.1.  Parameters

   The media sender decides what codec configuration parameters to use
   in the COPN to describe an operation point.  It is RECOMMENDED that
   all codec configuration parameters that were accepted as restrictions
   based on received COPR messages are included.  All codec
   configuration parameters significantly more restrictive than implicit
   or explicit restrictions set by capability signaling (outside the
   scope of this specification) SHOULD also be included.  Any codec
   configuration parameter that are either not applicable to the Payload
   Type or not enabled by capability signaling MUST NOT be included.
   All codec configuration parameters not covered by the above
   restrictions MAY be included.

   When the operation point has dependency to other operation points
   (such as in scalable coding), the values to use for codec
   configuration parameters MUST describe the result when all
   dependencies are utilized.  For example, assume an operation point
   describing a base layer with 15 Hz framerate, and a dependent
   operation point describing an enhancement layer adding another 15 Hz
   to the base layer, resulting in 30 Hz framerate when both layers are
   combined.  The correct parameter value to use for that latter,



Westerlund, et al.       Expires April 25, 2013                [Page 33]

Internet-Draft                     COP                      October 2012


   dependent "enhancement" operation point is 30 Hz, not the 15 Hz
   difference.

   The value of a codec configuration parameter that was not included in
   a COPN message SHOULD either be inferred from other signaling, e.g.
   session setup or capability negotiation, outside the scope of this
   specification, or if such signaling is not available or not
   applicable, use the default value as defined per parameter type
   (Section 8).

   An operation point describes one specific setting of codec
   parameters, and a COPN message therefore MUST NOT include the ALT
   parameter type (Section 8.2) in the codec parameters describing the
   operation point.

7.3.2.2.  Relation to COPR

   To limit RTCP bandwidth and avoid bandwidth expansion, COPN is not
   mandated as response to every received COPR (Section 7.4).

   A media sender implementing this specification SHOULD take requested
   operation points from COPR messages into account for future encoding,
   but MAY decide to use other codec configuration parameter values than
   those requested, e.g. as a result of multiple (possibly
   contradicting) COPR messages from different media receivers, or any
   media sender policies, rules or limitations.  Thus, a COPN message
   operation point MAY use other codec configuration parameters and
   other values than those requested in a COPR.

   The media sender SHOULD try to maintain OPIDs between COPR and COPN
   when COPR sender suggests a new OPID value (N flag is set) in the
   COPR, but MAY use another OPID in COPN.  Examples where other OPID
   values have to be chosen are for example when the suggested OPID
   conflicts with an already existing OPID, or when the media sender
   decides that a the suggested new OPID can be fulfilled by an already
   existing OPID.

   Even if a COPR references an existing OPID (N flag cleared), the
   media sender may have to take other aspects than a specific COPR into
   account when choosing how many operation points to use, and the exact
   contents of those operation points.  See the description on COPS
   (Section 7.5) on how to achieve mapping between a suggested new OPID
   and what OPID will actually be used.

   When OPID cannot be kept the same between COPN and COPR, the mapping
   SHALL be done using identical ID parameters (Section 8.3) in the COPS
   and COPN resulting from the COPR.  Further details are described in
   the section on COPS (Section 7.5).

   Since COPR references a certain COPN OPID, Version, and COPN is send
   unreliably and may be lost, COPN senders MUST keep at least the two
   last COPN Versions for each SSRC, OPID tuple and SHOULD keep at least
   four.

7.3.3.  Timing Rules

   The timing follows the rules outlined in section 3 of AVPF [RFC4585].
   This notification message may be time critical and SHOULD be sent
   using early or immediate feedback RTCP timing, but MAY be sent using
   regular RTCP timing.

   A typical example when regular RTCP timing can be appropriate is when
   the sent media stream is further restricted from what was described
   by the most recent COPN, which should not cause any problems in the
   media receivers.  Similarly, it is likely appropriate to use early or
   immediate timing when effective media stream restrictions urgently
   needs to be removed, which may require media receivers to increase
   their resource usage.

   Version (7 bits):  When N flag is not set (0), referencing a specific
      version of the codec configuration identified by the OPID in a
      COPN received from the targeted media sender.  Not used and MUST
      be set to 0 when N flag is set (1).

   Sequence No (8 bits):  Sequence Number.  SHALL be incremented by 1
      modulo 2^8 for every COPR that includes an updated set of
      requested codec configuration parameters described by the same
      OPID and Version as was used with the previous Sequence Number.
      Sequence Number SHALL be kept unchanged in repetitions of this
      message.  Initial value SHOULD be chosen randomly.

   Codec Configuration Parameters (variable length):  Contains zero or
      more TLV carrying codec configuration parameters as defined in
      parameter types (Section 8).

7.4.2.  Semantics

   This message item is sent by a media receiver wanting to control one
   or more codec configuration parameters of the targeted media sender.
   The requested values MUST stay within the media capability negotiated
   by other means than this specification.  The available codec
   configuration parameters that can be controlled are listed in
   Section 8.

   Note: COPR may be seen as a more explicit and elaborate version of
   the TSTR message of [RFC5104] and most of the considerations detailed
   there for TSTR also apply to COPR.

7.4.2.1.  Sender Behavior

   If at least one COPN (Section 7.3) is received for the targeted
   stream, the codec configuration parameters for that stream (SSRC)
   with defined OPID and Version are known to the COPR sender.  The COPR
   MUST refer to the OPID and Version of the most recently received COPN
   (if any) for the targeted stream.  Since it references a defined set
   of codec configuration parameters from a COPN, the COPR SHOULD only
   include the codec configuration parameters it wishes to change in the
   message, but it MAY include also unchanged codec configuration
   parameters.

   If no COPN is received for the targeted stream, the COPR sender MUST
   choose an arbitrary OPID and set the N flag to indicate that the OPID
   does not refer to any existing operation point.  In this case the
   Version field is not used and MUST be set to 0.  The OPID value SHALL
   NOT be identical to any OPID from the same media source that the
   media receiver is aware of and has received COPN for.  Since in this
   case no COPN reference exist, the COPR sender SHOULD include all

Internet-Draft                     COP                      October 2012


   codec configuration parameters that it wishes to include a specific
   restriction for (other than the default).  Note that for some codecs,
   some codec configuration parameters may be possible to infer from the
   media stream, but if the wanted restriction includes also those and
   lacking a describing COPN, they SHOULD anyway be included explicitly
   in the COPR.

   Any codec configuration parameter that are not enabled by capability
   signaling MUST NOT be included.

   A COPR sender MUST increment the SN field modulo 2^8 with every new
   COPR that includes any update to the codec configuration parameters
   (referring to a specific version of an OPID compared to the
   previously sent SN, as long as it does not receive any COPS
   (Section 7.5) with the same OPID, Version, and SN as was used in the
   most recently sent COPR.  COPR having a later SN MUST be interpreted
   as replacing any COPR with identical OPID and Version but with lower
   SN, taking field wrap into account.

   A COPR sender that did not receive any corresponding COPS, but did
   receive a COPN with the same OPID and with a higher Version than was
   used in the last COPR SHALL reconsider the COPR and MAY send an
   updated COPR referencing the new Version.

   If the capability negotiation has established that a codec supporting
   scalable operation is used, and if the media receiver wishes to
   request that scalability is used, it MAY do so by sending multiple
   COPR with different OPID to the same media sender.  The OPID and
   Version used in such request MAY be based on an existing operation
   point, but it MAY also indicate a desire to introduce scalability
   into a previously non-scalable stream by choosing a new OPID
   (indicated by setting the N flag).  In any case, the resulting OPIDs
   and sub-streams are identified through use of the ID parameter
   (Section 8.3) in subsequent COPS and COPN.  See also the description
   of COPS (Section 7.5).

   An operation point without any codec configuration parameters MAY be
   used and MUST be interpreted as a request to keep the operation point
   unchanged.  This is especially useful when modifying some but not all
   in a set of sub-streams.

   When a COPR sender is receiving multiple operation points and wants
   to continue to do so, it MUST include all operation points it still
   wishes to receive in the COPR, also those that can be left unchanged.

   An COPR MAY also describe alternative operation points that the media
   sender can choose from, through use of one or more ALT parameters
   (Section 8.2).

Internet-Draft                     COP                      October 2012


   Since COPR references a specific COPN using SSRC, OPID and Version, a
   COPR sender typically needs to keep the latest Version of received
   COPN for each SSRC and OPID, also including the codec configuration
   parameters.

7.4.2.2.  Media Sender Behavior

   A media sender receiving a COPR SHOULD take the request into account
   for future encoding, but MAY also take COPR from other media
   receivers and other information available to the media sender into
   account when deciding how to change encoding properties.

   A media receiver sending COPR thus cannot always expect that all
   parameter values of the request are fully honored, or even honored at
   all.  It can only know that the COPR was taken into account when
   receiving a COPS (Section 7.5) from the media sender with a matching
   OPID, Version and SN.

   To what extent a COPR is honored is described by the chosen codec
   configuration parameter values contained in a subsequent COPN message
   (Section 7.3) with a later (taking wraparound into account) Version
   than the one referred by the COPR.

7.4.3.  Timing Rules

   The timing follows the rules outlined in section 3 of [RFC4585].
   This request message MAY be sent using Immediate, Early or Regular
   timing depending on the application's needs.

   A COPR sender that did not receive a corresponding COPS MAY choose to
   retransmit the COPR, without increasing the SN.

   When an RTP media receiver (SSRC) is timing out or leaves (BYE
   received) from the RTP session, it SHALL implicitly imply that all
   COPR restrictions put by that media receiver are removed.

7.5.2.  Semantics

   The COPS message item indicates the request status related to a
   certain SSRC OPID tuple by listing the latest received COPR
   (Section 7.4) SN.  It effectively informs the COPR sender that it no
   longer needs to resend that COPR SN (or any previous SN).

   COPS indicates that the specified COPR was successfully received by
   the media sender targeted in the request.  If the COPR suggested
   codec configuration parameters could be understood (Table 2), they
   may be taken into account, possibly together with COPR messages from
   other receivers and other aspects applicable to the specific media
   sender.  The Return Code carries an indication to which extent the
   COPR could be honored.

   A Success Return Code indicates that the resulting media
   configuration is fully in line with the COPR.

   A Partial Success Return Code indicates that the resulting media
   configuration is not fully in line with the COPR, but that the media
   sender regards the COPR to be sufficiently well represented by one or
   more of the existing operation points.

   A Failure Return code indicates that the media sender failed to take
   the COPR into account, either due to some error condition or because
   no media stream could be created or changed to comply.

                          Table 3: Reason Values

   COPS is typically sent without any codec configuration parameters.
   When the N flag was set in the related COPR, a non-failing COPS MUST
   include an ID parameter (Section 8.3) identifying the actual sub-
   stream that the media sender considers applicable to the COPR.  The
   OPID used by that sub-stream can be found through examining ID
   parameters of subsequent COPN from the same media source for ID
   values matching the one in COPS.

   Senders implementing this specification MUST NOT use any other codec
   configuration parameter types than ID in a COPS message.  The
   contained ID parameter points to the specific media (sub-)stream that
   the media sender regards as applicable to the COPR.

   When a COPR receiver has received multiple COPR messages from a
   single COPR source with the same OPID but with several different
   values of Version and/or SN, and for which it has not yet sent a
   COPS, it SHALL only send COPS for the COPR with the Highest SN,
   taking field wrap of those two fields into account.

7.5.3.  Timing Rules

   COPS SHALL be sent at the earliest opportunity after having received
   a COPR, with the following exception:

      A media sender that receives a COPR with a previously received
      OPID, Version, and SN closely after sending a COPS for that same
      OPID, Version, and SN (within 2 times the longest observed round
      trip time, plus any AVPF-induced packet sending delays), SHOULD
      await a repeated COPR before scheduling another COPS transmission
      for that OPID, Version, and SN.

Internet-Draft                     COP                      October 2012


   The exception is introduced to avoid unnecessary COPS transmission
   when there is a chance that already sent COPS or COPN may satisfy or
   invalidate the COPR.

7.6.  Handling in Mixers and Translators

7.6.1.  COPN

   Any media sender, including mixers and translators, that sends RTP
   media marked with it's own SSRC and that implements this
   specification SHALL also be prepared to send COPN, even if it is not
   the originating media source.  As a result of that, such media sender
   may have to send updated COPN whenever the included media sources
   (CSRC) changes, subject to rules laid out above (Section 7.3.2).
   Note that this can be achieved in different ways, for example by
   forwarding (possibly cached) COPN from the included CSRC when the
   mixer is not performing transcoding.

   In cases where a mixer or translator needs to forward a COPR from one
   side (A) to the other (B) (as described in Section 7.6.2), the COPN
   sent to the A side MAY need to be delayed until the mixer or
   translator has received a corresponding COPN from the B side, as
   indicated in Figure 13 below.
               +-------+ 1. COPR +-------+ 2. COPR +-------+
               |       |-------->|       |-------->|       |

   If a mixer or translator has decided to act partially (modify the
   media stream with respect to some parameter types, but not all) on a
   received COPR from the A side, and a COPN is received from the B side
   indicating that the current media modifications are no longer
   necessary, the mixer or translator SHOULD cease it's own actions that
   are no longer needed.  It SHOULD then also issue a COPN describing
   the new situation to the A side, as indicated in Figure 14 below.

7.6.2.  COPR

   A mixer or media translator that implements this specification and
   encodes content sent to the media receiver issuing the COPR SHALL
   consider the request to determine if it can fulfill it by changing
   its own encoding parameters.  A mixer encoding for multiple session
   participants will need to consider the joint needs of all
   participants when generating a COPR on its own behalf towards the
   media sender.

   A mixer or translator able to fulfill the COPR partially MAY act on
   the parts it can fulfill (and SHALL then send COPS and COPN
   accordingly), but SHOULD anyway forward the unaltered COPR towards
   the media sender, since it is likely most efficient to make the
   necessary codec configuration parameter changes directly at the
   original media source.

   A media translator that does not act on COP messages will forward
   them unaltered, according to normal translator rules.

7.6.3.  COPS

   A mixer or media translator that implements this specification,
   encoding content sent to media receivers and that acts on COPR SHALL
   also report using COPS, just like any other media sender.  An RTP
   translator not knowing or acting on COPR will forward all COP
   messages unaltered, according to normal RTP translator rules.


8.  Parameter Types

   This section defines the general codec configuration parameter (CCP)
   TLV format.  Then a number of different parameter formats are
   defined.  It is expected that a number of additional CCPs will be
   defined in the future as the needs of different codecs are explored
   or developed.

8.1.  Parameter Format

   COP message items MAY contain one or more codec configuration
   parameters, encoded in TLV (Type-Length-Value) format, which SHOULD
   then be interpreted as simultaneously applicable to the defined
   operation point.  Parameter values MUST be byte-aligned.

                     Figure 15: Codec parameter format

   ParamType (8 bits):  The codec configuration parameter type, encoded
      as defined in Table 4 and possible extensions to this
      specification.  A parameter with an unknown ParamType SHALL be
      ignored on reception in a COPN and SHALL either be reported as
      unknown in COPS or be ignored when received in COPR.

   C (2 bits):  Comparison Type, encoded as defined in Table 5, unless
      specified otherwise by individual ParamType definitions.  The
      Comparison Type specifies what type of restriction the codec
      configuration parameter value expresses and how it should be
      compared to other codec configuration parameter values of the same
      ParamType.

      Exact:  The parameter value is an exact value, and no other values
         are acceptable.  MUST NOT be used together with any other
         Comparison Types for the same ParamType.

      Minimum:  The parameter value is an inclusive minimum restriction.
         MAY be used together with Maximum and/or Target Comparison
         Types for the same ParamType.  If no minimum restriction is
         specified, no specific minimum restriction exist.

      Maximum:  The parameter value is an inclusive maximum restriction.
         MAY be used together with Minimum and/or Target Comparison
         Types for the same ParamType.  If no maximum restriction is
         specified, no specific maximum restriction exist.

      Target:  The parameter value is a preferred target value, but
         other values within a specified range are acceptable.  This
         type MUST be used together with at least one of Minimum and
         Maximum Comparison Types for the same ParamType.  If no target
         is specified, no specific preference exist.

   Length (6 bits):  The parameter value Length in bytes, excluding the
      ParamType and the Length field itself.  A Length of 0 indicates
      that the parameter has no value, effectively constituting a wild-
      carded parameter that can take on any value (expresses no specific
      restriction).  This is also the RECOMMENDED way to explicitly
      remove a previously effective restriction.

   Parameter Value (variable length):  The actual parameter value,
      encoded in a format defined by the specific ParamType definition.

   The meaning of Multiple codec configuration parameters with the same
   ParamType and the same Comparison Type included as part of the same
   operation point is undefined and SHALL NOT be used.

   A codec configuration parameter that is encoded in a way (including
   incorrectly) that cannot be interpreted by the receiver SHALL be
   ignored.

   The below parameters encoded as signed or unsigned integers uses a
   variable size representation in the value field.  It is RECOMMENDED
   to only include the minimal number of bytes necessary to represent
   the value that is to be included in the parameter TLV.  The length
   field in the parameter TLV will explicitly indicate how many bytes
   are present in the value field.  All parameters using a variable size
   representation of their value MUST define the maximum number of bytes
   possible to include in the value field.

   The ParamType values and the SDP tags (see Section 9) for the codec
   configuration parameter types defined in this specification are
   listed below.

8.2.  ALT

   This codec parameter type is a special parameter, separating the
   codec configuration parameters preceding it from the ones that follow
   into two separate, alternative operation points.

   Type Value:  0

   Tag:  alt

   Unit:  Not applicable.

   Semantics:  A special parameter expressing an "alternative" relation
      between the parameters preceding it and the parameters following
      it.  This SHOULD be interpreted as describing two alternate
      operation points where one and only one SHALL be chosen, with the
      operation point preceding ALT in the parameter list being
      preferred.  Multiple ALT parameters MAY be used in the same
      parameter list, in which case each set of parameters to evaluate
      can be either before the first ALT parameter, between two ALT
      parameters, or after the last ALT parameter.  Evaluating from the
      top of the list and obeying the above preference rule, the first
      acceptable set of parameters (not containing any ALT parameter) is
      the one to choose.

   Encoding:  Not applicable.

   Media Types:  All.

   Value Restrictions:  MUST be used with the Length field set to 0.
      Two ALT parameters MUST be separated by at least one parameter
      other than ALT.

   Default Value:  Not applicable.

   Comparison Types:  MUST be set to 0.

   Note:

8.3.  ID

   This codec parameter type is a special parameter that enables codec
   specific identification of sub-streams, for example when there are
   multiple sub-streams in a single SSRC.  It can also be used to
   reference OPID, when the used codec does not support or use sub-
   streams.  When used, it SHALL be listed first among the codec
   parameters used to describe the sub-stream.

   Type Value:  1

   Tag:  id

   Unit:  Not applicable.

   Semantics:  A special parameter describing the, possibly codec
      specific, media identification for the OPID.

   Encoding:  If used with non-scalable encoding, it MUST contain an
      OPID (Section 7.2.1).  If used with scalable encoding, this codec
      specific encoding MUST be defined by Section 10.  It MUST be
      defined to occupy an integer number of bytes, where all bits in
      the bytes are defined as part of the format.

   Media Types:  All.

   Value Restrictions:  If used with non-scalable encoding, any OPID
      restrictions apply.  If used with scalable encoding, any
      restrictions MUST be defined by the definition of the codec
      specific sub-stream identification definition (Section 10).

   Default Value:  Not set.

   Comparison Types:  MUST be set to 0.

   Note:  MAY be used whenever there is a need to identify an operation
      point in codec native format, or when there is a need to map that
      against an OPID.

8.4.  Payload Type

   Type Value:  2

   Tag:  pt

   Unit:  Not applicable.

   Semantics:  Referencing the RTP Payload Type to use for the OPID.

   Encoding:  The least significant 7 bits MUST use the same encoding as
      the RTP Payload Type field in the RTP header.  The most
      significant bit MUST be set to 0.

   Media Types:  All.

Internet-Draft                     COP                      October 2012


   Value Restrictions:  The same restrictions valid for RTP Payload Type
      apply, i.e. 7-bit values 0-127.  MUST be represented by a single
      byte in the value field.

   Default Value:  Not set.

   Comparison Types:  MUST be set to 0.

   Note:  MAY be used whenever there is a need to specify codec
      configuration parameters valid only for a certain RTP Payload
      Type.  What media type, codec and possible parameters that are
      described by the RTP Payload Type is outside the scope of this
      specification, but is typically defined in capability or call
      setup signaling, for example SDP.

8.5.  Bitrate

   Type Value:  3

   Tag:  bitrate

   Unit:  Bits per second.

   Semantics:  Media level per second average media bitrate, excluding
      IP/UDP/RTP overhead, but including RTP payload headers (similar to
      b=TIAS from SDP signaling [RFC3890]), rounded up to the closest
      integer.

   Encoding:  Binary encoded unsigned integer, most significant byte
      first.

   Media Types:  All.

   Value Restrictions:  A value of 0 MAY be used.  The largest value
      allowed is what is possible to represent in a 64-bit unsigned
      integer value, i.e. a value between 0 and
      18,446,744,073,709,551,615.

   Default Value:  Maximum value computed from capability or call setup
      signaling, e.g. b= parameter from SDP.  Note that it is often not
      possible to achieve more than a rough estimation from such
      computation.

   Comparison Types:  All. The Exact comparison type is meaningful only
      for streams that are able to produce a set of predictable (e.g.
      constant) packet sizes, sent at predictable (e.g. constant) inter-
      packet intervals.

   Note:  This parameter used with a maximum comparison type parameter
      is significantly similar to CCM Temporary Maximum Media Bit Rate
      (TMMBR).  When being used with a maximum or exact comparison type
      value of 0, it is also significantly similar to PAUSE
      [I-D.westerlund-avtext-rtp-stream-pause].  Compared to those, this
      parameter conveys significant extra information through the
      relation to other parameters applied to the same operation point,
      as well as the possibility to express other restrictions than a
      maximum limit.  When CCM TMMBR is supported in addition to this
      specification, the Bitrate parameters from all operation points
      within each SSRC should be considered and CCM TMMBR messages
      SHOULD be sent for those SSRC that are found to be in the bounding
      set (see CCM [RFC5104], section 3.5.4.2).  When PAUSE is supported
      in addition to this specification, the Bitrate parameters from all
      operation points within each SSRC should be considered and CCM
      PAUSE messages SHOULD be sent for those SSRC that contain only
      operation points that are limited by a Bitrate maximum value of 0.
      There only difference between setting the bitrate to 0 and
      removing the OPID entirely is that increasing the bitrate from 0
      just requires the bitrate parameter to be sent again, while re-
      activating a removed OPID requires it to be fully re-defined
      including all other parameters that are included in the OPID.

8.6.  Token Bucket Size

   Type Value:  4

   Tag:  token-bucket

   Unit:  Bytes.

   Semantics:  Media level token bucket [RFC2212] size excluding IP/UDP/
      RTP overhead, but including RTP payload headers, describing the
      bitrate variability over time as described in
      [I-D.westerlund-mmusic-sdp-bw-attribute].  This parameter can be
      combined with the parameter bitrate (Section 8.5) (above) to
      provide token bucket fill rate plus bucket size for a complete
      token bucket model.

   Encoding:  Binary encoded unsigned integer, most significant byte
      first.

   Media Types:  All.

   Value Restrictions:  A value of 0 is generally not meaningful and
      SHOULD NOT be used.  Values that can be represented using a 32-bit
      unsigned integer, i.e. 0 to 4,294,967,295.

Internet-Draft                     COP                      October 2012


   Default Value:  4096 bytes.

   Comparison Types:  Maximum, Target.

   Note:  Changing the token bucket size does not imply changing the
      average bitrate, it just changes the acceptable average bitrate
      variation over time.

8.7.  Framerate

   Type Value:  5

   Tag:  framerate

   Unit:  100th of a Hz.  This definition allows e.g. distinguishing
      between video encoded at 30 Hz (two-byte value 3000) and 29.97 Hz
      (two-byte value 2997).  It also allows for high speed video
      cameras, like 1000 Hz (three-byte value 100000), and slow-scan
      down to one frame every 100 seconds (one-byte value 1).

   Semantics:  The number of media frames to render per second.

   Encoding:  Binary encoded unsigned integer, most significant byte
      first.

   Media Types:  Mainly intended for video and timed image media types,
      but MAY be used also for other media types.

   Value Restrictions:  A value of 0 MAY be used, meaning single-frame,
      request based encoding (request procedure is out of scope for this
      specification).  Values that can be represented using a 32-bit
      unsigned integer, i.e. 0 to 42,949,672.95 Hz.

   Default Value:  Maximum allowed by call setup and/or capability
      signaling, e.g. a=framerate parameter from SDP [RFC4566], or
      codec-specific configuration.

   Comparison Types:  All.

   Note:  A media frame is typically a set of semantically grouped
      samples, e.g. the relation that a video image has to its
      individual pixels, or the relation that an audio frame has to
      individual audio samples.  The value applies to encoded media
      framerate, not the packet rate (Section 8.15) that may also be
      changed as a result of different Frame Aggregation (Section 8.16).
      When the COP end-point also makes use of CCM [RFC5104] TSTR/TSTN,
      COPN with this parameter MAY be used in combination with TSTN to
      explicitly indicate what framerate setting the TSTR resulted in,

      making it possible for the TSTR sender to adjust the used,
      relative TSTR scale to more closely match what framerate was
      actually received.

8.8.  Horizontal Pixels

   Type Value:  6

   Tag:  hor-size

   Unit:  Pixels.

   Semantics:  Horizontal image size.

   Encoding:  Binary encoded unsigned integer, most significant byte
      first.

   Media Types:  Video and image.

   Value Restrictions:  The meaning of the value 0 is not defined and
      SHALL NOT be used.

   Default Value:  Maximum allowed by call setup and/or capability
      signaling.  Values that can be represented using a 32-bit unsigned
      integer, i.e. 1 to 4,294,967,295.

   Comparison Types:  All.

   Note:  The pixel and picture aspect ratios cannot be changed with
      this parameter.  Video encoders can typically describe both pixel
      and picture aspect ratios as part of the encoded media stream.  If
      the COP end-point supports imageattr signaling [RFC6236], values
      for this parameter SHOULD be chosen only among the negotiated set
      in the SDP, and should be done so both for the media receiving
      COPR sender and the media sending COPN sender, according to
      imageattr values for the affected media stream direction.

8.9.  Vertical Pixels

   Default Value:  Taken from call setup or capability signaling, or 1
      if no other value is available.

   Comparison Types:  All.

   Note:  This codec configuration parameter SHOULD NOT be used if the
      capability negotiation did not establish that suitable multi-
      channel coding is supported by both ends.  For audio, the
      interpretation and spatial mapping SHALL follow the one for the
      indicated payload format.  If no such channel mapping is defined
      in the payload format, and if not specifically signalled by other
      means, e.g.  SDP, the channel configurations defined in [RFC3551]
      SHALL be used.  For video, it SHALL be interpreted as the number
      of views in multiview coding, where the number 2 SHOULD represent
      stereo (3D) coding, unless negotiated otherwise by means outside
      of this specification, e.g.  SDP.  If multiple payload formats are
      defined and if those do not share channel configurations, the

      the codec, per channel (Section 8.12).

   Encoding:  Binary encoded unsigned integer, most significant byte
      first.

   Media Types:  Mainly intended for audio media, but MAY be used for
      other media types.

   Value Restrictions:  The meaning of the value 0 is not defined and
      SHALL NOT be used.  Values that can be represented using a 32-bit
      unsigned integer, i.e. 1 to 4,294,967,295.

   Default Value:  Taken from call setup or capability signaling, e.g.
      RTP TS rate from SDP m-line.

   Comparison Types:  All.

   Note:  The value refers to the media sample clock, not the media
      Framerate (Section 8.7).  It does not specify any codec-internal
      up- or down-sampling that may take place as part of the encoding
      process.  If multiple channels (Section 8.12) are used and
      different channels use different sampling rates, then this
      parameter MUST NOT be used unless there is a known sampling rate
      relationship and an ordering between the channels, in which case
      the specified sampling rate value SHALL be taken as applicable to
      the first channel of the ordered set.  The relationship may e.g.
      be known implicitly by each party through some specification, or
      be negotiated using other means than this specification.
      Typically only a limited subset of sampling frequencies makes
      sense to the media encoder, and sometimes it is not possible to
      change at all.  For video, the sampling rate is very closely
      connected to the image horizontal (Section 8.8), vertical
      (Section 8.9) resolution, and framerate (Section 8.7), which are
      more explicit and meaningful and SHOULD therefore be used instead.
      For audio, changing sampling rate may require changing codec and
      thus changing RTP payload type.  The actual media sampling rate
      may not be identical to the sampling rate specified for RTP Time
      Stamps for that RTP Payload Type.  E.g. almost all video codecs
      use only 90 000 Hz sampling clock for RTP Time Stamps, while the
      actual pixel sampling clock is typically in the range from a few
      to several hundred MHz.  Also some recent audio codecs use an RTP
      Time Stamp rate that differ from the actual media sampling rate.
      Aspects related to mid-stream changes of RTP Time Stamp rate is
      described in [I-D.ietf-avtext-multiple-clock-rates].

   Type Value:  12

   Tag:  max-rtp-size

   Unit:  Bytes.

   Semantics:  The maximum size of an RTP packet, including the RTP
      header but excluding lower layers.

   Encoding:  Binary encoded unsigned integer, most significant byte
      first.

   Media Types:  All.

   Value Restrictions:  The meaning of a value less than the size of the
      RTP header (12 bytes for current RTP specification [RFC3550]) is
      not defined and SHOULD NOT be used.  Values that can be
      represented using a 32-bit unsigned integer, i.e. 0 to
      4,294,967,295.

   Default Value:  1400 bytes for IPv4, 1280 bytes for IPv6 or if IP
      version cannot be determined.

   Comparison Types:  Maximum.

   Note:  The parameter should typically be used to adapt encoding to a
      known or assumed MTU limitation, and MAY be used to assist MTU
      path discovery in point-to-point as well as in RTP mixer or
      translator topologies.

8.15.  Maximum RTP Packet Rate

      estimated as the largest value appearing during a one-second
      sliding window, similar to the definition of "maxprate" [RFC3890].

      SHALL NOT be used.  Values that can be represented using a 32-bit
      unsigned integer, i.e. 1 to 4,294,967,295.

   Default Value:  Not set.

   Comparison Types:  Maximum.

   Note:  The parameter should typically be used to adapt encoding on a
      network that is packet rate rather than bitrate limited, if such
      property is known.  This codec configuration parameter MUST NOT
      exceed any negotiated "maxprate" [RFC3890] value, if present.

8.16.  Application Data Unit Aggregation

   Type Value:  14

   Tag:  aggregate

   Unit:  Milliseconds.

   Semantics:  The amount of non-redundant application data unit (ADU)
      representing different RTP Time Stamps that should be included in
      the RTP payload, henceforth in this specification called an "ADU
      aggregate".  An ADU aggregation value of 1 is equivalent to no
      aggregation.

   Encoding:  Binary encoded unsigned integer, most significant byte
      first.

   Media Types:  Mainly intended for audio, but MAY be used also for
      other media, e.g.  Real-Time Text [RFC4103].

   Value Restrictions:  The meaning of the value 0 is not defined and
      SHALL NOT be used.  Values that can be represented using a 16-bit

      do not allow multiple ADUs (representing different sampling times)
      in the RTP payload.  This codec configuration parameter SHOULD NOT
      be used unless the "maxprate" [RFC3890] and/or "ptime" parameters
      are included in the SDP.  The requested ADU aggregation level MUST
      NOT cause exceeding the negotiated "maxprate" value, if present,
      and SHOULD NOT exceed the negotiated "ptime" value, if present.
      The requested frame aggregation level MUST NOT be in conflict with
      any Maximum RTP Packet Size (Section 8.14) or Maximum RTP Packet
      Rate (Section 8.15) parameters.  The packet rate that may result
      from different frame aggregation values is related to, but
      semantically not the same as, media Framerate (Section 8.7).


9.  SDP Extensions

   As described in [RFC4585] and [RFC5104], the rtcp-fb attribute may be
   used to negotiate capability to handle specific AVPF commands and
   indications, and specifically the "ccm" feedback value is used for
   codec control.  All rules defined there related to use of "rtcp-fb"
   and "ccm" also apply to the new feedback message defined in this
   specification.

9.1.  Extension of the rtcp-fb Attribute

   In this document, a new "ccm" rtcp-fb-ccm-param is defined, according
   to the method of extension described in [RFC5104]:

   o  "cop" indicates support for all COP message items defined in this
      specification, and one or more of the codec configuration
      parameters defined in this specification

   Token values for rtcp-fb-ccm-cop-param are defined in Table 4.  Their
   semantics are described in Section 8.

   Supported parameter types are indicated by including one or more
   rtcp-fb-ccm-cop-param.

9.2.  Offer/Answer Usage

   The usage of Offer/Answer [RFC3264] in this specification inherits
   all applicable usage defined in [RFC5104].

   In order to announce support, and willingness to use, the CCM "cop"
   feedback message, an offerer or answerer SHALL indicate that
   capability through the extended SDP rtcp-fb attribute, defined in
   Section 9.1.  The offerer or answerer MUST include a list of the
   parameter types that it is willing to receive.

   If an SDP offer does not indicate support of the CCM "cop" feedback
   message, the answerer MUST NOT indicate support in the associated SDP
   answer.

   The answerer MAY add and/or remove parameter types that were not
   present in the associated SDP offer.  If the answerer adds parameter
   types to the SDP answer, it MUST be able to receive such messages,
   but the answerer MUST NOT send such messages towards the offerer.

Internet-Draft                     COP                      October 2012


   If an SDP answer does not indicate support of the CCM "cop" feedback
   message, the offerer MUST NOT send such messages towards the
   answerer.

   The offerer and the answerer SHOULD NOT send any parameter types that
   the remote party did not indicate receive support for.  As described
   in Section 8, a parameter with an unknown ParamType SHALL be ignored
   on reception in a COPN and SHALL either be reported as unknown in
   COPS or be ignored when received in COPR.

   Entities MUST list all supported parameter types in every subsequent
   SDP offer or answer associated with the session.  If a parameter type
   is not listed, it is an indication that the offerer or answerer is no
   longer willing to receive such messages within the session.

9.3.  Declarative Usage

   Declarative use of the CCM "cop" does not differ from the Offer/
   Answer usage.


10.  Codec Sub-Stream Identification

   The defined mechanism is not bound to a specific codec.  It uses the
   main characteristics of a chosen set of media types, including audio
   and video.  To what extent this mechanism can be applied depends on
   which specific codec is used.

   When using a codec that can produce separate sub-streams within a
   single SSRC, those sub-streams can only be referred with a COP OPID
   if there is a defined relation to the codec-specific sub-stream
   identification.  This is accomplished in this specification by
   defining an ID parameter format using codec-specific sub-stream
   identification for each such codec.

   If such sub-streams have dependencies, the OPID describes the
   characteristics of the sub-stream including all it's dependencies,
   but excluding any sub-streams that are dependent on this sub-stream.
   The sub-stream identification describes a single, payload specific
   node in a dependency tree, and does in general not include any
   identification of the sub-streams it depends on, or the dependency
   structure between sub-streams.  Any dependency structure must thus be
   described by the media stream payload format and is out of scope for
   this specification.

   This section contains ID parameter format definitions for a few
   selected codecs.  The format definitions MUST use an integer number
   of bytes and MUST define all bits in those bytes.  Note, the ID

   parameter is interpreted in the context of a given SSRC and a
   specific RTP payload type.

   Extensions to this specification MAY add more codec-specific
   definitions than the ones described in the sub-sections below.  Such
   definitions made in extensions to this specification SHOULD be
   considered as an integrated part of this section, with respect to
   usage with other mechanisms defined in this specification.

10.1.  H.264 AVC

   Some non-scalable video codecs such as H.264 AVC [H264] and
   corresponding RTP payload format [RFC6184] can accomplish
   simultaneous encoding of multiple operation points.  H.264 AVC can
   encode a video stream using limited-reference and non-reference
   frames such that it enables limited temporal scalability, by use of
   the nal_ref_id syntax element.

   The ID parameter type is defined below:
                              0
                              0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

      defined differently by extensions to this specification.

   N (2 bits):  SHALL be identical to the highest value of the
      nal_ref_idc H.264 NAL header syntax element valid for the sub-
      bitstream described by this OPID, with the exception of
      nal_ref_idc value 3 that is valid for and is part of all sub-
      bitstreams.

10.2.  H.264 SVC

   This document specifies the usage of multiple, simultaneous codec
   operation points and therefore maps well to scalable video coding.
   Scalable video coding such as H.264 SVC (Annex G) [H264] uses three
   scalability dimensions: temporal, spatial, and quality.  It also
   includes the possibility to use redundant encodings and priority
   among sub-streams.

   The ID SHALL be considered describing an SVC sub-bitstream, which is
   defined in G.3.59 of H.264 [H264] and corresponding RTP payload

   COP messages are binary encoded.  However, in the following examples,
   all COP messages are for clarity listed in symbolic, pseudo-code
   form, where only COP message fields of interest to the example are
   included, along with the COP parameters.

11.1.  SDP Offer/Answer

   The SDP capabilities for COP are defined as receiver capabilities,
   meaning that there is no explicit indication what COP messages an
   endpoint will use in the send direction.  It is however reasonable to
   expect that an endpoint can also send the same messages that it can
   understand and act on when received.  This is assumed in all the SDP

   Note that the offer contains two different video payload types, and
   that the COP parameters differ between them, meaning that the
   possibility for codec configuration also differ.  In this case, the
   MPEG-1 codec can control both framerate and image size, but for H.261
   only the framerate can be controlled.

11.2.  Dynamic Video Re-sizing

   In this example, two COP-enabled endpoints communicate in an audio/
   video session.  The receiving endpoint has a graphical user interface
   that can be dynamically changed by the user.  This user interaction
   includes the ability to change the size of the receiving video
   window, which is also indicated in the previous SDP example
   (Section 11.1).

   At some point during the established communication, a notification
   about current video stream codec operation point is sent to the
   resizable window endpoint that receives the video stream.
                  COPN {SSRC:123456, OPID:123, Version:5,
                        bitrate(max):325000,
                        token-bucket(exact):1000,
                        framerate(exact):15,
                        hor-size(exact):320,
                        ver-size(exact):240}

                      Figure 22: COPN for QVGA 15 Hz

   Some time later the user of the resizable window endpoint reduces the
   size of the video window.  As a result of the resize operation, the
   video window can no longer make full use of the received video
   resolution, wasting bandwidth and decoder processing resources.  The
   resizable window endpoint thus decides to notify the video stream
   sender about the changed conditions by sending a request for a video
   stream of smaller size:

Internet-Draft                     COP                      October 2012


                  COPR {SSRC:123456, OPID:123, Version:5,
                        hor-size(target):243,
                        ver-size(target):185}

                        Figure 23: COPR for 243x185

   The COPR refers to the previously received COPN with the same OPID
   and Version, and thus need only list parameters that need be changed.
   The request could arguably contain also other parameters that are
   potentially affected by the spatial resolution, such as the bitrate,
   but that can be omitted since the media sender is not slaved to the
   request but is allowed to make it's own decisions based on the
   request.

   The request sender has chosen to use target type values instead of an
   exact value for the horizontal and vertical sizes, which can be
   interpreted as "anything sufficiently similar is acceptable".  The
   target values is in this example chosen to correspond exactly to the
   resized video display area.  Many video coding algorithms operate
   most efficiently when the image size is some even multiple, and this
   way of expressing the request explicitly leaves room for the media
   sender to take such aspect into account.

   The media sender (COPR receiver) responds with the following:
      COPS {SSRC:123456, OPID:123, Version:5,
            Partial Success,
            One or more parameter values in the request were changed}

      COPN {SSRC:123456, OPID:123, Version:6,
            bitrate(max):240000,
            token-bucket(exact):1000,
            framerate(exact):15,
            hor-size(exact):240,
            ver-size(exact):176}

               Figure 24: COPS and COPN for partial success

   It can be noted that the updated COPN (version 6) indicates that the
   media sender has, in addition to reducing the video horizontal and
   vertical size, chosen to also reduce the bitrate.  This bitrate
   reduction was not in the request, but is a reasonable decision taken
   by the media sender.  It can also be seen that the horizontal and
   vertical sizes are not chosen identical to the request, but is in
   fact adjusted to be even multiples of 16, which is a local
   restriction of the fictitious video encoder in this example.  To
   handle the mismatch of the request and the resulting video stream,
   the video receiver can perform some local action such as for example
   automatic readjustment of the resized window, image scaling (possibly

   combined with cropping), or padding.

11.3.  Illegal Request

   In this example, the sent request is asking the media sender to go
   beyond what is negotiated in the SDP.  The SDP Offer below indicates
   to use video with H.264 Constrained Baseline Profile at level 1.1.

            Figure 26: COP message exchange indicating failure

   The failure above is due to a combination of frame size and frame
   rate that exceeds H.264 level 1.1, which would thus exceed the limits
   established by SDP Offer/Answer.  The maximum permitted framerate for
   352x288 pixels (CIF) is 7.6 Hz for H.264 level 1.1, as defined in
   Annex A of [H264].

11.4.  Reference Response to Modification of Scalable Layer

   When scalable coding is used, each layer correspond to a codec
   operation point.  A media receiver can thus target a request towards
   a single layer.  Assume a video encoding with three framerate layers,
   announced in a (multiple operation point) notification as:

   but ID should be defined in a codec-specific way that makes it
   possible to identify the layer directly in the media stream.  If the
   corresponding OPID is needed, for example to attempt another request
   targeting that, it can be found by searching the active set of COPN
   for matching ID values.

11.5.  Successful Request to Add Codec Operation Point

   In this example, the media receiver is receiving a non-scalable
   stream from a codec that can support scalability, and wishes to add a
   scalability layer.  Assume the existing OPID from the media sender is
   announced as:
                    COPN {SSRC:3492, OPID:4, Version:2,
                          bitrate(exact):350000,
                          token-bucket(exact):600,

                          hor-size(exact):320,
                          ver-size(exact):240}

                Figure 30: COPN with single operation point

   The media receiver constructs a request for multiple streams by
   including multiple requests for different OPID.  Since the new stream
   does not exist, it has no OPID from the media sender and the receiver
   chooses a random value as reference and indicates that it is a new,
   temporary OPID.  The request for the new stream includes all
   parameters that the media receiver has an opinion on, and leaves the
   other parameters to be chosen by the media sender.  In this case it
   is a request for identical frame size and doubled framerate.

             Figure 31: COPR requesting to add operation point

   The media sender decides it can start layered encoding with the
   requested parameters.  The status response to the new OPID contains a
   reference to an ID that is included as part of the matching,
   subsequent COPN.  Note that since both the original and the new
   streams are now part of a scalable set, they must both be identified
   with ID parameters to be able to distinguish between them.  The media
   sender has chosen an OPID for the new stream in the COPN, which need
   not be identical to the temporary one in the request, but the new
   stream can anyway be uniquely identified through the ID that is
   announced in both the COPS and COPN.

   Note that since the ID has a defined relation to the media sub-stream
   identification, decoding of that new sub-stream can start immediately
   after receiving the COPS.  It may however not be possible to describe
   the new stream in COP parameter terms until the COPN is received
   (depending on COP parameter visibility directly in the media stream).

12.  IANA Considerations

   Following the guidelines in [RFC4566], in [RFC4585], and in
   [RFC3550], the IANA is requested to register:

   1.  The 'cop' tag to be used with ccm under rtcp-fb AVPF attribute in
       SDP.

   2.  The FMT number TBA1 to be allocated to the COP feedback message
       from this specification.

   3.  A registry listing registered values for 'cop' message item type,
       with initial values from Table 1.

   4.  A registry listing registered values and tag names for 'cop'
       parameter type, with initial values from Table 4.


13.  Security Considerations

   This document extends the CCM [RFC5104] and defines new messages,
   i.e.  COPR, COPN and COPS.  The exchange of these new messages MAY
   have some security implications, which need to be addressed by the
   user.  Following are some important implications,

   1.  Identity spoofing - An attacker can spoof him/herself as an
       authenticated user and can falsely control or indicate the codec
       parameters of any source transmission.  In order to prevent this
       type of attack, a strong authentication and integrity protection
       mechanism is needed.

   2.  Denial of Service (DoS) - An attacker can falsely set codec
       parameters for all the source streams which MAY result in Denial
       of Service (DoS).  An Authentication protocol MAY save from this
       attack.

   3.  Man-in-Middle Attack (MiMT) - The codec configuration and
       notification of changes of the RTP source is prone to a Man-in-
       Middle attack.  The public key authentication May be used to
       prevent MiMT.


14.  Open Issues

   There is currently no defined way for a media receiver to indicate
   that it wants to release the restrictions it previously had on an
   operation point, if the media stream contains only a single operation
   point.
