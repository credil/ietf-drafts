1.  Introduction

   During discussions on how to add DANE [RFC6698] technology to new
   protocols/services people repeatedly have got confused as what the
   numeric values stand for and even the order of the fields of a TLSA
   record.  This document updates the IANA registry definition for TLSA
   record to add a column with acronym for each specified field, in
   order to reduce confusion.  This document does not change the DANE
   protocol in any way.

   It is expected that DANE parser's in applications and DNS software
   MAY adopt parsing the acronyms for each field, installed base MAY NOT
   get updated.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  IANA considerations

   This document applies to "DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities
   (DANE) Parameters" located at "http://www.iana.org/assignments/dane-
   parameters/dane-parameters.xhtml".  Each one of the Sub-registries
   will add a column with an acronym for that field.

   [RFC6698] and this document are both to be reference documents for
   the three sub-registries.

3.  Security considerations

   None, this document only changes registry fields and does not change
   the behavior of any protocol.  The hope is to reduce confusion and
   lead to better specification and operations.
