      "From" and other Message Header Fields as SPF Policy Scopes
                       draft-mehnle-spf-scope-00

Abstract

   This document defines a new modifier for the SPF e-mail
   authentication protocol allowing the SPF record for a domain to be
   declared as being applicable to message identities other than the
   MAIL FROM identity, such as the "From" or "Sender" message header
   identities.

Internet-Draft           Extended Scopes for SPF           December 2011


1.  Introduction

   Sender Policy Framework (SPF) [RFC4408] was designed to prevent the
   unauthorized use of domain names in the reverse-path of e-mail
   messages (also known as the envelope sender or MAIL FROM identity).
   However, the reverse-path is used purely for message transport
   purposes and in practice is never exposed to the end user, so SPF
   cannot protect against typical forms of address spoofing targeting
   user visible identities such as the "From" message header field.

   Sender ID [RFC4406] was designed to overcome this limitation of SPF
   by defining an artificial identity named Purported Responsible
   Address (PRA) [RFC4407] based on one of the "From", "Sender",
   "Resent-From", and "Resent-Sender" message header fields [RFC5322].
   The algorithm underlying the PRA definition was intended to select
   the identity representing the entity responsible for the message's
   most recent injection into the mail system.  The "Resent-From" and
   "Resent-Sender" fields, however, too, are rarely exposed to the end
   user, so by taking these into consideration PRA-based Sender ID
   policies open themselves up to attacks where the "From" header
   address is spoofed and a "Resent-From" or "Resent-Sender" field is
   added -- typically invisible to the end user -- with an unrelated
   (usually unprotected) address.

   This document defines a new "scope" modifier, as provided by Section
   6 of [RFC4408], for use in SPF "v=spf1" policies.  Policies that
   include a "scope" modifier may be used to authenticate message
   identities other than the HELO or MAIL FROM identities defined by
   [RFC4408], such as the "From" or "Sender" message header identities.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

1.1.1.  Requirements Notation

   This document occasionally uses terms that appear in capital letters.
   When the terms "MUST", "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD
   NOT", and "MAY" appear capitalized, they are being used to indicate
   particular requirements of this specification.  A discussion of the
   meanings of these terms appears in [RFC2119].

1.1.2.  Syntactic Notation

   This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   [RFC5234] notation for formal syntax definitions.  Characters will be
   specified either by a decimal value (e.g., the value %d65 for
   uppercase A and %d97 for lowercase A) or by a case-insensitive
   literal value enclosed in quotation marks (e.g., "A" for either
   uppercase or lowercase A).

2.  Supported Message Identities

   The "scope" modifier allows a domain owner to specify a set of
   message identities to which a domain's SPF policy may be applied in
   addition to the default HELO and MAIL FROM identities to which all
   "v=spf1" policies may be applied.  This section defines the
   identities that may be specified as part of a "scope" modifier.
   Other documents may define additional identities.

2.1.  The "From" Header Identity

   Per Section 3.6.2 of [RFC5322] a typical e-mail message includes a
   single "From" header field containing a single mailbox specification
   indicating the mailbox of the person or system responsible for
   authoring the message.  The addr-spec part (Section 3.4 of [RFC5322])
   of that mailbox constitutes the "From" header identity of such a
   message.

   A message's "From" header field may contain more than one mailbox
   specification if the message was authored by multiple persons.  Such
   a message has multiple "From" header identities.

   A message with zero "From" header fields is invalid per [RFC5322].
   Such a messages has no "From" header identity.

   A message with more than one "From" header field is invalid per
   [RFC5322], however in order to prevent the display or other use of
   unintentionally unauthenticated identities from such a message it is
   RECOMMENDED that in this case implementations of this specification
   treat all the mailbox specifications in all the "From" header fields
   as multiple "From" header identities for the purposes of this
   document.

2.2.  The "Sender" Header Identity

   Per Section 3.6.2 of [RFC5322] an e-mail message may include a single
   "Sender" header field containing a single mailbox specification
   indicating the mailbox of the person or system responsible for
   originally sending the message.  The addr-spec part (Section 3.4 of
   [RFC5322]) of that mailbox constitutes the "Sender" header identity
   of such a message.

   A message with zero "Sender" header fields is assumed to have been
   sent by its author, as specified by a single "From" header field with
   a single mailbox specification.  Such a message's "Sender" header
   identity is its "From" header identity.

   A message with zero "Sender" header fields and multiple "From" header

   identities (as multiple mailbox specifications in a single or in
   multiple "From" header field(s)) is invalid per [RFC5322], however in
   order to prevent the display or other use of unintentionally
   unauthenticated identities from such a message it is RECOMMENDED that
   in this case implementations treat multiple "From" header identities
   as multiple "Sender" header identities for the purposes of this
   document.

   A message with a single "Sender" header field containing multiple
   mailbox specifications or with more than one "Sender" header field is
   invalid per [RFC5322], however it is RECOMMENDED that in this case
   implementations treat all the mailbox specifications in all the
   "Sender" header fields as multiple "Sender" header identities for the
   purposes of this document.


3.  The "scope" modifier

3.1.  Syntax

   This document defines a new modifier named "scope" for use in SPF
   "v=spf1" policies as provided by Section 6 of [RFC4408].  The grammar
   is as follows:

        mod-scope = "scope" "=" scope-ids

        scope-ids = scope-id *( "," scope-id )

        scope-id  = "hdr-from" / "hdr-sender" / name

   An SPF policy may contain at most one "scope" modifier; an
   implementation encountering more than one "scope" modifier in a
   policy MUST generate a "PermError" result.  The single "scope"
   modifier MAY occur anywhere in the record after the initial "v=spf1",
   however it is RECOMMENDED that it be inserted immediately after the
   initial "v=spf1" to make it clear that the semantics associated with
   it apply to the entire policy; of course this is always the case,
   even if the "scope" modifier occurs in a different position.

   <scope-id> values are defined as follows:

               +------------+------------------------------+
               | Identity   | Defined in                   |
               +------------+------------------------------+
               | hdr-from   | Section 2.1 of this document |
               | hdr-sender | Section 2.2 of this document |
               +------------+------------------------------+

   For example, the SPF record

            v=spf1 scope=hdr-from ip4:192.168.0.101 -all

   defines a sender policy that may be used to authenticate "From"
   header identities in messages.

3.2.  Semantics

   An SPF policy that includes a "scope" modifier may be used to
   authenticate the message identities specified as a separated list of
   <scope-id>s in the modifier value.  The set of identities listed is
   said to be the (extended) scope of the policy.  A supported identity
   is said to be "in scope" of a policy if it is listed in the policy's
   scope modifier.

   Authentication of a supported, in-scope message identity against an
   SPF policy is done by applying the check_host() function defined in
   Section 4 of [RFC4408], passing the identity as the <sender> argument
   and its domain portion as the <domain> argument.

   When authenticating a certain type of identity in a given message and
   the message does not contain any instances of that identity, there is
   nothing to authenticate.

   When authenticating a certain type of identity in a given message and
   the message contains multiple distinct instances of that identity,
   the result of each check applies only to a single distinct instance
   of the identity.  It is RECOMMENDED that an implementation check all
   the instances of a type of identity that it chooses to authenticate.
   Then, for example, individual identity instances may be marked
   according to their results when displaying the message to the end
   user, or an aggregate result may be derived from the individual
   results.  The precise behavior is not defined by this document except
   that, for a given message, all instances of a given identity type
   MUST be treated according to the same rules.  Implementations MUST
   NOT simply select one of them as "the" identity of that type.

   NOTE: The support of modifiers defined by specifications other than
   the base SPF specification is generally optional and domain owners
   should be aware that their "v=spf1" policies will be used by
   receivers to authenticate the default HELO and MAIL FROM identities
   defined by [RFC4408]; there is no way to prevent that. "v=spf1"
   policies with a "scope" modifier published with the primary intent of
   allowing the authentication of non-HELO, non-MAIL-FROM identities
   should be constructed in such a way that legitimate messages sent
   with relevant HELO or MAIL FROM identities will not unexpectedly fail
   authentication of these identities.
