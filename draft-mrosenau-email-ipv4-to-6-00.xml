    <abstract>
        <t>During the introduction phase of IPv6 (as of
        Jan 2013) many existing mail servers are not
        able to do IPv6 communication, yet. However new
        networks will be assigned IPv6 addresses only
        so new mail servers will not be able to do
        IPv4 communication.</t>
        <t>This document proposes the installation of
        special servers that are able to route mail
        between IPv4-only and IPv6-only mail servers
        to solve this problem.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Background">
        <t>As of the end 2012 IPv4 addresses are no
        longer available to companies. For this reason
        new mail servers (especially mail servers of
        companies that do not have IPv4 addresses, yet)
        are IPv6-only. The introcuction of IPv6 on
        existing mail servers, however, is often not
        done right now.</t>
        <t>RFC 3974
        proposes that every mail server should have
        an IPv4 address even if it is able to do IPv6.
        However this is no longer possible due to the
        depletion of IPv4 addresses.</t>
        <t>For this reason it may be impossible to send
        an electronic mail from a domain that has an
        IPv4-only server to a domain using an IPv6-only
        server and vice versa.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Implementation">
      <section title="Tunnel servers">
        <t>This document proposes the installation of
        IPv4-to-IPv6 translation servers to manage the
        problem. Such a server would work the following
        way:
        <list style="symbols">
            <t>Accept incoming SMTP connections on
            IPv4 AND IPv6</t>
            <t>For each mail "received" simply forward
            the received mail to the SMTP server that
            is really responsible for the destination
            address</t>
        </list></t>
        <t>In our example such servers have the
        addresses 192.0.1.30 and 192.0.1.31. The DNS
        configuration may look like this:</t>
        <figure><artwork>
      example.org.            IN MX   1  mx1.example.org.
      example.com.            IN MX   1  mx1.example.com.
      ip4only.example.        IN MX   1  mx1.ip4only.example.
      mail-tunnel.example.    IN AAAA 2001:db8:ffff::1
      mail-tunnel.example.    IN AAAA 2001:db8:ffff::2
      mail-tunnel.example.    IN A    192.0.1.30
      mail-tunnel.example.    IN A    192.0.1.31
      mx1.example.org.        IN AAAA 2001:db8:ffff::1:1
      mx1.example.org.        IN A    192.0.1.30
      mx1.example.org.        IN A    192.0.1.31
      mx1.example.com.        IN AAAA 2001:db8:ffff::2:1
      mx1.example.com.        IN A    192.0.1.30
      mx1.example.com.        IN A    192.0.1.31
      mx1.ip4only.example.    IN A    192.0.2.1
        </artwork></figure>
        <t>Note that mx1.example.com and mx1.example.org
        are different (!) servers. However the IPv4
        address in the DNS configuration is the same.
        The DNS query for their IPv4 address will result
        in the IPv4 address of the server
        "mail-tunnel.example" because they do not support
        IPv4.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="IPv4-to-IPv6 mail transport">
        <t>Scenario: An Email is sent from
        example@ip4only.example to example@example.com.
        </t>
        <t>The mail server of the domain ip4only.example
        will now query the IPv4 address of mx1.example.com.
        The DNS server will return the address 192.0.1.30
        which is in fact the address of the tunnel server.
        </t>
        <t>The mail is now delivered to the tunnel server,
        that then forwards the mail to the actual mail
        server.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="IPv6-to-IPv4 mail transport">
        <t>Scenario: An Email is sent from
        example@example.com to example@ipv4only.example.
        </t>
        <t>The mail server of the domain example.com
        will now query the IPv6 address of mx1.ipv4only.example.
        The DNS server will return no result.
        </t>
        <t>In this case the mail server's implementation must
        be done in a way to allow transmission to IPv4-only
        domains: It must detect this case and directly
        connect the tunnel server or use other tunneling
        mechanisms that allow connecting the
        IPv4 mail server using a TCP connection from
        an IPv6-only network directly (like NAT64).</t>
        <t>Note: If an IPv6 mail server has access to
        NAT64 and DNS64 it can send mail directly to
        an IPv4 mail server</t>
