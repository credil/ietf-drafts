   Also, these procedures do not take into account operator functions 
   such Lock Instruct and Loopback introduced as part of MPLS Transport 
   Profile (MPLS-TP). This informational document reiterates stitching 
   procedures for static PW taking into account all the new proposed 
   extensions.  

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task

1. Introduction 

   The PWE3 Architecture in [1] defines signaling and encapsulation   
   techniques for establishing Single Segment PW (SS-PW) between a pair   
   of terminating PEs. Procedures for stitching two or more static or   
   dynamic SS-PWs to form Multi-Segment PW (MS-PW) are described in [2]. 
 
 
Sivabalan              Expires January 1, 2012                 [Page 2] 
                                                     
Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-pwe3-mpls-tp-ms-pw-00.txt         July 2011 
    

   These procedures make use of PW status messages carried in LDP TLV   
   over dynamic PW established via LDP. [3] defines a new PW status OAM   
   message used to carry PW status in-band over static PW. This message   
   makes it possible to exchange PW status end-to-end over a MS-PW   
   consisting of one or more static PW. 

   [5] specifies operator new Operation, Administration, and Maintenance   
   (OAM) functions Lock Instruct (LI) and Loopback (LB) for associated   
   bi-directional circuits such as MPLS-TP LSP, SS-PW, and MS-PW in an   
   MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) environment. These functions enable   
   network operators to lock a circuit (LSP and PW) and operate it in 
   loopback mode for testing/management purpose.  

   This informational document describes the application of the existing   
   PW stitching procedures taking into consideration LI, LB, as well as   
   PW status OAM messages.

3.  Operation 

   In this section, we explain the use of LI/LB mechanisms referring   
   to the MS-PW model shown in Figure 1. The SS-PW segments PW1 and PW2   
   can be either static or dynamic. We assume that PWs are carried over   
   MPLS-TP LSPs (transport LSPs) so that LI/LB mechanisms can be applied   
   at the transport LSP level, as well we consider the application of   
   LI/LB at PW level. 

   PW status is sent via LDP message and PW OAM message respectively   
   over dynamic and static PW segments. Note that even though only two   
   PW segments are considered in the examples below, the described   
   procedures are applicable to MS-PWs with more than two segments.

3.1. Lock Operation 

3.1.1. Locking MPLS-TP LSP 

   An MPLS-TP LSP can be taken out of service for maintenance operation   
   using the LI mechanism described in [5]. LI messages are exchanged   
   between MPLS-TP Maintenance End Points (MEPs). In the case of MS-PW,   
   each MPLS-TP LSP associated with a given PW segment can be   
   individually locked for management purpose. This means that, in a MS-   
   PW scenario, a T-PE is always a MEP and an S-PE is a MEP for an MPLS-
   TP LSP carrying PW segments. Furthermore, a T-PE   (MEP) assumes that 
   an MPLS-TP LSP is successfully locked only when   the corresponding 
   LI reply is received from the other intended   receiver MEP (other T-
   PE or S-PE).  

3.1.1.1. LI originated at T-PE 

   Assume that T-PE1 originates an LI request for the MPLS-TP LSP 
   carrying PW1. The intended recipient of the message will be the S-PE. 
   When T-PE1 receives a positive LI reply from the S-PE, it assumes 
   that the MPLS-TP LSP is successfully locked, and takes PW1 and all 
   other PWs associated with the MPLS-TP LSP out of service. This means 
   that PW1 and all other impacted PWs will no longer carry user data. 

   When S-PE receives an LI request, if the intended MPLS-TP LSP can be 
   locked, the S-PE finds all PWs associated with this MPLS-TP LSP and 
   first sends the PW status code 0x00000018 (Local PSN-facing PW 
   Receive/Transmit Faults) on all stitched PWs segments to T-PE2. PW 
   status code is sent over PW OAM message or LDP message depending on 
   whether the segment PW2 is static or dynamic. After sending the PW 
   status code to T-PE2, S-PE lock the MPLS-TP LSP and sends a positive 
   LI reply to T-PE1. If the MPLS-TP LSP cannot be locked, S-PE sends a 
   negative LI reply with the appropriate error code to T-PE1. 

   When T-PE2 receives the PW status codes, it processes them as   
   described in [3] or [4] depending on whether PW2 is dynamic or   
   static. 

   If PW2 is a dynamic segment and does not support PW status, S-PE   
   needs to withdraw its labels from T-PE2 before locking the MPLS LSP. 

   For better scalability, S-PE may use the notion of group ID described   
   in [6] to send PW status or withdraw labels all impacted dynamic PWs   
   between itself and T-PE2. Use of group ID with PW status OAM over   
   static PW is TBD.

3.1.1.2. LI originated at S-PE 

   Let's assume that an operator wants to originate an LI request at S-   
   PE for the MPLS-TP LSP carrying PW1. The intended recipient of the LI   
   request is T-PE1. First, S-PE sends PW status code 0x00000018 (Local   
   PSN-facing PW Receive/Transmit Fault) for PW1 as well as all other 
   PWs pinned down to MPLS-TP LSP in question to T-PE1 and PW2 and all 
   other stitched PWs other segments to T-PE2. PW status code   is sent 
   over PW OAM message or LDP message depending on whether the   segment 
   PW2 is static or dynamic. When T-PE2 receives the PW status   codes, 
   it processes them as described in [3] or [4] respectively   depending 
   on whether PW2 is dynamic or static. It then sends LI   request 
   message to T-PE1. If T-PE1 can successfully lock the MPLS   LSP, it 
   sends a positive LI response. Upon receiving the response, S-   PE1 
   assumes that the MPLS-TP LSP is locked, and PW1 is no longer used   
   for carrying regular user data. 

   If T-PE1 is unable to lock the MPLS-TP LSP, it sends a negative LI   
   response with the appropriate error code. In this case, S-PE sends PW   
   status 0x00000000 to T-PE1 and T-PE2 so that services on PW1 and PW2 
   and all other PWs associated with the MPLS-TP LSP in question can 
   resume. 

   If PW2 is a dynamic segment and PW status, S-PE needs to withdraw its   
   labels from T-PE1 and T-PE2 before sending LI request to T-PE1. 

   For better scalability, S-PE may use the notion of group ID described   
   in [6] to send PW status or withdraw labels all impacted dynamic PWs. 

   Use of group ID with PW status OAM over static PW is TBD.  

    

3.1.2. Locking PW 

   A given PW can also be taken out of service for maintenance operation   
   without impacting services over other PWs using the LI mechanism   
   described in [5].  

3.1.2.1. LI originated at T-PE 

   In our example, let's assume that, T-PE1 sends an LI request message   
   to lock PW1. S-PE is the intended recipient (based on the TTL value 
   of the PW label).If S-PE is able to lock PW1, it sends a PW status 
   message with the status code 0x00000018 (Local PSN-facing PW 
   Receive/Transmit Fault) over PW2 to T-PE2, and locks PW1. S-PE then 
   sends a positive LI reply to T-PE1. Upon receiving the positive LI

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-pwe3-mpls-tp-ms-pw-00.txt         July 2011 
    

   reply, T-PE locks PW1. If S-PE is unable to lock PW1, it sends a 
   negative LI reply to T-PE1. PW status code is sent over PW OAM 
   message or LDP message depending on whether the segment PW2 is static   
   or dynamic. When T-PE2 receives the PW status codes, it processes   
   them as described in [3] or [4] depending on whether PW2 is dynamic   
   or static. 

   . 

3.2. Loopback Operation 

3.2.1. As described in [5], an MPLS-TP LSP or a PW can be setup to in   
   loopback mode for management purpose, e.g., to test or verify   
   connectivity of the LSP/PW up to a specific node on the path of the   
   MPLS-TP tunnel/PW, and to test the LSP/PW performance with respect to   
   delay/jitter, etc. But, prior to operating in loopback mode, an MPLS-   
   TP LSP or PW must be successfully locked. Loopback at MPLS-TP LSP 
   Level 

   Assume that an operator wants to operate an MPLS-TP LSP between T-PE1   
   and S-PE carrying PW1 in loopback mode such that S-PE loops all the   
   incoming packets over the MPLS-TP LSP back to the sender (in this   
   case T-PE1). 

   T-PE1 sends an LB request message which is received by S-PE. S-PE can   
   setup the MPLS-TP LSP only if all the PWs carried over that LSP can   
   be setup in loopback mode. If S-PE can setup the MPLS-TP tunnel in   
   loopback mode, it sends a positive LB response. Otherwise, it sends a   
   negative LB response to T-PE1. 

   If the MPLS-TP LSP is successfully setup in loopback mode, all   
   incoming packets over PW1 will be looped back to T-PE1. This is also   
   true for any other PW(s) between T-PE1 and S-PE pinned down to the   
   MPLS-TP LSP in question. 

   Similarly, MPLS-TP LSP between S-PE and T-PE1 can be operated in   
   loopback mode such that T-PE1 loops all incoming packets over the LSP   
   back to S-PE. In this case, S-PE and T-PE1 respectively are sender   
   and receiver of the LB request message. 

3.2.2. Loopback at PW Level 

   A SS-PW or MS-PW can be operated in loopback mode. 

   In our example, let's assume that PW1 is to be operated in a loopback   
   mode such that S-PE loops all incoming packets over PW1 back to T-   
   PE1. To setup this mode of operation, T-PE1 sends an LB request   
 
 
Sivabalan              Expires January 1, 2012                 [Page 7] 
                                                     
Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-pwe3-mpls-tp-ms-pw-00.txt         July 2011 
    

   message to S-PE. TTL value of the PW label is chosen so as to expire   
   on the intended recipient (in our example TTL value should be 1 so   
   that LB request can be processed at S-PE). If S-PE can successfully   
   setup PW1 in loopback mode, it sends a positive LB response to T-PE1. 

   If loopback operation over the entire MS-PW (i.e., over PW1 and PW2)   
   such that T-PE2 loops all the incoming packets over PW2 back to T-   
   PE1, T-PE1 and T-PE2 will be the sender and receiver of LB message. 

3.3. Switching Point PE TLV 

   Switching Point PE TLV (S-PE TLV) is used to record information about   
   S-PE(s) that a PW traverses. An S-PE TLV contains many sub-TLVs as   
   described in [3]. One such sub-TLV carries the FEC of the last   
   traversed PW segment. 

   In the case of MS-PW containing static PW segment(s), if the last   
   traversed PW segment is statically provisioned, a new sub-TLV   
   containing the FEC defined for static PW in [7] can be used to   
   represent the last traversed PW segment. The new sub-TLV type will be   
   defined in [4]. 

3.4. LSP-Ping/Trace 

   TBD 

   
4. Security Considerations 

   This document does not introduce any additional security constraints. 

5. IANA Considerations
