    <abstract>
      <t>Discovery of the Path Computation Element (PCE) within an IGP area or
      routing domain is possible using OSPF [RFC5088] and IS-IS [RFC5089].
      However, it has been established that in certain deployment scenarios
      PCEs may not wish, or be able to participate within the IGP process. In
      those scenarios, it is beneficial for the Path Computation Client (PCC)
      (or other PCE) to discover PCEs via an alternative mechanism to those
      proposed in [RFC5088] and [RFC5089].</t>

      <t>This document specifies the requirements, use cases, procedures and
      extensions to support PCE type and capability discovery via DNS.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) is a
      transaction-based protocol carried over TCP [RFC4655]. In order to be
      able to direct path computation requests to the Path Computation Element
      (PCE), a Path Computation Client (PCC) (or other PCE) needs to know the
      location and capability of a PCE.</t>

      <t>In a network where an IGP is used and where the PCE participates in
      the IGP, discovery mechanisms exist for PCC (or PCE) to learn the
      identity and capability of each PCE. [RFC5088] defines a PCE Discovery
      (PCED) TLV carried in an OSPF Router LSA. Similarly, [RFC5089] defines
      the PCED sub-TLV for use in PCE Discovery using IS-IS. Scope of the
      advertisement is limited to IGP area/level or Autonomous System
      (AS).</t>

      <t>However in certain scenarios not all PCEs will participate in the IGP
      instance, section 3 (Motivation) outlines a number of use cases. In
      these cases, current PCE Discovery mechanisms are therefore not
      appropriate and another PCE discovery function would be required.</t>

      <t>This document describes PCE discovery via DNS. The mechanism with
      which DNS comes to know about the PCE and its capability is out of scope
      of this document.</t>

      <section title="Terminology" toc="default">
        <t>The following terminology is used in this document.</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="PCE-Domain:">As per <xref target="RFC4655"></xref>,
            any collection of network elements within a common sphere of
            address management or path computational responsibility. Examples
            of domains include Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) areas and
            Autonomous Systems (ASs).</t>

            <t hangText="Domain-Name:">An identification string that defines a
            realm of administrative autonomy, authority, or control on the
            Internet. Any name registered in the DNS is a domain name. DNS
            Domain names are used in various networking contexts and
            application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a
            domain name represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource.
            Examples of DNS domain name is “www.example.com” or
            “example.com”[RFC1035].</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Requirements">
        <t>As described in [RFC4674], the PCE Discovery information should at
        least be composed of: <list style="symbols">
            <t>The PCE location: an IPv4 and/or IPv6 address that is used to
            reach the PCE. It is RECOMMENDED to use an address that is always
            reachable if there is any connectivity to the PCE;</t>

            <t>The PCE path computation scope (i.e., inter-area, inter-AS, or
            inter-layer);</t>

            <t>The set of one or more PCE-Domain(s) into which the PCE has
            visibility and for which the PCE can compute paths;</t>

            <t>The set of zero, one, or more neighbor PCE-Domain(s) toward
            which the PCE can compute paths;</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>These PCE discovery information allows PCCs to select appropriate
        PCEs:</t>

        <t>This document specifies the procedures and extension to facilitate
        DNS-based PCE information discovery for specific use cases, and to

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119">RFC2119</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Motivation">
      <t>This section discusses in more detail the motivation and use cases
      for an alternative DNS-based PCE discovery mechanism.</t>

      <section title="Outside the Routing Domain">
        <t>When the PCE is a router participating in the IGP, or even a server
        participating passively in the IGP, with all PCEP speakers in the same
        routing domain, a simple and efficient way to announce PCEs consists
        of using IGP flooding.</t>

        <t>It has been identified that the existing PCE discovery mechanisms
        do not work in following scenarios:</t>

        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Inter-AS:">Per domain path computation mechanism
            [RFC5152] or Backward recursive path computation (BRPC) [RFC5441]
            MAY be used by cooperating PCEs to compute inter-domain path. In
            which case these cooperating PCEs should be known to other PCEs.
            In case of inter-AS where the PCEs do not participate in a common
            IGP, the existing IGP discovery mechanism cannot be used to
            discover inter-AS PCE.</t>

            <t hangText="Hierarchy of PCE:">The H-PCE [RFC6805] architecture
            does not require disclosure of internals of a child domain to the
            parent PCE. It may be necessary for a third party to manage the
            parent PCEs according to commercial and policy agreements from
            each of the participating service providers [PCE-QUESTION]. <xref
            target="RFC6805"></xref> specifies that a child PCE must be
            configured with the address of its parent PCE in order for it to
            interact with its parent PCE. However handling changes in parent
            PCE identities and coping with failure events would be an issue
            for a configured system. There is no scope for parent PCEs to
            advertise their presence to child PCEs when they are not a part of
            the same routing domain.</t>

            <t hangText="BGP:">[BGP-LS] describes a mechanism by which links
            state and traffic engineering information can be collected from
            networks and shared with external components using the BGP routing
            protocol. An external PCE MAY use this mechanism to populate its
            TED and not take part in the same IGP routing domain.</t>

            <t hangText="NMS/OSS:">PCE MAY gain the knowledge of Topology
            information from some management system (e.g.,NMS/OSS) and not
            take part in the same routing domain. Also note that in some case
            PCC may not be a router and instead be a management system like
            NMS and may not be able to discover PCE via IGP discovery.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Discovery Mechanisms">
        <section title="Query-Response versus Advertisement">
          <t>Advertisement based PCE discovery using IGP methods [RFC5088] and
          [RFC5089] floods the PCE information to an area, a subset of areas
          or to a full routing domain. By the very nature of flooding and
          advertisements it generates unwanted traffic and may lead to
          unnecessary advertisement, especially when PCE information needs
          frequent changes.</t>

          <t>DNS is a query-response based mechanism, a client (a PCC) can use
          DNS to discover a PCE only when it needs to compute a path and does
          not require any other node in the network to be involved.</t>

          <t>In case of Intermittent PCEP session, where PCEP sessions are
          systematically open and closed for each PCEP request, a DNS-based
          query-response mechanism is more suitable. One may also utilize
          DNS-based load-balancing and recovery functions.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Network Address Translation Gateway">
        <t>PCEP uses TCP as the transport mechanism between PCC and PCE, and
        PCE to PCE, communications [RFC5440]. To secure TCP connection that
        underlay PCEP sessions, Transport Layer Security (TLS) can be used
        besides using TCP-MD5 [RFC2385] and TCP-AUTH [RFC5295]. When PCC and
        PCE support TCP-MD5 or TCP-AUTH while NAT does not, TCP connection
        establishment fails. When NAT gateway is in presence, a TCP or TCP/TLS
        connection can be opened by Interactive Connectivity Establishment
        (ICE) [RFC5245] for the purpose of connectivity checks. However the
        TCP connection cannot be established in cases where one of the peers
        is behind a NAT with connection-dependent filtering properties
        [RFC5382]. Therefore IGP discovery is limited within an IGP domain and
        cannot be used in this case.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Additional Capabilities">
      <section title="Load Sharing of Path Computation Requests">
        <t>Multiple PCEs can be present in a single network domain for
        redundancy. DNS supports inherent load balancing where multiple PCEs
        (with different IP addresses) are known in DNS for a single PCE server
        name and are hidden from the PCC.</t>

        <t>In an IGP advertisement based PCE discovery, one learns of all the
        PCEs and it is the job of the PCC to do load-balancing.</t>

        <t>A DNS-based load-balancing mechanism works well in case of
        Intermittent PCEP sessions and request are load-balanced among PCEs
        similar to HTTP request without any complexity at the client.</t>

    <section title="Extended Naming Authority Pointer ( NAPTR )Service Field Format">
      <t>The NAPTR service field format defined by the S-NAPTR DDDS
      application in [RFC3958] follows this Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
      [RFC5234]: <figure>
          <artwork>
       service-parms = [ [app-service] *(":" app-protocol)]
       app-service   = experimental-service  / iana-registered-service
       app-protocol  = experimental-protocol / iana-registered-protocol
       experimental-service      = "x-" 1*30ALPHANUMSYM
       experimental-protocol     = "x-" 1*30ALPHANUMSYM
       iana-registered-service   = ALPHA *31ALPHANUMSYM
       iana-registered-protocol  = ALPHA *31ALPHANUMSYM
       ALPHA         =  %x41-5A / %x61-7A   ; A-Z / a-z
       DIGIT         =  %x30-39 ; 0-9
       SYM           =  %x2B / %x2D / %x2E  ; "+" / "-" / "."
       ALPHANUMSYM   =  ALPHA / DIGIT / SYM
       ; The app-service and app-protocol tags are limited to 32
       ; characters and must start with an alphabetic character.
       ; The service-parms are considered case-insensitive.
</artwork>
        </figure></t>

      <t>This specification refines the "iana-registered-service" tag
      definition for the discovery of PCE supporting a specific PCE
      application or capability as defined below. <figure>
          <artwork>
       iana-registered-service =/ pce-service
       pce-service             = "pce+ap" appln-id
       appln-id                = 1*10DIGIT
                                 ; Application Identifier expressed as
                                 ; a decimal integer without leading
                                 ; zeros.
</artwork>
        </figure></t>

      <t>The appln-id element is the Application Identifier used to identify a
      specific PCE application. The PCE Application Identifier is a 32-bit
      unsigned integer, and values are allocated by IANA as defined in section
      8.1.</t>

      <t>This specification also refines the "iana-registered-protocol" tag
      definition for the discovery of PCE supporting a specific transport
      protocol as defined below. <figure>
          <artwork>
       iana-registered-protocol =/ pce-protocol
       pce-protocol             = "pce." pce-transport
       pce-transport            = "tcp" / "tls.tcp"
</artwork>
        </figure></t>

      <t>Similar to application protocol tags defined in the [RFC6408],the
      S-NAPTR application protocol tags defined by this specification MUST NOT
      be parsed in any way by the querying application or Resolver. The
      delimiter (".") is present in the tag to improve readability and does
      not imply a structure or namespace of any kind. The choice of delimiter
      (".") for the application protocol tag follows the format of existing
      S-NAPTR application protocol tag registry entries, but this does not
      imply that it shares semantics with any other specifications that create
      registry entries with the same format.</t>

      <t>The S-NAPTR application service and application protocol tags defined
      by this specification are unrelated to the IANA "Service Name and
      Transport Protocol Port Number Registry" (see [RFC6335]).</t>

      <t>The maximum length of the NAPTR service field is 256 octets,
      including a one-octet length field (see Section 4.1 of [RFC3403] and
      Section 3.3 of [RFC1035]).</t>

      <section title="IETF Standards Track PCE Applications">
        <t>A PCE Client MUST be capable of using the extended S-NAPTR
        application service tag for dynamic discovery of a PCE supporting
        Standards Track applications. Therefore, every IETF Standards Track
        PCE application MUST be associated with a "PCE-service" tag formatted
        as defined in this specification and allocated in accordance with IANA
        policy (see Section 8).</t>

        <t>For example, a NAPTR service field value of:<figure>
            <artwork>
'PCE+ap1:pce.tcp'
</artwork>
          </figure></t>

        <t>means that the PCE in the SRV or A/AAAA record supports the Global
        Concurrent Optimization Application ('1') (See section 8.1)and the
        Transport Control Protocol (TCP) as the transport protocol (See
        section 8.2).</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Backwards Compatibility">
      <t>Domain Name System (DNS) administrators SHOULD also provision legacy
      NAPTR records [RFC3403] in order to guarantee backwards compatibility
      with legacy PCE that only support S-NAPTR DDDS application in [RFC3958].
      If the DNS administrator provisions both extended S-NAPTR records as
      defined in this specification and legacy NAPTR records defined in
      [RFC3403], then the extended S-NAPTR records MUST have higher
      priority(e.g., lower order and/or preference values) than legacy NAPTR
      records.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Discovering a Path Computation Element">
      <t>The extended-format NAPTR records provide a mapping from a domain to
      the SRV record or A/AAAA record for contacting a server supporting a
      specific transport protocol and PCE application. The resource record
      will contain an empty regular expression and a replacement value, which
      is the SRV record or the A/AAAA record for that particular transport
      protocol.</t>

      <t>The assumption for this mechanism to work is that the DNS
      administrator of the queried domain has first provisioned the DNS with
      extended-format NAPTR entries.</t>

      <t>When the PCC or other PCEs performs a NAPTR query for a server in a
      particular realm, the PCC or other PCEs has to know in advance the
      search path of the resolver, i.e.,in which realm to look for a PCE, and
      in which Application Identifier it is interested.</t>

      <t>The search path of the resolver can either be pre-configured, or
      discovered using Diameter, DHCP or other means. For example, the realm
      could be deduced from the Network Access Identifier (NAI) in the
      User-Name attribute-value pair (AVP) or extracted from the
      Destination-Realm AVP in Diameter [RFC6733].</t>

      <t>When pre-configuration is used, PCE domain(e.g.,AS200)can be added as
      "subdomains" of the first-level domain of the underlying service (e.g.,
      AS200.example.com), which allows a NAPTR query for a server in a PCE
      domain associated with DNS domain-name.</t>

      <t>When DHCP is used, it SHOULD know the domain-name of that realm and
      use DHCP to discover IP address of the PCE in that realm that provides
      path computation service along with some PCE location information useful
      to a PCC (or other PCE) for a PCE selection, and contact it directly. In
      some instances, the discovery may result in a per protocol/application
      list of domain-names that are then used as starting points for the
      subsequent S-NAPTR lookups [RFC3958]. If neither the IP address nor
      other PCE location information can be discovered with the above
      procedure, the PCC (or other PCE) MAY request a domain search list, as
      described in [RFC3397] and[RFC3646], and use it as input to the DDDS
      application.</t>

      <t>When the PCC (or other PCE) does not find valid domain-names using
      the mechanisms above, it MUST stop the attempt to discover any PCE.</t>

      <t>The following procedures result in an IP address, PCE domain,
      neighboring PCE domain and PCE Computation Scope where the PCC (or other
      PCE) can contact the PCE that hosts the service it is looking for.</t>

      <section title="Determining the PCE Service and transport protocol">
        <t>The PCC (or other PCE) should know the service identifier for the
        Path Computation service and associated transport protocol. The
        service identifier for the Path Computation service is defined as
        “PCE+apX” as specified in section 5, The PCE supporting "PCE" service
        MUST support TCP as transport, as described in [RFC5440].</t>

        <t>The services relevant for the task of transport protocol selection
        are those with S-NAPTR service fields with values "PCE+apX:Y", where
        'PCE+apX' is the service identifier defined in the previous paragraph,
        and ' Y' is the letter that corresponds to a transport protocol
        supported by the PCE. This document also establishes an IANA registry
        for mappings of S-NAPTR service name to transport protocol.</t>

        <t>These NAPTR [RFC3958] records provide a mapping from a domain to
        the SRV [RFC2782] record for contacting a PCE with the specific
        transport protocol in the S-NAPTR services field. The resource record
        MUST contain an empty regular expression and a replacement value,
        which indicates the domain name where the SRV record for that
        particular transport protocol can be found. As per [RFC3403], the
        client discards any records whose services fields are not

        <t>The PCC (or other PCE) MUST discard any service fields that

        the most preferred PCE that is supported by the client, as well as an

        entry to a target host using the lookup method appropriate for the
        "flags" field and attempts to connect using TCP (in future it SHOULD
        attempt all supported transport Protocols) .</t>

        <t>Note that the regexp field in the S-NAPTR example above is empty.
        The regexp field MUST NOT be used when discovering PCE, as its usage
        can be complex and error prone. Also, the discovery of the PCE does
        not require the flexibility provided by this field over a static
        target present in the TARGET field.</t>

        <t>As the default behavior, the client is configured with the
        information about which transport protocol is used for a path
        computation service in a particular domain. The client can directly
        perform an SRV query for that specific transport using the service
        identifier of the path computation Service. For example, if the client
        knows that it should be using TCP for path computation service, it can
        perform a SRV query directly for_PCE._tcp.example.com.</t>

        <t>Once the server providing the desired service and the transport
        protocol has been determined, the next step is to determine the IP
        address.</t>

        <t>According to the specification of SRV RRs in [RFC2782], the TARGET
        field is a fully qualified domain-name (FQDN) that MUST have one or
        more address records; the FQDN must not be an alias, i.e., there MUST
        NOT be a CNAME or DNAME RR at this name. Unless the SRV DNS query
        already has reported a sufficient number of these address records in
        the Additional Data section of the DNS response (as recommended by
        [RFC2782]), the PCC needs to perform A and/or AAAA record lookup(s) of
        the domain-name, as appropriate. The result will be a list of IP
        addresses, each of which can be contacted using the transport protocol
        determined previously.</t>

        <section title="Examples">
          <t>As an example, consider a client that wishes to find PCED service
          in the as100.example.com domain. The client performs a S-NAPTR query
          for that domain, and the following NAPTR records are returned:
          <figure>
              <artwork>
  Order Pref Flags  Service     Regexp       Replacement
   IN NAPTR  50   50   "s"  "pce:pce.tls.tcp"    ""
     _PCE._tcp.as100.example.com
   IN NAPTR  90   50   "s"  "pce:pce.tcp"    ""
      _PCE._tcp.as100.example.com

</artwork>
            </figure></t>

          <t>This indicates that the domain does have a PCE providing Path
          Computation services over TCP, in that order of preference. If the
          client only supports TCP, TCP will be used, targeted to a host
          determined by an SRV lookup of _PCE._tcp.example.com. That lookup
          would return: <figure>
              <artwork>
    ;;  Priority  Weight    Port        Target
  IN  SRV    0        1      XXXX   server1.as100.example.com
  IN  SRV    0        2      XXXX   server2.as100.example.com
</artwork>
            </figure>where XXXX represents the port number at which the
          service is reachable.</t>

          <t>As an alternative example, a client wishes to discover a PCE in
          the ex2.example.com realm that supports the GCO application over
          TCP. The client performs a NAPTR query for that domain, and the
          following NAPTR records are returned: <figure>
              <artwork>
       ;;        order pref flags service   regexp replacement
       IN NAPTR  150   50   "a"   "pce:pce.tcp"  ""
                    server1.ex2.example.com
       IN NAPTR  150   50   "a"   "pce:pce.tls.tcp"  ""
                    server2.ex2.example.com
       IN NAPTR  150   50   "a"   "pce+ap1:pce.tcp"  ""
                    server1.ex2.example.com
       IN NAPTR  150   50   "a"   "pce+ap1:pce.tls.tcp"  ""
                    server2.ex2.example.com
</artwork>
            </figure></t>

          <t>This indicates that the server supports GCO(ID=1) over TCP and
          TLS/TCP via hosts server1.ex2.example.com and
          server2.ex2.example.com, respectively.</t>

      <section title="Determining path computation scope,capability,the PCE domains and Neighbor PCE domains">
        <t>DNS servers MAY use DNS TXT record to give additional information
        about PCE service and add such TXT record to the additional
        information section (See section 4.1 of [RFC1035]) that are relevant
        to the answer and have the same authenticity as the data (Generally
        this will be made up of A and SRV records)in the answer section. The
        additional information may include path computation scope, capability,
        the PCE domains and Neighbor PCE domains associated with the PCE. If
        discovery of PCE supporting a specific PCE capability described in
        section 7.2 has already been performed, capability associated with the
        PCE does not need to be included in the additional information.</t>

        <t>To store new types of information, the TXT record uses a structured
        format in its TXT-DATA field [RFC1035]. The format consists of the
        attribute name followed by the value of the attribute. The name and
        value are separated by an equals sign (=). The general syntax is
        defined in section 2 of [RFC1464] as follows: <figure>
            <artwork>
&lt;owner&gt; &lt;class&gt; &lt;ttl&gt; TXT "&lt;attribute name&gt;=&lt;attribute value&gt;"
</artwork>
          </figure></t>

        <t>For example, the following TXT records contain attributes specified
        in this fashion: <figure>
            <artwork>
ex2.example.com    IN   TXT   "path computation scope=inter-as"
ex2.example.com    IN   TXT   "capability=link constraint"
ex2.example.com    IN   TXT   “pce domain = as10”
ex2.example.com    IN   TXT   “neighbor pce domain= area1”
</artwork>
          </figure></t>

        <t>The PCC MAY inspect those Additional Information section in the DNS
        message and be capable of handling responses from nameservers that
        never fill in the Additional Information part of a response.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document specifies an enhancement to the NAPTR service field
      format. The enhancement and modifications are based on the S-NAPTR,
      which is actually a simplification of the NAPTR, and therefore the same
      security considerations described in [RFC3958] are applicable to this
      document.</t>

      <t>For most of those identified threats, the DNS Security Extensions
      [RFC4033] does provide protection. It is therefore recommended to
      consider the usage of DNSSEC [RFC4033] and the aspects of DNSSEC
      Operational Practices [RFC6781] when deploying Path Computation
      Services.</t>

      <t>In deployments where DNSSEC usage is not feasible, measures should be
      taken to protect against forged DNS responses and cache poisoning as
      much as possible. Efforts in this direction are documented in
      [RFC5452].</t>

      <t>However a malicious host doing S-NAPTR queries learns applications
      supported by PCEs in a certain realm faster, which might help the
      malicious host to scan potential targets for an attack more efficiently
      when some applications have known vulnerabilities.</t>

      <t>Where inputs to the procedure described in this document are fed via
      DHCP, DHCP vulnerabilities can also cause issues. For instance, the
      inability to authenticate DHCP discovery results may lead to the Path
      Computation service results also being incorrect, even if the DNS
      process was secured.</t>
