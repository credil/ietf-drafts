Internet-Draft         Stateless Deterministic NAT         November 2011


1.  Introduction

   NAT44 and DS-Lite [RFC6333],are two solutions to deal with the IPv4
   exhaustion problem.  NAT44 solves it by introducing a second layer of
   NAT in the ISP network.  DS-Lite solves it by decoupling the
   deployment of IPv6 in the access network from the deployment of IPv6
   in the applications.  DS-Lite is based on a combination of IPv4 over
   IPv6 encapsulation and a carrier grade NAT (CGN).

   There have been a number of efforts at IETF to evolve the DS-Lite
   model by moving the NAT function from a centralized, stateful carrier
   grade NAT to the CPEs by allocating a fixed number of ports to each
   customer.  The provider equipment would then only do the
   decapsulation of the IPv4 traffic, providing a stateless operation
   model, where a number of those relay devices could be operated
   independently in the ISP network.  One drawback of such design, is
   that the service provider looses some flexibility on how ports are
   allocated.  In particular, The IPv6 and global IPv4 address spaces
   are mapped to each over, making it difficult for an ISP to add or
   remove addresses from the NAT pool.  Another drawback is that the
   number of IPv4 port allocated per subscriber is encoded in the IPv6
   address.  This results in a renumbering event when the ISP want to
   change the IPv4 oversubscription ratio.

   Another direction has been to define a deterministic operation model
   for NAT44 CGNs, where ports are statically distributed to users on
   that CGN.  A deterministic mapping function is defined to convert an
   internal address to an external address and port range.  This mapping
   function is reversible, eliminating the need to keep logs for abuse/
   LEA purpose.  However, such a deterministic NAT still need to
   maintain per connection state and as such is not stateless.

   This proposal enhances the deterministic NAT model.  By offering a
   fully programmatic mapping of the complete NAT binding, it enables a
   carrier-grade NAT/ AFTR to become completely stateless and
   deterministic.  This model of operation applies similarly to DS-Lite
   and NAT44 environments.

   The SD-NAT architecture has the following characteristics:

   o  Zero log: Because the SD-CGN/SD-AFTR NAT bindings are
      deterministic and reversible, the ISP does not need to keep any
      NAT binding logs.

   o  Zero state on SD-CGN/SD-AFTR: There is no operational per-session
      state on the SD-CGNs/SD-AFTRs.  By leveraging this stateless and
      deterministic mode of operation, an ISP can deploy any number of
      SD-CGNs/SD-AFTRs to provide redundancy and scalability at low



Penno, et al.              Expires May 4, 2012                  [Page 3]

      cost.  Because the NAT mappings on the CGNs or AFTRs are fully
      stateless and deterministic, routers can implement the
      functionality in hardware and perform it at very high speed with
      very low overhead in terms of packet delay.

   o  Low barrier of adoption: SD-CPEs can remain IPv4-only devices.
      Only minor code change or configuration is required to modify the
      port mapping algorithms, the rest of the CPE implementation
      remains the same.  The ISP access network can also remain IPv4-
      only, enabling the ISP to deploy IPv6 independently to this IPv4-
      exhaustion solution.

   o  Flexibility of operation: The ISP can add or remove addresses from
      the NAT pool without having to renumber the access network.

   o  Compatible with IPv6: This SD-NAT mechanism can be deployed
      similarly by IPv4-only ISPs, Dual-Stack ISPs or IPv6-only ISPs.
      In the IPv4 case, the SD-CPE WAN Ipv4 address is used as customer
      index, in the IPv6 case, IPv4 packets are tunneled over IPv6 just
      like in the DS-Lite case and the SD-CPE WAN IPv6 address is used
      as customer index.


2.  SD-CPE operation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   An SD-CPE operates like a regular CPE with some modification on the
   way the NAT function is performed.

2.1.  SD-CPE NAT function

   The SD-CPE performs IPv4 NAPT from the internal RFC1918 addresses to
   the IPv4 address configured on the WAN interface.  In a DS-Lite
   environment, the B4 address 192.0.0.2 is used in lieu of the IPv4 WAN
   interface.

   Internal IPv4 source ports are translated into the range
   [1024..maxport].  Different SD-CPEs can implement different methods
   to determine the value of maxport, some of which are defined below.

   A key design element here is that the SD-CGN or SD-AFTR can make the
   assumption that all datagrams coming from the SD-CPE will have source
   ports formatted in a well-known range.  This will make the stateless
   deterministic NAT function on the SD-CGN or SD-AFTR easy to
   implement.

Internet-Draft         Stateless Deterministic NAT         November 2011


   Another key design element is that the SD-CPE does not need to know
   which external IPv4 address it will be mapped to.  That design
   element allows for a great flexibility on the ISP side, the pool of
   global IPv4 addresses on the SD-CGNs or SD-AFTRs can be changed at
   any time with little impact on the subscriber.  The subscriber
   configuration will not have to change, the SD-CPE will not have to
   renumber or reboot, however the current connections may or may not
   survive depending on the pool update mechanism implemented on the SD-
   CGNs / SD-AFTRs.  Note: the SD-CPE can learn the external address it
   is mapped to using the PCP protocol defined in [I-D.ietf-pcp-base].

2.2.  SD-CPE maxport configuration

   The simplest way to build an SD-CPE is to configure it with a maxport
   value.  This could be done, for example, using either manual
   configuration, a TR69 parameter to be defined or a DHCP option, to be
   defined.

   A quick look at the open source OpenWRT project show that the
   functionality to restrict the source port space is already present,
   so no new code is necessary.

2.3.  SD-CPE with incremental port allocation

   In this model, an SD-CPE would dynamically learn the value of maxport
   instead of being configured with it.  This removes a configuration
   step of the CPE.  The trade-off is that some new code implementing
   the following algorithm must be implemented on the SD-CPE.

   When the incremental SD-CPE needs to allocate a new external port, it
   MUST start from 1024 and increment until it finds an un-allocated
   port.  If the SD-CPE allocates a port number that is too high and
   does not fit into the range allocated on the SD-CGN or SD-AFTR, the
   outgoing packet will be dropped by the SD-CGN or SD-AFTR and an ICMP
   [RFC0792] message type 13 (Communication administratively prohibited)
   will be returned to the SD-CPE.

   The trade-off to the simplicity of this algorithm are a) the restart
   at 1024 may use extra cycles and b) port randomization is impacted.
   See alternative scramble techniques on SD-CGN/SD-AFTR to mitigate
   this issue.

2.4.  SD-CPE with dynamic maxport determination

   In this model the SD-CPE will try to determine the value of maxport.
   The easiest way of doing this is to send dummy packets at boot time
   starting with source port 1024 and incrementing the source port
   number until the ICMP message type 13 is received.  This is, however,



Penno, et al.              Expires May 4, 2012                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         Stateless Deterministic NAT         November 2011


   quite inefficient.  A better way is to use a dichotomy algorithm.
   Start with a high port of 65535 and a low port of 1024 and then
   divide the space in two depending on the reception (or non-reception
   of the ICMP message type 13.  The advantage over incremental port
   allocation is that source port randomization is preserved.

   Note 1: this dichotomy algorithm can be apply to real traffic, there
   is no need to send dummy packets.  If the ICMP message type 13 is
   received, then the packet is retransmitted with a lower source port
   number.

   Note 2: if an ICMP message type 13 does not come back within (TBD)
   seconds, the packets is considered successfully delivered through the
   SD-CGN/SD-NAT.


3.  Host based SD-NAT, Wireless application

   If the SD-CPE is running it's own applications sourcing datagrams on
   its WAN interface (or B4 element 192.0.0.2), or if a host is directly
   connected to the ISP access network, it must select a source port
   using the same algorithm as the NAPT function.

   In particular, this makes SD-NAT well suited for wireless
   environments where the UE can be easily programmed to restrict its
   outgoing source port space.


4.  SD-CGN and SD-AFTR operation

4.1.  Anycast IPv6 address for SD-AFTR

   All SD-AFTRs associated to a domain (or group of users) will be
   configured with the same IPv6 address on the interface facing IPv6
   customers.  A route for that IPv6 address will be anycasted within
   the access network.

4.2.  Multiple default IPv4 routes leading to SD-CGN

   Similarly, in the NAT44 environment, the IPv4 traffic will be send to
   a number of SD-CGNs using a number of default routes or equivalent
   techniques.

4.3.  SD-CGN and SD-AFTR operation

   All SD-CGNs or SD-AFTRs associated to a domain (or group of users)
   will be configured with the same pool of global IPv4 addresses.  They
   will be configured also with the same deterministic address and port

   mapping function.  This function will map the customer ID, derived
   from either its private IPv4 address in the NAT44 case or its IPv6
   address in the DS-Lite case and the source port used by the incoming
   connection into a global IPv4 address and port.

4.4.  Mapping function

   Various mapping functions can be defined.  This is an implementation
   issue on the SD-CGNs or SD-AFTRs, however that function MUST be the
   same on all the SD-CGNs or SD-AFTRs within a domain.

   The input parameters of that mapping function are the number of
   addresses in the IPv4 global pool, the number of customers and the
   maximum number of ports per customers.

   Note: external ports in the range of [0..1023] MAY be excluded in the
   mapping function , however this is not a requirement.

4.5.  Example mapping function

   Lets say that all external ports above 1023 are used and a 1024 ports
   are allocated per subscriber, and only one IPv4 address is configured
   in the NAT pool.  Customer #1 will have external ports 1024 to 2047,
   customer #2 will have external ports 2048 to 3071, etc...

   Here is an algorithm that produces this result:

   Input variables:

   o  i: subscriber index

   o  maxPort: maximum number of ports per subscriber

   o  baseCPE:CPE address base, determined by Service Provider, e.g.
      172.16.0.1

   o  baseCGN:CGN address base, determined by Service Provider e.g.
      1.2.3.1.

   Each SD-CPE implements a stateful NAT44 function with the following
   mappings:

   o  host_src_ip is mapped to: CPE WAN IPv4.

   o  host_src_port is mapped to: port, Where port is the first
      available port starting at 1024.

   Each SD-CGN/SD-AFTR implements a deterministic stateless NAT44

   function with following mappings:

      cpe_src_ip is mapped to: baseCGN + floor ( i / P)

      cpe_src_port is mapped to: cpe_src_port + maxPort x (i mod P) )

      Where i = cpe_src_ip - baseCPE and P = floor ( (65536-1024) /
      maxPort )

      Note that in this simple algorithm, (65536-1024) must be multiple
      of maxPort.  However, with minor modification to the algorithm,
      you can avoid this limitation.

4.6.  Port exceeded message

   If the SD-CGN or SD-AFTR receives an incoming datagram with a source
   port number higher than1023 + the maximum number of allocated ports
   per customer, the datagram MUST be dropped and an ICMP [RFC0792]
   error message type 13 (Communication administratively prohibited)
   MUST be returned to the originating SD-CPE.

4.7.  Address compression ratio

   The maximum number of subscriber per IPv4 address is equal to (65536
   minus 1024) divided by the number of ports per user, as configured on
   the SD-CGN or SD-AFTR.

4.8.  Anycast global IPv4 pool

   Routes to the pool of global IPv4 addresses configured on the SD-CGN
   or SD-AFTR will be anycasted by all relevant SD-CGN or SD-AFTRs
   within the ISP routing domain.

4.9.  Stateless operation

   By using anycast IPv4 pool, return IPv4 traffic can go back to any
   SD-CGN or SD-AFTR associated with that pool of address.  Because the
   mapping function is deterministic (shared on all AFTRs) and because
   there is no dynamic state associated with any particular NAT mappings
   on any SD-CGN or SD-AFTR, the returning IPv4 traffic can be
   translated back, re-encapsulated in IPv6 in the case of DS-Lite, and
   send back to the customer by any SD-CGN or SD-AFTRs within the domain

   No need to do port mapping garbage collection on SD-CGN/SD-AFTR:

   Because those bindings are completely stateless and deterministic, an
   SD-CGN or SD-AFTR does not need to maintain state in its port-mapping
   table, and as such, does not need to perform any garbage collection

   on idle connections.  From a subscriber application perspective, that
   mean that the application only need to negotiate ports with the local
   SD-CPE, for example using the PCP protocol.

4.10.  SD-AFTR stateless domain

   Using the DHCPv6 DS-Lite tunnel-end-point option, groups of
   subscribers and can be associated to a different SD-AFTR domain.
   That can allow for differentiated level of services, e.g. number of
   ports per customer device, QoS, bandwidth, value added services,...

4.11.  SD-CGN/SD-AFTR post mapping source port scrambling

   In order to improve source port randomization, an SD-CGN or SD-AFTR
   can do post-mapping source port scrambling.  The details of this
   optional feature are out of scope of this document.  The scrambling
   function MUST be the same on all SD-CGN/SD-AFTR responsible for the
   same global IPv4 pool, and configured with the same parameters on all
   those devices.  That scrambling function MUST be reversible.


5.  SD-NAT 444 example

   This examples assume two SD-CGNs or two SD-AFTRs configured with the
   same IPv4 global address in their NAT pool.  The operator has
   configured a limit of 1024 ports per subscriber.  Subscriber #3 has 2
   hosts, each running one connection and subscriber #7 has one host
   running one connection.  Subscriber #3 SD-CPE WAN IPv4 address is
   172.16.0.3 in case of NAT44 or WAN IPv6 address 2001:db8::3 in case
   of DS-LITE.  Subscriber #7 WAN IPv4 address is 172.16.0.7 in case of
   NAT44 or WANT IPv6 address 2001:db8::7 in case of DS-LITE.  Host 1
   and 2 in subscriber #3 network are using IPv4 address 192.168.1.2 and
   192.168.1.3, and host 1 in subscriber #7 network is using IPv4
   address 192.168.1.2.

   running one connection and subscriber #7 has one host running one
   connection.  Subscriber #3 SD-CPE WAN IPv6 address is 2001:db8::3.
   Subscriber #7 WAN IPv6 address is 2001:db8::7.  Both SD-CPE use the
   same B4 address 192.0.0.2, as specified in DS-Lite.  Host 1 and 2 in
   subscriber #3 network are using IPv4 address 192.168.1.2 and
   192.168.1.3, and host 1 in subscriber #7 network is using IPv4
   address 192.168.1.2.

7.  Comparison with other techniques

7.1.  Comparison with DS-Lite and NAT44 CGN

   The trade-off of this stateless deterministic model of operation is
   efficiency in IPv4 address sharing.  A typical DS-Lite or NAT44
   environment can share an IPv4 address among over 1000 customers, if
   the ratio of maximum number of port used by any given subscriber to
   the maximum average number of ports used by all subscribers is high.
   A typical SD-DS-Lite or SD-NAT44 environment will share the same
   address among only about 100 subscribers, using a maximum number of
   ports per subscribers of 600.

7.2.  Comparison with 4rd/4via6/A+P/DIVI

   The main difference with 4rd/A+P/4via6/DIVI techniques is that the
   CPE is unaware of the exact port distribution algorithm.  That way,
   the ISP maintains the flexibility to change the numbers of ports
   allocated per subscriber, or add/delete/modify the pool of available
   global IPv4 addresses at any time without creating a customer outage.

   SD-DS-Lite is based on encapsulation, 4via6 and DIVI are based on
   double translation IPv4 to IPv6 and back to IPv4.  Service providers
   have deployed encapsulation techniques for many years, double
   translation is new and there is less operational experience with it.

   An SD-CPE sends packets through a set of identified devices, the SD-
   CGNs or SD-AFTRs.  This enables simple enforcement points to do IPv4
   subscriber management (e.g. counting IPv4 traffic).  A consequence of
   that architecture in the SD-DS-Lite model is that is does not allow
   for 4rd style shortcuts, where traffic between customers within the
   same domain does not go through the relay.


8.  IANA Considerations

   None.


9.  Security Considerations

   As described in [RFC6269], with any fixed size address sharing
   techniques, port randomization is achieve with a smaller entropy.
   Post mapping source port scrambling (see section XXX) can mitigate
   this issue.

   Recommendations listed in [RFC6302] applies.
