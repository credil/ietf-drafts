Internet-Draft           ARF Reporting Discovery               July 2011


1.  Introduction

   As the spam problem continues to expand and potential solutions
   evolve, network operators are increasingly exchanging abuse reports
   among themselves and other parties.  While [MARF-BASE] defines the
   Abuse Reporting Format (ARF) for these reports, it assumes that the
   operators will use some undefined method to discover each other and
   enter into any necessary agreements.

   The advertisement method defined in this memo is intended to ease the
   process for potential ARF recipients to discover whether a particular
   ADministrative Management Domain (ADMD) has the facility and
   willingness to generate ARF reports, and for ARF generators to
   discover whether a particular ADMD is able and willing (and
   authorized) to receive ARF reports.

   While written primarily for initial discovery and configuration of
   feedback relationships, it is expected that these advertisements will
   also be useful for updating participants when parameters have
   changed.

   Further, while this document only defines a DNS TXT record to contain
   these advertisements, other methods may be defined in the future.

   This document only defines the process for advertisement and
   discovery of feedback recipients.  Determination of when it is
   appropriate to send feedback or how trust may be established between
   report generators and report consumers is outside the scope of this
   document.  It is assumed that best practices will continue to evolve
   over time, and will be codified in future documents.

   Similarly, nothing in this draft is intended to preclude other
   methods that a Feedback Generator might use to determine where to
   send a report.  For example, if the report were to be keyed off of
   the domain of an email address or a URL inside of the body of a
   message this discovery mechanism may be inappropriate.


2.  Purpose

   The reports defined in [MARF-BASE] are intended to inform mail
   operators about:
   o  email abuse originating from their networks;
   o  potential issues with the perceived quality of outbound mail, such
      as email service providers sending mail that attracts the
      attention of automated abuse detection systems.
   To support these and other related purposes, this document addresses
   two primary use cases:



Falk                    Expires January 28, 2012                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft           ARF Reporting Discovery               July 2011


   o  Any ADMD may advertise its willingness to receive reports from the
      internet at large, given particular criteria included in or
      referenced by the advertisement;
   o  Any ADMD may advertise their willingness to provide reports to the
      Internet at large, given particular criteria included in or
      referenced by the advertisement;

   Further, an ADMD which is generating reports may query the
   advertisement of an ADMD that wishes to receive reports, in order to
   confirm that an out-of-band request to receive reports is legitimate
   and/or to determine if any of the characteristics of the request have
   changed.

   This specification inherits from [MARF-BASE] that it is intended
   specifically for communications among providers regarding email abuse
   and related issues, and SHOULD NOT be used for other reports unless
   those feedback-types specifically mention this document.  For
   example, the [DKIM-REPORTING] extension includes its own ARF
   recipient discovery method that should not be confused with the
   method defined in this memo.


3.  Requirements

   The advertisement and discovery process must be easily accessible to
   the software involved in providing email service, preferably using
   concepts and technologies an email operator can be assumed to be
   familiar with.  Thus, following the examples of [DKIM] and
   [DKIM-REPORTING], the advertisement is in the form of a [DNS] TXT
   record.  While this may provide challenges for offline processing,
   this is outweighed by the advantages of security and maintainability.

   In order to reflect current usage, advertisements must also provide
   the ability to reference complex "terms of service" or other
   documents outside of the scope of a simple discovery method.  This is
   accomplished through the inclusion of a URI.

   And finally, the advertisement must be readable by humans (assuming
   they have access to this RFC) as well as software specifically
   written for the purpose.


4.  Language

   This section defines various terms used throughout this document.

4.1.  General

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

4.2.  Email Specific

   [EMAIL-ARCH] introduces several terms and concepts that are used in
   this memo, and thus readers are advised to become familiar with it as
   well.

4.3.  ARF Specific

   [MARF-BASE] introduces terms and concepts that are necessary for a
   full understanding of this memo, and thus readers are advised to read
   it before continuing.


5.  Characteristics of a Feedback Reporting Advertisement

   An advertisement of willingness to generate or receive feedback is
   accomplished by publishing a TXT record in the [DNS] using the name
   '_report' within the given DNS domain.

   This record will contain a sequence of "tag=value" pairs, separated
   by semicolons.  The tags and possible values are described in the
   next two sections, followed by the precise ABNF grammar.

   In the case of a feedback consumer, the advertisement should be
   published in the DNS domain matching the [DKIM] 'd=' value used on
   outgoing signatures, and/or in the DNS domain matching the one
   present in the [SMTP] MAIL commands it issues when sending mail,
   and/or in the DNS domain referenced by the DNS PTR record (sometimes
   called "reverse DNS") of the IP address of the border MTA used to
   transfer the message.

   In the case of a feedback generator, to inquire whether or not an
   ADMD wishes to receive feedback reports, the DNS domain to which the
   report should be sent is determined (using the [DKIM] d= string) and
   then a TXT record query to the above name is issued.  For example, if
   a report generator wishes to generate a report about a message
   bearing DNS domain 'example.com', the generator would issue a TXT
   record query for `_report.example.com'.

   Feedback generators SHOULD NOT send reports to ADMDs that are not in
   any way responsible for the reported message, for both security and
   efficiency reasons.  Responsibility can be ascertained as described



Falk                    Expires January 28, 2012                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           ARF Reporting Discovery               July 2011


   in Section 7, and by applying local policy.

   In the case of a feedback generator who wishes to advertise that
   reports are available, the TXT record is placed by the DNS domain at
   which they receive mail.  For example, to advertise reports regarding
   mail received at example.net, the advertisement is placed in
   _report.example.net.

5.1.  Feedback Consumers

   A "Feedback Consumer" is an entity which wishes to receive feedback.
   In most cases, the Feedback Consumer will be within the same ADMD as
   the identifier (domain name or IP address) used to determine the
   source of a message.

   The following tags are defined for Feedback Consumers:

   r  the address to which reports should be sent.  Required; there is
      no default.  This address MUST be able to respond to an emailed
      subscription verification request; see Security Considerations
      below.
   rf the format of the report requested; currently only "ARF"
      ([MARF-BASE]) is supported.  Optional; defaults to ARF.
   ri requested report interval; may not be supported by all
      implementors.  Optional; if omitted, all reports may be sent.
   rt colon-separated list of ARF ([MARF-BASE]) feedback types for which
      reports are requested.  Optional; if omitted, all report types may
      be sent.
   re email address of a person or role account responsible for handling
      any issues related to receiving reports.  Optional, but SHOULD be
      defined; defaults to abuse@ the DNS domain.
   rp stated policy, as listed below.  Optional; defaults to "o".
   ru URI for additional contact information.  Optional, but SHOULD be
      defined; there is no default value.

5.1.1.  Feedback Consumer Policies

   Policies are listed in the "rp" tag, described above.
   o  open to reports from all sources.  This is the default.
   c  closed; no reports are requested.  This option is intended for
      testing purposes, or for feedback arrangements which have been set
      up using methods outside of the scope of this document.

5.1.2.  Feedback Consumer re= Default

   As described above, the default re= value is abuse@ the DNS domain.
   Report Generators are cautioned that re= is the address of a
   responsible person; this address may not be equipped to parse ARF



Falk                    Expires January 28, 2012                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           ARF Reporting Discovery               July 2011


   reports.  Instead, ARF reports MUST only be sent to the address in
   the r= value.

   Feedback Consumers are similarly cautioned that deciding not to
   publish an advertisement in accordance with this specification does
   not guarantee that all Report Generators won't send unsolicited ARF
   reports to your abuse@ or postmaster@ address.  Thus, all domain
   owners are encouraged to publish explicit information even in case it
   happens to agree with the default values: in addition to better
   clarity, it may also improve caching.

5.2.  Feedback Generators

   A "Feedback Generator" is an entity which generates feedback reports.
   Often, the Feedback Generator is within the same ADMD as the mail
   server which received the message.

   The following tags are defined for Feedback Generators:

   gf the format of reports offered; currently only "ARF" ([MARF-BASE])
      is supported.  Optional; defaults to "ARF".
   gt colon-separated list of ARF ([MARF-BASE]) feedback types for which
      reports are available.  (Optional; if omitted, any report types
      may be generated.)
   ge email address of a person (or role account) responsible for
      handling any issues related to receiving reports.  Optional, but
      SHOULD be defined; defaults to postmaster@ the DNS domain.
   gp stated policy, as listed below.  Optional; defaults to "o".
   gu URI for additional information.  This field SHOULD be defined for
      a policy of "o" or "c", and MUST be defined when the policy is
      "r".  Otherwise, the field is optional; there is no default.

5.2.1.  Feedback Generator Policies

   Policies are listed in the "gp" tag, described above.

   o  open to providing reports to any consumer.  This option is the
      default policy.
   r  open to providing reports only after the prospective consumer has
      completed an application process, which may be found at the URI
      defined by the "gu" tag above.
   c  closed; no reports are available.  This option is intended for
      testing purposes, or for feedback arrangements which have been set
      up using methods outside of the scope of this document.

Internet-Draft           ARF Reporting Discovery               July 2011


5.3.  Combining Generator and Consumer Tags in the Same Record

   It is common for a Feedback Generator to also act as a Feedback
   Consumer.  When this happens, they MAY include both types of tags in
   the same TXT record.

   When parsing these records, implementors MUST accept both types of
   tags in the same record, and MUST NOT expect the tags to appear in
   any particular order.  Implementors MUST ignore any unfamiliar tags
   or other unexpected text.

5.4.  Note about URIs

   While this memo assumes that advertisements will contain http:// or
   similar URIs, implementors should be aware that the URI-related
   fields can carry many different types of data depending on the URI
   scheme used.  For more information, please consult the URI Schemes
   registry maintained by IANA.

5.5.  Formal Definition

   The formal definition using [ABNF] is TBD.


6.  Example Records for Various Use Cases

   While (in the author's mind) these examples address many of the most
   common use cases, implementers MUST NOT assume that only these
   configurations will ever be seen on the real live internet.

6.1.  Example Feedback Consumer Records

   Perhaps the most common scenario today is where a sender of bulk
   commercial email wishes to receive any complaints about messages
   originating from the servers under their control.  These servers are
   identified by IP address or range.  The PTR record for one of the IP
   addresses in question is "outmail5.example.com", so the advertisement
   could be:

   _report.outmail5.example.com TXT "r=complaints@example.com; rf=ARF;
   rt=abuse,fraud,virus,other; re=isprelations@example.com;"

   This would need to be repeated for each PTR record, perhaps
   outmail1.example.com through outmail7.example.com.  (NOTE: per [DNS],
   you cannot have both PTR and TXT associated with the same DNS record.
   Instead, the TXT record is associated with the _destination_ of the
   PTR pointer.)




Falk                    Expires January 28, 2012                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft           ARF Reporting Discovery               July 2011


   Or, if they sign all of their outbound mail with a [DKIM] d= string
   of "example.com", they could place the same advertisement in a TXT
   record at _report.example.com.

   example.com TXT "r=complaints@example.com; rf=ARF;
   rt=abuse,fraud,virus,other; re=isprelations@example.com;"

   Another common scenario is of a mailbox or access provider who wishes
   to receive complaints about mail sent by their users.  That record
   would be very similar, and would again be applied to PTR and/or d=
   domains:

   example.com TXT "r=abuse@example.net; rf=ARF; rt=abuse,fraud,virus;
   re=postmaster@example.net;"

6.2.  Example Feedback Generator Records

   The most common scenario today is where a large mailbox provider
   offers feedback to qualified Feedback Consumers who have filled out
   an application form.  While the full application process cannot be
   adequately represented inside of a single DNS record, the "gp" and
   "gu" fields permit advertisement of this policy:

   example.net TXT "gf=ARF; gt=abuse; ge=postmaster@example.net; gp=r;
   gu=http://postmaster.example.net/fbl/"

   However, it is rare for a Feedback Generator -- most often a mailbox
   provider or similar service -- to not also be a Feedback Consumer.
   If they wish to place an advertisement using the PTR method, there is
   usually no conflict.  However, if their outbound mail is signed with
   [DKIM] and the d= value is the same domain at which they receive
   mail, then the advertisement will need to contain both generator and
   consumer tags:

   example.net TXT "gf=ARF; gt=abuse; ge=postmaster@example.net; gp=r;
   gu=http://postmaster.example.net/fbl/"; rf=ARF;
   r=abuse+arf@example.net; rt=abuse,fraud,other;
   re=postmaster@example.net;"

   Or, they MAY split the Generator and Consumer tags into separate TXT
   records under the same domain.

   Were a Feedback Generator to only offer authentication results, they
   could advertise thusly:

   "gf=ARF; gt=auth; ge=postmaster@example.net; gp=o;
   gu=http://postmaster.example.net/auth/"

Internet-Draft           ARF Reporting Discovery               July 2011


7.  Authentication of Reported Message

   [AUTH-METHODS] and its extensions define a number of authentication
   methods that allow the recipient of a message to determine which ADMD
   is responsible for the message.  A Report Generator MUST utilize one
   or more of these methods to ensure that reports are being sent to a
   Report Consumer within the correct ADMD, and furthermore it is
   RECOMMENDED that the Report Consumer utilize these same methods to
   ensure that a message reported to them was indeed sent by who they
   think it was sent by.  For example:

7.1.  DKIM signatures

   Any valid DKIM signature in the reported message provides a domain
   name, either the signature "d" tag, or the domain-part of the
   signature "i" tag.

7.2.  SPF authorized sender

   When the check_host() function described in [SPF] results in a "pass"
   for the envelope sender, the domain part of that address.  Otherwise,
   if a "pass" is obtained for the HELO/EHLO name, that domain name is
   used.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This memo will create an IANA registry of MARF discovery record tags
   and their legal values and defining documents; this section is yet to
   be written.


9.  Security Considerations

   The following security considerations apply when generating or
   processing a feedback report:

9.1.  Inherited from MARF-BASE

   All of the Security Considerations from [MARF-BASE] are inherited
   here.

9.2.  These Need Fleshing Out

   Subscription verification requests.

   [DNSSEC] SHOULD be used to ensure authenticity of all DNS requests
   and replies.

   Reference the data redaction discussion that will appear in an
   updated dkim-reporting draft soon.

   Feedback destination mailboxes are potentially sinks for private
   information, and should be secured accordingly.  The precise methods
   of securing mailbox files are outside of the scope of this document.

   Additional security considerations are likely, and TBD.

9.3.  Privacy considerations

   [Should these be moved to a BCP?]

   When recipients report received messages as spam, they deny any
   involvement with whoever may turn out to be responsible of authoring
   or forwarding that mail.  Users submit that spam to the community at
   large in the hope that a corrective action may be taken.  In that
   respect, the only privacy issue is to avoid to further divulge the
   email addresses of reporting users, or let them be profiled.
   Suitably redacted email addresses are an acceptable remedy.
   Responsible senders are advised to include opaque tokens as
   necessary, in order to reconstruct needed data.

   However, users may also err.  Unwanted smear may result in case a
   message containing confidential data is erroneously reported as spam.
   Authentication and policies are concerned with avoiding such
   circumstances.  Recipients of special addresses at an ADMD that
   handled a given message could have intercepted the message when they
   signed or relayed it, if they wanted to, therefore it is less of a
   concern to forward abuse reports there.

   Contact addresses for a given domain name should bear such name as
   their domain parts.  Generators may treat non-conforming addresses
   with great suspicion, possibly avoiding to relay to them.

Appendix A.  Public Discussion and Support

   [REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION]

   Public discussion of this proposed specification is handled via the
   marf@ietf.org mailing list.  The list is open.  Access to
   subscription forms and to list archives can be found at
   http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/marf/current/maillist.html


Appendix B.  Document History & Open Issues

   [REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION]

B.1.  draft-jdfalk-marf-reporting-discovery-00

   o  NEEDED: WG input, references cleanup, ABNF and other formal
      definitions, and probably lots of other stuff.
   o  QUESTION: should this include IODEF as a format?

B.2.  draft-jdfalk-marf-reporting-discovery-01

   o  Changed from "Experimental" to "Standards Track".
   o  Various non-normative textual & formatting improvements, most
      importantly changing "hangtext" to "hangText" because xml2rfc is
      (surprisingly) case-sensitive.
   o  Added the PTR record as another place to look for advertisements
      published by ARF consumers.  (This may require additional
      clarifications later in the text.)
   o  Moved a few references from normative to informative.
   o  Questions & needs listed for version 00 remain valid.

B.3.  draft-jdfalk-marf-reporting-discovery-02

   o  Added authentication-related and privacy considerations sections
      written by Alessandro Vesely.
   o  Questions & needs listed for versions 00 and 01 remain valid.

B.4.  draft-jdfalk-marf-reporting-discovery-03

   o  Removed references to end-user report submissions; those should be
      left for a separate document, and probably be discoverable in the
      same way as MUA settings.
   o  Rewrote some confusing parts.
   o  Added the examples section.
   o  QUESTION: should the advertisement be published somewhere other
      than DNS?
   o  Questions & needs listed for earlier versions remain valid.
   o  QUESTION: should this document include a description of how the
      complaint feedback signup process works today, and how this
      proposal would change it?  Or is that a separate Informational
      document?
   o  QUESTION: should the current Privacy Considerations section be
      moved to a separate BCP?

B.5.  draft-ietf-marf-reporting-discovery-00

   o  This draft now belongs to the MARF WG.  Yay!
   o  Added "Feedback Consumer re= Default" section.

B.6.  draft-ietf-marf-reporting-discovery-01

   o  Minor wording change to clarify DKIM d= domain.
   o  Removed unused references.
