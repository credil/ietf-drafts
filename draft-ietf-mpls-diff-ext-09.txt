This document defines a flexible solution for support of
Differentiated Services (Diff-Serv) over Multi-Protocol Label
Switching (MPLS) networks.

This solution allows the MPLS network administrator to select how
Diff-Serv Behavior Aggregates (BAs) are mapped onto Label Switched
Paths (LSPs) so that he/she can best match the Diff-Serv, Traffic
Engineering and protection objectives within his/her particular
network.  For instance, this solution allows the network
administrator to decide whether different sets of BAs are to be
mapped onto the same LSP or mapped onto separate LSPs.

This document is a product of the Multiprotocol Label Switching
Working Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
