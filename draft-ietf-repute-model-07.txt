                    A Model for Reputation Reporting
                       draft-ietf-repute-model-07

Abstract

   This document describes a general architecture for a reputation-based
   service and a model for requesting reputation-related data over the
   Internet, where "reputation" refers to predictions or expectations
   about an entity or an identifier such as a domain name.  The document
   roughly follows the recommendations of RFC4101 for describing a
   protocol model.

Internet-Draft         Reputation Reporting Model              July 2013


1.  Introduction

   Historically, many Internet protocols have operated between
   unauthenticated entities.  For example, an email message's author
   field (From) [MAIL] can contain any display name or address and is
   not verified by the recipient or other agents along the delivery
   path.  Similarly, a sending email server using [SMTP] trusts that the
   [DNS] has led it to the intended receiving server.  Both kinds of
   trust are easily betrayed, opening the operation to subversion of
   some kind, which leads to spam, phishing, and other attacks.

   In recent years, explicit identity authentication mechanisms have
   begun to see wider deployment.  For example, the [DKIM] protocol
   permits associating a validated identifier to a message.  This
   association is cryptographically strong, and is an improvement over
   the prior state of affairs, but it does not distinguish between
   identifiers of good actors and bad.  Even when it is possible to
   validate the domain name in an author field (e.g.
   "trustworthy.example.com" in "john.doe@trustworthy.example.com")
   there is no basis for knowing whether it is associated with a good
   actor worthy of trust.  As a practical matter, both bad actors and
   good adopt basic authentication mechanisms like DKIM.  In fact, bad
   actors tend to adopt them even more rapidly than the good actors do
   in the hope that some receivers will confuse identity authentication
   with identity assessment.  The former merely means that the name is
   being used by its owner or their agent, while the latter makes a
   statement about the quality of the owner.

   With the advent of these authentication protocols, it is possible to
   statisfy the requirement for a mechanism by which mutually trusted
   parties can exchange assessment information about other actors.  For
   these purposes, we may usefully define "reputation" as "the
   estimation in which an identifiable actor is held, especially by the
   community or the Internet public generally".  We may call an
   aggregation of individual assessments "reputation input."

   While the need for reputation services has been perhaps especially
   clear in the email world, where abuses are commonplace, other
   Internet services are coming under attack and may have a similar
   need.  For instance, a reputation mechanism could be useful in rating
   the security of web sites, the quality of service of an Internet
   Service Provider (ISP), or an Application Service Provider (ASP).
   More generally, there are many different opportunities for use of
   reputation services, such as customer satisfaction at e-commerce
   sites, and even things unrelated to Internet protocols, such as
   plumbers, hotels, or books.  Just as human beings traditionally rely
   on the recommendations of trusted parties in the physical world, so
   too they can be expected to make use of such reputation services in a

Internet-Draft         Reputation Reporting Model              July 2013


   variety of applications on the Internet.

   A full trust architecture encompasses a range of actors and
   activities, to enable an end-to-end service for creating, exchanging,
   and consuming trust-related information.  One component of that is a
   query mechanism, to permit retrieval of a reputation.  Not all such
   reputation services will need to convey the same information.  Some
   need only produce a basic rating, while others need to provide
   underlying detail.  This is akin to the difference between check
   approval versus a credit report.

   An overall reckoning of goodness versus badness can be defined
   generically, but specific applications are likely to want to describe
   reputations for multiple attributes: an e-commerce site might be
   rated on price, speed of delivery, customer service, etc., and might
   receive very different ratings on each.  Therefore, the model defines
   a generic query mechanism and basic format for reputation retrieval,
   but allows extensions for each application.

   Omitted from this model is the means by which a reputation-reporting
   agent goes about collecting such data and the method for creating an
   evaluation.  The mechanism defined here merely enables asking a
   question and getting an answer; the remainder of an overall service
   provided by such a reputation agent is specific to the implementation
   of that service and is out of scope here.


2.  Overview

   The basic premise of this reputation system involves a client that is
   seeking to evaluate content based on an identifier associated with
   the content, and a reputation service provider that collects,
   aggregates, and makes available for consumption, scores based on the
   collected data.  Typically client and service operators enter into
   some kind of agreement during which some parameters are exchanged
   such as the location at which the reputation service can be reached,
   the nature of the reputation data being offered, possibly some client
   authentication details, and the like.

   Upon receipt of some content the client operator wishes to evaluate
   (an Internet message, for example), the client extracts from the
   content one or more identifiers of interest to be evaluated.
   Examples of this include the domain name found in the From: field of
   a message, or the domain name extracted from a valid DomainKeys
   Identified Mail (DKIM) signature.

   Next, the goal is to ask the reputation service provider what the
   reputation of the extracted identifier is.  The query will contain

Internet-Draft         Reputation Reporting Model              July 2013


   the identifier to be evaluated and possibly some context-specific
   information (such as to establish the context of the query, e.g., an
   email message) or client-specific information.  The client typically
   folds the data in the response into whatever local evaluation logic
   it applies to decide what disposition the content deserves.


3.  High-Level Architecture

   A reputation mechanism functions as a component of an overall
   service.  A current example is that of an email system that uses
   DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM; see [DKIM]) to affix a stable
   identifier to a message and then uses that as a basis for evaluation:

              Figure 1: Actors in a Trust Sequence Using DKIM

   (See [EMAIL-ARCH] for a general description of the Internet messaging
   architecture.)  In this figure, the solid lines indicate the flow of
   a message; the dotted line indicates transfer of validated
   identifiers within the message content; and the double line shows the
   query and response of the reputation information.

   Here, the DKIM Service provides one or more stable identifiers that
   is the basis for the reputation query.  On receipt of a message from
   an MTA, the DKIM Service provides a (possibly empty) set of validated
   identifiers -- domain names, in this case -- which are the subjects
   of reputation queries made by the Identity Assessor.  The Identity
   Assessor queries a Reputation Service to determine the reputation of
   the provided identifiers, and delivers the identifiers and their
   reputations to the Handling Filter.  The Handling Filter makes a
   decision about whether and how to deliver the message to the
   recipient based on these and other inputs about the message, possibly
   including evaluation mechansisms in addition to DKIM.

   This document outlines the reputation query and response mechanism.
   It provides the following definitions:

   o  Vocabulary for the current work and work of this type;

   o  The types and content of queries that can be supported;

   o  The extensible range of response information that can be provided;

   o  A query/response protocol;

   o  Query/response transport conventions.

   It provides an extremely simple query/response model that can be
   carried over a variety of transports, including the Domain Name
   System.  (Although not typically thought of as a 'transport', the DNS
   provides generic capabilities and can be thought of as a mechanism
   for transporting queries and responses that have nothing to do with
   Internet addresses, such as is one with a DNS BlockList [DNSBL].)
   Each specification for Repute transport is independent of any other
   specification.  A diagram of the basic query service is found in
   Figure 2.

   The precise syntaxes of both the query and response are application-
   specific.  An application of the model defines the parameters
   available to queries of that type, and also defines the data returned
   in response to any query.


4.  Terminology and Definitions

   This section defines terms used in the rest of the document.

4.1.  Response Set

   A "Response Set" comprises those data that are returned in response
   to a reputation query about a particular entity.  The types of data
   are specific to an application; the data returned in the evaluation
   of email senders would be different than the reputation data returned
   about a movie or a baseball player.

   Response Sets have symbolic names, and these have to be registered
   with IANA, in the Reputation Applications Registry, to prevent name
   collisions.  IANA registries are created in a separate document.
   Each definition of a Response Set also needs to define its registry
   entry.

Internet-Draft         Reputation Reporting Model              July 2013


4.2.  Reputon

   A "reputon" is an object that comprises the basic response to a
   reputation query.  It contains the response set relevant to the
   subject of the query.  Its specific encoding is left to documents
   that implement this model.


5.  Information Represented in a Response Set

   The basic information to be represented in the protocol is fairly
   simple, and includes the following:

   o  the identity of the entity providing the reputation information;

   o  the identity of the entity being rated;

   o  the application context for the query (e.g., email address
      evaluation);

   o  the overall rating score for that entity;

   o  the level of confidence in the accuracy of that rating; and

   o  the number of data points underlying that score.

   Beyond this, arbitrary amounts of additional information might be
   provided for specific uses of the service.  The entire collection is
   the Response Set for that application.  The query/response protocol
   defines a syntax for representing such Response Sets, but each
   application defines its own Response Set. Thus, the basic information
   also includes the name of the application for which the reputation
   data is being expressed.

   Each application requires its own specification of the Response Set.
   For example, a specification might be needed for a reputation
   Response Set for an "email-sending-domain"; the Response Set might
   include information on how often spam was received from that domain.
   Additional documents define a [MIME] type for reputation data, and
   protocols for exchanging such data.


6.  Information Flow in the Reputation Query Protocol

   The basic Response Set could be wrapped into a new MIME media type
   [MIME] or a DNS RR, and transported accordingly.  It also could be
   the integral payload of a purpose-built protocol.  For a basic
   request/response scenario, one entity (the Client) will ask a second



Borenstein, et al.      Expires January 13, 2014                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         Reputation Reporting Model              July 2013


   entity (the Server) for reputation data about a third entity (the
   Target), and the second entity will respond with that data.

   An application might benefit from an extremely lightweight mechanism,
   supporting constrained queries and responses, while others might need
   to support larger and more complex responses.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document presents no actions for IANA.

   [RFC Editor: Please remove this section prior to publication.]


8.  Privacy Considerations

8.1.  Data In Transit

   Some kinds of reputation data are sensitive, and should not be shared
   publicly.  For cases that have such sensitivity, it is imperative to
   protect the information from unauthorized access and viewing.  The
   model described here neither suggests nor precludes any particular
   transport mechanism for the data.  However, for the purpose of
   illustration, a reputation service that operates over HTTP might
   employ any of its well-known mechanisms to solve these problems,
   which include OpenPGP [OPENPGP], Transport Layer Security [TLS], and
   S/MIME [SMIME].

8.2.  Collection Of Data

   The basic notion of collection and storage of reputation data is
   obviously a privacy issue in that the opinions of one party about
   another are likely to be sensitive.  Inadvertent or unauthorized
   exposure of those data can lead to personal or commercial damage.


9.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces an overall protocol model, but no
   implementation details.  As such, the security considerations
   presented here are very high-level.  The detailed analyses of the
   various specific components of the protocol can be found the
   documents that instantiate this model.

Internet-Draft         Reputation Reporting Model              July 2013


9.1.  Biased Reputation Agents

   As with [VBR], an agent seeking to make use of a reputation reporting
   service is placing some trust that the service presents an unbiased
   "opinion" of the object about which reputation is being returned.
   The result of trusting the data is, presumably, to guide action taken
   by the reputation client.  It follows, then, that bias in the
   reputation service can adversely affect the client.  Clients
   therefore need to be aware of this possibility and the effect it
   might have.  For example, a biased system returning a reputation
   about a DNS domain found in email messages could result in the
   admission of spam, phishing or malware through a mail gateway (by
   rating the domain name more favourably than warranted) or could
   result in the needless rejection or delay of mail (by rating the
   domain more unfavourably than warranted).  As a possible mitigation
   strategy, clients might seek to interact only with reputation
   services that offer some disclosure of the computation methods for
   the results they return.  Such disclosure and evaluation is beyond
   the scope of the present document.

   Similarly, a client placing trust in the results returned by such a
   service might suffer if the service itself is compromised, returning
   biased results under the control of an attacker without the knowledge
   of the agency providing the reputation service.  This might result
   from an attack on the data being returned at the source, or from a
   man-in-the-middle attack.  Protocols, therefore, need to be designed
   so as to be as resilient against such attacks as possible.

9.2.  Malformed Messages

   Both clients and servers of reputation systems need to be resistant
   to attacks that involve malformed messages, deliberate or otherwise.
   Malformations can be used to confound clients and servers alike in
   terms of identifying the party or parties responsible for the content
   under evaluation.  This can result in delivery of undesirable or even
   dangerous content.

9.3.  Further Discussion

   Numerous other topics related to use and management of reputation
   systems can be found in [I-D.REPUTE-CONSIDERATIONS].
