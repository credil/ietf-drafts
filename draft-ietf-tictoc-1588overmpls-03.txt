            Transporting Timing messages over MPLS Networks
                   draft-ietf-tictoc-1588overmpls-03

Abstract

   This document defines the method for transporting Timing messages
   such as PTP and NTP over an MPLS network.  The method allows for the
   easy identification of these PDUs at the port level to allow for port
   level processing of these PDUs in both LERs and LSRs.

   The basic idea is to transport Timing messages inside dedicated MPLS
   LSPs.  These LSPs only carry timing messages and possibly Control and
   Management packets, but they do not carry customer traffic.

   Two methods for transporting Timing messages over MPLS are defined.
   The first method is to transport Timing messages directly over the
   dedicated MPLS LSP via UDP/IP encapsulation, which is suitable for
   MPLS networks.  The second method is to transport Timing messages
   inside a PW via Ethernet encapsulation, which is suitable for both
   MPLS and MPLS-TP networks.

1.  Introduction

   The objective of Precision Time Protocol (PTP) and Network Timing
   Protocol (NTP) are to synchronize independent clocks running on
   separate nodes of a distributed system.

   [IEEE] defines PTP messages for frequency, phase and time
   synchronization.  The PTP messages include PTP PDUs over UDP/IP
   (Annex D and E of [IEEE]) and PTP PDUs over Ethernet (Annex F of
   [IEEE- 1588]).  This document defines mapping and transport of the
   PTP messages defined in [IEEE] over MPLS/MPLS-TP networks.  PTP
   defines several clock types: ordinary clocks, boundary clocks, end-
   to-end transparent clocks, and peer-to-peer transparent clocks.
   Transparent clocks require intermediate nodes to update correction
   field inside PTP message that reflects the transit time in the node.

   [RFC5905] defines NTP messages for clock and time synchronization.
   The PTP messages (PDUs) are transported over UDP/IP.  This document
   defines mapping and transport of the NTP messages defined in
   [RFC5905] over MPLS networks.

   One key attribute of all of these Timing messages is that the
   Timestamp processing should occur as close as possible to the actual
   transmission and reception at the physical port interface.  This
   targets optimal time and/or frequency recovery by avoiding variable
   delay introduced by queues internal to the clocks.

   To facilitate the fast and efficient recognition of Timing messages
   at the port level when the Timing messages are carried over MPLS
   LSPs, this document defines the specific encapsulations that should
   be used.  In addition, it can be expected that there will exist LSR/
   LERs where only a subset of the physical ports will have the port-
   based Timing message processing capabilities.  In order to ensure
   that the LSPs carrying Timing packets always enter and exit ports
   with this capability, routing extensions are defined to advertise
   this capability on a port basis and to allow for the establishment of
   LSPs that only transit such ports.  While this path establishment
   restriction may be applied only at the LER Ingress and/or egress
   ports, it becomes more important when using transparent clock capable
   LSRs in the path.

   Port based Timing message processing involves Timing message
   recognition.  Once the Timing messages are recognized they can be
   modified based on the reception or transmission timestamp.

   This document provides two methods for transporting Timing messages
   over MPLS.  One is applicable to MPLS environment and the other one
   is applicable to both MPLS and MPLS-TP environment.

Internet-Draft        Transporting Timing over MPLS         October 2012


   The solution involves transporting Timing messages over dedicated
   LSPs called Timing LSPs.  These LSPs carry Timing messages and MAY
   carry Management and control messages, but not data plane client
   traffic.  Timing LSPs can be established statically or via signaling.
   Extensions to control plane (OSPF, ISIS, etc) is required to enable
   routers to distribute their Timing processing capabilities over MPLS
   to other routers.  However such extensions are outside the scope of
   this document.

   Extensions to signaling protocols (e.g., RSVP-TE) are required for
   establishing PTP LSPs.  However such extensions are outside the scope
   of this document.

   While the techniques included herein allow for the establishment of
   paths optimized to include Time-stamping capable links, the
   performance of the Slave clocks is outside the scope of this
   document.

3.  Problem Statement

   [IEEE] has defined methods for transporting PTP messages over
   Ethernet and IP networks.  [RFC5905] has defined the method of
   transporting NTP messages over IP networks.  There is a need to
   transport Timing messages over MPLS networks while supporting the
   Transparent Clock (TC), Boundary Clock (BC) and Ordinary Clock (OC)
   functionality in the LER and LSRs in the MPLS network.

   There are multiple ways of transporting Timing over MPLS.  However,
   there is a requirement to limit the possible encapsulation options to
   simplify the Timing message identification and processing required at
   the port level.

   When Timing-awareness is needed, Timing messages should not be
   transported over LSPs or PWs that are carrying customer traffic
   because LSRs perform Label switching based on the top label in the
   stack.  To detect Timing messages inside such LSPs require special
   hardware to do deep packet inspection at line rate.  Even if such
   hardware exists, the payload cant be deterministically identified by
   LSRs because the payload type is a context of the PW label, and the
   PW label and its context are only known to the Edge routers (PEs/
   LERs); LSRs dont know what is a PWs payload (Ethernet, ATM, FR, CES,
   etc).  Even if one restricts an LSP to only carry Ethernet PWs, the
   LSRs dont have the knowledge of whether PW Control Word (CW) is
   present or not and therefore can not deterministically identify the
   payload.

   A generic method is defined in this document that does not require
   deep packet inspection at line rate, and can deterministically
   identify Timing messages.  The generic method is applicable to MPLS
   and MPLS-TP networks.

4.  Timing over MPLS Architecture

   Timing messages are exchange between Timing ports on ordinary and
   boundary clocks.  Boundary clocks terminate the Timing messages and
   act as master for other boundary clocks or for slave clocks.
   Transparent clocks do not terminate the Timing messages but they do
   modify the contents of the Timing messages as they transit across the
   transparent clock.

   Master/Slave clock could be integrated in the LERs.  An example is
   shown in Figure 1, where the LERs act as Ordinary Clock (OC) and are
   the initiating/terminating point for Timing messages.  The ingress
   LER encapsulates the Timing messages in Timing LSP and the Egress LER
   terminates the Timing LSP.  The LSRs act as Transparent Clock (TC)
   and just update the Timing field in the Timing messages.

   LERs could also act as Boundary Clock (BC).  This is shown in Figure
   2, where LERs terminate the Timing messages received from switch/
   routers that are outside of the MPLS network acting as OC or BC.  In
   this example LERs regenerate the clock and initiate timing messages
   encapsulated in Timing LSP toward the MPLS network, while the LSRs
   act as Transparent Clock (TC) and just update the Timing field in the
   Timing messages, which are already encapsulated in Timing LSPs.

   LERs could also act as Transparent Clock (TC).  This is shown in
   Figure 3, where LERs do not terminate the Timing messages received
   from switch/routers that are outside of the MPLS network acting as
   OC, TC or BC.  The LERs act as TC and update the Timing field in the
   Timing messages as they transit the LER, while encapsulating them in
   timing LSP.  The LSRs also act as Transparent Clock (TC) and just
   update the Timing field in the Timing messages which are already
   encapsulated in Timing LSPs.

5.  Dedicated LSPs for Timing messages

   Many methods have been considered for identifying the Timing messages
   when they are encapsulated in MPLS such as using GAL/ACH or a new
   reserved label.  These methods were not attractive since they either
   required deep packet inspection at line rate in the intermediate LSRs
   or they required use of a scarce new reserved label.  Also one of the
   goals was to reuse existing OAM mechanisms.

   The method defined in this document can be used by LER and LSRs to
   identify Timing messages in MPLS tunnels by just looking at the top
   label in the MPLS label stack, which only carry Timing messages as
   well as OAM, but not data plane client traffic.

   Compliant implementations MUST use dedicated LSPs to carry Timing
   messages over MPLS.  These LSPs are herein referred to as "Timing
   LSPs" and the labels associated with these LSPs as "Timing LSP
   labels".  The Timing LSPs that runs between Ingress and Egress LERs
   MUST be co-routed.  Alternatively, a single bidirectional co-routed
   LSP can be used.

   Co-routing of the two directions is required to limit the difference
   in the delays in the Master clock to Slave clock direction compared
   to the Slave clock to Master clock direction.  The Timing LSP MAY be
   MPLS LSP or MPLS-TP LSP.

   The Timing LSPs could be configured or signaled via RSVP-TE/GMPLS.
   New Extensions to RSVP-TE/GMPLS TLVs are required; however they are
   outside the scope of this document.

   The Timing LSPs MAY carry essential MPLS/MPLS-TP OAM traffic such as
   BFD and LSP Ping but the LSP data plane client plane traffic MUST be
   Timing packets only.

6.  Timing over LSP Encapsulation

   This document defines two methods for carrying Timing messages over
   MPLS.  The first method is carrying UDP/IP encapsulated Timing
   messages over Timing LSPs, which is suitable for MPLS networks and
   the second method, is carrying Ethernet encapsulated Timing messages
   over Ethernet PWs inside Timing LSPs, which is suitable for MPLS and
   MPLS-TP networks.

6.1.  Timing over UDP/IP over MPLS Encapsulation

   The simplest method of transporting Timing messages over MPLS is to
   encapsulate Timing PDUs in UDP/IP and then encapsulate them in Timing
   LSP.  This format is shown in Figure 4.


                    +----------------------+
                    |   Timing LSP Label   |
                    +----------------------+
                    |        IPv4/6        |
                    +----------------------+
                    |         UDP          |
                    +----------------------+
                    |     Timing PDU       |
                    +----------------------+

      Figure (4) - Timing over UDP/IP over MPLS Encapsulation


   This encapsulation is very simple and is useful when the network
   between Timing Master Clock and Slave Clock is MPLS network.

   In order for an LER/LSR to process Timing messages, the Timing LSP
   Label must be at the top label of the label stack.  The LER/LSR MUST
   know that the Timing LSP Label is used for carrying Timing messages.
   This can be accomplished via static configuration or via RSVP-TE
   signaling.

   The UDP/IP encapsulation of PTP MUST follow Annex D and E of [IEEE].
   While the UDP/IP encapsulation of NTP MUST follow [RFC5905].

6.2.  Timing over PW Encapsulation

   Another method of transporting Timing over MPLS networks is by
   encapsulating Timing PDUs in PW which in turn is transported over
   Timing LSPs.  In case of PTP, Ethernet PW encapsulation [RFC4448],
   shown in Fig 5(A) MUST be used and the Ethernet encapsulation of PTP

   The Tagged mode defined in [RFC-4448] MUST be used and the Payload
   MUST have 2 VLAN tags (S-VLAN and C-VLAN).  The Timing over PW
   encapsulation MUST use the Control Word (CW) as specified in
   [RFC4448] to ensure proper detection of PTP messages inside the MPLS
   packets for Timing over LSP and Timing over PW encapsulation.  The
   use of Sequence Number in the CW is optional.

   Timing over PW encapsulation for NTP MUST use NTP over UDP/IP over PW
   (the IP PW discussed in [RFC4447]) shown in Fig 5(B).

              Figure (5) - Timing over PW Encapsulations

   In order for an LSR to process PTP messages, the top label of the
   label stack (the Tunnel Label) MUST be a Timing label.

   The PW method of transporting Timing over MPLS is applicable to both
   MPLS and MPLS-TP networks.

6.3.  Other Timing Encapsulation methods

   In future other timing encapsulation methods may be introduced, such
   as a new shim header after the Bottom of Stack to carry the Timing
   information.  Such new encapsulations are outside the scope of this
   document.  The control and signaling requirements in this document
   are defined generically enough to accommodate any such new
   encapsulations.

7.  Timing Message Processing

   Each Timing protocol such as PTP and NTP, define their set of Timing
   messages.  For example PTP defines SYNC, DELAY_REQ, DELAY_RESP,
   FOLLOW_UP, etc messages.

   Some of the Timing messages require time stamping at port level and
   some dont.  It is the job of the LER/LSR to parse the timing message
   and find out the type of the Timing message and decide whether and
   how to Time- stamp it (e.g., BC) or modify existing timestamp in it
   (e.g., TC).

   For example the following PTP messages (called Event messages)
   require time-stamping, while other Non-Event PTP messages do not need
   time-stamping.

   o  Announce

   o  SYNC

   o  DELAY_REQ (Delay Request)

   o  PDELAY_REQ (Peer Delay Request)

   o  PDELAY_RESP (Peer Delay Response)

   SYNC and DELAY_REQ are exchanged between Master Clock and Slave Clock
   and MUST be transported over PTP LSPs.  PDELAY_REQ and PDELAY_RESP
   are exchanged between adjacent PTP clocks (i.e.  Master, Slave,
   Boundary, or Transparent) and MAY be transported over single hop PTP
   LSPs.  If Two Step PTP clocks are present, then the FOLLOW_UP,
   DELAY_RESP, and PDELAY_RESP_FOLLOW_UP messages must also be
   transported over the PTP LSPs.

   For a given instance of 1588 protocol, SYNC and DELAY_REQ MUST be
   transported over two PTP LSPs that are in opposite directions.  These
   PTP LSPs, which are in opposite directions MUST be congruent and co-
   routed.  Alternatively, a single bidirectional co-routed LSP can be
   used.

   Except as indicated above for the two-step PTP clocks, Non-Event PTP
   message types do not need to be processed by intermediate routers.
   These message types MAY be carried in PTP Tunnel LSPs.

8.  Protection and Redundancy

   In order to ensure continuous uninterrupted operation of slave
   clocks, usually as a general practice, slave clocks (or ports) track
   redundant master clocks.

   It is the responsibility of the network operator to ensure that
   physically disjoint Timing LSPs are established between a slave clock
   (or port) and redundant master clocks (or ports).

   When a slave clock (or port) listens to redundant master clocks or
   ports, any prolonged Timing LSP outage will trigger the slave clock
   or port to switch to a redundant master clock or port.

   LSP/PW protection such as Linear protection Switching (1:1, 1+1),
   Ring protection switching or MPLS Fast Reroute (FRR) generally switch
   alternative path that usually cause a change in delay, which if
   undetected by slave clock can reduce accuracy of the slave clock.
   However it is expected that most Slave clocks could detect the change
   in delay.  Therefore this specification recommends that protection
   switching SHOULD be used, unless the operator knows that the
   protection switching may have adverse effect on the slave clock.

   Note that any protection or reroute mechanism that adds additional
   MPLS label to the label stack, such as Facility Backup Fast Reroute,
   MUST ensure that the pushed label is also a Timing Label to ensure
   recognition of the MPLS frame as containing Timing messages, as it
   transits the backup path.

9.  ECMP

   To ensure the optimal operation of slave clocks and avoid error
   introduced by forward and reverse path delay asymmetry, the physical
   path for Timing messages from master clock to slave Clock and vice
   versa must be the same for all Event Timing messages listed in
   section 7.

   Therefore the Timing LSPs MUST not be subject to ECMP (Equal Cost
   Multipath).

10.  PHP

   To ensure that the label on the top of the label stack is the Timing
   LSP Label, PHP MUST not be used.

11.  Entropy

   To ensure all Timing messages in a Timing LSP take the same path,
   Entropy MUST NOT be used for the Timing LSP [mpls-entropy] and
   Entropy MSUT NOT be used for the PWs that are carried inside Timing
   LSP [RFC6391].

12.  OAM, Control and Management

   IIn order to manage Timing LSPs and their encapsulated PWs, they MUST
   be able to carry OAM and management messages.  These management
   messages MUST be differentiated from Timing messages via already
   defined IETF methods.

   For example BFD [RFC5880], [RFC5884] and LSP-Ping [RFC4389] MAY run
   over PTP LSPs via UDP/IP encapsulation or via GAL/G-ACH.  These
   Management protocols can easily be identified by the UDP Destination
   Port number or by GAL/ACH respectively.

   Also BFD, LSP-Ping and other management messages MAY run over the PWs
   encapsulated in Timing LSP via one of the defined VCCVs (Type 1, 3 or
   4) [RFC5085] (note that VCCV Type 2 using Router Alert Label is going
   to be deprecated by IETF).  In this case G-ACH, PW label (TTL=1) or
   GAL-ACH are used to identify such management messages.

13.  QoS Considerations

   In network deployments where not every LSR/LER is Timing-aware, it is
   important to reduce the impact of the non-Timing-aware LSR/LERs on
   the timing recovery in the slave clock.  The Timing messages are time
   critical and must be treated with the highest priority.  Therefore
   Timing over MPLS messages must be treated with the highest priority
   in the routers.  This can be achieved by proper setup of Timing LSPs.

   It is recommended that the Timing LSPs are setup or configured
   properly to indicate EF-PHB [RFC3246]for the CoS and Green [RFC2697]
   for drop eligibility.

14.  FCS Recalculation

   When timestamp generation and timing packet adjustment is performed
   near the physical port hardware, the process MUST include
   recalculation of the Ethernet FCS.  Also FCS retention for the
   payload Ethernet described in [RFC4720] MUST NOT be used.

15.  UDP Checksum Correction

   For UDP/IP encapsulation mode of Timing over MPLS, the UDP checksum
   is optional when used for IPv4 encapsulation and mandatory in case of
   IPv6.

   When UDP checksum is used, each Timing-aware LER/LSR must either
   incrementally update the UDP checksum after Time stamping or
   Correction Field update or verify the UDP checksum on reception from
   upstream and recalculate the checksum completely on transmission to
   downstream node after Time stamping or Correction Field update.

16.  Routing extensions for Timing-aware Routers

   MPLS-TE routing relies on extensions to OSPF [RFC2328] [RFC5340] and
   IS-IS [ISO] [RFC1195] in order to advertise Traffic Engineering (TE)
   link information used for constraint-based routing.

   Indeed, it is useful to advertise data plane TE router link
   capabilities, such as the capability for a router to be Timing-aware.
   This capability MUST then be taken into account during path
   computation to prefer or even require links that advertise themselves
   as Timing-aware.  In this way the path can ensure the entry and exit
   points into the LERs and, if desired, the links into the LSRs are
   able to perform port based timestamping thus minimizing their impact
   on the performance of the slave clock.

   extensions are required to OSPF and IS-IS in order to advertise
   Timing-aware capabilities of a link.  Such extensions are outside the
   scope of this document; however such extension SHOULD be able to
   signal the following information per Router Link:

   o  Capable of processing PTP, NTP or other Timing flows

   o  Capable of performing Transparent Clock operation

   o  Capable of performing Boundary Clock operation

Internet-Draft        Transporting Timing over MPLS         October 2012


17.  Signaling Extensions for Creating Timing LSPs

   RSVP-TE signaling MAY be used to setup the timing LSPs.  When RSVP-TE
   is used to setup Timing LSPs, some information that indicates that
   the LSP is carrying Timing flows MUST be included in the new
   Extensions to RSVP-TE:

   The following information MAY also be included in the new Extensions
   to RSVP-TE:

   o  Offset from Bottom of Stack (BoS) to the start of the Timestamp
      field

   o  Number of VLANs in case of PW encapsulation

   o  Timestamp field Type

      *  Correction Field, Timestamp

   o  Timestamp Field format

      *  64-bit PTPv1, 80-bit PTPv2, 32-bit NTP, 64-bit NTP, 128-bit
         NTP, etc.

   Note that in case the above optional information is signaled with
   RSVP-TE for a Timing LSP, all the Timing packets carried in that LSP
   must have the same signaled characteristics.  For example if
   Timestamp format is signaled as 64-bit PTPv1, then all Timing packets
   must use 64-bit PTPv1 timestamp.

18.  Behavior of LER/LSR

   Timing-capable/aware LERs and LSRs are routers that have one or more
   interfaces that can perform Timing operations (OC/BC/TC) on Timing
   packets and are configured to do so.  Timing-capable/aware LERs and
   LSRs can advertise their Timing-capability per-interface via control
   plane such as OSPF or IS-IS.  The Timing-capable/aware LERs can then
   signals Timing LSPs via RSVP-TE signaling.  Alternatively the Timing
   capability of LER and LSRs may be configured in a centralized
   controller and the Timing LSP may be setup using manual configuration
   or other methods such as SDN.

18.1.  Behavior of Timing-capable/aware LER

   When a Timing-capable/aware LER behaves as a Transparent clock and
   receives a Timing message from a Timing-capable/aware non-MPLS
   interface, the LER updates the Correction Field (CF) and encapsulates
   and forwards the timing message over previously established Timing
   LSP.  Also when a Timing message is received from a Timing-capable/
   aware MPLS interface, LER updates the Correction Filed (CF) and
   decapsulates the MPLS encapsulation and forwards the timing message
   to a non-MPLS interface.

   When a Timing-capable/aware LER behaves as a Boundary clock and
   receives a Timing message from a Timing-capable/aware non MPLS
   interface, the LER Timestamps the Timing packet and sends it to the
   LERs Boundary clock processing module.  Also when a Timing message is
   received from a Timing- capable/aware MPLS interface, the LER
   Timestamps the Timing packet and sends it to the LERs Boundary clock
   processing module.

   When a Timing-capable/aware LER behaves as an Ordinary Clock toward
   the MPLS network, and receives a Timing message from a Timing-
   capable/aware MPLS interface, the LER Timestamps the Timing packet
   and sends it to the LERs Ordinary clock processing module.

18.2.  Behavior of Timing-capable/aware LSR

   A Timing-capable/aware LSR behaves as a Transparent clock and
   receives a Timing message from a Timing-capable/aware MPLS interface.
   The LSR updates the Correction Filed (CF) and forwards the timing
   message over another MPLS interface.

18.3.  Behavior of non-Timing-capable/aware LSR

   It is most beneficial when all LSRs in the path of a Timing LSP be
   timing-Capable/aware LSRs.  This would ensure the highest quality
   time and clock synchronization by Timing Slave Clocks.  However, this

   specification does not mandate that all LSRs in path of a Timing LSP
   be Timing- capable/aware.

   Non-Timing-capable/aware LSRs just switch the packets encapsulated in
   Timing LSPs and dont perform any Timing operation (TC).  However as
   explained in QoS section the Timing8 over MPLS packets MUST be still
   be treated with the highest priority based on their Traffic Class
   (TC) marking.

19.  Other considerations

   [IEEE] Tdefines an optional peer-to-peer Transparent clocking that
   requires peer delay measurement between two adjacent Timing-capable/
   ware routers/switches.  Peer delay measurement messages need to be
   time stamped and terminated by the Timing-capable/aware routers/
   switches.  This means that two adjacent LSRs may be engaged in a peer
   delay measurement.  Such peer delay measurement messages SHALL NOT
   use the Timing LSP that runs between two LERs.  For transporting such
   peer delay measurement messages there are two options.  Either a
   single-hop LSP needs to be created between the two adjacent LSRs
   engaged in peer delay measurement to carry peer delay measurement
   messages, or other methods such as PTP transport over Ethernet may be
   used for transporting peer delay measurement messages if the link
   between the two routers is Ethernet.

   The use of Explicit Null Label (Label= 0 or 2) is acceptable as long
   as either the Explicit Null label is the bottom of stack label
   (applicable only to UDP/IP encapsulation) or the label below the
   Explicit Null label is a PTP label.

20.  Security Considerations

   MPLS PW security considerations in general are discussed in [RFC3985]
   and [RFC4447],and those considerations also apply to this document.

   An experimental security protocol is defined in [IEEE].The PTP
   security extension and protocol provides group source authentication,
   message integrity, and replay attack protection for PTP messages.

21.  Applicability Statement

   The Timing over MPLS transport methods described in this document
   apply to the following network Elements:

   o  An LER receives IP or Ethernet Encapsulated Timing messages from a
      non-MPLS interface and forwards them as MPLS encapsulated Timing
      messages over Timing LSP, while performing Transparent Clock
      functionality

   o  An LER receives MPLS encapsulated Timing messages from a Timing
      LSP and forwards them to non-MPLS interface as IP or Ethernet
      Encapsulated Timing messages, while performing Transparent Clock
      functionality

   o  An LER receives MPLS encapsulated Timing messages from a Timing
      LSP and terminates them, while performing the OC or BC
      functionality

   o  An LSR receives MPLS encapsulated Timing messages from a Timing
      LSP and forwards them to another MPLS interface, while performing
      the TC functionality

   This document also supports the case where not all LSRs are Timing-
   capable/aware.  It also supports the case where not all LER/LSR
   interfaces are Timing-capable/aware.
