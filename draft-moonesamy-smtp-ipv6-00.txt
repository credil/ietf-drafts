1. Introduction

   This memo discusses about SMTP in an IPv4/IPv6 dual stack
   environment.  It contains a specific interpretation, initially
   specified in RFC 3974, of the applicability of the MX processing
   algorithm in RFC 5321, Section 5, to dual-stack environments.
   Implementers are cautioned that they must reference RFC 5321 for the
   full algorithm; in case of ambiguity, RFC 5321 is authoritative.

   This memo obsoletes RFC 3974 [RFC3974].

2. SMTP Sender Algorithm in a Dual-Stack Environment

   The algorithm for a dual-stack SMTP sender is basically the same as
   that for an IPv4-only SMTP client, but it now includes AAAA lookups
   of DNS MX records for SMTP-over-IPv6 relaying.  IPv4/IPv6 dual stack
   destinations should be treated just like multihomed destinations, as
   described in RFC 5321 [RFC5321], Section 5.

   Once an SMTP client lexically identifies a domain to which mail will
   be delivered for processing (as described in RFC 5321 Sections 2.3.5
   and 3.6), a DNS lookup must be performed to resolve the domain name
   (RFC 1035 [RFC1035]).  The names are expected to be fully-qualified
   domain names (FQDNs): mechanisms for inferring FQDNs from partial
   names or local aliases are outside of this specification.

   (1) As specified in RFC 5321, the lookup first attempts to locate an
       MX RR associated with the name.  If a CNAME record is found, the
       resulting name is processed as if it were the initial name.  If a
       non-existent domain error is returned, this situation must be
       reported as an error.  If a temporary error is returned, the
       message must be queued and retried later (see RFC 5321 Section
       4.5.4.1).  If an empty list of MXs is returned, the address is
       treated as if it was associated with an implicit MX RR, with a
       preference of 0, pointing to that host.  If MX RRs are present,
       but none of them are usable, or the implicit MX RR is unusable,
       this situation must be reported as an error.

   (2)  Compare each host name in MX RR with the names of the sending
        host.  If there is match, drop MX RRs which have an equal or
        larger value than the lowest-preference matching MX RR
        (including itself).  If multiple MX RRs remain, sort the MX RRs
        in ascending order based on their preference values.  Loop over
        steps (3) to (9) on each host name in MX  RR in a sequence.  If
        no MX RRs remain, the SMTP client must be the primary MX host.
        Other routing rules should be applied. Finish.

   (3)  If the sending MTA has IPv4 capability, lookup the A RR.

        Keep the resulting addresses until step (5).

   (4)  If the sending MTA has IPv6 capability, lookup the AAAA RRs.

   (5)  If there is no A or AAAA RR present, try the next MX RR (go to
        step (3)).  Note that the next MX RR could have the same
        preference.

        NOTE: If one or more address RRs are found, an implementation
        may sort addresses RRs based on the implementation's preference
        of A or AAAA RR.  To encourage the transition from IPv4 to
        IPv6, AAAA RRs may take precedence.  The sorting may only
        reorder address RRs from MX RRs of the same preference.

   (6)  For each of the addresses, loop over steps (7) to (9).

   (7) An SMTP session is initiated with the SMTP client opening a
       connection to the SMTP server as specified in RFC 5321
       Section 3.1.  The SMTP client needs to adhere to the timeouts
       specified in RFC 5321 Section 4.5.3.2 and the sending strategy
       defined in RFC 5321 Section 4.5.4.1.

       If successful, go to step (9).

   (8)  If unsuccessful and there is another available address, try the
        next available address.  Go to step (7).  If all addresses are
        not reachable and if a list of MX RRs is being traversed,
        try the next MX RR (go to step (3)).  If there is no list of
        MX RRs, or if the end of the list of MX RRs has been
        reached, raise a temporary email delivery failure.  Finish.

   (9)  Attempt to deliver the email over the connection established, as
        specified in RFC 5321.  If a transient failure condition is
        reported, try the next MX RR (go to step (3)).  If an error
        condition is reported, raise a permanent email delivery error,
        and do not try further MX RR.  Finish.  If successful, SMTP
        delivery has succeeded.  Finish.


3. Security Considerations

   Section 7 of RFC 5321 discusses about the security considerations for
   SMTP implementations should provide the capability for filtering in
   an IPv6 environment similar to what is currently available in an IPv4
   environment.

4. IANA Considerations
