          LDP Extensions to Support Maximally Redundant Trees
                      draft-atlas-mpls-ldp-mrt-00

Abstract

   This document specifies extensions to LDP to support the creation of
   label-switched paths for Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT).  A prime
   use of MRTs is for unicast and multicast IP/LDP Fast-Reroute (MRT-
   FRR).

   The sole protocol extension to LDP is simply the ability to advertise
   an MRT Capability.  This document describes that extension and the
   associated behavior expected for LSRs and LERs advertising the MRT
   Capability.

   MRT-FRR uses LDP multi-topology extensions and requires three
   different multi-topology IDs to be allocated from the LDP MT-ID
   space.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the LDP signaling extension and associated
   behavior necessary to support the architecture that defines how IP/
   LDP Fast-Reroute can use MRTs [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture].
   It is necessary to read the architecture in
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture] to understand how and why the
   LDP extensions for behavior are needed.

Internet-Draft        LDP Extensions to Support MRT            July 2013


   At least one common standardized algorithm, such as the lowpoint
   algorithm explained and fully documented in
   [I-D.enyedi-rtgwg-mrt-frr-algorithm], is required so that the routers
   supporting MRT computation consistently compute the same MRTs.  LDP
   depends on the IGP to compute the MRTs and alternates; extensions to
   OSPF are defined in [I-D.atlas-ospf-mrt].

   MRT can also be used to protect multicast traffic via either global
   protection or local protection.[I-D.atlas-rtgwg-mrt-mc-arch] An MRT
   path can be used to provide node-protection for mLDP traffic via the
   mechanisms described in [I-D.wijnands-mpls-mldp-node-protection]; an
   MRT path can also be use to provide link protection for mLDP traffic.

   For each destination, IP/LDP Fast-Reroute with MRT (MRT-FRR) creates
   two alternate destination-based trees separate from the primary next-
   hop forwarding used during stable operation.  LDP uses the multi-
   topology extensions [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-multi-topology] to signal FECs
   for these two new forwarding topologies, known as MRT-Blue and MRT-
   Red.

   In order to create MRT paths and support IP/LDP Fast-Reroute, a new
   capability extension is needed for LDP.  An LDP implementation
   supporting MRT must also follow the described rules for originating
   and managing FECs related to MRT, as indicated by their multi-
   topology ID.  Network reconvergence is described in
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture] and the worst-cast network
   convergence time can be flooded via the extension in Section 7 of
   [I-D.atlas-ospf-mrt].

   IP/LDP Fast-Reroute using MRTs can provide 100% coverage for link and
   node failures in an arbitrary network topology where the failure
   doesn't split the network.  It can also be deployed incrementally; an
   MRT Island is formed of connected supporting routers and the MRTs are
   computed inside that island.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]

3.  Terminology

   For ease of reading, some of the terminology defined in
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture] is repeated here.

   Redundant Trees (RT):   A pair of trees where the path from any node
      X to the root R along the first tree is node-disjoint with the



Atlas, et al.           Expires January 13, 2014                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft        LDP Extensions to Support MRT            July 2013


      path from the same node X to the root along the second tree.
      These can be computed in 2-connected graphs.

   Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT):   A pair of trees where the path
      from any node X to the root R along the first tree and the path
      from the same node X to the root along the second tree share the
      minimum number of nodes and the minimum number of links.  Each
      such shared node is a cut-vertex.  Any shared links are cut-links.
      Any RT is an MRT but many MRTs are not RTs.  The two MRTs are
      referred to as MRT-Blue and MRT-Red.

   MRT Island:   From the computing router, the set of routers that
      support a particular MRT profile and are connected via MRT-
      eligible links.

   MRT-Red:   MRT-Red is used to describe one of the two MRTs; it is
      used to described the associated forwarding topology and MT-ID.
      Specifically, MRT-Red is the decreasing MRT where links in the
      GADAG are taken in the direction from a higher topologically
      ordered node to a lower one.

   MRT-Blue:   MRT-Blue is used to describe one of the two MRTs; it is
      used to described the associated forwarding topology and MT-ID.
      Specifically, MRT-Blue is the increasing MRT where links in the
      GADAG are taken in the direction from a lower topologically
      ordered node to a higher one.

   Rainbow MRT:   It is useful to have an MT-ID that refers to the
      multiple MRT topologies and to the default topology.  This is
      referred to as the Rainbow MRT MT-ID and is used by LDP to reduce
      signaling and permit the same label to always be advertised to all
      peers for the same (MT-ID, Prefix).

4.  Overview of LDP Signaling Extensions for MRT

   Routers need to know which of their neighbors support MRT.
   Supporting MRT indicates several different aspects of behavior, as
   listed below.

   1.  Support for Multi-Topology (MT) - this MAY also be indicated via
       the Multi-Capability MT Capability
       [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-multi-topology].

   2.  Understand the Rainbow MRT MT-ID and apply the associated labels
       to all relevant MT-IDs.

   3.  Advertise the Rainbow MRT MT-ID to the appropriate neighbors for
       the associated prefix.

Internet-Draft        LDP Extensions to Support MRT            July 2013


   4.  If acting as egress for a prefix in the default topology, also
       advertise and act as egress for the same prefix in MRT-Red and
       MRT-Blue.

   5.  For a FEC learned from a neighbor that does not support MRT,
       originate FECS for MRT-Red and MRT-Blue with the same prefix.

4.1.  MRT Capability Advertisement

   It is not possible to support MRT without supporting the LDP multi-
   topology extensions, but it is possible that the only use of the
   multi-topology extensions is for MRT.  In that case, a router MAY not
   negotiate the multi-topology capability and only negotiate the MRT
   Capability with its LDP peer.  Negotiation of the MT capability is
   not required with negotiation of the MRT capability.

   [EDITOR NOTE: How do we deal with different abilities for IPv4 and
   IPv6?  The MT capability has the Wildcard FEC to indicate this.  Do
   we just assume??]

   A new MRT Capability Parameter TLV is defined, which is defined in
   accordance with LDP Capability definition guidelines[RFC5561].

   The LDP MRT capability can be advertised during the LDP session
   initialization or after the LDP session is estblished.  Advertisement
   of the MRT capability indicates support of the procedures for
   establishing the MRT-Blue and MRT-Red LSP paths detailed in this
   document.  If the peer has not advertised the corresponding
   capability, then it indicates that LSR is not capable of supporting
   MRT procedures.

   The following is the format of the MRT Capability Parameter.

          0                   1                   2                   3
          0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |U|F| MRT Capability (IANA)     |      Length (= 1)             |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |S| Reserved    |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                         MRT Capability TLV Format

   Where:

   U- and F-bits:   MUST be 1 and 0, respectively, as per Section 3.
      (Signaling Extensions) of LDP Capabilities [RFC5561].

Internet-Draft        LDP Extensions to Support MRT            July 2013


   MRT Capability:   Capability TLV type (IANA assigned)

   S-bit:   MUST be 1 if used in LDP "Initialization" message.  MAY be
      set to 0 or 1 in dynamic "Capability" message to advertise or
      withdraw the capability respectively.

   Length:   The length (in octets) of TLV.  Its value is 1.

4.2.  Behavior Related to the Rainbow MRT MT-ID

   In Section 9 of [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture], the need to
   advertise different MPLS labels to different neighbors for the same
   FEC is described.  This can be shortly summarized as either
   advertising MRT MT-ID differentiated labels to a neighbor or just
   advertising the same MPLS label for the default topology, for MRT-Red
   and MRT-Blue.  MRT-supporting neighbors in the same domain as the
   default SPT next-hop get the differentiated MPLS labels; all other
   neighbors do not.

   A second use for the Rainbow MRT MT-ID is for an egress LER to send
   the Rainbow MRT MT-ID with an IMPLICIT_NULL label to indicate
   penultimate-hop-popping for all three types of FECs (IP Prefix FEC,
   MRT-Blue MT-IP Prefix FEC, and MRT-Red MT-IP Prefix FEC).

   An LSR advertising the MRT capability MUST recognize the Rainbow MRT
   MT-ID and associate the advertised label with the specific prefix for
   the default topology (MT-ID 0) and with the MRT-Red and MRT-Blue MT-
   IDs associated with all MRT Profiles that advertise LDP as the
   forwarding mechanism.

   An LSR is RECOMMENDED to use the Rainbow MRT MT-ID to reduce the
   amount of state and signaling required.

   As described in [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture], the
   recommended experimental value for the Rainbow MRT MT-ID is 3999.
   The final value will be assigned by IANA and allocated from the LDP
   MT-ID space.

4.3.  MRT-Blue and MRT-Red FECs

   To provide MRT support in LDP, the MT Prefix FEC is used.  For the
   default MRT Profile, an MRT-Blue FEC uses the MRT-Blue MT-ID value
   TBD3 allocated by IANA; for experimental purposes, the value 3998 is
   suggested.  For the default MRT Profile, an MRT-Red FEC uses the MRT-
   Red MT-ID value TBD2 allocated by IANA; for experimental purposes,
   the value 3997 is suggested.

Internet-Draft        LDP Extensions to Support MRT            July 2013


   The MT Prefix FEC encoding is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-multi-topology] and is used without alternation
   for signaling MRT-Blue, MRT-Red and Rainbow MRT FECs.

5.  LDP MRT FEC Advertisements

   This sections describes how and when labels for MRT-Red and MRT-Blue
   FECs are advertised.  The associated LSPs must be created before any
   failure occurs.

5.1.  Downstream Unsolicited Mode

   If the upstream session is negotiated with the MRT capability, the
   Egress LER advertises via a Rainbow MRT FEC an allocated MPLS label;
   this may be Explicit Null, Implicit Null, or another value.

   Based on the MRT algorithm [I-D.enyedi-rtgwg-mrt-frr-algorithm], the
   IGP computes the MRT-Red and MRT-Blue disjoint paths at Ingress and
   Transit LSRs.  Once the IGP computes the MRT-Red and MRT-Blue next-
   hops, LDP will advertise the Label Mapping for the MRT-Blue and MRT-
   Red FECs.  If a label is received from a downstream LSR for an MRT-
   Red or MRT-Blue FEC where the downstream LSR is capable of MRT, the
   MRT-Red FEC or MRT-Blue FEC label is swapped according to the
   received downstream label.  An LSR may also choose to use the MRT-Red
   or MRT-Blue path as an alternative for doing fast-reroute for the
   local traffic.

   When a downstream router is not capable of MRT, the LSR is an MRT
   Island Border Router (IBR) and SHOULD advertise Label Bindings for
   the MRT-Red FEC and MRT-Blue FEC as well as the associated normal
   topology.  The normal topology's primary next-hops will be used to
   forward traffic received for the MRT-Red FEC or the MRT-Blue FEC
   where the FEC's destination is outside the MRT Island.  This
   functionality is critical for partial deployment scenarios.

5.2.  Downstream On Demand Mode

   After the IGP computes the MRT-Red and MRT-Blue paths, the IGP MAY
   also decide to use either the MRT-Red or MRT-Blue path as a fast-
   reroute alternate for the particular FEC.  If so, then when in
   Downstream On Demand Mode, the LSR sends a Label Request for either
   the MRT-Red or MRT-Blue FEC to the downstream LSR.  The downstream
   LSR responds by either sending a Label Mapping if available or by
   sending a Label Request to its downstream LSR.  Once a Label Mapping
   is received, the associated label may be used as a fast-reroute
   alternative to forward IP and LDP traffic.

   A Label Mapping may be available in the following circumstances:



Atlas, et al.           Expires January 13, 2014                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        LDP Extensions to Support MRT            July 2013


   o  The LSR is acting as Egress

   o  A Label Mapping was already received from its downstream router

   o  A Label Mapping for the default topology FEC was received and the
      downstream router is not capable of MRT or is in a different MRT
      Island.

5.3.  Inter-Area

   As discussed in Section 4.2, the Rainbow MRT FEC is defined to
   facilitate signaling the same label for multiple topologies.
   Section 9 of [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture] recommends that
   traffic leaving an OSPF area or IS-IS level SHOULD use the default
   topology's shortest-path-tree next-hops instead of remaining on the
   MRT-Red or MRT-Blue paths.  If an LDP peer is in the same OSPF area
   or IS-IS level as the primary next-hop, then LDP SHOULD advertise
   different label values for a given set of MRT-Red FEC, MRT-Blue FEC,
   and FEC, unless Explicit-Null or Implicit-Null is appropriate.  If an
   LDP peer is in a different OSPF area or IS-IS level from the primary
   next-hop, then LDP SHOULD either advertise the same label value for
   the given set of MRT-Red FEC, MRT-Blue FEC, and FEC or advertise a
   single label for the Rainbow MRT FEC, whose behavior is defined in
   Section 4.2.

6.  Security Considerations

   This LDP extension is not believed to introduce new security
   concerns.  It relies upon the security architecture already provided
   for LDP.

7.  IANA Considerations

   New LDP Capability TLV: "MRT Capability" TLV (requested code point:
   TBA from LDP registry "TLV Type Name Space").  For interoperable
   experimental purposes, the value of ... is suggested.

   Allocations from the "LDP Multi-Topology (MT) ID Name Space"
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-multi-topology] under "LDP Parameter" namespace:

   o  Rainbow MRT MT-ID: TBD1

   o  default Profile MRT-Red MT-ID: TBD2 - requested under 4096 so it
      can also be signaled in PIM

   o  default Profile MRT-Blue MT-ID: TBD3 - requested under 4096 so it
      can also be signaled in PIM

Internet-Draft        LDP Extensions to Support MRT            July 2013


   For interoperable experiments, the following values are suggested for
   experimentation: Rainbow MRT MT-ID 3999, default MRT Profile MRT-Blue
   MT-ID 3998, default MRT Profile MRT-Red MT-ID 3997.  The MT-IDs are
   taken from the 3996-4096 range, which IS-IS defines as for private
   use, and which [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-multi-topology] does not specify as
   reserved (and MPLS list email suggests that range may be reserved for
   private use mapping from the IS-IS space).
