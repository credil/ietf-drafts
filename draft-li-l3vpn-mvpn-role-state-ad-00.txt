Abstract

   The document defines a new type of Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D route to
   advertise the role and corresponding primary/backup state for
   Multicast in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs.  The role-based state advertisement
   can help optimization of process in MPLS/BGP Multicast VPN to reduce
   unnecessary traffic replication and facilitate service provision.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC6513] defines the protocols and procedures for multicast in the
   BGP/MPLS IP VPN (Virtual Private Network) and [RFC6514]describes the
   BGP encodings and procedures for exchanging the information elements
   required by Multicast in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs.

   In MPLS/BGP Multicast VPN, there is close relation between the
   multicast service and the tunnel which bears the multicast service.
   The tunnel can be triggered to setup automatically after the auto-
   discovery of the leaf PEs.  This can facilitate the provision of the
   tunnels for multicast.  Or else, it will take much effort for the
   provision work which is troublesome and error-prone.  Based on the
   thinking, it is desirable that more information can be advertised
   along with the auto-discovery route which can optimize the provision
   of MPLS/BGP Multicast VPN.

   This document identifies the requirements to advertise the role and
   corresponding state for Multicast in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs and defines a
   new type of Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D route to achieve the object.  The
   role-based state advertisement can help optimization of multicast
   process to reduce unnecessary traffic replication and facilitate
   service provision in MPLS/BGP Multicast VPN .

2.  Terminology

   CE: Customer Edge

   PE: Provider Edge

   MVPN: Multicast VPN

3.  Motivations

3.1.  Easing Provision of mLDP P2MP LSP

   mLDP P2MP LSP can be used to bear multicast service in MPLS/BGP MVPN.
   It needs to send label mappings to the root to set up the P2MP LSP.
   So it has to specify the root node address on all leaf nodes for a
   specific P2MP LSP.  In MPLS/BGP MVPN, if the root/leaf role
   information of the PE in the MVPN can be advertised in the auto-
   discovery route, the leaf PE can directly trigger mLDP to send label
   mapping to the ingress PE of the MVPN without explicitly specifying
   the root address.  It can facilitate the provision of the MVPN when
   mLDP P2MP LSP is used.

3.2.  Reducing Unnecessary Traffic Replication

   There exist multi-homing scenarios in MPLS/BGP MVPN.  As shown in the
   figure 1, CE2 multi-homes to two PEs ( PE2 and PE3).  We assume PE1
   is the ingress PE and PE2/PE3 are the egress PEs for a specific MPLS/
   BGP MVPN.  If C-join is always sent from the CE2 to the PE2 for the
   MVPN, the multicast traffic sent from the PE1 to PE3 will be always
   dropped since there is not (C-S, C-G) entry in the MVPN on PE3.  If
   PE1 can learn that the remote PE would not forward the multicast
   traffic to any CE, the bandwidth can be saved in the network for PE1
   can stop to setup the ingress replication tunnel or P2MP LSPs to the
   remote PE or stop to replicate the unnecessary traffic to the tunnels
   to the remote PE.  In order to achieve the object, the primary or
   backup state for the leaf PE can be advertised.  As to a PE in a
   specific MVPN, the primary state means that it needs to forward the
   multicast traffic to the CE.  The backup state means it would not
   forward the multicast traffic to any CE.

3.3.  Local Protection of Egress Nodes

   [I-D.chen-mpls-p2mp-ingress-protection] and
   [I-D.chen-mpls-p2mp-egress-protection]proposes mechanisms for locally
   protecting ingress and egress nodes of MPLS TE P2MP LSPs.  In the
   mechanism for the local protection of egress nodes, the backup egress
   node needs to be designated for the primary egress node for a P2MP
   LSP.  The previous hop node of the primary egress node sets up a
   backup Sub-LSP from itself to the backup egress node after receiving
   the information about the backup egress node.  The provision of the
   local protection mechanism of egress nodes in P2MP LSPs can be
   facilitated in MPLS/BGP MVPN by advertising the primary/backup state
   and the protected egress node address with the auto-discovery route.
   When the ingress PE of the MVPN learns which egress PE can be used as
   the backup node to protect the primary egress node, it can directly
   trigger to set up the P2MP LSP with local protection of egress nodes.
   The method saves much provision effort since it need not statically
   designate the protection between the backup egress node and the
   primary egress node for a P2MP LSP.

4.  Protocol Extensions

   A new type of Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D route is defined for the MCAST-VPN
   NLRI.  It is called as Role-based Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D route.  Route
   Type for the A-D route is to be defined.

4.1.  Role-Based Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D route

   A Role-based Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D route type specific MCAST-VPN NLRI
   consists of the following:

                   |Protected Leaf's IP Addr(Optional) |
                   +-----------------------------------+


   The Route Distinguisher (RD) is encoded as described in [RFC4364].

   Originating Router's IP Addr is to advertising the originating PE's
   IPv4/IPv6 address.

   R field is one bit to identify if the PE is used as the root node in
   the MVPN.

   RS field is two bits to identify the primary/backup state if the PE
   is used as the root node.  There are three value for the RS field:

   -- 0 means the PE is used as the primary root node.

   -- 1 means the PE is used as the backup root node.  But the protected
   root node's IP address does not exist.

   -- 2 means the PE is used as the backup root node and there exists
   the protected root node's IP address.

   L field is one bit to identify if the PE is used as the leaf node in
   the MVPN.

   LS field is two bits to identify the primary/backup state if the PE
   is used as the leaf node.  There are three value for the LS field:

   -- 0 means the PE is used as the primary leaf node.

   -- 1 means the PE is used as the backup leaf node.  But the protected
   leaf node's IP address does not exist.

   -- 2 means the PE is used as the backup leaf node and there exists
   the protected leaf node's IP address.

   Protected Root's IP Addr is an optional field.  It specifies the IPv4
   /IPv6 address of the protected root node.  The field exists only when
   the value of the RS field is 2.

   Protected Leaf's IP Addr is an optional field.  It specifies the IPv4
   /IPv6 address of the protected leaf node.  The field exists only when
   the value of the LS field is 2.

Internet-Draft   Role-Based State Advertisement in MVPN        July 2013


5.1.  Advertisement of Role-base State for Root Nodes

   The Role-Based Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D route can be used to advertise the
   role and corresponding primary/backup state for root nodes in MPLS/
   BGP MVPN.

   If a PE is specified as the root PE for a specific MVPN, it MUST set
   the R bit as 1 in the A-D route.  Otherwise, the R bit MUST NOT be
   set.

   If the root PE is used as the backup ingress node to protect the
   primary root PE, the RS field in the A-D route MUST set as 1 when
   there is no determined root node to be protected.  In this case the
   primary root node protected by the backup root node can be calculated
   by all nodes according to some uniform algorithms which is out of the
   scope of this document.  When the RS field in the A-D route is set as
   1, the Protected Root's IP Addr field MUST NOT exist in the A-D
   route.

   If the root PE is used as the backup ingress node to protect the
   primary root PE, the RS field in the A-D route MUST set as 2 when
   there is a determined root node to be protected.  In this case the
   Protected Root's IP Addr field MUST exist in the A-D route which will
   specify the IPv4/IPv6 address of the protected root node.

   If the R bit is set as 1 and the RS field is set as 0 in the A-D
   route, the Protected Root's IP Addr field MUST NOT exist in the A-D
   route.  This means the PE is used as the primary root PE.

   If the R bit in the A-D route is set as 0, the RS field MUST be
   ignored and the Protected Root's IP Addr field MUST NOT exist in the
   A-D route.

5.2.  Advertisement of Role-base State for Leaf Nodes

   The Role-Based Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D route can be used to advertise the
   role and corresponding primary/backup state for leaf nodes in MPLS/
   BGP MVPN.

   If a PE is specified as the leaf PE for a specific MVPN, it MUST set
   the L bit as 1 in the A-D route.  Otherwise, the L bit MUST NOT be
   set.

   If the leaf PE is used as the backup egress node to protect the
   primary leaf PE, the LS field in the A-D route MUST set as 1 when
   there is no determined leaf node to be protected.  In this case the
   primary leaf node protected by the backup leaf node can be calculated
   by all nodes according to some uniform algorithms which is out of the

   scope of this document.  When the LS field in the A-D route is set as
   1, the Protected Leaf's IP Addr field MUST NOT exist in the A-D
   route.

   If the leaf PE is used as the backup egress node to protect the
   primary leaf PE, the LS field in the A-D route MUST set as 2 when
   there is a determined leaf node to be protected.  In this case the
   Protected Leaf's IP Addr field MUST exist in the A-D route which will
   specify the IPv4/IPv6 address of the protected leaf node.

   If the L bit is set as 1 and the LS field is set as 0 in the A-D
   route, the Protected Leaf's IP Addr field MUST NOT exist in the A-D
   route.  This means the PE is used as the primary leaf PE.

   If the L bit in the A-D route is set as 0, the LS field MUST be
   ignored and the Protected Leaf's IP Addr field MUST NOT exist in the
   A-D route.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new type of A-D route for MCAST-VPN NLRI.
   The type is to be assigned by IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security aspects beyond those specified in
   ([RFC6513]) and [RFC6514].
