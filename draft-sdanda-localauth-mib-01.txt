1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410.

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578, STD 58, RFC 2579 and STD 58, RFC 2580.

2.  Introduction

   Authentication, Authorization and Accounting enables the user to
   control the access of the system resources.  Dedicated AAA servers
   cannot be used for small enterprise network deployments that provide
   network access to hundreds of users.  For such scenarios, the user
   information or profiles can be stored locally at the network element.

   This MIB can be used by the central controller to manage Local
   authentication information on the central controller.  One of the
   use-cases would be to monitor user access on multiple vendor devices
   like - user login/logout notifications - user account lifetime expiry
   notifications - User account creation/deletion notifications

Internet-Draft             LOCAL-AUTH-STD-MIB               October 2013


   This draft defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects to monitor Local
   authenticated users.

   Comments should be made directly to the opsawg@ietf.org mailing
   alias.

3.  Terminology

   This document adopts the definitions, acronyms and mechanisms
   described in [RFC2903].  Unless otherwise stated, the mechanisms
   described therein will not be re-described here.

4.  Brief Description of MIB Objects

   This section describes objects pertaining to Local Authenticated
   users with specific information related to the MIB module specified
   in this document.

   The Local Authenticated MIB has one module named LocalAuthMIB which
   is focussed on describing users authenticated locally by Network
   Access Server.

4.1.  Local Auth User Table (localAuthUserTable)

   The localAuthUserTable lists the currently configured local users.
   For each user object, it provides information and statistics about
   the local users.

       DESCRIPTION
           "This MIB module defines objects describing users
           authenticated locally by a Network Access Server (NAS).

               +--------+      +--------+        +---------+
               |        |      |        |        |         |
               | Client |<---->| Server |<------>| Network |
               |        |      |  (NAS) |        |         |
               +--------+      +--------+        +---------+


           A client is a telnet or SSH user needing access to the NAS
           box directly. Network user like PPP or dot1x will request
           NAS box for authentication to access the network.

           NAS box authenticates user present in the local user
           database.

           GLOSSARY

           Network Access Server (NAS)
           A single point of access to a remote resource and is
           exclusively used with Authentication, Authorization
           and Accounting.

           Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
           A data link protocol commonly used in establishing a
           direct connection between two networking nodes.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are few management objects defined in this MIB module with a
   MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects may
   be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
   The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
   proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
   These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability

   Management object localAuthNotifEnable can be modified by the network
   operators which will effect in large number of notification being
   generated by the NAS.

   localAuthUserName object exposed via this MIB may not be considered
   as a risk for an attacker.  Username as an identity in the network
   transport would mostly be a clear test.  If this object is not
   exposed via MIB, intruder can get this infomation via packet capture
   or by any other means.  With knowing username, risk can be mitigated
   by enforcing strong password encryption schemes.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

7.  IANA Considerations

        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        localAuthUserMIB     { mib-2 XXX }


   [Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.]
