Abstract

   The specification of the ALTO protocol uses map based approaches
   assuming that the information provided is static for a longer period
   of time.  The purpose of this memo is to provide a mechanism where
   ALTO clients cache the map information and the servers provide the
   expiration time for invalidation.

Internet-Draft                ALTO Caching                   August 2012


1.  Introduction

   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to
   provide guidance to applications, which have to select one or several
   hosts from a set of candidates, that are able to provide a desired
   resource [RFC5693].  The requirements for ALTO are itemized in
   I-D.ietf-alto-reqs.  ALTO is realized by a client-server
   protocol.ALTO clients send queries to ALTO servers, in order to
   solicit guidance.

   This memo defines a mechanism for ALTO clients to cache the map
   information and for the servers to provide the expiration time for
   invalidation at subset level or map level.


2.  Problem Statement

   The ALTO protocol uses HTTP for discovering available Information
   resources at an ALTO server and retrieving information resources.
   The protocol defines Map-based and Non-map based approaches for
   retrieving information resources.Map-based approaches are chosen as
   they lower the signaling load on the server, as the maps have only to
   be retrieved if they are changed.

   HTTP protocol already defines mechanisms for caching the content.
   There are many limitations in using those mechanisms.  HTTP based
   caches store the responses only for HTTP GET requests.  ALTO queries
   can be GET or POST(in case of filtered map) requests.  In the case of
   POST requests, HTTP caching mechanism cannot be used because
   responses for POST are generally not cached.

   The validity of the information in the map need not be same for all
   the elements in the map and there is currently no mechanism(in HTTP
   also) to convey this information.  This mechanism has to be
   incorporated into the protocol itself.


3.  Protocol Structure

   The ALTO Protocol uses a simple extensible framework to convey
   network information.  In the general framework, the ALTO protocol
   will convey properties on both Network Locations and the paths
   between Network Locations.[I-D.ietf-alto-protocol].

   The Map filtering and endpoint property services can be extended to
   include the map level and subset level expiration time.

4.  Overall Operation

   The overall operation is based on the ALTO client caching the map
   information.  The ALTO server sends the map information providing
   details of full or subset level expiration.

   ALTO server can choose to use HTTP based caching mechanisms or ALTO
   caching mechanism (defined in this document) based on the request.

   A typical message flow would be:

                 ALTO Client       ALTO Server
                     |-----ALTO Query--->|     ALTO Query for complete map information
                     |<---ALTO Response--|     ALTO Response with caching related information
                     |                   |
Subset level         |------ALTO Query-->|     ALTO Query for expired maps
validity expires     |<-------200--------|     ALTO response
                     |                      |

5.  Definitions

   ALTO cache: Any logical entity which caches the ALTO responses for
   the purpose of reducing repeated requests by the alto client to the
   alto server.  The ALTO cache MAY be co-located with the ALTO client
   or it can be a separate node


6.  ALTO Types

   This section details the format for particular data values used for
   ALTO caching framework.  Base types defined by I-D.ietf-alto-protocol
   are used by this memo with some extensions listed below.

6.1.  EndpointAddrGroup

   EndpointAddrGroup JSON object is extended as below

   object {
        JSONString expires;
        EndpointPrefix [AddressType]<0..*>;
        ...
      } EndpointAddrGroup;

6.2.  NetworkMapData

   NetworkMapData JSON object is extended as below

    object {
        JSONString expires;
        EndpointAddrGroup [pidname]<0..*>;
        ...
      } NetworkMapData;


7.  ALTO caching and Consistency

   ALTO servers specify the expiration time of the complete map or the
   subset level maps in the response.  Expiration time format is an
   absolute date and time with GMT as reference.  ISPs MAY use any
   mechanism to determine the expiration time.  This is out of the scope
   of this specification.

7.1.  Server behavior

   ALTO server MAY use HTTP based or ALTO caching mechanism to convey
   the expiration time.  When the request is HTTP GET,then the ALTO
   server MAY use HTTP based caching mechanism.  In the case of request

Internet-Draft                ALTO Caching                   August 2012


   being POST, ALTO server SHOULD use ALTO caching mechanism.  To ensure
   consistent behaviour and reduce implementation complexity it is
   recommended that the mechanism defined by this memo is used for all
   caching scenarios.

7.2.  Client behavior

   ALTO cache MUST be able to identify expiration of map level or subset
   level information.  On expiry, cache SHOULD trigger a new request to
   the server to refresh the expiration.

7.3.  Cache Consistency Approaches

   ALTO caches are useful when cache consistency is maintained,that is,
   cached copies should be updated when the originals change.There are
   two different types of consistency approaches - weak consistency and
   strong consistency.  Weak consistency is an approach in which stale
   documents may be returned to user , while the latter approach ensures
   that stale documents are never returned to user.

   ALTO caches SHOULD have strong invalidation mechanisms.  In the case
   of P2P, the stale data can result in the unoptimized peer selection
   and resulting in selecting the longest PATH which will defeat the
   purpose of ALTO.  In the case of cdni(see [I-D.seedorf-i2aex-alto-
   cdni-perpective] for details)) there can be service failures as
   requests are redirected to wrong/invalid dCDN.

   The below table shows comparison of different validation approaches.
   Assume that interleave of requests and file modifications happens in
   the order RRRMMMRRMRRRMMRM.Let R be the number of times a node views
   a resource and RI be the number of intervals during which client
   repeatedly asks for resource while resource is changed.  It is
   evident that notification based mechanisms takes few control messages
   and ensures that there is no stale data returned.

   The mechanism of notification is proposed in
   [draft-madhavan-alto-subscription]
