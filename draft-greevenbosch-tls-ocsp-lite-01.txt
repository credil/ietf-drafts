               OCSP-lite - Revocation of raw public keys
                  draft-greevenbosch-tls-ocsp-lite-01

Abstract

   This document provides an online mechanism for checking the
   revocation status of raw public keys.  The mechanism is based on its
   older brother for X.509 certificates, OCSP.

Note

   Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should
   be sent to tls@ietf.org.

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   In [I-D.ietf-tls-oob-pubkey], a format to store and convey a raw
   public key has been defined.  This format is designed as a
   lightweight alternative to X.509 certificates.

   An important feature of a public key infrastructure (PKI) is the
   possibility to revoke certificates.  This is important to keep the
   environment safe, even when some of the public keys have been
   compromised.

   For X.509 certificates, there are two ways to revoke public keys:
   through Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs, see e.g. [X.509] or
   [RFC5280]), or through an OCSP responder [RFC2560].  The former is a
   list that contains identifiers for revoked certificates, and is
   distributed to the clients that need to check revocation status.  The

Internet-Draft                  OCSP-lite                      June 2013


   latter is an online service, to which the client can send requests to
   verify the revocation status of a particular X.509 certificate.  OCSP
   has the advantage above CRLs that it can provide more timely
   information, and does not need to provide more information than is
   required by the client.

   This draft proposes a similar mechanism to the X.509 OCSP responder
   for raw public keys.  It is based on X.509 OCSP, but aims at
   remaining as lightweight as possible, especially to cater those
   constrained devices that rely on raw public keys because of their
   low-complexity.

3.  Terminology

   o  RPK: raw public key as defined in [I-D.ietf-tls-oob-pubkey].

   o  Requester: the entity that wants to verify the validity of a RPK.

   o  Responder: the entity that provides information about the
      revocation/authentication status of a RPK to the requester.

4.  Requirements

   This section lists requirements for authentication and revocation
   checking of raw public keys (RPK):

   1.  It SHALL be possible for a receiver of an RPK to determine
       whether that RPK has been revoked.

   2.  It SHALL be possible to verify the binding between the RPK and
       the entity associated with it.

   3.  The revocation checking mechanism SHALL NOT require much
       complexity on the requester's side.

   4.  The revocation checking mechanism SHALL be scalable, allowing
       potentially millions of requesters to verify RPKs.

   5.  The revocation checking mechanism MAY use a hierarchical ordering
       of RPKs, to delegate revocation checks.

   6.  The RPK MAY be accompanied with an identifier that indicates the
       issuer of the RPK and/or associated certificate chain.

5.  Possible hierarchical architecture

   Figure 1 shows an example architecture, where the OCSP-lite
   responders use more thorough checking through regular OCSP
   responders.

   The OCSP-lite responders obtain the complete certificate chain
   related to the RPK.  The OCSP-lite responders verify the certificate
   chains, with requests to regular OCSP responders or lookups in CRLs
   where appropriate.

   Hints where the certificate chain can be found may be included by the
   requesters.  The OCSP-lite responder could cache the certificate
   chains and the regular OCSP responses.

   [Kessler2000] evaluates and discusses a similar certificate
   revocation framework.

6.  Pre-conditions

   The following pre-conditions are assumed:

   o  The requester knows which responder is associated with the public
      key it wants to verify.

   o  The requester knows the public key of the responder.

   o  The requester knows the identifier of the responder, or can
      calculate it from the responder's public key.

7.  Request

   The request has the following syntax:

      OCSPliteRequest     ::=     SEQUENCE {
          request             Request,
          optionalSignature   EXPLICIT Signature OPTIONAL
      }

      Request             ::=     SEQUENCE {
          version             Version DEFAULT v1,
          nonce               BIT STRING,
          requesterID         BIT STRING OPTIONAL,
          publicKeyID         BIT STRING,
          requestExtensions   EXPLICIT Extensions OPTIONAL
      }

      Signature       ::=     SEQUENCE {
          signatureAlgorithm      AlgorithmIdentifier,
          signature               BIT STRING,
          publicKey               BIT STRING OPTIONAL
      }

      Version         ::=     INTEGER  {  v1(0) }


   The fields have the following meaning:

   optionalSignature:  The signature by the requester over the "request"
      field.  This signature MAY be mandated depending on trust policy.

   request:  The actual request.  Only the status of one public key can
      be requested at a time.

Internet-Draft                  OCSP-lite                      June 2013


   version:  The version of the protocol.  The value MUST be 0,
      indicating this version 1.

   nonce:  An integer chosen by the requester to ensure the response is
      fresh.

   requesterID:  The identifier for the client's public key.  This is
      the hash over the client's public key.  (Algorithm TBD)

   publicKeyID:  The identifier for the public key of which the
      revocation status is requested.  Calculated similarly as
      "requesterID".

   requestExtensions:  Extensions for future use.

   signatureAlgorithm:  The algorithm used for the signature.  The
      algorithm identifiers are Object Identifiers (OIDs).

   signature:  The signature data.

   publicKey:  The public key of the requester.  This field MAY NOT be
      needed depending on whether the responder has other means to
      acquire the public key.  If included, the responder MUST verify
      that the publicKey matches with the requesterID.

8.  Request handling

   If the responder receives a request, it MUST perform the following
   checks:

   o  Verify the version of the protocol.

   o  Verify the supported algorithms.

   o  Verify that the requester is eligible to perform the request.

   o  If the signature is included, verify the requester's public key
      and ID binding.

   o  If the signature is included, verify the signature.

   o  Verify the requester's own revocation status.

   If any of these checks fail, the responder MUST discard the message.
   TBD: Error feedback useful, or is ignoring the message enough?

   After these verifications, the responder verifies the status of the
   requested public key.  The following statusses have been defined:

Internet-Draft                  OCSP-lite                      June 2013


   GOOD:  The public is known and has not been revoked.

   REVOKED:  The public key has been revoked and MUST NOT be used.

   EXPIRED:  The public key's lifetime has expired.

   UNKNOWN:  The public key is unknown to the responder.

9.  Response

   The OCSP-lite response has the following syntax:

      OCSPliteResponse       ::= SEQUENCE
      {
         response             Response,
         signature            EXPLICIT Signature
      }

      Response ::= SEQUENCE {
         version              EXPLICIT Version DEFAULT v1,
         nonce                BIT STRING,
         responderID          BIT STRING OPTIONAL,
         publicKeyID          BIT STRING,
         publicKeyStatus      PubKeyStatus,
         responseExtensions   EXPLICIT Extensions OPTIONAL
      }

      PubKeyStatus :== ENUMERATED {
          good        (0),
          revoked     (1),
          expired     (2),
          unknown     (3)
      }


   The fields have the following meanings:

   signature:  The signature by the responder over the "response" field.
      For the format, see section Section 7.

   response:  The actual response.

   version:  The version of the protocol.  The value MUST be 0,
      indicating this version 1.

   nonce:  This field MUST carry the same value as "nonce" in the
      request.

Internet-Draft                  OCSP-lite                      June 2013


   responderID:  The identifier for the responder.  This is the hash
      over the responder's public key.  (Algorithm TBD)

   publicKeyID:  The identifier for the public key of which the
      revocation status is provided.  Calculated similarly as
      "responderID".

   publicKeyStatus:  The requested public key status, as defined in
      section Section 8.

   responseExtensions:  Extensions for future use.

10.  Response handling

   Upon receipt of the response, the requester MUST verify the
   following:

   o  The responder's ID.

   o  The signature is valid.

   o  The nonce in the response matches the nonce in the request.

   o  The public key ID in the response matches the public key ID from
      the request.

   If any of these checks fails, the client MUST discard the response as
   it is invalid.  The client SHALL NOT consider the public key valid,
   without receipt of a valid response.  The requester MAY resend the
   request to try to acquire a valid response.

   The following rules hold upon receiving a valid response:

   o  The requester MUST assume the public key is valid upon receiving a
      response with status code "GOOD".

   o  The requester SHALL NOT trust a public key which has been revoked
      or expired.

   o  Depending on the application, the requester MAY trust a public key
      upon receiving a valid response with status code "UNKNOWN".

   The requester SHALL NOT trust a public key for which it has sent a
   request but not received a response.  The requester MAY resend the
   request.

   o  Avoid ASN.1 (and BER) and define a lightweight binary format?

   o  Reserve Object Identifiers where necessary.

   o  If applicable, clean up pseudo-ASN syntax to valid ASN syntax.

   o  Reduce complexity by removal of extensibility mechanism?

   o  If extensibility mechanism is maintained, define how to handle
      extensions.

   o  Change name to something more distinct from "The Lightweight
      Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Profile for High-Volume
      Environments" [RFC5019].

   o  An identifier for the issuer of the RPK may be useful.  This may
      be included in the ID of the RPK, which would then consist of more
      (or something other) than just the hash of the RPK.

   o  To cater for a single compromised OCSP-lite responder, the trust
      model may require a requester to consult multiple OCSP-lite
      responders, refusing the RPK if at least one of the responders
      does not return "good".

12.  Security Considerations

   This section is very important, and needs input from several security
   experts.

   Cover at least:

   o  Safe keeping of responder's private key

   o  Complications of revoking the responder's own public key

   o  Requirement (or not) of signed requests

   o  Possibility of outdated data

   o  Undiscovered compromise of public keys

   o  Issues with delegating regular OCSP/CRL checks to an OCSP-lite
      responder

13.  IANA considerations

   Until now, no IANA requests are required for this document.
