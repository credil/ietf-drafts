               Diameter Congestion and Filter Attributes
           draft-bertz-dime-congestion-flow-attributes-01.txt

Abstract

   This document defines optional ECN and filter related attributes that
   can be used for improved traffic identification, support of ECN and
   minimized filter administration within Diameter.

   RFC 5777 defines a Filter-Rule AVP that accommodates extensions for
   classification, conditions and actions. It does not support traffic
   identification for packets using Explicit Congestion Notification as
   defined in RFC 3168 and does not provide specific actions when the
   flow(s) described by the Filter-Rule are congested.

   A Filter-Rule can describe multiple flows but not the exact number of
   flows. Flow count and other associated data (e.g. packets) is not
   captured in Accounting applications, leaving administrators without
   useful information regarding the effectiveness or understanding of
   the filter definition.

   These optional attributes are forward and backwards compatible with
   RFC 5777.

Internet-Draft      Congestion and Filter Attributes       November 2012


1.  Introduction

   Two optional Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [RFC3168] related
   AVPs are specified in the document.  The first AVP provides direct
   support for ECN [RFC3168] in the IP header and the second AVP
   provides the ability to define alternate traffic treatment when
   congestion is experienced.

   This document also defines two optional AVPs, Flow-Count and Packet-
   Count, used for conveying flow information within the Diameter
   protocol [RFC6733].  These AVPs were found to be useful for a wide
   range of applications.  The AVPs provide a way to convey information
   of the group of flows described by the Filter-Rule, IPFilterRule or
   other Diameter traffic filters.

   The semantics and encoding of all AVPs can be found in Section 3.

   Such AVPs are, for example, needed by some ECN applications to
   determine the number of flows congested or used by administrators to
   determine the impact of filter definitions.

   Additional parameters may be defined in future documents as the need
   arises.  All parameters are defined as Diameter-encoded Attribute
   Value Pairs (AVPs), which are described using a modified version of
   the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF), see [RFC6733].  The data types
   are also taken from [RFC6733].

2.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

3.  ECN-IP-Codepoint, Congestion-Treatment and Filter Attributes

3.1.  ECN-IP-Codepoint AVP

   The ECN-IP-Codepoint AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Enumerated and
   specifies the Explicit Congestion Notification codepoint values to
   match in the IP header.

   Value | Binary | Keyword                            | References
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
   0     | 00     | Non-ECT (Not ECN-Capable Transport)| [RFC3168]
   1     | 01     | ECT(1) (ECN-Capable Transport)     | [RFC3168]
   2     | 10     | ECT(0) (ECN-Capable Transport)     | [RFC3168]
   3     | 11     | CE (Congestion Experienced)        | [RFC3168]

   When this AVP is used for classification in the Filter-Rule it MUST
   be part of Classifier Grouped AVP as defined in RFC5777.

3.2.  Congestion-Treatment AVP

   The Congestion-Treatment AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Grouped and
   indicates how congested traffic, i.e., traffic that has Explicit
   Congestion Notification Congestion Experienced marking set or some
   other administratively defined criteria, is treated.  In case the
   Congestion-Treatment AVP is absent the treatment of the congested
   traffic is left to the discretion of the node performing QoS
   treatment.

   	     Congestion-Treatment ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
                           { Treatment-Action }
                           [ QoS-Profile-Template ]
                           [ QoS-Parameters ]
                         * [ AVP ]

   Treatment-Action, QoS-Profile-Template and QoS-Parameters are defined
   in [RFC5777].  The Congestion-Treatment AVP is an action and MUST be
   an attribute of the Filter-Rule Grouped AVP as defined in RFC5777.

3.3.  Flow-Count AVP

   The Flow-Count AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned64.

   It indicates the number of protocol specific flows.  The protocol is
   determined by the filter (e.g. IPFilterRule, Filter-Id, etc.).

3.4.  Packet-Count AVP

   The Packet-Count AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned64.

   It indicates the number of protocol specific packets.  The protocol
   is determined by the filter (e.g. IPFilterRule, Filter-Id, etc.).  

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  AVP Codes

   IANA allocated AVP codes in the IANA-controlled namespace registry
   specified in Section 11.1.1 of [RFC6733] for the following AVPs that
   are defined in this document.

5.  Security Considerations

   The document does not raise any new security concerns.  This document
   describes an extension of RFC5777 that introduces a new filter
   parameter applied to ECN as defined by [RFC3168].  It also defines a
   new Grouped AVP that expresses what action to take should congestion
   be detected.  The Grouped AVP reuses attributes defined in RFC5777.

   The security considerations of the Diameter protocol itself have been
   discussed in RFC 6733 [RFC6733].  Use of the AVPs defined in this
   document MUST take into consideration the security issues and
   requirements of the Diameter base protocol.
