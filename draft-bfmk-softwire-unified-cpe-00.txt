Abstract

   Transporting IPv4 packets over IPv6 is a common solution to the
   problem of IPv4 service continuity over IPv6-only provider networks.
   A number of differing functional approaches have been developed for
   this, each having their own specific characteristics.  As these
   approaches share a similar functional architecture and use the same
   data plane mechanisms, this memo describes a specification whereby a
   single CPE can interwork with all of the standardized and proposed
   approaches to providing encapsulated IPv4 in IPv6 services.

Internet-Draft      Generic CPE Provisioning Profile       November 2012


1.  Introduction

   IPv4 service continuity is one of the major technical challenges
   which must be considered during IPv6 migration.  Over the past few
   years, a number of different approaches have been developed to assist
   with this problem.  These approaches, or modes, exist in order to
   meet the particular deployment, scaling, addressing and other
   requirements of different service provider's networks.  Section 3
   describes these approaches in more detail.

   A common feature shared between all of the differing modes is the
   integration of softwire tunnel end-point functionality into the CPE
   router.  Due to this inherent data plane similarity, a single CPE may
   be capable of supporting several different approaches.  Users may
   also wish to configure a specific mode of operation.

   A service provider's network may also have more than one mode
   enabled.  Reasons for this include supporting diverse CPE clients,
   simplifying migration between modes or where service requirements
   define specific supporting softwire architectures.

   In order for softwire based services to be successfully established,
   it is essential that the customer end-node, the service provider end-
   node and provisioning systems are able to indicate their capabilities
   and preferred mode of operation.

   This memo describes the logic required by both the CPE tunnel end-
   node and the service provider's provisioning infrastructure so that
   softwire services can be provided in mixed-mode environments.

1.1.  Rationale

   The following rationale has been adopted for this document:

   (1)  Describe clear distinctions between the different solution modes
   (2)  Simplify solution migration paths: Define a unified CPE behavior
        which allows for smooth migration between the different modes
   (3)  Deterministic co-existence behavior: Specify the behavior when
        several modes co-exist in the CPE
   (4)  Re-usability: Maximize the re-use of existing functional blocks
        including Tunnel Endpoint, port restricted NAPT44, Forwarding
        behavior, etc.
   (5)  Solution agnostic: Adopt neutral terminology and avoid (as far
        as possible) overloading the document with solution-specific
        terms

Internet-Draft      Generic CPE Provisioning Profile       November 2012


   (6)  Flexibility: Allow operators to compile CPE software only for
        the mode(s) necessary for their chosen deployment context(s)
   (7)  Simplicity: Provide a model that allows operators to only
        implement the specific mode(s) that they require without the
        additional complexity of unneeded modes.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  IPv4 Service Continuity Architectures: A 'Big Picture' Overview

   The solutions which have been proposed within the Softwire WG can be
   categorized into three main functional approaches, as listed below:
   (1)  Full stateful approach (DS-Lite, [RFC6333]): Requires per-
        session state to be maintained in the Service Provider's
        network.
   (2)  Binding approach (e.g., Lightweight 4over6 (Lw4o6)
        [I-D.cui-softwire-b4-translated-ds-lite],
        [I-D.ietf-softwire-public-4over6] or MAP 1:1
        [I-D.ietf-softwire-map] ): Requires a single per-subscriber
        state (or a few) to be maintained in the Service Provider's
        network.
   (3)  Full stateless approach (MAP, [I-D.ietf-softwire-map]): Does not
        require per-session or per-subscriber state to be maintained in
        the Service Provider's network.

   All these approaches share a similar architecture, using a tunnel
   end-node located in a CPE and a tunnel concentrator end-node located
   in the service provider's network.  All use IPv6 as the transport
   protocol for the delivery of an IPv4 connectivity service using an
   IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation scheme [RFC2473].

   Throughout this document, the different techniques that have been
   proposed to realize these different functional approaches (DS-Lite,
   Lw4o6, & MAP-E) are referred to as 'modes'.

4.  Unified Softwire CPE Behaviour

   This section specifies a unified CPE behavior capable of supporting
   the three modes

4.1.  Full IPv4 Address Assignment

   All the aforementioned modes MUST be designed to allow either a full
   or a shared IPv4 address to be assigned to a customer end-node.

   DS-Lite and MAP-E fulfill this requirement.  With minor changes, the
   [I-D.cui-softwire-b4-translated-ds-lite] specification can be updated
   to assign full IPv4 addresses.

4.2.  Customer Side NAT

   A NAT function within the customer end-node is not required for DS-
   Lite, while it is optional for both MAP-E and Lw4o6.

Internet-Draft      Generic CPE Provisioning Profile       November 2012


   When enabled in MAP-E and Lw4o6, the NAT MUST be able to restrict its
   external translated source ports to within the set of ports
   provisioned to the Initiator (e.g., Host, CPE).

4.3.  Generic CPE Bootstrapping Logic

   The generic provisioning logic is designed to meet the following
   requirements:
   o  When several service continuity modes are supported by the same
      CPE, it MUST be possible to configure a single mode for use.
   o  For a given network attachment, only one mode MUST be activated.
   o  The CPE MAY be configured by a user or via remote device
      management means (e.g., DHCP, TR-069).
   o  A network which supports one or several modes MUST return valid
      configuration data allowing requesting devices to unambiguously
      select a single mode to use for attachment.

   This section sketches a generic algorithm to be followed by a CPE
   supporting one or all the modes listed above.  Based on the retrieved
   information, the CPE will determine which mode to activate.

   (1)  If a given mode is enabled (DS-Lite, Lw4o6 or MAP-E), the CPE
        MUST be configured with the required provisioning information
        listed in Table 4.  If all of the required information is not
        available locally, the CPE MUST use available provisioning means
        (e.g., DHCP) to retrieve the missing configuration data.
   (2)  If the CPE supports several modes, but no mode is explicitly
        enabled, the CPE MUST use available provisioning means (e.g.,
        DHCP) to retrieve available configuration parameters and use the
        availability of individual parameters to ascertain which
        functional mode to configure:
        (2.1)  If only a Remote IPv4-in-IPv6 Tunnel Endpoint is
               received, the CPE MUST proceed as follows:
               (2.1.1)  IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel endpoint initialization is
                        defined in [RFC6333].
               (2.1.2)  Outbound IPv4 packets are forwarded to the next
                        hop as specified in Section 4.5.

        (2.2)  If a Remote IPv4-in-IPv6 Tunnel Endpoint, an IPv4 Address
               and optionally a Port Set are received, the CPE MUST
               behave as follows:
               (2.2.1)  IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel endpoint initialization is
                        similar to B4 [RFC6333].
               (2.2.2)  When NAPT44 is required (e.g., because the CPE
                        is a router), a NAPT44 module is enabled.

Internet-Draft      Generic CPE Provisioning Profile       November 2012


               (2.2.3)  The tunnel endpoint is assigned with a native
                        IPv6 address.  No particular considerations are
                        required to be taken into account to generate
                        the Interface Identifier.
               (2.2.4)  When a port set is provisioned, the external
                        source ports MUST be restricted to the
                        provisioned set of ports.
               (2.2.5)  Outbound (NATed) IPv4 packets are forwarded to
                        the next hop as specified in Section 4.5.

        (2.3)  If Mapping Rule(s) are received, the CPE MUST behave as
               follows:
               (2.3.1)  IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel endpoint initialization is
                        similar to a B4 [RFC6333].
               (2.3.2)  The tunnel endpoint is assigned with an IPv6
                        address which includes an IPv4 address.  The MAP
                        Interface Identifier is based on the format
                        specified in Section 2.2 of [RFC6052].
               (2.3.3)  When NAPT44 is required (e.g., because the CPE
                        is a router), a NAPT44 module is enabled.
               (2.3.4)  When a port set is provisioned, the external
                        source port MUST be restricted to the
                        provisioned set of ports.
               (2.3.5)  Outbound (NATed) IPv4 packets are forwarded to
                        the next hop as specified in Section 4.5.

4.4.  Customer Side DHCP Based Provisioning

      [DISCUSSION NOTE: As it is proposed that OPTION_MAP would be used
      for all new softwire provisioning, should we rename OPTION_MAP to
      OPTION_SW (incl. the associated sub-options)?]

   DHCP-based configuration SHOULD be implemented by the customer end-
   node using the following two DHCP options:

   OPTION_AFTR_NAME    [RFC6334] Provides the FQDN for the remote IPv4-
                       in-IPv6 tunnel end-point.
   OPTION_MAP          [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-dhcp] Provides IPv4-
                       related configuration for the binding mode,
                       mapping rules for the stateless mode, including
                       MAP parameters (e.g., offset, domain prefix,
                       etc).  OPTION_MAP_BIND is a sub-option used to
                       convey an IPv4 address (for example, encoded as
                       an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address [RFC4291]).  This
                       address is used when binding mode is enabled.
                       The receipt of OPTION_MAP_BIND is an implicit
                       indication to the customer side device to operate
                       in binding, rather than stateless mode.

   The customer end-node uses the DHCP Option Request Option (ORO) to
   request either one or both of these options depending on which modes
   it is capable of and configured to support.

   The DHCP options sent in the response allow the service provider to
   inform the customer end-node which operating mode to enable.

   The following table shows the different DHCP options (and sub-
   options) that the service provider can supply in a response.

   +-----------------------+-------------+-------------+---------------+
   |           DHCP Option | Stateful    | Binding     | Stateless     |
   |                       | Mode        | Mode        | Mode          |
   +-----------------------+-------------+-------------+---------------+
   |      OPTION_AFTR_NAME | Yes         | Yes         | Optional      |
   |            OPTION_MAP | No          | Yes         | No            |
   |       OPTION_MAP_BIND |             |             |               |
   |            OPTION_MAP | No          | No          | Yes           |
   |       OPTION_MAP_RULE |             |             |               |
   | OPTION_MAP_PORTPARAMS | No          | Optional    | Optional      |
   +-----------------------+-------------+-------------+---------------+

                 Table 5: DHCP Option Provisioning Matrix

   The customer side device MUST interpret the received DHCP
   configuration parameters according to the logic defined in
   Section 4.3:

   o  If only OPTION_AFTR_NAME is received, then the device MUST operate
      in stateful mode
   o  If both OPTION_AFTR_NAME and OPTION_MAP_BIND are received then the
      device MUST operate in binding mode
   o  If one or more OPTION_MAP_RULE options are received, then the
      customer side device MUST operate in stateless mode
   o  If both OPTION_AFTR_NAME and OPTION_MAP_RULE(s) are received, then
      the customer side device MUST operate as a MAP CE.
      OPTION_AFTR_NAME provides the FQDN of the MAP BR.
   o  If OPTION_MAP_PORTPARAMS is received as a sub-option to either
      OPTION_MAP_BIND or OPTION_MAP_RULE, then NAPT44 MUST be configured
      using the supplied port-set for external translated source ports.

   From the service providers side, the following rule MUST be followed:

   o  The DHCP server MUST NOT send both OPTION_MAP_BIND and
      OPTION_MAP_RULE in a single OPTION_MAP response.

4.5.  Forwarding Action by the Customer End-Node

   For all modes, the longest prefix match algorithm MUST be enforced to
   forward outbound IPv4 packets.

   Concretely, this algorithm will:
   o  always return the address of the AFTR for the DS-Lite mode.
   o  always return the address of the lwAFTR for the binding mode.
   o  return the next hop according to the pre-configured mapping rules
      for the stateless mode (i.e., MAP-E).


5.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations discussed in Section 7 of
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-stateless-4v6-motivation] and Section 11 of
   [RFC6333]should be taken into account.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any action from IANA.
