INTERNET-DRAFT                                      PWE3 TRILL Transport


1. Introduction

   The IETF has standardized the TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of
   Lots of Links) protocol [RFC6325] that provides optimal pair-wise
   data frame routing without configuration in multi-hop networks with
   arbitrary topology. TRILL supports multipathing of both unicast and
   multicast traffic. Devices that implement TRILL are called TRILL
   Switches or RBridges (Routing Bridges).

   Links between TRILL Switches can be based on arbitrary link
   protocols, for example PPP [RFC6361], as well as Ethernet [RFC6325].
   A set of connected TRILL Switches together form a TRILL campus which
   is bounded by end stations and layer 3 routers.

   This document specifies how to interconnect a pair of TRILL Switch
   ports using a pseudowire under existing TRILL and PWE3 (Pseudowire
   Emulation End-to-End) standards.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                      PWE3 TRILL Transport


2. PWE3 Interconnection of TRILL Switches

   When a pseudowire is used to interconnect a pair of TRILL Switch
   ports, a PPP [RFC4618] pseudowire is used as described below. The
   pseudowire between such ports can be auto-configured [RFC4447] or
   manually configured. In this context, the TRILL Switch ports at the
   ends of the pseudowire are acting as native service processing
   elements (NSP [RFC3985]) and, assuming the pseudowires are over MPLS
   or IP [RFC4023] networks, as label switched or IP routers at the
   TRILL Switch ports.

   Pseudowires provide transparent transport and the two TRILL Switch
   ports appear directly interconnected with a transparent link.  With
   such an interconnection the TRILL adjacency over the link is
   automatically discovered and established through TRILL IS-IS control
   messages [RFC6327bis].

   A pseudowire is carried over a packet switched network tunnel
   [RFC3985].  For example, an MPLS or MPLS-TP label switched path
   tunnel in MPLS networks. Either a signaling protocol or manual
   configuration can be used to configure a label switched path tunnel
   between two TRILL Switch ports. This application needs no additions
   to the existing pseudowire standards.



2.1 PWE3 Type Independent Details

   The sending pseudowire TRILL Switch port MUST copy the priority of
   the TRILL Data packets being sent to the 3-bit Traffic Class field of
   the pseudowire label [RFC5462] so the priority will be visible to
   pseudowire transit devices and they can take the priority into
   account. TRILL IS-IS PDUs critical to establishing and maintaining
   adjacency (Hello and MTU PDUs) SHOULD be send with Traffic Class 7
   while other TRILL IS-IS PDUs SHOULD be sent with Traffic Class 6.

   If a pseudowire supports fragmentation and re-assembly, there is no
   reason to do TRILL MTU testing on it and the pseudowire will not be a
   constraint on the TRILL campus wide Sz (see Section 4.3.1 [RFC6325]).
   If the pseudowire does not support fragmentation, then the available
   TRILL IS-IS packet payload size over the pseudowire (taking into
   account MPLS encapsulation with a control word) or some lower value,
   MUST be used in helping to determine Sz (see Section 5
   [ClearCorrect]).

   An intervening MPLS label switched router or similar packet switched
   network device has no awareness of TRILL. Such devices will not
   change the TRILL Header hop count.

2.2 PPP PWE3 Transport of TRILL

   For a PPP pseudowire (PW type = 0x0007), the two TRILL Switch ports
   being connected are configured to form a pseudowire with PPP
   encapsulation [RFC4618]. After the pseudowire is established and
   TRILL use is negotiated within PPP, the two TRILL Switch ports appear
   directly connected with a PPP link [RFC1661] [RFC6361].

   If pseudowire interconnection of two TRILL Switch ports is auto-
   configured [RFC4447], the initiating TRILL Switch port MUST attempt
   the connection set-up with pseudowire type PPP (0x0007).

   Behavior for TRILL with a PPP pseudowire continues to follow that of
   TRILL over PPP as specified in Section 3 of [RFC6361].

   The following figures show what a TRILL Data and TRILL IS-IS packet
   look like over such a pseudowire in the MPLS case assuming no TRILL
   Header extensions:

      |   Server MPLS Tunnel Label(s) |  n*4 octets (4 octets per label)

3. IANA Considerations

   No IANA actions are required by this document. RFC Editor: Please
   remove this section before publication.




4. Security Considerations

   For PPP link TRILL security considerations, see [RFC6361].

   For security considerations introduced by carrying PPP TRILL links
   over pseudowires, see [RFC3985], which discusses the risks introduced
   by sending protocols that previously assumed a point-to-point link on
   a pseudo wire built on a packet switched network (PSN).

   As in [RFC6361], not all implementations need to include specific
   security mechanisms at the pseudowire layer, for example if they are
   designed to be deployed only in cases where the networking
   environment is trusted or where other layers provide adequate
   security.  A complete enumeration of possible deployment scenarios
   and associated threats and options is not possible and is outside the
   scope of this document.  For applications involving sensitive data,
   end-to-end security should always be considered, in addition to link
   security, to provide security in depth.

   In this context, such end-to-end security should be between the end
   stations involved so as to protect the entire path to, through, and
   from the TRILL campus.

   For general TRILL protocol security considerations, see [RFC6325].

Appendix A: Use of Other Pseudowire Types

   This informational Appendix briefly discusses use of pseudowire types
   other than PPP for the transport of TRILL.

   The use of Ethernet pseudowires [RFC4448] was examined by the authors
   and would be possible; however, they would require an additional 12
   or 16 bytes per packet as shown in the following figures for a TRILL
   Data and TRILL IS-IS packet over such an Ethernet pseudowire in the
   MPLS case assuming no TRILL Header extensions (compare with Figures 1
   and 2):

      +-------------------------------+
      |   Server MPLS Tunnel Label(s) |  n*4 octets (4 octets per label)
      +-------------------------------+
      |          PW Label             |  4 octets
      +-------------------------------+
      |    Optional Control Word      |  4 octets
      +-------------------------------+
      |  TRILL Hop Dest. MAC Address  |  6 octets
      +-------------------------------+
      |  TRILL Hop Source MAC Address |  6 octets
      +-------------------------------+

      +-------------------------------+
      |    Destination MAC Address    |  6 octets

      |      Source MAC Address       |  6 octets
      +-------------------------------+
      |          Data Label           |  4 or 8 octets
      +-------------------------------+
      |         Payload Body          |  variable

   It would also be possible to specify a new pseudowire type for TRILL
   traffic but the authors feel that any efficiency gain over PPP
   pseudowires would be too small to be worth the complexity of adding
   such a specification. Furthermore using PPP pseudowire encoding means
   that any traffic dissector that understands TRILL PPP encoding
   [RFC6361] and understands PPP pseudowires [RFC4618] will
   automatically be able to recursively decode TRILL transported by
   pseudowire.
