1.  Introduction

   In PAWS protocol, the master device queries the database for
   available spectrum, but the device MUST determine the URI for the
   database before it can send any PAWS messages.

   The URI of database can be pre-configured manually in the device
   before it sends any PAWS messages, for example, the owner of the
   device can configure the URI when he/she wants to use the master
   device in certain area.  This method needs the owner of the device to
   know the available database that can be used in the regulatory
   domain.

   The URI of database can also be obtained by a dynamic discovery
   process, and this is where this document focuses.  Before the device
   sends any PAWS messages to the database, it first starts a Database
   Discovery Procedure to retrieve the available database(s) and
   applicable regulatory domain information.  This document provides an
   optional method for the master device to find an available WSDB.

   In discovery procedure, the URI for the database SHOULD be obtained
   from an authorized and authenticated entity.  The master device
   provides its current geo-location information to the entity in
   Database Discovery Request message, and the entity will return a list
   of available databases and the regulatory body that has jurisdiction
   over the master device's location.

   When the master device gets the information about available database
   and regulatory body, it can choose the proper database for querying
   white space spectrum by PAWS procedures.

   The database discovery mechanism is based on LoST protocol RFC5222
   [RFC5222].


2.  Terminology and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

   The terminology from PAWS: problem statement, use cases and
   requirements PAWS RQMTS [PAWS RQMTS] is applicable to this document.

   White Space Database (WSDB)

   In the context of white space and cognitive radio technologies, the
   database is an entity which contains, but is not limited to, current

   information as required by the regulatory policies about available
   spectrum at any given location and time, and other types of related
   (to the white space spectrum) or relevant information.

   White Space Database Discovery Server (WSDB DS)

   A server function provided to a white space device, the client.  The
   white space device contacts a white space database discovery server
   to receive the service of discovering or identifying one or more
   white space databases.  The white space database discovery server is
   a known entity to the white space device, which knows at least a
   useable internet address for the white space database discovery
   server.  The white space database discovery server takes as input
   positioning information from the white space device and returns both
   address information which allows the white space device to contact a
   trusted, regulatory-authorized white space database, suitable for
   service at the white space device's current location and indication
   of the regulatory domain governing at the white space device's
   current location.  A single white space database discovery server may
   have global scope, serving clients located globally.

   Service boundary

   A service boundary circumscribes the region within which all
   locations map to the same service URI or set of URIs for a given
   service.  A service boundary may consist of several non-contiguous
   geometric shapes.

   Mapping

   Mapping is a process that takes a location and a service identifier
   as inputs and returns one or more URIs.  Those URIs can point either
   to a host providing that service or to a host that in turn routes the
   request to the final destination.


3.  Overview of Architecture

   Before the WSD can query a trusted WSDB for a list of available
   frequencies or channels for use in the white space spectrum, the WSD
   must first discover the available databases and addresses serving the
   regulatory domain in which the device is currently located.  At
   power-up the WSD does not reliably know the regulatory domain
   corresponding to its current location, and therefore does not
   reliably know with which white space database(s) it can communicate.
   Furthermore it is essential that the WSD connect with a trusted WSDB
   for proper operation and indeed regulatory compliance.

   While it is possible that a WSD knows its location, or information
   which may be used to derive its location, it is not reasonable for
   every WSD to be capable to translate this information into the
   current regulatory domain, i.e. the WSD needs assistance to know what
   is the regulatory environment with jurisdiction at its current
   location.

   A WSDB Discovery Server (DS) takes as input location information from
   the WSD and returns to the WSD one or more addresses of WSDBs (or
   WSDB listing servers as appropriate) to the WSD.  If the address or
   addresses of these WSDB DSs are included in the WSD firmware, a
   secure starting point for a trusted relationship is established.

   Figure 1 shows at a high level how white space master devices
   discover a suitable trusted white space database.  In this document
   we describe how the master device may collect the addresses of one or
   more white space database.  Steps and criteria to sort multiple
   addresses into a priority order is left to implementation and not
   specified.  Procedures to contact a white space database are
   specified in PAWS PROTOCOL [PAWS PROTOCOL].  Steps and criteria to
   determine the suitability of a particular white space database are
   also not considered in this document.

   After master device has selected a suitable database for service, it
   can then use the PAWS protocol PAWS PROTOCOL [PAWS PROTOCOL] to
   retrieve the available spectrum for its location.

                       available spectrum from WSDB

   (1) Discovery Request procedure.  This message is used by master
   device to query available WSDB from WSDB DS; it conveys master's
   location and some other related information to WSDB DS.

   (2) Discovery Response procedure.  This procedure conveys the
   regulatory domain and either the address of a listing server or the
   address of one or more WSDB authorized to provide service where the
   WSD is physically located to the master device.  If spectrum access
   is not authorized at the WSD physical location, the response will
   contain an error code and no address information.

   After WSDB discovery procedure, the master device can query available
   white space spectrum from the WSDB using PAWS protocol.

3.1.  System Architecture

   The discovery system is based on client-server model; the basic model
   is shown as Figure 3, where WSDB DB plays the role of server.

                    Figure 3: DB discovery system model

   For the discovery mechanism to work well, some assumptions have to be
   considered:

   (1) Master device can get its geo-location directly or indirectly.

   (2) Master device has gotten the URL (or IP address) of a trusted
   WSDB DS before starting the discovery procedure.

   By including contact information of a trusted WSDB DS in the WSD's
   programmed instructions or firmware, the WSD can reliably determine
   the address of a trusted database listing server, as appropriate for
   its current physical location.  Because the WSDB DS is selected by
   the WSD manufacturer, a foundation is set to ensure the WSD will be
   able to discover a trusted WSDB in every regulatory domain where the
   manufacturer expects the WSD to be used.  The address of at least one
   WSDB DS is included in the WSD operating instructions or firmware by
   the manufacturer for example or provisioned using device
   configuration mechanisms.

   When the WSD does not have the address of a serviceable WSDB (e.g. at
   power-up), the WSD sends a Discovery Request message to a WSDB DS.
   The WSD includes in the Discovery Request information about its
   current location.  The WSDB DS uses this location information to
   determine the regulatory domain where the WSD is located, and returns
   a Discovery Response message which includes the address of one or
   more WSDBs (or WSDB listing server as appropriate) to the WSD.


4.  Specification

   LoST (Location to Service Translation Protocol) is a protocol for
   mapping a service identifier (URN) and location information to one or
   more service URLs and associated information.  LoST mapping queries
   can contain either civic or geodetic location information.  LoST
   queries can be resolved recursively or iteratively.

   LoST messages are carried in HTTP and HTTPS protocol exchanges,
   facilitating use of TLS for protecting the integrity and
   confidentiality of requests and responses.

   This discovery mechanism utilizes LoST to communicate between master
   device and WSDB DS, the master device acts as LoST client and WSDB DS
   plays the role of LoST server.  The protocol stack is shown in Figure
   4.  To use LoST for this discovery mechanism, several issues have to
   be clarified.

4.1.  Issues to be clarified

4.1.1.  Service Identifier

   A new service identifier for PAWS database discovery needs to be
   defined, according to RFC5031 [RFC5031], a top-level service and a
   sub-service are defined here.

         +----------------+-------------------------------------+
         |     Service    |             Description             |
         +----------------+-------------------------------------+
         |      paws      |      top-level service of PAWS      |
         | paws.discovery | the PAWS database discovery service |
         +----------------+-------------------------------------+

                                  Table 1

   So according to the service-identifying labels defined above, the
   service URN for PAWS database discovery service is as follow:

   urn:service:paws.discovery

4.1.2.  Conveying of regulatory domain

   The name of regulatory domain can be conveyed using <displayName>
   element in the LoST response message.

   [Note: the format and content of the regulatory domain information
   are TBD.]

4.2.1.  Discovery Request procedure

   The discovery request procedure uses the <findService> query message
   of LoST for conveying parameters.  Master device's location
   information will be included in the <location> element.

   The service identifier defined in section 5.1.1 is specified in the
   <service>element.

   The following is an example of discovery request procedure message,
   using geodetic coordinates.

4.2.2.  Discovery Response procedure

   The discovery response procedure uses the <findServiceResponse>
   response message of LoST for conveying parameters.

   After receiving the <findService> query message, the WSDB DS will map
   the location information and service identifier to one or more
   available WSDBs' URL.

   Then in the <findServiceResponse> message, a list of WSDBs' URL and
   regulatory domain that has jurisdiction over the current location
   will be conveyed to master device.  The regulatory domain is
   contained in <displayName> element.

   The service boundary of the WSDB can also be included in the response
   message to indicate the region for which the service URL returned
   would be the same as in the actual query.  Or a service boundary
   reference can be returned to master device, and master device
   retrieve service boundary by this reference as needed.  Next time
   when the master device powers up, if its location is within the

4.2.3.  Recursion and Iteration

   If the WSDB DS can not provide available WSDB for master device, then
   it may wish other WSDB DS to serve the master device's query request.
   In LoST, recursion and iteration patterns are provided for this
   purpose.

   In recursive mode, the LoST server initiates queries on behalf of the
   requester and returns the result to the requester.

   In iterative mode, the server contacted returns a redirection
   response indicating the next server to be queried if the server
   contacted cannot provide an answer itself.
