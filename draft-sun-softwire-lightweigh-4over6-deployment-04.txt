            Deployment Considerations for Lightweight 4over6
          draft-sun-softwire-lightweigh-4over6-deployment-04

Abstract

   Lightweight 4over6 is a mechanism which moves the translation
   function from tunnel lwAFTR (AFTR) to lwB4s (B4s), and hence reduces
   the mapping scale on the lwAFTR to per-customer level.  This document
   discusses various deployment models of Lightweight 4over6.  It also
   describes the deployment considerations and applicability of the
   Lightweight 4over6 architecture.

1.  Introduction

   Lightweight 4over6 [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] is an extension to
   DS-Lite which simplifies the AFTR module [RFC6333] with distributed
   NAT function among B4 elements.  The lwB4 in Lightweight 4over6 is
   provisioned with an IPv6 address, an IPv4 address and a port-set.  It
   performs NAPT on end user's packets with the provisioned IPv4 address
   and port-set.  IPv4 packets are forwarded between the lwB4 and the
   lwAFTR over a Softwire using IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation.  The lwAFTR
   maintains one mapping entry per subscriber with the IPv6 address,
   IPv4 address and port-set.  Therefore, this extension removes the
   NAT44 module from the AFTR and replaces the session-based NAT table
   to a per-subscriber based mapping table.  This should relax the
   requirement to create dynamic session-based log entries.  This
   mechanism preserves the dynamic feature of IPv4/IPv6 address binding
   as in DS-Lite, so it has no coupling between IPv6 address and IPv4
   address/port-set as any full stateless solution ([RFC6052] or
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-map]) requires.  This document discusses
   deployment models of Lightweight 4over6.  It also describes the
   deployment considerations and applicability of the Lightweight 4over6
   architecture.

   Terminology of this document follows the definitions and
   abbreviations of [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6].

3.  Deployment Model

   Lightweight 4over6 is suitable for operators who would like to free
   any correlation of the IPv6 address with IPv4 address and port-set
   (or port-range).  In comparison to full stateless solutions like MAP
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-map] and 4rd [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd], Lightweight
   4over6 frees address planning of IPv6 delegation for CPE from mapping
   rule administration and management in the network.  Thus, IPv6
   addressing is completely flexible to fit other deployment
   requirements, e.g., auto-configuration, service classification, user
   management, QoS support, etc.  The philosophy here is that bits of
   IPv6 address should be left for IPv6 usage first.

   Lightweight 4over6 can be deployed in a residential network (depicted
   in Figure1).  In this scenario, a lwB4 would acquire an IPv4 address
   and a port-set after a successful user authentication process and
   IPv6 provisioning process.  Then, it establishes an IPv4-in-IPv6
   softwire using the IPv6 address to deliver IPv4 services to its
   connected host via the lwAFTR in the network.  The lwB4 can act as a
   CPE, or software located in the host.  The lwAFTR supports
   Lightweight 4over6 which keeps the mapping between lwB4's IPv6
   address and its allocated IPv4 address + port set.  The supporting
   system may keep the binding information as well for logging and user
   management.

   Figure 1 Deployment Model

   There are two deployment models in practice: one is called bottom-up
   and the other is top-down.  In bottom-up model, after port-restricted

   IPv4 address is allocated to a given subscriber, the lwAFTR will
   report mapping records to the supporting system on creating a binding
   for traffic logging if necessary.  Operators may use
   [I-D.ietf-behave-syslog-nat-logging] or
   [I-D.ietf-behave-ipfix-nat-logging] to report the port set allocated
   by lwAFTR.  In this way, the lwAFTR can determine the binding by its
   own and there is little impact on existing network architecture.  In
   top-down model, the Supporting system should firstly determine the
   binding information for each subscriber and then synchronize it with
   the lwAFTR.  With this method, one binding record can be easily
   synchronized with multiple lwAFTRs and stateless failover can be
   achieved.  However, new mechanism (e.g.
   [I-D.zhou-dime-4over6-provisioning]) needs to be introduced to notify
   each individual binding record between the Supporting system and the
   lwAFTR.

4.  Overall Deployment Considerations

4.1.  Addressing and Routing

   In Lightweight 4over6, there is no inter-dependency between IPv4 and
   IPv6 addressing schemes.  IPv4 address pools are configured
   centralized in lwAFTR for IPv6 subscribers.  These IPv4 prefix must
   advertise to IPv4 Internet accordingly.

   For IPv6 addressing and routing, there are no additional addressing
   and routing requirements.  The existing IPv6 address assignment and
   routing announcement should not be affected.  For example, in PPPoE
   scenario, a CPE could obtain a prefix via prefix delegation
   procedure, and the hosts behind CPE would get its own IPv6 addresses
   within the prefix through SLAAC or DHCPv6 statefully.  This IPv6
   address assignment procedure has nothing to do with restricted IPv4
   address allocation.

4.2.  Port-set Management

   In Lightweight 4over6, each lwB4 will get its restricted IPv4 address
   and a port-set after successful user authentication process and IPv6
   provisioning process.  This port-set assignment can been achieved by
   DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6] and PCP
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-port-set].

   Operator may use DHCPv4 to provision IPv4 address to the lwB4.  In a
   typical deployment, the DHCP server is a centralized DHCP server and
   lwAFTR is the DHCP relay agent to relay the dhcp messages to the
   server over unicast.  Rarely DHCP server will collocate with the
   lwAFTR to provision IPv4 resources to the lwB4.

   Operator may also use PCP Port-set Option to provision IPv4 address
   and port-set to the lwB4.  In a typical deployment, PCP server will
   collocate with lwAFTR, and the subscriber's binding can be determined
   by lwAFTR.  The PCP request should be sent to the lwAFTR's tunnel
   end-point address.  It is not common that PCP server will be
   centralized deployed in which the lwAFTR is the PCP proxy to relay
   PCP requests.

   It is also possible that subscriber's binding is determined in AAA
   server.  In this case, the BNGs will embed with a DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6
   server function which allows them to locally handle any DHCPv4-over-
   DHCPv6 requests initiated by hosts.  The AAA server will pass the
   subscriber's binding to a BNG using the AAA attribute in [I-D.sun-
   softwire-lw4over6-radext] and in turn populates the mapping of the
   lwB4.

Internet-Draft        lightweigh-4over6-deployment             July 2013


   Some operators may offer different service level agreements (SLA) to
   users that some users may require more ports then others.  In this
   deployment scenario, the operator can implement differentiated
   policies in provisioning system specified to a user's lwB4 or a group
   of lwB4s to allocate a certain range of port-set.  The lwAFTR may
   also run multiple instances with different port-set sizes to build
   the mapping table.

4.3.  lwAFTR Discovery

   A Lightweight 4over6 lwB4 must discover the lwAFTR's IPv6 address
   before offering any IPv4 services.  This IPv6 address can be learned
   through an out-of-band channel, static configuration, or dynamic
   configuration.  In practice, Lightweight 4over6 lwB4 can use the same
   DHCPv6 option [RFC6334]to discover the FQDN of the lwAFTR.

   When Lightweight 4over6 is deployed in the same place with DS-Lite,
   either different FQDNs can be configured for Lightweight 4over6 and
   DS-Lite separately or different DHCPv6 options can be used for
   Lightweight 4over6 [I-D.sun-softwire-lw4over6-dhcpv6] and DS-Lite.
   More detailed considerations on DS-Lite compatibility will be
   discussed in Section6.

4.4.  Impacts on Accouting

   In Lightweight 4over6, the accounting impact due to the tunneling
   protocol is the same with DS-Lite (see section 6.2 of [RFC6908]).
   However, since in Lightweight 4over6, the IPv4 service is only
   available after port-set allocation, if operators will regard IPv4
   service as a on-demand value-added service, e.g.  IPv6 connectivity
   is offered by default, while IPv4 connectivity will be offered untill
   a subscriber requires, etc., IPv4 service accounting should start
   after port-set allocation has completely.

5.  lwAFTR Deployment Consideration

   As Lightweight 4over6 is an extension to DS-Lite, both technologies
   share similar deployment considerations.  For example: Interface
   consideration, Lawful Intercept Considerations, Blacklisting a shared
   IPv4 Address, AFTR's Policies, AFTR Impacts on Accounting Process,
   etc., in [RFC6908] can also be applied here.  This document only
   discusses new considerations specific to Lightweight 4over6.

5.1.  Logging at the lwAFTR

   In Lightweight 4over6, operators only log one entry per subscriber.
   The log should include subscriber's IPv6 address used for the
   softwire, the public IPv4 address and the port-set.  The port set
   algorithm implemented in Lightweight 4over6 lwAFTR should be
   synchronized with the one implemented in logging system.  For
   example, if contiguous port set algorithm is adopted in the lwAFTR,
   the same algorithm should also been applied to the logging system.

   Since the mapping in lwAFTR does not contain destination-specific
   information, operator should be aware that they will not be able to
   have destination-specific log.

5.2.  MTU and Fragmentation Considerations

   As Lightweight 4over6 is also a tunneling protocol, the same
   consideration regarding to the fragmentation and reassembly in DS-
   Lite [RFC6908] can also be applied.  The only difference is that NAT
   functionality has been removed to lwB4 from lwAFTR in Lightweight
   4over6.  Therefore, on receiving an IPv4 fragmented packet after
   decapsulation in the lwB4, the lwB4 should further re-assemble the
   packets before doing NAT since the transport protocol information is
   only available in the first fragment.

5.3.  Reliability Considerations of lwAFTR

   Operators may deploy multiple lwAFTRs for robustness, reliability,
   and load balancing.  In Lightweight 4over6, subscriber to IPv4 and
   port-set mapping must be pre-provisioned in the lwAFTR before
   providing IPv4 serives.  For redundancy, the backup lwAFTR must
   either have the subscriber mapping already provisioned or notify the
   lwB4 to create a new mapping in the backup lwAFTR.  The first option
   can be considered as Hot Standby mode, which requires state
   syncronization between multiple lwAFTRs.  In Hot Standby mode, the
   bindings are replicated on-the-fly from the Primary lwAFTR to the
   Backup lwAFTR.  When the Primary lwAFTR fails, the Backup lwAFTR will
   take over all the existing established sessions.  In this mode, the
   internal hosts are not required to re-initiate the bindings with the



Sun, et al.             Expires January 15, 2014                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft        lightweigh-4over6-deployment             July 2013


   external hosts.  In Lightweight 4over6, since the number of mapping
   states has been greatly reduced compared to DS-Lite, it is reasonable
   to adopt Hot Standby mode when there are only two lwAFTRs (one for
   Primary lwAFTR and one for Backup lwAFTR).  However, if the number of
   lwAFTRs is larger than two, it is not scalable to deploy Hot Standby
   mode since each two of the lwAFTRs should to syncronize the binding
   states.

   The second option is to use Cold Standby mode which does not require
   a Backup Standby lwAFTR to synchronize binding states.  In failover,
   the lwAFTR has to notify the lwB4 to create a new binding, or fetch
   the binding by itself.  [I-D.lee-softwire-lw4over6-failover]
   describes these two approaches for simple Cold Standby mode.  For
   most deployment scenarios, we believe that Cold Standby mode should
   be sufficient enough and is thus recommended.

5.4.  Placement of AFTR

   The lwAFTR can be deployed in a "centralized model" or a "distributed
   model".

   In the "centralized model", the lwAFTR could be located at the higher
   place, e.g. at the exit of MAN, etc.  Since the lwAFTR has good
   scalability and can handle numerous concurrent sessions, we recommend
   to adopt the "centralized model" for Lightweight 4over6 as it is
   cost-effective and easy to manage.

   In the "distributed model", lwAFTR is usually integrated with the
   BRAS/SR.  Since newly emerging customers might be distributed in the
   whole Metro area, we have to deploy lwAFTR on all BRAS/SRs.  This
   will cost a lot in the initial phase of the IPv6 transition period.

5.5.  Port set algorithm consideration

   If each lwB4 is given a set of ports, port randomization algorithm
   can only select port in the given port-set.  This may introduce
   security risk because hackers can make a more predictable guess of
   what port a subscriber may use.  Therefore, non-continuous port set
   algorithms (e.g. as defined in [I-D.ietf-softwire-map]) can be used
   to improve security.

5.6.  Path Consistency Consideration

   In Lightweight 4over6, if the binding state is not syncronized among
   multiple lwAFTRs, the lwAFTR in which the subscriber's binding state
   is stored should be exactly the one to service the subscriber.
   Otherwise, there will be no match in lwAFTR.  This requires the

   should arrive at the same lwAFTR as the subsquent IP-in-IP traffic.
   If multiple lwAFTRs are using the same Tunnel End Point address and
   there are intermediate routers between lwB4 and lwAFTR, there might
   be a problem when intermediate routers perform ECMP based on L4 hash
   for the plain provionsion packets while doing L3 hash for subsequent
   IP-in-IP traffic.  In this case, it is recommended that the
   privioning packet is sent over IPv6 tunnel so that intermediate
   routers can only process ECMP using L3 hash.

6.  lwB4 Deployment Consideration

   For lwB4 consideration, the DNS Deployment Considerations and B4
   Remote Management in [RFC6908] can also be applied here.  In this
   section, we only describe the considerations sepcific to Lightweight
   4over6.

6.1.  NAT traversal issue

   In Lightweight 4over6, since the subscriber's source port will be
   restricted to the port-set allocated from the provisioning system,
   this will have impact on some NAT traversal mechanisms.  For example,
   in UPnP 1.0, the external port number which can be used by remote
   peer is selected by UPnP client in end host.  If the client randomly
   selects a port number which is not in that valid port-set, the UPnP
   process will fail.  This is likely to happen because end-host does
   not know the port-set in lwB4.  More detailed experimental results
   can be found in [I-D.deng-aplusp-experiment-results].  This problem
   will not exist in UPnP 2.0 because the UPnP client in the end-host
   will negotiate the external port number with the server.  Another way
   is to implement a mechanism (e.g.  [I-D.ietf-pcp-port-set], etc.) in
   end host to fetch the port-set from lwB4.  The UPnP client can then
   select the port number within the port-set.

6.2.  Static Port Forwarding Configuration

   Currently, some external initiated applications rely on manual port
   configuration to reserve a port in the CPE.  The restricted port-set
   in lwB4 will also have impacts on manual port forwarding
   configuration.  It is recommended that the port-set allocated from
   the provioning system should be shown explicitly in the lwB4, which
   can be used as a hint for subscribers to add port forwarding mapping.

7.  DS-Lite Compatibility Consideration

   Lightweight 4over6 can be either deployed all alone, or combined with
   DS-Lite [RFC6333].  Since Lightweight 4over6 does not any have extra
   requirement on IPv6 addressing, it can use use the same addressing
   scheme with DS-Lite, together with routing policy, user management
   policy, etc.  Besides, the bottom-up model has quite similar
   requirement and workflow on the supporting system with DS-Lite.
   Therefore, it is suitable for operators to deploy incrementally in
   existing DS-Lite network

7.1.  Case 1: Integrated Network Element with Lightweight 4over6 and DS-
      Lite AFTR Scenario

   In this case, DS-Lite has been deployed in the network.  Later in the
   deployment schedule, the operator decided to implement Lightweight
   4over6 lwAFTR function in the same network element(depicted in
   Figure2).  Therefore, the same network element needs to support both
   transition mechanisms.

   There are two options to distinguish the traffic from two transition
   mechanisms.

   The first one is to distinguish using the client's source IPv4
   address.  The IPv4 address from Lightweight 4over6 is public address
   as NAT has been done in the lwB4, and IPv4 address for DS-lite is
   private address as NAT will be done on AFTR.  When the network
   element receives an encapsulated packet, it would de-capsulate packet
   and apply the transition mechanism based on the IPv4 source address
   in the packet.  This requires the network element to examine every
   packet and may introduce significant extra load to the network
   element.  However, both the B4 element and Lightweight 4over6 lwB4
   can use the same DHCPv6 option [RFC6334] with the same FQDN of the
   AFTR and lwAFTR.

   The second one is to distinguish using the destination's tunnel IPv6
   address.  One network element can run separated instances for
   Lightweight 4over6 and DS-Lite with different tunnel addresses.  Then
   B4 element and Lightweight 4over6 lwB4 can use the same DHCPv6 option
   [RFC6334] with different FQDNs pointing to corresponding tunnel
   addresses.  This requires the supporting system should distinguish
   different types of users when assigning the FQDNs in DHCPv6 process.
   Another option is to use a new DHCPv6 option
   [I-D.sun-softwire-lw4over6-dhcpv6] to discover lwAFTR's FQDN.

7.2.  Case 2: DS-Lite Coexistent scenario with Separated AFTR

   This is similar to Case 1.  The difference is the lwAFTR and AFTR
   functions won't be co-located in the same network element (depicted
   in Figure3).  This use case decouples the functions to allow more
   flexible deployment.  For example, an operator may deploy AFTR closer
   to the edge and lwAFTR closer to the core.  Moreover, it does not
   require the network element to pre-configure with the CPE's IPv6
   addresses.  An operator can deploy more AFTR and lwAFTR at needed.
   However, this requires the B4 and lwB4 to discover the corresponding
   network element.  In this case, B4 element and Lightweight 4over6
   lwB4 can still use [RFC6334] with different FQDNs pointing to
   corresponding tunnel end-point addresses, and the supporting system
   should distinguish different types of users.

1.  Appendix:Experimental Result

   We have deployed Lightweight 4over6 in our operational network of
   HuNan province, China.  It is designed for broadband access network,
   and different versions of lwB4 have been implemented including a
   linksys box, a software client for windows XP, vista and Windows 7.
   It can be integrated with existing dial-up mechanisms such as PPPoE,
   etc.  The major objectives listed below aimed to verify the
   functionality and performance of Lightweight 4over6:

   o  Verify how to deploy Lightweight 4over6 in a practical network.

   o  Verify the impact of applications with Lightweight 4over6.

   o  Verify the performance of Lightweight 4over6.

   BRASs for configuration, while the public available IPv4 address
   pools are configured by the centralized lwAFTR with a default address
   sharing ratio.  It is rather flexible for IPv6 addressing and
   routing, and there is little impact on existing IPv6 architecture.

   In our experiment, lwB4 will firstly get its IPv6 address and
   delegated prefix through PPPoE, and then initiate a PCP-extended
   request to get public IPv4 address and its valid port set.  The
   lwAFTR will thus create a subscriber-based state accordingly, and
   notify syslog server with {IPv6 address, IPv4 address, port set,
   timestamp}.

1.2.  Experimental results

   In our trial, we mainly focused on application test and performance
   test.  The applications have widely include web, email, Instant
   Message, ftp, telnet, SSH, video, Video Camera, P2P, online game,
   voip and so on.  For performance test, we have measured the
   parameters of concurrent session numbers and throughput performance.

   The experimental results are listed as follows:

   +--------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+

   The performance test for lwAFTR is taken on a normal PC.  Due to
   limitations of the PC hardware, the overall throughput is limited to
   around 800 Mbps.  However, it can still support more than one hundred
   million concurrent sessions.

1.3.  Conclusions

   From the experiment, we can have the following conclusions:

   o  Lightweight 4over6 has good scalability.  As it is a lightweight
      solution which only maintains per-subscription state information,
      it can easily support a large amount of concurrent subscribers.

   o  Lightweight 4over6 can be deployed rapidly.  There is no
      modification to existing addressing and routing system in our
      operational network.  And it is simple to achieve traffic logging.

   o  Lightweight 4over6 can support a majority of current IPv4
      applications.
