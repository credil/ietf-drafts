Abstract

   Some members of the implementation community have expressed confusion
   about the rules and algorithms for processing Internationalized
   Resource Identifiers (IRIs).  This document aims to clarify these
   matters and improve interoperability around IRI processing by
   summarizing the steps required to prepare and parse arbitrary Unicode
   strings as Internationalized Resource Identifiers.  Further goals of
   this document are to define limited scheme-specific rules around IRI
   processing and to define the steps required for producing the
   canonical form of an IRI.

Internet-Draft               IRI Guidelines                    July 2011


1.  Introduction

   Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) extend the Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) specification [RFC3986] by opening up the
   authority, path, query, and fragment components to the character
   space available in Unicode/ISO 10646.  Arbitrary Unicode strings may
   be prepared and parsed into IRI sub-components which map directly to
   the same URI sub-components.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   This section defines terminology used in this document.  Unicode
   characters are referred to using the notation described in section 3
   of [RFC5137].  A Unicode code point is represented as U+NNNN where
   the NNNN string consists of the code point's hexadecimal numbers.

   reference-string
   The original and unprocessed input string being considered as an IRI
   reference.

   pre-processed-reference-string
   The reference-string that has been through the pre-processing steps.

   relative reference
   The term "relative reference" used in this document can be
   interpreted according to the rules in section 4.2 of [RFC3986] using
   the additionally allowed characters that [RFC3987] permits in each
   component.

   percent-encode
   Convert each octet of a sequence to %HH, where HH is the hexadecimal
   notation of the octet value.


3.  Sources

   This document makes reference to the following sources of information
   about the parsing of IRIs:

4.  Pre-processing Arbitrary Unicode Strings

   This section describes the pre-processing steps required to prepare
   an arbitrary Unicode reference-string for later parsing into IRI sub-
   components.

   1.  Remove leading and trailing instances of ASCII whitespace
       characters U+0020 SPACE, U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR), U+000A LINE
       FEED (LF), and U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION from the string.  Note
       that Unicode has many more characters that are considered
       whitespace, none of which are affected or considered in this
       rule.
       Reference: Section 7.2 of [RFC3987] for details.
   2.  If more than one reference is allowed, split the string into
       substrings on blocks of contiguous U+0020 SPACE characters.  Each
       of one of these substrings is an independent reference-string and
       will be processed individually.  If more than one reference is
       not allowed, either remove blocks of contiguous whitespace or
       replace each U+0020 SPACE with a single percent-encoded U+0020
       SPACE, written as "%20", depending on what is required for the
       current context.
       Reference: Mentioned in [4].
   3.  If the current string is not already in a Unicode encoding, then
       transcode the string to the a Unicode encoding such as UTF-8,
       UTF-16, or UTF-32.
       Reference: Section 3.1 of [RFC3987].
   4.  TODO: Should numerical character references be replaced with
       their corresponding character? e.g. <htt&#x0070;://
       www.example.com/&#x0066;&#x006f;&#x006f;bar&#x002f;foo&#

       x003f;bar> would become <http://www.example.com/foobar/foo?bar>
       during this step.  Or should this step of unescaping be limited
       to the <iunreserved> set?

   This is the pre-processed-reference-string ready for parsing.


5.  Parsing Unicode Strings into IRI Components

   With an arbitrary IRI string that has been through pre-processing,
   referred to as the "pre-processed-reference-string", this section
   describes the subsequent process of parsing the string into its five
   major IRI sub-components using rules defined by [RFC3896] (using an
   algorithm equivalent to Appendix B of [RFC3986]) but with updated
   ABNF of [RFC3987].  These rules are summarized here.
   Reference: Section 3.2 of [RFC3987].

5.1.  Identify the scheme

   If the current string does not contain a ":" U+003A then the string
   does not contain a scheme and the pre-processed-reference-string may
   be handled as a relative reference according to the rules in section
   4.2 of [RFC3986] using the additionally allowed characters that
   [RFC3987] permits.

   o  Continue to "Identify the path"
   o  Abort further scheme processing

   If the first character of the string is not an <ALPHA> then this is
   not a valid scheme and the pre-processed-reference-string may be
   handled as a relative reference.

   o  Continue to "Identify the path"
   o  Abort further scheme processing

   Consume all characters up to but not including the first occurrence
   of ":" U+003A. If the consumed substring contains any characters
   other than < ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "-" / "." > then it is not a valid
   scheme and the pre-processed-reference-string may be handled as a
   relative reference.

   o  Continue to "Identify the path"
   o  Abort further scheme processing

   The consumed substring at this point is the scheme.  Skip over the
   ":" U+003A character.  Continue parsing the remaining string as an
   authority part.

Internet-Draft               IRI Guidelines                    July 2011


5.2.  Identify the authority

   The URI authority component may contain userinfo, a host, and a port.
   If the current string does not begin with the two characters "//"
   U+002F U+002F then the string is not an authority and may be handled
   as a path sub-component.

   o  Continue to "Identify the path"
   o  Abort further authority processing

   Consume up to the first occurrence of any one of the authority's
   terminating characters "/" U+002F, "?"  U+003F, "#" U+0023, or the
   end of the string.  This is the authority, also known as the
   iauthority under IRI RFC3987.  Continue further parsing of the
   authority to identify the userinfo, host, and port parts.

5.2.1.  Identify the userinfo

   The userinfo may come in the form of a username and password rendered
   as "user:password".  The userinfo part may be parsed according to the
   rules of RFC3986 Section 3.2.1 with the updated ABNF for iuserinfo in
   RFC3987.

   If the authority does not contain a "@" U+0040 then the string does
   not contain a userinfo part and the authority may be parsed for a
   host and port part.

   o  Continue to "Identify the host"
   o  Abort further userinfo processing

   From the beginning of the authority, consume each character up to but
   not including the first occurrence of "@" U+0040.  This is the
   userinfo.

   Further parsing of the userinfo is scheme-specific.

   Skip over the first occurrence of "@" U+0040 following the userinfo,
   and continue parsing the remaining authority to identify the host.

5.2.2.  Identify the host

   The host part of authority may contain an IP-literal, IPv4address, or
   a reg-name according to the ABNF rules of RFC3986 updated to support
   Unicode characters in the ireg-name as described in RFC3987.  Consume
   all characters up to but not including the last ":" U+003A character
   or the end of authority.

   If this substring is determined to be an IP-literal or IPv4address,

Internet-Draft               IRI Guidelines                    July 2011


   then the consumed characters are the host.

   o  If the authority did contain a ":" then continue parsing the
      remaining authority including the ":" character according to the
      "Identify the port" section
   o  Abort further host processing

   Else the substring is determined to be an ireg-name according to the
   ABNF naming convention from RFC3987.  This is the host.

   o  If the authority did contain a ":" then the remaining authority
      including the ":" character will be processed according to the
      "Identify the port".
   o  Continue processing the host

   The host SHOULD be processed according to the rules of IDNA2008, but
   MAY be processed according to UTS46 or IDNA2003.  If the host is in
   DNS Internet dot-notaion then it's labels SHOULD be converted to
   punycode.  This is the host.
   TODO: Error handling.  Mention leaving the host name in pure Unicode
   form for intranet/local name scenarios that don't use DNS, e.g.
   WINS?

5.2.3.  Identify the port

   Further processing SHOULD skip the first occurrence of ":" U+003A and
   consume the remaining characters.  If these characters are not *DIGIT
   then the port is invalid.

   o  Continue to "Identify the path"
   o  Abort further scheme processing

   Else this is the port.

5.3.  Identify the path

   Consume the remaining pre-processed-reference-string up to but not
   including the first occurrence of a terminating character "?"
   U+003F, "#" U+0023, or the end of the string.

   Percent-encode all characters present from the ucschar list.

   If the path contains any characters not allowed by the ABNF of
   RFC3987 Section 2.2 or Section 7.2 then replace those characters with
   their percent-encoding.

   This is the path.

   If the terminating character was "?" then process the remaining
   string including the leading "?" according to "Identify the query".

   If the terminating character was "#" then process the remaining
   string including the leading "#" according to "Identify the
   fragment".

   TODO: Handling of special characters "/" and "\".

5.4.  Identify the query

   Consume the remaining string starting with the leading "?" and up to
   but not including the first occurrence of "#" or the end of the
   string.

   Percent-encode all characters present from the ucschar list.

   If the path contains any characters not allowed by the ABNF of
   [RFC3987] Section 2.2 or the lists in Section 7.2 then replace those
   characters with their percent-encoding.

   This is the query component.

   If the terminating character was "#" then process the remaining
   string including the leading "#" according to "Identify the
   fragment".

   TODO: Handling of special characters "&", "?", "=", and "/"

5.5.  Identify the fragment

   Consume the remaining string starting with the leading "#" and to the
   end of the string.

   Percent-encode all characters present from the ucschar list.

   This is the fragment.

   TODO: Handling of special characters "?" and "/"

6.1.  http

   (NOTE: Taken directly from [RFC3987]) For compatibility with existing
   deployed HTTP infrastructure, the following special case applies for
   schemes "http" and "https" and IRIs whose origin has a document
   charset other than one which is UCS-based (e.g., UTF-8 or UTF-16).
   In such a case, the "query" component of an IRI is mapped into a URI
   by using the document charset rather than UTF-8 as the binary
   representation before pct-encoding.  This mapping is not applied for
   any other scheme or component.
   Reference: Section 3.5 and 7.2 of [RFC3987].

6.2.  javascript

   TODO reference?
   http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hoehrmann-javascript-scheme-03

6.3.  mailto

   TODO reference [RFC6068]

6.4.  data

   TODO reference [RFC2397]


7.  IRI Canonicalization

   To follow.

   [NOTE: Call out Special Case here or earlier?  The U+005C should be
   either percent-encoded or converted to U+002F. Of course, folks who
   want to name such files will want to use the escaped form of \ in
   order for their site to work in other browsers.

7.1.  Producing a valid URI from an IRI

   For each character which is not allowed anywhere in a valid URI,
   apply the following steps.
   Reference: Section 3.5 of [RFC3987].
   o  Convert the IRI to the UTF-8 encoding, i.e., convert the character
      to a sequence of one or more octets using UTF-8 [RFC3629].
      TODO: What about they query and fragment components?  Should the
   o  For each IRI component, percent-encode each UTF-8 octet
      representing each character that is not allowed in the same URI
      component.  In general this will include the set of characters
      specified by ucschar of [RFC3987].
