1.  Introduction

   [RFC3183] specifies Domain Security Services using S/MIME.  The
   motivation provided there remains largely the same.  This document
   specifies a simplified variant of Domain Security Services to be used
   between an MSA/MTA and an MTA/MDA.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  MSA-to-MDA S/MIME signing & encryption

   An MSA/MTA wishing to sign or encrypt an email message on bahalf of a
   domain ("originating S/MIME MSA" or "originating S/MIME MTA") follows
   rules specified in [RFC3183], except as specified in this document.

   Originating S/MIME MSA/MTA uses a domain signature as specified in
   [RFC3183].  However the rules below replace naming rules specified in
   Sections 3.1.1 and 4.1 of that document.

   The subject name of the Originating S/MIME MSA/MTA's X.509
   certificate is not restricted as specified in RFC 3183.  In order for
   a verifier to recognize a signing/encrypting certificate as the
   Originating S/MIME MSA/MTA's certificate, it MUST contain
   uniformResourceIdentifier GeneralName of the format "smtp://<fully-
   qualified-domain>" in its SubjectAltName.  (Here <fully-qualified-
   domain> is the domain that is being served by the signing/encrypting
   MSA/MTA.)  An rfc822Name GeneralName as specified in RFC 3183 MAY
   optionally be included in the SubjectAltName.

   [[Do we need to distinguish signing versa encryption in certificate's
   SubjectAltName?]]
