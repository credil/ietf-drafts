                    PCP Authentication Requirements
                      draft-reddy-pcp-auth-req-03

Abstract

   In an attempt to reach consensus on a PCP authentication mechanism,
   this document describes requirements for PCP authentication.  It is
   hoped this can serve as the basis for a comparison of PCP
   authentication mechanisms.

1.  Introduction

   This document derives requirements for PCP Authentication from PCP
   deployment scenarios and scope described in PCP-base
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] and other PCP drafts.  The document focuses on
   requirements and does not make a suggestion on the authentication
   mechanism to be used to satisfy requirements.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This note uses terminologies defined in [RFC4949] such as realm,
   security association, identity, credential etc.

3.  Requirements

   REQ-1:  PCP MUST provide client authentication.  PCP client and
      server MUST also be able to mutually authenticate.  Mutual

Internet-Draft           PCP Auth Requirements                  May 2013


      authentication is especially necessary when the PCP server is
      located in a different administrative domain from the PCP client.
      Credentials to gain access to the network could be different from
      the credentials used to authenticate with the PCP server.

      *  The identity details of the client could be used by the PCP
         server to grant access to certain PCP opcodes or PCP options.
         For example GUESTS might not be permitted to use the MAP opcode
         and only ADMINISTRATOR might be permitted to use the
         THIRD_PARTY option.

      *  The identity details of the client could be used for auditing.

   REQ-2:  PCP Authentication MUST generate security association for
      integrity protection of PCP request and response.  This and all
      subsequent requirements are not applicable to multicast PCP
      responses like ANNOUNCE.

   REQ-3:  A PCP server MUST be able to indicate that a request will not
      be processed without authentication.

   REQ-4:  If a PCP client authenticates with a PCP server,

      a.  The client MUST be able to verify the integrity and origin of
          responses from the server.

      b.  The server MUST be able to send authenticated unsolicited
          responses.

      c.  If a PCP response does not include integrity related to a
          current security association, then those messages MUST NOT be
          trusted without soliciting an integrity protected version.

      d.  If the server wants to send an unsolicited message, but the
          previous security association association for the mapping
          identified in the original PCP request has expired

          1.  The server can continue to use the same SA to protect
              messages pertaining to that mapping, even if the SA is
              technically expired.

              -  Such server notifications will not change state in the
                 PCP client.

              -  The notification could be a trigger for the client to
                 re-authenticate.  For example, if the server indicates
                 that external IP address/port has changed, the PCP
                 client can then re-authenticate with the server to

Internet-Draft           PCP Auth Requirements                  May 2013


                 confirm if the external IP address/port for the mapping
                 has indeed changed.

          2.  The server MUST be able to optionally trigger re-
              authentication with the client.

   REQ-5:  It is important that PCP not leak privacy information between
      the PCP client and PCP server,

      a.  The authentication mechanism MUST be able to keep credentials
          hidden from eavesdroppers on path between the client and
          server.

      b.  Confidentiality of the PCP messages is OPTIONAL for PCP
          request and response of opcodes MAP, PEER, ANNOUNCE and
          options THIRD_PARTY, PREFER_FAILURE and FILTER as explained in
          PCP-base [I-D.ietf-pcp-base].  Other PCP drafts MUST evaluate
          if confidentiality is OPTIONAL for new PCP opcodes and options
          introduced.

      c.  PCP authentication SHOULD be immune to passive dictionary
          attacks.

      d.  PCP Authentication MUST ensure that an attacker snooping PCP
          messages cannot guess the SA.

   REQ-6:  To ease troubleshooting and ensure fate sharing, PCP
      authentication and PCP messages MUST be multiplexed over the same
      port.

   REQ-7:  PCP authentication MUST accommodate authentication between
      administrative domains.  For example, a PCP client may wish to
      communicate directly to an ISP's PCP server, even though the in-
      home CPE router does not support PCP.  In this scenario the PCP
      client needs to directly authenticate with the ISP's PCP server.

   REQ-8:  For the scenarios described in REQ-7, the PCP authentication
      mechanism MUST be functional across address and port translation,
      including NAPT64 and NAPT44.

   REQ-9:  A PCP proxy that modifies PCP requests and/or responses
      before forwarding messages:

      +------------+                       |
      | PCP Client |-----+                 |

                             | PCP Proxy |-------|PCP Server|

      a.  MUST be able to validate message integrity of PCP messages
          from the PCP server and client respectively.

      b.  MUST be able to ensure message integrity after updating the
          PCP message for cases described in sections 6 and 7 of
          [I-D.ietf-pcp-proxy].

   REQ-10:  It is RECOMMENDED that PCP authentication support a
      mechanism where authentication on one port MUST be usable on other
      ports without requiring another authentication exchange for other
      ports.  For example, there could multiple applications on the host
      like BitTorrent [BitTorrent], WebRTC[I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview]/SIP
      [RFC3261] using PCP.  Multiple authentication exchanges increase
      load on the PCP server and chatter on the network.  For example,
      if 'N' messages are to be exchanged for PCP authentication and 'M'
      independent applications implement their own PCP client, a total
      of N*M messages have to be exchanged and 'M' number of SAs
      maintained for each host.

   REQ-11:  It is RECOMMENDED to choose a widely deployed authentication
      technique with known security properties rather than inventing a
      new authentication mechanism.

   REQ-12:  Changes in PCP to accommodate authentication SHOULD be
      minimal so that updates and additions to the authentication
      mechanism have minimal bearing on modifying PCP.

4.  Third Party Authorization

   REQ-13: In addition to a two party authentication that has been
   discussed in this draft, a mechanism for third party authorization
   MUST also be supported.  This is applicable in cases where a third
   party authorizes the use of a resource on a PCP server for a desired
   PCP client.  For example, as depicted in Figure 1 , a PCP request to
   a PCP capable firewall authorized by a SIP proxy rather than by
   virtue of the end user making the PCP request.  The PCP server is to
   permit a PCP MAP request from the PCP client if the user is making a
   SIP call with the Enterprise or a trusted SIP server in 3rd party
   network, otherwise do not allow MAP request from that particular
   user.  In this scenario the first party is the user, second party is
   the PCP server (which is also the firewall) and the third party is

   the SIP server, where the user is authorized to use MAP request only
   when making a call using the trusted SIP Server.

5.  Other recommendations

      REQ-14: There SHOULD be support for a means to provide integrity
      protection without user authentication, i.e., integrity protection
      for PCP messages exchanged between a PCP server and anonymous PCP
      clients.  For example, a client visiting foreign networks such as
      a hotel, hot spot etc where the client may gain access to the
      network but does not know the credentials to authenticate with the
      PCP server.

      a.  An SA MUST be made available to the client and server, which
          will be used for integrity protection of PCP messages.  The
          negotiation of SA should be secure such that the SA is only
          known to the anonymous client and PCP server.

      b.  A PCP client MUST be able to validate that it is communicating
          with the designated PCP server and not an attacker posing as a
          PCP server.
