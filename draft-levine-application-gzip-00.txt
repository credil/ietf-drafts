1.  Introduction

   The Zlib [RFC1950] and gzip [RFC1952] formats are widely used
   compression formats.  Zlib is a stream format, while glib adds header
   and trailer fields more appropriate for a file format.  They are used
   to compress a wide variety of material, from unstructured text to
   structured data to executable code.

2.  The Application/Zlib Media Type

   The application/zlib media type describes a block of data that is
   compressed using Zlib [RFC1950] compression.  The data is a stream of
   bytes as described in RFC 1950.

2.1.  Regsistration Details

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: zlib

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: none

   Encoding considerations: needs base64 or other encoding that allows
   arbitrary binary data

   Security considerations: See section [security] below

   Interoperability considerations: none

   Published specification: [RFC1950]

   Applications that use this media type: anywhere data size is an issue

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s): first byte is usually 0x78 but can also be 0x08,
      0x18, 0x28, 0x38, 0x48, 0x58, or 0x68.
      File extension(s): none
      Macintosh file type code(s): none

   Person and email address to contact for further information: see

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Restrictions on usage: none

3.  The Application/Gzip Media Type

   The application/gzip media type describes a block of data that is
   compressed using gzip [RFC1952] compression.  The data is a stream of
   bytes as described in RFC 1952.

3.1.  Regsistration Details

   Type name: application

4.  Security Considerations

   Zlib and gzip compression can be used to compress arbitrary binary
   data such as hostile executable code.  Also, data that purports to be
   in zlib or gzip format may not be, and fields that are supposed to be
   flags, lengths, or pointers, could contain anything.  Applications
   should treat any data with due scepticism.
