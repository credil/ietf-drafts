       A questionable method for mitigating namespace collisions
           draft-wkumari-dnsop-defense-collision-mitigate-00

Abstract

   This document outlines a method to mitigate the effect of collisions
   in the DNS namespace by providing a means for end users to
   disambiguate the conflict.

1.  Introduction / Background

   Collisions in the DNS occur in multiple ways; one common case is that
   an organization has used an sub-domain (foo) of their primary domain
   (example.com) for corporate infrastructure, and then the string "foo"
   is delegated as a TLD.  When a employee of the organization enters
   'www.foo', are they trying to reach a machine in the internal
   namespace (www.foo.example.com) or the hostname 'www' in the 'foo'
   TLD?

   This document describes a means of disambiguating these, and similar
   cases.

2.  Mitigation

   The mitigation described in this document involves presenting the
   multiple options to the user, and allowing them to indicate which of
   the names is the one they were trying to reach, and then connecting
   to that.

   This could be accomplished in a number of ways, including:

      Intercepting the resolution requests from the application in a
      "shim" type library

      Replacing the resolver library entirely

      Integrating this type of mitigation into applications (some web
      browsers already do something similar to this)

      Running a resolver locally on the workstation / host that return
      the address of a proxy.

   The mitigation would lookup the name in multiple namespaces, and if a
   conflict is detected, it would then provide a means for the user to
   choose which one of the colliding names they wish to connect to, and

   return the unambiguated answer to the application.  An additional
   feature could be for the described mitigation to cache the user's
   choice, and / or provide a means to set priorities.

   There are a nuamber of issues with this solution, including but not
   limited to:

   o  There may not be a human avaialble to disambiguate the answer
      (unattended machines, ATMs, etc).

   o  The human / user may have no idea which is the correct choice.

   o  The additional latency introduced may cause the originating
      application to time out.

   o  The user experiance may be horrid.

3.  Implementation / Disclaimers

   This document does not reference an implementation as it is unclear
   if the idea is worth implementing - this document exists primarily so
   that searches for prior-art will find this, and to prevent nefarious
   deeds.  The idea itself may be / probably is horrendous, but it
   anyone wants to give it a whirl, everyone should be able to give it a
   whirl.

   This is a very slight mitigation.  It should not be viewed as a
   solution to the "namespace collision" issue.  The author is not
   planning on revising this draft.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document contains no IANA considerations.

5.  Security Considerations

   Yes, there probably are some.  Don't do this then.

6.  Acknowledgements

   The authors wish to thank some folk, including Tarquin F'tang-F'tang-
   Ole-Biscuitbarrel.
