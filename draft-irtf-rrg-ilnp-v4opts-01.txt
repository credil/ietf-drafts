Abstract

   This document defines 2 new IPv4 options that are used only with
   ILNP for IPv4 (ILNPv4).  ILNP is is an experimental, evolutionary
   enhancement to IP. This document is a product of the IRTF Routing
   RG.

1. INTRODUCTION

   The Identifier Locator Network Protocol (ILNP) is an proposal for
   evolving the Internet Architecture.  It differs from the current
   Internet Architecture primarily by deprecating the concept of an
   IP Address, and instead defining two new objects, each having

Internet Draft     ILNP-IPv4-Opts     26 MAR 2012


   crisp syntax and semantics.  The first new object is the Locator,
   a topology-dependent name for a subnetwork.  The other new object
   is the Identifier, which provides a topology-independent name for
   a node.

1.1  ILNP Document Roadmap

   The ILNP Architecture document [ILNP-ARCH] is the best place to
   start reading about ILNP.  ILNP has multiple instantiations.
   [ILNP-ENG] discusses engineering and implementation aspects
   common to all instances of ILNP.  This document discusses
   engineering and implementation details that are specific to ILNP
   for IPv4 (ILNPv4).  [ILNP-DNS] describes new Domain Name System
   (DNS) resource records used with ILNP.  [ILNP-ICMPv4] defines the
   ICMP Locator Update message used with ILNPv4.  Other documents
   describe ILNP for IPv6 (ILNPv6) [ILNP-ICMPv6] [ILNP-NONCE6].

1.2  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
   in RFC2119. [RFC2119]

2.  IPv4 Options for ILNPv4

   ILNP for IPv4 (ILNPv4) is merely a different instantiation of the
   ILNP architecture, so it retains the crisp distinction between
   the Locator and the Identifier.  As with ILNP for IPv6 (ILNPv6),
   when ILNPv4 is used for a network-layer session, the upper-layer
   protocols (e.g. TCP/UDP pseudo-header checksum, IPsec Security
   Association) bind only to the Identifiers, never to the Locators.
   As with ILNPv6, only the Locator values are used for routing and
   forwarding ILNPv4 packets.

   However, just as the packet format for IPv4 is different to IPv6,
   so the engineering details for ILNPv4 are different also. Just as
   ILNPv6 is carefully engineered to be backwards-compatible with
   IPv6, ILNPv4 is carefully engineered to be backwards-compatible
   with IPv4.

2.1  ILNPv4 Packet Format

   The Source IP Address in the IPv4 header becomes the Source
   ILNPv4 Locator value, while the Destination IP Address of the
   IPv4 header becomes the Destination ILNPv4 Locator value.  Of
   course, backwards compatibility requirements mean that ILNPv4
   Locators use the same number space as IPv4 routing prefixes.

Internet Draft     ILNP-IPv4-Opts     26 MAR 2012


   ILNPv4 uses the same 64-bit Identifier, with the same modified
   EUI-64 syntax, as ILNPv6.  Because the IPv4 address fields are
   much smaller than the IPv6 address fields, ILNPv4 cannot carry
   the Identifier values in the fixed portion of the IPv4 header.
   The obvious two ways to carry the ILNP Identifier with ILNPv4
   are either as an IPv4 Option or as an IPv6-style Extension Header
   placed after the IPv4 header and before the upper-layer protocol
   (e.g. OSPF, TCP, UDP, SCTP).

   Currently deployed IPv4 routers from multiple router vendors use
   packet forwarding silicon that is able to parse past IPv4 options
   to examine the upper-layer protocol header at wire-speed on
   reasonably fast (e.g. 1 Gbps or better) network interfaces. By
   contrast, no existing IPv4-capable packet forwarding silicon is
   able to parse past a new Extension Header for IPv4.  Hence, for
   engineering reasons, ILNPv4 uses a new IPv4 Option to carry the
   Identifier values.  Another new IPv4 option also carries a nonce
   value, performing the same function for ILNPv4 as the IPv6 Nonce
   Destination Option [ILNP-NONCE6] performs for ILNPv6.

   ## need to verify units used for IPv4 options (bytes vs words)
   ## option length is in bytes (octets) according to RFC791
   ## also, RFC791 implies that the start of option headers must
   ## aligned to 32-bit boundaries, but not that they should be
   ## a multiple of 32-bits in length

   The Source Identifier and Destination Identifier are unsigned
   64-bit integers. [ILNP-ENG] specifies the syntax, semantics,
   and generation of ILNP Identifier values.  Using the same
   syntax and semantics for all instantiations of ILNP Identifiers
   simplifies specification and implementation, while also
   facilitating translation or transition between ILNPv4 and
   ILNPv6 should that be desirable in future.

   This IP option MUST NOT be present in an IPv4 packet unless
   the packet is part of an ILNPv4 session.  ILNPv4 sessions
   MUST include this option in the first few packets of each
   session, and MAY include this option in all packets of the
   session.  It is RECOMMENDED to include this option in all
   packets of the session if packet loss higher than normal.

   ## NB: Need to verify units used for IPv4 options (bytes vs words)

   This option contains a 48-bit ILNP Nonce.  As noted in [ILNP-
   ARCH] and [ILNP-ENG], all ILNP Nonce values are unidirectional.
   This means, for example, that a typical TCP/ILNPv4 session will
   have two different NONCE values: one from Initiator to Responder
   and another from Responder to Initiator. The ILNP Nonce is used
   to provide non-cryptographic protection against off-path attacks
   (e.g. forged ICMP messages from the remote end of a TCP session).

   Each NONCE value MUST be unpredictable (i.e. cryptographically
   random).  Guidance to implementers on generating
   cryptographically random values is provided in [RFC4086].

   This IP option MUST NOT be present in an IPv4 packet unless the
   packet is part of an ILNPv4 session.  ILNPv4 nodes MUST include
   this option in the first few packets of each ILNP session, MUST
   include this option in all ICMP messages generated by endpoints
   participating in an ILNP session, and MAY include this option in
   all packets of an ILNPv4 session.


3.  SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

   Security considerations for the overall ILNP Architecture are
   described in [ILNP-ARCH].  Additional common security
   considerations are described in [ILNP-ENG].  This section
   describes security considerations specific to ILNPv4 topics
   discussed in this document.

   If the ILNP Nonce value is predictable, then an off-path attacker
   might be able to forge data or control packets.  This risk also
   is mitigated by the existing common practice of IP Source Address
   filtering [RFC2827] [RFC3704].

Internet Draft     ILNP-IPv4-Opts     26 MAR 2012


   IP Security for ILNP [ILNP-ENG] [RFC4301] provides cryptographic
   protection for ILNP data and control packets. The ILNP Nonce
   option is required in the circumstances described in Section 3,
   even if IP Security is also in use.  Deployments of ILNPv4 in
   high-threat environments SHOULD use IP Security for additional
   risk reduction.

   This option is intended to be used primarily end-to-end between a
   source node and a destination node.  However, unlike IPv6, IPv4
   does not specify a method to distinguish between options with
   hop-by-hop behaviour versus end-to-end behaviour.

   [ID-IPv4-OPT-FILTERING] provides general discussion of potential
   operational issues with IPv4 options, along with specific advice
   for handling several specific IPv4 options.  Further, many
   deployed modern IP routers (both IPv4 and IPv6) have been
   explicitly configured to ignore all IP options, even including
   the "Router Alert" option, when forwarding packets not addressed
   to the router itself.  Reports indicate this has been done to
   preclude use of IP options as a (Distributed) Denial-of-Service
   (D)DOS attack vector on backbone routers.

4.  IANA CONSIDERATIONS

   IANA is requested to assign new IPv4 option values for the ILNPv4
   Identifier option (ILNPv4_ID) and the ILNPv4 Nonce option
   (ILNPv4_NONCE) in accordance with the procedures of [RFC2780].
   The short name for ILNPv4_ID is "ID", for consistency with
   [ILNP-DNS], and the short name for ILNPv4_NONCE is "INONCE".

   Each of these options MUST be copied upon fragmentation.
   Each of these options is used for control, so uses Option Class 0.

   This section is to be removed prior to publication.

   This document is written in English, not American.  So English
   spelling is used throughout, rather than American spelling.
   This is consistent with existing practice in several other RFCs,
   for example RFC-5887.

   This document tries to be very careful with history, in the
   interest of correctly crediting ideas to their earliest
