Internet-Draft       SIP Forum UA Config Service Tag        January 2010


1.  Introduction

   The SIP Forum [1] User Agent Configuration Recommendation [SFUACFG]
   defines a procedure for SIP [RFC3261] User Agents to

   1.  determine the SIP domain from which to request configuration,

   2.  construct a URL for and request configuration from the
       configuration service provide by that domain,

   3.  request that the configuration service send notices of any
       changes to that configuration.

   Two of the steps (1 and 2) in this process are accomplished in whole
   or in part using the DDDS Applications defined in [RFC3958] and
   [RFC4848].

   This document registers the application service tags for use with
   these applications.


2.  SFUA.PAN Application Service Tag Registration

   One of the mechanisms by which a SIP User Agent can determine the DNS
   name for the SIP domain for which it is to be configured is to accept
   as user input a string of decimal digits to identify the SIP domain.
   This digit string is called a "Provider Alias Number" (PAN).  The PAN
   is resolved to a DNS domain name using the S-NAPTR (Simple NAPTR)
   DDDS application defined in [RFC3958].

   This document registers the following S-NAPTR application service tag
   for this purpose:

                  +-------------------------+-----------+
                  | Application Service Tag | SFUA.PAN  |
                  | Defining Publication    | [SFUACFG] |
                  +-------------------------+-----------+


3.  SFUA.CFG Application Service Tag Registration

   Having obtained the DNS name of a SIP domain from which to request
   configuration, the SIP User Agent must construct an https base URL
   with which to request configuration from the the configuration
   service for that domain.  To obtain the base URL, the User Agent
   resolves the SIP domain name using the U-NAPTR (URI-Enabled NAPTR)
   DDDS application defined in [RFC4848].

Internet-Draft       SIP Forum UA Config Service Tag        January 2010


   This document registers the following U-NAPTR application service tag
   for this purpose:

                  +-------------------------+-----------+
                  | Application Service Tag | SFUA.CFG  |
                  | Defining Publication    | [SFUACFG] |
                  +-------------------------+-----------+


4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of the various parts of the SIP Forum
   User Agent Configuration Recommendation are discussed in its defining
   specification: [SFUACFG].  There are no known security implications
   of registering these specific application service tag values.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests registration of the Application Service Tag
   values "SFUA.PAN" and "SFUA.CFG" in the registry defined by
   [RFC3958].

              Status: this document has successfully completed SIP Forum
              Technical Working Group Last Call.  The only substantive
              changes anticipated between the current draft and the
              final 1.0 version of the Recommendation are the references
              to this document and two other Internet Drafts on which it
              depends, and any revisions needed to harmonize it with the
              final versions of those dependencies.
