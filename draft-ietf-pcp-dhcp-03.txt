Internet-Draft              PCP DHCP Options                    May 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document defines DHCPv4 [RFC2131] and DHCPv6 [RFC3315] options
   which can be used to provision PCP Server [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] names.

   In order to make use of these options, this document assumes
   appropriate name resolution means (e.g., Section 6.1.1 of [RFC1123])
   are available on the host client.

   The use of DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 depends on the PCP deployment scenarios.


2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   o  PCP Server denotes a functional element which receives and
      processes PCP requests from a PCP Client.  A PCP Server can be co-
      located with or be separated from the function (e.g., NAT,
      Firewall) it controls.  Refer to [I-D.ietf-pcp-base].
   o  PCP Client denotes a PCP software instance responsible for issuing
      PCP requests to a PCP Server.  Refer to [I-D.ietf-pcp-base].
   o  DHCPv4 refers to the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [RFC2131]
      for IPv4.
   o  DHCP refers to both DHCPv4 [RFC2131] and DHCPv6 [RFC3315].
   o  DHCP client (or client) denotes a node that initiates requests to
      obtain configuration parameters from one or more DHCP servers
      [RFC3315].
   o  DHCP server (or server) refers to a node that responds to requests
      from DHCP clients [RFC3315].
   o  Name is a domain name (as per Section 3.1 of [RFC1035]) that
      contains one or more labels.  In particular, a PCP name may be
      structured as DNS qualified name or be composed of strings such as
      can be passed to getaddrinfo (Section 6.1 of [RFC3493]), including
      address literals, etc.


3.  Rationale

   Both IP Address and Name DHCP options have been considered in early
   stages of this specification.  This flexibility aims to let service
   providers to make their own engineering choices and use the
   convenient option according to their deployment context.
   Nevertheless, DHC WG's position is this flexibility have some
   drawbacks such as inducing errors.  Therefore, only the Name option
   is maintained within this document.

   This document defines an option to carry a name rather than an IP

   address.  This choice is motivated by operational considerations: In
   particular, some Service Providers are considering two levels of
   redirection:

   (1)  The first level is national-wise and undertaken by DHCP: a
        regional-specific Name will be returned;
   (2)  The second level is done during the resolution of the regional-
        specific Name to redirect the customer to a regional PCP server
        among a pool deployed regionally.

   Distinct operational teams are responsible for each of the above
   mentioned levels.  A clear separation between the functional
   perimeter of each team is a sensitive task for the maintenance of the
   offered services.  Regional teams will require to introduce new
   resources (e.g., new PCP-controlled devices such as Carrier Grade
   NATs (CGNs, [I-D.ietf-behave-lsn-requirements])) to meet an increase
   of customer base.  Operations related to the introduction of these
   new devices (e.g., addressing, redirection, etc.) are implemented
   locally.  Having this regional separation provides flexibility to
   manage portions of network operated by dedicated teams.  This two-
   level redirection can not be met by the IP Address option.

   In addition to the operational considerations:
   o  The use of the Name for NAT64 [RFC6146] might be suitable for
      load-balancing purposes;
   o  For the DS-Lite case [RFC6333], if the encapsulation mode is used
      to send PCP messages, an IP address may be used since the AFTR
      selection is already done via the AFTR_NAME DHCPv6 option
      [RFC6334].  Of course, this assumes that the PCP Server is co-
      located with the AFTR function.  If these functions are not co-
      located, conveying the Name would be more convenient.


4.  DHCPv6 PCP Server Option

   This DHCPv6 option conveys a domain name to be used to retrieve the
   IP addresses of PCP Server(s).  Appropriate name resolution queries
   should be issued to resolve the conveyed name.

4.1.  Format

   The format of the DHCPv6 PCP Server option is shown in Figure 1.

                  Figure 1: PCP Server Name DHCPv6 Option

   The fields of the option shown in Figure 1 are as follows:

   o  Option-code: OPTION_PCP_SERVER (TBA, see Section 9.1)
   o  Option-length: Length of the 'PCP Server Domain Name' field in
      octets.
   o  PCP Server Domain Name: The domain name of the PCP Server to be
      used by the PCP Client.  The domain name is encoded as specified
      in Section 8 of [RFC3315].

   The OPTION_PCP_SERVER option can include multiple PCP Server Domain
   Names; each Name is treated as a separate PCP Server.

4.2.  Client Behaviour

   To discover a PCP Server [I-D.ietf-pcp-base], the DHCPv6 client MUST
   include an Option Request Option (ORO) requesting the DHCPv6 PCP
   Server Name option as described in Section 22.7 of [RFC3315] (i.e.,
   include OPTION_PCP_SERVER on its OPTION_ORO).

   If the DHCPv6 client receives an OPTION_PCP_SERVER option from the
   DHCPv6 server, it extracts the Name(s) conveyed in the
   OPTION_PCP_SERVER option and proceeds to validating it.  The DHCPv6
   client MUST verify that the option length does not exceed 255 octets
   [RFC1035]).  The DHCPv6 client MUST verify the name(s) is properly
   encoded as detailed in Section 8 of [RFC3315].

   Once each Name conveyed in the OPTION_PCP_SERVER option is validated,
   each included Name is passed to the name resolution library (e.g.,
   Section 6.1.1 of [RFC1123] or [RFC6055]) to retrieve the
   corresponding IP address(es) (IPv4 or IPv6).  Then, the PCP Client
   MUST follow the procedure specified in Section 6 to contact its PCP
   Server(s).

   It is RECOMMENDED to associate a validity lifetime with any address
   resulting from resolving the Name conveyed in a OPTION_PCP_SERVER
   DHCPv6 option when stored in a local name resolution cache.
   Considerations on how to flush out a local cache are out of the scope

   of this document.

   A host may have multiple network interfaces (e.g, 3G, WiFi, etc.);
   each configured differently.  Each PCP Server learned MUST be
   associated with the interface via which it was learned.  When an
   application issues a PCP request to a PCP Server, the source address
   of the request MUST be among those assigned on the interface to which
   the destination PCP Server is bound.


5.  DHCPv4 PCP Option

5.1.  Format

   The PCP Server Name DHCPv4 option can be used to configure a name to
   be used by the PCP Client to contact a PCP Server.  The format of
   this option is illustrated in Figure 2.


          Code  Length   PCP Server Domain Name
         +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--
         | TBA |  n  |  s1 |  s2 |  s3 |  s4 | s5  |  ...
         +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--


   The values s1, s2, s3, etc. represent the domain name labels in the
   domain name encoding.

                  Figure 2: PCP Server Name DHCPv4 Option

   The description of the fields is as follows:
   o  Code: OPTION_PCP_SERVER (TBA, see Section 9.2);
   o  Length: Includes the length of the "PCP Server Domain Name" field
      in octets; The maximum length is 255 octets.
   o  PCP Server Domain Name: The domain name of the PCP Server to be
      used by the PCP Client when issuing PCP messages.  The encoding of
      the domain name is described in Section 3.1 of [RFC1035].

   The OPTION_PCP_SERVER option can include multiple PCP Server Domain
   Names; each Name is treated as a separate PCP Server.

5.2.  Client Behaviour

   DHCPv4 client expresses the intent to get OPTION_PCP_SERVER by
   specifying it in Parameter Request List Option [RFC2132].

   If the DHCPv4 client receives an OPTION_PCP_SERVER option from the
   DHCPv4 server, it extracts the Name(s) conveyed in the option and

Internet-Draft              PCP DHCP Options                    May 2012


   proceeds to validating it.  The DHCPv4 client MUST verify that the
   option length does not exceed 255 octets [RFC1035]).  If more than
   one Name is included in a OPTION_PCP_SERVER option, and once each
   name conveyed in the OPTION_PCP_SERVER option is validated, each
   included Name is passed to the name resolution library (e.g., Section
   6.1.1 of [RFC1123] or [RFC6055]) to retrieve the corresponding IPv4
   address(es).

   The PCP Client MUST follow the procedure specified in Section 6 to
   contact its PCP Server(s).

   It is RECOMMENDED to associate a validity lifetime with any address
   resulting from resolving the Name conveyed in a OPTION_PCP_SERVER
   DHCPv4 option when stored in a local name resolution cache.
   Considerations on how to flush out a local cache are out of the scope
   of this document.

   A host may have multiple network interfaces (e.g, 3G, WiFi, etc.);
   each configured differently.  Each PCP Server learned MUST be
   associated with the interface via which it was learned.  When an
   application issues a PCP request to a PCP Server, the source address
   of the request MUST be among those assigned on the interface to which
   the destination PCP Server is bound.


6.  IP Address Selection

   This section specifies the behavior to be followed by the PCP Client
   to contact its PCP Server(s) when receiving one or several PCP Names:

   1.  If only one PCP Name is received: if a list of IP addresses is
       returned as a result of resolving the name conveyed in the PCP
       Name DHCP option, the PCP Client follows the procedure specified
       in Section 6.1.
   2.  If several PCP Names are received: each Name is treated as a
       separate PCP Server.  Moreover, each Name may be resolved into
       one IP address or a list of IP addresses.  The PCP Client
       contacts in parallel the first IP address of each Name and
       follows the procedure specified in Section 6.1 for the list of IP
       addresses returned for each Name.  Section 6.2 provides some
       examples to illustrate this procedure.

6.1.  Serial Queries

   The PCP Client initializes its retransmission timer, RETRY_TIMER, to
   2 seconds.  The PCP Client sends its PCP message to the PCP Server
   and waits 2 seconds for a response.  If no response is received, it
   doubles the value of RETRY_TIMER, sends another (identical) PCP

Internet-Draft              PCP DHCP Options                    May 2012


   message and waits 2*RETRY_TIMER.  This procedure is repeated three
   (3) times, doubling the value of RETRY_TIMER each time.  If no
   response is received after four (4) attempts, the PCP Client tries
   with the next IP address in its list of PCP Servers.  If it has
   exhausted its list, the procedure is repeated every fifteen minutes
   until the PCP request is successfully answered.  If, when sending PCP
   requests the PCP Client receives an ICMP error (e.g., port
   unreachable, network unreachable) it SHOULD immediately try the next
   IP address in the list.  Once the PCP Client has successfully
   received a response from a PCP Server on that interface, it sends
   subsequent PCP requests to that same server until that PCP Server
   becomes non-responsive, which causes the PCP client to attempt to re-
   iterate the procedure starting with the first PCP Server on its list.

6.2.  Examples

   Let's suppose pcpserver-x, pcpserver-y and pcpserver-z are returned
   as PCP Names in a OPTION_PCP_SERVER option.  Let's also suppose:

   * IPx1 and IPx2 are returned for pcpserver-x; IPx1 is not reachable.
   * IPy1 and IPy2 are returned for pcpserver-y; IPy1 is reachable
   * IPz1 and IPz2 are returned for pcpserver-z; IPz1 is reachable

   The procedure to contact the PCP Servers is as follows:

   * Send PCP requests to all servers: IPx1, IPy1 and IPz1
   * Responses are received from IPy1 and IPz1 but not from IPx1
     - The request is re-sent to IPx1
     - If no response is received after four attempts, the request
       is sent to IPx2

   Now, if the following conditions are made:

   * IPx1 and IPx2 are returned for pcpserver-x; IPx1 is not reachable.
   * IPy1 and IPy2 are returned for pcpserver-y; IPy1 is reachable
   * IPz1 and IPz2 are returned for pcpserver-z; IPz1 is not reachable

   The procedure to contact the PCP Servers lead to the following:

   * Send PCP requests to all servers: IPx1, IPy1 and IPz1
   * A response is received from IPy1 but not from IPx1 and IPz1
     - the requests are re-sent to IPx1 and IPz1
     - If no response is received after four attempts, the request
       is then sent to IPx2 and IPz2

   Let's suppose now that:

   * IPx1 and IPx2 are returned for pcpserver-x; IPx1 is not reachable.
   * IPy1 and IPy2 are returned for pcpserver-y; IPy1 is not reachable
   * IPz1 and IPz2 are returned for pcpserver-z; IPz1 is not reachable

   The procedure to contact the PCP Servers is as follows:

   * Send PCP requests to all servers: IPx1, IPy1 and IPz1
   * No answer is received for all requests
     - the requests are re-sent to IPx1, IPy1 and IPz1
     - If no response is received after four attempts, the request
       is then sent to IPx2, IPy2 and IPz2


7.  Dual-Stack Hosts

   A PCP Server configured using OPTION_PCP_SERVER over DHCPv4 is likely
   to be resolved to IPv4 address(es).

   A PCP Server configured using OPTION_PCP_SERVER over DHCPv6 may be
   resolved to IPv4-mapped IPv6 address(es) or IPv6 address(es) (e.g.,
   NAT64 [RFC6146], IPv6 firewall [RFC6092], NPTv6 [RFC6296]).

   In some deployment contexts, the PCP Server may be reachable with an
   IPv4 address but DHCPv6 is used to provision the PCP Client.  In such
   scenarios, a plain IPv4 address or an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address can be
   configured to reach the PCP Server.

   A Dual-Stack host may receive OPTION_PCP_SERVER via both DHCPv4 and
   DHCPv6.  The content of these OPTION_PCP_SERVER options may refer to
   the same or distinct PCP Servers.  This is deployment-specific and as
   such it is out of scope of this document.


8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC2131], [RFC3315] and
   [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] are to be considered.


9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  DHCPv6 Option
