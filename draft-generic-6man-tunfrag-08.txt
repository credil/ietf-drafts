Abstract

   IP fragmentation has long been subject for scrutiny since the
   publication of "Fragmentation Considered Harmful" in 1987.  This work
   cast fragmentation in a negative light that has persisted to the
   present day.  However, the tone of the work failed to honor two
   principles of creative thinking: never say "always" and never say
   "never".  This document discusses uses for fragmentation that apply
   both to the present day and moving forward into the future.

Internet-Draft            IPv6 Path MTU Updates                July 2013


1.  Introduction

   IP fragmentation has long been subject for scrutiny since the
   publication of "Fragmentation Considered Harmful" in 1987 [FRAG].
   This work cast fragmentation in a negative light that has persisted
   to the present day.  However, the tone of the work failed to honor
   two principles of creative thinking: never say "always" and never say
   "never".  This document discusses uses for fragmentation that apply
   both to the present day and moving forward into the future.


2.  Problem Statement

   The de facto "Internet cell size" is effectively 1500 bytes, i.e.,
   the minimum maximum Transmission Unit (minMTU) configured by the vast
   majority of links in the Internet.  IPv6 constrains this even further
   by specifying a minMTU of 1280 bytes and a minimum Maximum Reassembly
   Unit (minMRU) of 1500 bytes [RFC2460].  IPv4 specifies both minMTU/
   minMRU as only 576 bytes [RFC0791][RFC1122], although it is widely
   assumed that the vast majority of nodes will configure an IPv4 minMRU
   of at least 1500 bytes.

   The 1280 IPv6 minMTU originated from a November 14, 1997 mailing from
   Steve Deering to the IPng mailing list, which stated:

      "In the ipngwg meeting in Munich, I proposed increasing the IPv6
      minimum MTU from 576 bytes to something closer to the Ethernet MTU
      of 1500 bytes, (i.e., 1500 minus room for a couple layers of
      encapsulating headers, so that min- MTU-size packets that are
      tunneled across 1500-byte-MTU paths won't be subject to
      fragmentation/reassembly on ingress/egress from the tunnels, in
      most cases).

      ...

      The number I propose for the new minimum MTU is 1280 bytes (1024 +
      256, as compared to the classic 576 value which is 512 + 64).
      That would leave generous room for encapsulating/tunnel headers
      within the Ethernet MTU of 1500, e.g., enough for two layers of
      secure tunneling including both ESP and AUTH headers."

   However, there was a fundamental flaw in this reasoning .  In
   particular to avoid fragmentation for several nested layers of
   encapsulation, the first tunnel (T1) would have to set a 1280 MTU so
   that its tunneled packets would emerge as 1320 bytes (1280 bytes plus
   40 bytes for the encapsulating IPv6 header).  Then, the next tunnel
   (T2) would have to set a 1320 MTU so its tunneled packets would
   emerge as 1360.  Then the next tunnel (T3) would have to set a 1360

   MTU so that its tunneled packets would emerge as 1400, etc. until the
   available path MTU is exhausted.  The question is, how can those
   nested tunnels be so carefully coordinated so that there would never
   be an MTU infraction?  In a single administrative domain where an
   operator can lay hands on every tunnel ingress this may be possible,
   but in the general case it cannot be expected that the nested tunnel
   MTUs would be so well orchestrated.  It is therefore necessary to
   consider as a limiting condition a tunnel that configures a 1280 MTU
   in which the tunnel crosses a link (perhaps another tunnel) that also
   configures a 1280 MTU.  In that case, the tunnel ingress has two
   choices: 1) perform fragmentation that the tunnel egress needs to
   reassemble, or 2) shut down the tunnel due to failure to meet the
   IPv6 minMTU requirement.

   In addition, it is becoming increasingly evident that Path MTU
   Discovery (PMTUD) [RFC1981] does not work properly in all cases.
   This is due to the fact that the Packet Too Big (PTB) messages
   required for PMTUD can be lost due to network filters that block
   ICMPv6 messages [RFC2923][WAND][SIGCOMM][RIPE].  It is therefore
   necessary to consider the case where IPv6 packets are dropped
   silently in the network due to a size restriction, but the IPv6
   source host never receives the necesary indication from the network
   that the packet was lost.  The source host must therefore support
   some form of IP fragmentation in order to ensure that isolated large
   packets are delivered, as well as a packet size probing capabilitiy
   (see: [RFC4821]) to ensure that large packets that are part of a
   coordinated stream are making it through to the destination.

   Due to these considerations, there are at least two use cases for
   network layer fragmentation that must be satisfied now and for the
   long term.  In the following sections, we discuss these
   considerations in more detail.


3.  IPv6 Hosts Sending Large Isolated Packets

   IPv6 hosts that send large isolated packets have no way of ensuring
   that the packets are delivered to the final destination if their size
   exceeds the path MTU.  The host must therefore perform network layer
   fragmentation to a fragment size of no larger than 1280 bytes to
   ensure that the fragmented packets are delivered to the destination
   without loss due to a size restriction.  However, the destination
   node need only configure a minMRU size of 1500 bytes per the IPv6
   specs.  Therefore, the source must either limit its packet sizes to
   1500 bytes (i.e., before fragmentation) or somehow have a way of
   determining that the destination configures a larger minMRU.  Two
   uses for this host-based fragmentation to support large isolated
   packets are OSPVFv3 and DNS.

4.  IPv6 Tunnels

   IPv6 tunnels are used for many purposes, including transition,
   security, mobility, routing control, etc.  While it is assumed that
   transition mechanisms will eventually give way to native IPv6, it is
   clear that the use of tunnels for other purposes will continue and
   even expand.  A long term strategy for dealing with tunnel MTUs is
   therefore required.

   Tunnels may cross links (perhaps even other tunnels) that configue
   only the IPv6 minMTU of 1280 bytes while the tunnel ingress must be
   able to send packets that are at least 1280 bytes in length so that
   the IPv6 minMTU is extended to the source.  However, these tunneled
   packets become (1280 + HLEN) bytes on the wire (where HLEN is the
   length of the encapsulating headers), meaning that they would be
   vulerable to loss at a link within the tunnel that configures a
   smaller MTU.  Therefore, the only way to satisfy the IPv6 minMTU is
   through network layer fragmentation and reassembly between the tunnel
   ingress and egress, where the ingress fragments its tunneled packets
   that are larger than (1280 - HLEN) bytes.

   Unfortunately, fragmentation and reassembly are a pain point for in-
   the-network routers - especially for those that are nearer the core
   of the network.  It is therefore highly desirable for the tunnel
   ingress to discover whether this fragmentation and reassembly can be
   avoided.  This can only be done by allowing the ingress to probe the
   path to the egress by sending whole 1500 byte probe packets to
   discover whether the probes can be delivered to the egress without
   fragmentation.  These 1500 byte probes appear as (1500 + HLEN) bytes
   on the wire, therefore the path must support an MTU of at least this
   size in order for the probe to succeed.

   The tunnel fragmentation and reassembly strategy is therefore as
   follows:

   1.  When the tunnel ingress receives a packet that is no larger than
       (1280-HLEN) bytes, it encapsulates the packet and sends it to the
       egress without fragmentation.  The egress will receive the packet
       since it is small enough to fit within the IPv6 minMTU of 1280
       bytes.

   2.  When the tunnel egress receives a packet that is larger than 1500
       bytes, it encapsulates the packet and sends it to the egress
       without fragmentation.  If the packet is lost in the network due
       to a size restriction, the ingress may or may not reeceive a PTB
       message which it can then forward to the original soruce.
       Whether or not a PTB message is received, however, it is the
       responsibility of the original source to ensure that its packets

       larger than 1500 bytes are making it to the final destination by
       using a path probing technique such as specified by [RFC4821].

   3.  When the tunnel ingress receives a packet larger than (1280 -
       HLEN) but no larger than 1500 bytes, and it is not yet known
       whether packets of this size can reach the egress without
       fragmentation, the ingress encapsulates the packet and uses
       network layer fragmentation to fragment it into two pieces that
       are each signifiicantly smaller than (1280 - HLEN) bytes.  At the
       same time, the tunnel ingress sends an unfragmented 1500 byte
       probe packet toward the egress (subject to rate limiting) which
       will appear as (1500 + HLEN) bytes on the wire.  If the egress
       receives the probe, it informs the ingress that the probe
       succeeded.  If the probe succeeds, the ingress can suspend the
       fragmentation process and send packets between (1280-HLEN) and
       1500 bytes without using fragmentation.  This probing process
       exactly parallels [RFC4821].

   In this method, the tunnel egress must configure a slightly larger
   MRU than the minMRU specified for IPv6 in order to accommodate the
   HLEN bytes of tunnel encapsulation during reassembly. 2KB is
   recommended as the minMRU for this reason.

   These procedures give way to the ability for the tunnel ingress to
   configure an unlimited MTU (theoretical limit is 2^16 bytes for IPv4
   and 2^32 bytes for IPv6).  They will therefore naturally lead to the
   Internet migrating to larger packet sizes with no dependence on
   traditional path MTU discovery.  Operators will also soon discover
   that configuring larger MTUs on links between routers (e.g., 2KB or
   larger) will dampen the fragmentation and reassembly requirements
   until fragmentation and reassembly usage is gradually tuned out of
   the network.

   These procedures are not supported by the existing IPv6 fragmentation
   procedures, however they are exactly those specified in the
   Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL)
   [I-D.templin-intarea-seal].  Widespread adoption of SEAL will
   therefore naturally lead to an Internet which no longer places MTU
   restrictions on tunnels and therefore supports natural migration to
   unbounded packet sizes.
