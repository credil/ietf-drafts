"Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)" [1] requires a set of
procedures for augmenting network layer packets with "label stacks",
thereby turning them into "labeled packets".  Routers which support
MPLS are known as "Label Switching Routers", or "LSRs".  In order to
transmit a labeled packet on a particular data link, an LSR must
support an encoding technique which, given a label stack and a
network layer packet, produces a labeled packet.  This document
specifies the encoding to be used by an LSR in order to transmit
labeled packets on Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) data links, on LAN
data links, and possibly on other data links as well.  On some data
links, the label at the top of the stack may be encoded in a different
manner, but the techniques described here MUST be used to encode the
remainder of the label stack.  This document also specifies rules and
procedures for processing the various fields of the label stack
encoding.

This document is a product of the Multiprotocol Label Switching
Working Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
