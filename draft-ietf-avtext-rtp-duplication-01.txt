                        Duplicating RTP Streams
                  draft-ietf-avtext-rtp-duplication-01

Abstract

   Packet loss is undesirable for real-time multimedia sessions, but can
   occur due to congestion, or other unplanned network outages.  This is
   especially true for IP multicast networks, where packet loss patterns
   can vary greatly between receivers.  One technique that can be used
   to recover from packet loss without incurring unbounded delay for all
   the receivers is to duplicate the packets and send them in separate
   redundant streams.  This document explains how Real-time Transport
   Protocol (RTP) streams can be duplicated without breaking RTP media
   streams, or RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) rules.

Internet-Draft               RTP Duplication               December 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] is widely used today
   for delivering IPTV traffic, and other real-time multimedia sessions.
   Many of these applications support very large numbers of receivers,
   and rely on intra-domain UDP/IP multicast for efficient distribution
   of traffic within the network.

   While this combination has proved successful, there does exist a
   weakness.  As [RFC2354] noted, packet loss is not avoidable, even in
   a carefully managed network.  This loss might be due to congestion,
   it might also be a result of an unplanned outage caused by a flapping
   link, link or interface failure, a software bug, or a maintenance
   person accidentally cutting the wrong fiber.  Since UDP/IP flows do
   not provide any means for detecting loss and retransmitting packets,
   it leaves up to the RTP layer and the applications to detect, and
   recover from, packet loss.

   One technique to recover from packet loss without incurring unbounded
   delay for all the receivers is to duplicate the packets and send them
   in separate redundant streams.  Variations on this idea have been
   implemented and deployed today [IC2011].  However, duplication of RTP
   streams without breaking the RTP and RTCP functionality has not been
   documented properly.  This document explains how duplication can be
   achieved for RTP streams.

   Stream duplication offers a simple way to protect media flows from
   packet loss.  It has a comparatively high bandwidth overhead, since
   everything is sent twice, but with a low processor overhead.  It is
   also very predictable in its overheads.  Alternative approaches may
   be suitable in some cases, for example retransmission-based recovery
   [RFC4588] or forward error correction [RFC5109].


2.  Terminology and Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


3.  Dual Streaming Use Cases

   Dual streaming refers to a technique that involves transmitting two
   redundant RTP streams of the same content, with each stream capable
   of supporting the playback when there is no packet loss.  Therefore,
   adding an additional RTP stream provides a protection against packet



Begen & Perkins           Expires July 3, 2013                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               RTP Duplication               December 2012


   loss.  The level of protection depends on how the packets are sent
   and transmitted inside the network.

   It is important to note that dual streaming can easily be extended to
   support cases when more than two streams are desired.  However, using
   three or more streams is rare in practise, due to the high overhead
   that it incurs.

3.1.  Temporal Redundancy

   From a routing perspective, two streams are considered identical if
   the following two IP header fields are the same, since they will be
   both routed over the same path:

   o  IP Source Address

   o  IP Destination Address

   Two routing-plane identical RTP streams might carry the same payload,
   but can use different Synchronization Sources (SSRC) to differentiate
   the RTP packets belonging to each stream.  In the context of dual RTP
   streaming, we assume that the source duplicates the RTP packets and
   sends them in separate RTP streams, each with a unique SSRC.  All the
   redundant streams are transmitted in the same RTP session.

   For example, one main and one redundant RTP stream can be sent to the
   same IP destination address and UDP destination port with a certain
   delay between them [I-D.ietf-mmusic-delayed-duplication].  The
   streams carry the same payload in their respective RTP packets with
   identical sequence numbers.  This allows receivers (or other nodes
   responsible for gap filling and duplicate suppression) to identify
   and suppress the duplicate packets, and subsequently produce a
   hopefully loss-free and duplication-free output stream.  This process
   is called stream merging.

3.2.  Spatial Redundancy

   An RTP source might be associated with multiple network interfaces,
   allowing it to send two redundant streams from two separate source
   addresses.  Such streams can be routed over diverse or identical
   paths depending on the routing algorithm used inside the network.  At
   the receiving end, the node responsible for duplicate suppression can
   look into various RTP header fields, for example SSRC and sequence
   number, to identify and suppress the duplicate packets.

   If source-specific multicast (SSM) transport is used to carry such
   redundant streams, there will be a separate SSM session for each
   redundant stream since the streams are sourced from different



Begen & Perkins           Expires July 3, 2013                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               RTP Duplication               December 2012


   interfaces (i.e., IP addresses).  Thus, the receiving host has to
   join each SSM session separately.

   Alternatively, an RTP source might send the redundant streams to
   separate IP destination addresses.

3.3.  Dual Streaming over a Single Path or Multiple Paths

   Having described the characteristics of the streams, one can reach
   the following conclusions:

   1.  When two routing-plane identical streams are used, the two
       streams will have identical IP headers.  This makes it
       impractical to forward the packets onto different paths.  In
       order to minimize packet loss, the packets belonging to one
       stream are often interleaved with packets belonging to the other,
       and with a delay, so that if there is a packet loss, such a delay
       would allow the same packet from the other stream to reach the
       receiver because the chances that the same packet is lost in
       transit again is often small.  This is what is also known as
       Time-shifted Redundancy, Temporal Redundancy or simply Delayed
       Duplication [I-D.ietf-mmusic-delayed-duplication] [IC2011].  This
       approach can be used with both types of dual streaming, described
       in Section 3.1 and Section 3.2.

   2.  If the two streams have different IP headers, an additional
       opportunity arises in that one is able to build a network, with
       physically diverse paths, to deliver the two streams concurrently
       to the intended receivers.  This reduces the delay when packet
       loss occurs and needs to be recovered.  Additionally, it also
       further reduces chances for packet loss.  An unrecoverable loss
       happens only when two network failures happen in such a way that
       the same packet is affected on both paths.  This is referred to
       as Spatial Diversity or Spatial Redundancy [IC2011].  The
       techniques used to build diverse paths are beyond the scope of
       this document.

       Note that spatial redundancy often offers less delay in
       recovering from packet loss provided that the forwarding delay of
       the network paths are more or less the same.  For both temporal
       and spatial redundancy approaches, packet misordering might still
       happen and needs to be handled using the sequence numbers of some
       sort (e.g., RTP sequence numbers).

   To summarize, dual streaming allows an application and a network to
   work together to provide a near zero-loss transport with a bounded or
   minimum delay.  The additional advantage includes a predictable
   bandwidth overhead that is proportional to the minimum bandwidth

   needed for the multimedia session, but independent of the number of
   receivers experiencing a packet loss and requesting a retransmission.
   For a survey and comparison of similar approaches, refer to [IC2011].


4.  Use of RTP and RTCP with Temporal Redundancy

   To achieve temporal redundancy, the main and redundant RTP streams
   MUST be sent using the same 5-tuple of transport protocol, source and
   destination IP addresses, and source and destination transport ports.
   This is perhaps overly restrictive, but with the possible presence of
   network address and port translation (NAPT) devices, using anything
   other than an identical 5-tuple can also cause spatial redundancy.

   Since main and redundant RTP streams follow an identical path, they
   are part of the same RTP session.  Accordingly, the sender MUST
   choose a different SSRC for the redundant RTP stream than it chose
   for the main RTP stream, following the rules in [RFC3550] Section 8.

4.1.  RTCP Considerations

   If RTCP is being sent for the main RTP stream, then the sender MUST
   also generate RTCP for the redundant RTP stream.  The RTCP for the
   redundant RTP stream is generated exactly as-if the redundant RTP
   stream were a regular media stream.  The sender MUST NOT duplicate
   the RTCP packets sent for the main RTP stream when sending the
   duplicate stream, instead it MUST generate new RTCP reports for the
   duplicate stream.  The sender MUST use the same RTCP CNAME in the
   RTCP reports it sends for the main and redundant streams, so that the
   receiver can synchronize them.

   Both the main and redundant RTP streams, and their corresponding RTCP
   reports, will be received.  If RTCP is used, receivers MUST generate
   RTCP reports for both main and redundant streams in the usual way,
   treating them as entirely separate media streams.

4.2.  Signaling Considerations

   Signaling is needed to allow the receiver to determine that an RTP
   stream is a redundant copy of another, rather than a separate stream
   that needs to be rendered in parallel.  There are two parts to this:
   an SDP extension is needed in the offer/answer exchange to negotiate
   support for temporal redundancy; and signaling is needed to indicate
   which stream is the duplicate (the latter can be done in-band using
   an RTCP extension, or out-of-band by signaling the SSRCs used by the
   duplicate streams in SDP).

   We require out-of-band signaling for both features.  The required SDP

Internet-Draft               RTP Duplication               December 2012


   attribute to signal duplication in the SDP offer/answer exchange
   ('duplication-delay') is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-delayed-duplication].  The required SDP grouping
   semantics are defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-duplication-grouping].

   In the following SDP example, a video stream is duplicated, and the
   main and redundant streams are transmitted in two separate SSRCs
   (1000 and 1010):

        v=0
        o=ali 1122334455 1122334466 IN IP4 dup.example.com
        s=Delayed Duplication
        t=0 0
        m=video 30000 RTP/AVP 100
        c=IN IP4 233.252.0.1/127
        a=source-filter:incl IN IP4 233.252.0.1 198.51.100.1
        a=rtpmap:100 MP2T/90000
        a=ssrc:1000 cname:ch1@example.com
        a=ssrc:1010 cname:ch1@example.com
        a=ssrc-group:DUP 1000 1010
        a=duplication-delay:100
        a=mid:Group1

   It is RECOMMENDED that the SSRC listed first in the "a=ssrc-group:"
   line is sent first, with the other RTP SSRC being the time-delayed
   duplicate.  This is not critical, however, and receivers should size
   their playout buffers based on the "a=duplication-delay:" attribute,
   and play the stream that arrives first in preference, with the other
   stream acting as a repair stream, irrespective of the order in which
   they are signalled.


5.  Use of RTP and RTCP with Spatial Redundancy

   When using spatial redundancy, the redundant RTP stream is sent on
   using a different source and/or destination address/port pair.  This
   will be a separate RTP session to the session conveying the main RTP
   stream.

   The SSRCs used for the main and redundant streams MUST be chosen
   randomly, following the rules in Section 8 of [RFC3550].
   Accordingly, they will almost certainly not match each other.  The
   sender MUST, however, use the same RTCP CNAME for both the main and
   redundant streams, and MUST include an "a=ssrc:... srcname:..."
   attribute to correlate the flows.  An "a=group:DUP" attribute is used
   to indicate duplication.

5.1.  RTCP Considerations

   If RTCP is being sent for the main RTP stream, then the sender MUST
   also generate RTCP for the redundant RTP stream.  The RTCP for the
   redundant RTP stream is generated exactly as-if the redundant RTP
   stream were a regular media stream; the sender MUST NOT duplicate the
   RTCP packets sent for the main RTP stream.  The sender MUST use the
   same RTCP CNAME in the RTCP reports it sends for the main and
   redundant streams, so that the receiver can synchronize them.

   The main and redundant streams are conceptually synchronised using
   the standard RTCP SR-based mechanism, deriving a mapping between
   their timelines.  The RTP timestamps and sequence numbers SHOULD be
   identical in the main and redundant streams, however, making the
   mapping trivial in most cases.

   Both main and redundant streams, and their corresponding RTCP, will
   be received.  If RTCP is used, receivers MUST generate RTCP reports
   for both main and redundant streams in the usual way, treating them
   as entirely separate media streams.

5.2.  Signaling Considerations

   The required SDP grouping semantics have been defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-duplication-grouping].  In the following example,
   the redundant streams have different IP destination addresses.  The
   example shows the same UDP port number and IP source addresses, but
   either or both could have been different for the two streams.

        a=mid:S1b


6.  Use of RTP and RTCP with Temporal and Spatial Redundancy

   This uses the same RTP/RTCP mechanisms, plus a combination of both
   sets of signaling.


7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC3550],
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-delayed-duplication], and
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-duplication-grouping] apply.

   If stream de-duplication is done by an in-network middlebox, rather
   than by an end system, that middlebox can work if Secure RTP (SRTP)
   encryption is used [RFC3711], since the RTP headers are in the clear.
   Doing so would break the authentication when the SSRC is rewritten,
   unless the de-duplication middlebox were trusted to re-authenticate
   the packets.  This would require additional signaling which is not
   specified here, since de-duplication in the receiver end system is
   expected to be the more common use case.


8.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA actions are required.
