 OSPF Version 2 as the Customer Edge/Customer Protocol for BGP/MPLS IP
                                  VPNs
                 draft-freedman-l3vpn-ospf2-4364-ce-01

Abstract

   RFC4577 (OSPF as the Provider/Customer Edge Protocol for BGP/MPLS IP
   VPNs) proposes a mechanism for the use of the Open Shortest Path
   First V2 ("OSPF", RFC2328) protocol between the Provider Edge ("PE")
   and Customer Edge ("CE") routers within a BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private
   Network ("IPVPN", RFC4364).

   The standard provides for use of such a provider VPN to join
   discontiguous locations together, preserving the OSPF area and domain
   behaviour.

   This document describes a technique for utilising the same, IPVPN
   network infrastructure without the requirement to enable the OSPF
   protocol on the PE/CE interface and thus relieve the PE router of
   OSPF duties.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC4577] describes a mechanism whereby discontiguous locations
   belonging to the same OSPF area and domain are connected by use of an
   [RFC4364] IPVPN network.

   The premise (see Figure 1) is that OSPF [RFC2328] routing information
   from a site is learned by the attached PE router through an OSPF
   adjacency with the site's CE router.  This OSPF routing information
   is learned in the context of a Virtual Routing and Forwarding ("VRF")
   instance intended to trigger redistribution into the provider BGP as
   a VPN-IPv4 route through the addition of various Extended Communities
   [RFC4360] such as "Route Target" (to select the desired destination
   VRFs when imported by other PE routers), "OSPF Domain Identifier" (to
   determine if the route should be treated as internal or external to
   the CE OSPF domain) and "OSPF Route Type" (to encode the LSA type as
   it was received from the OSPF neighbor).

   When a remote PE router, importing such routes into a VRF (due to a
   matching Route-Target in a VRF import policy), locates the OSPF
   extended communities, it uses them to originate OSPF LSAs to its
   attached CE.  Providing the OSPF domain ID is the same, BGP routes
   can be redistributed back into the CE-attached OSPF area using the
   information encoded in the BGP update, fooling the attached site into
   thinking that there is a contiguous OSPF domain.

   "Sham Links" may then be created between VPN residing endpoints on
   all involved PE routers, to provide simulated intra-area links,
   ensuring that any "Backdoor" links between C routers are not
   automatically selected by OSPF in preference to the provider network
   links (which would normally be treated as inter-area had the Sham
   Link not been present).

2.  Problem Statement

   The author infers from the title and language in RFC4577 that the
   original intention of the document was to provide OSPF functionality
   over an IPVPN network through use of the Provider's PE routers.
   Since the Provider may use the PE router for multiple customers, and
   OSPF is based on repeated execution of the Shortest Path First
   ("SPF") algorithm, this approach may create computation scaling
   considerations for the PE as the number or complexity of customer
   topologies using this technology on the PE increases.

3.  Solution Statement

   This document proposes a mechanism for providing this OSPF
   functionality over IPVPN networks, using only CE routers in a single
   OSPF domain.  A CE router that performs this function is to be known
   as an O-CE router.  Only IP and BGP are therefore required between
   the O-CE and PE, this is illustrated below in Figure 2

                                   ,-----.
                             [PE1]; IPVPN +[PE2]
                               |  :       +  |
                         BGP   |   `-----'   |   BGP

                        OSPF   |    Area 0   |   OSPF
                             [ C1]         [C3 ]
                    OSPF     ,-'             `.     OSPF
                          [ C2]              [C4 ]
                            \__________________/
                                Backdoor Link

                                 Figure 2

   By removing the OSPF from the PE router and placing the
   responsibility on the O-CE, the provider's existing IPVPN PE routers
   are no longer forced to run the SPF algorithm since this task can be
   delegated to the O-CE which does not have the same scaling concerns
   (it does not share this task with multiple customer domains).

4.  Domains

   An O-CE is intended to only operate in one OSPF domain, known as the
   O-CD (O-CE Domain).  Though the O-CD is intended to be operator
   configured on the O-CE, it may instead be automatically discovered
   (but such mechanisms are outside the scope of this document).  It is
   assumed that the reachability signalled in the O-CD reflects the
   reachability inside the corresponding attached provider VRF.

   An O-CE receiving reachability information via BGP from the IPVPN
   network from the provider VRF should interact with the C router
   domain with respect to the O-CD in line with [RFC4577] Section 4.1.
   In these cases, the O-CE MAY choose to accept reachability concerning
   a domain other than the O-CD, in such case the O-CE must flood this
   information as extra-area (type 5/7).

5.  Sham Links

   RFC4577 makes the following requirement of creating Sham Links (Sec
   4.2.7.3):

   An OSPF protocol packet is regarded as having been received on a
   particular Sham Link if and only if the following three conditions
   hold:

      -  The packet arrives as an MPLS packet, and its MPLS label stack
         causes it to be "delivered" to the local Sham Link endpoint
         address.

      -  The packet's IP destination address is the local Sham Link
         endpoint address.

      -  The packet's IP source address is the remote Sham Link endpoint
         address.

   Although RFC4577 marks the use of Sham Links as "OPTIONAL", creation
   of such links, with respect to the above stated, require that the
   implementation transmit the OSPF protocol packets over MPLS
   transport.

   Since the intention of this document is to ensure that only IP and
   BGP are required between O-CE routers, this document relaxes the
   requirements stated in this RFC section, by removing the requirement
   for the packet to arrive as an MPLS packet.  Since the routing
   information is redistributed into the BGP and labelled by the PE
   router for use within the Provider's IPVPN network, an additional
   MPLS LSP is not required.

   This document adds the requirement that BGP should be used as a PE/
   O-CE protocol and that Extended Communities be made available to both
   peers through mutual negotiation of the relevant BGP capability
   [RFC3392].

6.  Behavioral Considerations

   This document makes the following summary recommendations in respect
   to behavior:

   1.  That the requirement stated in Section 3 (Requirements) of
       RFC4577, that OSPF is used as a PE/CE routing protocol be
       relaxed, such that BGP is used as a PE/O-CE routing protocol and
       that BGP extended communities are enabled between PE and O-CE.  A
       mechanism to filter said communities SHOULD be made available to
       the operator to ensure that no other (unwanted) extended
       communities are injected to or from the provider space.

   2.  That the requirement stated in Section 4.2.7.3 (OSPF Protocol on
       Sham Links) of RFC4577 with regards to the requirement that the
       OSPF protocol packet be received as an MPLS packet, be relaxed in
       an O-CE router implementation.  In its place, the O-CE router
       MUST verify that the OSPF protocol packet is valid based on the
       operator configuration of valid Sham Link endpoints.

7.  Security Considerations

   The Behavioral Considerations (Section 6) specify that particular
   behavioral patterns of RFC4577 be relaxed, references to ensuring
   appropriate security of these modified behaviors can be found here.

   It is important to note that the O-CE operates only in the context of
   the O-CD, this means that the RFC4577 requirements supporting
   multiple domain/instance behaviors are not relevant in the scope of
   the O-CE.
