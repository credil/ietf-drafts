Abstract 

   IPv6 Rapid Deployment (6rd) provides both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity 
   services simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 co-existing period. The 
   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 6rd option has been 
   defined to configure 6rd Customer Edge (CE). However, in many 
   networks, the configuration information may be stored in 
   Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers while user 
   configuration is mainly from Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) through 
   DHCP protocol. This document defines a Remote Authentication Dial In 
   User Service (RADIUS) attribute that carries 6rd configuration 
   information from AAA server to BNG.

1. Introduction 

   Recently providers have started to deploy IPv6 and consider how to 
   transit to IPv6. IPv6 Rapid Deployment (6rd) [RFC5969] provides both 
   IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity services simultaneously during the 
   IPv4/IPv6 co-existing period. 6rd is used to provide IPv6 
   connectivity service through legacy IPv4-only infrastructure. 6rd 
   adopts Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [RFC2131] as auto-
   configuring protocol. The 6rd Customer Edge (CE) uses the DHCP 6rd 
   option [RFC5969] to discover 6rd border relay and to configure IPv6 
   prefix and address. 

   In many networks, user configuration information is managed by AAA 
   (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) servers. The Remote 
   Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) protocol [RFC2865] is 
   usually used by AAA servers to communicate with network elements. In 
   a fixed line broadband network, the Broadband Network Gateways (BNGs) 
   act as the access gateway of users. The BNGs are assumed to embed a 
   DHCP server function that allows them to locally handle any DHCP 
   requests issued by hosts. 

   Since the 6rd configuration information is stored in AAA servers and 
   user configuration is mainly through DHCP protocol between BNGs and 
   hosts/CEs, new RADIUS attributes are needed to propagate the 
   information from AAA servers to BNGs. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

   The terms 6rd Customer Edge (6rd CE) and 6rd Border Relay (BR) are 
   defined in [RFC5969]. 

3. IPv6 6rd Configuration with RADIUS 

   The below Figure 1 illustrates how the RADIUS protocol and DHCP 
   cooperate to provide 6rd CE with 6rd configuration information.

                   DHCP                         RADIUS  
             Figure 1: the cooperation between DHCP and RADIUS 
                       combining with RADIUS authentication 

   The BNG acts as a client of RADIUS and as a DHCP server for DHCP 
   protocol. First, the 6rd CE initiates a DHCPDISCOVER message that 
   includes a Parameter Request option (55) [RFC2132] with 6rd option 
   [RFC5969]. When the BNG receives the DHCPDISCOVER, it initiates a 
   Radius Access-Request message to the Radius server, requesting normal 
   authentication as defined in [RFC2865] and IPv6-6rd-Configuration 
   attribute, defined in the next Section, in the desired attribute  
   list. If the authentication request is approved by the AAA server, an 
   Access-Accept message is acknowledged with the IPv6-6rd-Configuration 
   Attribute. Then, the BNG responds to the 6rd CE with a DHCPOFFER 
   message, which contains DHCP 6rd option. 

   Figure 2 describes another scenario - later re-authorize, in which 
   the authorization operation is not coupled with authentication. 6rd 
   relevant authorization is done independently after the authentication 
   process.

   In the abovementioned scenario, the Access-Request packet contains a 
   Service-Type attribute with the value Authorize Only (17); thus, 
   according to [RFC5080], the Access-Request packet MUST contain a 
   State attribute that succeeds from the previous authentication 
   process. 

   In both abovementioned scenarios, after receiving the IPv6-6rd-
   Configuration Attribute in the initial Access-Accept, the BNG MUST 
   store the received 6rd configuration parameters locally. When the 6rd 
   CE sends a DHCP Request message to request an extension of the 
   lifetime for the assigned address, the BNG does not have to initiate 
   a new Access-Request towards the AAA server to request the 6rd 
   configuration parameters. The BNG retrieves the previously stored 6rd 
   configuration parameters and use them in its reply. 

   If the BNG does not receive the IPv6-6rd-Configuration Attribute in 
   the Access-Accept it MAY fallback to a pre-configured default 6rd 
   configuration, if any. If the BNG does not have any pre-configured 
   default 6rd configuration or if the BNG receives an Access-Reject, 
   the tunnel cannot be established. 

   As specified in [RFC2131, section 4.4.5, "Reacquisition and 
   expiration", if the DHCP server to which the DHCP Request message was 
   sent at time T1 has not responded by time T2 (typically 
   0.375*duration_of_lease after T1), the 6rd CE (the DHCP client) 
   enters the REBINDING state and attempts to contact any server.  In 
   this situation, the secondary BNG receiving the new DHCP message MUST 
   initiate a new Access-Request towards the AAA server. The secondary 
   BNG MAY include the IPv6-6rd-Configuration Attribute in its Access-
   Request. 

4. Attributes 

   This section defines IPv6-6rd-Configuration Attribute which is used 
   in the both abovementioned scenarios. The attribute design follows 
   [RFC6158]. 

4.1. IPv6-6rd-Configuration Attribute 

   The IPv6-6rd-Configuration Attribute is structured as follows (The 
   specification requires that multiple IPv4 addresses are associated 
   strongly with one IPv6 prefix. Given that RADIUS currently has no 
   recommended way of grouping multiple attributes, the below design 
   appears to be a reasonable compromise.):

   The IPv6-6rd-Configuration Attribute is normally used in the  
   Access-Accept messages. It MAY be used in Access-Request packets as a 
   hint to the RADIUS server; for example if the BNG is pre-configured 
   with a default 6rd configuration, these parameters MAY be inserted in 
   the attribute. The RADIUS server MAY ignore the hint sent by the BNG 
   and it MAY assign different 6rd parameters. 

   If the BNG includes the IPv6-6rd-Configuration Attribute, but the AAA 
   server does not recognize it, this attribute MUST be ignored by the 
   AAA Server. 

   If the BNG does not receive IPv6-6rd-Configuration Attribute in the 
   Access-Accept it MAY fallback to a pre-configured default 6rd 
   configuration, if any. If the BNG does not have any pre-configured 
   default 6rd configuration, the 6rd tunnel cannot be established. 

   If the BNG is pre-provisioned with a default 6rd configuration and 
   the 6rd configuration received in Access-Accept is different from the 
   configured default, then the 6rd configuration received in the 
   Access-Accept message MUST be used for the session. 

   If the BNG cannot support the received 6rd configuration for any 
   reason, the tunnel SHOULD NOT be established. 

4.2. Table of attributes 

   The following table adds to the one in [RFC2865], Section 5.44, 
   providing a guide to the quantity of IPv6-6rd-Configuration 
   attributes that may be found in each kind of packet.

   The following table defines the meanings of the above table entries. 

   0     This attribute MUST NOT be present in packet. 
   0+    Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be present in 
         packet. 
   0-1   Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be present in 
         packet. 
   1     Exactly one instance of this attribute MUST be present in 
         packet.

5. Diameter Considerations 

   This attribute is usable within either RADIUS or Diameter [RFC6733]. 
   Since the Attributes defined in this document will be allocated from 
   the standard RADIUS type space, no special handling is required by 
   Diameter entities. 

6. Security Considerations 

   In 6rd scenarios, both CE and BNG are within a provider network, 
   which can be considered as a close and less security threat 
   environment. The similar consideration can be applied to the Radius 
   message exchanging between BNG and the AAA server. 

   In 6rd scenarios, the RADIUS protocol is run over IPv4. Known 
   security vulnerabilities of the RADIUS protocol are discussed in 
   [RFC2607], [RFC2865], and [RFC2869]. Use of IPsec [RFC4301] for 
   providing security when RADIUS is carried in IPv6 is discussed in 
   [RFC3162]. 

   Security considerations for the Diameter protocol are discussed in 
   [RFC6733]. 

7. IANA Considerations 

   This document requires the assignment of one new RADIUS Attribute 
   Types in the "Radius Types" registry (currently located at 
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types for the following 
   attributes: 

      o  IPv6-6rd-Configuration 

   IANA should allocate the number from the standard RADIUS Attributes 
   range (values 1-191).  The RFC Editor should use the assigned value 
   to replace "TBD" in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, and should remove this 
   paragraph.
