1.  Introduction

1.1.  Packet One Way Delay Metrics Block

   [I-D.ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-delay] defines the new block type
   supporting the reporting of the mean, minimum and maximum values of
   the network round-trip delay between media source(source) and media
   receiver(destination).  However none of these metrics allow a
   receiver to report one way delay from source to destination or from
   destination to source.  As described in [RFC2679], the path from a
   source to a destination may be different than the path from the
   destination back to the source.  Even when the two paths are
   symmetric, they may have radically different performance
   characteristics.  Therefore the measurement of one-way delay can not
   be roughly estimated by the round-trip delay for many applications in
   the asymmetric network.

   This draft defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611] for use in a range of RTP applications.  The new block type
   supports the reporting of the mean, minimum, maximum values of one
   way delay between RTP interfaces in peer RTP end systems, as well as
   the percentile and inverse-percentile (regarding a threshold value),
   already defined in RFC 2679, as measured, for example, using the RTCP
   method described in [RFC3550].

   This metrics belong to the class of transport metrics defined in
   [MONARCH] (work in progress).

1.2.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]
   defined an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This draft defines a new Extended Report block that
   MUST be used as defined in [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].

1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework

   The Performance Metrics Framework [PMOLFRAME] provides guidance on
   the definition and specification of performance metrics.  Metrics
   described in this draft either reference external definitions or
   define metrics generally in accordance with the guidelines in
   [PMOLFRAME].

1.4.  Applicability

   These metrics are applicable to a range of delay-sensitive RTP
   applications in which this report block would be useful, such as some
   IDMS use cases (e.g., video wall, network games, networked

3.2.  Definition of Fields in One Way Delay Metrics Report Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      A One way Delay Report Block is identified by the constant NOWDEL.

      [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NOWDEL with the IANA provided
      RTCP XR block type for this block.]


   Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bit

      This field is used to indicate whether the QoE Metrics are
      Sampled, Interval or Cumulative metrics [MONARCH], that is,
      whether the reported values applies to the most recent measurement
      interval duration between successive metrics reports (I=10) (the
      Interval Duration), to the accumulation period characteristic of
      cumulative measurements (I=11) (the Cumulative Duration) or is a
      sampled instantaneous value (I=01).

Internet-Draft                RTCP XR Delay                 January 2012


   Reserved (resv): 6 bits

      These bits are reserved.  They SHOULD be set to zero by senders
      and MUST be ignored by receivers.


   block length: 16 bits

      The length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one.  For
      the Delay block, the block length is equal to 6.


   SSRC of source: 32 bits

      The SSRC of the media source shall be set to the value of the SSRC
      identifier carried in the RTP header [RFC3550] of the RTP packet
      to which the XR relates.


   Time Duration Threshold: 32 bits

      This field is associated with the one-way-delay-percentile and
      one-way-delay-inver-percentile and expressed in Milliseconds or
      microseconds depending on which clock source is used and the
      requirement for synchronization accuracy (see section 4).


   One-way-Delay-Percentile: 16 bits

      The percentages of packets in the RTP stream for which individual
      packet one way delays were less than the Threshold.


   One-way-Delay-Inver-Percentile: 16 bits

      The percentages of packets in the RTP stream for which individual
      packet one way delays were more than the Threshold.

   One-way-Delay-Median: 32 bits

      The Mean One way Delay is the mean value of the RTP-to- RTP
      interface one way delay in ms or us over the measurement period,
      typically determined using RTCP SR/RR.  This value is generated
      according to section 3.6 of [RFC2679].

Internet-Draft                RTCP XR Delay                 January 2012


   Max-One-way-Delay: 32 bits

      The Max One Way Delay is the maximum value of the RTP- to-RTP
      interface one way delay in ms or us over the measurement period,
      typically determined using RTCP SR/RR.  This value is generated
      according to section 3.6 of [RFC2679].


   Min-One-way-Delay: 32 bits

      The Max One Way Delay is the minimum value of the RTP- to-RTP
      interface one way delay in ms or us over the measurement period,
      typically determined using RTCP SR/RR.  This value is generated
      according to section 3.6 of [RFC2679].

4.  Clock synchronization for one way delay metrics

   This subsection provides informative guidance on use of methodology
   for one way delay metrics measurement.

   As specified in the methodology of [RFC2679], it is important for
   media source (Src) and media receiver (Dst) to synchronize very
   closely since one way delay values will often be as low as the 100
   usec to 10 msec range.  In order to arrange Src and Des synchronized
   before measurement method is applied, clock synchronization SDP
   attribute defined in [I-D.brandenburg-mmusic-clock-synchronization],
   [IDMS] is used to signal the clock synchronization source or sources
   used or able to be used.  A participant at the Dst can indicate which
   synchronization source is being used at the moment.  A participant
   can also indicate any other synchronization sources available to it.
   This allows multiple participants in an RTP session to use the same
   or a similar clock synchronization source for their session.

5.  SDP Signaling

   [RFC3611] defines the use of SDP (Session Description Protocol)
   [RFC4566] for signaling the use of XR blocks.  XR blocks MAY be used
   without prior signaling.

   This section augments the SDP [RFC4566] attribute "rtcp-xr" defined
   in [RFC3611] by providing an additional value of "xr-format" to
   signal the use of the report block defined in this document.

   rtcp-xr-attrib = "a=" "rtcp-xr" ":" [xr-format *(SP xr-format)] CRLF

   (defined in [RFC3611])

   xr-format =/ xr-one-way-delay-block

   xr-one-way-delay-block ="one way delay"

6.  IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.  For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to
   [RFC3611].

6.1.  New RTCP XR Block Type value

   This document assigns the block type value NOWDEL in the IANA "RTCP
   XR Block Type Registry" to the "One Way Delay Metrics Block".

   [Note to RFC Editor: please replace NOWDEL with the IANA provided
   RTCP XR block type for this block.]

6.2.  New RTCP XR SDP Parameter

   This document also registers a new parameter "one way delay" in the
   "RTCP XR SDP Parameters Registry".

6.3.  Contact information for registrations


      The contact information for the registrations is:

7.  Security Considerations

   It is believed that this proposed RTCP XR report block introduces no
   new security considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611].
   This block does not provide per-packet statistics so the risk to
   confidentiality documented in Section 7, paragraph 3 of [RFC3611]
   does not apply.
