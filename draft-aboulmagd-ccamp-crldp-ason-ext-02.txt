Automatic Switched Optical Network (ASON) is an architecture,
specified by ITU-T Study Group 15, for the introduction of a
control plane for optical networks.  The ASON architecture specifies
a set of reference points that defines the relationship between the
ASON architectural entities.  Signaling over interfaces defined in
those reference points can make use of protocols that are defined
by the IETF in the context of Generalized Multi-Protocol Label
Switching (GMPLS) work.  This document describes Constraint-Based
LSP setup using LDP (CR-LDP) extensions for signaling over the
interfaces defined in the ASON reference points.  The purpose of
the document is to request that the IANA assigns code points
necessary for the CR-LDP extensions.  The protocol specifications
for the use of the CR-LDP extensions are found in ITU-T documents.
