   Coordinated Forwarding and Caching in Information-Centric Networks
           draft-xie-icnrg-coordinated-caching-forwarding-00

Abstract

   Content caching plays an important role in Information-Centric
   Networking (ICN).  Many of current ICN designs adopt a limited, en-
   route hierarchical caching mechanism; additionally, caching and
   forwarding are largely uncoordinated in these designs.  This draft
   describes a coordinated caching and forwarding design to improve
   content access cost and cache miss rate of ICN.

1.  Introduction

   The concept of Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has emerged and
   become a significant part of the world-wide research efforts on
   Future Internet architectures.  The principal paradigm of ICN is
   significantly different from the host-to-host communication model in
   the current Internet architecture.  Instead, ICN focuses on
   information objects, their properties, and receiver interest in the
   network to achieve efficient and reliable distribution of such
   objects.  In ICN, content caching is becoming an inherent capability
   of network elements such as routers.  With routers being able to
   cache contents in ICN, it is likely that not only the content
   distribution costs incurred to the network but also the quality of
   service experienced by end users are significantly improved.

   Without specifying the details of content caching, the existing ICN
   architectures are designed to allow flexible design and
   implementation of new caching schemes.  However, they also pose new
   challenges to caching schemes; in particular, it remains unclear how
   content caching should be provisioned (independently or
   collaboratively), and how it should be implemented efficiently.

   Many of current ICN designs adopt a hierarchical caching mechanism
   allowing only limited collaboration in content caching.  More
   specifically, for a given content, caching in many ICN designs takes
   place only at en-route routers (i.e., routers on the paths between a
   requesting host and one or multiple content origins), and thus forms
   a hierarchical caching mechanism.  An en-route router that has the
   requested content should directly respond with the content from its
   local content cache and suppress further forwarding the request to
   the next router in the routing hierarchy.  For instance, Content-
   Centric Network (CCN) is an example of ICN; CCN adopts a name-based
   routing architecture, advocating a ``host-to-content'' communication
   model which differs from the ``host-to-host'' model in Internet.  In
   CCN, where content comes from is no longer important to the
   requesting host.  Additionally, not only en-route routers but also
   routers in the same administrative domain (particularly those nearby
   en-route routers) could have possibly cached a requested content.
   These observations suggest that collaborative caching beyond the
   current limited hierarchical mechanism is feasible and could be
   beneficial.

   Collaborative caching has drawn much attention and some have become
   commercially successful since more than a decade ago.  This leads us
   to believe that collaborative caching in ICN is a key to success in
   that the network performance could be significantly improved by
   letting routers collaborate with each other.

Internet-Draft     Coordinated Forwarding and Caching      February 2013


   However, collaborative caching in ICN, if not well designed, could
   significantly increase the communication overhead.  For instance,
   control messages exchanged among routers, as an example of such
   overhead, are necessary to enable collaborations.  Such messages
   normally contain information about what contents are stored in a
   particular router; due to the enormously large number of distinct
   contents, such messages could consume a significant portion of the
   network bandwidth.  Additionally, the extra latency of exchanging
   such messages may further slow down the collaborative decision making
   process and thus reduce the effectiveness.  A naive approach to
   collaborative caching is to adopt a broadcast mechanism, i.e., each
   request is forwarded to all routers and only those with the requested
   content respond with the data.  However, such an approach is too
   costly and inefficient.

   A key challenge to collaborative caching in ICN is how to make
   routers know what contents are available from other collaborative
   routers in an economic and efficient manner.  Furthermore, since
   routers have knowledge about such availability information, routers
   should leverage it when making forwarding decisions; namely,
   forwarding and caching could be coordinated and collaborative to
   further optimize the network performance.

   We will go beyond the en-route caching model and propose a novel
   name-based distributed coordinated forwarding and caching design for
   ICN in this draft.


2.  Coordinated Forwarding and Caching

   A content router with coordinated forwarding and caching is
   illustrated in the following figure.  A new component called the
   Availability Info Base (AIB for short), is introduced to coordinate
   forwarding and caching in content routers.  AIB keeps track of
   content availability information.  More specifically, AIB can be
   thought of as a table, where each entry has two columns, Name and
   RouterID, suggesting that a given named content is available from a
   router.  Note that we require that each router in the network should
   have a name and routers' names are propagated through the network via
   intradomain routing protocol such as OSPF.  As a result, routers'
   names are treated in the same way as content names and put in FIB.

   For instance, the following figure shows an example of CCN content
   router architecture with coordinated forwarding and caching.  The
   outbound face to reach Router R3 is face 3, and content /c/d is
   available from R3, as shown in the following figure.

Figure 1: Content router with coordinated forwarding and caching

   Each content router periodically announces the pairwise link cost and
   coordinated forwarding/caching related metrics via OSPF or ISIS
   intradomain routing protocols.  Each router also measures the ranking
   of incoming Interests, namely, examine the received Interests from
   the users, and generates its local ranking sequence of the most
   popular contents.  Each router implements the coordinated forwarding
   and caching mechanism, namely, a distributed mechanism to make joint
   decisions for forwarding and caching.  Additionally, each router
   measures the miss rate of the interests in order to further improve
   the caching/forwarding efficiency.

Internet-Draft     Coordinated Forwarding and Caching      February 2013


   Upon receiving an Interest, a router first checks whether the content
   is available and fresh in its local CS.

   o  If yes, the router responds with the locally cached content.

   o  Otherwise, it looks up the Pending Interest Table (PIT), and
      either this Interest should not be forwarded if it is already
      pending in PIT, or it should be forwarded and PIT be updated
      accordingly.  In the latter case, the router looks up AIB to check
      whether the content is available from other collaborative routers.
      If not, the Interest should be forwarded using the default policy
      in information-centric networks (e.g., look up the outbound face
      in FIB and forward to the designated face; if FIB lookup fails,
      use a broadcast-like approach to forward the Interest).
      Otherwise, the Interest should be forwarded to the designated
      collaborative router.  In order to do so, the router needs to look
      up FIB to determine the outbound face to reach the designated
      router.  Note that most likely retrieving contents from
      collaborative routers within an autonomous system saves a
      noticeable time than getting it from the origin, as the latter
      typically requires traversing multiple autonomous systems and
      multiple interdomain links.


3.  Popularity Ranking Based Coordination

3.1.  Popularity Ranking

   To ease the description, we introduce the following notations.  The
   network consists of N content routers.  Each router i has a local
   Content Store (CS) that can cache up to Ci content objects
   (``contents'' for short).  The maximum size of each content is u.  It
   is a common practice that contents are chunked into pieces.  Suppose
   that each piece fits one cache unit (i.e., the size of each piece is
   no greater than u).  Then, the entire network can cache at most C*u
   of contents, where C = C1 + ... + CN.  Users send requesting packets
   (e.g., Interest packets in CCN).  We use a ranking sequence {r1, r2,
   ..., rC} to denote the most popular C contents, sorted in descending
   order of popularity.  This ranking sequence can be measured in real
   time as routers receive Interests.  All routers may not see the same
   distribution of content popularity, e.g., the ranking sequence {r1,
   r2, ..., rC} measured by different routers have a certain percentage
   of mismatches or shifts, refer to as the popularity inconsistency.

3.2.  Cost-Based Optimal Content Caching

   Each content router keeps track of the most popular C contents.  The
   coordination should be provisioned in such a way that the contents



Xie, et al.              Expires August 22, 2013                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     Coordinated Forwarding and Caching      February 2013


   should be optimally distributed (cached) by the N routers, whose
   sizes are C1, C2, ...,CN, so that the average content access cost can
   be minimized in the network.  We denote by cost_i the cost of
   accessing a given content at router i.  Without loss of generality,
   assume that after sorting, cost_1 <= cost_2 <= ... <= cost_N. Also,
   suppose the ranking sequence is {r1, r2, ...rC} in descending order
   of popularity.  The optimal way to distributing (caching) contents
   (i.e., minimizes the average cost of accessing the most popular C
   contents in the network) is to let the more popular content be cached
   at a place that has a lower cost, i.e., router 1 caches r1, ..., rC1
   , router 2 caches rC1+1, ..., rC1+C2, and so on (see Theorem 1 in
   [1]).

   An example of delay-based cost metric can be defined for CCN as
   follows.  Let I_i denote the average number of interests received by
   router i and d_ij denotes the link cost of nodes i and j (d_ij
   becomes the cost of accessing content from the local Content Store
   when i = j).  Such costs can correspond to either intradomain routing
   weights or other performance-related metrics such as distance and
   latency.  Then, for any cache unit in router i, the average cost of
   accessing this content requested by users is cost_i = (I_1 * d_1i +
   ... + I_N * d_Ni) / (I_1 + ... + I_N).

   There are many ways to obtain the cost information.  For instance,
   with the help of intradomain routing protocol, topological
   information is generally available to each router; each router can
   calculate the average cost for all collaborative routers in the
   network and sort all routers using these values.  For any cache unit
   in router, the average cost of accessing a content requested by users
   is the weighted sum of pair-wise access costs from all routers.
   Access costs can correspond to either intradomain routing weights or
   other performance-related metrics such as distance and latency.
   Then, the optimal solution that minimizes the average cost of
   accessing the most popular contents in the network is to let the more
   popular content be cached at a place that has a lower cost, and the
   less popular contents by the router with a larger cost.  Therefore,
   for any top popular content, each router knows not only which
   contents it should keep in its local Content Store, but also which
   collaborative router it can request this content from, if not locally
   available.  Such availability information for the top popular
   contents is stored in AIB.

3.3.  An Example of Cost-based Optimal Coordination

   The coordinated forwarding and caching design is illustrated using a
   simple example shown in the following figure.  In the example, there
   are three coordinated routers R1, R2 and R3.  These routers can cache
   10 contents in total (the size of these three caches are 3, 4, and 3,



Xie, et al.              Expires August 22, 2013                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     Coordinated Forwarding and Caching      February 2013


   respectively).  The most popular 10 contents measured by these
   routers are consistent.  Suppose cost_i is the average cost of
   accessing this content requested by users for any cache unit in
   router i, and cost_1 >= cost_2 >= cost3.  The most popular 3 contents
   should be cached in router R3, the next 4 contents should be cached
   in R2, and the next 3 contents should be cached in R1.  As shown in
   the figure, for any incoming Interest requesting for the most popular
   contents, AIB tells where it should be forwarded to (the content is
   either available from the router's local CS or other collaborative
   routers).

   Figure 2: A design for coordinated forwarding and caching



4.  Dealing with Inconsistent Popularity Ranking

   In practice, popularity rankings seen by different routers are more
   likely inconsistent.  In such cases, the efficiency of content
   forwarding and caching will be degraded.  We describe a solution that
   leverages the dual-segment caching design to address the inconsistent
   popularity ranking problem.

4.1.  Inconsistent Popularity Ranking

   Inconsistency in popularity ranking happens when the ranking
   sequences of routers are slightly different from each other.
   Therefore, the knowledge of routers about the distribution of
   contents in the caches may be inaccurate.  In this situation, when
   any Interest requesting comes for a content, AIB may tell a wrong
   destination where it should be forwarded to, resulting in cache
   misses and efficiency degradation.

   We illustrate inconsistency in popularity ranking through an example
   shown in the following figure.  In this example, router R2's ranking
   sequence is slightly different from R1's and R3's.  In R2's ranking
   sequence, the positions of content h and f are swapped and content k
   replaces j.  As a result, router R2 caches contents {d, e, h, g};
   however, routers R1 and R3 expect that R2 caches {d, e, f, g}
   instead.  Whenever R1 and R3 forward Interests for content f to R2,

Internet-Draft     Coordinated Forwarding and Caching      February 2013


   such Interests have to be further forwarded towards the origin by R2
   (not shown in the figure).  Similarly, R2 always forwards Interests
   for content f and k to R1, resulting in cache misses and further
   forwarding.

4.2.  Dual-Segment Content Caching

   To address the above problem resulted by inconsistent popularity, a
   dual-segment cache design can be adopted, namely, divide a router's
   Content Store into two segments:

   o  the Advertised Content Store (ACS for short), which is the regular
      collaborative cache that is operated the same way as described in
      the preceding subsection assuming consistent popularity;

   o  the Complementary Content Store (CCS for short), which is the
      cache space used for adapting to the inconsistency of popularity
      distribution.

   The rationale behind this dual-segment design is to leverage CCS to
   absorb contents that are supposed to be store at a router but are
   missing in its ACS due to inconsistent popularity.  Upon receiving an
   Interest, if the requested content is available locally, the router
   directly responds with the data.  Otherwise, if the Interest comes
   from another collaborative router, the router forwards the Interest
   towards the content origin and stores the returned data into its
   Complementary Content Store when the data comes back; if the Interest
   comes from a requesting host directly, the router applies its
   knowledge of popularity-ranking sequence and checks whether the
   ranking of the requesting content is less than the cache capacity; If
   yes, it forwards the Interest to the collaborative router designated
   by the sequence; otherwise, it forwards the Interest towards the
   origin.

4.3.  Adaptive Content Store Division

   The impact of the preceding dual-segment design on the performance of
   coordinated forwarding and caching in content-centric networks could
   be subtle.  On the one hand, a sufficiently large CCS is more
   favorable to adapt to the popularity inconsistency; and on the other
   hand, when the total size of the Content Store is fixed, a smaller
   CCS is more favorable, as the ACS could be larger to store more
   frequently requested contents in the network.  Clearly there exist
   trade-offs when determining their sizes.

   A straightforward solution is fixed division of ACS and CCS, e.g.,
   90% dedicated to ACS and the remaining to CCS.  However, the problem
   of fixed division is one size does not fit all, namely, routers may
   experience different levels of popularity inconsistency, and a fixed
   size may either over-estimate or underestimate the inconsistency
   level, thus resulting an inefficient use of the cache space.

   A distributed, self-adaptive scheme can be designed to address the
   above division problem; specifically, the division of ACS and CCS is
   adjusted based on the dynamics experienced by the content routers.
   The scheme is designed based on cache miss rate as the cache miss
   rate plays an important role in the efficiency of dual-segment
   collaborative caching.  On the one hand, when the miss rate is low,
   it implies a potentially oversized CCS and thus a waste of cache
   space.  On the other hand, when the miss rate is high, then contents
   supposed to be stored in a designated collaborative router are
   actually not stored in it, resulting in additional costs to forward
   Interests to the designated router and then towards the origin.

   Below we describe an example algorithm for adaptively adjust the
   cache division.  Define the Locking Miss Rate (LMR for short) to
   characterize the maximum miss rate (corresponding to a maximum level
   of popularity inconsistency) that a router would like to tolerate.
   Every router distributively adjusts its size of CCS to make its miss
   rate closely approach to LMR.  More specifically, a router starts
   with a pre-configured initial cache division, e.g., 90% for the
   Advertised and 10% for CCS.  It then begins measuring the cache miss
   rate for all Interests received from other collaborative routers.  We
   denote the measured cache miss rate by MR.  The example algorithm is
   as follows:

   o  If MR<=LMR, it is likely that the router experiences less
      popularity inconsistency than expected, we may have an oversized
      CCS, so the size of CCS is halved so that we increase the size of
      ACS to cache more contents in the network.

Internet-Draft     Coordinated Forwarding and Caching      February 2013


   o  If MR>LMR, the popularity inconsistency is likely under-estimated;
      therefore we should reduce the size of ACS to have a larger CCS in
      order for accommodating the inconsistency.  Usually, it will be
      better to reduce the size of ACS linearly comparing with reducing
      the size aggressively.  For example, the size of ACS can be
      reduced to 1/(1+MR) of the orginal ACS size.

4.4.  Example: Dual-Segment Content Store Division

   An example of this design for router R2 in the previous example is
   shown in the following figures.  With the single-segment design,
   content f, which is supposed to be cached in R2, is always missing
   due to the inconsistency of R2's ranking statistics.  However, with
   the dual-segment design, R2 only advertise 3 as its cache size.  As a
   result, an extra cache unit can be used to store the missing content
   f.  Therefore, future Interests requesting for f forwarded from
   routers R1 and R3 can be fulfilled by R2.

5.  Conclusions

   In this draft, we describe a distributed, popularity-guided
   coordinated forwarding and caching design for information-centric
   networks, where we introduce an Availability Information Base to
   allow coordination between forwarding and caching in content routers.
   In order to deal with popularity inconsistency in realistic networks,
   we also describe a self-adaptive dual-segment cache division scheme.
   Simulation-based evaluations demonstrate that by coordinating
   forwarding and caching in ICN, content access cost and cache miss
   rate can be significantly improved.
