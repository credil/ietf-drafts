  Using Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) in Web Real-Time
                        Communications (WebRTC)
                   draft-thomson-mmusic-ice-webrtc-00

Abstract

   Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) has been selected as the
   basis for establishing peer-to-peer UDP flows between Web Real-Time
   Communication (WebRTC) clients.  The risks and complications arising
   from this choice are discussed.

Internet-Draft               ICE for WebRTC                 October 2013


1.  Introduction

   ICE [RFC5245] describes a process whereby peers establish a bi-
   directional UDP flow.  This process has been adopted for use in Web
   Real-Time Communications (WebRTC) for establishing flows to and from
   web browsers ([I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview]).

   Properties of ICE are also critical to the security of WebRTC (see
   Section 4.2.1 of [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security]).

   The design of RFC 5245 does not fully consider the threat models
   enabled by the web environment.  TBC...

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   In cases where normative language needs to be emphasized, this
   document falls back on established shorthands for expressing
   interoperability requirements on implementations: the capitalized
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD" and "MAY".  The meaning of these
   is described in [RFC2119].


2.  ICE in a Web Browser

   Details coming...


3.  Modified ICE Algorithm

   Details coming...


4.  Security Considerations

   This entire document is about security.


5.  Acknowledgements

   The bulk of the algorithm described in this document came out of a
   discussion with Emil Ivov and Pal-Erik Martinsen.  Eric Rescorla and
   Bernard Aboba provided some feedback on *mumble*.
