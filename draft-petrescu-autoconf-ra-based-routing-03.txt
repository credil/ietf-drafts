       Router Advertisements for Routing between Moving Networks
            draft-petrescu-autoconf-ra-based-routing-03.txt

Abstract

   This draft specifies extensions to the ICMPv6 Router Advertisement
   messages and processing.  Traditionally, prefixes contained in RAs
   are used for on-link determination, on-link address auto-
   configuration, but not for path setup towards multi-hop destinations.
   The extensions proposed here still rely on RAs being communicated on
   a single link (not across several IP hops), but upon RA reception the
   prefixes are installed in the routing table; they are thus used for
   forwarding packets further than a single link (multi IP hop).

Internet-Draft              RA-based Routing               November 2012


1.  Introduction

   This draft specifies extensions to the ICMPv6 Router Advertisement
   messages and processing.  Traditionally, prefixes contained in RAs
   are used for on-link determination, on-link address auto-
   configuration, but not for path setup towards multi-hop destinations.
   The extensions proposed here still rely on RAs being communicated on
   a single link (not across several IP hops), but upon RA reception the
   prefixes are installed in the routing table; they are thus used for
   forwarding packets further than a single link (multi IP hop).

   We present the message exchange diagrams, message formats and
   algorithm executed by a node.  The scenarios implying route addition
   are: simultaneous power-up of 3 Mobile Routers, arrival of a MR in a
   zone where other MRs are present; and scenarios for route deletion:
   timeout expiration of route entry, and explicit deletion of route
   entry.

   These RA extensions are intended for path establishment between LFNs
   in separate moving networks.  The Mobile Routers in charge of moving
   networks exchange their prefixes (with RAs), and set up their routing
   tables.  The exchanged prefixes scopes are global [RFC4291] or local
   [RFC4193].  In practice, applications may treat "Unique Local
   Addresses" [RFC4193] as global scoped addresses.

   The mechanism presented in this draft is an evolution of an earlier
   work [I-D.petrescu-manemo-nano].  This document adds the behaviour
   for MR arrival at a zone where other MRs are present, and the
   behaviour for route deletion.

   A similar mechanism is presented in "Mobile Network Prefix
   Provisioning" [I-D.jhlee-mext-mnpp].  The 'MNPP' draft addresses a
   specific need of inter-connecting vehicular networks; it considers
   use cases with or without fixed Access Point (infrastructure-based
   and infrastructure-less scenarios).  In this draft we do not consider
   the use of an Access Point, neither the infrastructure-based
   scenario.  On another hand, this draft describes additional route
   deletion scenarios, whereas the MNPP draft doesn't.

   Communicating directly between two Mobile Routers, using their egress
   interfaces, and without access to infrastructure can be considered as
   Route Optimization: traffic between LFNs of different moving networks
   is avoiding reaching the respective Home Agents (presumably placed in
   the infrastructure).  Whereas this RA-based work is not explicitely
   addressing Route Optimization, the effect of updating routing tables
   can be considered to be so; such an effect can be also achieved by
   extensions to the Mobile IPv6 protocol, as is suggested, for example,
   by a recent Internet Draft titled "Mobile IPv6 Route Optimization

   without Home Agent", authored by G. Hampel and T. Klein, named
   draft-hampel-mext-ro-without-ha-00, and posted on February 23rd,
   2011.  It proposes extensions to Mobile IPv6 protocol to conduct
   Route Optimization without Home Agent, in particular by introducing a
   concept of virtual home link and virtual home address.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Mobile Router (MR) - a Mobile Router.

   Mobile Network Prefix (MNP) - the Mobile Network Prefix is
   topologically correct on the ingress interface of a Mobile Router.

   Egress interface of MR - the interface sending the special Router
   Advertisements to other egress interface of other Mobile Routers (by
   this draft's recommendation).

   Ingress interface of MR - the interface towards the Local Fixed Nodes
   in the moving network and on which the Mobile Network Prefix (MNP) is
   topologically correct.


3.  Use-cases

   Several use-cases in the context of a City public transportation may
   take advantage of direct communications between vehicles (without
   infrastructure), or between a vehicle and a bus stop.

3.1.  Communication between Security Vehicle and RATP Vehicle

   The environment consists of a Security Vehicle (such as public
   safety) and a RATP Vehicle (a bus).  The goal: during an incident
   happenning within the bus, use a webcam to inform the security agents
   (in the security vehicle) about the ongoing event developments.  The
   use-case: a bus is driven along a typical scheduled drive.  A
   passenger aggression incident is declared within bus.  The driver
   silently triggers the red-button alarm.  The security vehicle
   approaches bus and agents query the live video feed sent by the bus
   webcam.  This is illustrated in the following figure:

3.2.  RATP Vehicle (bus) Approaching a Bus Stop

   The environment consists of an RATP vehicle (a typical public
   transportation bus) and a bus stop equipped of a WiFi Access Point.
   The goal: augment the precision of waiting time reporting to
   passenger waiting at the bus stop.  Currently, the waiting time is
   reported on a display at the bus stop; its precision is in the order
   of 1-2 minutes (i.e. it may happen that the display reports 2minute
   wait time whereas the bus is actually at 30second distance).  The bus
   is equipped of a GPS receiver.  Use-case: the passenger is waiting at
   the bus stop.  S/he scans the wait time reported on the display.
   When the bus is within a range of 200 meter the display reports
   "Approaching"; when the bus is within a 25 meter range the display
   reports ("At the stop").

3.3.  Visualizing Bus Stop Prior to Arrival

   The environments consists of a RATP vehicle and a WiFi station at the
   bus stop.  Goal: ability to access a webcam deployed at the bus stop,
   which allows the bus driver to see how crowded the stop is and the
   type of potential passengers.  It thus offers the driver the
   opportunity to plan the fitting of the bus on the arrival ramp.  Use-
   case: the bus approaches the bus stop; the driver sees on the screen
   the passengers waiting at the stop; the driver notices the presence
   of a stroller and a wheelchair; the driver prepares the correct
   arrival at the ramp and extension of the arm serving mobility.

4.  Protocol

4.1.  Topology

   These RA protocol extensions were conceived in a context of vehicular
   networks.  It was considered that a vehicle contains a moving
   network.  A moving network is composed of one Mobile Router (MR) and
   several Local Fixed Nodes (LFNs).  The MR has one egress interface
   and one ingress interface.  The egress interface is used to connect
   to other vehicles whereas the ingress interface connects to the LFNs
   in the vehicle.

   For example, two moving networks connecting via their egress
   interfaces are depicted below:



                    Vehicle 1                          Vehicle 2

                           egress|              |egress
             ----     ----    ----              ----     ----    ----
            | LFN|   |LFN |  | MR |            | MR |   |LFN |  |LFN |
             ----     ----    ----              ----     ----    ----
               |        | ingress|              |ingress   |      |
              ---------------------             ---------------------
                2001:db8:1::/40                      2001:db8:2::/40



   In this figure, the Mobile Network Prefix (MNP) deployed in vehicle 1
   is 2001:db8:1::/40, for example.  If ULA addresses are in use inside
   the vehicles (convenient for communications between a limited set of
   sites), the above figure prefixes could be, for example: FD78:ADC8:
   857A::/48 and FDD3:48A5:2D72::/48 for vehicles 1 and 2, respectively.
   For more information about ULA prefixes generation, please refer to
   [RFC4193] It is also possible for a MR to generate ULA prefixes based
   on its Vehicular Identification Number (VIN).  The use of VIN numbers
   to generate ULA prefixes will be detailed in a future draft.  The
   problem is how to establish IP paths between the LFNs between the two
   vehicles; initially the MR in one vehicle only knows about the MNP in
   its own vehicle.

4.2.  Operation on a Mobile Router

   We propose to use a special kind of prefixes in the Router
   Advertisements.  MR sends RA on its egress interface.  A receiving MR
   installs the pair MNP-LL in its forwarding information base (routing
   table, destination cache, tbd).

Internet-Draft              RA-based Routing               November 2012


   Each Mobile Router maintains a forwarding information structure that
   contains entries of the form:

   o  Mobile Network Prefix

   o  Gateway address

   o  Lifetime

   o  Name of outgoing interface

   o  Optionally link-layer address of Gateway

   This data structure is managed mainly at the reception of the special
   Router Advertisements, and when timers expire.  This structure can be
   implemented as part of the Destination Cache, Binding Cache, Routing
   Table or Forwarding Information Base.

   We present more details of the MR operation in the following section.

4.3.  Message Exchange

   The message exchange for the scenario of simultaneous power-up of 3
   MRs is pictured in the diagram below:




                    MR1                MR2                MR3

   o  All Mobile Routers connect their egress interface with a wireless
      MAC protocol, for example 802.11 MAC.  We consider mainly the case
      where the "ad-hoc" mode is used; we do not consider the presence
      of an Access Point - the two moving networks should be able to
      connect to each other without the use of fixed Access Points.

   o  Following link-layer successful connectivity, each Mobile Router
      joins the all-routers multicast address on the egress interface
      (typically using a link-local address, pictured as LL1).

   o  Each Mobile Router multicasts special RAs on the egress interface,
      containing the Mobile Network Prefix that is assigned to its
      moving network.  A Mobile Router SHOULD wait for a random delay
      [RFC4861] before sending the special RA.  If the first special RA
      contains a ULA prefix, the next special RAs sent should contain
      ULA prefixes as well, if available.  This is to avoid "mixing" ULA
      addresses [RFC4193] and global addresses [RFC4291] in the same
      packet.  This is not forbidden though.

   o  When receiving the special RA from another MR, a MR parses the
      packet for the link-local address of the sending MR, for the MNP
      sent by that MR and for the lifetime.  It then installs the
      corresponding entry into the data structure mentioned earlier.

   o  Before leaving the Fixed Scene, a Mobile Router sends another
      special RA to all routers this time informing them that the MNP-
      linklocaladdress pair is no longer present at the scene (lifetime
      0 as per [RFC4191]), so the other routers delete the corresponding
      route.  It could also courteously multicast a MLD REPORT to leave
      the all-routers multicast group, if necessary.  This Mobile Router
      SHOULD wait for a random delay before sending the special RA
      message.

   o  Operation of the Mobile Router when forwarding packets (after
      installation of the MNP-ll route) is similar to that of any
      router: for each packet not addressed to itself, longest-prefix
      match the destination address of the packet to an entry in the
      table, select the 'gateway' address, solicit that neighbour's MAC
      address and put the received MAC address in the link-layer dst
      address then send it.

   With this mechanism, the various LFNs in the moving networks are
   capable to exchange IP messages, routed by two Mobile Routers each
   time.  Longest-prefix match can still be used to take the next hop
   forwarding decision regardless whether the destination address is
   global scoped or Unique Local IPv6 address.

   For faster discovery of the Mobile Network Prefixes of the other

   Mobile Routers, a certain Mobile Router can send a special Router
   Solicitation right after joining the scene.  A random delay [RFC4861]
   SHOULD be introduced before sending any RS/RA message in order to
   prevent RS/RA storms when several Mobile Routers join or leave the
   Fixed Scene.

   For the scenario of arrival of an MR in a zone where other MRs are
   present, the message exchange diagram is depicted below:

   The arriving MR is the one using the Mobile Router MR3.  MR1 and MR2
   have already exchanged their respective routes using the message
   exchange presented in the previous scenario.  The algorithm executed
   by MR3 is the following: (1) Send an RA containing the prefix(es)
   allocated to its subnets to which the ingress interfaces are
   connected (2) "Join" the all-routers multicast address with link-
   scope, on its egress interface (3) Send a Router Solicitation (RS) on
   its egress interface requesting RAs from MR1 and MR2 (4) Receive
   their special RAs: RA1 and RA2 (5) For each received RA, extract the
   source address and the prefixes and insert the corresponding number
   of routing table entries; these entries will help reach the LFNs in
   the moving networks of MR1 and MR2.

   For route deletion, we consider two scenarios: timeout expiration of
   route entry, and explicit deletion of route entry.  The following
   diagram depicts timeout expiration of a route entry:

   This first scenario for deleting a routing table entry consists in
   associating a timeout value on each entry present in the routing
   table.  Such an entry typically contains the destination prefix, the
   IP address of the next hop gateway and eventually the interface name.
   The new timeout value is obtained from the "Lifetime" field of the
   RA.  With this value, each MR executes the following algorithm for
   each entry present in its routing table: (1) Set variable lt to the
   contents of the timeout value of the routing table entry (2)
   Decrement lt (3) Wait 1 milisecond (4) If lt is different than 0 jump
   to step 2, otherwise jump to step 5 (5) Delete this entry (6) Send an
   RS to the next-hop IP address of this routing table entry (7) If an
   RA is received then re-insert the routing table entry.

   The second scenario for deleting routing table entries consists in an
   explicit indication by a Mobile Router to other Mobile Routers about
   its intention to quit the subnet, instructing them to remove the
   routing table entries relative to its subnets (their MNPs: Mobile
   Network Prefixes).  The explicit indication is part of the same
   special Router Advertisement.  In practice, this effect could be
   achieved in two different ways: either specify a 'D' flag for a
   certain MNP, or alternatively use a lifetime '0' attached to same MNP
   ('0' meaning that the deletion request is immediate).

   The message exchange for explicit deletion is depicted in the figure
   below.  The Mobile Router MR1 sends RA1 containing the indication for
   immediate deletion (flag 'D', or lifetime '0') and the mobile network
   prefix MNP1.  Upon receipt of this message, MR2 and MR3 search their
   respective routing tables for the MNP1 and then delete these routing
   table entries.

4.4.  Message Formats

   Router Advertisement is a message format defined in [RFC4861] as an
   ICMPv6 message.  The document [RFC5175] proposes an option for RA
   extensibility: IPv6 Router Advetisement Flags Option.  We propose to
   reserve bit 16 for Mobile Network Prefixes.



        0                   1                   2                   3

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   'M' - Mobile Network Prefix present.  Set to 1 if this Router
   Advertisement contains a Mobile Network Prefix.

   If the RA Flags Option contais the flag M, and set to 1, then the
   Router Advertisement MUST contain a Route Information Option
   [RFC4191] followed optionally by a Source-Link Layer Address Option
   [RFC4861].  (If this SLLAO option is used then it avoids the
   necessity of doing NS/NA exchange for the link-local address of the
   Gateway entry in the data structure mentioned earlier.)

   A complete diagram of the Router Advertisement is presented in the
   figure below:

           structure.

   Destination Address

           IPv6 all-routers multicast address with link-scope.

           Preference, value 0x09; this route should not be preferred
           over other default routes.

   Prefix (in Router Information Option)

           The Mobile Network Prefix of this Mobile Router.

   Link-Layer Address (optional)

           Link-layer address of the egress interface of the MR.  The
           receiving MR can use this address for sending packets to the
           MR that advertises a certain MNP.

   A Mobile Router MUST NOT include Prefix Information Options [RFC4861]
   into the special Router Advertisements so that the receiving Mobile
   Routers don't auto-configure addresses based on these prefixes.

   A Mobile Router MUST NOT auto-configure an address derived from the
   Mobile Network Prefix found within a received special Router
   Advertisement.


5.  Security Considerations

   RA security.

   It is of utmost importance that the Mobile Routers exchange the
   special Router Advertisements securely.

   SeND [RFC3971] permits to bind an address to a public key.  But not a
   prefix.  This may involve concepts of the prefix-ownership problem
   space.

   It is necessary to build a threat model for this scenario and
   mechanism, analyze the security tools offered by SeND and identify
   the potential risks and their mitigation.

   In some cases it is possible that a moving network is connected to
   the Internet, in addition to being connected to other moving
   networks.  If so, it may be advantageous to update PKI certificates,
   or similar operation, in order to ensure a more secure connectivity
   to other moving networks.

   Some kinds of link layers used for establishing the link connectivity
   between the egress interfaces (e.g.  IEEE 802.11b) offer several
   means of authentication and confidentiality - at link-layer: e.g.
   WEP, WPA, more.  It may be advantageous to make use of these secure
   link-layer mechanisms.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA no action.
