This document presents an approach to modify the bandwidth and
possibly other parameters of an established CR-LSP (Constraint-based
Routed Label Switched Paths) using CR-LDP (Constraint-based Routed
Label Distribution Protocol) without service interruption.  After a
CR-LSP is set up, its bandwidth reservation may need to be changed by
the network operator, due to the new requirements for the traffic
carried on that CR-LSP.  The LSP modification feature can be supported
by CR-LDP by use of the _modify_value for the _action indicator flag_
in the LSPID TLV.  This feature has application in dynamic network
resources management where traffic of different priorities and service
classes is involved.

This document is a product of the Multiprotocol Label Switching
Working Group of the IETF.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
