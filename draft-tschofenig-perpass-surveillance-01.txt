Abstract

   Surveillance is the observation or monitoring of an individual's
   communications or activities.  Surveillance is one of several privacy
   /security threats engineers try to take into account in their
   designs.  The reports about pervasive monitoring of Internet traffic
   have, however, surprised many since the scale was not envisaged
   during the design of many Internet protocols even though the ambition
   to offer end-to-end security on the Internet dates back even to the
   70ies.  The approach to get access to meta-data as well as to
   communication content has taken forms that are largely
   indistinguishable from ordinary attacks.

   This document explains the attacks in context of the larger Internet
   eco-system.

1.  Introduction

   Securing the Internet is a rather complicated task since the threat
   landscape has changed significantly over the last 20 years.  For many
   of the recognized security weaknesses solutions have been developed
   and standardized.  Unfortunately, the existence of specifications by
   itself is not enough: security protocols need to be implemented and
   deployed.  Since many of the tougher security challenges suffer from
   a collective action problem it typically takes many years until
   widespread deployment has been reached (typically requiring
   sufficient energy and enough pain).  The recently observed pervasive
   monitoring activities represent a new challenge to the Internet
   community and require us to review and revisit some earlier design
   decisions.

   To fully understand the role of the IETF in this context it is useful
   to look at the types of attacks that are occurring.  It quickly
   becomes clear that the development of many countermeasures is
   entirely within scope of the IETF.  But the deployment and use is

   outside out scope, and requires interactions with the larger Internet
   eco-system.

2.  Attack Surface

   The attack surface is categorized into four areas, as shown in Figure
   1.  In subsequent sections more details are provided and examples are
   listed.

2.1.  Cryptographic Primitives

   Internet security relies on sound cryptographic primitives, such as
   hash functions, random number generators, integrity and encryption
   algorithms, etc.  The basic design philosophy is that the strength of
   keyed algorithms relies on the length of the secret/private key.  It
   is well-known that these cryptographic primitives "age" as processing
   power of computing hardware increases.  This means that over time it
   is faster to search through the key space with the same amount of
   financial budget spent.  (Note: How much of the key space an
   adversary has to search depends on a number of factors.  Due to the
   birthday paradoxon it has to search on average 1/2 of the key space.
   It can actually be much lower when lower entrophy secrets are used,
   such as passwords.)  Researchers have also made improvements in
   analyzing the building blocks of these algorithms and new attack
   techniques (such as side channel attacks).  This has lead to a
   continued development of new cryptographic primitives.

   The IETF has played a minor role in the work on cryptographic
   primitives.  Instead, it has been a consumer of these building blocks
   and has therefore relied on others to select specifications and to
   provide guidance.  As an exception one could see the publication of
   HMAC [20].  In fact, the crypto-community world-wide is rather small
   and for a variety of reasons the National Institute of Standards and
   Technology (NIST) has spearheaded many of these developments.  The
   IETF security community has relied on NIST to provide guidance
   largely because no other groups have come forward to offer advice.

   While there have been problems with weaknesses in cryptographic
   primitives (e.g., RC4 [1], [2], [3]) those have not been a
   substantial issue from a standardization point of view thanks to
   'crypto-agility'.  (Note that RC4 is not a NIST standard.)  Crypto-
   agility is the ability of a protocol to adapt to evolving
   cryptographic algorithms and security requirements.  This includes
   provisions that allow security protocols to adopt different
   cryptographic algorithms without substantial disruption to deployed
   implementations.  This does not mean the implementation is unchanged
   and, of course, the need for backwards compatibility creates
   downgrade attacks.

   Rumors about backdoors in specific elliptic curves, and random number
   generators have created some uncertainty about what algorithms are
   'safe' to use.  The crypto-community is still debating about the
   validity of these claims and investigating about how long weaknesses
   in standards should have been known to experts.

2.2.  Protocols and Architecture

   Internet protocols and communication architectures belong to the core
   expertise of the IETF.  While security experts have been around in
   the early days of the IETF the security community grew over time
   after security considerations sections became a mandatory part of
   IETF specifications [21].  The overall understanding of security is
   still increasing thanks to education efforts, reviews from the
   security area directorate, and the push back from the IESG when
   questionable documents arrive.

   Still, there are a number of challenges.  For example, cryptographic
   attacks like BEAST [5], CRIME [6], and Lucky Thirteen [4] targeted
   the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol when specific algorithms
   are used with specific application layer protocols (such as HTTP).
   More difficult to deal with are security and privacy challenges with
   entire protocols architectures, as the design of email, instant
   messaging, voice over IP (VoIP), DNS, DHCP, etc. demonstrate.  Often,
   insecure versions of a protocol are standardized and completed first
   before the secure version is developed.  For example, consider
   security for HTTP, SIP, XMPP, eMail, etc.  While this may not have a
   consequence on paper it certainly impacts follow-up implementations
   and deployments.  Section 8 of [19] provides an interesting summary
   of the design tradeoffs that had been made in the real-time
   communication architecture as used by VoIP and instant messaging.
   The difficulty is often not in crafting a security solution at the
   level of a single specification, but rather ensuring that the
   protocol development of an entire communication architecture provides
   good security and privacy properties after many years of
   standardization when various different industry trends (such as cloud

   computing, and the JavaScript-based Web), and the interests of
   participating parties re-shape the original design goals.
   Furthermore, often the attention is paid on protecting the payload of
   the content only and meta-data is exposed to service providers and
   other parties, particularly with server-centric communication
   architectures.

   In many cases, the implications of certain design decisions are
   subtle.  Two examples are:

   Cookies:  For example, the excitement of Web companies to use HTTP
      cookies [23], [22] as a replacement for cryptographic
      authentication was hard to anticipate.

   VoIP Media Security:  The large number of key exchange mechanisms
      standardized for VoIP (see [16], [17], [15]) might have provided
      ways to fulfill needs of different deployment scenarios but
      certainly confused the industry and didn't increase
      interoperability.  New VoIP security authentication protocols are
      still proposed today.

   Another example for an architectural weakness can be found with the
   public key infrastructure (PKI) when the limitations of the PKI
   became apparent in 2011: DigiNotar, a Dutch certification authority,
   had a security breach and in the same year a Comodo affiliate was
   compromised.  Both cases lead to fraudulent issue of certificates
   allowing man-in-the-middle attacks on TLS secured data Web
   interactions.  There have been claims that the same architectural
   vulnerability has been exploited by the National Security Agency
   (NSA) in man-in-the-middle attacks [14].

   Improving security and privacy for different communication protocols
   has been subject of discussion on the IETF perpass list [9].  Note
   that some discussions go beyond suggesting actions for the IETF; they
   belong to the discussion in Section 2.3 and Section 2.4.  As another
   example of ongoing work is a document on best current practices for
   Transport Layer Security [18], which gathers experience from recent
   security attacks and recommends state-of-the-art ciphersuites.

2.3.  Implementations

   Once standardization work is completed the specifications have to be
   implemented.  Often those who develop the specifications are not
   necessary the same parties who implement the software.  The
   specifications therefore have to offer enough context and be readable
   to avoid security problems via misinterpretation.  Also, those who
   implement and those who deploy are also not necessarily the same set
   of people.  For example, some developers write open source libraries

   useful for a wide range of communities, as it is the case with
   OpenSSL or GnuTLS.  Note: This description is rather simplified
   version of the typical IETF protocol development.  In many cases, the
   development process is not linear since protocols are implemented
   while they are specified and implementation results are fed back into
   the standardization effort.  Still, for many successful protocols
   implementations the number of those involved in implementations far
   exceeds the number of standardization participants.

   Implementations may show a number of security weaknesses, such as
   lack of security features, quality of the implementations (e.g.,
   implementations with insufficient penetration testing), weak pseudo-
   random number generators [7], [10], etc.  Since the source code of
   many implementations is not available to the public, backdoors may be
   built-in, as it was rumored with [8].

   Many implementations of Web applications, however, suffer from basic
   vulnerabilities (such as injection or cross-site scripting attacks),
   as the top-10 charts of the Open Web Application Security Project
   (OWASP) reveal [12].  Sometimes vendors make design decisions for
   their product implementations that lead to security vulnerabilities,
   for example when devices are shipped with default-passwords or with
   enabled debugging interfaces [13].

2.4.  Deployment

   Finally, implementations of various protocols are put together and
   complete systems are deployed.  Those who deploy have to make
   decisions that go beyond pure protocol aspects; for example, they
   have to consider various configuration options.  These deployment
   decisions have an important impact on the provided privacy and
   security properties.  Examples include, backend server protocols
   secured only with "physical security" (i.e., without cryptographic
   security protection), email services without TLS protection, custom
   security designs (see, for example, WhatsApp [11]), etc.  Depending
   on the jurisdiction within which a service is provided, those who
   deploy systems may assume certain for data retention, and support for
   lawful intercept.
