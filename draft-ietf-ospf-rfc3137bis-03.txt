                     OSPF Stub Router Advertisement
                     draft-ietf-ospf-rfc3137bis-03

Abstract

   This document describes a backward-compatible technique that may be
   used by OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) implementations to advertise
   unavailability to forward transit traffic or to lower the preference
   level for the paths through such a router.

Internet-Draft       OSPF Stub Router Advertisement         January 2013


1.  Introduction

   In some situations, it may be advantageous to inform routers in a
   network not to use a specific router as a transit point, but still
   route to it.  Possible situations include the following:

   o  The router is in a critical condition (for example, has very high
      CPU load or does not have enough memory to store all LSAs or build
      the routing table).

   o  Graceful introduction and removal of the router to/from the
      network.

   o  Other (administrative or traffic engineering) reasons.

   Note that the solution introduced in this document does not remove
   the router from the topology view of the network (as could be done by
   just flushing that router's router-LSA), but discourages other
   routers from using it for transit routing, while still routing
   packets to the router's own IP addresses, i.e., the router is
   announced as a stub.

   It must be emphasized that the solution provides real benefits in
   networks designed with at least some level of redundancy so that
   traffic can be routed around the stub router.  Otherwise, traffic
   destined for the networks reachable through such a stub router may
   still be routed through it.


2.  Solutions

   The solution introduced in this document solves two challenges
   associated with the outlined problem.  In the description below,
   router X is the router announcing itself as a stub.

   1)  Making other routers prefer routes around router X while
       performing the Dijkstra calculation.

   2)  Allowing other routers to reach IP prefixes directly connected to
       router X.

   Note that it would be easy to address issue 1) alone by just flushing
   router X's router-LSA from the domain.  However, it does not solve
   problem 2), since other routers will not be able to use links to
   router X in Dijkstra (no back link), and because router X will not
   have links to its neighbors.

   To address both problems, router X announces its router-LSA to the

   neighbors with the costs of all non-stub links (links of the types
   other than 3) set to MaxLinkMetric.

   The solution above applies to both OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and OSPFv3
   [RFC5340].

2.1.  OSPFv3-only Solution

   OSPFv3 [RFC5340] introduced additional options to provide similar, if
   not better, control of the forwarding topology; the R-bit provides a
   more granular indication of whether a router is active and should be
   used for transit traffic.

   It is left to network operators to decide which technique to use in
   their network.


3.  Maximum Link Metric

   Section 2 refers to the cost of all non-stub links as MaxLinkMetric,
   which is a new fixed architectural value introduced in this document.

   MaxLinkMetric
      The metric value indicating that the link described by an LSA
      should not be used as transit.  Used in router-LSAs (see
      Section 2).  It is defined to be the 16-bit binary value of all
      ones: 0xffff.


4.  Deployment Considerations

   When using MaxLinkMetric, some inconsistency may be seen if the
   network is constructed of routers that perform intra-area Dijkstra
   calculation as specified in [RFC1247] (discarding link records in
   router-LSAs that have a MaxLinkMetric cost value) and routers that
   perform it as specified in [RFC1583] and higher (do not treat links
   with MaxLinkMetric cost as unreachable).  Note that this
   inconsistency will not lead to routing loops, because if there are
   some alternate paths in the network, both types of routers will agree
   on using them rather than the path through the stub router.  If the
   path through the stub router is the only one, the routers of the
   first type will not use the stub router for transit (which is the
   desired behavior), while the routers of the second type will still
   use this path.

   On the other hand, clearing the R-bit will consistently result in the
   router not being used as transit.

5.  Security Considerations

   The technique described in this document does not introduce any new
   security issues into the OSPF protocol.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

Appendix A.  Change Log

A.1.  Changes between the -00 and -01 versions.

   o  Defined a new architectural constant (MaxLinkMetric) to eliminate
      any confusion about the interpretation of LSInfinity.

   o  Added a section to reference the R-bit and V6-bit in OSPFv3.

   o  Updated acks and contact information.

A.2.  Changes between the -01 and -02 versions.

   o  Took out references to not having a standard solution and
      incorporated the R-bit solution as part of the (renamed)
      "Solutions" section.

   o  Various minor edits and reordered sections.

A.3.  Changes between the -02 and -03 versions.

   o  Updated contact information.

   o  Renamed the 'Motivation' section to 'Introduction' becuase of an
      error in idnits.

   o  Took out the rfc2119 references as none of the keywords are used
      in the text.

   o  Added an 'IANA Considerations' section to indicate that there are
      no actions required.
