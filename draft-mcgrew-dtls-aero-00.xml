      <t>
	  Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) is a communication
	  security protocol that is attractive for use in constrained
	  environments, in which it is important to minimize the data
	  expansion added by the security protocol, and to support
	  multicast security .  Authenticated Encryption with Replay
	  prOtection (AERO) is a cryptographic technique that is well
	  suited for use in DTLS, especially in these scenarios: it
	  has minimal data expansion, avoids the need to manage
	  implicit state, works well with multiple receivers and
	  multiple senders, and provides strong misuse resistance.
	  This document describes how AERO can be used in DTLS.

<!--
     <t>
       This note is structured as follows.  <xref target="intro"/>
       introduces the basic idea.   IANA considerations and security
       considerations follow in <xref target="iana"/> and <xref
       target="security"/>, respectively.
     </t>
-->

  <t>
    It is challenging to provide communication security in constrained
    environments.  Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) <xref
    target="RFC6347"/> has emerged as a communication security
    protocol of choice for such environments; for instance, a binding
    of DTLS to the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) <xref
    target="I-D.ietf-core-coap"/> has been defined, and it appears
    that a profile of DTLS will be "reasonably implementable" on
    constrained devices <xref target="DICE"/>.  One important
    constraint is bandwidth, which is often a scarce resource in
    wireless environments, most especially when the transmitter or
    receiver is battery-powered.  This motivates the use of
    cryptographic transforms that minimize the size of the data
    overhead, that is, the additional bytes that must be communicated
    in order to add confidentiality, message authentication, and
    replay protection to each message.
    </t>
    <t>
     There is also interest in using DTLS for protecting multicast
     messages, which are commonplace in the Internet of Things
     environments <xref target="I-D.keoh-tls-multicast-security"/>.
     Standards work is underway to consider the use of DTLS record
     layer for this purpose <xref target="DICE"/> (though work on key
     management has not yet been chartered).  For multicast
     applications, it is important to use cryptographic mechanisms
     that can easily and securely work with multiple receivers and
     with multiple senders.
    </t>
    <t> 
      In addition to meeting the needs identified above, cryptographic
      transforms should be robust against implementation failure and
      misuse, and should not rely on implicit state, which is
      problematic to synchronize, especially when there are multiple
      senders and receivers.

  <t>
   Authenticated encryption <xref target="BN00"/> is a form of
   encryption that, in addition to providing confidentiality for the
   plaintext that is encrypted, provides a way to check its integrity
   and authenticity.  Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data,
   or AEAD <xref target="R02"/>, adds the ability to check the
   integrity and authenticity of some Associated Data (AD), also
   called "additional authenticated data", that is not encrypted.
  </t>
  <t>
   AEAD is used in DTLS, which also incorporates replay protection
   using an sequence number that is carried in the packet, which is
   authenticated because it is part of the associated data.  This
   security service enables the receiver of a message to detect when a
   received message is a duplicate of a previously received message.
   Authenticated Encryption with Replay prOtection (AERO) extends AEAD
   so that it provides a replay protection service.  By combining
   authentication and replay protection, and by not requiring a nonce,
   it minimizes the bandwidth overhead.  
   </t>
-->
   <t>
	Authenticated Encryption with Replay prOtection (AERO)
	<xref target="I-D.mcgrew-aero"/>
	is a cryptographic technique that provides all of the
	essential security services needed by a communication security
	protocol.  It is a stateful and self-synchronizing
	authenticated encryption method that provides protection from
	replay attacks as a side benefit.  Replay protection and
	authentication are provided through a single mechanism, in
	which a sequence number is encrypted along with a plaintext
	message.  If the ciphertext message is not tampered with, then
	this sequence number will be recovered by the decrypter, and
	verified to be valid.  If the ciphertext message is a replay
	of an earlier message, then the decrypter will detect this
	fact from the recovered sequence number.  If the ciphertext
	message is tampered with, or is crafted as a forgery, this
	fact will be apparent to the decrypter because the value that
	should be a valid sequence number is instead a pseudorandom value.

  </t>


</section>

<section title="Using AERO in DTLS">
<t>
  AERO is an authenticated encryption mechanism, and it can be used
  through the standard AEAD interface <xref target="RFC5116"/>, as
  defined in Section 3.6 of <xref target="I-D.mcgrew-aero"/>.  TLS
  version 1.2 defines how to use an AEAD method through the that
  interface, via the TLS GenericAEADCipher (see Section 6.2.3.3. of
  <xref target="RFC5246"/>).  This note follows these earlier
  specifications, except where otherwise noted.
  </t>
  <t>
    When AERO is used in DTLS, SecurityParameters.record_iv_length is
    equal to zero, since AERO algorithms do not require the use of a
    nonce or initialization vector.  Thus, the nonce_explicit field in
    the GenericAEADCipher structure has a length of zero.
  </t>
  <t>
    The AEAD key and plaintext are as specified in Section 6.2.3.3. of
    <xref target="RFC5246"/>.
  </t>
  <t>
    The AEAD associated data is denoted as additional_data and is
    computed as
  <list>
    <t>
      additional_data = TLSCompressed.type + TLSCompressed.version + TLSCompressed.length;
    </t>			
  </list>
   where "+" denotes concatenation.  The seq_num field is omitted from
   the additional_data because its authentication is not needed, since
   AERO detects replay attacks.
  </t>
<t>
  In DTLS version 1.3, the epoch and sequence_number fields MUST be
  omitted from the DTLSPlaintext.  In DTLS version 1.2, those fields
  MUST be present.
</t>
<t>
  <list>
    <t>
      Rationale:  With AERO, the epoch and sequence_number fields are
      not needed.  Omitting those fields enables each message sent to
      save eight bytes of overhead, a value that is significant for
      some applications, and it makes the on-the-wire data format
      identical to that of TLS does, which could simplify
      implementations.  We specify this omission for version 1.3, but
      not the earlier version, in order to avoid overloading the
      earlier version with complexity.  By omitting the seq_num from
      the additional_data computation, we enable an AERO
      implementation to work the same way for both versions 1.2 and
      1.3 of DTLS, providing compatibility.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>

<section title="Multicast">
  <t>
    DTLS-AERO is suitable for use in one-to-many scenarios such as
    those described in <xref
    target="I-D.keoh-tls-multicast-security"/>.  In order to use
    DTLS-AERO it for many-to-many scenarios, in which more than one
    entity is using a single key for encryption, it would be necessary
    to modify the definition of DTLS in such a way that each receiver
    could unambiguously identify each sender.  This could be done by
    having a receiver use the source IP address and source port of the
    packet that carried the DTLS record, or by adding a new field to
    DTLS that works like the Synchronization Source (SSRC) identifier
    field in the Real-time Transport Protocol <xref
    target="RFC3550"/>.  In either case, the fields that are used to
    identify the sender should be part of the authenticated data.  We
    emphasize that the change needs to be made to DTLS, and not to
    AERO, which is inherently capable of handling scenarios in which
    there are multiple devices performing encryption with a single
    key.

    <section anchor="iana" title="IANA Considerations">
 
      <t>
	There are no requests to IANA at this time.
	</t>

	<t>
	  A future version of this note will specify DTLS ciphersuites
	  that make use of AERO.
	</t>
    </section>



<section anchor="security" title="Security considerations">
<t>
  The security considerations of AERO are discussed in Section 11 of
  <xref target="I-D.mcgrew-aero"/>.  
  </t>
  <t>
    AERO works well in multiple-receiver scenarios, and it provides
    automatic (re)synchronization of replay protection state between
    the sender and receivers, including "late joiners" to the secure
    session.  It also works well for multiple-sender scenarios.  These
    topics are discussed in Sections 3.5, 6, and 11.4 of <xref
    target="I-D.mcgrew-aero"/>.
  </t>
  <t>
    AERO is robust against misuse, which is especially valuable in
    virtual machine environments and in devices that may be subject to
    tampering.
