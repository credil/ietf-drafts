The Service Location Protocol, Version 2 (SLPv2) provides a mechanism
for a service to be discovered in a single exchange of messages.  This
exchange of messages does not presently include any of the service's
attributes.  This document specifies a SLPv2 extension which allows
a User Agent (UA) to request a service's attributes be included as an
extension to Service Reply messages.  This will eliminate the need
for multiple round trip messages for a UA to acquire all service
information.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
