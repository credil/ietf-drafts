Abstract

   The demands on the networking infrastructure and thus the
   switch/router bandwidths are growing exponentially; the drivers are
   bandwidth hungry rich media applications, inter data center
   communications etc. Using sampling techniques, for a given sampling
   rate, the amount of samples that need to be processed is increasing
   exponentially. This draft suggests flow aware sampling techniques for
   handling various scenarios with minimal sampling overhead.

1. Introduction

   Packet sampling techniques in switches and routers provide an
   effective mechanism for approximate detection of various types of
   flows -- long-lived large flows and other flows (which include long-
   lived small flows, short-lived small/large flows) with minimal packet
   replication bandwidth overhead. A large percentage of the packet
   samples comprise of long-lived large flows and a small percentage of
   the packet samples comprise of other flows. The long-lived large
   flows aka top-talkers consume a large percentage of the bandwidth and
   small percentage of the flow space. The other flows, which are the
   typical cause of security threats like Denial of Service (DOS)
   attacks, Scanning attacks etc., consume a small percentage of the

   bandwidth and a large percentage of the flow space. This draft
   explores light-weight techniques for automatically detecting the top-
   talkers in real-time with a high degree of accuracy and sampling only
   the other flows -- this makes security threat detection more
   effective with minimal sampling overhead.

2. Flow Aware Packet Sampling

   The steps in flow aware packet sampling are described below

   1) Large Flow Recognition in switches and routers:

     From a bandwidth and time duration perspective, in order to
     identify large flows in switches and routers, we define an
     observation interval and observe the bandwidth of the flow over
     that interval.  A flow that exceeds a certain minimum bandwidth
     threshold over that observation interval would be considered a
     large flow. For identifying large flows, use the techniques
     described in Section 2.1. This helps in identifying the large
     flows aka top-talkers in real-time with a high degree of accuracy
     in switches and routers.

   2) Large Flow Classification:

Internet-Draft  Flow Aware Packet Sampling Techniques     February 2013


     The identified large flows can be broadly classified into 2
     categories as detailed below.

        a.  Well behaved (steady rate) large flows, e.g. video streams

        b.  Bursty (fluctuating rate) large flows e.g. Peer-to-Peer
          traffic

     The large flows can be sampled at a low rate for further analysis
     or need not be sampled. If desired, the large flows could be
     exported to a central entity, for e.g. sFlow Collector, for
     further analysis.

   3) Small Flow Processing:

     The small flows (excluding the large flows) can be sampled at a
     normal rate. The small flows can be examined for determining
     security threats like DOS attacks (for e.g. SYN floods), Scanning
     attacks etc. [LANCOPE]

   Thus, we can see that, security threat detection is possible with
   minimal sampling overhead.

   For packet sampling, it is recommended to use PSAMP -- [RFC 5474],
   [RFC 5475], [RFC 5476], [RFC 5477] or sFlow -- [sFlow-v5].

2.1. Large Flow Recognition

2.1.1. Flow Identification

   A flow (large flow or small flow) can be defined as a sequence of
   packets for which ordered delivery should be maintained.  Flows are
   typically identified using one or more fields from the packet header
   from the following list:

     .  Layer 2: source MAC address, destination MAC address, VLAN ID.

     .  IP header: IP Protocol, IP source address, IP destination
        address, flow label (IPv6 only), TCP/UDP source port, TCP/UDP
        destination port.

     .  MPLS Labels.

   For tunneling protocols like GRE, VXLAN, NVGRE, STT, etc., flow
   identification is possible based on inner and/or outer headers. The
   above list is not exhaustive.  The mechanisms described in this

   document are agnostic to the fields that are used for flow
   identification.

2.1.2. Criteria for Identifying a Large Flow

   From a bandwidth and time duration perspective, in order to identify
   large flows we define an observation interval and observe the
   bandwidth of the flow over that interval.  A flow that exceeds a
   certain minimum bandwidth threshold over that observation interval
   would be considered a large flow.

   The two parameters -- the observation interval, and the minimum
   bandwidth threshold over that observation interval -- should be
   programmable in a switch or a router to facilitate handling of
   different use cases and traffic characteristics. For example, a flow
   which is at or above 10 Mbps for a time period of at least 30 minutes
   could be declared a large flow.

   An optional parameter is a policy specification (for e.g. identify
   flows only from a given IP source and/or destination address)

2.1.3. Automatic Recognition

   Implementations can perform automatic recognition of large flows in a
   switch or a router -- it is an inline solution and would be expected
   to operate at line rate.

   The advantages and disadvantages of automatic recognition are:

   Advantages:

     .  Accurate and performed in real-time.

   Disadvantages:

     .  Not supported in many switches and routers.

   As mentioned earlier, the observation interval for determining a
   large flow and the bandwidth threshold for classifying a flow as a
   large flow should be programmable parameters in a switch or a router.

   The implementation of automatic recognition of large flows is vendor
   dependent. Below is a suggested technique.

   This technique uses a counting Bloom filter using thresholding and
   periodic reset. This technique requires a few tables -- a flow table,
   and multiple hash tables.


Krishnan               Expires August 23, 2013                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft  Flow Aware Packet Sampling Techniques     February 2013


   The flow table comprises entries which are programmed with packet
   fields for flows that are already known to be large flows and each
   entry has a corresponding byte counter.  It is initialized as an
   empty table (i.e. none of the incoming packets would match a flow
   table entry).

   The hash tables each have a different hash function and comprise
   entries which are byte counters.  The counters are initialized to
   zero and would be modified as described by the algorithm below.

   Step 1) If the large flow exists in the flow table (for e.g. TCAM),
   increment the counter associated with the flow by the packet size.
   Else, proceed to Step 2.

   Step 2) The hash function for each table is applied to the fields of
   the packet header and the result is looked up in parallel in
   corresponding hash table and the associated counter corresponding to
   the entry that is hit in that table is incremented by the packet
   size. If the counter exceeds a programmed byte threshold in the
   observation interval (this counter threshold would be set to match
   the bandwidth threshold) in the entries that were hit in all of the
   hash tables, a candidate large flow is learnt and programmed in the
   flow table and the counters are reset.

   Additionally, the counters in all of the hash tables must be reset
   every observation interval.

   There may be some false positives due to multiple small flows
   masquerading as a large flow. The number of such false positives is
   reduced by increasing the number of parallel hash tables using
   different hash functions.  There will be a design tradeoff between
   size of the hash tables, the number of hash tables, and the
   probability of a false positive.

   This technique for automatic recognition is also suggested in [draft-
   krishnan-opsawg-large-flow-load-balancing] -- please refer to the
   draft for more details on the algorithm.

2.1.3.1. Applicability of suggested technique

   The suggested technique for automatic recognition works well for
   standard applications generating large flows, for e.g. video content
   like movies and catch-up episodes, backup transactions etc. with a
   detection time of approximately 30-60 seconds. These detection times
   ensure that short-lived large flows, for e.g. HD video clips, are not
   unnecessarily recognized.

Internet-Draft  Flow Aware Packet Sampling Techniques     February 2013


2.1.3.2. Enhancements to suggested technique

   If faster flow recognition times are desired (much shorter than 30s),
   the suggested technique may pose the following problem that the
   effective filtered flow size is phase-dependent: that is, relatively
   smaller constant-rate flows, for e.g. HD video clips, beginning early
   within a counting Bloom filter reset interval would be unnecessarily
   detected with the same probability as relatively larger flows
   beginning toward the interval.

   [VRM] suggests techniques for addressing the above problem using
   rotating conservative counting Bloom filters with periodic decay.

2.1.3.1. Handling Inactive Large Flows

   Once a flow has been recognized as a large flow, it should continue
   to be recognized as a large flow as long as the traffic received
   during an observation interval exceeds some fraction of the bandwidth
   threshold, for example 80% of the bandwidth threshold. If the traffic
   received during an observation interval falls below a fraction of the
   bandwidth threshold, the large flow should be removed from the flow-
   table.

2.1.4. Simulation

   Simulation results for flow aware packet sampling are presented in
   Appendix A. The goal of the simulation is to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of flow aware packet sampling in a multi-tenant video
   streaming data center.

5. Security Considerations

   This document does not directly impact the security of the Internet
   infrastructure or its applications. In fact, it proposes techniques
   which could help in identifying a DOS attack pattern.

6. Data Model Considerations

   In Section 2, for exporting the identified large flows to an external
   entity, it is recommended to use IPFIX protocol [RFC 5101].

   Section 2.1.2 defines programmable parameters in switches and routers
   for automatic identification. IETF could potentially consider a
   standards-based activity around defining a data model for moving this
   information from a central management entity to the switch/router.

   Goal:

   Demonstrate the effectiveness of flow aware packet sampling in a
   practical use case, for e.g. multi-tenant video streaming in a data
   center.

   Test Topology:

   Multiple virtual servers (server hosted on a virtual machine)
   connected to a virtual switch (vSwitch) which in turn connects to the
   data center network using a 10Gbps ethernet interface.

   2 virtual servers are active.

   First virtual server

     .  Traffic types

          o HD MPEG-4 video streams (bit rate 10Mbps) - 100 - 1Gbps

          o SD MPEG-2 video streams (bit rate 4Mbps) - 300 - 1.2Gbps

          o Other traffic - 500Mbps (Video clips, DOS attacks (for e.g.
             SYN floods), Scanning attacks etc.)

     .  Aggregate traffic - 2.7Gbps

   Second virtual server

     .  Traffic types

          o HD MPEG-4 video streams (bit rate 10Mbps) - 50 - .5Gbps

          o SD MPEG-2 video streams (bit rate 4Mbps) - 500 - 2.0Gbps

          o Backup transaction - 100Mbps

          o Other traffic - 500Mbps (Video clips, DOS attacks (for e.g.
             SYN floods), Scanning attacks etc.)

     .  Aggregate traffic - 3.1Gbps

   Total traffic on 2 servers - 5.8Gbps

   Existing techniques:

   Normal sampling rate - 1:1000

Internet-Draft  Flow Aware Packet Sampling Techniques     February 2013


   Total sampled traffic = 5.8Gbps/1000 = 5.8Mbps

   Flow aware sampling technique:

   Large flow recognition parameters

     .  Observation interval for large flow - 60 seconds

     .  Minimum bandwidth threshold over the observation interval -
        2Mbps

   Aggregate bit rate of large flows = 4.8Gbps

   Aggregate bit rate of small flows = 1Gbps

   Low sampling rate of large flows - 1:10000

   Normal sampling rate of small flows - 1:1000

   Total sampled traffic = 4.8Gbps/10000 + 1Gbps/1000 = 1.48Mbps

   Percentage improvement in sampling (most of the samples are only
   small flows) = (5.8 - 1.48)/5.8 ~= 78%

   The small flows can be examined in a central entity like sFlow
   Collector for determining security threats like DOS attacks, Scanning
   attacks etc. Thus, we can see that, security threat detection is
   possible with minimal sampling overhead.
