Abstract

   This memo specifies 4rd technology's multicast component so that IPv4
   hosts can receive multicast data from IPv4 servers over an IPv6
   network.  In 4rd Translation Multicast solution for 4rd and
   translation variant of MAP, MAP-T, IGMP messages are translated into
   MLD messages at the CE router which is IGMP/MLD Proxy and sent to the
   network in IPv6. 4rd Border Relay does the reverse translation and
   joins IPv4 multicast group for 4rd hosts.  Border Relay as multicast
   router receives IPv4 multicast data and translates the packet into
   IPv6 multicast data and sends downstream on the multicast tree.
   Member CEs receive multicast data, translate it back to IPv4 and
   transmit to the hosts.  In 4rd encapsulation solution for
   encapsulation variant of MAP, MAP-E, IGMP Proxy at the 4rd Customer
   Edge router uses IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel established by MAP-E to exchange
   IGMP messages to establish multicast state at MAP Border Relay so
   that MAP Border Relay can tunnel IPv4 multicast data to IPv4 hosts
   connected to MAP Customer Edge device.

Internet-Draft          Multicast Support for 4rd              July 2012


1.  Introduction

   With IPv4 address depletion on the horizon, many techniques are being
   standardized for IPv6 migration including 4rd
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-map], [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd]. 4rd enables IPv4
   hosts to communicate with external hosts using IPv6 only ISP network.
   4rd Customer Edge (CE) device's LAN side is dual stack and WAN side
   is IPv6 only.  CE tunnels/translates IPv4 packets received from the
   LAN side to 4rd Border Relays (BR).  BRs have anycast IPv6 addresses
   and receive encapsulated/translated packets from CEs over a virtual
   interface. 4rd operation is stateless.  Packets are received/ sent
   independent of each other and no state needs to be maintained.

   4rd as defined in [I-D.ietf-softwire-map] and [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd]
   is unicast only.  It does not support multicast.  In this document we
   specify how multicast from home IPv4 users can be supported in 4rd.

   In case IPv6 network is multicast enabled, 4rd can provide multicast
   service to the hosts using 4rd Multicast Translation based solution.
   A Multicast Translator can be used that receives IPv6 multicast group
   management messages in MLD and generates corresponding IPv4 group
   management messages in IGMP and sends them to IPv4 network in 4rd
   Border Relay.  We use [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] for sending IPv6
   multicast data in IPv4 to the CE routers.  At 4rd CE router another
   translator is needed to translate IPv6 multicast data into IPv4
   multicast data.

   In case of 4rd variants that use encapsulation such as MAP-E we
   integrate 4rd multicast into the MAP-E tunnel resulting in a
   multicast tunneling protocol.  Multicast tunneling protocol has the
   advantage of not requiring multicast enabled IPv6 network between CE
   routers and MAP (4rd) BRs.

   When MAP-E CE router receives an IGMP join message to an Any-Source
   Multicast (ASM) [RFC1112] or Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) group
   [RFC4607], it sends an aggregated IGMP membership report message in
   the IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel to the border relay.  MAP-E BR joins the
   source in the multicast infrastructure and sends multicast data
   downstream to all member CEs in the IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel.  When a CE
   has no membership state, i.e. after all member hosts leave the
   group(s), its state with the BR expires and the CE can send the next
   join message in anycast.

   In this document we address 4rd multicast problem and propose two
   architectures: Multicast Tunneling and Multicast Translation based
   solutions.  Section 2 is on terminology, Section 3 is on
   requirements, Section 4 is on architecture, Section 5 is on multicast
   translation protocol, Section 6 is on multicast tunneling protocol

   and Section 7 states security considerations.


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-map], [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd], [RFC3810] and
   [RFC3376].


3.  Requirements

   This section states requirements on 4rd multicast support protocol.

   IPv4 hosts connected to 4rd CE router MUST be able to join multicast
   groups in IPv4 and receive multicast data.

   Any source multicast (ASM) SHOULD be supported and source specific
   multicast (SSM) MUST be supported.

   In case of translation solution, 4rd CE MUST support IGMP to MLD
   translation. 4rd CE MUST be MLD Proxy as defined in [RFC4605].

   In case of translation solution, 4rd BR MUST support MLD Querier. 4rd
   BR MUST support MLD to IGMP translator upstream.

   MAP (4rd) CE MAY support IGMP Proxy as defined in [RFC4605].

   MAP (4rd) BR MAY support IGMP router downstream. 4rd BR may support
   PIM protocol upstream.


4.  Architecture

   In 4rd, there are hosts (possibly IPv4/ IPv6 dual stack) served by
   4rd Customer Edge device.  CE is dual stack facing the hosts and IPv6
   only facing the network or WAN side. 4rd CE may be local IPv4 Network
   Address and Port Translation (NAPT) box [RFC3022] by assigning
   private IPv4 addresses to the hosts. 4rd CEs in the same domain may
   use shared public IPv4 addresses on their WAN side and if they do
   they should avoid ports outside of the allocated port set for NAPT
   operation.  At the boundary of the network there is 4rd Border Relay.
   BR receives IPv4 packets tunneled in IPv6 from CE and decapsulates
   them and sends them out to IPv4 network.

   Unicast 4rd is stateless except for the local NAPT at the CE.  Each
   IPv4 packet sent by CE treated separately and different packets from
   the same CE may go to different BRs or CEs.  CE encapsulates IPv4

   packet in IPv6 with destination address set to BR address (usually
   anycast IPv6 address).  BR receives the encapsulated packet and
   decapsulates and send it to IPv4 network.  CEs are configured with
   domain 4rd Prefixes, IPv6 Prefixes and with an BR IPv6 anycast
   address.  BR receives IPv4 packets addressed to this ISP and from the
   destination address it extracts the destination host's IPv4 address
   and uses this address as destination address and encapsulates the
   IPv4 packet in IPv6 and sends it to IPv6-only network.

4.1.  4rd Translation Architecture

   In case IPv6 only network is multicast enabled, translation multicast
   architecture can be used.  CE implements IGMP Proxy function
   [RFC4605] towards the LAN side and MLD Proxy on its WAN interface.
   IPv4 hosts send their join requests (IGMP Membership Report messages)
   to CE.  CE as a MLD proxy sends aggregated MLD Report messages
   upstream towards BR.  CE replies MLD membership query messages with
   MLD membership report messages based on IGMP membership state in the
   IGMP/MLD proxy.

   BR is MLD querier on its WAN side.  On its interface to IPv4 network
   BR may either have IGMP client or PIM.  PIM being able to support
   both IPv4 and IPv6 multicast should be preferred.  BR receives MLD
   join requests, extracts IPv4 multicast group address and then joins
   the group upstream, possibly by issuing a PIM join message.

   IPv4 multicast data received by the BR as a leaf node in IPv4
   multicast distribution tree is translated into IPv6 multicast data by
   the translator using [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] and then sent downstream
   to the IPv6 part of the multicast tree to all downstream routers that
   are members.  IPv6 data packet eventually gets to the CE.  At the CE,
   a reverse [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] operation takes place by the
   translator and then IPv4 multicast data packet is sent to the member
   hosts on the LAN interface.  [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] is modified to
   handle multicast addresses.

   In order to support SSM, IGMPv3 MUST be supported by the host, CE and
   BR.  For ASM, BR MUST be the Rendezvous Point (RP).

   4rd Translation Multicast solution uses the multicast 46 translator
   in not one but two places in the architecture: at the CE router and
   at the Border Relay.  IPv4 multicast data received at 4rd BR goes
   through a [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] header-mapping into IPv6 multicast
   data at the BR and another [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] header-mapping
   back to IPv4 multicast data at the CE router.  Encapsulation variant
   of [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] is not used.

   All the elements of 4rd translation-based multicast support system

4.2.  Encapsulation Multicast Architecture

   Encapsulation variant of MAP (4rd) (MAP-E) network lends itself
   easily to the Multicast Tunneling architecture.  Dual stack hosts are
   connected to the Customer Edge router and it is multicast enabled.
   It is assumed that IPv6 only network is the unicast only network.  At
   the boundary of the network MAP (4rd) Border Relay is connected to
   the native multicast backbone infrastructure.

   We place IGMP Proxy at the CE router.  CE router serves all the
   connected hosts.  For multicast traffic, CE Router uses MAP (4rd)
   tunneling interface with MAP (4rd) BR to send/receive IGMP messages
   using IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel [RFC2473].

   MAP (4rd) BR is IGMP Router towards the CEs and it could be IGMP
   Router or PIM router upstream.  A given relay and all CEs connected
   to it can be considered to be on a separate logical link.  On this
   link, gateways and relay communicate using IPv4-in-IPv6 tunneling to
   transmit and receive multicast control messages for membership
   management and multicast data from the relay to the gateways.

   All the elements of MAP (4rd) multicast support system with tunneling
   are shown in Figure 2.

5.  4rd Translation Multicast Operation

   In this section we specify how the host can subscribe and receive
   IPv4 multicast data from IPv4 content providers based on the
   architecture defined in Figure 1 in two parts: address translation
   and protocol translation.

5.1.  Address Translation

   IPv4-only H1 will join IPv4 multicast group by sending IGMP
   Membership Report message upstream towards the IGMP Proxy in
   Figure 1.  MLD Proxy first creates a synthesized IPv6 address of IPv4
   multicast group address using IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address
   format [I-D.ietf-mboned-64-multicast-address-format].  ASM_MPREFIX64
   for any source multicast groups and SSM_MPREFIX64 for source specific
   multicast groups are used.  Both are /96 prefixes.

   In both ASM_MPREFIX64 and SSM_MPREFIX64, M bit MUST be set to 1 to
   indicate that an IPv4 address is embedded in the last 32 bits of the
   multicast IPv6 address.  ASM_MPREFIX64 values are formed by setting
   flgs bits to make it an embedded RP prefix by setting R bit to 1 and
   P and T bits to 1 as shown in Figure 3 [RFC4291], [RFC3306],
   [RFC3956].

     |   8    |  4 |  4 |  4 |             76               |    32    |

   prefix.  CE (MLD Proxy in CE) can learn this value by means out of
   scope with this document.  With this, CE can easily create an IPv6
   multicast address from the IPv4 group address a.b.c.d that the host
   wants to join.

   Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) can also be supported similar to the
   Any Source Multicast (ASM) described above.  In case of SSM, IPv4
   multicast addresses use 232.0.0.0/8 prefix.  IPv6 SSM_MPREFIX64
   values are formed by setting R bit to zero, P and T bits to 1.  This
   gives FF3x00008x::/96 as the SSM prefix.  This prefix is referred to
   as SSM_PREFIX64 Figure 4.

     |   8    |  4 |  4 |    16     |  4 |       60         |    32    |

     |11111111|0011|scop|00.......00|1000|   sub-group-id   |v4 address|
     +--------+----+----+-----------+----+------------------+----------+

                     Figure 4: SSM_MPREFIX64 Formation

   Since SSM translation requires a unique address for each IPv4
   multicast source, an IPv6 unicast prefix must be configured to the
   translator in the upstream BR to represent IPv4 sources.  This prefix
   is prepended to IPv4 source addresses in translated packets.

   The join message from the host for the group ASM_MPREFIX64:a.b.c.d or
   SSM_MPREFIX64:a.b.c.d or an aggregate join message will be received
   by MLD querier at the BR.  BR as multicast anchor checks the group
   address and recognizes ASM_MPREFIX64 or SSM_MPREFIX64 prefix.  It
   next checks the last 32 bits is an IPv4 multicast address in range
   224/8 - 239/8.  If all checks succeed, IGMPv4 Client joins a.b.c.d
   using IGMP on its IPv4 interface.

   Joining IPv4 groups can also be done using PIM since PIM supports
   both IPv4 and IPv6.  The advantage of using PIM is that there is no
   need to enable IGMP support in neighboring IPv4 routers.  The
   advantage of using IGMP is that IGMP is a simpler protocol and it is
   supported by a wider range of routers.  The use of PIM or IGMP is
   left as an implementation choice.

5.1.1.  Learning Multicast  Prefixes for IPv4-embedded IPv6 Multicast
        Addresses

   CE can be pre-configured with Multicast Prefix64 of ASM_MPREFIX64 and
   SSM_MPREFIX64 that are supported in their network.  However
   automating this process is also desired.
   [I-D.wing-behave-learn-prefix] suggests several methods including
   DHCPv6.

   A new DHCPv6 option, OPTION_AFT_PREFIX_DHCP, can be defined for this
   purpose.  The option contains IPv6 ASM and SSM prefixes.  The host
   can request these prefixes by sending this option in its request to
   the DHCP server and the server replies with the option containing the
   prefixes.

   After the host gets the multicast prefixes, when an application in
   the host wishes to join an IPv4 multicast group the host MUST use
   ASM_MPREFIX64 or SSM_MPREFIX64 and then obtain the synthesized IPv6
   group address before sending MLD join message.

5.2.  Protocol Translation

   The hosts will send their subscription requests for IPv4 multicast
   groups upstream to the default router, i.e.  Costumer Edge device.
   After subscribing the group, the host can receive multicast data from
   the CE.  The host implements IGMP protocol's host part.

   Customer Edge device is IGMP Proxy facing the LAN interface.  After
   receiving the first IGMP Report message requesting subscription to an
   IPv4 multicast group, a.b.c.d, MLD Proxy in the CE's WAN interface
   synthesizes an IPv6 multicast group address corresponding to a.b.c.d
   and sends an MLD Report message upstream to join the group.

   When CE is a NAT or NAPT box assigning private IPv4 addresses to the
   hosts, IP Multicast requirements for a Network Address Translator
   (NAT) and a Network Address Port Translator (NAPT) stated in
   [RFC5135] apply to IGMP messages and IPv4 multicast data packets.

   4rd BR as MLD router receives/sends MLD messages on its WAN
   interface. 4rd BR does all corresponding actions on its upstream
   interface connected to IPv4 network in IGMP/PIM in IPv4.  The two
   sides on the BR share MLD membership state.

   When 4rd BR receives IPv4 multicast data for an IPv4 group a.b.c.d it
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] translates/encapsulates IPv4 packet into IPv6
   multicast packet and sends it to IPv6 synthesized address
   corresponding to a.b.c.d using ASM_MPREFIX64 or SSM_MPREFIX64.  The
   header mapping described in [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] Section 4.2
   (using Table 1) is used except for mapping the source and destination
   addresses.  In this document we use the multicast address translation
   described in Section 5.1 and propose it as a complementary
   enhancement to the translation algorithm in [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd].

   The IP/ICMP translation translates IPv4 packets into IPv6 using
   minimum MTU size of 1280 bytes (Section 4.1 in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd]) but this can be changed for multicast.  Path
   MTU discovery for multicast is possible in IPv6 so 4rd BR can perform

   path MTU discovery for each ASM group and use these values instead of
   1280.  For SSM, a different MTU value MUST be kept for each SSM
   channel.  Because of this 8 bytes added by IPv6 fragment header in
   each data packet can be tolerated.

   Since multicast address translation does not preserve checksum
   neutrality, [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] translator/encapsulator at 4rd BR
   must however modify the UDP checksum to replace the IPv4 addresses
   with the IPv6 source and destination addresses in the pseudo-header
   which consists of source address, destination address, protocol and
   UDP length fields before calculating the new checksum.

   IPv6 multicast data must be translated back to IPv4 at the 4rd CE
   (e.g. using Table 2 in Section 4.2 of [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd]).  Such
   a task is much simpler than the translation at 4rd BR because IPv6
   header is much simpler than IPv4 header and IPv4 link on the LAN side
   of 4rd CE is a local link.  The packet is sent on the local link to
   IPv4 group address a.b.c.d for IPv6 group address of ASM_MPREFIX64:
   a.b.c.d or SSM_MPREFIX64:a.b.c.d.

   In case an IPv4 multicast source sends multicast data with the don't
   fragment (DF) flag set to 1, [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] header mapping
   sets the D bit in IPv6 fragment header before sending the packet
   downstream as in Fig. 3 in Section 4.2 of [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd].
   This feature of [I-D.ietf-softwire-4rd] preserves the semantics of DF
   flag at the BR and CE.

   Because 4rd is stateless, Multicast 4rd should stay faithful to this
   as much as possible.  Border Relay acts as the default multicast
   querier for all CEs that have established multicast communication
   with it.  In order to keep a consistent multicast state between a CE
   and BR, CE MUST use the same IPv6 multicast prefixes (ASM_MPREFIX64/
   SSM_REFIX64) until the state becomes empty.  After that point, the CE
   may obtain different values for these prefixes, effectively changing
   to a different 4rd BR.

5.3.  Supporting IPv6 Multicast in 4rd Translation Multicast

   IPv6 multicast can be supported natively in 4rd in case IPv6-only
   network is multicast enabled. 4rd Customer Edge device has MLD Proxy
   function.  Proxy operation for MLD [RFC3810] is described in
   [RFC4605].

   CE receives MLD join requests from the hosts and then sends
   aggregated MLD Report messages upstream towards BR.  No address or
   protocol translation is needed at the CE or at the BR.  IPv6 Hosts in
   4rd domain use any source multicast block FF0X [RFC4291] or source
   specific multicast block FF3X::8000:0-FF3X::FFFF:FFFF for dynamic

   allocation by a host [RFC4607], [RFC3307].

   4rd Border Relay is MLD querier.  It serves all CEs downstream.
   After receiving an MLD join message, BR sends PIM join message
   upstream to join IPv6 multicast group.  Multicast membership database
   is maintained based on the aggregated Reports received from
   downstream interfaces in the multicast tree.

   4rd Border Relay is a Rendezvous Point (RP) for ASM groups.  For SSM,
   BR MUST support MLDv2.

   IPv6 multicast data received from the Single Source Multicast or Any
   Source Multicast sources are replicated according to the multicast
   membership database and the data packets are sent downstream on the
   multicast tree and eventually received by the CEs that have one of
   more members of this multicast group.

   MLD Proxy in the CE receives multicast data then forwards the packet
   downstream.  Each member host receives IPv6 multicast data packet
   from its Layer 2 interface.


6.  Encapsulation Multicast Operation

   When a host (H1, H2 or H3 in Figure 2) wants to join an IPv4
   multicast group, it sends an IGMP report (IGMPv3 report for a source-
   specific group) to CE router.  CE router uses BR's anycast address
   this CE router is configured with.

   CE encapsulates IGMP report messages in IPv6 and sends it over the
   tunnel to BR in anycast.  After CE receives unicast address of BR, it
   sends all subsequent IGMP messages in unicast.

   BR (topologically closest to this CE router) receives the message
   decapsulates it and then lets IGMP router to process it.  Upstream an
   IGMP Join message is sent to subscribe group G or a PIMv4 Join
   message is sent if PIM is supported.  BR establishes membership state
   for group G. BR sends all related IGMP messages to this CE in unicast
   using IPv4-in-IPv6 tunneling.

   CE now has BR's unicast address which it uses to send all multicast
   packets for group G. If CE receives multiple join messages for the
   same group G, CE sends an aggregated join message to BR.  If CE
   receives another join message for a different group G', CE
   encapsulates it and sends it in anycast to the BR.

   After BR receives IGMP Join message it adds the tunnel to the CE in
   its outgoing interface list for the group that the host wants to

   join.  BR will send a join message towards the source of the
   multicast group to build a multicast tree in the native multicast
   infrastructure and becomes a leaf node in the multicast tree.

   As for multicast data, the data packets from the source received at
   the BR will be replicated to all interfaces in it's outgoing
   interface list as well as the tunnel outgoing interface for all
   member CEs.  BR sends multicast data in IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel to the CE
   with the data packet encapsulated.

   CE receives Multicast Data message over the tunnel interface
   associated with the tunnel to BR.  CE forwards the packet IGMP Proxy
   which in its turn forward the message to the outgoing interfaces
   joined by the hosts.


7.  Security Considerations

   4rd Encapsulation Multicast control and data message security can be
   provided by the security architecture, mechanisms, and services
   described in [RFC4301], [RFC4302] and [RFC4303]. 4rd Translation
   Multicast control and data message security are as described in
   [RFC4607] for source specific multicast.


8.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.
