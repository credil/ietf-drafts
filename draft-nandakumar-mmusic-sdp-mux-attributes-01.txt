            A Framework for SDP Attributes when Multiplexing
             draft-nandakumar-mmusic-sdp-mux-attributes-01

Abstract

   Communication sessions in RTCWeb are described and negotiated using
   Session Description Protocol(SDP)[RFC4566] mechanisms.  SDP uses
   attributes to describes specific aspects of such a session.  These
   attributes have different impacts when using varions of multiplexing
   RTP on a single transport layer flow.  The scope of this
   specification is to provide a framework for analyzing the multiplex
   characteristics for SDP attributes and provide multiplexing
   characteristics of existing attributes.

Internet-Draft         SDP Attribute Multiplexing          February 2013


1.  Introduction

   SDP[RFC4566] defines several attributes for describing specific
   aspects of a multimedia session.  Given the number of SDP attributes
   registered with IANA [IANA]and the defining new attributes in the
   future, there is need for future-proof framework to analyze these
   attributes for their applicability in transport multiplexing use-
   cases.  Few proposed schemes for the same are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation] and
   [I-D.ietf-avt-multiplexing-rtp]

   The document starts with providing the motivation for requiring such
   a framework.  This is followed by introduction to the SDP attribute
   analysis framework/procedures, following which several sections
   applies the framework to the SDP attributes registered with IANA
   [IANA]


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Motivation

   The time and complications of setting up ICE [RFC5245] and DTLS-SRTP
   [RFC5763] transports for use by RTP, and conservation of ports, forms
   an requirement to try and reduce the number of transport level flows
   needed.  This has resulted in the definition of ways to multiplex RTP
   over a single transport flow in order to preserve network resources
   such as port numbers.  This imposes further restrictions on
   applicability of these SDP attributes as they are defined today.

   The specific problem is that there are attribute combinations which
   make sense when specified on independent m-lines -- as with classical
   SDP -- that do not make sense when those m-lines are then multiplexed
   over the same transport.  To give an obvious example, ICE permits
   each m-mline to have an independently specified ice-ufrag attribute.
   However, if the media from multiple m-lines is multiplexed over the
   same ICE component, then the meaning of media-level ice-ufrag
   attributes becomes muddled.

   As of today there are close to 180 SDP attributes registered with the
   IANA [IANA] and more will be added in the future.  There is no
   clearly defined procedure to establish the validity/applicability of
   these attribute when used with multiplexing.

4.  SDP Attribute Analysis Framework

   An SDP session description consists of a session-level section
   followed by zero or more media-level sections that could be broken
   down into following high-level categories

   o  Attributes related to media content such as media type, encoding
      schemes, payload types to name a few.
   o  Attributes specifying media transport characteristics like RTP/
      RTCP port, network addresses, QOS and so on.
   o  Attributes Metadata descriptions such as session timing and origin
      information.
   o  Attributes establishing relationships between media streams.

   The proposed framework classifies each attribute into one of the
   following categories:
   NORMAL  Attributes that can be independently specified when
      multiplexing and retain their original semantics .

   BAD  Attributes where multiplexing SHOULD NOT be used if these
      attributes are in use in the SDP.

   IDENTICAL  Attributes that MUST be identical across all the media
      lines being multiplexed.

   SUM  Attributes can be set as they are normally used but software
      using them in a multiplex case, MUST apply the sum of all the
      attributes being multiplexed instead of trying to use each one.
      This is typically used for bandwidth or other rate limiting
      attributes to the underlining transport.

   TRANSPORT  Attributes that can be set normally for multiple items in
      a multiplexed group but the software MUST pick just one of the
      attribute of the given type for use.  The one chosen is the
      attribute associated with the "m=" lines that represents the
      information being used for the transport of the RTP.  Readers are
      advised to refer Section TRANSPORT_EXAMPLE (Section 16) for an
      illustration of this category.

   SPECIAL  Attributes where the text in the draft must be consulted to
      see how they are handled when multiplexing.

   The idea behind these categories is to provide recommendations for
   using the attributes when multiplexing is being used.

   Section 5 analyzes attributes listed in IANA [IANA] grouped under the
   IETF document that defines them.  The "Current" column indicates
   whether the attribute is currently specified as:

   o  S -- Session level
   o  M -- Media level
   o  B -- Both
   o  SR -- Source-level (for a single SSRC)


5.  Analysis of Existing Attributes

5.1.  RFC4566

   RFC4566 [RFC4566] defines the Session Description Protocol (SDP) that
   is intended for describing multimedia sessions for the purposes of
   session announcement, session invitation, and other forms of
   multimedia session initiation

   The Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2 (MRCPv2) allows client
   hosts to control media service resources such as speech synthesizers,
   recognizers, verifiers, and identifiers residing in servers on the
   network.  MRCPv2 is not a "stand-alone" protocol -- it relies on
   other protocols, such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), to
   coordinate MRCPv2 clients and servers and manage sessions between
   them, and the Session Description Protocol (SDP) to describe,
   discover, and exchange capabilities.  It also depends on SIP and SDP
   to establish the media sessions and associated parameters between the
   media source or sink and the media server.  Once this is done, the
   MRCPv2 exchange operates over the control session established above,
   allowing the client to control the media processing resources on the
   speech resource server.  RFC6787 [RFC6787] defines attributes for
   this purpose.

5.15.  RFC6236

   RFC6236 [RFC6236] proposes a new generic session setup attribute to
   make it possible to negotiate different image attributes such as
   image size.  A possible use case is to make it possible for a low-end
   hand- held terminal to display video without the need to rescale the
   image, something that may consume large amounts of memory and
   processing power.  The document also helps to maintain an optimal
   bitrate for video as only the image size that is desired by the
   receiver is transmitted.

5.16.  RFC6285

   RFC6285 [RFC6285] describes a method using the existing RTP and RTP
   Control Protocol (RTCP) machinery that reduces the acquisition delay.
   In this method, an auxiliary unicast RTP session carrying the
   Reference Information to the receiver precedes or accompanies the
   multicast stream.  This unicast RTP flow can be transmitted at a
   faster than natural bitrate to further accelerate the acquisition.
   The motivating use case for this capability is multicast applications
   that carry real-time compressed audio and video.

   Support of this extension is OPTIONAL.  The extension allows

5.33.  RFC6128

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) has an attribute that allows
   RTP applications to specify an address and a port associated with the
   RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) traffic.  In RTP-based source-specific
   multicast (SSM) sessions, the same attribute is used to designate the
   address and the RTCP port of the Feedback Target in the SDP
   description.  However, the RTCP port associated with the SSM session
   itself cannot be specified by the same attribute to avoid ambiguity,
   and thus, is required to be derived from the "m=" line of the media
   description.  Deriving the RTCP port from the "m=" line imposes an
   unnecessary restriction.  RFC6128 [RFC6128] removes this restriction
   by introducing a new SDP attribute.

                        RFC6193 Attribute Analysis

   In the case of session multiplexed with multiple m=lines, this SHOULD
   create only one IPSEC association for all the m=lines.

5.38.  RFC6064

   The Packet-switched Streaming Service (PSS) and the Multimedia
   Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) defined by 3GPP use the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) and Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)
   with some extensions.  RFC6064 [RFC6064] provides information about
   these extensions and registers the RTSP and SDP extensions with IANA.

   independent bit-rate value together with the maximum packet rate can
   then be used to calculate the real bit-rate over the transport
   actually used.

   RFC6679 [RFC6679] specifies how Explicit Congestion Notification

   over UDP, using the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) as a feedback
   mechanism.  It defines a new RTCP Extended Report (XR) block for

   timely reporting of congestion events, and a Session Traversal

8.4.  RFC6642

   In a large RTP session using the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) feedback
   mechanism defined in RFC 4585 [RFC4585], a feedback target may
   experience transient overload if some event causes a large number of
   receivers to send feedback at once.  This overload is usually avoided
   by ensuring that feedback reports are forwarded to all receivers,
   allowing them to avoid sending duplicate feedback reports.  However,
   there are cases where it is not recommended to forward feedback
   reports, and this may allow feedback implosion.  RFC6642 [RFC6642]
   memo discusses these cases and defines a new RTCP Third-Party Loss

10.4.  RFC5956

   RFC5956 [RFC5956] defines the semantics for grouping the associated
   source and FEC-based (Forward Error Correction) repair flows in the
   Session Description Protocol (SDP).  The semantics defined in the
   document are to be used with the SDP Grouping Framework (RFC 5888).
   These semantics allow the description of grouping relationships
   between the source and repair flows when one or more source and/or
   repair flows are associated in the same group, and they provide
   support for additive repair flows.  SSRC-level (Synchronization
   Source) grouping semantics are also defined in this document for
   Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) streams using SSRC multiplexing.

15.1.  RFC5109

   RFC4145 [RFC5109] describes a payload format for generic Forward
   Error Correction (FEC) for media data encapsulated in RTP.  It is
   based on the exclusive-or (parity) operation.  The payload format
   allows end systems to apply protection using various protection
   lengths and levels, in addition to using various protection group
   sizes to adapt to different media and channel characteristics.  It
   enables complete recovery of the protected packets or partial
   recovery of the critical parts of the payload depending on the packet
   loss situation.

                      RFC5109 Payload Format Analysis

   Draft draft-lennox-payload-ulp-ssrc-mux proposes a simple fix to make
   it possible to use ULP with multipelxing and ULP is allowed when used
   with that.


16.  TRANSPORT Category Example

   The example below explains the usage of "TRANSPORT" category for
   RFC4586 "crypto" parameter when SDP Port number based multiplexing is
   performed for audio and video streams.



        v=0
        o=alice 2890844526 2890844527 IN IP4 host.atlanta.example.com
        s=
        c=IN IP4 host.atlanta.example.com
        t=0 0
        a=group:BUNDLE second,first
        m=audio 49172 RTP/AVP 99
        a=mid:one
        a=crypto:1 AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_80
          inline:d0RmdmcmVCspeEc3QGZiNWpVLFJhQX1cfHAwJSoj|2^20|1:32
        a=rtpmap:99 iLBC/8000
        m=video 51374 RTP/AVP 31
        a=mid:two
        a=crypto:1 AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_80
          inline:EcGZiNWpFJhQXdspcl1ekcmVCNWpVLcfHAwJSoj|2^20|1:32
        a=rtpmap:96 H261/90000

   In this example, "a=crypto" attribute is defined for both the audio
   and the video m=lines.The one that MUST be used for the multiplexed
   RTP Session is the one that corresponds to m=line with mid "two" even
   though the audio m=line with mid "one" occurs ahead of it.  This is
   due to BUNDLE grouping semantics
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation] which mandates the values

   from mid occuring first on the a=group:BUNDLE line to be considered
   for seting up the RTP Transport.


17.  IANA Considerations

   TBD

   Future versions of this specification will ask the IANA to expand to
   attribute tables to include an extra column specifying categories
   from this draft.


18.  Security Considerations

   All the attributes which involve security key needs a careful review
   to ensure two-time pad vulnerability is not created
