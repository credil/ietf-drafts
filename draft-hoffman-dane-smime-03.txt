Using Secure DNS to Associate Certificates with Domain Names For S/MIME
                      draft-hoffman-dane-smime-03

Abstract

   S/MIME uses certificates for authenticating and encrypting messages.
   Users want their mail user agents to securely associate a certificate
   with the sender of an encrypted and/or signed message.  DNSSEC
   provides a mechanism for a zone operator to sign DNS information
   directly.  This way, bindings of certificates to users within a
   domain are asserted not by external entities, but by the entities
   that operate the DNS.  This document describes how to use secure DNS
   to associate an S/MIME user's certificate with the intended domain
   name.

   IMPORTANT NOTE: This draft is intentionally sketchy.  It is meant as
   a possible starting point for the DANE WG if it wants to consider
   making a protocol similar to TLSA, as described in
   draft-ietf-dane-protocol, but that applies to S/MIME.  The WG may or
   may not want to adopt such work, or if it does, may want to use a
   very different scheme from the one described here.

Internet-Draft         DNS Cert Linkage for S/MIME            March 2012


1.  Introduction

   S/MIME [RFC5751] messages often contain a certificate.  This
   certificate assists in authenticating the sender of the message and
   can be used for encrypting messages that will be sent in reply.  In
   order for the S/MIME receiver to authenticate that a message is from
   the sender whom is identified in the message, the receiver's mail
   user agent (MUA) must validate that this certificate is associated
   with the purported sender.  Currently, the MUA must trust a trust
   anchor upon which the sender's certificate is rooted, and must
   successfully validate the certificate.

   Some people want a different way to authenticate the association of
   the sender's certificate with the sender without trusting a CA.
   Given that the DNS administrator for a domain name is authorized to
   give identifying information about the zone, it makes sense to allow
   that administrator to also make an authoritative binding between
   email messages purporting to come from the domain name and a
   certificate that might be used by someone authorized to send mail
   from those servers.  The easiest way to do this is to use the DNS.

   [[ More here about additional uses, such as CMS that is not S/MIME
   where the certificates have email addresses for the subject name. ]]

1.1.  Certificate Associations

   [[ Will mostly duplicate the text from Section 1.1 of
   draft-ietf-dane-protocol ]]

1.2.  Securing Certificate Associations

   [[ Will mostly duplicate the text from Section 1.2 of
   draft-ietf-dane-protocol ]]

1.3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document also makes use of standard PKIX, DNSSEC, and S/MIME
   terminology.  See [RFC5280], [RFC4033], [RFC4034], [RFC4035], and
   [RFC5751] respectively, for these terms.

   "SMIMEA" instead of "TLSA". ]]


3.  TLSA RDATA Wire Format

   [[ Mostly copied from draft-ietf-dane-protocol. ]]


4.  TLSA RR Presentation Format

   [[ Mostly copied from draft-ietf-dane-protocol]]


5.  TLSA RR Examples

   [[ Similar in format to draft-ietf-dane-protocol, but with very
   different examples, of course. ]]


6.  Domain Names for S/MIME Certificate Associations

   Domain names are prepared for requests in the following manner.

   1.  The user name (the "left-hand side" of the email address, called
       the "local-part" in [RFC2822] and the "local part" in [RFC6530]),
       is encoded with Base32 [RFC4648], to become the left-most label
       in the prepared domain name.  This does not include the "@"
       character that separates the left and right sides of the email
       address.

   2.  The string "_smimecert" becomes the second left-most label in the
       prepared domain name.

   3.  The domain name (the "right-hand side" of the email address,
       called the "domain" in [RFC2822]) is appended to the result of
       step 2 to complete the prepared domain name.

   For example, to request a SMIMEA resource record for a user whose
   address is "chris@example.com", you would use
   "MNUHE2LT._smimecert.example.com" in the request.

   Design note: Encoding the user name with Base32 allows local parts
   that have characters that would prevent their use in domain names.
   For example, a period (".") is a valid character in a local part, but
   would wreak havoc in a domain name.  Similarly, [RFC6530] allows non-
   ASCII characters in local parts, and encoding a local part with non-
   ASCII characters with Base32 renders the name usable in the DNS.

7.  Use of S/MIME Certificate Associations in S/MIME

   [[ Stuff here that sounds like TLSA but is actually about S/MIME
   senders and receivers.  Lots of text lifted from
   draft-ietf-dane-protocol. ]]


8.  Mandatory-to-Implement Features

   [[ Mostly copied from draft-ietf-dane-protocol. ]]


9.  IANA Considerations

   [[ Mostly copied from draft-ietf-dane-protocol but using "SMIMEA"
   instead. ]]


10.  Security Considerations

   DNS zones that are signed with DNSSEC using NSEC for denial of
   existence are susceptible to zone-walking, a mechanism that allow
   someone to enumerate all the names in the zone.  Someone who wanted
   to collect email addresses from a zone that uses SMIMEA might use
   such a mechanism.  DNSSEC-signed zones using NSEC3 for denial of
   existence are significantly less susceptible to zone-walking.
   Someone could still attempt a dictionary attack on the zone to find
   SMIMEA records, just as they can use dictionary attacks on an SMTP
   server to see which addresses are valid.

   S/MIME senders and receivers. ]]
