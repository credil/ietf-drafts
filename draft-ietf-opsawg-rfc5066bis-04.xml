  This document updates RFC 5066.
  It amends that specification by informing the internet community
  about the transition of the EFM-CU-MIB module from the concluded IETF Ethernet
  Interfaces and Hub MIB Working Group to the Institute
  of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.3 working group.
 </t>
</abstract>

<section title="Introduction">
 <t>
  RFC 5066 <xref target="RFC5066"/> defines two MIB modules:
  <list>
   <t>EFM-CU-MIB, with a set of objects for managing 10PASS-TS and
      2BASE-TL Ethernet in the First Mile Copper (EFMCu) interfaces;</t>
   <t>IF-CAP-STACK-MIB, with a set of objects describing cross-connect
      capability of a managed device with multi-layer (stacked)
      interfaces, extending the stack management objects in the
      Interfaces Group MIB and the Inverted Stack Table MIB modules.</t>
  </list>
 </t>
 <t>
  With the conclusion of the <xref target="HUBMIB"/> working group,
  the responsibility for the maintenance and further development of
  a MIB module for managing 2BASE-TL and 10PASS-TS interfaces,
  has been transfered to the
  Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.3
  <xref target="802.3"/> working group.
  The IEEE developed IEEE8023-EFM-CU-MIB
  module, defined in IEEE Std 802.3.1-2011 <xref target="802.3.1"/> and
  based on the EFM-CU-MIB, defined in RFC 5066.
 </t>
 <t>
  The IEEE8023-EFM-CU-MIB and EFM-CU-MIB MIB modules can coexist.
 </t>
 <t>
  Please note that IF-CAP-STACK-MIB module was not transfered to IEEE
  and remains as defined in RFC 5066. This memo provides an updated
  security considerations section for that module, since the original
 < RFC did not list any security consideration for IF-CAP-STACK-MIB.
 </t>
</section>

<section title="The Internet-Standard Management Framework">
 <t>
  For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
  Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to
  section 7 of RFC 3410 <xref target="RFC3410"/>.
 </t>
<!--
 <t>
  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
  termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are
  generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol
  (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms
  defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This
  memo specifies MIB modules that are compliant to the SMIv2, which
  is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 <xref target="RFC2578"/>,
  STD 58, RFC 2579 <xref target="RFC2579"/> and STD 58, RFC
  2580 <xref target="RFC2580"/>.

<section title="Mapping between EFM-CU-MIB and IEEE8023-EFM-CU-MIB">
 <t>
  The initial version of IEEE8023-EFM-CU-MIB, defined in IEEE Std
  802.3.1-2011, has MODULE-IDENTITY of ieee8023efmCuMIB with an object
  identifier allocated under the { org ieee
  standards-association-numbers-series-standards
  lan-man-stds ieee802dot3 ieee802dot3dot1mibs } sub-tree.
 </t>
 <t>
  The EFM-CU-MIB has MODULE-IDENTITY of efmCuMIB with an object
  identifier allocated under the mib-2 sub-tree.
 </t>
 <t>
  The names of the objects in the first version of the IEEE8023-EFM-CU-MIB
  are identical to those in the EFM-CU-MIB. However, since both MIB modules have different
  OID values, they can coexist, allowing the management of the newer
  IEEE MIB-based devices, alongside the legacy IETF MIB-based devices.
 </t>
</section>

<section title="Updating the MIB Modules">
 <t>
  With the transfer of the responsibility for maintenance and further
  development of the EFM-CU-MIB module to the IEEE 802.3 working group,
  the EFM-CU-MIB defined in RFC 5066 becomes the last version of
  that MIB module.
 </t>
 <t> 
  All further development of the EFM Copper Interfaces MIB
  will be done by the IEEE 802.3 working group in the IEEE8023-EFM-CU-MIB
  module. Requests and comments pertaining to EFM Copper Interfaces
  MIB SHOULD be sent to the IEEE 803.3 working group. Currently,
  the mailing list of the IEEE 802.3.1 task force, chartered with MIB development,
  is <xref target="stds-802-3-mib@listserv.ieee.org"/>.
 </t>
 <t>
  The IF-CAP-STACK-MIB remains under IETF control and is
  currently maintained by the <xref target="OPSAWG"/> working group.
 </t>
</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">
<!--
  See https://svn.tools.ietf.org/area/ops/trac/wiki/mib-security
  for the latest recommended boilerplate text
-->
 <t>
  There are no managed objects defined in IF-CAP-STACK-MIB module
  with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
 </t>
 <t>
  Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., those with
  MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
  vulnerable in some network environments since they
  can reveal some configuration aspects of the network interfaces.
 </t>
 <t>
  In particular, ifCapStackStatus and ifInvCapStackStatus can identify
  cross-connect capability of multi-layer (stacked) network
  interfaces, potentially revealing the underlying hardware
  architecture of the managed device.
 </t>
 <t>
  It is thus important to control even GET access to these
  objects and possibly even encrypt the values of these objects when sending
  them over the network via SNMP.
 </t>
 <t>
  SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
  Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
  there is no control as to who on the secure network is
  allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
  in this MIB module.
 </t>
 <t>
  Implementations MUST provide the security features described by the
  SNMPv3 framework (see <xref target="RFC3410"/>), including full support for
  authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
  <xref target="RFC3414"/> with the AES cipher algorithm
  <xref target="RFC3826"/>.
  Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model
  (TSM) <xref target="RFC5591"/> in combination with a secure transport such
  as SSH <xref target="RFC5592"/> or TLS/DTLS <xref target="RFC6353"/>.
 </t>
 <t>
  Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
  RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
  enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
  responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
  instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
  the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
  rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
