      <t>
	The Kerberos 5 network authentication protocol, originally
	specified in RFC1510, can use
	the Data Encryption Standard (DES) for encryption. Almost 30
	years after first publishing DES, the National
	Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) finally withdrew
	the standard in 2005, reflecting a long-established
	consensus that DES is insufficiently secure.
	By 2008, commercial hardware costing
	less than USD 15,000 could break DES keys in
	less than a day on average. DES is long past its sell-by
	date. Accordingly, this document updates RFC1964, RFC4120, and
	RFC4121 to deprecate the use of DES in Kerberos. Because
	RFC1510 (obsoleted by RFC4120) supports only DES, this
	document reclassifies
	RFC1510 as Historic. This document also deprecates the weak
	"export strength" RC4 enctype of RFC4757.

    </section>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	The original specification of the Kerberos 5 network
	authentication protocol <xref target="RFC1510"/> supports only
	the Data Encryption Standard (DES) for encryption. For many
	years, the cryptographic community has regarded DES as
	providing inadequate security. Accordingly, this document
	reclassifies <xref target="RFC1510"/> (obsoleted by <xref
	target="RFC4120"/>) as Historic, and updates current
	Kerberos-related specifications <xref target="RFC1964"/>,
	<xref target="RFC4120"/>, and <xref target="RFC4121"/> to
	deprecate the use of DES in Kerberos. This document also
	deprecates the weak "export strength" RC4 enctype of <xref
	target="RFC4757"/>.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Affected specifications">
      <t>
	The original IETF specification of Kerberos 5 <xref
	target="RFC1510"/> only supports DES for
	encryption. <xref target="RFC4120"/> obsoletes <xref
	target="RFC1510"/> and updates the Kerberos specification to
	include additional cryptographic algorithms, but still permits
	the use of DES. <xref target="RFC3961"/> describes the
	Kerberos cryptographic system and includes support for DES
	encryption types, but it does not specify requirement levels
	for them.
      </t>

      <t>
	The specification of the Kerberos Generic Security Services
	Application Programming Interface (GSS-API) mechanism <xref
	target="RFC1964"/> and its updated version <xref
	target="RFC4121"/> define checksum and encryption mechanisms
	based on DES. With the existence of newer encryption types for
	Kerberos GSS-API defined in <xref target="RFC4121"/>,
	Microsoft's RC4-HMAC based GSS-API mechanism, and MIT's
	DES3, there is no need to support the old DES based integrity
	(SGN) and confidentiality (SEAL) types.
      </t>

      <t>
	<xref target="RFC4757"/> describes the RC4-HMAC encryption
	types used by Microsoft Windows, and allows for a 56-bit
	"export strength" variant. (The character constant "fortybits"
	used in the definition is a historical reference and does not
	refer to the actual key size of the enctype.)
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="DES insecurity">
      <t>
	The insecurity of DES has been evident for many years. The
	National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
	officially withdrew DES in 2005 <xref
	target="DES-Withdrawal"/>, and also announced a transition
	period that ended on May 19, 2007 <xref
	target="DES-Transition-Plan"/>. The IETF has also published
	its position in <xref target="RFC4772"/>, in which the
	recommendation summary is very clear: "don't use DES".
      </t>

      <t>
	In 2006, researchers demonstrated the ability to brute force a
	DES key in an average of less than 9 days using less than EUR
	10,000 worth of hardware <xref target="Break-DES"/>. By 2008,
	a company was offering hardware capable of breaking a DES key
	in less than a day on average <xref target="DES-1day"/> that
	cost less than USD 15,000 <xref	target="DES-crack"/>. Brute
	force key searches of DES will only get faster and
	cheaper. (The aforementioned company markets its device for
	one-click recovery of lost DES keys.) It is clear that it is
	well past time to retire the use of DES in Kerberos.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Recommendations">
      <t>
	This document hereby removes the following RECOMMENDED types from
	<xref target="RFC4120"/>:
	<list style='empty'>
	  <t>Encryption: DES-CBC-MD5(3)</t>
	  <t>Checksums: DES-MD5 (8, named RSA-MD5-DES in <xref target="RFC3961"/>).</t>
	</list>
      </t>

      <t>
	Kerberos implementations and deployments SHOULD NOT implement
	the following single DES encryption types: DES-CBC-CRC(1),
	DES-CBC-MD4(2), DES-CBC-MD5(3) (updates <xref target="RFC4120"/>).
      </t>

      <t>
	Kerberos implementations and deployments SHOULD NOT implement
	the following "export strength" RC4 encryption type:
	RC4-HMAC-EXP(24) (updates <xref target="RFC4757"/>).
      </t>

      <t>
	Kerberos implementations and deployments SHOULD NOT implement
	the following checksum types: CRC32(1), RSA-MD4(2),
	RSA-MD4-DES(3), DES-MAC(4), DES-MAC-K(5), RSA-MD4-DES-K(6),
	RSA-MD5-DES(8) (updates <xref target="RFC4120"/>).
      </t>

      <t>
	It is possible to safely use the RSA-MD5(7) checksum type, but
	only with additional protection, such as the protection that
	an encrypted Authenticator provides. Implementations MAY use
	RSA-MD5 inside an encrypted Authenticator for backward
	compatibility with systems that do not support newer checksum
	types (updates <xref target="RFC4120"/>). One example is that
	some legacy systems only support RC4-HMAC(23) <xref
	target="RFC4757"/> for encryption when DES is not available;
	these systems use RSA-MD5 checksums inside Authenticators
	encrypted with RC4-HMAC.
      </t>

      <t>
	Kerberos GSS mechanism implementations and deployments SHOULD
	NOT implement the following SGN ALG: DES MAC MD5(0000),
	MD2.5(0100), DES MAC(0200) (updates <xref target="RFC1964"/>).
      </t>

      <t>
	Kerberos GSS mechanism implementations and deployments SHOULD
	NOT implement the following SEAL ALG: DES(0000) (updates <xref
	target="RFC1964"/>).
      </t>

      <t>
	The effect of the two last sentences is that this document
	deprecates section 1.2 in <xref target="RFC1964"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
	This document hereby reclassifies <xref target="RFC1510"/> as
	Historic.
      </t>

    <section title="Acknowledgements">

      <t>
	Mattias Amnefelt, Ran Atkinson, Henry Hotz, Jeffrey Hutzelman,
	Leif Johansson, and Simon Josefsson have read the document and
	provided suggestions for improvements. Sam Hartman proposed
	moving <xref target="RFC1510"/> to Historic.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">

      <t>
	Removing support for single DES improves security, because DES is
	considered to be insecure.
      </t>

      <t>
	Kerberos defines some encryption types that are either
	underspecified or that only have number assignments but no
	specifications. Implementations should make sure that they
	only implement and enable secure encryption types.
      </t>

      <t>
	RC4, used in RC4-HMAC, is considered weak; however, the
	use in Kerberos is vetted and considered secure for now. The
	main reason to not actively discourage the use of
	RC4-HMAC is that it is the only encryption type that
	interoperates with older versions of Microsoft Windows once
	DES and RC4-HMAC-EXP are removed.
      </t>
