INTERNET DRAFT     CertInfo single response extension    August 31, 2012

Abstract

   OCSP [RFC2560] has been designed to allow an OCSP server to use 
   any kind of trustable information to answer to a client varying 
   from CRLs to an access to a database of issued certificates. 

   In its original version, OCSP does not allow taking full advantage 
   of an access to a database of issued certificates.

   When a database of issued certificates is used by an OCSP server, 
   this document explains how the OCSP server shall respond and how 
   OCSP clients shall react. 
   
   The proposal is intended to update 2560bis. It defines a new single 
   extension in a single response, called certInfo.  The extension is 
   non critical.  The meaning of "good", "revoked" and "unknown" are 
   unchanged.

INTERNET DRAFT     CertInfo single response extension    August 31, 2012

2. certInfo single extension

   This single extension may be used in singleExtensions within a 
   SingleResponse.  It either contains:

      - an indication that the serial number of the target 
        certificate is not present in the database, or

      - a hash value of the target certificate computed using the 
        value of the certificate that is present in the database. 

   This extension may only be used when an OCSP server has access to 
   a database maintained by a CA which contains, for every issued 
   certificate, the following up-to-date information:

      - its serial number,
      - its revocation status, and 
      - the value of the certificate.

   The use of this single extension is RECOMMENDED, when the server is 
   able to support it.

   The following only applies when this single extension is supported 
   by the OCSP server.

   When the serial number of the target certificate is present in the 
   database, then the OCSP server SHALL indicate the revocation 
   status of the target certificate accordingly to the revocation 
   status indicated in the database and the extension SHALL contain
   a hash value of the target certificate computed using the value of 
   the certificate that is present in the database.   The critical flag 
   SHALL NOT be set.

   When the serial number of the certificate is not present in the 
   database, then the OCSP server SHALL indicate that the revocation 
   status of the target certificate is "unknown" and the extension 
   SHALL contain an indication that the serial number of the target 
   certificate is not present in the database.   The critical flag 
   SHALL NOT be set.

   The identifier for this extension is id-pkix-ocsp-certInfo, 
   while the value is CertInfo.

   id-pkix-ocsp                OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ad-ocsp } 
   id-pkix-ocsp-certInfo       OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix-ocsp 9 }

   CertInfo ::=  CHOICE {
      certSerialNumberUnknown   [0]  BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
      certHashValue             [1]  CertHashValue
   }

   CertHashValue          ::=  SEQUENCE {
       hashAlgorithm           AlgorithmIdentifier,
       hashValue               OCTET STRING
       }

   certSerialNumberUnknown is a Boolean which indicates that the serial 
   number of the target certificate is not present in the list of the 
   certificates issued by the CA to which the OCSP responder has 
   access.  In that case, certStatus SHALL be set to "unknown".

   certHashValue contains a hash value of the target certificate 
   computed using the same hash function that was used by the OCSP 
   client in the CertID field from the OCSP request.

   If this extension is not understood by the OCSP client, then it 
   SHALL be ignored.

   If this extension is understood by the OCSP client, the OCSP 
   client should make sure that there is no mistake with the serial
   number value.  It should also make sure that it holds a certificate 
   which includes that serial number and for which a certification 
   path has been verified valid up to a trusted root (except the 
   revocation status of the target certificate). 

   The processing of this extension by an OCSP client is as follows:

     If the certSerialNumberUnknown Boolean is returned in the single 
     extension, then the CertStatus is necessarily "unknown".  The OCSP 
     client SHOULD use this information to alert the OCSP server using 
     out of bands means.

     If a hash of the certificate is returned in the single extension, 
     the OCSP client SHALL compare its value with a hash computed 
     locally on the target certificate it holds. 

       If the hashes match, then the revocation status of the target 
       certificate, as indicated by the OCSP server, is valid.

       If the hashes do not match, then the OCSP client SHOULD use this 
       information to alert the OCSP server using out of bands means.

3. Text to be placed in the Security Considerations section

X.X. Certificate not regularly issued

   The advantages and the limitations provided through the use of the 
   single extension "CertInfo" are indicated below:

   When certSerialNumberUnknown is returned, this extension indicates:

      - either that the target certificate has indeed not been 
        issued and thus is a forged certificate,

      - or that the target certificate which was indeed regularly 
        issued has been removed from the database by an attacker 
        (denial of service attack) or by accident.

   When certHashValue is returned and the hashes do not match, this 
   extension allows detecting an abnormal situation : there exists two 
   certificates with the same serial number: one regularly issued by 
   the CA and another one which has either been forged or obtained 
   irregularly.

   When certHashValue is returned and the hashes match, then everything 
   looks fine, but this case does not allow detecting an abnormal 
   situation if the RA software has been corrupted or if the database 
   to which the OCSP server has access has been maliciously corrupted. 

   When an OCSP server receives an alert from an OCSP client, it should 
   use the information provided by the OCSP client to investigate the 
   case. 

   If the target certificate is unknown to the OCSP server, but has 
   been regularly issued, it is necessary to discriminate between a 
   denial of service attack or an accident and to correct the problem 
   so that the situation does not persist.

   If the target certificate has not been regularly issued, its serial 
   number should be immediately added by the CA to the list of revoked 
   certificates. 

   Then after, the OCSP server should continue to investigate the case:

     - either the extend of the damage can be evaluated by the CA and 
       only those certificates which have been fraudulently issued 
       shall be revoked by the CA, or 

     - the extend of damage cannot be evaluated and in that case the CA 
       should ask to its superior CA to revoke its CA certificate.

   It is up to the CA and to the OCSP server to cooperate together in 
   order to attempt to recover from these situations.  OCSP servers and 
   CAs should include in their recovery plans, the above situations.
