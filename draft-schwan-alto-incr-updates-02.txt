Abstract

   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to
   bridge the gap between network and applications by provisioning
   network related information.  This allows applications to make
   informed decisions, for example when selecting a target host from a
   set of candidates.

   Therefore an ALTO server provides network and cost maps to its
   clients.  This draft discusses options on how to provide incremental
   updates for these maps, with the goal of reducing the amount of data
   needed for transmitting the maps and shortly evaluates the two most
   promising options.

Internet-Draft          ALTO Incremental Updates               July 2012


1.  Introduction

   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to
   bridge the gap between network and applications by provisioning
   network related information.  This allows applications to make
   informed decisions, for example when selecting a target host from a
   set of candidates.  Typical applications are file sharing, real-time
   communication and live streaming peer-to-peer networks [RFC5693] as
   well as Content Distribution Networks
   [I-D.jenkins-alto-cdn-use-cases].

   The ALTO protocol [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol] is specified as a client-
   server protocol based on the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and
   encoded in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).  An ALTO server
   provides services that guide ALTO clients in their decisions.  The
   Endpoint Property Service allows ALTO clients to look up properties
   of endpoints, for example its Netwok Location.  The Endpoint Cost
   Service allows ALTO server to rank endpoints amongst each other with
   respect to numerical or ordinal costs.  The Map Service and the Map
   Filtering Service allows ALTO client to retrieve full or partial
   Network Maps and the associated Cost Maps that are provisioned by an
   ALTO server.

   The ALTO Network Map contains groupings of endpoints as defined by
   the ALTO server.  By aggregating multiple endpoints that are close to
   one another with respect to their network connectivity a greater
   scalability is achieved.  Each group of endpoints is associated to a
   Network Location identifier called a PID, for example by a list of IP
   prefixes that belong to the PID.  The ALTO Server then indicates
   preferences amongst the PIDs in the Cost Map by defining Path Costs
   amongst sets of Netwok Locations.

   The size of the Network and Cost Maps depend on the granularity of
   the map an ALTO server provides for its clients.  While some use
   cases allow operators to configure their servers to support only a
   small numbers of PIDs, other use cases are expected to require a much
   greater accuracy in terms of network locations.  In order to avoid
   the transmission of the same information in each client request, a
   mechanism that allows a server to send incremental updates, in
   particular for large Network and Cost Maps, is needed.

   The goal of this draft is to list and discuss the different options
   that allow such incremental updates of Network and Cost Maps.  It is
   focused on options that are compatible with the ALTO base protocol
   and encoding, namely HTTP and JSON.  The draft is structured as
   follows: First it lists options that allow a server to validate the
   cached version of a map a client has.  Then it dicsusses several
   options a server has to send incremental updates, including JSON

   Patch and an ALTO extension.  Finally it shortly evaluates two
   promising options.

2.  Problem Statement

   The ALTO protocol uses Network and Cost Maps to allow ALTO servers
   the specification of its own aggregated network view.  Essentially
   the Network Map contains information on how the endpoints are grouped
   together, which is typically done according to their proximity.  The
   Cost Map contains Path Costs between the network regions defined in
   the Network Map. The size of these maps strongly depends on the
   scenario an ALTO server is configured for by its operator.  While in
   some scenarios both maps might only comprise s small number of PIDs,
   others need much greater accuracy.  For large maps partial updates
   might become necessary.

   Both map types have slightly different characteristics.  Network Maps
   in general are expected to be smaller than Cost Maps.  As an example,
   a Network Map with 5,000 PIDs, each having 10 cidrs will result in a
   map with the size of roughly 1.25 megabytes.  A Cost Map in contrast
   contains a n*n matrix for cost entries where n is the number of PIDs.
   Even for short PID names a full cost map for 5,000 PIDs takes up to
   417 megabytes.  Network Maps are also seen to be less dynamic than
   Cost Maps.  This is due to the fact that the topology an ALTO server
   sees changes slower than the path costs of the network.  Another
   characteristic is that changes to the Network Map will impact the
   Cost Map, whereas vice versa this is presumably not the case.  A
   final discussion on whether partial updates are useful for both map
   types is out of the scope of this document.

   The remainder of this document discusses options to allow partial
   updates of Network and Cost Maps.  Therefore two sections focus on
   two separate problems that need a solution.  The first part
   (Section 3) discusses how an ALTO client and an ALTO server can
   synchronize their map state without transmitting the whole map.  This
   is needed to identify whether a partial update can be applied and
   also to calculate the partial update itself.  The second part
   (Section 4) of the document discusses how partial updates can be
   encoded and sent to the client.  The final section gives a numerical
   evaluation of proposed incremental update options.

3.  Determine Client Map Version

   To allow a server sending incremental updates to a client it first
   needs to check the version of a cached map a client already has.  In
   this section we discuss options for this validation.  We focus our
   discussion on approaches where the client polls the ALTO server for
   map changes and the server decides based on the client request.
   Therefore we first discuss HTTP built-in options and follow-up with a
   possible extension to ALTO network and cost maps themselves.

3.1.  HTTP

   HTTP [RFC2616] provides request-header fields to express conditional
   requests.  Typically these conditional requests are used by caches to
   decide whether a copy of a resource they have can be served to a
   requesting client directly or not.  Responses to conditional HTTP
   requests must be exactly the same as for normal HTTP GET requests.
   Thus sending a modified map version (i.e. a partial update) violates
   the HTTP standard.  Conditional requests can still be used to avoid
   transmitting an unchanged Map multiple times.  The options are
   discussed in the following.

3.1.1.  If-Modified-Since HTTP Header

   One possible option is to use the HTTP If-Modified-Since header in
   the request if the client has previously contacted the ALTO service
   and thus already has a version of the map.  Therefore the server
   includes date and time when the map was last modified into the Last-
   Modified entity-header for a particular map, which is cached by the
   client together with the map and sends it in new requests for the
   same map in the If-Modified-Since header.

   The following figure illustrates a GET request for a Network Map
   Information Resource.  Additionally the client indicates the time
   when it retrieved the Network Map the last time in the If-Modified-
   Since header field.

    GET /networkmap HTTP/1.1
    Host: alto.example.com
    Accept: application/alto-networkmap+json,application/alto-error+json
    If-Modified-Since: Sat, 24 Dec 2011 19:43:31 GMT

                  Figure 1: If-Modified-Since HTTP Header

   A server retrieving this request uses the timestamp provided by the
   client to decide whether to send a full map or no map at all in case
   there were no changes.  In case the Network Map has not been modified
   since the time provided by the client in the request, the server

   SHOULD reply with a 304 HTTP response.  The client then caches the
   updated value of the Last-Modified entity-header for future requests.

       304 Not Modified
       Last-Modified: Sun, 25 Dec 2011 09:33:31 GMT

                        Figure 2: HTTP Response 304

   In case the server determines that the timestamp provided by the
   client is out-of-date it must return the full Network Map, as defined
   in the ALTO core protocol specification.  The following figure shows
   the Last-Modified entity-header in the HTTP response that is used as
   a timestamp for the map as well as the ETag header for a If-None-
   Match request, as explained in section Section 3.1.2.

        }
      }

3.1.2.  If-None-Match HTTP Header

   A second HTTP based mechanism could employ ETags in combination with
   the If-None-Match header.  Here the server creates entity tags that
   identify the version of a map.  A client that caches a map includes
   this identifier in every future request.  The server can use this
   ETag to identify whether a cached map version is up-to-date.

   The following example illustrates a client GET request which includes
   an ETag, identifying a network map.  The example assumes the client
   received the Network Map response in Figure 3.

                    Figure 4: If-None-Match HTTP Header

3.2.  Version-based incremental updates as ALTO extension

   With this approach, clients poll the ALTO server for changes.  The
   server provides hints as to the polling frequency.  We propose two
   different mechanisms in the ALTO message format, one for network-map
   changes, the other for cost-map changes.

   For network-map changes, add a new GET-mode request, "CURRENT NETWORK
   MAP VTAG."  The response is short and simple: just the current map-
   vtag and a hint about how often the network-map might change.  Once a
   client has the full network map, the client periodically sends that
   CURRENT VTAG request to the server.  If the map-vtag changes, the
   client re-gets the network map.  For cost-map changes, add two new
   fields to the full cost-map response: a "cost-map-vtag" and a hint
   about the how often the server updates the cost map.

   Using these vtags both client and server can determine if it is
   necessary to request or to send an updated map, a full map, or if the
   current version is still up-to-date.

3.2.1.  CURRENT NETWORK MAP vtag

   This is a GET-mode request.  The response is a simple json structure
   with

   o  The current map-vtag for the network map.

   o  The average number of seconds between changes to the network map.

   It needs a new media type, say application/alto-currentmapvtag+json

   For example,

4.  Incremental Update Options

   Once a server has decided to send a partial update, there are several
   ways to do so.  This section discusses these response options.

4.1.  Send entire map

   One trivial option is always to send the entire map anyways.  The
   advantage of sending the whole map typically is that there is no
   computational effort needed on the server side.  Thus this can always
   be a fallback in case the server is under load, or in case a partial
   update appears to be inefficient.

4.2.  Patch map

   A server that knows the version of the map a client currently has can
   use this information to calculate the contextual diff to the newest
   version of the map.  This can also be done in a batch process for all
   previous versions once a new map is loaded on the server to avoid a
   per request calculation.  The diff output can then be sent in a
   response to the client, which in turn can use it to patch its version
   of the map.  By doing this the newest version of the map can be
   recreated.

4.3.  Encode map

   One major goal of applying partial updates is to reduce transmission
   time by reducing the amount of data which is to be transferred to the
   client.  This goal can be achieved by applying compression
   techniques, such as gzip, to the message content, both for partial
   updates as well as for entire maps.

   HTTP supports this by the Content-Encoding entity header field.  The
   advantage of using compression is that there is no need to change the
   underlying media-type of the response.  Typically not all ALTO
   clients will support this optimization from the beginning, thus the
   server will need to store two representations of the maps: One which
   is compressed and one uncompressed.

4.4.  HTTP Range Retrieval

   The HTTP Range header allows a client to request only a subset of a
   resource.  This is useful for quick recovery of partially failed
   transfers.  Using this option for incremental updates of ALTO Maps
   difficult.  The Byte range is specified by the client, however the
   diff is calculated by the server.  Thus an additional mechanism would
   be needed tell the client which byte sequences to request to.
   Additionally the Byte offsets might change between Map versions, thus

   this option appears to be error-prone.

4.5.  JSON patch

   JSON Patch [I-D.pbryan-json-patch] defines a JSON document structure
   that allows partial modifications to a JSON document and defines the
   associated media type "application/json-patch".  Therefore JSON Patch
   is a suitable option for incremental updates of the Network and Cost
   Maps.  JSON patch supports add, remove and replace operations that
   can be used in combination with JSON Pointers
   [I-D.pbryan-zyp-json-pointer] to modify values and arrays of the JSON
   document members.

   Typically JSON Patch is used in combination with the HTTP PATCH
   method [RFC5789] to partially modify existing resources on a server.
   As an ALTO client is not modifying a resource, but wants to be
   updated if the resource has changed it needs to signal to the server
   that it is able to receive and understand JSON Patch updates.  This
   can be done by including the media type "application/json-patch" in
   the Accept header field of the HTTP request.

   Although JSON Patch permits pointers to index individual array
   elements, that's potentially ambiguous.  "Add" and "delete" change
   the array indexes; do subsequent updates to that array refer to the
   original indexes or the revised indexes?  And even if that's well-
   specified, it's a potential source of error.  Furthermore, some
   clients may store the CIDRs in a PID as a set, rather than an array,
   so they don't keep the original index numbers.

   To avoid these problems, we recommend that when updating the CIDRs
   for a PID, the server replaces the full array value for that PID,
   rather than updating individual CIDRs by index.

   This may also simplify the server, because it just has to flag the
   PID as having changed; it doesn't have to remember the previous
   sequence of CIDRs.

   The following figure illustrates one example where the server decides
   to send a partial update to the client using JSON Patch.  The server
   indicates this in the response Content-Type header.  In the following
   example the Network Map from the example in Figure 3 above has
   changed.  The map-vtag element has been incremented by 1, which
   results in a replace operation for the respective element containing
   the new value.  Also two new subnets are added to the Network Map in
   PID1 and PID2 by two replace operations on the ipv4 arrays.

                 Figure 7: Partial update with JSON Patch

   One benefit of using JSON Patch for partial updates would be if
   standard JSON parsers would implement JSON Patch already.  This would
   allow ALTO protocol implementers to reuse existing functionality.
   However to the knowledge of the authors there are only few
   implementations supporting JSON Patch to date, and a widespread
   adoption is still outstanding and will presumably take some time.

4.6.  ALTO Incremental Update service

   Another option is to offer a dedicated ALTO service for partial
   updates.  A client that determines that its current map is out-of-
   date, for example by comparing cost-map-vtag values (see Section 3.2)
   can then query this service to retrieve the partial update.  This
   section defines this service in the next section and an new
   capability for the IRD in the following section

4.6.1.  Incremental Update messages

   This service can be implemented in new POST-mode requests, Get
   Network Map Updates and Get Cost Map Updates.  These partial update
   messages use a new MIME type [RFC2046]:

      "application/alto-update-param+json"

   The client includes its current map version (i.e. the map-vtag or the
   cost-map-vtag) to the post data of the request in a new reference tag
   field.  Based on this reference-tag a partial update response is
   created.  Or if the current (cost-)map-vtag is the same as the
   reference-tag -- that is, if there are no changes -- the "map" entry
   in the response has no entries.  Or if it's sufficiently old that the
   server no longer knows what changed since that version or if the tag
   is invalid, the server returns a complete cost map.  Thus the
   response contains an optional field to allow clients to distinguish:

Internet-Draft          ALTO Incremental Updates               July 2012


      {"full-map": true}

   Thus the response MUST have costs that changed since the specified
   version, but MAY have other costs as well.

   The partial update response essentially is a Filtered Network Map or
   Filtered Cost Map message, where for a Network Map for each PID in
   the message, previous CIDRs are replaced with new CIDRs in case they
   have changed.  To remove a PID from the Map the value "delete" or an
   empty array is used.  PIDs that are not in the message remain
   unchanged.  Similarly for Cost Maps, costs specified in the message
   replace previous costs for the respective source/destination PIDs.
   Again, to remove a cost the value "delete" (or "-1", or "NaN",...) is
   used whereas costs that are not in the message stay the same.

   The following figures give one example of a request/response
   transaction of the proposed Partial Update ALTO extension service.


        POST /partialupdate/costmap/rcost/incrementalupdate/costmap

4.6.2.  Incremental Update Capability

   An ALTO server needs to advertise its ability of providing
   incremental updates to a client.  One option of doing this is by
   including an ALTO information resource capability indicating the
   partial update option.  This can be done per ALTO service, which
   allows a fine grained control over which URIs handle partial
   requests.

   The following Information Resource Directory illustrates one example
   where network and costmaps are available with and without partial
   update option respectively.  This is expressed by the JSONBool
   capability element "partial-update".

5.  Numerical Evaluation

   In this section we provide a numerical evaluation of the efficiency
   of incremental updates.  We focus on the two most promising
   approaches JSON patch (Section 4.5) and the ALTO incremental Updates
   service (Section 4.6).  For our calculations we use cost map formats
   to conclude on the incremental update efficiency.

5.1.  Full Cost Map Size estimation

   In the following we estimate the size of full cost maps with respects
   to the number of PIDs that are contained.  Neglecting some fixed
   overhead we find:

      np^2 * (4 + pl + cl) + np * (6 + pl)

   where

      np: number of PIDS

      pl: Average length of PID names

      cl: Average number of digits in costs

   If we assume PID names are 8 characters (pl = 8) and costs are 3
   digits (cl = 3), we get:

               np    cost-map size
               10        1,640
               25        9,725
               50       38,200
              100      151,400
              250      941,000
              500    3,757,000
             1000   15,014,000
             2500   93,785,000
             5000  375,070,000

                      Figure 11: Full Cost Map Sizes

   As a conclusion we do think that for less than 100 PIDs incremental
   updates are not needed.  Instead the Full Cost Map can be sent.
   However for Maps that require a greater accuracy and thus a higher
   number of PIDs incremental updates are required.

5.2.  JSON Patch vs. ALTO extension

   In this section we estimate the performance of JSON Patch and the
   proposed ALTO extension.  We limit our estimation on the worst-case
   scenario, which are replace operations.

   For each changed cost a JSON Patch replace operation is represented
   by the following encoding:

      { "replace": "meta.data.map.SRC-PID.DEST-PID", "value": 123 },

   Whereas an Incremental Update ALTO Cost Map message as defined in
   this document takes an encoding of (Note: This is actually the
   encoding of the existing ALTO Cost Map response - it's just a matter
   of interpretation):

      "SRC-PID": {"DEST-PID": 123},

   Note that this is the worst case, it takes less space if several
   updates share the same source PID:

      "SRC-PID": {"DEST-1": 123, "DEST-2": 321, ....},

   The number of bytes per changed cost are:

   JSON patch:
         33 + 2*NameLength + CostLength

   ALTO Cost Map Message (worst case):
         8 + 2*NameLength + CostLength

   We estimate the number of bytes for:

   JSON patch:
         cf * np * np * (33 + pl + cl)

   ALTO Cost Map Message (worst case):
         cf * np * np * (8 + pl + cl)

   where

      cf: Fraction of src-dest costs that changed (0 to 1)

      np: Number of PIDS

      pl: Average length of PID names

      cl: Average number of digits in costs

   If we assume PID names are 8 characters (pl = 8) and costs are 3
   digits (cl = 3), and 5% of the costs change (cf = .05), we get:


                      JSON   ALTO Cost
            np       patch  Map message
            10         220          95
            50       5,500       2,375
           100      22,000       9,500
           250     137,500      59,375
           500     550,000     237,500
          1000   2,200,000     950,000
          2500  13,750,000   5,937,500

             Figure 12: Results JSON Patch vs. ALTO extension

   Clearly, the ALTO extension as proposed in this document has a higher
   efficiency in terms of encoded bytes needed compared to JSON Patch.

8.  Conclusion

   This document describes different options that can be applied to
   support incremental updates of ALTO Network and Cost maps.  In
   particular it comprises option for client and server to synchronize
   themselves about their current map state, and further includes
   options on how to encode partial updates.  Finally it proposes an new
   incremental update service and evaluates different options
   numerically.
