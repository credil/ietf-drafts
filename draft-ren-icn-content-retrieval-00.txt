                   draft-ren-icn-content-retrieval-00

Abstract

   Information-Centric Network(ICN), as an emerging network
   architecture, focus on delivering content more efficiently.  This
   brief paper discusses some issues about content retrieval in the
   Information-Centric Network.  It first lists a set of basic
   requirements on the basis of previous literatures.  Then, it tries to
   identify the fundamental functionalities required to satisfy the
   foregoing requirements.  Last, it summarizes the implementation
   status of such functionalities in various Information-Centric Network
   architectures.

1.  Introduction

   Information-Centric Network (also known as content-oriented network
   [CON], data-oriented network [DON], or name-based network [NBN]) is a
   new communication paradigm which puts the content at the center of
   the network architecture.  It is motivated by the mismatch between
   the increasing demand for highly scalable and efficient distribution
   of content and inefficiently content delivery of the traditional
   host-centric communication paradigm.

   Content distribution, including file sharing and media streaming, has
   contributed to the ever-increasing Internet traffic nowadays.
   Content consumers, in general, are more concerned about what content
   they want than where that content resides.  Unfortunately, current
   Internet is based on a host-centric communication paradigm where a
   consumer has to specify where the content is and the network only can
   deliver the content from the specified source to the consumer.
   Moreover, it is usually difficult to exploit many superior
   technologies, such as multicast, k-anycast, etc.

   To overcome the aforementioned issues, several Information-Centric
   Network designs have been proposed.  In these designs, each content
   is given a unique name which is not associated with its location.
   Consumers can use the content name to request the content which they
   intend to get.  More importantly, all the routings are based on the
   content name, which enables the request to be routed to any potential
   content sources.  Moreover, many technologies, including content
   replication, caching, k-anycast etc., can now be used to achieve
   faster content retrieval.

   Although the Information-Centric Network is considered as a promising
   way to solve the aforementioned issues, ICN is still a work in
   progress and there is a long way to go for standardizing it.  This
   paper tries to list a set of basic requirements and fundamental
   functionalities for content retrieval in ICN.  We hope this work will
   benefit the design of ICN.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Content original provider: an end entity that publishes and provides
   the content.

   Content consumer: an end entity that wants to retrieve a content.

   Content holder: any entity that has a complete copy of the content
   (including provider, router, cache, and other devices which hold the
   content).

   Content name: every content is given a unique name.  Content consumer
   requests the content by specifying its name rather than its location.


3.  Requirements of content retrieval

   To provide efficient content delivery, several requirements should be
   satisfied:

   1.  Persistency and unique content name.  Each content should be
   given a unique name.  This name should be valid as long as the
   corresponding content is available.  In other words, the content name
   should not be changed no matter where it is.

   2.  Availability.  Availability means the content should be reachable
   at all times with low-latency.  Replication can be used to guarantee
   availability, and the network is responsible for finding the nearby
   copies which have low-latency.

   3.  Failure recovery.  End-to-end communication is often disrupted
   due to the endpoint mobility and link/router failure.  These
   disruptions should not disturb the content delivery.

   4.  Authenticity.  Any communication entities, including router, end-
   device, application, etc., can verify whether the content comes from
   the authenticated source.

   5.  Bandwidth efficiency.  Since the volume of content is huge,
   appropriate technologies should be used to minimize bandwidth
   consumption.


4.  Fundamental functionalities for content retrieval

   The requirements listed above are the most important ones.  More
   requirements will be added further.  To satisfy these requirements,
   several fundamental functionalities should be provided:

   1.  Content name resolution.  Name resolution service translates
   content name into network location.  In ICN, multiple content holders
   can provide the same content.  The requests should be directed to the
   intended content holder according to some policies, such as lowest
   delivery latency, minimum bandwidth utilization, etc.

Internet-Draft      Report of NAT Reveal TCP Options        October 2012


   2.  K-anycast.  K-anycast is a communication model which allows K
   servers to cooperate with each other to accomplish content delivery.
   With k-anycast, the network can deliver the content much faster and
   provide quick failure recovery.

   3.  Multicast.  Multicast can be used to deliver content to all the
   content consumers interested in the content.  It can effectively save
   the network bandwidth.

   4.  Content replication.  Content can be stored in end-hosts
   according to some off-line replication policies.  Well-designed
   replication policy can reduce the content retrieval time.

   5.  In-network cache discovery.  In-network caching is considered as
   one of the most significant properties of ICN.  To fully utilize the
   caches, however, the network needs a mechanism to discover the
   caches.


5.  Summary

   This section summarizes the implementation status of the
   aforementioned fundamental functionalities in different ICN projects.
   In this draft, EU FP7 projects, US NSF projects and some academic
   projects are compared.
