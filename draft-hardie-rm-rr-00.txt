Internet-Draft                  The RM RR                     March 2012


1.  Introduction

   For the purposes of this document, a limited reachability domain
   (LRD) is a network segment, overlay network, or bounded network whose
   nodes are not generally reachable outside an administratively
   controlled domain.  Enterprise networks are common examples.  Many
   limited reachability domains use private address space or unrouted
   space.

   A reachability method in this context is a mechanism that provides
   access to a limited reachability domain from outside the usual
   administrative boundary.  This document expresses reachability
   methods by designating the host, port, and protocol used for access,
   using a URI.  Note that few reacahability methods currently have
   registered URI schemes, so effective deployment may be gated by the
   development of an effective set of interoperable designations of
   these schemes.

   A common method for providing access to limited reachability domain
   is the point-to-multipoint virtual private network.  VPNs in
   enterprise contexts commonly provide a single tunnel end point per
   client, configured at set-up.  Once the tunnel has successfully
   connected, the client gets access to the internal network's full
   resources, including the internal view of any split DNS.  Though
   effective, this method generally either limits the granularity of
   security (to what is often called a "crunchy on the outside, soft in
   the middle" approach) or requires additional configuration by the
   network operations team to limit reachability further after the
   clients have traversed the tunnel.  Even in the cases where such
   additional configuration is completed (by assigning different VPN
   users to different VLANs, for example), it is generally per client or
   user rather than by application.

   An alternative approach would be to provide different limited
   reachability domains for different internal resources.  In that
   approach, a client would be connected to an LRD specific to the
   resource required.  Because each of those LRDs could use different
   access methods and be available via different ingress points, it
   would be valuable to have a general mechanism for distributing the
   reachablity method needed for each resource.  This draft proposes a
   DNS Resource Record for this purpose, with the assumption that it
   would be made available on the public side of any split DNS.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft                  The RM RR                     March 2012


2.  Applicability Statement

   Reachability Method (RM) records can be queried directly, but it is
   expected that they will commonly be returned as additional data by
   servers relating information about hosts that are located within a
   limited reachability domain (e.g. with queries for the A or AAAA
   record associated with a host within an enterprise network).  While
   it is possible to associate an RM RR with a service name such as
   those used by SRV or URI RRs, this is not generally recommended,
   since the reachability information may vary for each target.  It
   would also be possible to associate a reachability method with a
   wildcard target (like *.internal.example.net), but this would limit
   the advantage over straight configuration to load-balancing entry
   points according to the weight and priority of the targets given in
   the RM RRs.


3.  DNS Consideration

   If the reachability method varies over time, the TTL of the RM RR
   will need to be managed to match and coordinated with the TTL of the
   resource to be reached.  If the reachability method varies according
   to other characteristics, something akin to split DNS must be
   managed, with the usual conflicts with the DNS's core loose
   consistency model.


4.  The format of the RM RR

   This is the presentation format of the RM RR:

   Ownername TTL Class RM Priority Weight Target

   The RM RR does not cause any kind of Additional Section processing.

4.1.  Ownername, class, and type

   The type number for the RM record is TBD (to be assigned by IANA).

   The RM resource record owner name has no special considerations.

   The RM resource record is class independent.

   The RM resource record has no special TTL processing requirements,
   though the considerations on coordiation stated above apply.

Internet-Draft                  The RM RR                     March 2012


4.2.  Priority

   The priority of the target Reachability Method in this RR.  Its range
   is 0-65535.  A client MUST attempt to contact the URI with the
   lowest-numbered priority it can reach; RMs with the same priority
   SHOULD be tried in the order defined by the weight field.

4.3.  Weight

   A server selection mechanism.  The weight field specifies a relative
   weight for entries with the same priority.  Larger weights SHOULD be
   given a proportionately higher probability of being selected.  The
   range of this number is 0-65535.

4.4.  Target

   The target is a URI, enclosed in double-quote characters ('"').
   Resolution of the URI is according to the definitions for the Scheme
   of the URI.  The URI is encoded as one or more <character-string> RFC
   1035 section 3.3 [RFC1035].


5.  RM RDATA Wire Format

   The RDATA for a RM RR consists of a 2 octet Priority field, a two
   octet Weight field, and a variable length target field.

   Priority and Weight are unsigned integers in network byte order.

   The Target field contains the URI of the Reachability Method (without
   the enclosing double- quote characters used in the presentation
   format), encoded as a sequence of one or more <character-string> (as
   specified in section 3.3 of RFC 1035, where all but the last
   <character-string> are filled up to the maximum length of 255 octets.

   The Target field can also contain an IRI, but with the additional
   requirements that it is in UTF-8 RFC 3629 [RFC3629] and possible to
   convert to a URI according to section 3.1 of RFC 3987 [RFC3987] and
   back again to an IRI according to section 3.2.  Other character sets
   than UTF-8 are not allowed.  The domain name part of the IRI can be
   either an U-LABEL or an A-LABEL as defined in RFC 5890 [RFC5890].

6.  Example Use

   Probably the easiest way to understand how this RR might be used is
   by contrasting it with happens with a user without it.  Imagine a
   user is trying to use a financial application client from a home or
   hotspot network.  The server for that client resides within the
   user's enterprise network.  If invoked, the client will attempt to
   resolve the hostname "accounting.corp.example.com".  In the currently
   common scenario, that hostname would not be visible from a home or
   hotspot because of split DNS.  To use it, the user must recognize
   that the required host was within a corporate domain and initiate a
   VPN in order to succeed at the DNS request.  It is likely that once
   that VPN was up, the point-to-multipoint nature of the VPN would
   allow the user to connect to accounting.corp.example.com with the
   financial application client.  Once the VPN is up, however, other
   resources within corp.example.com's network are likely to be
   reachable to processes on the user's device.

   The simplest implementation of the alternate method described here
   would be a wrapper script for the financial application client.  The
   wrapper script looks up the hostname accounting.corp.example.com and
   gets an RM record along with the A or AAAA record.  The script then
   creates the tunnel using the method defined in the RM method, which
   would be something like:

   finance.example.com IN RM 10 1 "ssh://financetunnel.example.com:/"

   prompting the user for authentication credentials appropriate to the
   target if need be.  The script then bind the application to the
   tunnel interface when it starts, so that it can only reach that
   portion of the network accessible from financetunnel.example.com.

   Real deployments based on wrapper scripts seem unlikley, given the
   need to manage authentication credentials and DNSSEC validation of
   the records returned, but the basic series of steps would be the
   same: get the reachability method associated with a resource; use it

   application with the limited reachability domain made available via
   the tunnel or overlay.


7.  Acknowledgements

   The work on which this is based was co-authored with Tom Keitel.  The
   text for describing both the presentation and wire formats of the
   priority field and the weight field of this RR are lifted wholesale
   from the URI RR internet-draft submitted by Patrik Faltstrom and Olaf
   Kolkman URI-RR [I-D.faltstrom-uri].  This document's overall
   organization and IANA considerations are also largely derived from
   that draft.  Harald Alvestrand kindly provided early feedback on this
   draft, despite his overall impression of its wisdom..


8.  IANA Considerations

   This memo asks IANA to register a new Resource Record Type, adding
   the line below, suitably amended, to the registry named Resource
   Record (RR) TYPEs and QTYPEs as defined in BCP 42RFC 5395 [RFC5395]
   and located at http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters.

   TYPE         Value and meaning                              Reference
   -----------  ---------------------------------------------  ---------
   RM          TBD a URI for a service (per the owner name)  [RFCXXXX]



9.  Security Considerations

   The overall goal of the RM RR is to standardize a way to nominate a
   monkey-in-the-middle, so using it without a DNSSEC-based assurance
   that the data you have received is the data placed there by the zone
   administrator would be deeply unwise.  Placing information about the
   approved monkey-in-the-middle into the public DNS also makes it a
   potential target of attack, both for denial of service and for
   infiltration

   Why, then, would you take this approach?  If you have a series of
   services which need to be reachable to users but which cannot
   themselves be safely be made accessible to the public Internet, you
   can use this approach to segment the reachability to each, using
   unique authentication or authorization decisions for the individual
   overlay networks.  The authentication methods for the bastion hosts
   can also vary and be made arbitrarily strong, something which may not
   be possible for services which are being used but may not be

   maintained by their creators.

   The choice of the URI format for the target is also somewhat
   problematic, as few candidate reachability methods have registered
   URI schemes.  If the registered schemes are not available, it will be
   tempting to mint new or local schemes which may miss critical fetures
   of the actual reachability methods.
