             Network Architecture with Recursive Addressing
                          draft-dykim-nara-01

Abstract

   A network architecture based on recursive addressing is proposed.
   The Internet is modeled as a network of autonomous domains, each
   being a collection of nodes.  Each domain is named by a global
   address whereas each node by a local address.  Inter-domain routing
   depends solely on domain addresses while intra-domain routing on node
   addresses.  Routing based on node or domain addresses render inherent
   mobility as well as seamless multi-homing capability.  The model can
   recursively repeat itself both outwards and inwards in the network,
   enabling its applicability, for example, to inter-planetary as well
   as body area networks.

1.  Introduction

   Scalability of the Internet has long been recognized as one of its
   major problems.  Explosion of DFZ(Default Free Zone) routing tables,
   one aspect of the problem, has resulted from the Internet's inability
   of efficient multi-homing, for which semantic overloading of the IP
   address has been blamed.  This semantic overloading, that IP
   addresses are used as both the identifiers(IDs) and the
   Locators(Locs) for nodes, has also been perceived as against the
   naming and addressing principles[IEN0001][IEN0019][RFC1498] and so as
   the main obstacle hindering the Internet from providing fast mobility
   and seamless multihoming.

   A considerable number of protocols based on the Loc/ID
   Separation(LIS) architecture have been proposed.  Some of them are
   host-based solutions [RFC4423][GSE][ILNP][IEEE-MCOM]while others are
   router-based[LISP][IRON][Ivip].  Most such proposals share one thing;
   IDs and Locs are global.

   This document proposes an architecture, named NARA, based on local
   addressing in its strict sense.  Local addresses, for nodes, are
   never exploited in DFZ routing.  A collection of nodes under an
   autonomous administration is called a domain, and only domain
   addresses identifying them are used for inter-domain routing.  That
   way, the global network is split into two rather orthogonal tiers.

   NARA is very close to the ideas proposed in ENCAPS and
   hIPv4[RFC1955][RFC6306].  The latter two, however, name node
   interfaces (or point of attachment: PoA) with either global IP
   addresses (in ENCAPS) or local Endpoint Locators (in hIPv4), whereas
   node themselves are named by local addresses in NARA.

   Node addresses in NARA are semantically overloaded.  They are used
   for end-to-end connections as well as for routing.  This is a stark
   contrast to prevalent arguments of LIS.  Semantic overloading is not
   seen as an evil in NARA, but is rather positively exploited to
   provide fast mobility and seamless multihoming.

   Although this document describes NARA in two-tier networks, the same
   addressing and routing principles can be recursively repeated inwards
   and outwards off a given network tier.  In this sense, NARA can be
   considered as one of recursive network architectures.

   Following sections provide a generic description of the NARA
   architecture and associated routings.  Implemetation choices for a
   better chance of deployability are then discussed.  Consequences of
   the proposal are discussed before concluding the document.

2.  ARCHITECTURE

   The Internet is modeled as a networked collection of autonomous
   domains.  A domain is a collection of nodes, also called either
   hosts(leaf nodes) or routers(relay nodes).  A subset of hosts and an
   associated router forms a subnet.  Therefore, a domain can also be
   considered as a networked collection of subnets.  A domain itself can
   be a leaf or a transit.

                 Figure 1: Architectiral Overview of NARA

   The Internet at one instance of the hierarchy is therefore governed
   by the two-tier administration, i.e., the global authority and the
   local domain authorities.

   A domain is named by a global address while a node by an address
   local to a given domain.  Now that each subnet is associated with a
   router, it can be identified by the router address.  Therefore, the
   subnet address and the router address will be used interchangeably in
   this document.

   A domain is marked by a gateway router, G in Fig. 1.  One of the
   important functions of the gateway is to swap addresses of packets at
   their passing in either direction.  That is, when a packet leaves a
   domain, its address is swapped to a global address.  When entering a
   domain, its address is swapped back to a local address.  In fact, a
   gateway is a NAT(Network Address/Port Translator) router.

   Inter-domain routing is done solely on domain addresses while intra-

   domain routing on node addresses.  Node addresses are never exposed
   to inter-domain routing.  That is, inter- and intra-domain routings
   are orthogonal to each other.

   In addition to routing, node addresses are also associated with
   transport connections.  In this sense, it can be said that node
   addresses are semantically overloaded.  In NARA, semantic overloading
   of addresses is not considered harmful; it is rather natural and even
   desirable.

   For a transport connection between a local node and a global node,
   the far end of the connection as seen by a local node would be
   identified by {global node address, port} as usual.  However, that as
   seen by the global node would be identified by {global domain
   address, port} because of the NAT funtion of the gateway.

   Normally, neither node- nor domain-addresses bear topological
   significance; they each consume separate flat number spaces.  Node
   addresses don't change while nodes are moving around within a domain.
   Domain addresses don't change at migration across upstream network
   providers as well as at multi-homing.  In a rare case of
   implementation instance, domain addresses might bear topological
   significance as with the current Internet.  In this case, only the
   domain address would change at migration to a different network
   provider.  At multi-homing, a domain can be given multiple domain
   addresses from different network providers.

   The FQDN(Fully Qualified Domain Name) of a node would be resloved
   first to a domain address by a global name server.  A local name
   server then resolves the rest to a local node address.

   A node in a given domain can itself be a domain.  That is, the node
   can be marked by a gateway and contain children nodes inside.  This
   way, the generic two-tier architecture can recur as needed.

3.  INTRA-DOMAIN ROUTING

   Packets in the domain tier, interior to domains, are routed solely on
   node addresses.  Domain addresses don't come into play in intra-
   domain routing.  Any protocols including OSPF and ISIS can be applied
   to this intra-domain routing.

   Node addresses are directly used in routing and forwarding decisions.
   Each router maintains an address table of {node, (associated) router,
   next-hop router} tuples.  Tables are updated through routing
   information exchange between routers.

   Hosts may not involve themselves directly with such routing tables.
   It is up to routers to route packets exiting nodes.

   When a node moves from one subnet to another, such a membership
   change is broadcast as a link-state update to all other routers in
   the domain by the previous and/or newly visited subnet router(s).
   Host mobility is provided directly by routers in this way and hence
   is fast.

   Moving of a subnet is the same as moving of the associated router,
   and such a move will be perceived as a topological change of the
   network and so will be reflected in the routing tables at link-state
   updates.  Henceforth, (subnet) network mobility is provided also as
   an inherent feature of the routing.

   A sever mapping node addresses to associated router addresses could
   be deployed in the domain to shrink the router table size.  In this
   scenario, moving of a node is not broadcast to all routers but is
   notified only to the mapping server.  The mapping server maintains an
   address table of {node, router} tuples whereas only {node, next-hop
   router} are cached in each router.  When the target node address of
   an incoming packet is missing in its forwarding table, the router
   consults the mapping server to acquire the {node, router} tuple.
   Then by further consulting its own routing table, the router would
   generate a cache entry of {node, next-hop router} in the forwarding
   table.  Expiraton timers for forwarding cache would be an engineering
   issue.

4.  INTER-DOMAIN ROUTING

   Packets in the global tier, exterior to domains, are routed solely on
   domain addresses.  Node addresses are not advertised into the global
   tier.  Any protocols, BGP, OSPF or ISIS, can be applied to this
   inter-domain routing.

   Each transit-domains can be considered to correspond, in a generic
   network graph, to relay nodes(routers) whereas leaf domains to leaf
   nodes(hosts).  That is, symmetry of network architecture repeats
   itself at each tier.  Therefore, the same routing features of intra-
   domain routing can be applied to inter-domain routing with tranist-
   domains and leaf domains in place of routers and hosts, respectively.

5.  IMPLEMENTATION CHOICES

   Although the proposed network architecture of NARA is described in a
   generic way, it can be tailored for smooth and incremental deployment
   in the existing Internet.

5.1.  Node Address

   In principle, both IPv4 and IPv6 private addresses can be used for
   local node addresses.  However, since the range of IPv4 private
   addresses might be enough for most domains, use of IPv4 addresses
   might be more appealing.

   Use of IPv4 addresses ensures minimal changes to existing vast
   population of IPv4 hosts.  Transition to IPv6 addresses will not be a
   requisite anymore, but a luxurious option at most.

   It is to be noted that IP addresses adopted as such do not name
   interfaces anymore but name nodes themselves.  That is, although IP
   addresses will continue to be used, interpretation of their context
   will be changed.

5.2.  Domain Address

   The routing prefix of a whole domain, i.e., the aggragate address of
   the whole PA(provider-aggregatable) addresses already assigned to the
   domain, can be used as the domain address.  However, since the
   provider does not have to assign a huge range of addresses to a
   domain anymore, only a single full-32-bit PA address can also be
   given to a domain, thus saving a lot of the public address resource.

5.3.  Gateway

   An important funtion of the gateway is to swap addresses of packets
   passing throught it.  That is, a gateway is a NAT router.  A node
   address will be replaced with a domain address at packet exit, and
   vice versa at packet entry.

5.4.  Name Servers

   DNS working in a strictly hiearchical manner would serve the purpose
   of the name servers of NARA.  The FQDN(Fully Qualified Domain Name)
   of a node would be resloved first to a domain address by a global
   name server.  A local name server then resolves the rest to a local
   node address.

5.5.  Routing Protocols

   OSPF or IS-IS can be used for intra-domain routing.  A difference is
   that IP addresses (as node addresses) now points to nodes instead of
   interfaces.  Changes to OSPF coding should be minimal.  IS-IS might
   be preferable since it inherently deals with node addresses.

   Although other protocols, in principle, could also be used for inter-
   domain routing, BGP4 with PA addresses might be the immediate option
   not much to disturb the current operation of the Internet.

6.  CONSEQUENCES

6.1.  Recursive Internet

   In NARA, the network architectures of the interior (intra-domain) and
   the exterior (global) tiers are symmetric, basically the same.
   Therefore, the same generic architecture can be repeated without
   bound outwards as well as inwards.  For example, in the design of an
   inter-planetary Internet, the same architecture can be placed on top
   of the global Internet.  Also, in accommodating edge networks like
   body area networks which by themselves may each consist of a huge
   number of internal nodes(e.g. in the case of intelligent robots),
   repetition of the same architecture might significantly reduce the
   complexity of the whole-scale networking.

   The Internet modeled as with NARA can be asserted to be scalable and
   expandable without bound.

6.2.  No Address Depletion

   Since the global Internet is split into two tiers of manageable size,
   there'd be no danger of address depletion.  The 32-bit length for
   node addresses will be more than enough for most domains' need.  The
   same should be true of the 32-bit domain address length.  In fact,
   migration to IPv6 is not a requirement anymore, but merely a
   luxurious option.

6.3.  No Inadvertent Internet Governance

   Since domains don't have to buy node address spaces from any
   authorities, the impact of the Internet governance will reduce only
   to a minimal necessity.

6.4.  Fast Mobility

   Host mobility inside a domain is provided as default.  Transport
   connections are associated with node addresses which don't change
   while nodes are moving inside a given domain.  Transport connections
   don't break at intra-domain host mobility.  And since such mobility
   is directly provided by link-state routing, with periodic link-state
   updates augmented by immediate event broadcasts, host mobility is as
   fast as the frequency and speed of broadcast packet propagation.

   Network(subnet) mobility is also provided as an inherent feature of
   intra-domain routing.  Renumbering of mobile subnets is not necessary
   since each subnet is identified by the associated router address
   which, being itself a node address, does not change inside a given
   domain.

6.5.  Site Multi-homing and Migration

   Domain addresses also don't change at migration to new upstream
   transit domains.

   Domain multi-homing with flat address is not a problem, either.  The
   same domain address of a multi-homed domain will simply be seen
   simultaneously in gateway routing tables of involved upstream transit
   domains.

6.6.  Host Multi-homing

   Host multi-homing can also be supported.  If a host is multi-homed on
   multiple domains, there'd be multiple return domain addresses for the
   same name.  Transport connections through different domains would be
   considered as different ones.  If there's need to converge these
   multiple connections to be presented as a single virtual transport
   connection to a given application, some sort of session management
   function might be exploited on top of the transport layer as is done
   with MPTCP[RFC6182].

6.7.  Traffic Engineering

   Gateways of a multi-homed domains can control inbound traffic
   according to the remote domain addresses.  Interior routers can also
   choose exit gateways in accordance with target domain addresses.

   If traffic engineering in the granularity of a node is desired, nodes
   may involve themselves in informing the subnet routers of their
   preferred domain address of a given remote multi-homed domain or even
   the preferred domain address of a given remote multi-homed node.  The
   same can be done for preference about the exiting gateway.

6.8.  No Renumbering

   Since node addresses are local, no renumbering of nodes is necessary
   at domain migration or multi-homing.

6.9.  Semantic Overloading

   The current proposal implicitly suggests that semantic overloading of
   an address may not be seen as a fatal problem to a network
   architecture.  The addresses, of nodes and domains, are used both for
   identification and routing in NARA.  This contextual malleability of
   addresses is seen as rather a virtue than an evil.  It can also be
   argued that whatever separation one might engineer, semantic
   overloading would inevitably result one way or another and so should
   rather be received as a natural phenomenon of networking.

7.  CONCLUSIONS

   A network architecture based on local and recursive addressing is
   introduced.  The Internet is seen as a collection of domains, each
   being itself a collection of nodes.  Addresses local to a given
   domain name nodes whereas global addresses do domains.  Mobility, of
   both hosts and subnets, is fast because it is provided directly by
   routers as one of their inherent features.  Frozen domain- as well as
   node- addresses guarantee seamless domain migration and multi-homing
   with no need of renumbering.  Address depletion is not an issue
   anymore and the Internet governance reduces to a minimal necessity.
   The proposed network model can repeat itself outwards as well as
   inwards, enabling its applicability to inter-plenary Internet as well
   as to body area networks.
