                     The SEAL IPv6 Extension Header
                      draft-templin-sealopt-00.txt

Abstract

   The Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL) provides a
   mid-layer header designed for the encapsulation of an inner network
   layer packet within outer network layer headers.  SEAL also supports
   a transport mode of operation, where the inner payload corresponds to
   an ordinary transport layer payload.  However, SEAL can also provide
   benefit when used as an IPv6 extension header.  Namely, the SEAL
   header when used as an extension header contains a digital signature
   or nonce inserted by the source.  The source can thereafter use the
   digital signature/nonce to verify that any ICMPv6 messages received
   actually came from a router on the path.

1.  Introduction

   The Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL)
   [I-D.templin-intarea-seal] provides a mid-layer encapsulation
   designed for the encapsulation of an inner network layer packet
   within outer network layer headers.  SEAL also supports a transport
   mode of operation, where the encapsulated payload corresponds to an
   ordinary transport layer protocol payload.  It is in essence a close
   analogy of the GRE encapsulation format [RFC1701].

   However, SEAL can also provide benefit when used as an IPv6 extension
   header [RFC2460].  Namely, the SEAL header when used as an IPv6
   extension header contains a digital signature or nonce inserted by
   the source.  The source can thereafter use the digital signature/
   nonce to verify that any ICMPv6 messages [RFC4443] received actually
   came from a router on the path.


2.  SEAL IPv6 Extension Header

   The SEAL IPv6 extension header can be inserted in either a "short
   form" or a "long form".  In short form, the header includes a
   signature/nonce chosen by the source.  In long form the header also
   includes an Identification value used for anti-replay sequencing.
   The short form is formatted as shown in Figure 1:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  Next Header  |Hdr Ext Len = 1|    SEAL Header (format TBD)   |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                       Signature / Nonce                       |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

         Figure 1: SEAL IPv6 Extension Header Format - Short Form

   Next Header (8)  an 8-bit field that encodes the next header Internet
      Protocol number the same as for the IPv4 protocol and IPv6 next
      header fields.

   Next Header Length (8)  an 8-bit length of the extension header
      measured in 8-byte words.  Set to 1 in short format, and set to 2
      in long format.

   SEAL Header (16)
      a 16-bit field that controls the operation of SEAL.  Format TBD.

   Signature/Nonce
      a 32-bit signature or nonce.  When used as a digital signature,
      covers the leading 128 bytes of the packet beginning with the SEAL
      extension header (or up to the end of the packet).  The value 128
      is chosen so that at least the SEAL header as well as the inner
      packet network and transport layer headers are covered by the
      signature.

   The long form is formatted as shown in Figure 2
       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      |                        Identification                         |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                          Reserved                             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

          Figure 2: SEAL IPv6 Extension Header Format - Long Form

   Identification (32)
      a 32-bit per-packet identification field.  Set to a monotonically-
      incrementing 32-bit value for each SEAL packet transmitted,
      beginning with 0.

   Reserved (32)
      a 32-bit reserved field.

   The IPv6 source inserts a SEAL extension header when it needs to
   ensure that any resulting ICMPv6 error messages came from a router on
   the path and not from an off-path attacker.  When the source receives
   an ICMPv6 error message, it verifies that the signature/nonce value
   is correct.  When a signature is used, the source calculates the
   signature based on a secret hashing algorithm of its choosing.  The
   source should choose a hashing algorithm that would make it extremely
   difficult for an off-path attacker to guess.


3.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is instructed to allocate an IPv6 extension header for SEAL.

4.  Security Considerations

   The SEAL extension header can be used to verify that ICMPv6 messages
   were delivered by an on-path router and not an off-path attacker.
   The signature may also be used for other authenticating purposes,
   e.g., if the destination shares a symmetric secret key with the
   source then the destination can verify that messages actually came
   from the source.  The packet identification field can also be used
   for anti-replay sequencing.
