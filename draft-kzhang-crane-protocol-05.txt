This document defines the Common Reliable Accounting for Network
Element (CRANE) protocol that enables efficient and reliable delivery
of any data, mainly accounting data from Network Elements to any
systems, such as mediation systems and Business Support
Systems (BSS)/ Operations Support Systems (OSS).  The protocol is
developed to address the critical needs for exporting high volume of
accounting data from NE's with efficient use of network, storage, and
processing resources.

This document specifies the architecture of the protocol and the
message format, which MUST be supported by all CRANE protocol
implementations.
