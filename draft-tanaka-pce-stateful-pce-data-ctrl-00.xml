                Stateful PCE (Path Computation Element) and its corresponding protocol extensions 
				provide a mechanism that enables PCE to do stateful control of MPLS Traffic 
				Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSP). One application that stateful PCE can 
				realize is data traffic reoptimization. Data traffic traversed in a LSP can be 
				switched to another PCE-initiated LSP. Moreover, data traffic can also be balanced 
				to multiple PCE-initiated LSPs using stateful PCE.
            </t>
            <t>
                This document specifies the extensions to Path Computation Element Protocol 
				(PCEP) that allow a stateful PCE to do switchover and balancing of data traffic 
				with PCE-initiated LSPs. This document also specifies the usage and handling 
				of stateful PCEP (PCE Communication Protocol) messages and the expected behavior 
				of PCC as the RSVP-TE headend.

            <t>
                <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce"/> describes the stateful Path 
				Computation Elements(PCE). Stateful PCE defines the extensions to PCEP to 
				enable stateful control of LSPs between and across PCEP sessions, and it 
				also describes mechanisms to effect LSP state synchronization between 
				PCCs and PCEs, and PCE control of timing and sequence of path computations 
				within and across PCEP sessions. A PCE can update LSP settings (such as bandwidth,
				priority) using update messages calle PCUpd.
                
            </t>
            <t>
                <xref target="I-D.crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp"/> defines the exensions to 
				PCEP to allow a PCE to create new LSPs (PCE-Initiated LSP). Before these extensions,
				the LSP egress point had to be preconfigured at the head end Label Edge Router (LER),
				the LSP would be set up with default parameters and then 
				its settings (e.g., initial bandwidth, priority) could be modified via PCUpd
				messages. The extensions for PCE-initated LSPs eliminate the need for preconfiguration,
				and allow more flexible operation. Stateful-PCE with LSP instantiation is attracting attention as 
				an enabler for Software Defined Networking (SDN) operation of MPLS networks.
            </t>
            <t>
                In SDN, it is highly expected to support intelligent and interactive control of 
				the traffic amount of the network by means of a logically-centralized controller. 
				Optimizing the path and bandwidth of MPLS-TE LSP by using stateful PCE is a 
				leading use case of SDN applications. A PCE is able to calculate an optimized route 
				from the topology and bandwidth information in the TED and the LSP state database 
				and it can integrate with a controller that takes into account additional information 
				such as historical trending and service orders in order to trigger PCE action. 
				For example, when data traffic on a LSP counts plenty of bandwidth utilization and 
				if there is no capacity left in the currently signaled path (i.e., no remaining 
				bandwidth of links), a PCE is able to update the existing LSP's parameters 
				(PCE-updated LSP) or create a totally new LSP (PCE-initiated LSP).
            </t>
            <t>
                The former method is oriented for keeping the existing instance of LSP tunnel, 
				so it does not change a pair of source and destination. Meanwhile, the latter method 
				is oriented for adding a new instance of LSP tunnel.
            </t>
            <t>
                Specifically regarding the latter method, PCE-initiated LSP, there are some 
				operational scenarios in the network: one is that PCE creates a new LSP that have 
				alternate route with increased-bandwidth LSP and performs switchover from old LSP. 
				Another is that PCE creates one or more additional LSPs and performs load balancing 
				of data traffic.
                Today, however, there is no detailed procedure specified as to how to control data 
				traffic switching from an old LSP to new PCE-Initiated LSP(s).
            </t>
            <t>
                This document specifies the procedures that stateful PCE controls data 
				traffic switchover and load balancing with multiple PCE-Initiated LSPs. 
				This document also specifies the usage and handling of stateful PCEP (
				PCE Communication Protocol) messages and the expected behavior of PCC as an 
				RSVP-TE headend.

Hence the protection allocates LSP resource in advance of a failure, while the restoration allocates LSP after a failure occur.

        <section title="PCEP Operation for Data Switchover and Balancing">
            <t>
                There are two typical operations for explaining the functionality of data 
				switchover and balancing. One is whole data switchover, where a PCC switches 
				all data traffic from one LSP tunnel to another. The other is load balancing 
				of multi-pathing LSP tunnels, where a PCC (headend) balances data traffic among 
				two tunnels equally (fifty percent each, for instance). Both operational cases 
				are completed by the messaging over a single protocol, PCEP, so this is a simple 
				and straightforward solution for MPLS networks.
            </t>
			
			<!-- Negotiation (Capability bit ) is out of scope at this moment. -->
			<t> 
				Support of the procedures listed in this document is negotiated at session init time. 
				The capability negotiation will be speleld out in a future version of this document. 
			</t> 
            <t>      
                Data switchover and balancing for an MPLS-TE LSP is available once a PCEP session 
				is established and then a PCC delegates its LSPs to a PCE. <!--Delegated LSPs MUST be ready for data switchover and balancing.-->
            </t>
            <t>
                First step is LSP creation. In this step, a PCE sends as many PCInitiate messages as 
				PCE-Initiated LSP as it demands. Once the PCC receives them and successfully establishes 
				PCE-Initiated LSPs, it sends PCRpt messages in reply to the PCInitiate messages and 
				delegates the newly established LSP to the PCE. Message formats and behaviors of the 
				PCC and the PCE are described in detail in <xref target="I-D.crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp"/>.
            </t>
            <t>
                Second step is LSP association. After the PCE-Initiated LSP sucessfully established 
				and delegated the PCE sends a PCUpd message that 
				contains the  ASSOCIATION-GROUP TLV in the LSP Object in order to assemble 
				the members of an association group of LSPs to take over the traffic.
                Once a PCC receives the PCUpd message with ASSOCIATION-GROUP TLV, the PCC sends back 
				a PCRpt message that contains the ASSOCIATION-GROUP TLV with current operational status.
            </t>
			<t>
				The option of specifying the association at LSP instantiation time (as part of the 
				PCInitiate message) will be evaluated in a future version of this document. 
			</t>
            <t>
                Third step is executing the data switchover and/or load balancing. In this step, 
				the PCE sends a single PCUpd message which updates the operational status of the 
				LSP from "up and carrying traffic" to just "up".
                This Update request message for data plane switchover/balancing execution MUST 
				contain DATA-CONTROL TLV in LSP Object. The associated group of traffic origin 
				and that of target to take over the traffic are listed in the DATA-CONTROL TLV. 
				The PCC (LSP headend) load-balances between LSPs in the same association group 
				based on their respective bandwidths. 
                If one of the LSPs does not come up, the traffic would load balance correctly 
				over the others. The switchover case is supported since there will be an 
				association of a single LSP, so that LSP will get hundred percent of data traffic.

                <!--The PCUpd message MUST contain at least two LSP objects: one represents the LSP 
				of traffic origin, which carries current data traffic, and the other represents 
				the LSPs on which whole or a part of data traffic will be carried. Each LSP 
				Object in the PCUpd message MUST contain DATA-CONTROL TLV in order to specify 
				which LSP is traffic origin or target(s) of switchover/balancing. -->

            </t>
            <t>
                The PCC MUST send a PCRpt message to the PCE in order to notify of the result of the 
				data switchover/balancing. The PCRpt message MUST have the DATA-CONTROL TLV that 
				indicates the actual assigned percentages of each member of association group after 
				the execution of the data switchover/balancing operation. The LSP object in the PCRpt 
				will have the reserved PLSP-ID of 0. 

            </t>
            <t>
                The final step is the deletion of old LSP. It is OPTIONAL to carry out this step. 
				The PCE sends PCInitiate message requesting deletion of the LSP that does not carry 
				data traffic anymore after data switchover/balancing execution. Once the PCC tears 
				down the LSP, a PCRpt message MUST be sent from the PCC to the PCE in order to 
				notify that the LSP is no longer used and return delegation.
            </t>
            <t>
                Note that, both RSVP-TE <xref target="RFC3209"/> Tunnel-ID and LSP-ID for 
				PCE-Initiated LSP signaling is not allocated by a PCE. A PCC locally assigns 
				those IDs that are related to RSVP-TE parameters. Therefore, the operations of 
				data switchover and balancing specified in this document is the traffic control 
				procedure across multiple RSVP-te Tunnels (i.e., different Tunnel instances). 
				Data switchover method across LSPs within a single RSVP-TE Tunnel, which is the 
				switchover in the middle of make-before-break reoptimization, is covered by 
				<xref target="I-D.tanaka-pce-stateful-pce-mbb"/>.

                    An association group is a group of LSPs that is referenced by a single identifier, 
					by both the PCE and PCC. This number is significant in the context of a single PCEP
					session. An association group may have one or more LSPs. Association
					groups with zero members are removed and the id can be reused. The PCE is the entity
					managing association, and this is considered PCE state that will be cleaned up 
					when the State Timeout Interval expires.
					An LSP can be associated with a single association group. Extensions for support of
					multiple association groups are left for a future version of this document.
			    </t>
				<t>
					To create a new association group on a PCC, a PCE sends a PCUpd message which 
					contains the LSP Object(e.g. PLSP-ID=100) and ASSOCIATION-GROUP TLV (Association 
					Group ID=10) in the LSP object. Next, a PCE sends the another PCUpd message 
					with another LSP Object(e.g. PLSP-ID=200) and ASSOIATION-GROUP TLV(Association Group ID=10). 
					As a result, the PCC and PCE both recognize that Association Group ID 10 represents 
					PLSP-ID=100 and 200.
                </t>
                <t>
                    To remove a specific PLSP-ID from the association group, a PCE sends PCUpd 
					message which contains the LSP Object(PLSP-ID=100) and ASSOCIATION-GROUP TLV
					(Association Group ID=0x0000). Then a PCC removes the PLSP-ID 100 from any 
					association groups on the PCC.
                </t>
                <t>
                    To flush all association groups on a PCC, a PCE sends a PCUpd message which 
					contains the LSP Object(PLSP-ID=0x0000) and ASSOCIATION-GROUP TLV(Association 
					Group ID=0x0000). Then a PCC flushes all association groups. 
                </t>
<!-- This section is problematic, I am commenting out, it will otherwise create unnecessary discusison
                <t>
                    When a PCC successfully created/removed/flushed association group, the PCC 
					sends a PCRpt message that contains LSP Object with ASSOCIATION-GROUP TLV. 
					Association Group ID field fills the ID that the PCC has just created. 
					It fills 0x0000 if a PCC remove the member, and in addition, PLSP-ID set to 
					0x0000 if a PCC flush

                    The scenario is one where the starting state is a single LSP (of bandwidth 100 M)
					is carrying the 
					traffic. To enable better bin-packing, the PCE may want to create two smaller
					LSPs instead, each of 50M, and load balance the traffic over them. 
					To accomplish this, two association groups are used, the first 
					(say association group ID 10) 
					contains the LSP carrying the traffic, and the second (say association group ID 30)
					contains the two new smaller LSPs.
                    Expected PCUpd,PCRpt messages to create association group and to trigger
					load-balance follow (The instantiation of the original LSP of bandwidth 100M 
					and its association into group ID 10 is not shown)
