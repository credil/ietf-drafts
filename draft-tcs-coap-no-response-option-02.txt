                    CoAP option for no server-response
                   draft-tcs-coap-no-response-option-02


   Abstract

   There can be typical M2M scenarios where responses from the data
   sink to the data source against request/ notification from the
   source might be considered redundant. This kind of open-loop
   exchange (with no reverse path from the sink to the source) may be
   desired while updating resources or notifying about the updated
   status of a resource in constrained systems looking for maximized
   throughput with minimized resource consumption. CoAP already
   provides a non-confirmable (NON) mode of exchange where The
   receiving end-point does not respond with ACK. However, the
   receiving end-point responds the sender with a status code
   indicating "the result of the attempt to understand and satisfy the
   request".

   This draft introduces a header option: 'No-Resp' to suppress
   responses from the receiver and discusses exemplary use cases which
   motivated this proposition based on real experience. This option
   also provides granularity by allowing suppression of a particular
   class or a combination of classes of responses. This option is
   applicable for both request/ response as well as resource-observe
   mode and may be effective for both unicast and multicast scenarios.

1. Introduction

   This draft proposes a new header option 'No-Resp' for Constrained
   Application Protocol (CoAP). This option enables the sender end-
   point to explicitly express its disinterest in getting responses
   back from the receiving end-point. By default this option expresses
   disinterest in any kind of response. This option should be
   applicable along with non-confirmable (NON) updates/ notifications.
   At present this option will have no effect if used with confirmable
   (CON) mode.

   Along with the technical details this draft presents some practical
   application scenarios which should bring out the utility of this
   option.

1.1. Granular suppression of responses

   This option enables granularity by allowing the sender to choose the
   typical class or combination of classes of responses which it is
   disinterested in. For example, a sender may explicitly tell the
   receiver that no response is required unless something 'bad' happens
   and a response of class 4.xx or 5.xx is to be fed back to the
   sender. No response is required in case of 2.xx classes. A similar
   scheme is described in Section 3.7 of [I-D.ietf-core-groupcomm] on
   the server side. Here the server may perform granular suppression
   for group communication. But in this case the server itself decides
   whether to suppress responses or not. This option enables the

   clients to explicitly inform the server about the disinterest in
   responses.

1.2. Terminology

   The terms used in this draft are in conformance with those defined
   in [I-D.ietf-core-coap].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119.

2. Potential benefits

   If this option is opportunistically used with fitting M2M
   applications then the concerned systems may benefit in the following
   aspects:

       . Reduction of network clogging
       . Reduction in server-side loading
       . Reduction in battery consumption at the constrained end-point
       . Reduction in communication cost at the constrained end-point
       . May help to satisfy hard real-time requirements (since,
         waiting due to closed loop latency is completely avoided)

3. Exemplary application scenarios

   The described scenarios are confined within a communication pattern
   where there is a direct communication channel between a constrained
   device (the device may well be a constrained gateway) and an
   unconstrained backend. Also, we consider only the scenario of data
   updates which may happen in the following 2 forms:

      1)  Through a push to the server by the client using PUT or POST
        (request/ response)
      2)  Through notifications by the server to client in response to
         an 'observe' request by the client

   The application scenarios are classified into 2 categories as below:

   Category 1) Data-source=constrained device; Data-sink=backend.

   Category 2) Data-source=backend; Data-sink=constrained device.

   Next sub-section describes the user stories and the potential
   benefits in each of the cases through the use of No-Resp option. An
   Intelligent Traffic System (ITS) is considered as the base

   application. The application scenarios are formed out of its
   different aspects.

3.1. Frequent update of geo-location from vehicles to backend (Category
   1)

   Each vehicle in ITS is equipped with a sensor-gateway comprising
   sensors like GPS and Accelerometer. The sensor-gateway connects to
   the Internet using a low-bandwidth cellular (e.g. GPRS) connection.
   The GPS co-ordinates are periodically updated to the backend server
   by the gateway. In case of ITS the update rate is adaptive to the
   motional-state of the vehicle. If the vehicle moves fast the update
   rate is high as the position of the vehicle changes rapidly. If the
   vehicle is static or moves slowly then the update rate is low. This
   ensures that bandwidth and energy is not consumed unnecessarily. The
   motional-state of the vehicle is inferred by a local analytics,
   running on the sensor-gateway, using the accelerometer data and the
   rate of change in GPS co-ordinates. The back-end server hosts
   applications which use the updates for each vehicle and produce
   necessary information for remote users.

   The application may act in request/ response mode where the sensor-
   gateways push data to the backend. Or it can act in resource-observe
   mode where the backend initiates the exchange by sending observe
   requests to the sensor-gateways and receive updates in the form of
   notifications.

   Retransmitting a location co-ordinate which is already passed by a
   vehicle is not efficient as it adds redundant traffic to the
   network. So, the updates are done in NON mode. However, given the
   thousands of vehicles updating frequently, the NON exchange will
   also trigger huge number of status responses from the backend. Each
   response in the air is of 4bytes of application layer plus several
   bytes originating from the lower layers. Thus the cumulative load on
   the network will be quite significant.

   On the contrary, if the edge devices explicitly declare that they do
   not need any status response then significant load will be reduced
   from the network and the server as well.

3.1.1. Benefits using No-Resp

   Thus mapping the above scenario to the benefits mentioned in section
   2 reveals that use of 'No-Resp' will help in:

       -> Reduction of network clogging
       -> Reduction in server-side loading

 Internet-Draft  draft-tcs-coap-no-response-option-02    September 2013


       -> Help in achieving real-time requirements as the application 
         is not bound by any delay due to closed loop latency

3.2. A fleet-tracking application running on a PDA or smart-phone
   (Category 2)

   Now, let us consider the other side of the ITS backend. Say, the
   security personnel in a city are on high alert and want to track a
   high-speed train carrying some important statesmen. The application
   on the hand-held device subscribes to the ITS backend server and
   receives continuous real-time updates.

   If the handheld has to send a status response for each notification
   it receives then that will cost the device both in terms of
   communication cost and battery life. This can be avoided if, similar
   to the above scenario, the backend explicitly specifies that no
   response from the handheld is required. So, the backend uses 'No-
   Resp' for each of the notifications.

3.2.1. Benefits using No-Resp

   Thus mapping the above scenario to the benefits mentioned in section
   2 reveals that use of 'No-Resp' will help in:

       -> Reduction in battery consumption at the constrained end-point
       -> Reduction in communication cost at the constrained end-point
       -> Help in achieving real-time requirements as the application 
         is not bound by any delay due to closed loop latency.

3.3. Multicasting traffic congestion information to PDAs/ smart-phones
   using resource-observe (Category 2 with pseudo multicast)

   The ITS might have an application which runs some analytics at the
   backend and determines the instantaneous traffic congestion spots in
   a city. The analytics is done based on the real-time geo-location
   updates received from the vehicles within the system. The backend
   application multicasts the results of the analytics to the
   constrained handheld devices which subscribed for real-time updates
   on congestion points. So, in stricter terms, it is a pseudo
   multicast using resource observe. In this case the backend may use
   No-Resp option along with NON notifications to reduce the traffic
   generated due to simultaneous status responses from hundreds of
   subscribed handheld devices.

3.3.1. Using granular response suppression

   However, an intelligent application may use the granularity feature
   of this option such that the responses are fed-back to the backend
   when notification to particular devices causes errors. So the
   notifications may contain No-Resp saying that a response is to be
   suppressed only in success conditions and all responses in case of
   errors should be fed back. The server might eventually stop sending
   notification to the subscribed clients which responded with
   consecutive 'bad' responses. This will indirectly help saving
   network bandwidth.

3.3.2. Benefits using No-Resp

   Thus mapping the above scenario to the benefits mentioned in section
   2 reveals that use of 'No-Resp' will help in:

       -> Reduction of network clogging
       -> Reduction in battery consumption at the constrained end-point
       -> Reduction in communication cost at the constrained end-point

4. Option Definition

   The properties of this option are as in Table 1.

   +--------+-----+----------------+-------------+--------+---------+
   | Number | C/E |       Name     | Data Format | Length | Default |
   +--------+-----+----------------+-------------+--------+---------+
   |   TBD  |  E  |    No-Resp     |     uint    |   0-1  | (none)  |
   +--------+-----+----------------+-------------+--------+---------+
                           Table 1: Option Properties

   This option has a maximum length of 1 byte. When present with an
   empty value this option would express the sender's disinterest in
   all kinds of responses by default.

   This option may contain values to indicate disinterest in a
   particular class or combination of classes of responses as described
   in the next sub-section.

   This option is presently defined for update requests (e.g., PUT) in
   NON mode or for non-confirmable update notifications against an
   observe request. At present this option should have no effect if
   used with a CON request.

4.1. Achieving granular suppression

   The option length is 1 byte when this option is to be used for
   granular response suppression. This option is defined as a bit-map
   to achieve granularity as shown in Table 2.

   +-------+-----------------------+---------------------------------+
   | Value | Binary Representation |          Description            |
   +-------+-----------------------+---------------------------------+
   |   0   |      00000000         |           No suppression        |
   +-------+-----------------------+---------------------------------+
   |   1   |      00000001         | Suppress 2.xx success responses |
   +-------+-----------------------+---------------------------------+
   |   2   |      00000010         |   Suppress 4.xx client errors   |
   +-------+-----------------------+---------------------------------+
   |   4   |      00000100         |   Suppress 5.xx server errors   |
   +-------+-----------------------+---------------------------------+

                          Table 2: Option values


   XOR of the values defined for suppressing particular classes will
   result in suppression of a combination of classes of response. So, a
   value of 5 (binary: 00000101) will result in suppression of all 2.xx
   and 5.xx classes of responses.

   It is to be noted that a value of 7 will indicate that all types of
   responses to be suppressed which is same as No-Resp with empty
   value.

5. Example

   This section illustrates two examples of exchanges based on the
   scenario narrated in section 3.1. Examples for other scenarios can
   be easily conceived based on these illustrations.

5.1. Request/response Scenario

   Figure 1 shows a typical request with this option. The depicted
   scenario occurs when the vehicle#n moves very fast and update rate
   is high. The vehicle is assigned a dedicated resource: vehicle-stat-
   <n>, where <n> can be any string uniquely identifying the vehicle.
   The update requests are in NON mode. The No-Resp option causes the
   server not to reply with any status code.
