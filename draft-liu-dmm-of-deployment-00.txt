       Deployment of existing mobility protocols in DMM Scenario.
                     draft-liu-dmm-of-deployment-00

Abstract

   Distributed Mobility Managment(DMM) aims to eliminate the centralized
   anchor point of current IP mobility solutions to get better
   scalability and optimize the data plane routing.  Many soulutions
   have been proposed in DMM working group but before defining any new
   DMM protocol, it is a good approach to investigate first whether it
   is feasible to deploy current IP mobility protocol in DMM scenario in
   a way that can meet all the requirment of DMM.This document discusses
   the way of the deployment of current IP mobility protocol in DMM
   scenario and analyses the gaps between this approach and the DMM
   requirment.

1.  Introduction

   Most existing IP mobility solutions are derived from Mobile IP
   [RFC3775] principles where a given mobility anchor (e.g. the Home
   Agent (HA) in Mobile IP or the Local Mobility Agent (LMA) in Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] maintains Mobile Nodes (MNs) bindings.  Data
   traffic is then encapsulated between the MN or its Access Router
   (e.g. the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) in PMIPv6) and its mobility
   agent.  These approaches lead to the implementation of centralised
   architectures where both MN context and traffic encapsulation need to
   be maintained at a central network entity, the mobility anchor.  Such
   centralised approach provides the ability to route MN traffic
   whatever MN's localisation while maintaining IP session continuity
   during handovers.  However, when hundreds of thousands of MNs are
   communicating in a given cellular network, a centralized mobility
   anchoring point causes well-known bottlenecks and single point of
   failure issues, which requires costly network dimensioning and
   engineering to be fixed.  In addition, tunnelling encapsulations
   impact the overall network efficiency since they require the
   maintenance of MN's specific contexts in each tunnel end nodes and
   they incur delays in packet processing and transport functions.


2.  Distributed Mobility Management Use Cases

   Distribued Mobility Managment can be use in the following use cases:

   1.Local break out scenario

   The fast increase of data traffic gives operators much presure on
   their core network, operators have to extend their core network
   capacity and thence increase the cost.  To deal with this problem,
   operators tend to offload their traffic in the network edge to
   decrease the presure of their core network.  This kind of solution
   usually called "local break out".  In 3GPP, LIPA/SIPTO architecture
   is such kind of offload solutions for mobile operators.  In the local
   break out scenario, the traffic is routed near the access point, but
   current IP mobility solution's anchor point usually located in the
   core network level.  To solve this problem we can deploy the mobility
   anchor in the network edge, it will be discussed in detail in the
   following section.

   2.  CDN/Cache scenario

   Similar to the local break out scenario, CDN/Cache usually been
   deployed in the network edge.  In this scenario if all the data
   traffic still need to go back to a centralized mobility anchor in the
   core network it will cancel out the effect of CDN/cache.  So the

   solution is also to deploy the mobility anchor point near the access
   network.


3.  Deployment of current IP mobility protocol in DMM scenario

   Current IP mobility protocol can be classified into client-based
   solution and network based solution.  The basic idea is to deploy the
   mobility anchor near the access network and in this scenario, the MN
   may have more than one mobility anchors.

3.1.  Client-based mobility solution in DMM scenario

   One solution to deploy Mobile IP in DMM scenario is to implement the
   HA functionalities in the access routers, as shown on Figure 1.  Any
   given IP flow can be considered as implicitly anchored on the current
   host's access router when set up.  In addition, dynamic mobility
   anchoring [I-D.kassi-mobileip-dmi] could avoid data encapsulation for
   motionless nodes: until the host does not move, the IP flow is
   delivered as for any standard IPv6 node.  The anchoring function at
   the access router is acting only to manage traffic indirection while
   the host moves to a new access router.  So, when the MN handoff, its
   current traffic is still attached to the anchor access router which
   is responsible for forwarding the IP flows to the MN.For example,
   let's consider an IP flow, flow#1, initiated by the mobile node, MN,
   when attached to AR2.  Flow#1 will is routed in a standard way as
   long as the MN remain attached to AR2.  If the MN moves to AR3,
   flow#1 remains anchored to AR2, which plays the role of HA.  If MN
   starts a new IP communication, flow#2, while attached to AR3; flow#2
   will be routed in a standard way as long as the MN remains attached
   to AR3.  Then, if the MN moves to AR1, flow#1 and flow#2 will be
   respectively anchored to AR2/HA and AR3/HA.

3.2.  Network based mobility solution in DMM scenario

   Figure 2 shows the deployment of PMIP [RFC5213] in DMM scenario.  The
   basic is to distribute mobility traffic management with dynamic
   user's traffic anchoring in the access network nodes.  Each AR
   supports both the MAG and LMA functionalities.  Any given IP flow can
   be considered as implicitly anchored on the current host's access
   router when set up.  Until the host does not move, the IP flow is
   delivered as for any standard IPv6 node.  The anchoring function at
   the access router is thus acting only to manage traffic indirection
   while the host moves to a new access router.  So, when the MN
   handoff, its current traffic is still attached to the anchor access
   router which is responsible for forwarding its anchored MN's IP flows
   to the new MN's location (i.e. to the AR the MN is attached to).  For
   example, let's consider an IP flow, flow#1, initiated by the mobile
   node, MN, when attached to AR2.  Flow#1 will is routed in a standard
   way as long as the MN remain attached to AR2.  If the MN moves to
   AR3, flow#1 remains anchored to AR2, which plays the role of LMA.
   AR3 plays the role of MAG for MN/flow#1.  If MN starts a new IP
   communication, flow#2, while attached to AR3; flow#2 will be routed
   in a standard way as long as the MN remains attached to AR3.  Then,
   if the MN moves to AR1, flow#1 and flow#2 will be respectively
   anchored to AR2/LMA and AR3/LMA and AR1 will provide MAG
