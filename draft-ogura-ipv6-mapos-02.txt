Multiple Access Protocol over SONET/SDH (MAPOS) is a high-speed
link-layer protocol that provides multiple access capability over a
Synchronous Optical NETwork/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH).

This document specifies the frame format for encapsulating an IPv6
datagram in a MAPOS frame.  It also specifies the method of forming
IPv6 interface identifiers, the method of detecting duplicate
addresses, and the format of the Source/Target Link-layer Addresses
option field used in IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages.
