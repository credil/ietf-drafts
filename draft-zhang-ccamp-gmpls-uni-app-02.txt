1. Introduction 

   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) defines a series of 
   protocols, including Open Shortest Path Fist - Traffic Engineering 
   (OSPF-TE) [RFC4203] and Resource ReserVation Protocol - Traffic 
   Engineering (RSVP-TE) [RFC3473], which can be used to create Label 
   Switched Paths (LSPs) in a number of deployment scenarios with 
   various transport technologies.  

   The User-Network Interface (UNI) reference point is defined in the 
   Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON) [G.8080]. According to 
   [G.8080], the UNI may be implemented as a peering between a client-
   side entity (UNI-C) and a network-side entity (UNI-N). End-to-end 
   connectivity between UNI-C nodes is achieved across the core network 
   by three components: a UNI request from source UNI-C to source UNI-N; 
   a core network connection from source UNI-N to destination UNI-N; and 
   a UNI request from destination UNI-N to destination UNI-C. 

   The GMPLS overlay model, as per [RFC4208], can be applied at the UNI, 
   as shown in Figure 1.

                       Legend:   EN  -  Edge Node

              Figure 1 - Applying GMPLS overlay model at UNI 

   In Figure 1, assume that there is an end-to-end UNI connection 
   passing through EN1-CN1-CN2-CN3-EN3. For convenience, some terms used 
   in this document are defined below: 

   -  "source EN" refers to the edge-node who initiates the connection 
      (e.g., EN1);  

   -  "destination EN" refers to the edge-node where the connection is 
      terminated (e.g., EN3);  

   -  "ingress CN" refers to the core-node to which the source EN is 
      attached (e.g., CN1);  

   -  "egress CN" refers to the core-node to which the destination EN 
      is attached (e.g., CN3). 

   [RFC4208] provides mechanisms for UNI signaling, which are compatible 
   with GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling ([RFC3471] and [RFC3473]). A single end-
   to-end RSVP session between source EN and destination EN is used for 
   the user connection, just as it would be for connection creation 
   between two core nodes. However, when considering the isolation of 
   topology information between core network and the overlay network,

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-uni-app-02.txt                     October 2011 


   additional processing of the RSVP-TE Explicit Route Object (ERO) and 
   Record Route Object (RRO) is required. For example, the ingress CN 
   should verify the ERO it received against its topology database 
   before forwarding the PATH message. And the ingress/egress CN may 
   edit or remove the RRO in order to hide the path segment used inside 
   the core network from the EN. 

   The UNI can be used in many application scenarios. For example, in a 
   multi-layer network [RFC6001], the interface between client layer 
   node and server layer node can be seen as a UNI. Or, when deploying 
   VPN services such as Layer One Virtual Private Networks (L1VPNs) 
   [RFC4847], [RFC5253], users can connect to a service provider network 
   via a UNI. 

   This document examines a number of current and future GMPLS 
   application scenarios. It shows how techniques developed after the 
   GMPLS UNI was developed can be used to automate or enable critical 
   aspects of these application scenarios. It points out some potential 
   technology extensions that could improve UNI operation, and 
   highlights some existing unresolved issues. 

    

2. UNI Addressing 

   In [RFC4208], the GMPLS overlay model is applied at the UNI reference 
   point, and it is required that the edge-node and its attached core-
   node of the overlay network share the same address space that is used 
   by GMPLS to signal between the edge-nodes across the core network. 
   Under this condition, the user connection can be created using a 
   single end-to-end RSVP session, which is consistent with the RSVP 
   model. Therefore, RSVP-TE defined in [RFC3473] can be used for 
   support GMPLS UNI without any extensions.  

   However, in the practical deployment of GMPLS UNI, the requirement of 
   sharing the same address space between EN and its attached CN may not 
   be satisfied if the core network and the overlay network are designed 
   and deployed separately, especially if the two networks belong to 
   different carriers. For example, the core network may use IPv6 
   addresses, while the overlay network uses IPv4 addresses. Or, since 
   the core network is a closed system, the assignment of the IP 
   addresses of the CNs is independent of other IP addresses outside the 
   core network. This implies that the nodes in the core network may use 
   addresses which collide with the edge nodes in the overlay network.

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-uni-app-02.txt                     October 2011 


   [RFC4208] does not state how to allow that an edge-node and its 
   attached core-node share the same address space, so this document 
   analyzes the addressing deployment scenarios as follows: 

   1. Overlay network and core network share a common addressing policy. 
      As noted above, there are many situations where this may be 
      impractical, but it might be quite feasible in a multi-layer 
      network operated by a single carrier. In this scenario, end-to-end 
      UNI connectivity may use a single RSVP session, and the core 
      routing information (assuming it is shared and not stripped for 
      confidentiality reasons) will be meaningful to the ENs. Note, 
      however, that the overlay model examined by this document assumes 
      that there is some separation between the overlay and core 
      networks, and this might mean that the overlay network is not able 
      to see the topology or routing information of the core network 
      even when they share a common address space. 

   2. ENs have visibility into the core network, but overlay and core 
      networks have different address spaces. This is the more common 
      model envisaged by [RFC4208] and for basic mode L1VPN deployments 
      ([RFC5251]), and the previous scenario can be seen to be a special 
      case of this scenario where the two address spaces are 
      complementary. In this deployment, the source EN is aware of the 
      addresses for itself, the ingress CN, the egress CN, and the 
      destination EN in the address space of the core network. It may 
      also have full visibility into the core network, but this is not a 
      requirement.  

      In this scenario, the ENs are responsible for performing address 
      mapping between the overlay network's addresses for the ENs, and 
      the core network's addresses for the same nodes and/or its TE 
      links. A typical deployment may assign addresses in the core 
      network address space for the EN and/or its TE links at the EN 
      side, so that EN can use these addresses to communicate with the 
      core network for UNI connection provisioning.  

      In this deployment, a single end-to-end RSVP-TE session can still 
      be utilized from source EN to destination EN. 

   3. ENs do not have any knowledge of the core address space, or do not 
      support the address space the core network is used (e.g., ENs do 
      not support IPv6 that is used by the core network), ENs will have 
      no visibility into the core network.  

      In this scenario, the ingress CN is responsible for mapping 
      addresses to the core address space and for filling in any 
      additional routing information. A typical deployment may assign

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-uni-app-02.txt                     October 2011 


      addresses in the overlay address space for the ingress CN and/or 
      its TE links at the CN side, so that the EN can use overlay 
      addresses to reach the ingress CN and to identify the destination 
      EN. 

      In this deployment the end-to-end connectivity must be created 
      either using "session stitching" (see Section 5.2) or "session 
      shuffling" (see Section 5.3). 

    

3. UNI Auto Discovery 

   When the end-to-end connection is set up across the core network it 
   must be targeted at the destination CN so that it can be extended to 
   the destination EN. This means that either the source EN must know 
   the identity of the destination CN to which the destination EN is 
   attached, or the source CN must know this information. This requires 
   some form of "discovery" (possibly including configuration), and 
   depending on the addressing scheme in use (see Section 2) will 
   require address mapping to be performed by the source EN or the 
   source CN. 

   The discovery problem may be exacerbated when the a variety of 
   services may be requested since the source EN will need to know the 
   capabilities and available resources on the link between the 
   destination CN and the destination EN. It could discover this by 
   attempting to set up a connection and by drawing conclusions from the 
   connection setup failures, but this is not efficient. Furthermore, in 
   the case of a dual-homed destination EN (such as EN2 in Figure 1), a 
   choice of destination CN must be made, and that choice may be 
   influenced by the capabilities and available resources on the CN-EN 
   links leading to the destination EN. 

   If the UNI is applied in L1VPN scenario, the auto discovery of UNI 
   using OSPFv2 is provided in [RFC5252]. A new L1VPN LSA is introduced 
   to advertise the L1VPN information via the L1VPN info TLV and the TE 
   information of the CE-PE link (in the language of UNI, it's the EN-CN 
   link) via the TE link TLV. 

    

4. UNI Path Computation 

   End-to-end UNI path computation includes three parts: the selection 
   of the source UNI link, the path computation inside the core network 
   and the selection of the destination UNI link. 
 
 
Zhang                    Expires April 2012                    [Page 7] 

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-uni-app-02.txt                     October 2011 


   The selection of UNI links may not necessary in some scenarios. One 
   example is in case of single-homing with only one UNI link between EN 
   and CN, and another example is manual selection of UNI link when the 
   service is requested. In such cases, the CN to which the source EN is 
   attached, or the path Computation Element (PCE) ([RFC4655]) which is 
   responsible for the core network, can perform the path computation 
   across the core network when the UNI signaling request is sent from 
   the source EN to the source CN.  

4.1. UNI Link Selection 

   This document is specific to the overlay architectural model to the 
   source EN which does not have the topology and TE information of the 
   core network. Therefore, in the case of multi-homing (i.e., the 
   source EN is connected to more than one CN), the source EN does not 
   have enough information to make a correct choice among all the UNI 
   links between itself and the core network for an optimal end-to-end 
   connection. 

   In this case, a PCE whose computation domain covers both the core 
   network and the ENs attached to it can be used. Note that the GMPLS 
   UNI predates PCE and hence a PCE was not available to solve this 
   problem in early GMPLS UNI deployments. The PCE that has the topology 
   and TE information of the core network can use the UNI discovery 
   mechanism described in Section 3 to learn the EN-CN relationship and 
   the TE information of the UNI links, and therefore has the ability to 
   select the optimal UNI link for the connection.  

   Figure 2 shows the procedure of UNI path computation using a single 
   PCE with visibility into both networks. When the UNI path computation 
   request is received, the PCE can help the source EN to compute the 
   end-to-end route of the UNI connection based on routing information 
   it learned, so that the source EN can create the UNI connection using 
   the optimal UNI links. 

   Alternatively, the path can be computed by cooperating PCEs, as shown 
   in Figure 3. The source EN does not experience any difference in 
   behavior in that it sends its computation request to its local PCE, 
   and receives a response telling it what path to use. However, the 
   local PCE may not be aware of the topology of the core network and 
   may need to contact a second PCE to supply the missing information.

   If confidentiality of the topology within the core network needs to 
   be preserved, the Path Key Subobject (PKS) can be used for either 
   approach outlined here (see [RFC5520] and [RFC5553]). In the PCRep 
   message returned to EN1, the Confidential Path Segment (CPS) (i.e., 
   CN4-CN5-CN6) is encoded as a PKS by the PCE. Therefore, the EN1 only 
   learns the selected UNI link from PCE. When receiving the UNI 
   signaling carrying the PKS from EN1, CN4 can request the PCE to 
   decode the PKS and then continue to create the connection. 

   Note that in both cases the PCE should be visible to the ENs and 
   there should be control channel between PCE and EN for the 
   transmission of PCEP messages. An alternative implementation could be 
   that the PCE is located inside each CN to which the source EN is 
   attached, so that the source EN can use the UNI control channel to 
   send and receive the PCEP messages. 

    

5. UNI Path Provisioning 

   The basic GMPLS UNI application is to provide end-to-end connections 
   between edge-nodes through a core network via the overlay model. 

5.1. Flat Model 

   The edge-nodes may have the same switching capability and switching 
   capacity as the nodes in the core network. In this case, one single 
   end-to-end RSVP session through the edge-nodes and a series of core-
   nodes can be used to create the connection, which forms a flat LSP 
   model, as shown in Figure 4.

   If the edge-nodes and their attached core-nodes share the same 
   address space, or the ENs can perform address mapping into the core 
   network address space, the GMPLS signaling described in [RFC3471], 
   [RFC3473] and other related standards, with  special ERO and RRO

   processing as described in [RFC4208], can be used to create a 
   connection. 

5.2. Stitching Model 

   Alternatively, the stitching mechanism described in [RFC5150] can be 
   used to create an LSP segment (S-LSP) between the ingress and the 
   egress CN, and to stitch the end-to-end UNI connection to the created 
   S-LSP, as shown in Figure 5.

                        Figure 5 - Stitching model 

5.3. Session Shuffling Model 

   The session shuffling approach ([RFC5251]) is a hybrid of the flat 
   model and the stitching model described in the previous two sections. 
   In this approach a single end-to-end session is established, but as 
   the signaling messages pass through the ingress and egress CNs, 
   address mapping is performed on all addresses carried by the messages 
   to place the addresses into the correct address spaces. The ERO and 
   RRO would normally be stripped (as previously discussed) but the 
   important session identifiers (the source and destination addresses) 
   are changed giving the impression that the session identifiers have 
   been changed. 

5.4. Hierarchy Model 

   In case that the ENs and the CNs have the same switching capability, 
   a tunnel between the ingress and egress core-nodes can be provisioned. 
   The tunnel may have a larger capacity than the end-to-end UNI 
   connection, which may depend on the policies configured at the 
   ingress of the core network. The end-to-end connection can be nested 
   into the tunnel, which forms the LSP hierarchy.

   Another case is that the edge-nodes have different switching 
   capabilities with the core network. In such a case, the LSP hierarchy 
   model should also be used.

                        Figure 6 - Hierarchy model 

   In the hierarchy model, the end-to-end connection can be divided into 
   three hops: one for each UNI link and one hop across the core network. 
   The core network tunnel can be pre-provisioned via network planning, 
   or triggered by the UNI signal. For the latter case, the [RFC5212], 
   [RFC6001] and other multi-layer network related standards are 
   possible to be used to create the hierarchical LSP. 

    

6. UNI Recovery 

   One of the significant uses of GMPLS is to provide recovery 
   mechanisms for connections, which is also needed in many UNI 
   scenarios.  

6.1. End-to-end Recovery 

   In the case of multi-homing, UNI end-to-end recovery is possible. As 
   shown in Figure 7, the working path (W) and the protection path (P) 
   are disjoint from each other not only inside the core network, but 
   also at both the source and destination sides of the UNI. Mechanisms 
   need to be provided to ensure the selection of disjoint working and 
   backup paths.

6.1.1. Serial Provisioning of Working & Protection Path 

   In the case that the working path is computed and created before the 
   protection path, path computation needs to compute a disjoint (or 
   maximally disjoint) protection path given this existing working path. 

   If the information concerning the working path segment traversing the 
   core network is known by the EN without considering the 
   confidentiality, then the EN can easily use the RRO to collect the 
   working path information, and use the XRO to exclude the working path 
   when creating the protection path, as described in [RFC4874]. 

   But in most cases, in order to preserve the confidentiality of 
   topology within the core network, the information of path segment 
   traversing the core network should be hidden from the EN. In such 
   case, the RRO & XRO mechanism in [RFC4874] cannot be used. An 
   alternative would be to only collect the Shared Risk Group (SRG) 
   information but not the full path information. This is because the 
   SRG information is normally less confidential than the information of 
   node ID and link ID. 

   In an application scenario where a PCE is involved inside the core 
   network, then the Path Key mechanism can be used. The confidential 
   path segment, i.e., the working path segment traversing the core 
   network, is encoded as a PKS by the PCE when computing the working 
   path. This PKS can be brought to the source EN, so when it request 
   that the PCE compute a protection path, the PKS can be used to 
   exclude the working path segment inside the core network. 

   [RFC5520] provides a mechanism to hide the CPS using PKS in the PCEP 
   message, while [RFC5553] makes extensions to RSVP-TE to carry the PKS 
   in ERO and RRO objects. It is required that the PKS should also be

   allowed to be carried in the XRO in both PCEP message and RSVP-TE 
   signaling. 

    

6.1.2. Concurrent Computation of Working & Protection Path 

   Alternatively, the working and protection path can be computed at the 
   same time (e.g., by PCE or by one of the CNs to which the source EN 
   is attached).  

   [PCE-GMPLS] allows requesting the PCE for path computation with 
   specified protection type defined in [RFC4872]. Therefore, it's 
   possible that the source EN requests the edge CN or PCE to compute 
   both the working and the protection path at the same time. At this 
   time, the disjunction problem can be resolved inside the path 
   computation server. 

   Same as described in the previous section, the path segment 
   traversing the core network can be encoded as a PKS if 
   confidentiality is requested. 

    

6.2. Segment Recovery 

   The UNI connection may only request protection inside the core 
   network, especially in case of single-homing. One UNI segment 
   protection example is shown in Figure 8.

   the SERO object is introduced for the explicit control of the 
   protection LSP between the branch node and the merge node. 

   However, due to the overlay model, the source EN may not have the 
   information concerning the CN to which the destination EN is attached. 
   In other words, the source EN does not know which node is the merge 
   node of the UNI segment protection, so the SERO object cannot be used 
   to request the edge CN for the UNI segment recovery. Therefore, 
   segment recovery may not be controlled explicitly by the source EN. 

    

7. UNI Call 

   The Call is a fundamental component of the ASON model [G.8080]. It is 
   used to maintain the association between one or more user 
   applications and the network to control the set-up, release, 
   modification and maintenance of sets of connections. In simple cases, 
   the Call and Connection can be established at the same time and in a 
   strict one-to-one ratio. In this case, Call signaling is simple and 
   requires only minor extensions to connection signaling. However, if 
   Calls are to be handled separately from Connections, or if more than 
   one Connection can be associated with a single Call, additional Call 
   signaling is required. 

   The GMPLS Call, defined in [RFC4974], provides a mechanism to 
   negotiate agreement between endpoints possibly in cooperation with 
   the nodes that provide access to the network. Typically the GMPLS 
   Call can be applied in the UNI scenario for access link capability 
   exchange, policy, authorization, security, and so on. 

7.1. Exchange of UNI Link Information 

   It is possible that the TE attributes of the access link (i.e., the 
   UNI link) are not shared across the core network. So the source EN 
   may not have the TE information of the destination access link as 
   well as the capability of the destination EN. For example, in case of 
   TDM network, the Virtual Concatenation (VCAT) and Link Capacity 
   Adjustment Scheme (LCAS) capability of the destination EN may not be 
   known.  

   In this case, the source EN can raise a Call carrying the 
   LINK_CAPABILITY object to have a capability exchange with the 
   destination EN, as described in [RFC4974]. 



 
 
Zhang                    Expires April 2012                   [Page 15] 

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-uni-app-02.txt                     October 2011 


7.2. Control of Call Route 

   When applying the Call, it's possible that there are multiple core 
   network domains between the source EN (Call initiator) and the 
   destination EN (Call terminator), or there is more than one Call 
   manager in the core network (e.g., in the multi-homing scenario where 
   the CNs to which the ENs are attached act as the Call managers). 

   In the both cases, when establishing the Call, there may be multiple 
   alternative routes for the Call message to reach the destination EN. 
   One can simply use the hop-by-hop manner (i.e., each Call manager 
   determines the next Call manager to which the Call message will be 
   sent by itself) to control the path of the Call. 

   However, in the practical deployment of UNI Call, commercial and 
   policy motivations normally play an important role in selecting the 
   Call route, especially in the multi-domain scenario. In this case, 
   the hop-by-hop manner is not practical because the route of the Call 
   needs to be pre-determined in consideration of commercial and policy 
   factors before establishing the Call. 

   Therefore, it is desirable to allow full control of the Call by the 
   source EN. That is, the source EN can identify the full Call route 
   and signal it explicitly, so that the Call message can be forwarded 
   along the desired route. Moreover, the management plane needs to be 
   able to identify the Call route explicitly as an instruction to the 
   source EN. 

    

8. UNI Multicast 

   Data plane multicasting is supported in the existing Traffic-
   Engineering networks. GMPLS provides extensions to the RSVP-TE to 
   support provisioning of point-to-multipoint (P2MP) TE LSPs via 
   control plane, as described in [RFC4461] and [RFC4875].  

   In the scenarios where the overlay architectural model is used, it's 
   a requirement to transport signals from one source EN to multiple 
   destination ENs which are located in other overlay networks. One 
   could create multiple point-to-point connections between the source 
   EN and each destination EN, but it will be a waste of bandwidth 
   resource of both UNI links and the core network.  

   Therefore, there are some scenarios required to support point-to-
   multipoint (P2MP) TE LSPs from one source EN to multiple leaf ENs.

8.1. UNI Multicast Connection Model 

   There are two cases for the UNI multicast. For the first case, only 
   the ingress and egress CNs in the core network support the multicast. 
   The core network has to provide multiple P2P connections between 
   ingress CN and each egress CN for the end-to-end UNI multicast, as 
   shown in Figure 9.

            Figure 9 - Only ingress/egress CNs support multicast 

    

   For example, in the PSC over TDM multi-layer scenario, the 
   ingress/egress CNs may have the packet multicast capability and 
   therefore can adapt the packets from EN into multiple TDM connections 
   inside the core network, while other CNs inside the core network may 
   only support point-to-point (P2P) TDM connections.  

   In another case, all the CNs in the core network can support 
   multicast, so that the core network can create a P2MP LSP to provide 
   the end-to-end UNI multicast, as shown in Figure 10.

                   Figure 10 - All CNs support multicast 

   For example, in the Ethernet over OTN scenario, if the core network 
   can support ODU0 multicast, then an ODU0 P2MP LSP can be created 
   inside the core network to carry the client Gigabit Ethernet (GE) 
   signal for the ENs.  

   Note that the branching of the multicast may also happen at the 
   source EN in the multi-homing scenario. In this case, each branch of 
   the source EN uses a separate UNI link connecting the source EN to 
   the core network. For each UNI branch, the connection model inside 
   the core network is the same as described in this section. 

8.2. UNI Multicast Connection Provisioning 

   The four UNI connection provisioning models, as described in Section 
   5, should also be applied in the UNI multicast scenario. 

   For the flat model, one end-to-end P2MP session as described in 
   [RFC4875] can be used directly to create the P2MP LSP from source EN 
   to leaf ENs. 

   For the stitching model, multiple P2P LSP segments or one P2MP LSP 
   segment between the ingress CN and each egress CNs needs to be 
   created and then stitched to the UNI P2MP LSP. GMPLS UNI signaling 
   should have the capability to convey the multicast information by 
   using stitching model.

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-uni-app-02.txt                     October 2011 


   For the session shuffling model, one end-to-end P2MP session can be 
   used to create the P2MP LSP, with an address mapping performed at 
   both ingress and egress CNs. 

   For the hierarchy model, multiple P2P LSP tunnels or one P2MP LSP 
   tunnel between the ingress CN and each egress CNs needs be triggered 
   by the UNI signaling for creating P2MP LSP. GMPLS UNI signaling 
   should have the capability to convey the multicast information by 
   using hierarchy model.  

    

9. Security Considerations 

   [RFC5920] provides an overview of security vulnerabilities and 
   protection mechanisms for the GMPLS control plane, which is 
   applicable to this document. 

   The details of the specific security measures of the overlay network 
   architectural model are provided in [RFC4208], which permits the core 
   network to filter out specific RSVP objects to hide its topology from 
   the EN.  

   Furthermore, if PCE is used, the security issues described in 
   [RFC4655] and other related standards should also be considered. 

   Additionally, when the PKS mechanism is applied, the security issues 
   can be dealt with using [RFC5520] and [RFC5553].
