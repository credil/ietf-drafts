             Securing DHCPv6 By Identity Based Cryptography
                         draft-zhou-dhc-ibc-00

Abstract

   This document provides security methods based on identity based
   cryptography to protect DHCP messages.  Identity based cryptography
   is a special kind of public key cryptography.  Specifically, an
   authetication protocol based on IBS (identity based signature)
   algorithms is proposed.  A key distribution method adopting IBE (
   identity based encryption) algorithms is also proposed, where key is
   used as a shared secret in calculating authentication information
   according to authentication protocol specified in RFC 3315.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  DHCP

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCP) is a client/
   server protocol that enables DHCP servers to pass configuration
   parameters such as IPv6 network addresses to IPv6 nodes, namely DHCP
   clients [RFC3315]

   To obtain an IPv6 network address among other configuration
   parameters, the client and server are normally involved in an
   exchange of four messages unless Rapid Commit option is
   used[RFC3315].  The client firstly sends a Solicit message to
   All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers, a reserved link-scoped multicast
   address, to find available DHCP servers.  Any server that can meet
   the client's requirements responds with an Advertise message.  The
   client then chooses one of the servers and sends a Request message to
   the server asking for confirmed assignment of addresses and other
   configuration information.  The server responds with a Reply message
   that contains the confirmed addresses and configuration.

   To obtain other configuration parameters except IPv6 addresses, the
   client and server are involved in an exchange of two
   messages[RFC3315].  The client firstly sends an Information-Request
   message to the All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address.
   The qualified servers respond with a Reply message containing the
   configuration information for the client.

   There are some other situations in which exchanges of two messages
   are invoked, e.g., Confirm/Reply, Renew/Reply, Rebind/Reply, Release/
   Reply, Decline/Reply.

1.2.  Security Threats and Defense Methods

   Among the security threats to DHCP are attacks involving with
   identity masquerading and message tampering.  Attacker may establish
   a malicious server with the intent of providing incorrect
   configuration information to the client ,the malicious server may
   also mount a denial of service attack through misconfiguration of the
   client that causes all network communication from the client to fail.
   Attacker may be an invalid client masquerading as a valid client
   aiming for theft of service, or to circumvent auditing for any number
   of nefarious purposes[RFC3315].

   To defend against the above attacks, DHCPv6, like DHCPv4, defined
   Authentication Option[RFC3118][RFC3315] which include fields of
   authentication protocol types, algorithm types, and authentication
   information, to provide authentication for DHCP messages.

   In DHCPv6, two authentication protocols are specified: "delayed
   authentication" and "reconfigure key authentication".  They both
   require a shared secret key between client and server and use HMAC-
   MD5 algorithm to generate a message authentication code of the whole
   DHCP message[RFC3315].  However the distribution of shared secret key
   is unspecified.  Some work proposed to distribute shared secret key
   by AAA server
   [I-D.tschofenig-pana-bootstrap-rfc3118][I-D.yegin-eap-boot-rfc3118] .

   Recently, new authentication protocols based on public key
   cryptographic techniques, specifically digital signatures, were
   proposed [I-D.ietf-dhc-secure-dhcpv6][I-D.xu-dhc-cadhcp].  The
   advantage of these protocols is not having to distribute shared
   secret keys, but additional long options carrying CGA parameters or
   public keys are required to send.

   In this document, we propose to adopt identity based cryptography
   (IBC)[sh84] to authenticate DHCP messages.  Identity based
   cryptography is a special public key cryptographic technique in which
   user identities are used as the public keys, thus users are not
   needed to send certificate or public key.  Specifically, we propose a
   new authentication protocol to authenticate DHCP messages by identity
   based signatures(IBS), e.g., [Hess02][CC03], and a new method of
   distributing shared secret key between client and server, by adopting
   identikit based encryption(IBE),e.g., [RFC5091][RFC6508] and IBS.

                       authentication option

   Replay detection    The replay detection information for the RDM

   ID type             The identity type used in calculation of IBS
                       signature.  ID type=0 indicates using DUID value.
                       ID type=1 indicates using ID in IBC_ID Option.

   IBS Signature       The signature of the information to be
                       authenticated, output of the identity based
                       signature algorithm identified by algorithm.

   DHCP Client or Server sends every message along with a IBS signature.
   The identity of signer comes either from the accompanying DUID if the
   ID type is zero, or from the accompanying IBC_ID option otherwise.
   The public parameters or the URL where the public parameters can be
   found in IBC_PARAMETER option.

   IBC_ID option and IBC_PARAMETER option MAY only be sent once with the
   first DHCP message to inform the peer of the identity and public
   parameter.  Once client and server have knowledge of the information,
   the two options are not required to send again.  When DHCP client or
   server receives a DHCP message with IBS signature, it firstly checks
   whether the public parameters or the URL storing the public
   parameters are trusted.  The reciever discards the message if the
   public parameters are found untrusted, otherwise it continues to
   verify the IBS signature.  If the IBS signature is not valid, it
   discards the message, otherwise it accepts the message.


5.  Distribution of Shared Secret Key

   What is proposed here is not a new authentication protocol, but a
   method of distributing shared secret key between client and server,
   specifically from server to client.

   DHCP Client sends a DHCP message including an
   IBC_ENCRYPTED_KEY_Option with enckey-len zero and the following two
   fields (encrypted key field and signature field) null, to inform the
   server that it requests to send a key through the method defined
   here.  Authentication Option defined in [RFC3315] is also included to

   inform server the preferred authentication protocol and algorithm.
   The authentication protocols MUST be those based on shared secret,
   e.g., delayed authentication.

   DHCP Server replies with a DHCP message including an
   IBC_ENCRYPTED_KEY_Option , optionally including IBC_ID and
   IBC_PARAMETER options.  If ID type in IBC_ENCRYPTED_KEY_ Option is
   zero, DUID of server is also required to send.  To generate an
   IBC_ENCRYPTED_KEY_Option, server firstly generates a random key,
   stores it along with client's DUID, then encrypts the key with
   client's identity whose type has been indicated in the recieved
   IBC_ENCRYPTED_KEY_Option from client, the encryption algorithm
   following the enc id in the client's IBC_ENCRYPTED_KEY_Option (if it
   is acceptable to server) ; then calculates an IBS signature on the
   whole DHCP message excluding signature field and authentication
   information, using the private key corresponding to server's
   identity, the signature algorithm following the sig id in the
   client's IBC_ENCRYPTED_KEY_Option (if it is acceptable to server).

   After DHCP client receives the reply including an
   IBC_ENCRYPTED_KEY_Option from server, it firstly checks if IBC public
   parameters or URL storing the public parameter is trusted, if not,
   discards the message, otherwise verifies the IBS signature against
   server's identity and IBCpublic parameters.  If the IBS signature is
   not valid, discards the message, otherwise decrypts the IBE encrypted
   key to obtain the shared secret key.

   After DHCP client has obtained the shared secret key, it generates
   authentication information from the shared secret key according to
   the protocol and algorithm indicated in Authentication Option.  DHCP
   server verifies DHCP client's message and generates its message as
   exactly specified in [RFC3315].


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines three new options which must be assigned Option
   Type values within the option numbering space for DHCPv6 messages by
   IANA :

   Name: IBC_PARAMETER Option;

   Value: TBA.

   Name: IBC_ENCRYPTED_KEY_Option;

   Value: TBA.

   Description: see Section Section 3.3.

   This document also defines a new Authentication protocol that must be
   assigned protocol number by IANA:

   Name: IBS_Auth;

   Value: TBA.

   Description: see Section Section 4.

   The values of IBE id and IBS id defined in IBC_ENCRYPTED_KEY_Option
   are also required to be assigned by IANA.


7.  Security Considerations

   This document considers the security of DHCP messages, specifically
   message authentication between DHCP client and server directly or
   through DHCP relay .  The security of DHCP message flows between DHCP
   relay and DHCP server is not considered here.

   The authentication protocol provided in this document adopts identity
   based signature without certificate, so it is crucial to keep the
   private key corresponding to the identity secret, and the trust
   anchor is in the IBC public parameters or the URL storing the IBC
   public parameters.

   The distribution of shared secret key method provided in this
   document adopts both identity based signature and identity based
   encryption, the shared secret key is encrypted by an IBE algorithm,
   then the whole message including the encryption is authenticated by
   an IBS algorithm.  The security also relies on the secrecy of the
   private keys corresponding to the identities and the trust in the IBC
   public parameters and URL where IBV public parameters are published.
