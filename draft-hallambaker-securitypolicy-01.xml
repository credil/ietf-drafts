        This document describes a format for distributing collections of 
        security policy statments as static documents.
      </t>
      <t>
        Individual security policy statements are expressed in a HTTP
        compatible header syntax. Lists of security policy statements
        are signed for exchange. Strong references to 
        static data objects are formed using Named Information (ni)
        URI specifiers.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        Recent compromises of critical infrastructure have highlighted the weaknesses
        that result from the fact that on the Internet, security is an option, not
        the default.
      </t>
      <t>
        Security Policy provides a mechanism for advising parties of the minimum
        degree of security that they should accept for a communication and thus
        preventing downgrade attacks.
      </t>
      <section title="Requirements">
        <t>
          Security Policy statements provide a mechanism for advising parties of
          the risk of a downgrade attack and the enforcement actions that are
          appropriate based on the quality of the security policy information
          available.
        </t>
        <t>
          While the natural inclination of security specialists is to advise that
          a security policy violation always result in a hard failure with the
          corresponding transaction being aborted, this approach imposes a 
          high cost for false positives. Previous attempts to employ security
          policy data (e.g. in DKIM) have faced objections from those fearing
          that the false positive rate will be unacceptably high.
        </t>
        <t>
          Recent events have demonstrated that the value of reporting a security
          policy violation is considerably higher than than security policy
          enforcement on a limited scale. While security policy enforcement has the
          potential to protect the individual Internet user, reporting a
          violation to the appropriate parties has the potential to protect the
          entire community of Internet users.
        </t>
        <section title="Risks">

          <section title="Protocol Downgrade Attack">
            <t>
              In a protocol downgrade attack the attacker causes client software
              to communicate en-clair when TLS or some other security enhancement
              is offered.
            </t>
          </section>
          <section title="CA Downgrade Attack">
            <t>
              In a CA downgrade attack the attacker applies for a certificate from
              a different issuer to that authorized by the Domain name holder or
              for a category of certificate with lest strict validation requirements.
            </t>
          </section>
          <section title="Use of Revoked Certificate">
            <t>
              Although PKIX specifies two mechanisms for certificate status checking,
              many clients will accept certificates when access to the certificate
              status checking infrastructure fails.
            </t>
            <section title="Use of Expired Certificate">
              <t>
                Although use of expired certificates is discouraged, the frequency
                with which use of expired certificates occurs from administrative
                oversight prevents strict enforcement.
              </t>
            </section>

          </section>

        </section>

        <section title="Security Policy Origination">
          <t>
            Security policy statements may be obtained from explicit statements
            by domain name holders or obtained heuristically from observation
            of the network.
          </t>
          <section title="Explicit">
            <t>
              A domain name holder MAY specify security policy explicitly through
              publication mechanisms that include:
            </t>
            <t>
              <list>
                <t>
                  Publishing statements in Security Policy Distribution Format
                </t>
                <t>
                  Security Policy Statements in HTTP headers
                </t>
                <t>
                  Security Policy Statements in DNS records
                </t>
                <t>
                  Out of band contact with remediation parties.
                </t>
                <t>
                  Statements to a Certification Authority at certificate issue.
                </t>
              </list>
            </t>
            <t>
              Even though a statement is explicit, an enforcement point may
              only learn of its existence through heuristic means. For example
              observing DNS traffic, use of Web crawlers and HTTPS inspection.
            </t>
            <t>
              Publication of an explicit Security policy Statement requires a
              considerable commitment of time and effort for a large site.
            </t>
          </section>
          <section title="Heuristic">
            <t>
              Security policy data MAY also be determined heuristically by
              observation of network traffic. If a site has been using a particular
              CA for many years and a certificate is suddenly detected from an
              obscure issuer, questions may be asked.
            </t>
            <t>
              While the quality of heuristic data may fall short of that
              required to abort transactions by itself, it can still
              provide a useful basis for reporting potential violations and
              for enforcement when combined with data from other sources.
            </t>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section title="Distribution">
          <t>
            Security Policy Statements set expectations for security, thus
            overriding the Internet default security expectation of 'none'.
          </t>
          <t>
            Security Policy Statements may be used to protect individual
            Internet users through client enforcement and communities of
            users through reporting.
          </t>
          <t>
            A Security Policy Statments are designed to permit distribution
            through a variety of means including:
          </t>
          <t>
            <list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="Embedded in application code">
                Many clients have security policy statements embedded into
                the application code. For example code to look for specific
                certificates that are known to be invalid. While this is a
                highly effective means of enforcement it requires users to
                upgrade their client software in response to every compromise.
              </t>
              <t hangText="Local Configuration Files">
                Some client applications support local security policy
                configuration but the configuration options are limited
                and there is no standard format for distributing the
                configuration. A standard for specifying Security Policy
                potentially allows every client application to enforce
                the same security policy whether it be a Web browser,
                mail client or Web Services application.
              </t>
              <t hangText="Data driven updates">
                Data driven update of security policy overcomes the
                principal limitation of security policy distribution through
                embedded code and local configuration files. Security Policy
                can be updated in response to threats and reliably enforced
                without the need to perform online queries for each network
                operation. The principal disadvantage being that it is only
                possible to push out security policy statements for selected
                of domains.
              </t>
              <t hangText="Protocol Headers">
                Distribution of security policy in protocol headers overcomes the
                scaling limitation of data driven updates but only provides
                security after first contact. If the attacker can compromise
                the first contact they can compromise all subsequent contacts.
              </t>
              <t hangText="DNS Records">
                DNS provides a scalable means for distribution of security policy
                statements through realtime query and response. If the relying
                party can ensure a connection to a trustworthy DNS service, they
                can protect their security but an attacker that can block access to
                a trustworthy DNS service can force the relying party to choose between
                security and availability.
              </t>
              <t hangText="Irregular">
                Security Policy distribution is hard because the adversaries
                encountered to date include nation state actors with complete
                control of the local network infrastructure. It is thus not
                possible to address every possible need in a standard based
                approach since the adversary  can block deployment of the
                necessary standards.
              </t>
              <t>
                It follows that standards based techniques SHOULD be
                supplemented by resort to irregular methods where necessary.

            Each distribution mechanism provides a tradeoff between scope,

            The formats described in this document is targetted at distribution
            of Local Security Policy and as data driven updates. With appropriate

        <t>
          Security Policy Statements are used to inform relying parties

          permitting relying parties to avoid downgrade attacks.
        </t>
        <t>

            The TLS statement provides a control against protocol downgrade

            A security policy statement that advises relying parties
            that security is always offers permits a 'promiscuous
            security approach' to be adopted in which clients are
            advised that the default mode of connection SHOULD
            be with TLS security enhancements.

            When a domain is in the scope of multiple statements

            A security policy statement MAY specify a user interface action that
            relying parties are advised to take when a security policy
            violation is detected. This may range from advising the 
            relying party that they MUST ignore the violation to 
            advising them that they SHOULD block all communication.
          </t>
          <t>
            A security policy statement MAY provide a means of reporting 
            security policy violations. While client enforcement of security
            policy can protect one user, reporting of a violation has the potential
            to help protect the whole community. Such reporting is orthogonal to
            the relying party action.
          </t>
          <t>
            The following statement specifies that relying parties
            MUST ignore security policy violations for all hosts in 
            *.example.com except to report them in machine readable format
            to the specified reporting address. An action statement of 
            this form would typically be used during beta testing of a
            security policy deployment.

            Although X.509v3 and PKIX specify mechanisms for advising
            relying parties of the status of certificates, these
            approaches must by necessity rely on access to the information
            sources used to distribute the status information (CRLs,
            OCSP tokens).

          <t>
            Emergency Certificate Revocation advises a relying party 
            that a certificate has been found to be invalid and there is
            a very high risk that the certificate will be used for 
            a malicious purpose.
