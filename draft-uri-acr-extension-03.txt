1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) scheme
   "acr".  The "acr" URI describes an anonymous reference, that can be
   mapped to a resource or user.  There are multiple situations where
   the true identity of a user or a resources can not be disclosed.  The
   "acr" URI is a globally unique identifier ( "name" ) only; it does
   not describe the steps necessary to reach the user or the device.
   However it can contain a parameter indication what body or
   organisation that could resolve it.  It is intended for privacy
   protection, where a user trusts a translating party, that can route
   or forward the request or message to the true user or resource.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and
   indicate the requirements levels for compliant implementations.


3.  URI syntax

   The URI is defined using AB-NF (Augmented Backus-Naur Form) as
   described in RFC 5234 [RFC5234] and uses elements from the core
   definitions (appendix A of RFC 5234).

   The syntax definition follows RFC 3986 [RFC3986], indicating the
   actual characters contained in the URI.  If the reserved characters
   "+", ";", "=", and "?" are used as delimiters between components of
   the "tel" URI, they MUST NOT be percent encoded.  These characters
   MUST be percent encoded if they appear in tel URI parameter values.

   Characters other than those in the "reserved" and "unsafe" sets (see
   RFC 3986 [RFC3986] ) are equivalent to their "% HEX HEX" percent
   encoding.

   The "acr" URI has the following syntax:

   The "anonymous-subscriber-identifier" can be created from some
   suitable user or customer data such as, phone number, and validation
   date.  In order to provide anonymisation, this data MUST not be
   included unchanged within the ACR.  Rather it MUST be encrypted,
   hashed, represented by a look-up reference or otherwise obfuscated.
   The issuing provider is responsible for unreferencing the ACR to the
   user or resource.  For example the SHA-256 algorithm can hash the
   sensitive data:

   SHA256("")= e3b0c442 98fc1c14 9afbf4c8 996fb924 27ae41e4 649b934c

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                  July 2011


   In order to know who issued the identifier, the Network Code or
   domain name MUST be included, for cross-operator identification and
   to ensure it is known which entity can deference the ACR.  In
   addition a network country identifier MUST be provided (either as
   part of the network code, or separately) to avoid confusion where
   networks operate in multiple countries.  A URI for ACR documentation
   MAY be included; for example, to discover further meta-data, or to
   list the service endpoints which can consume the ACR.

   The "network code" (ncc) is for mobile networks a concatenation of
   "mobile country code" (MCC) and "mobile network code" (MNC) as
   defined in ITU-T RECOMMENDATION E.212

   As an example of ncc for Vodafone in UK, consists of MCC=234 and
   MNC=15 would concatenate to ncc=23415

   The acr-type indicates if the ACR is a static type or a temporary
   type.


4.  Examples

   acr:0123456890123456789 This URI points to a user. for network
   internal use only since the network code is not provided

   acr:0123456890123456789;ncc=123 This URI points to a user belonging
   to network 123

   acr:0123456890123456789;ncc=23415;type=DYNA This temporal URI points
   to a user or group of users and can be resolved by the Vodafone
   mobile network in UK.

   acr:0123456890123456789;ncc=123 This URI points to a group of users
   belonging to network 123.

   Note that the fact that more than one user is represented is not
   intrinsic to the acr but only known to the issuing network.

   acr:0123456890123456789;domain=example.com This URI points to a user
   belonging in domain example.com


5.  Rationale

5.1.  Privacy policies

   Existing privacy policies and legislation restrict the sharing of
   certain user identifiers, such as the MSISDN, since it may be used to



Jakobsson & Smith       Expires January 14, 2012                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                  July 2011


   breach a user's privacy (unauthorized location lookup, cold calling,
   SMS Spam etc.).  An ACR prevents such identifiers from being
   circulated.

5.2.  Cookie support

   Cookie support is inconsistent across mobile devices.  An ACR can
   help identify a returning mobile user to a Website, and hence
   facilitate the provisioning of a personalized service based on
   previous preferences and activity.

5.3.  Sharing identity

   Mobile, broadband and other access networks do not typically share a
   user identifier.  The ACR is not bound to a particular access network
   and can hence be used to provision user identifiers between networks.

5.4.  Relation to SIP

   The ACR can help the implementation of SIP privacy considerations, as
   detailed in RFC3323 [RFC3323], 'A Privacy Mechanism for the Session
   Initiation Protocol'.  Specifically the ACR can be used as the value
   for the 'anonymous from' header field [section 4.1], and is
   consistent with the recommendation to remove Subject, Call-info,
   Organization, User Agent, Reply-To, In-Reply-To in [section 5.3].

   members, Gautam Hazari and Douglas Robb for their comments and
   suggestions.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes a request to IANA.

   The editors of this draft request the protocol scheme name "acr" to
   be reserved for this RFC.


8.  Security Considerations

   Since the "acr" is used to protect the identity of a user or a device



Jakobsson & Smith       Expires January 14, 2012                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                  July 2011


   the forwarding party must not disclose information that would or can
   be used to reveal the identity of the user.  However the network code
   or domain name will reveal some information of the the "acr"
   affiliation.

   The security considerations parallel those for the tel URI RFC3966
   [RFC3966].

   Web clients and similar tools MUST NOT use the "acr" URI to place
   telephone calls or send messages without the explicit consent of the
   user of that client.  Placing calls or sending messages automatically
   without appropriate user confirmation may incur a number of risks,
   such as those described below:

   o  Calls or messages may incur costs.

   o  The URI may be used to place malicious or annoying calls.

   o  A call will take the user's phone line off-hook, thus preventing
      its use.

   o  A call may reveal the user's possibly unlisted phone number to the
      remote host in the caller identification data and may allow the
      attacker to correlate the user's phone number with other
      information, such as an e-mail or IP address.

   This is particularly important for "acr" URIs embedded in HTML links,
   as a malicious party may hide the true nature of the URI in the link
   text, as in

       <a href="acr:123456">Find free information here</a>
       <a href="acr:123456">Call RFC organization for help</a>

   "acr" URIs may reveal private information, similar to including phone
   numbers as text.  However, the presence of the acr: schema identifier
   may make it easier for an adversary using a search engine to discover
   these numbers, and hence search engines should avoid indexing these
   identifiers.
