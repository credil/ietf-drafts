Internet-Draft     The application/csrattrs Media Type         June 2012


1.  Introduction

   Enrollment over Secure Transport [EST] defines a Certificate
   enrollment protocol that allows client to generate certification
   request and transmit it to a server acting as a Certification
   Authority (CA) or Registration Authority (RA).  The CA then issues a
   Certificate based on the certification request.

   In some cases, the CA may want to include client-provided attributes
   in certificates it issues.  These attributes may describe information
   that is not available to the CA, for instance the MAC address of a
   client's wireless interface might be needed in a certificate used to
   gain access to a wireless medium.  The media type described here
   allows the server to inform the client of a (set of) attribute(s) to
   include, if possible, in its certification request.

   This document defines a URI [RFC3986] that can be used with
   Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) protocol [EST].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terms and concepts of
   [EST] and [RFC2986].

   Attribute
       Any kind of identifying information that can be added to a
       certification request.


2.  Distribution of Attributes

   Attribute request messages MUST be sent through the TLS-protected
   channel [RFC5246] established as part of the [EST] protocol.

   The request MUST be made with an HTTPS GET message to the common path
   to the EST server-- referred to as BASEPATH-- with an OPERATIONPATH
   extension of '/csrattrs'.  For example, if BASEPATH had the value
   arbitary/base then an example URI would be:

       https://example.org/arbitrary/base/csrattrs

   The server MUST reply to the client's HTTPS message with a (set of)

   attribute(s).  Responses to attribute request messsages MUST be
   encoded as content type "application/csrattrs".


3.  Format of the application/csrattrs Body

   The syntax for application/csrattrs body is as follows:

       Csrattrs ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (0..MAX) OF OBJECT IDENTIFIER { }

   A robust application SHOULD output Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER)
   ([X.690]) but MAY use Basic Encoding Rules (BER) ([X.680]).  Data
   produced by DER or BER is 8-bit.  When the transport for the
   application/csrattrs is limited to 7-bit data, a suitable transfer
   encoding MUST be applied in MIME-compatible transports, the base64
   encoding (section 4 of [RFC4648]) SHOULD be used with application/
   csrattrs, although any 7-bit transfer encoding may work.

   Clients MUST encode csrattrs as an empty SEQUENCE OF.  That is, no
   object identifiers are included when the client creates an
   application/csrattrs media type.  For example, it would produce an
   ASN.1 SEQUENCE:

       30 00

   and then base64 encode that ASN.1 SEQUENCE OF nothing to produce:

       MA==

   The resulting request would look like this:


            Content-Type: application/csrattrs; name=attributes
            Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
            Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=attributes

            MA==

   Servers include zero or more object identifiers that they wish the
   client to include in their certification request.  When the server
   encodes csrattrs as an empty SEQUENCE OF it means that the server has
   no attributes it wants in client certification requests.

   For example, if a CA wishes to have a certification request contain
   the MAC address [RFC2397] of a device and the pseudonym [X.520] and
   friendly name [RFC2925] of the holder of the private analog to the
   public key in the certification request, it takes the following
   object identifiers:

   o   macAddress: 1.3.6.1.1.1.1.22

   o   pseudonym: 2.5.4.65

   o   friendlyName: 1.2.840.113549.1.9.20

   and encodes them into an ASN.1 SEQUENCE to produce:

       30 19 06 07 2b 06 01 01 01 01 16 06 03 55 04 41 06 09 2a 86 48 86
       f7 0d 01 09 14

   and then base64 encodes the resulting ASN.1 SEQUENCE to produce:

       MBkGBysGAQEBARYGA1UEQQYJKoZIhvcNAQkU

   The resulting response would look like this:


            Content-Type: application/csrattrs; name=attributes
            Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
            Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=attributes

            MBkGBysGAQEBARYGA1UEQQYJKoZIhvcNAQkU


4.  Receipt of the application/csrattrs Body

   A server that obtains a non-empty SEQUENCE OF SHALL ignore the OBJECT
   IDENTIFIERS in the application/csrattrs media type.

   A client that obtains data using the application/csrattrs media type
   SHALL decode the body of the data, as necessary, and parse the result
   as an ASN.1 SEQUENCE of OBJECT IDENTIFIERS.  An unknown OBJECT
   IDENTIFIER MUST be ignored by the client and SHALL NOT be a reason to
   not produce a certification request.  A client SHOULD include every
   known OBJECT IDENTIFIER it receives in an application/csrattrs media
   type in its certification request with the appropriate value.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA SHALL update the Application Media Types registry with the
   following filled-in template from [RFC4288].

6.  Security Considerations

   There are no real inherent security issues with the content being
   conveyed but an adversary who is able to interpose herself into the
   conversation could exclude attributes that a server may want, include
   attributes that a server may not want, and render meaningless other
   attributes that a server may want.

   For this reason, this mime-type is used over a TLS-protected channel
   established as part of the [EST] protocol. certification request
   protocol whose Security Considerations would apply to the use of this
   mime-type.

   The Security Considerations of [RFC2986] and [EST] apply.
