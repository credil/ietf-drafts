Internet-Draft            Multihoming With NPT6            December 2011


1.  Introduction

   [RFC3582] establishes the following goals for IPv6 site multihoming:

         Redundancy - A site's ability to remain connected to the
         Internet, even when connectivity through one or more of its
         upstream providers fails.

         Transport-Layer Survivability - A site's ability to maintain
         transport-layer sessions across failover and restoration
         events.  During a failover/restoration event, the transport-
         layer session may detect packet loss or reordering, but neither
         of these cause the transport-layer session to fail.

         Load Sharing - The ability of a site to distribute both inbound
         and outbound traffic across its upstream providers.

   [RFC3582] notes that a multihoming solution may require interactions
   with the routing subsystem.  However, multihoming solutions must be
   simple and scalable.  They must not require excessive operational
   effort and must not cause excessive routing table expansion.

   [RFC6296] explains how a site can achieve address independence using
   IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation (NPTv6).  In order to achieve
   address independence, the site assigns an inside address to each of
   its resources (e.g., hosts).  Nodes outside of the site identify
   those same resources using a corresponding Provider Allocated (PA)
   address.

   The site resolves this addressing dichotomy by deploying an NPTv6
   translator between itself and its upstream provider.  The NPTv6
   translator maintains a static, one-to-one mapping between each inside
   address and its corresponding PA address.  That mapping persists
   across flows and over time.

   If the site disconnects from one upstream provider and connects to
   another, it may lose its PA assignment.  However, the site will not
   need to renumber its resources.  It will only need to reconfigure the
   mapping rules on its local NPTv6 translator.

   Section 2.4 of [RFC6296] describes an NPTv6 architecture for sites
   that are homed to multiple upstream providers.  While that
   architecture fulfils many of the goals identified by [RFC3582], it
   does not achieve transport-layer survivability.  Transport-layer
   survivability is not achieved because in this architecture, a PA
   address is useable only when the multi-homed site is directly
   connected to the allocating provider.

Internet-Draft            Multihoming With NPT6            December 2011


   This memo describes an alternative architecture for multihomed sites
   that require transport-layer survivability.  It updates Section 2.4
   of [RFC6296].  In this architecture, PA addresses remain usable, even
   when the multihomed site loses its direct connection to the
   allocating provider.

   The architecture described in this document can be deployed in sites
   that are served by two or more upstream providers.  For the purpose
   of example, this document demonstrates how the architecture can be
   deployed in a site that is served by two upstream providers.

1.1.  Terminology

   The following terms are used in this document:

      inbound packet - A packet that is destined for the multi-homed
      site

      outbound packet - A packet that originates at the multi-homed site
      and is destined for a point outside of the multi-homed site

      NPTv6 inside interface - An interface that connects an NPTv6
      translator to the site

      NPTv6 outside interface- An interface that connects an NPTv6
      translator to an upstream provider


2.  NPTv6 Deployment

   This section demonstrates how NPTv6 can be deployed in order to
   achieve the goals of [RFC3582].

                               Internal Network


                    Figure 1: NPTv6 Multihomed Topology

   In Figure 1, a site attaches all of its assets, including two NPTv6
   translators, to an Internal Network.  NPTv6 #1 is connected to
   Provider Edge (PE) Router #1, which is maintained by Upstream
   Provider #1.  Likewise, NPTv6 #2 is connected to PE Router #2, which
   is maintained by Upstream Provider #2.

   Each upstream provider also maintains a Backup PE Router.  A
   forwarding tunnel connects the loopback interface of Backup PE Router
   #1 to the outside interface of NPTv6 #2.  Likewise, another
   forwarding tunnel connects Backup PE Router #2 to NPTv6 #1.  Network
   operators can select from many encapsulation techniques (e.g., GRE)
   to realize the forwarding tunnel.  Tunnels are not depicted in
   Figure 1.

   In the figure, NPTv6 #1 and NPTv6 #2 are depicted as separate boxes.
   While vendors may produce a separate box to support the NPTv6
   function, they may also integrate the NPTv6 function into a router.

   During periods of normal operation, the Backup PE routers is very
   lightly loaded.  Therefore, a single Backup PE router may back up
   multiple PE routers.  Furthermore, the Backup PE router may be used
   for other purposes (e.g., primary PE router for another customer).

2.2.  Addressing

2.2.1.  Upstream Provider Addressing

   A Regional Internet Registry (RIR) allocates Provider Address Block
   (PAB) #1 to Upstream Provider #1.  From PAB #1, Upstream Provider #1
   allocates two sub-blocks, using them as follows.

   Upstream Provider #1 uses the first sub-block for its internal
   address assignments.  It also uses that sub-block for numbering both
   ends of the interfaces between itself and its customers.

   Upstream Provider #1 uses the second sub-block for address allocation
   to its customers.  We refer to a particular allocation from this sub-
   block as a Customer Network Block (CNB).  A CNB allocated for a
   particular customer must be large enough to provide addressing for
   the customer's entire Internal Network.  In our example, Upstream
   Provider #1 allocates a /60, called CNB #1, to its customer.

   The customer configures translation rules that reference CNB #1 on
   NPTv6 #1 and NPTv6 #2.  This makes selected hosts that are connected
   to the Internal Network accessible using CNB #1 addresses.  See
   Section 2.3 for details.

   In a similar fashion, a Regional Internet Registry (RIR) allocates
   PAB #2 to Upstream Provider #2.  Upstream Provider #2, in turn,
   allocates CNB #2 to the multihomed customer.

2.2.2.  Site Addressing

   The site obtains a Site Address Block (SAB), either from Unique Local
   Address (ULA) [RFC4193] space, or by some other means.  The SAB is as
   large as all of the site's CNBs, combined.  In this example, because
   CNB #1 and CNB #2 are both /60's, the SAB is a /59.

   The site divides its SAB into smaller blocks, with each block being
   exactly as large as one CNB.  It also associates each of the
   resulting sub-blocks with one of its CNBs.  In this example, the site
   divides the SAB into a lower half and an upper half.  It associates
   the lower half of the SAB with CNB #1 and the upper half of the SAB
   with CNB #2.

   Finally, the site assigns one SAB address to each interface that is
   connected to the Internal Network, including the inside interfaces of
   the two NPTv6 translators.  The site also assigns a SAB address to
   the loopback interface of each NPTv6 translator.  During periods of
   normal operation, interfaces that are assigned addresses from the
   lower half of the SAB receive traffic through Upstream Provider #1.

Internet-Draft            Multihoming With NPT6            December 2011


   Likewise, interfaces that are assigned addresses from the upper half
   of the SAB receive traffic through Upstream Provider #2.

   Selected interfaces, because they receive a great deal of traffic,
   must receive traffic through both upstream providers simultaneously.
   Furthermore, those interfaces must control the portion of traffic
   arriving through each upstream provider.  The site assigns multiple
   addresses to those interfaces, some from the lower half and others
   from the upper half of the SAB.  For any interface, the ratio of
   upper half to lower half assignments roughly controls the portion of
   traffic arriving through each upstream provider.  See Section 2.3,
   Section 2.5 and Section 2.7 for details.

2.3.  Address Translation

   Both NPTv6 translators are configured with the following rules:

         For outbound packets, if the first 60 bits of the source
         address identify the lower half of the SAB, overwrite those 60
         bits with the 60 bits that identify CNB #1

         For outbound packets, if the first 60 bits of the source
         address identify the upper half of the SAB, overwrite those 60
         bits with the 60 bits that identify CNB #2

         For outbound packets, if none of the conditions above are met,
         either drop or pass the packet without translation, according
         to local security policy

         For inbound packets, if the first 60 bits of the destination
         address identify CNB #1, overwrite those 60 bits with the 60
         bits that identify the lower half of the SAB

         For inbound packets, if the first 60 bits of the destination
         address identify CNB #2, overwrite those 60 bits with the 60
         bits that identify the upper half of the SAB

         For inbound packets, if none of the conditions above are met,
         either drop or pass the packet without translation, according
         to local security policy

   Due to the nature of the rules described above, NPTv6 translation is
   stateless.  Therefore, traffic flows do not need to be symmetric
   across NPTv6 translators.  Furthermore, a traffic flow can shift from
   one NPTv6 translator to another without causing transport-layer
   session failure.

2.4.  Domain Name System (DNS)

   In order to make all site resources reachable by domain name
   [RFC1034], the site publishes AAAA records [RFC3596] associating each
   resource with all of its CNB addresses.  While this DNS architecture
   is sufficient, it is suboptimal.  Traffic that both originates and
   terminates within the site traverses NPTv6 translators needlessly.
   Several optimizations are available.  These optimizations are well
   understood and have been applied to [RFC1918] networks for many
   years.

2.5.  Routing

   Upstream Provider #1 uses an Interior Gateway Protocol to flood
   topology information throughout its domain.  It also uses BGP
   [RFC4271] to distribute customer and peer reachability information.

   PE #1 acquires a route to CNB #1 with NEXT-HOP equal to the outside
   interface of NPTv6 #1.  PE #1 can either learn this route from a
   single-hop eBGP session with NPTv6 #1, or acquire it through static
   configuration.  In either case, PE #1 overwrites the NEXT-HOP of this
   route with its own loopback address and distributes the route
   throughout Upstream Provider #1 using iBGP.  The LOCAL PREF for this
   route is set high, so that the route will be preferred to alternative
   routes to CNB #1.  Upstream Provider #1 does not distribute this
   route to CNB #1 outside of its own borders because it is part of the
   larger aggregate PAB #1, which is itself advertised.

   NPTv6 #1 acquires a default route with NEXT-HOP equal to the directly
   connected interface on PE #1.  NPTv6 #1 can either learn this route
   from a single-hop eBGP session with PE #1, or acquire it through
   static configuration.

   Similarly, Backup PE #1 acquires a route to CNB #1 with NEXT-HOP
   equal to the outside interface of NPTv6 #2.  Backup PE #1 can either
   learn this route from a multi-hop eBGP session with NPTv6 #2, or
   acquire it through static configuration.  In either case, Backup PE
   #1 overwrites the NEXT-HOP of this route with its own loopback
   address and distributes the route throughout Upstream Provider #1
   using iBGP.  Distribution procedures are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-best-external].  The LOCAL PREF for this route is set
   low, so that the route will not be preferred to alternative routes to
   CNB #1.  Upstream Provider #1 does not distribute this route to CNB
   #1 outside of its own borders.

   Even if Backup PE #1 maintains an eBGP session NPTv6 #2, it does not
   advertise the default route through that eBGP session.  During
   failures, Backup PE #1 does not attract outbound traffic to itself.

Internet-Draft            Multihoming With NPT6            December 2011


   Finally, the Autonomous System Border Routers (ASBR) contained by
   Upstream Provider #1 maintain eBGP sessions with their peers.  The
   ASBRs advertise only PAB #1 through those eBGP sessions.  Upstream
   Provider #1 does not advertise any of the following to its eBGP
   peers:

         any prefix that is contained by PAB #1 (i.e., more specific)

         PAB #2 or any part thereof

         the SAB or any part thereof

   Upstream Provider #2 is configured in a manner analogous to that
   described above.

2.6.  Failure Detection and Recovery

   When PE #1 loses its route to CNB #1, it withdraws its iBGP
   advertisement for that prefix from Upstream Provider #1.  The route
   advertised by Backup PE #1 remains and Backup PE #1 attracts traffic
   bound for CNB #1 to itself.  Backup PE #1 forwards that traffic
   through the tunnel to NPTv6 #2.  NPTv6 #2 performs translations and
   delivers the traffic to the Internal Network.

   Likewise, when NPTv6 #1 loses its default route, it makes itself
   unavailable as a gateway for other hosts on the Internal Network.
   NPTv6 #2 attracts all outbound traffic to itself and forwards that
   traffic through Upstream Provider #2.  The mechanism by which NPTv6
   #1 makes itself unavailable as a gateway is beyond the scope of this
   document.

   If PE #1 maintains a single-hop eBGP session with NPTv6 #1, the
   failure of that eBGP session will cause both routes mentioned above
   to be lost.  Otherwise, another failure detection mechanism such as
   BFD [RFC5881] is required.

   Regardless of the failure detection mechanism, inbound traffic
   traverses the tunnel only during failure periods and outbound traffic
   never traverses the tunnel.  Furthermore, restoration is localized.
   As soon as the advertisement for CNB #1 is withdrawn throughout
   Upstream Provider #1, restoration is complete.

   Transport-layer connections survive Failure/Recovery events because
   both NPTv6 translators implement identical translation rules.  When a
   traffic flow shifts from one translator to another, neither the
   source address nor the destination address changes.

2.7.  Load Balancing

   In the architecture described above, site addressing determines load
   balancing.  If a host is numbered from the lower half of the SAB, its
   address is mapped to CNB #1, which is announced only by Upstream
   Provider #1 (as part of PAB #1).  Therefore, during periods of normal
   operation, all traffic bound for that host traverses Upstream
   Provider #1 and NPTv6 #1.  Likewise, if a host is numbered from the
   upper half of the SAB, its address is mapped to CNB #2, which is
   announced only by Upstream Provider #2 (as part of PAB #2).
   Therefore, during periods of normal operation, all traffic bound for
   that host traverses Upstream Provider #2 and NPTv6 #2.

   Hosts that receive a great quantity of traffic can be assigned
   multiple addresses, with some from the lower half and others from the
   upper half of the SAB.  The address chosen for any particular flow
   determines the path of inbound traffic for that flow.  For flows
   initiated outside of the Internal Network, the site influences the
   probability that a particular address will be used by manipulating
   the type and number of PAB addresses advertised in DNS.


3.  Discussion

   This section discusses the merits of the proposed architecture, as
   compared with other multihoming approaches [I-D.ietf-lisp]
   [I-D.rja-ilnp-intro].  The following are benefits of the proposed
   architecture:

         Address mapping information is required only at the NPTv6
         translator.  There is no need to distribute mapping information
         beyond the boundaries of the multihomed site.

         Because only a small number of mapping rules are required at
         each multihomed site, there is no need to cache these rules.

         During periods of normal operation, packets do not need to be
         encapsulated.  Inbound traffic traverses a tunnel only during
         failure periods and outbound traffic never traverses a tunnel.

         The proposal can be realized using a wide variety of existing
         encapsulation methods.  It does not require a new encapsulation
         method.

         The failover/restoration mechanism is localized to a single
         autonomous system.  Once updated routing information has been
         distributed throughout the autonomous system, the failover/
         restoration event is complete.

         Benefit can be derived from incremental, partial and even
         minimal deployment.

         The cost of the solution is born by its beneficiaries (i.e.,
         primarily the multihomed site and secondarily multihomed site's
         upstream provider).

   The following are disadvantages of the proposed architecture:

         By modifying IPv6 addresses, this architecture violates the
         end-to-end principle.

         The load balancing capabilities described in this memo may not
         suffice for all sites.  Those sites might be required to fall
         back upon other load balancing solutions (e.g., advertising
         multiple prefixes)

         The time required to redistribute traffic from one path to
         another is determined by DNS TTL


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions.


5.  Security Considerations

   As with any architecture that modifies source and destination
   addresses, the operation of access control lists, firewalls and
   intrusion detection systems may be impacted.  Also many users may
   confuse NPTv6 translation with a NAT.  Two limitations of NAT are
   that a) it does not support incoming connections without special
   configuration and b) it requires symmetric routing across the NAT
   device.  Many users understood these limitations to be security
   features.  Because NPTv6 has neither of these limitations, it also
   offers neither of these features.
