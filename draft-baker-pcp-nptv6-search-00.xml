    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This note uses terminology defined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pcp-base"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Section 5 of <xref target="RFC6296"></xref> points out that there can
      be issues when an application refers a session initiated by a peer to a
      third party application running on the same or a different system; it
      must identify the system the third party application is running on. This
      is often done by citing an IP address or a DNS name that maps to one or
      more IP addresses.</t>

      <t>In a network that uses Network Address Translation or Network Prefix
      Translation technology, referrals using IP addresses imply that the
      application must be able to identify both the Internal and External
      Addresses of the third party. Similarly, when a peer system queries DNS
      to find an address (either for the initial access or because a referral
      used a DNS name), DNS must supply it with an address appropriate to its
      domain. If the two are both in the same network, that would be the
      Internal Address, and otherwise all External Addresses.</t>

      <t>This note describes an approach to finding the External Addresses
      associated with an Internal Address.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="pcp-query" title="Using Multicast PCP">
      <t>Consider a scenario in which the firewall or other system
      implementing the NPTv6 Translator also implements a <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pcp-base">Port Control Protocol (PCP)</xref> Server,
      and that PCP Server joins a multicast group ALL-NPTv6-TRANSLATORS. A PCP
      Client could send PCP Requests to the multicast group, and get responses
      from every NPTv6 Translator in the domain.</t>

      <section title="PCP Client: Generating a Request">
        <t>The PCP client sends a MAP Request to that multicast group address,
        with Internal Port=0 and Protocol=0 (which means 'all ports for all
        protocols'). To accommodate packet loss, the request SHOULD be
        transmitted several times with a random jitter between them. It is
        RECOMMENDED to transmit the MAP Request a total of three times with
        the first retransmission after 5 seconds plus a random value between
        0-2.5 seconds, and again at 10 seconds plus a random value between 0-5
        seconds.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="PCP Server: Processing a Request">
        <t>The PCP server embedded in the NPTv6 device first verifies that the
        PCP message conforms to the requirements of a PCP MAP request as
        described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcp-base"></xref>. Then it checks
        that the MAP request field's Protocol and Internal Port are both zero;
        if not, a MALFORMED_REQUEST error is generated.</t>

        <t>If the MAP request contains the THIRD_PARTY option, it MUST contain
        an IPv6 address, otherwise it results in a MALFORMED_OPTION error.</t>

        <t>Then, depending on the IPv6 prefix of the PCP MAP request (or the
        IPv6 prefix of the THIRD_PARTY option, if present):</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>If no translation applies to that IPv6 address (i.e., the
            address is not within a prefix that is translated) the Assigned
            External Address of the MAP response is set to the same as the IP
            address from the IP header of the PCP request (unless THIRD_PARTY
            was used, in which case it is set to the IP address of the
            THIRD_PARTY option).</t>

            <t>If a translation would occur, the external address is returned
            in the Assigned External Address field.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>If the NPTv6 device itself is multihomed (i.e., it contains
        multiple NPTv6 translation functions), a separate MAP Response is sent
        for each NPTv6 instance -- as if they were separate devices. These MAY
        be sent from the same unicast source address.</t>

        <t>It is RECOMMENDED that the Assigned Lifetime of the MAP response be
        the remaining lifetime of the ISP-assigned address. In this way, PCP
        clients receive timely updates to the IPv6 address assigned by the
        ISP.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="PCP Client: Processing Responses">
        <t>Each MAP request sent to the multicast group will result in zero,
        one, or more responses (from each NPTv6 listening to that multicast
        group).</t>

        <t>If the network contains multiple NPTv6 instances, multiple MAP
        responses will normally be received. If multiple responses are
        received, the shortest PCP Assigned Lifetime should be used when
        sending renewal multicast PCP requests.</t>

        <t>Renewals should follow the procedure described in Section 10.2.1 of
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-pcp-base"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="recovery" title="Recovery">
        <t>An NPTv6 device may join or leave a network unexpectedly (e.g.,
        device failure, link failure, or link recovery). To accommodate these
        situations, the NPTv6 devices SHOULD implement PCP Rapid Recovery, as
        described in Section 13 of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-pcp-base"></xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="dns" title="An implementation approach">
      <t>A practical implementation of the PCP client in this case would be in
      a <xref target="RFC1034">DNS Server</xref><xref
      target="RFC1035"></xref>. Whenever it learns of a mapping between a name
      and an Internal Address (which might happen only at startup in a static
      system, or might happen frequently if <xref target="RFC2136">Dynamic
      DNS</xref><xref target="RFC3007"></xref> is used with <xref
      target="RFC4941">IPv6 Privacy Addresses</xref>), the DNS Server queries
      ALL-NPTv6-TRANSLATORS for the list of relevant addresses to create AAAA
      Resource Records for. It may get no response (although if there are no
      such translators one would hope for an ICMP Host Unreachable response
      rather than letting it time out), one response, or many. It always makes
      a Resource Record for the Internal Address; it also makes Resource
      Records for any External Addresses reported. Such translations come with
      lifetimes; the DNS Server is responsible to re-request as lifetimes
      expire, and to not grant longer Resource Record lifetimes than it has
      address lifetimes.</t>

      <t>Any system needing to know its own External Addresses or those of
      another party could then obtain them by resolving the relevant DNS name,
      or could follow the same process.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This note requests of the IANA the assignment of a set of multicast
      addresses as described in Section 2.7 of the <xref target="RFC4291">IP
      Version 6 Addressing Architecture</xref> from the registry <xref
      target="v6mult"></xref>. This set of addresses is referred to as
      "ALL-NPTv6-TRANSLATORS". One address should be assigned for each of the
      following scopes: Link-Local, Admin-Local, Site-Local, and
      Organization-Local.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Operational Considerations">
      <t>This document defines a set of multicast addresses in several scopes.
      Operationally, the choice of which scope is appropriate is made by the
      administration. A reasonable default value in system configurations
      might be Organization-Local (e.g., all NPTv6 Translators operated by the
      organization). However, a large organization might well choose
      Site-Local or Admin-Local, and consider that "site" or "administrative"
      domain to include the set of NPTv6 Translators advertising a default
      route into a specific part of its network.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The principal security threat in this algorithm is a security threat
      inherent to IP multicast routing and any application that runs on it. A
      rogue system can join a multicast group, meaning it that it sees traffic
      sent to the multicast group that it was presumably not intended to see,
      and may originate responses that are not correct or infer information.
      Such a rogue system also in effect pulls traffic toward it, which may
      not have been planned for in capacity planning. In this scenario, the
      rogue system has the opportunity to learn the addresses of every system
      that has such a translation, and has the capability of adding an
      incorrect External Address to any list of External Addresses. This
      presents both privacy and security issues.</t>

      <t>The obvious mitigation is authentication and authorization of
      responses returned; requesters should verify that responses are coming
      from systems that the administration thinks are legitimately NPTv6
      Translators. PCP does not define an authentication model, and does not
      define the use of TLS/DTLS or others. Hence, this likely implies the use
      of IPSec, or at least a list of the addresses of authorized NPTv6
      translators in the network, with administration-specific responses to
      rogue equipment such as ignoring such responses or some form of
      remediation. If the multicast routing technology supports it, refusing
      such rogue "joins" would be a good idea.</t>

      <t>In addition, the security considerations in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-pcp-base"></xref> also apply to this use.</t>
