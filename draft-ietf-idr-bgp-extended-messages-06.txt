                    Extended Message support for BGP
                draft-ietf-idr-bgp-extended-messages-06

Abstract

   The BGP specification mandates a maximum BGP message size of 4096
   octets.  As BGP is extended to support newer AFI/SAFIs, there is a
   need to extend the maximum message size beyond 4096 octets.  This
   document updates [RFC4271] by providing an extension to BGP to extend
   its current message size from 4096 octets to 65535 octets.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to
   be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] only when they
   appear in all upper case.  They may also appear in lower or mixed
   case as English words, without normative meaning.

   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

1.  Introduction

   The BGP specification [RFC4271] mandates a maximum BGP message size
   of 4096 octets.  As BGP is extended to support newer AFI/SAFIs and
   newer capabilities (e.g., [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-overview]), there is
   a need to extend the maximum message size beyond 4096 octets.  This
   draft provides an extension to BGP to extend its current message size
   limit from 4096 octets to 65535 octets.

2.  BGP Extended Message

   A BGP message over 4096 octets in length is a BGP Extended Message.

   BGP Extended Messages have maximum message size of 65535 octets.  The
   smallest message that may be sent consists of a BGP header without a
   data portion (19 octets).

   Multi-octet fields MUST be in network byte order.

3.  Extended message Capability for BGP

   To advertise the BGP Extended Message Capability to a peer, a BGP
   speaker uses BGP Capabilities Advertisement [RFC5492].  By
   advertising the BGP Extended Message Capability to a peer, a BGP
   speaker conveys that it is able to send, receive, and properly handle
   BGP Extended Messages.

   A peer which does not advertise this capability MUST NOT send BGP
   Extended Messages, and BGP Extended Messages MUST NOT be sent to it.

   The BGP Extended Message Capability is a new BGP Capability [RFC5492]
   defined with Capability code TBD and Capability length 0.

4.  Operation

   A BGP speaker that is willing to send and receive BGP Extended
   Messages from its peer should advertise the BGP Extended Message
   Capability to its peer using BGP Capabilities Advertisement
   [RFC5492].  A BGP speaker may send extended messages to its peer only
   if it has received the Extended Message Capability from its peer.

   Applications generating messages which might be encapsulated within
   BGP messages MUST limit the size of their payload to take into
   account the maximum message size and all encapsulation overheads on
   the path the encapsulated data are expected to traverse.

5.  Acknowledgements

   The authors thank John Scudder, John Levine, and Job Snijders for
   their input.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to register a new BGP Capability Code in the
   upper range named BGP Extended Message Capability referring to this
   document.

7.  Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change BGP's underlying security
   issues.
