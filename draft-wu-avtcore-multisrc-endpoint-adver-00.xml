      <t>When two endpoints with multiple media sources are in communication,
      each media source or each receiver within either endpoint may send or
      receive reception report independently. This may incur a lot of
      duplicated reception report to and from the endpoint with multiple
      sources. This document discusses how to tackle these problems and
      propose three phases for suppressing reception reports.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>For some applications that use unicast transport, e.g., in RTCWeb
      application, an endpoint with multiple media sources
      (i.e.,multiple-source hosts, e.g., a client with several cameras) may
      use a different SSRC for each medium but sending them in the same RTP
      session, which reduces communication failure due to NAT and firewall
      when using multiple RTP sessions or transport flows.</t>

      <t>However when two endpoints with multiple media sources are in
      communication, each media source within either endpoint may send
      reception report independently and the receiving endpoint may not know
      the reception reports received from different media source are from the
      same sending endpoint. This creates the following three problems:<list
          style="symbols">
          <t>An endpoint with multiple media sources involved in one RTP
          session may send the reception report with duplicated information
          about the same remote media source from each of local media
          sources.</t>

          <t>An endpoint with multiple media sources involved in one RTP
          session may receive the reception report with duplicated information
          about the same local media source from each of remote media
          sources.</t>

          <t>An endpoint with multiple media sources involved in one RTP
          session also may send reception reports about one of its own media
          sources from another of its own (This is also referred to as RTCP
          self-reporting). Such reception reports cause additional traffic
          travelling over the link between sending endpoints and receiving
          endpoint, which may cause network congestion issue and affect the
          media qualities.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This document discusses how to tackle these problems. Three phases
      for suppressing reception reports are proposed.<list style="symbols">
          <t>Grouping of media sources originate from a single endpoint and
          classifying these media sources into multiple groups.</t>

    <section title="Protocol Overview">
      <t>In order to suppress unnecessary reception reports to and from
      multi-source endpoint, multi-source endpoint should group media sources
      originating from a single endpoint and elect one or a set of specified
      SSRCs for reception report processing (e.g., reception report sending,
      reception report receiving and reception report monitoring).</t>

      <section title="Report Source Grouping">
        <t>When an endpoint with multiple sources multiplexes multiple media
        types in the same RTP session, the media source originating from the
        same endpoint should be grouped together. Similarly the endpoint with
        multiple sources may have multiple one or more than one report source
        for monitoring. These report sources for monitoring should also be
        grouped together. Therefore an endpoint with multiple sources should
        at least split all its own media sources or receivers into two
        groups(i.e., split SSRCs into two groups): One is sending group, the
        other is monitoring group. Each group may have one or several group
        members. Each group member is identified by a different SSRC.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Report Source Election">
        <t>When grouping for each endpoint with multiple sources is available,
        in order to prevent group members receiving duplicated data, one or
        more than one group member MUST be elected from sending group as
        report source for reception report sending. When one report source
        leaves the session or is down, another candidate report source can
        replace instead. If the monitoring is used, each endpoint with
        multiple sources MUST have at least one report source for monitoring
        purpose. One or more than one reporting sources MUST be selected from
        monitoring group for monitoring use.</t>

        <t>Each endpoint with multiple sources at least has one SSRC for
        reception report sending. If the monitoring is used, the endpoint with
        multiple sources should choose another SSRC from monitoring group as
        monitoring report source.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Report Source Advertisement">
        <t>When report sources are elected for reception report sending, and
        monitoring purpose respectively, it is necessary to signal which
        report source is used for which purpose.</t>

        <t>One way is to define three new SDES items to advertise the
        reporting sources from endpoint with multiple sources that are used
        for reception report sending, receiving and monitoring respectively
        (See section 5.1 and section 5.2 for protocol format details).</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Consideration for Session member numbers updating">
      <t>As described in section 6.2.1 of RFC3550, Calculation of the RTCP
      packet interval mainly depends upon the number of members. For an
      endpoint with multiple sources in communication with another endpoint
      with multiple sources, it is more desirable to set the number of sender
      for such endpoint as one and the number of receiver as one. However
      according to RFC3550, each source within such endpoint is considered
      valid until multiple packets carrying the new SSRC have been received,
      or until an SDES RTCP packet containing a CNAME for that SSRC has been
      received. In order to invalid the source that are not elected as report
      source, it is necessary to define new SDES item to indicate other
      sources that are not chosen as report sources(See section 5.4 for more
      details). Also we can define an RTP header extension [RFC5285] to
      indicate the other sources that are not chosen as report sources(See
      section 5.4 for more details).This extension can be sent by the endpoint
      with multiple sources either at the beginning of the RTP session or in
      the middle of the RTP session. Another way is to use RTCP NACK packet
      [RFC4585] to suppress the unnecessary reception report from an endpoint
      with multiple sources. The NACK can be sent by the endpoint with
      multiple source when the endpoint with multiple sources is aware of
      reception report duplication.</t>
