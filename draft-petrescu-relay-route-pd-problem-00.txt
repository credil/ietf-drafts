         Route Problem at Relay during DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation
              draft-petrescu-relay-route-pd-problem-00.txt

Abstract

   The operation of a prefix delegation procedure with the DHCPv6
   protocol may need route setup and maintenance at the Delegating
   Router, Requesting Router and on the entity on which the Relay agent
   is implemented.  This document describes the problem of routing
   during DHCPv6 prefix delegation, and is illustrated by ADSL-type and
   cellular-type of topologies which may use Relays; we refer to section
   14 of RFC 3633 which mentions the need of 'a protocol or other out of
   band communication to add routing information for delegated
   prefixes'.  Based on this problem, a number of requirements from the
   service providers are described.

   A small set of documented solutions are separately mentioned
   (snooping, route injection, etc.), together with their pros and cons
   according to a particular judgment.

Internet-Draft   DHCPv6 Route Problem at Relay during PD    October 2013


1.  Introduction

   The operation of a prefix delegation procedure with the DHCPv6
   protocol may need route setup and maintenance at the Delegating
   Router, Requesting Router and on the entity on which the Relay agent
   is implemented.  This document describes the problem of routing
   during DHCPv6 prefix delegation, and is illustrated by ADSL-type and
   cellular-type of topologies which may use Relays; we refer to section
   14 of RFC 3633 which mentions the need of 'a protocol or other out of
   band communication to add routing information for delegated
   prefixes'.  Based on this problem, a number of requirements from the
   service providers are described.

   A small set of documented solutions are separately mentioned
   (snooping, route injection, etc.), together with their pros and cons
   according to a particular judgment.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   PE router stands for 'Provider Edge' router.  It is a router in the
   provider's network, situated at its edge.  It is connected directly
   to the CE router ('Customer's Edge') which is situated within the
   customer's network, at its edge.


3.  Problem and the Related Topologies

3.1.  Problem

   This is a problem mentioned in the context of the specification of
   the Relay Agent behaviour, in DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation [RFC3633].  If
   the network topology in which running Prefix Delegation is run
   involves a Relay Agent, then the delegating router may need a
   protocol or other out-of-band communication to add routing
   information for delegated prefixes into any router through which the
   requesting router may forward traffic.  That protocol or out-of-band
   communication are left unspecified.

   A more detailed interpretation of that problem is described next.

   Intuitively, the Prefix Delegation operation consists in a request
   and a delegation phase (more precisely, a prefix allocation is
   performed by the software in the Server, and messages such as

   Solicit/Advertise/Request/Reply are used, see [RFC3315]).  In the
   request phase, the Requesting Router requests an IPv6 prefix (not
   just an IPv6 address).  In the delegation phase, the Delegating
   Router allocates (reserves) a prefix for use by the Requesting
   Router; this prefix is then sent by the Delegating Router to the
   Requesting Router.

   Allocating a prefix is an operation different than allocating simply
   an address.  In IPv6, one of the differences relates to the way in
   which the routing is set up with respect to the allocated parameter.
   The routing for the allocated address is pre-set ((1) the address is
   part of a prefix, and the routing is pre-set for that prefix and (2)
   the address is allocated by the Server and may be resolved on-link);
   whereas the routing for a prefix can not be pre-set ((1) it is next
   to impossible to pre-aggregate several /64 allocated prefixes into a
   single pre-set /64 prefix and (2) the IP address of the next-hop is
   not known at the Server during the prefix allocation phase, being
   pre-configured on the Client, and not relayed in the messages sent by
   the Relay; yet this address is needed for route setup).  The concepts
   of numbered and unnumbered interface may also play a distinctive
   role.

   An alternative explanation: in the case of allocating an address, the
   routing is pre-set for one particular prefix, during network setup
   operation.  Due to the imposed length of the Interface ID on the
   widely used Ethernet-type of links, that pre-set prefix has length
   64.  That particular prefix covers the entire set of addresses which
   may be dynamically allocated by DHCP.  On the contrary, dynamically
   allocating a prefix does not benefit of this pre-setting of routing,
   because of that 64 limit.  One can not pre-set a prefix of length 64
   which covers other prefixes of same length /64.  There is thus a need
   to dynamically set a route for the allocated prefix (because it is
   not possible to pre-set routes for allocated prefixes).

3.2.  Relay vs. non-Relay Topologies

   In practice, some topologies may accommodate easily the deployment of
   Prefix Delegation, yet other topologies may pose problems with
   respect to PD.  A topology where the Requesting Router is a neighbor
   to the Delegating Router, and the Requesting Router's default route
   is the Delegating Router, may easily accommodate the Prefix
   Delegation operation (in this case too, the delegating router needs
   the operation of route set-up for network reachability).  This
   topology is pictured below.

Internet-Draft   DHCPv6 Route Problem at Relay during PD    October 2013


   The operation of Prefix Delegation in the topology illustrated above
   needs to provoke the setting up of a route at the DHCP Relay during
   the Prefix Delegation operation.  Otherwise, the DHCP Relay will not
   be able to forward packets addressed to Host PC (which is configured
   with an address in the range of the allocated prefix).

   This problem statement if related exclusively to the operation of the
   Relay Agent and the computer (Router or Host) on which this Agent
   runs.  These entities are direct neighbors (in the sense of the
   Neighbor Discovery protocol) with the interface on which the
   Requesting Router emits the DHCPv6 Request message.  On another hand,
   a similar problem, is considered in a more generic manner: upon
   delegation, use a routing protocol to maintain routing state at
   Delegating Routers, at other intermediary routers (for routers not
   necessarily direct neighbors to the RR), and at the Requesting
   Router; this is described in section 2.3.4 of
   [I-D.stenberg-pd-route-maintenance].

3.3.  Relay Topologies for Large-scale Deployments

   The Figure 1 in [RFC3633] illustrates a network architecture in which
   prefix delegation could be used.  That architecture is relating
   directly to the use of DSL deployments.

   The following topologies pertinent for large-scale deployments are
   considered.  A topology for home deployments, and a topology of
   mobile hotspots (tethering smartphone) are pictured.

4.  Issues and Requirements

   As a reminder, the main requirement from service providers is the
   following:

   o  Need for deterministic and dynamic means to drive route aggregates
      and associated route announcement actions to be undertaken by PE
      routers while ensuring a consistency with prefix assignment
      states.  In particular:

      *  Optimizing the size of routing and forwarding tables must be
         supported.  As such, route aggregation must be supported by

         these routers.

      *  Failures to deliver incoming packets to a customer serviced
         behind a given PE router must be avoided.  Dedicated routing
         actions must be achieved to ensure incoming traffic will be
         forwarded to the appropriate customer's device.  Nevertheless,
         triggers to drive the level of route aggregation and required
         route announcement actions must be supported.

      *  Prefix assignments and routing actions must be correlated
         otherwise delivery of connectivity service will fail.

   These requirements can be fulfilled by a variety of solutions that
   have their limits.  For instance:

   o  Current practices rely on static configuration.  This practice is
      prone to errors.

   o  The level of route aggregation cannot be driven by PE routers
      without any hint(s) from an entity that has the visibility on
      aggregation policies and the status of prefixes, etc.

   o  Relying on proprietary means to trigger the injection of routing
      entries may lead to undesired behavior: increase the size of
      routing table and forwarding table due to injecting very specific
      routes, etc.

   Note:

   o  Prefix assignment policies can be configured to DHCP servers
      including topological aware considerations (e.g., regional-based
      assignment, per-service assignment, etc.).  Refer to Section 4 of
      [I-D.lemon-dhc-topo-conf].

   o  Status of active (prefix) states is maintained by DHCP servers.

   o  The use of DHCP for this purpose does not require an additional
      interface to pass the state maintained by the DHCP server to a
      routing controller which will then undertake appropriate actions.

   Finally, it is worth mentioning that other standards development
   organizations consider the use of DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation in
   particular contexts:

   o  at the Broadband Forum ('BBF'), a technical report titled "IPv6 in
      the context of TR-101", dated November 2010, [bf], lists a number
      of requirements derived from the problem that "hosts receiving
      IPv6 addresses from the RR are not known to the BNG, i.e. the BNG

      is not aware of what addresses/prefixes are assigned to hosts
      attached to the RG acting as RR."

   o  at 3GPP, the specification [3gpp-ref] describes the use of DHCPv6
      prefix delegation using S2c.  It is for a "User Equipment acting
      as a Mobile Router".


5.  Potential Solutions, Solution Space

5.1.  DHCPv6 message snooping for PD-prefix

   The Provider Edge (PE) router acting as relay snoops every reply
   message from the server with valid lease.  Per the parameters, such
   as valid-lifetime and preferred-lifetime, shown the IA_PD option, PE
   router knows the lease of each delegated prefix.  Then the PE can add
   and withdraw the associated route per the lease of each delegated
   prefix.

   Pros: no new messages and options defined, no additional function on
   the relay.

   Cons: but PE router need to snoop each DHCPv6-PD message, then take
   action for routing per the lease of each delegated prefix.

   In the real deployed network, PE router always need to handle each
   protocol message in the control plane including DHCPv6 message.  That
   makes snooping sounds not a problem for PE router.  Almost every
   implementation of PE router today in the Telecom's network adopts the
   method of snooping to get the lease of each delegated prefix.

5.2.  ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-agentopt-delegate for PD-prefix

   [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-agentopt-delegate].

   The relay use OPTION_ORO to request the assigned address or the
   delegated prefixes for the client from the server.  But the draft has
   not mentioned in which DHCPv6 message the OPTION_ORO will always be
   employed.

   Pros: no new messages, just define a new RAAN option
   (OPTION_AGENT_NOTIFY) to convey OPTION_IAADDR and OPTION_IAPREFIX,
   sounds it can de-couple with the DHCPv6-PD mechanism.

   Cons: sounds only for the route @ relay (or PE router) co-related
   with the delegated prefix, have no route aggregation.

   Due to PE router need to interpret and handle each protocol message

Internet-Draft   DHCPv6 Route Problem at Relay during PD    October 2013


   in the control plane, it can get the assigned address or the
   delegated prefixes directly from the DHCPv6 message.  That makes RAAN
   option unnecessary.

5.3.  draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-prefix-pool-opt-03 for prefix pool of PD

   [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-prefix-pool-opt].

   PE router acting as relay use OPTION_ORO in the relay-forward of
   DHCPv6-PD message to request the information about the prefix pool
   (and its status).  After the PE got the OPTION_PREFIX_POOL in the
   Relay-reply message, it can add the aggregation route per the status
   (or lease) of the prefix pool.  The aggregation route can
   dramatically reduce the size of the routing table in the ISP network.

   Pros: no new messages, just define a new option (OPTION_PREFIX_POOL)
   to convey the information about prefix pools.

   Cons: lightweight but piggyback on the UDP-based DHCPv6 message.

   This draft hasn't achieve Consensus yet, but may need to simplify the
   mechanism to gain more support.

5.4.  draft-joshi-dhc-dhcpv6-aggr-route-opt for aggregation route of PD

   [I-D.joshi-dhc-dhcpv6-aggr-route-opt]

   PE router acting as relay tries to employ new messages exchange
   between relay and server, including new function of information-
   request, renew and reply, reconfigure.  That make the communication
   between the relay and server to be the communication between hosts.

   Pros: de-coupled from the DHCPv6-PD mechanism, communication between
   hosts could employ the reliable TCP.

   Cons: introduce new functionality defined for the relay and server,
   define new messages and option (OPTION_AGGR_ROUTE), have problem of
   synchronization for the status of aggregation route or for the leases
   of delegated prefixes.

   This draft may be incomplete work, maybe further discussion may be
   needed.

Internet-Draft   DHCPv6 Route Problem at Relay during PD    October 2013


Appendix E.  ICMP Redirect

   One possible solution to inform an entity in the network about a
   better route to a destination is to use the message ICMPv6 Redirect,
   as specified in [RFC4861].  This message is used by Routers to inform
   hosts about better routes.

   Some DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation deployments consider that the DHCPv6
   Relay functionality is co-located within a Router.  In this case, it
   is not possible to use the ICMP Redirect message.

   However, in other possible deployments, the DHCPv6 Relay
   functionality is co-located in a Host; in this case the use of ICMPv6
   Redirect may be possible.  An example topology of this use of DHCP
   Relay on a Host is depicted in the following figure:
