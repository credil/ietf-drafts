Abstract

   The ALTO Service allows applications to obtain network information
   for optimizing their traffic.  An ALTO server maintains ALTO data and
   provides ALTO services to its clients.  In a big network, a single
   ALTO server could a bottleneck in performance.  To increase the
   scalability of ALTO, this document proposes a hierarchical
   architecture for ALTO.  This architecture allows collecting ALTO
   information and/or providing ALTO services in a distributed manner.
   An ISP can deploy multiple ALTO servers in a hierarchical
   architecture to improve scalability.

1.  Introduction

   The ALTO Service allows applications to obtain network information
   for optimizing their traffic.  The ALTO protocol
   [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol] defines communications between an ALTO
   client and an ALTO server.  An ALTO server need to maintain ALTO
   information and provides ALTO services to its clients.  In a big
   network, a single ALTO could a bottleneck in performance.  Therefore,
   [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol] proposes some mechanisms to improve
   scalability including HTTP caching, application redistributing ALTO
   inforamtion and deploying multiple ALTO servers.
   [I-D.picconi-alto-home-proxy] discusses the use of ALTO proxies
   running on home devices to improve scalabity, as well as reduce ALTO
   traffic and query latency.  [I-D.gu-alto-redistribution] discusses
   P2P applications redistributing ALTO inforamtion.

   To increase the scalability of ALTO, this document proposes a
   hierarchical architecture for ALTO.  This architecture allows
   collecting ALTO information and/or providing ALTO services in a
   distributed manner.  An ISP can deploy multiple ALTO servers in a
   hierarchical architecture to improve scalability.  Compared with the
   mechanism discussed in [I-D.gu-alto-redistribution], this mechanism
   dosn't require the help from users or applications.  This mechanism
   considers not only the load of providing ALTO services, but also the
   load of collecting and generating ALTO inforamtion.  The same as
   [I-D.dulinski-alto-inter-alto-protocol], this document invovles the
   interface between ALTO servers.  But
   [I-D.dulinski-alto-inter-alto-protocol] and this document focus on
   different scenarios, and address different issues.
   [I-D.dulinski-alto-inter-alto-protocol] focuses on the relation
   between ALTO servers from different ASes, while this document focuses
   on the ALTO servers inside an ISP.
   [I-D.dulinski-alto-inter-alto-protocol] addresses the issues about
   inter-AS ALTO information exchange as dicussed in
   [I-D.dulinski-alto-inter-problem-statement].

   As shown in the figure above, there are two tiers of ALTO servers in
   the hierarchical ALTO architecture.  There are multiple ALTO servers
   in the bottom tier, while there is only one ALTO server in the top
   tier.  ALTO servers in the bottom tier can collect maps and/or
   provide ALTO services collectively.  Three usages for the
   hierarchical ALTO architecture are described as below.

3.1.  ALTO Data Collection Usage

   In this usage, ALTO data are collected and generated in a distributed
   manner, while ALTO services are provided to ALTO clients in a
   centralized manner.  Each bottom ALTO server, i.e.  ALTO server in
   the bottom tier, is responsible for collecting some topology data and
   generating a part of the ALTO maps.  All bottom servers together send
   all parts of the ALTO maps to the top ALTO server, i.e. the ALTO
   server in the top tier.  Only the top ALTO server has the whole ALTO
   maps, and only the top ALTO server provides ALTO services to ALTO
   clients.  Bottom ALTO servers only provide services to the top ALTO
   server.  Bottom ALTO servers could be dedicated servers or coupled
   with routers.

3.2.  ALTO Map Distribution Usage

   In this usage, ALTO data are generated in a centralized manner, while
   ALTO services are provided to ALTO clients in a distributed manner.
   The top ALTO server is responsible for collecting all topology data
   and generating the ALTO maps.  The top ALTO server distributes the
   ALTO maps to all bottom ALTO servers.  Both the top ALTO server and
   the bottom ALTO servers have the ALTO maps.  All ALTO servers or only
   the bottom ALTO servers provide ALTO services to ALTO clients.

3.3.  ALTO Data Reflection Usage

   In this usage, ALTO data are generated in a distributed manner, and
   ALTO services are provided to ALTO clients also in a distributed
   manner.  Each bottom ALTO server is responsible for collecting some
   topology data and generating a part of the ALTO maps.  All bottom
   ALTO servers together send all parts of the ALTO maps to the top ALTO
   server.  Then the top ALTO server distributes the whole ALTO maps to
   all bottom servers.  All ALTO servers have the whole ALTO maps.  All
   ALTO servers or only the bottom ALTO servers provide ALTO services to
   ALTO clients.  When receiving ALTO map update from a bottom ALTO
   server, the top ALTO server sends update data to the other bottom
   ALTO servers like a reflector of ALTO data.
