Abstract

   This document specifies the control plane procedures to support
   Traffic Engineering (TE) across TRILL sites where such sites are
   interconnected using [1] with the help of a Layer 3 core running
   IP+GRE or IP+MPLS.  Traffic Engineering permits usage of a set of
   links that possess a certain characteristic like specified bandwidth,
   cost or even MTU. This draft aims at addressing how unicast frames
   travelling from one TRILL site to another across a Layer 3 core that
   supports IP+GRE and/or IP+MPLS can make use of the TE calculated
   paths in the sending site as well as the receiving site where such TE
   paths are pre-computed in both sites and need a mechanism to inter-
   link them together.

INTERNET DRAFT  Interconnecting TRILL sites deploying TE      March 2012


1  Introduction

   This document specifies the control plane procedures to support
   Traffic Engineering (TE) across TRILL sites where such sites are
   interconnected using [1] with the help of a Layer 3 core running
   IP+GRE or IP+MPLS.  Traffic Engineering permits usage of a set of
   links that possess a certain characteristic like specified bandwidth,
   cost or even MTU. This draft aims at addressing how unicast frames
   travelling from one TRILL site to another across a Layer 3 core that
   supports IP+GRE and/or IP+MPLS can make use of the TE calculated
   paths in the sending site as well as the receiving site where such TE
   paths are pre-computed in both sites and need a mechanism to inter-
   link them together. 

   This draft merely enables the above through a Area number aliasing
   mechanism. The mechanism to interconnect multiple TRILL sites and
   also which provides multi-tenancy in the sense that multiple
   customers of a Layer 3 core can make use of this proposal, is enabled
   by [1]. 


1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2. Methodology



   Assume the following topology consisting of two sites belonging to
   the same customer that are interconnected by a Layer 3 core network
   running IP+GRE and/or IP+MPLS as defined in [1]. The two sites are
   considered as IS-IS Level 1 areas having their own set of nicknames
   which may be non-unique between the two sites. That is the same
   nickname could be used in one site and the other or even a third or
   more if the need arises. The sites are connected using the N-PEs
   which are the border Rbridges that have one interface in the IS-IS
   Level 1 area and another Pseudo-interface in the Level 2 area which
   is actually Pseudo-Level-2 which in fact is the Layer 3 core
   interconnecting the two.

   Legend :

   U-PE : User-near PE device. U-PEs are edge devices in the Customer
   site or tier-2 site. This is a Rbridge with BGP capabilities. It has
   VRF instances for each tenant it is connected to in the case of
   Provider-Backbone functionality use-case.

   U-Ps : core devices in the Customer site that do not directly
   interact with the Customer's Customer.

   N-PE : Network Transport PE device. This is a device with RBridge
   capabilities in the non-core facing side. On the core facing side it
   is a Layer 3 device supporting IP+GRE and/or IP+MPLS. On the non-core
   facing side it has support for VRFs one for each TRILL site that it
   connects to. It runs BGP to convey the BGP-MAC-VPN VRF routes to its
   peer N-PEs. It also supports IGP on the core facing side like OSPF or
   IS-IS for Layer 3 and supports IP+GRE and/or IP+MPLS if need be.  A
   pseudo-interface representing the N-PE's connection to the Pseudo
   Level 2 area is provided at each N-PE and a forwarding adjacency is
   maintained between the near-end N-PE to its remote participating N-
   PEs pseudo-interface in the common Pseudo Level 2 area.

   N-P  : Network Transport core device. This device is IP and/or
   IP+MPLS core device that is part of the ISP / ISPs that provide the
   transport network that connect the disparate TRILL networks together.

   As defined in [3] these separate sites are assigned unique area
   numbers so that the sites can be connected using multi-level IS-IS
   like configuration as specified in [1].

   Here the MAC-routes and their corresponding Area number nicknames are
   placed in VRFs and using the BGP-MAC-VPN vrf methodology the sites
   are interconnected using BGP. BGP serves as the protocol that
   distributes the MAC-routes from one site to another. Specific Route
   Distinguishers (which are a capability of BGP based IP or MPLS VPNs)
   are used to assign uniqueness to the MAC-routes from amongst the
   sites. Route targets are used to export and import these routes in

   and out of the N-PEs that interconnect these TRILL sites.

   Here we advocate the use of a range Area number nicknames to be
   assigned to each site of a customer. Each Area number other than the
   default Area number which is used for non-TE based frames (both
   unicast and multicast), is assigned a significance for a specific
   pre-computed TE path within each site. We will call these Area
   numbers (other than the default Area number assigned for non-TE
   frames) as Site-TE-nicknames. These Site-TE-nicknames are distinct
   and unique for the set of customer sites interconnected by the Layer
   3 core.j

   Each of these Site-TE-nicknames represent a path computed on the
   basis of say a bandwidth, cost or MTU constraint. One could compute a
   path based on bandwidth that indicates that all the links in that TE-
   Path (represented by the Site-TE-nickname in that site) can carry
   traffic upto 10GB worth of traffic. Or the TE-Path computed may be
   based on cost indicating say that all the links in the TE-path have a
   cost over a threshold "X". Or the TE-path could be based on the fact
   that all the links in that path have a MTU over and above a threshold
   "M" or equal to "M". Combined constraints can also be used where
   bandwidth and MTU are to be considered.

   So we assign specific Path Characteristics to a TE-Path and assign a
   Site-TE-nickname to it. Also the TE-nicknames for each TE-Path are
   assigned on each Rbridge and percolated / flooded within that site.
   The Site-TE-nicknames are then carried with Path Characteristic TLVs
   (to be defined for this purpose) through IS-IS in the site and
   advertised into BGP at the N-PE connecting the site to the Layer 3
   core. The N-PE then uses a MP-BGP session to advertise these Site-TE-
   nicknames and the Path Characteristics in suitable format to other N-
   PEs across the Layer 3 core. 

   On the receiving N-PE the information is re-distributed into IS-IS
   TLVs and the Site-TE-nicknames reach all the Rbridges within the
   receiving site.

   The reachability information in a Rbridge within the TE-Path based
   unicast frame sending site would be that the destination exists in
   another site whose Site-TE-nickname is reachable through the near end
   N-PE. A TE-Path within the local / sending site would have been
   computed based on bandwidth , cost or MTU or combination of these
   would have been constructed to the N-PE if such links possessing the
   characteristics exist.

   Now an Ingress Rbridge can use its local Site-TE-nickname (for that
   TE-Path to the N-PE) if such a TE-Path the meets the constraints is
   available, as a Egress Nickname in the TRILL header to get a frame to

   flow through its site through the locally available TE-Path and reach
   the connected N-PE within the site. At the N-PE the TRILL header is
   decapsulated and the Egress Nickname of the incoming frame looked up
   for equivalent path characteristics in the set of Site-TE-nicknames
   of the site where the MAC-route says the target host exists. If a
   match occurs then the local N-PE puts in the suitable Egress Nickname
   as that Site-TE-nickname and sends the packet with the TRILL header
   across to the remote site. 

   At the receiving site the Egress Rbridge Nickname in the TRILL header
   is inspected and the appropriate TE-Path from the receiving N-PE
   (remote site N-PE) to the Egress Rbridge terminating the TE-Path
   represented by the Site-TE-nickname is used to carry the unicast
   frame to its destination.

   If no match exists for the path characteristics then the
   decapsulation still takes place and the normal discarding of the
   TRILL header over the L3 core as specified in [1] is done and the
   frame sent across to the other side. At the receiving end one of the
   existing normal paths (other than the TE-Paths) is used to get the
   packet to the target host.

   If the sending site does not have a TE-Path to its local N-PE that
   meets the constraints then it would choose to send the unicast frame
   through normal means as in [1].

   In the figure below we demonstrate how the data path is taken from
   sender to receiver assuming the sender is in one site and receiver in
   other.

   In the following picture, RB2 and RB3 are area border RBridges.  A
   source S is attached to RB1.  The two areas have nicknames 15961 and
   15918, respectively.  RB1 has a nickname, say 27, and RB4 has a
   nickname, say 44 (and in fact, they could even have the same
   nickname, since the RBridge nickname will not be visible outside the
   area).

   Here RB2 and RB3 are N-PEs. RB4 and RB1 are U-PEs.

   This sample topology could apply to Campus and data-center
   topologies. For Provider Backbone topologies S would fall outside the
   Area 15961 and RB1 would be the U-PE carrying the C-VLANs inside a P-
   VLAN for a specific customer.

   Let's say that S transmits a frame to destination D, which is
   connected to RB4, and let's say that D's location is learned by the
   relevant RBridges already.  The relevant RBridges have learned the
   following:

   1) RB1 has learned that D is connected to nickname 15918 
      and through remote TE-Site-Nickname 15919 with MTU 9K and
      through local N-PE RB2. and through local TE-Site-Nickname 
      15962 with MTU 9K through RB2.
   2) RB3 has learned that D is attached to nickname 44.
      and through TE-Site-Nickname 15919 with MTU 9K

   The following sequence of events will occur:

   -  S transmits an Ethernet frame with source MAC = S and destination
   MAC = D.

   -  RB1 encapsulates with a TRILL header with ingress RBridge = 27,
   and egress = 15962.

   -  RB2 has announced in the Level 1 IS-IS instance in area 15961,
   that it is attached to all the area nicknames, including 15918 and
   15919 which is just an TE-Alias for 15918. Therefore, IS-IS routes
   the frame to RB2. (Alternatively, if a distinguished range of
   nicknames is used for Level 2, Level 1 RBridges seeing such an egress
   nickname will know to route to the nearest border router, which can
   be indicated by the IS-IS attached bit.)

   -  RB2, when transitioning the frame from Level 1 to Level 2,
 


Balaji Venkat et.al      Expires September 2012                 [Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT  Interconnecting TRILL sites deploying TE      March 2012


   replaces the ingress RBridge nickname with the area nickname, so
   replaces 27 with 15962. Within Level 2, the ingress RBridge field in
   the TRILL header will therefore be 15962, and the egress RBridge
   field will be 15919 after the path characteristics matching and the
   choice of 15919 as the Egress Rbridge satisfying the said constraints
   for the TE-Path in 15919. Also RB2 learns that S is attached to
   nickname 27 in area 15962 to accommodate return traffic. This is thus
   a bi-directional TE-Path that satisfies the constraints chosen by the
   Ingress Rbridge RB1.

   -  The frame is forwarded through Level 2, to RB3, which has
   advertised, in Level 2, reachability to the nickname 15918 and 15919.

   -  RB3, when forwarding into area 15918, keeps the egress nickname in
   the TRILL header as 15919 nickname which is the TE-Path to RB4 whose
   actual nickname is 44.  So, within the destination area, the ingress
   nickname will be 15962 and the egress nickname will be 15919.

   -  RB4, when decapsulating, learns that S is attached to nickname
   15962, which is the TE-Path Site-TE-nickname of the ingress.

   Now suppose that D's location has not been learned by RB1 and/or RB3.
   What will happen, as it would in TRILL today, is that RB1 will
   forward the frame as a multi-destination frame, choosing a tree.  As
   the multi-destination frame transitions into Level 2, RB2 replaces
   the ingress nickname with the default area nickname. If RB1 does not
   know the location of D, the frame must be flooded, subject to
   possible pruning, in Level 2 and, subject to possible pruning, from
   Level 2 into every Level 1 area that it reaches on the Level 2
   distribution tree which is the MVPN PIM-bidir tree as in [1].

2.1 Extensions in IS-IS and BGP

   The TLVs in IS-IS to be added and the BGP extensions will be dealt
   with in more detail in later versions of this draft. The other TLVs
   that support creation of TE-Paths as in [7] will remain as is.
