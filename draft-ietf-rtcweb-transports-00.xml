    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The IETF RTCWEB effort, part of the WebRTC effort carried out in
      cooperation between the IETF and the W3C, is aimed at specifying a
      protocol suite that is useful for real time multimedia exchange between
      browsers.</t>

      <t>The overall effort is described in the RTCWEB overview document,
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview"></xref>. This document focuses
      on the data transport protocos that are used by conforming
      implementations.</t>

      <t>This protocol suite is designed for WebRTC, and intends to satisfy
      the security considerations described in the WebRTC security documents,
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security"></xref> and <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch"></xref>.</t>

             title="Transport and Middlebox specification">
      <t></t>

      <section title="System-provided interfaces">
        <t>The protocol specifications used here assume that the following
        protocols are available to the implementations of the RTCWEB
        protocols:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>UDP. This is the protocol assumed by most protocol elements
            described.</t>

            <t>TCP. This is used for HTTP/WebSockets, as well as for TURN/SSL
            and ICE-TCP.</t>
          </list>For both protocols, this specification assumes the ability to
        set the DSCP code point of the sockets opened. It does not assume that
        the DSCP codepoints will be honored, and does assume that they may be
        zeroed or changed, since this is a local configuration issue.</t>

        <t>This specification does not assume that the implementation will
        have access to ICMP or raw IP.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Middle box related functions">
        <t>The primary mechanism to deal with middle boxes is ICE, which is an
        appropriate way to deal with NAT boxes and firewalls that accept
        traffic from the inside, but only from the outside if it's in response
        to inside traffic (simple stateful firewalls).</t>

        <t>In order to deal with symmetric NATs, TURN MUST be supported.</t>

        <t>In order to deal with firewalls that block all UDP traffic, TURN
        over TCP MUST be supported. (QUESTION: What about ICE-TCP?)</t>

        <t>The following specifications MUST be supported:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>ICE <xref target="RFC5245"></xref></t>

            <t>TURN, including TURN over TCP [[QUESTION: and TURN over TLS]],
            <xref target="RFC5766"></xref>.</t>
          </list>For referring to STUN and TURN servers, this specification
        depends on the STUN URI, <xref
        target="I-D.nandakumar-rtcweb-stun-uri"></xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Transport protocols implemented">
        <t>For data transport over the RTCWEB data channel <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel"></xref>, RTCWEB implementations
        support SCTP over DTLS over ICE. This is specified in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-encaps"></xref>. Negotiation of this
        transport in SCTP is defined in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The setup protocol for RTCWEB data channels is described in <xref
        target="I-D.jesup-rtcweb-data-protocol"></xref>.</t>

        <t>For transport of media, secure RTP is used. The details of the
        profile of RTP used are described in "RTP Usage" <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage"></xref>.</t>

        <t>RTCWEB implementations MUST support multiplexing of SCTP/DTLS and
        RTP over the same port pair, as described in the DTLS_SRTP
        specification <xref target="RFC5764"></xref>, section 5.1.2.</t>
