Abstract

   Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) is widely deployed to signal Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs) due to its simple operational model.  Since LDP
   establishes LSPs along IGP routed paths, its failure recovery is
   gated by the interior gateway protocol's (IGP's) re-convergence.
   Though some mechanisms exist to do Fast Re-route (FRR) of LDP LSPs,
   they suffer from significant complexity or lack of full coverage or
   both.  This document describes a method to perform FRR of LDP LSPs
   that retains the simple operational model of LDP.  The goal is to
   provide 100% coverage for all failure scenarios including Shared Risk
   Link Group (SRLG) failure with recovery characteristics similar to
   the methods in Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering
   FRR (RSVP-TE-FRR).

1.  Introduction

   Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) [RFC5036] is a widely deployed
   signaling protocol in MPLS networks due to its simple operational
   model.  It signals LSPs along interior gateway protocol (IGP) routed
   paths.  In case of a failure in the network, the recovery of traffic
   on LDP LSPs is gated by reconvergence of IGPs.  IGPs have relatively
   slower convergence due to link-state database flooding, route re-
   computation, route-download etc.  An alternative is to use IP Fast
   Re-route (IPFRR) techniques to provide FRR for LDP LSPs.  This
   includes techniques such as LFA [RFC5286] that provides an alternate
   path that can also be used by LDP LSPs.  However LFA does not provide
   full coverage.  Other IPFRR methods such as NOT-VIA
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ipfrr-notvia-addresses] involve significant
   complexity.  Another approach to protect LDP LSPs is to transport
   them over RSVP-TE LSPs that are protected using RSVP-TE-FRR
   [RFC4090].  This can indirectly protect LDP LSPs.  However this has
   the complexity of deploying an additional protocol RSVP-TE [RFC3209]
   and also the network planning to setup the RSVP-TE LSPs that are
   required to adequately protect the network.

   In this document we describe a local-repair mechanism that can
   provide fast-reroute for LDP LSPs.  This mechanism retains the
   simplicity of LDPs operational model and does not require deployment
   of additional signaling protocols.  It also provides full coverage in
   all failure scenarios, including shared risk link group (SRLG)
   failures.  The mechanism in this document is henceforth referred to
   as FRR-LDP.  It aims to provide traffic recovery times similar to
   that provided by RSVP-TE-FRR [RFC4090].  This mechanism works for a
   link-state IGP such as OSPF [RFC2328] or IS-IS[ISO10589].

      SPT: Shortest Path Tree

      PLR: Point of Local Repair.  The head-end LSR of a backup-SP LSP.

      Backup-SP LSP (BSP LSP): An LDP LSP that provides a backup for a
      specific failure on the shortest path LDP LSP.  The failed entity
      may be a link, a node or a SRLG.  This LSP originates from the
      PLR.

      Backup-SP Merge Point (BSP-MP): The LSR where the Backup-SP LSP is
      label switched to a label allocated for the shortest path LDP LSP.
      It need not be downstream of the failed entity.

      Exclude-SPT: The shortest path tree from a PLR to a destination,
      when a particular failure point (link, node, SRLG) is excluded
      from the topology.


4.  Notation

   We use the notation L:X-A to denote the label that LSR A allocates
   for FEC X for the shortest path LSP to X. We also use the notation
   Lb:X-A to denote the BSP-LSP label allocated by LSR A for FEC X. The
   label actions that are setup by LSR A for such a label are explained
   in detail later in the document.


5.  LDP local repair technique

   In a shortest path routed network, unicast traffic to a destination
   flows along a multi-point to point (MP2P) tree/graph towards that
   destination.  When a failure occurs in such a network, traffic from
   nodes that are upstream from the failed entity on the MP2P tree gets
   affected.  However, traffic along the tree that is not upstream of
   the failed entity does not get affected.  This is true even when the
   destination is multi-homed and/or the failed entity consists of
   several components e.g.  SRLG failure.

   A PLR protects against a failure detected on its link by re-routing
   LSPs having that link as a nexthop, along pre-computed and pre-
   programmed backup paths.  The failed entity may be just the link or
   could be the entire adjacent LSR or even an SRLG with several
   components.  The backup path for a protected LSP must go from the PLR
   to a LSR (a.k.a Merge Point - MP) that is not upstream of the failed
   entity in the MP2P tree for that shortest-path protected LSP's
   destination.  Note that the backup path may have to avoid multiple
   components of the failure e.g., to protect against SRLG failures it
   must avoid all the components of the SRLG.  If there exists a

   shortest path LDP LSP that is along a backup path for a LSP, i.e. a
   shortest-path LDP LSP from the PLR to a LSR that is not upstream of
   the failure, then it should be used for protection.  Such a shortest
   path LSP is called a Backup Shortest Path LSP (BSP-LSP) and the
   egress of that LSP which is also the MP is referred to as a backup
   shortest path merge point (BSP-MP).  The PLR must learn the label
   allocated by the BSP-MP for the protected LSP's destination.  The
   protocol mechanism for to setup the BSP-LSP and for the PLR to learn
   the label allocated by the BSP-MP for the protected LSP are described
   in detail later.

   To protect against a failure the PLR first swaps the incoming label
   of the protected shortest-path LDP LSP with the one allocated by the
   BSP-MP for the destination corresponding to the protected shortest-
   path LDP LSP.  It then tunnels the MPLS frame over the BSP-LSP.  All
   these actions are pre-computed, so that at the time of failure the
   PLR has to perform a small change of the label forwarding actions to
   protect the traffic.  This helps to recover the traffic in sub
   50msec.

   A simple example is illustrated below in Figure 1.  LSR P protects a
   LSP to Z against failure of link P-S by using the shortest-path LSP
   from P to M i.e. the LSP P-Q-M.  LSR P would trigger a protection
   switch action when link P-S fails that would swap label L:Z-P with
   L:Z-M, and then tunnel the packet through the shortest-path LSP from
   P to M by pushing the label L:M-Q and uses nexthop of the shortest-
   path LSP from P to M i.e. link P-Q.  It should be noted that the
   shortest-path LSP from PLR to BSP-MP i.e., from P to M or P-Q-M that
   was used as a BSP-LSP would continue to be on the same path even
   after a failure that it is protecting from.  It should also be noted
   that a BSP-LSP can protect multiple LSPs as long as the BSP-MP is not
   upstream of the failure entity in the MP2P trees of all the protected
   LSPs.

                    Figure 1: Backup Shortest Path LSP

   A shortest path LDP LSP may not exist from the PLR to an LSR that is
   upstream of the failure entity on the MP2P tree.  A simple example is
   illustrated in Figure 2.  In such a case the backup path LSP would
   have non shortest-path forwarding links in it.  The backup LSP must
   take the path P-Q-M that is not a shortest-path LSP from P to M
   (which is P-S-R-M).  However the shortest-path LSP cannot be used
   since it goes through the failure entity that needs to be protected
   against i.e. link P-S.  The backup path LSP P-Q-M would need label
   forwarding onto links that are not along the shortest-path LSP from
   PLR to BSP-MP.  In this case LSR Q would have to allocate an
   additional label to forward the traffic on the backup path i.e. to
   LSR M. So LSR Q allocates a label Lb:Q-M that has an action of pop
   when Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP) is the mode of operation and
   forward along the link Q-M.  The protocol mechanisms to signal label
   Lb:Q-M from Q to P are described later in this document.

   Figure 2: Backup Shortest Path LSP with non shortest-path forwarding

   By selecting the backup path as the shortest path in the topology
   with the failure entity removed, the traffic churn after the failure
   can be minimized.  We continue to denote the backup path LSP as BSP-
   LSP and note that the shortest-path is in the topology with the
   failure entity removed.  If any segment of this path can use existing
   LDP shortest path LSPs, it would reduce the additional forwarding
   state needed for the backup LSP.  Hence it is recommended that the
   shortest path LSPs be used as segments in the BSP-LSP wherever
   possible and keep the non shortest-path links along the BSP-LSP to
   the minimum.  In that case only those LSRs along the backup LSP that
   routes the backup LSP to a non shortest path link need to allocate
   additional labels to create the backup LSP.

   An example in Figure 3 illustrates how a shortest-path LSP used as a
   segment in a BSP-LSP reduces forwarding state in intermediate LSRs.
   LSR P protects the LSP to Z from failure of the link P-S.  The BSP-
   LSP is P-T-Q-M and consists of a shortest-path LSP P-T-Q.  Only Q
   allocates an additional label to forward the packet along the link
   Q-M.  This label has to be advertised to P. LSR T does not have any
   additional state for the BSP-LSP.  For the protected LSP going to Z,
   P installs an action to swap the label L:Z-P to L:Z-M and push the
   label Lb:M-Q in order to tunnel the packet to the BSP-MP i.e.  M. LSR
   P additionally pushes the label L:Q-T with a nexthop of link P-T to
   follow the shortest-path LSP from P to Q. These actions are triggered
   on detecting failure of link P-S.

   Figure 3: Backup Shortest Path LSP with non shortest-path forwarding
                      and a shortest-path LSP segment

   A slightly more complex topology in Figure 4 illustrates how a
   combination of shortest path LSPs and non shortest-path links are
   combined to create a BSP-LSP.  PLR P protects against failure of node
   X by creating a backup LSP P-T-Q-S-R-M.  The shortest path LSP Q-S-R
   can be used as a segment of the BSP-LSP.  Since LSRs R and T need to
   forward the packet on a non shortest-path LSP nexthop, they allocate
   additional labels to create the BSP-LSP.  Other LSRs along the BSP-
   LSP such as S do not have any additional state for the BSP-LSP.

   Figure 4: Backup Shortest Path LSP with non shortest-path forwarding
                      and a shortest-path LSP segment

   There will be a maximum of two additional labels stacked on the
   packet as it goes along the BSP-LSP.  An advantage of using the
   shortest-path (in the post failure topology) as the backup path is
   that existing shortest path algorithms can be re-used by simply
   computing it on topologies with the failure entity removed.  Since
   FRR-LDP is a local repair mechanism, an LSR computes BSP-LSPs only
   for failures of its immediate nexthops i.e. links/nodes/SRLGs.

   It should be noted that the BSP-LSP becomes a single hop LSP when a
   Loop Free Alternate (LFA) is present.  In such cases the LFA could be
   used and the mechanisms in this draft can be applied only for those
   cases where an LFA is not available.  FRR-LDP can be viewed as an
   extension to LFA with the additional benefit that it provides full
   failure coverage against link/node/SRLG failures.

   Additional label advertisements are needed for FRR-LDP to function as
   described above.  Firstly the PLR needs the label that the BSP-MP has
   allocated for the FEC corresponding to the protected LSP.  Secondly,
   labels should be allocated and advertised for the BSP-LSP when an LSR
   has to route the BSP-LSP along a non shortest-path nexthop.  The
   latter is of course not applicable if the BSP-LSP is itself a

   shortest-path LSP, in which case LDP would signal it with existing
   procedures.

   To signal the label of the FEC of the protected LSP from the BSP-MP
   to the PLR, a targeted LDP session should be used.  Note that the PLR
   is not interested in all label mappings from a BSP-MP.  It is
   interested only in those mappings for which it will tunnel packets to
   that BSP-MP on a local failure.  The PLR should use the Downstream on
   Demand (DoD) mode to request from the BSP-MP, the specific label
   mappings that it is interested in.

   As explained earlier the BSP-LSP is a LSP that goes from the PLR to
   the BSP-MP and is the shortest-path from PLR to the BSP-MP in the
   topology where a failed entity is removed.  That failed entity is
   local to the PLR, though it may have additional components that are
   non-local to the PLR in case of a SRLG failure.  To signal labels for
   such a LSP using LDP procedures, the label mappings are defined for a
   combination of the FEC and the failed-entity.  The failed entity is
   identified by a new TLV called "Failure Entity TLV", defined in
   Section 6.1.  It is modeled as a simplified version of the
   EXCLUDE_ROUTE object XRO [RFC4874].  The presence of the "Failure
   Entity TLV" indicates that the LDP message is for a BSP-LSP.  To
   identify the path that the BSP-LSP should take, a new TLV called the
   "Backup Path Vector TLV" is defined in Section 6.2.  This TLV is
   modeled as a simplified version of the Explicit Route Object (ERO) in
   RSVP-TE [RFC3209].  The PLR uses this TLV to route the LSP along a
   path that is not the shortest-path to the BSP-MP in the current
   topology but will be the shortest-path in the topology with the
   failure entity removed.  The PLR uses the Label Request message with
   the FEC of an address of the BSP-MP, the "Failure Entity TLV" and the
   "Backup Path Vector TLV" to request a label from the downstream LSR.
   Further details of how the "Backup Path Vector TLV" is processed is
   described in Section 6.2.


6.  Protocol procedures and extensions

   To create the BSP-LSP the PLR can compute the path for the BSP-LSP.

   If a shortest-path LSP can be used as a BSP-LSP then no extra
   protocol procedures are required to setup the BSP-LSP.  The PLR just
   needs to get the label corresponding to the FEC of the protected LSP
   from the BSP-MP.  This can be done by setting up a targeted LDP
   session from PLR to the BSP-MP.  This can be a session that is setup
   dynamically rather than being statically configured.  Its setup is
   initiated by the PLR after the backup path computation that
   determines which LSRs becomes BSP-MPs for its local failures.  The
   labels should be advertised from BSP-MP to the PLR in a DoD mode.

   If the path calculated for the BSP-LSP is not along a shortest path
   from the PLR to the BSP-MP, then the PLR initiates a Downstream on
   Demand (DoD) signaling mechanism defined in LDP [RFC5036] to setup
   the BSP-LSP.  Some extensions to the DoD mechanism are defined here.
   A 'Failure Entity TLV' defined in Section 6.1 is included in all
   messages that signal the BSP-LSP.  Together with the FEC it uniquely
   identifies the LSP that corresponds to the signaling message.  The
   PLR also includes a Backup Path Vector TLV in the label request that
   indicates the path of the BSP-LSP.  The Backup Path Vector TLV is
   modeled as a simplified version of the ERO defined in RSVP-TE
   [RFC3209].  The PLR initiates a Label Request message to the
   immediate nexthop LSR that in turn generate Label Request messages
   hop-by-hop by following the Backup Path Vector TLV.  When the BSP-MP
   receives the Label Request it responds with a Label Mapping message.
   Successive Label Mapping messages are generated by intermediate LSRs
   till one reaches the PLR and the BSP-LSP is set up.  Note that the
   PLR additionally needs the label from the BSP-MP for the protected
   LSP's FEC and it continues to get that as explained earlier.

   A BSP-LSP along a path that is not a shortest-path from the PLR to
   the BSP-MP can have segments where it is tunneled through shortest-
   path LSPs.  The PLR signals such segments in the "Backup Path Vector
   TLV".  The head-end LSR of such a segment can decide how the LSP is
   going to be signaled across the segment.  It must support a method
   where it is signaled on a hop-by-hop basis where the intermediate
   LSRs on the shortest-path LSP tunnel do not allocate any labels for
   the BSP-LSP.  Alternately the head-end LSR may use a targeted LDP
   session to the tail-end LSR of the shortest-path segment and send the
   Label Request message.

6.1.  Failure Entity TLV

   A Failure entity TLV is defined to specify the topological entity
   whose failure is being referenced in the signaling messages of the
   BSP-LSP.  Together with the FEC it uniquely identifies a label
   mapping of the BSP-LSP.  This TLV is modeled as a simple version of
   the EXCLUDE_ROUTE Object defined in Exclude Routes [RFC4874].  This
   TLV must be present in the Label Request message, Label Withdraw
   message, Label Release message, Label Mapping Message and the
   Notification message when the BSP-LSP is signaled.

   This TLV consists of one of these TLVs

       Label Mapping message for the FEC corresponding to that address.

   2.  If the first entry is its own address but it is not the only
       entry in the Backup Path Vector TLV, then it allocates a label to
       be sent in response i.e. the Label Mapping message.  It also
       generates a Label Request message towards the IP address in the
       next entry of the Backup Path Vector TLV.  This Label Request
       will include the Backup Path Vector TLV with the first entry
       removed.  The way the Label Request is generated depends on the
       "Hop Type"

       A.  If the "Hop Type"is 0 (Non shortest-path link) then the Label
           Request is sent to that directly connected neighboring LSR.
           When a reponse is received via a Label Mapping message, a
           label swap operation from the label it allocated to the label
           received with forwarding towards that IP address of the
           neighboring LSR.

       B.  If the "Hop Type" is 1 (Shortest path LSP) then the LSR must
           support generating the Label Request on that shortest-path
           LSP segment on a hop-by-hop basis.  In this method it sends
           the Label Request to a nexthop LSR along the shortest-path
           LSP.  Alternately it may support sending the Label Request on
           a targeted LDP session to the tail-end of the shortest-path
           LSP.  When it receives a response to this Label Request
           message via a Label mapping message, then it installs a label
           swap operation from the label it allocated to the label
           received from the downstream LSR with a label forward action
           to tunnel it over the shortest-path LSP.

       C.  If the "Hop Type" is 2 (Inter-area LSP) then this LSR is an
           area border LSR that must compute a path that avoids the
           Failure Entity and then generates a Label Request further
           downstream.

   3.  If the first entry is not its own address then it generates a
       Label Request message towards the IP address in the first entry
       of the Backup Path Vector TLV by choosing one of the LSRs on the
       nexthop.  It does not change the Backup Path Vector TLV in this
       case.  Also it does not allocate a label.  When it receives a
       response in the form of a Label Mapping message it generates a
       corresponding Label Mapping message to the upstream LSR.
