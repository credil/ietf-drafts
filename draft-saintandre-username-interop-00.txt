                  draft-saintandre-username-interop-00

Abstract

   Various Internet protocols have defined constructs for usernames.
   This document describes a subset of characters to allow in usernames
   for maximal interoperability across Internet protocols.  The subset
   might prove useful in cases where a provider offers multiple services
   using the same underlying identifier.

Internet-Draft          Username Interoperability               May 2013


1.  Introduction

   Various Internet protocols have defined constructs for usernames.
   This document describes a subset of characters to allow in usernames
   for maximal interoperability across Internet protocols.  The subset
   might prove useful in cases where a provider offers multiple services
   using the same underlying identifier.


2.  Subset

   The following definition, in Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   [RFC5234], describes an interoperable subset of characters for
   localparts / usernames:

      localpart    =  1*(interopchar)
      interopchar  =  ALPHA / DIGIT / "!" / "$" / "*" / "+"
                      / "-" / "=" / "_" / "`" / "|" / "~"

   The reasoning behind this subset is provided in Appendix A.

   An internationalized version would add the 'ucschar' rule from
   [RFC3987].  However, note that allowing characters outside the ASCII
   range [RFC20] can introduce numerous complexities; such issues are
   discussed in [I-D.ietf-precis-framework] among other specifications.


3.  Security Considerations

   Deploying usernames that are interoperable across multiple protocols
   could potentially give malicious entities multiple ways to attack an
   account or user.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for the IANA.

Internet-Draft          Username Interoperability               May 2013


Appendix A.  Analysis

   This document takes the following username constructs into
   consideration:

   o  Email addresses [RFC5322]
   o  Kerberos Principal Names [RFC4120]
   o  Network Address Identifiers [RFC4282]
   o  SIP URIs [RFC3261]
   o  Instant messaging URIs [RFC3860] and presence URIs [RFC3856]
   o  XMPP addresses (a.k.a.  Jabber Identifiers) [RFC6120]
   o  Account URIs [I-D.ietf-appsawg-acct-uri]

   Each of those address formats defines something that can be used as
   the "local part" of an address.

   The local part of an email address uses either the "local-part" or
   the "dot-atom-text" rule in [RFC5322].  Here we make the simplifying
   assumption that the "dot-atom-text" rule applies:

      dot-atom-text =  1*atext *("." 1*atext)
      atext         =  ALPHA / DIGIT /    ; Any character except
                       "!" / "#" / "$" /  ; controls, SP, and
                       "%" / "&" / "'" /  ; specials. Used for
                       "*" / "+" / "-" /  ; atoms.
                       "/" / "=" / "?" /
                       "^" / "_" / "`" /
                       "{" / "|" / "}" /
                       "~"

   We make the same simplifying assumption for im: and pres: URIs
   (although their specifications reference [RFC2822]).

   A Kerberos Principal Name is a sequence of strings of type
   KerberosString, where each KerberosString is a GeneralString that is
   constrained to contain only characters in IA5String.

      PrincipalName   ::= SEQUENCE {
              name-type       [0] Int32,
              name-string     [1] SEQUENCE OF KerberosString
      }
      KerberosString  ::= GeneralString (IA5String)

   A Network Address Identifier inherits from [RFC821].  Here we care
   only about the "username" rule:

   The local part of a sip:/sips: URI inherits from the "userinfo" rule
   in [RFC3986] with several changes; here we discuss the SIP "user"
   rule only:

      user             =  1*( unreserved / escaped / user-unreserved )
      user-unreserved  =  "&" / "=" / "+" / "$" / "," / ";" / "?" / "/"
      unreserved       =  alphanum / mark
      mark             =  "-" / "_" / "." / "!" / "~" / "*" / "'"
                          / "(" / ")"

   The local part of an XMPP address allows any ASCII character except
   space, controls, and the " & ' / : < > @ characters.

   The 'acct' URI syntax borrows the 'host', 'pct-encoded', 'sub-
   delims', 'unreserved' rules from [RFC3986]:

   acctURI      =  "acct" ":" userpart "@" host
   userpart     =  unreserved / sub-delims
                   0*( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims )

   To summarize the foregoing information, the following table lists the
   allowed and disallowed characters in the local part of identifiers
   for each protocol (aside from the alphanumeric, space, and control
   characters), in order by hexadecimal character number (where each "A"
   row shows the allowed characters and each "D" row shows the
   disallowed characters).
