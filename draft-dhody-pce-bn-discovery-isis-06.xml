      <t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) may be used for computing multi-domain (Area or AS) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineered (TE) Label Switch Path (LSP).</t>
      <t>In this circumstance, it is highly desirable to be able to dynamically and automatically discover a set of Boundary Nodes (BN) along with their domain information.  For that purpose, this document defines extensions to the Intermediate System to Intermediate System(IS-IS) routing protocol for the advertisement of Boundary Node (BN)Discovery information within an IS-IS area or within the entire IS-IS routing domain.</t>

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>This document defines extensions to IS-IS <xref target="ISO 10589"/> to allow a boundary node in an IS-IS routing domain to advertise its location, along with domain information.</t>
      <t>Generic capability advertisement mechanisms for IS-IS are defined in <xref target="RFC4971"/>.  These allow a router to advertise its capabilities within an IS-IS area or an entire IS-IS routing domain.  This document leverages this generic capability advertisement mechanism to fully satisfy the dynamic BN discovery.</t>
      <t>This document defines a new sub-TLV (named the BN Discovery (BND))to be carried within the IS-IS Router Capability TLV (<xref target="RFC4971"/>).</t>
      <t>The BN information advertised is detailed in <xref target="SEC_OVERVIEW"/>.  Protocol extensions and procedures are defined in <xref target="SEC_BND"/> and <xref target="SEC_PROC"/>.</t>
      <t>A detailed description about the need for auto discovery of Boundary Nodes (BN) and thier domains is also provided in this document.</t>
      <t>The IS-IS extensions defined in this document allow for BN discovery within an IS-IS routing domain.  Boundary Node can be an Area Border Router (ABR) or Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR).</t>
      <t>This document defines a set of sub-TLVs that are nested within each other.  When the degree of nesting TLVs is 2 (a TLV is carried within another TLV) the TLV carried within a TLV is called a sub-TLV. Strictly speaking, when the degree of nesting is 3, a sub-sub-TLV is carried within a sub-TLV that is itself carried within a TLV.  For the sake of terminology simplicity, a TLV carried within another TLV is called a sub-TLV regardless of the degree of nesting.</t>

    <section title="Applications" toc="default">
      <t>Backward Recursive Path Computation (BRPC) procedure as defined in <xref target="RFC5441"/>, requires Path Computation Element (PCE) <xref target="RFC4655"/> to be aware of the BNs for the inter-domain path computation. This information would be either statically configured at PCE or learned via some mechanism, as listed in <xref target="SEC_OTHER"/>. </t>
      <t>In case of static configuration, as shown in the <xref target="fig1"/>, incase of ISIS Backbone area(L2), configuration of BNs at PCE5 is extensive.  BRPC procedure guarantees a best path only if BNs are selected correctly, any change in BNs at run time may lead to sub-optimal path.  Also Administrator need to configure ABR / ASBR ID in such a way that it is reachable   from all the domains, BND Tlv can take care of this automatically.</t>

    <section title="Static Configurations" toc="default">
      <t>A simple solution would be to configure BNs [ABR and ASBR] at PCE(s) along with their domain information.  As this information is fairly static this could work in simple situations.  But as PCE are being used in bigger and multiple domains, any sort of static configurations would put extra effort on the system administrator. Selection of correct BNs is the core of the BRPC procedure, we feel this information should be dynamically learned and maintained.</t>

    <section title="Importance of Domain Information along with BNs" toc="default" anchor="SEC_DOMAIN">
      <t>There are methods to learn BNs dynamically from IGP, but the knowledge of neighboring-domains is not possible to obtain.  Without this the correct BN based on the domain-path can't be selected.  <xref target="RFC5441"/> mentions:</t>
      <t>"Note that PCE(i) only considers the entry BNs of domain(i), i.e., only the BNs that provide connectivity from domain(i-1).  In other words, the set BN-en(k,i) is only made of those BNs that provide connectivity from domain (i-1) to domain(i).  "</t>
      <t>This selection of correct BNs providing connectivity between correct domains cannot be made by the information obtained from IGP.  Without the correct selection we would not be following <xref target="RFC5441"/>.</t>

That is, the TLV is comprised of 1 octet for the type, 1 octet specifying the TLV length, and a value field.  The Length field defines the length of the value portion in octets.</t>

      <t>The flooding scope is controlled by the S flag in the IS-IS Router Capability TLV (see <xref target="RFC4971"/>).  When the scope of the BND sub-TLV is area local, it MUST be carried within an IS-IS Router Capability TLV having the S bit cleared.  When the scope of the BND sub-TLV is the entire IS-IS routing domain, it MUST be carried within an IS-IS Router Capability TLV having the S bit set.</t>
      <t>Note that an L1L2 node may include a BND TLV in a Router Capability TLV with the S bit cleared in both in its L1 and L2 LSPs.  This allows the flooding scope to be restricted to the L1 area and the L2 sub-domain.</t>
      <t>When the BN function is deactivated, the IS-IS speaker MUST originate a new IS-IS LSP that no longer includes the corresponding BND TLV.</t>

      <t>The BND sub-TLV information regarding a specific BN is only considered current and useable when the router advertising this information is itself reachable via IS-IS calculated paths at the   level of the LSP in which the BND sub-TLV appears.</t>
      <t>A change in the state of a BN (activate, deactivate, domain change) MUST result in a corresponding change in the BND sub-TLV information advertised by an IS-IS router (inserted, removed, updated) in its LSP.  The way BNs determine the information they advertise, and how that information is made available to IS-IS, is out of the scope of this document.  Some information may be configured and other information may be automatically determined by ISIS.</t>
      <t>A change in information in the BND sub-TLV MUST NOT trigger any SPF computation at a receiving router.</t>

      <t>The BND TLV defined in this document does not introduce any interoperability issues.</t>

      <t>This document defines IS-IS extensions for BN discovery within an administrative domain.  Hence the security of the BN discovery relies on the security of IS-IS.</t>
      <t>Mechanisms defined to ensure authenticity and integrity of IS-IS LSPs <xref target="RFC5304"/> and their TLVs, can be used to secure the BND sub-TLV as well.</t>
      <t>IS-IS provides no encryption mechanism for protecting the privacy of LSPs and, in particular, the privacy of the BN discovery information.</t>
