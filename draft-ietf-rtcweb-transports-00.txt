Internet-Draft              WebRTC Transports                August 2013


1.  Introduction

   The IETF RTCWEB effort, part of the WebRTC effort carried out in
   cooperation between the IETF and the W3C, is aimed at specifying a
   protocol suite that is useful for real time multimedia exchange
   between browsers.

   The overall effort is described in the RTCWEB overview document,
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview].  This document focuses on the data
   transport protocos that are used by conforming implementations.

   This protocol suite is designed for WebRTC, and intends to satisfy
   the security considerations described in the WebRTC security
   documents, [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security] and
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch].


2.  Transport and Middlebox specification

2.1.  System-provided interfaces

   The protocol specifications used here assume that the following
   protocols are available to the implementations of the RTCWEB
   protocols:

   o  UDP.  This is the protocol assumed by most protocol elements
      described.

   o  TCP.  This is used for HTTP/WebSockets, as well as for TURN/SSL
      and ICE-TCP.

   For both protocols, this specification assumes the ability to set the
   DSCP code point of the sockets opened.  It does not assume that the
   DSCP codepoints will be honored, and does assume that they may be
   zeroed or changed, since this is a local configuration issue.

   This specification does not assume that the implementation will have
   access to ICMP or raw IP.

2.2.  Middle box related functions

   The primary mechanism to deal with middle boxes is ICE, which is an
   appropriate way to deal with NAT boxes and firewalls that accept
   traffic from the inside, but only from the outside if it's in
   response to inside traffic (simple stateful firewalls).

   In order to deal with symmetric NATs, TURN MUST be supported.

   In order to deal with firewalls that block all UDP traffic, TURN over
   TCP MUST be supported.  (QUESTION: What about ICE-TCP?)

   The following specifications MUST be supported:

   o  ICE [RFC5245]

   o  TURN, including TURN over TCP [[QUESTION: and TURN over TLS]],
      [RFC5766].

   For referring to STUN and TURN servers, this specification depends on
   the STUN URI, [I-D.nandakumar-rtcweb-stun-uri].

2.3.  Transport protocols implemented

   For data transport over the RTCWEB data channel
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel], RTCWEB implementations support SCTP
   over DTLS over ICE.  This is specified in
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-encaps].  Negotiation of this transport in
   SCTP is defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp].

   The setup protocol for RTCWEB data channels is described in
   [I-D.jesup-rtcweb-data-protocol].

   For transport of media, secure RTP is used.  The details of the
   profile of RTP used are described in "RTP Usage"
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage].

   RTCWEB implementations MUST support multiplexing of SCTP/DTLS and RTP
   over the same port pair, as described in the DTLS_SRTP specification
   [RFC5764], section 5.1.2.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


4.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations are enumerated in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security].
