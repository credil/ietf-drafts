Internet-Draft     App of LDP MT for Unicast MRT FRR          April 2013


1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture] describes the architecture
   based on Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT) to provide 100% coverage for
   fast-reroute of unicast traffic.  LDP multi-topology
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-multi-topology] has been proposed to provide
   multi-topology-based unicast forwarding in the architecture.
   Guidance is provided for different application scenarios to improve
   the applicability.  The analysis of the applicability of LDP MT for
   unicast fast-reroute using MRT is provided.  The procedures are
   described and typical examples are provided based on LDP MT and MRT
   unicast FRR architecture.

   When LDP MT is combined with MRT FRR, follow advantages can be
   achieved:

   o  Provide 100% coverage for unicast traffic.

   o  The complexity of the algorithm is moderate in O(e) or o( e + n
      log n ).

   o  Co-deployment with LFA to provide better protection coverage.

   o  Simplify operation and management with few additional
      configurations and states introduced.

   o  Inherit procedures of LDP to achieve high scalability.

   o  Propose no additional change on label forwarding behavior in the
      forwarding plane to facilitate incremental deployment.

2.  Terminology

   Some of terminologies defined in the
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture] are repeated here for the
   clarity of this document.

   o  2-connected: A graph that has no cut-vertices.  This is a graph
      that requires two nodes to be removed before the network is
      partitioned.

   o  2-connected cluster: A maximal set of nodes that are 2-connected.

   o  2-edge-connected: A network graph where at least two links must be
      removed to partition the network.

   o  cut-link: A link whose removal partitions the network.  A cut-link
      by definition must be connected between two cut-vertices.  If

      there are multiple parallel links, then they are referred to as
      cut-links in this document if removing the set of parallel links
      would partition the network.

   o  cut-vertex: A vertex whose removal partitions the network.

   o  ECMP Equal cost multi-path: Where, for a particular destination D,
      multiple primary next-hops are used to forward traffic because
      there exist multiple shortest paths from S via different output
      layer-3 interfaces.

   o  FIB Forwarding Information Base.  The database used by the packet
      forwarder to determine what actions to perform on a packet.

   o  LFA Loop-Free Alternate.  A neighbor N, that is not a primary
      neighbor E, whose shortest path to the destination D does not go
      back through the router S.  The neighbor N must meet the following
      condition: Distance_opt(N, D)<Distance_opt(N,S)+Distance_opt(S,D)

   o  Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT): A pair of trees where the path
      from any node X to the root R along the first tree and the path
      from the same node X to the root along the second tree share the
      minimum number of nodes and the minimum number of links.  Each
      such shared node is a cut-vertex.  Any shared links are cut-links.
      Any RT is an MRT but many MRTs are not RTs.

   o  Redundant Trees (RT): A pair of trees where the path from any node
      X to the root R along the first tree is node-disjoint with the
      path from the same node X to the root along the second tree.
      These can be computed in 2-connected graphs.

   o  SPF Shortest Path First, e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm.

   o  SPT Shortest path tree

3.  Operation Procedures

3.1.  Routing Calculation

   IGP will flood information related with MRT FRR of each router and
   calculate routes for all destinations based on MRT.  The details for
   the algorithm can refer to [I-D.enyedi-rtgwg-mrt-frr-algorithm].  For
   each destination, there are at least three routes that are associated
   with default topology, red topology and blue topology.  The route of
   red topology or blue topology will be chosen as the secondary route.
   During the routing calculation, consistency of all nodes in the
   network must be kept.  In order to achieve the consistence, following
   rules should be specified for the MRT calculation:

   -- rules for choosing the root node;

   -- rules for choosing the next-hop in the blue topology and the red
   topology.

   Rules for choosing the secondary route can be determined locally if
   multiple routes exist.  According to
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture], the secondary route derived
   from LFA calculation is preferred since it exists in the default
   topology.  If there is no secondary route of LFA, the secondary route
   will be chosen in the blue topology or the red topology.

3.2.  Label Distribution

   When LDP MT is used for MRT fast-reroute, LDP will negotiate the MT
   Capability with LDP peer.  Once IGP calculates routes for
   destinations based on MRT, LDP will advertise label mapping message
   with corresponding MT-ID for the specific FEC.  There are at least
   three label bindings for each FEC that are associated with default
   topology, red topology and blue topology.  We use L_primary for the
   label binding of the default topology, L_blue for the label binding
   of the blue topology and L_red for the label binding of the red
   topology.

   MT-IDs, used in IGP and LDP, for the blue topology and the red
   topology can be specified administratively.  In order to avoid
   inconsistency and simplify operation and management, we suggest MT-
   IDs should be reserved for MRT fast-reroute usage and the MT-IDs used
   in IP and LDP should be consistent.

3.3.  Forwarding Entry Creation

   LDP creates label fording entry for each FEC in different topologies.
   The route calculated based on MRT determines which label binding
   should be chosen for each FEC in a specific topology.  For the
   default topology, the secondary label forwarding entry is determined
   by the secondary route in the blue topology or the red topology.
   Though the forwarding entry need be chosen according to MT
   information, there is not any MT information which should be
   processed in the forwarding plane so that the existing label
   forwarding mechanism can be reused well for MRT fast-reroute.

3.4.  Switchover and Re-Convergence

   When failure happens, the traffic can be switched to the secondary
   forwarding entry by forwarding plane within 50ms.  The control plane
   will do the re-convergence process according to the link state
   change.  During the course of re-convergence, the micro-loop may be

   produced.  The methods proposed by [RFC5714] can be used to prevent
   such micro-loop.

   MRT fast-reroute calculation should be delayed.  Thus the MRT
   topologies are carrying traffic and should not be disrupted until the
   new SPF routes are installed everywhere so that traffic is moved off
   of the MRT topologies.  This way can prevent traffic loss to some
   extent.  On the other hand, if failure happens again in the delayed
   period of MRT FRR calculation, it may cause traffic loss since the
   secondary route entry can not be guaranteed.

3.5.  Switchback

   When link failure or node failure recovers, IGP-LDP synchronization
   should be used for the default topology to prevent traffic loss.
   During the period of IGP-LDP synchronization, MRT FRR calculation can
   also be done.  It will provide a best-effort protection if failure
   happens in the period.

4.  Application Scenario Analysis

4.1.  2-Connected Network

   In order to explain how LDP MT works for MRT FRR, we choose the
   following typical topology as an example.  In the figure, (a) is the
   original topology, (b) is the blue topology calculated by MRT and (c)
   is the red topology calculated by MRT.

   According to the MRT calculation, for a specific destination H, there
   are following paths in different topologies for other nodes,

                       Figure 2: Paths in Different Topologies for H


   Note:

   1.  Assume that the metric of {E,R}, {D,H}, {R,C}, {G,I} and {F,I} is
   extreme high so that the route of the default topology is reasonable.

   2.  Assume tie-breaking rules determine that in blue topology the
   route from G to H chooses the path G->H instead of G->I->J->H.

   3.  Assume tie-breaking rules determine that in red topology the
   route from I to H chooses the path I->G->F->B->A->R->E->D->H instead
   of I->F->B->A->R->E->D->H.

   4.  For D node, both blue topology and red topology are available for
   the backup.  The blue topology is preferred.

   From the above calculation example, we can see that how the tie-
   breaking rule has to be applied when choose the nexthop in a specific
   topology and the topology which is used for the secondary route.  For
   the reason of simplicity, there is no LFA calculation for the
   secondary route.  If exists, it should be preferred.

   We assume that labels are allocated in different topologies as the
   following figure.

   Note:

   1.  "<--" means the direction in which the label is distributed.  For
   example, "<--" from D to E means that the label is distributed by D
   to E.

   2.  L means the label for H distributed in the default topology.  Lb
   means the label for H distributed in the blue topology.  Lr means the
   label for H distributed in the red topology.

   3.  L distributed by different nodes in the default topology does not
   mean they must be the same.  This is also applied to Lb and Lr.

   According to above MRT calculation result and label allocation for
   multi-topology, following forwarding entries will be installed for
   each node:

   Note:

   1.  For an ingress label forwarding entry as follows, when forward, L
   will be pushed and sent to the next hop A.  If failure happens, Lr
   will be pushed and sent to the next hop E.

       Ingress    --/L  A
                    /Lr E


   2.  For a transit label forwarding entry as follows, when packet with
   the incoming label L arrives, L will be swapped to L and sent to the
   next hop A.  If failure happens, L will be swapped to Lr and sent to
   the next hop E.

       Transit     L/L  A

   Above forwarding entries construct the label switch path used for
   fast-reroute in the forwarding plane.  We can see that the existing
   MPLS label forwarding can be used without any extension.

   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture] proposes following
   non-2-connected network.

                       Figure 5: A non-2-connected network


   We will not explain how LDP MT is applied for the MRT FRR in detail.
   We choose the node I as the destination and choose R and F to observe
   how MRT and LDP MT work for fast-reroute.

   According to MRT calculation, the path from R to I in the blue
   topology is R->A->B->F->G->J->I and the path from R to I in the red
   topology is R->E->D->F->G->I.  We assume in the default topology the
   path from R to I is R->C->D->F->G->I.  Then following forwarding
   entry will be created in the node R for the destination I.

                    Figure 6: Label Forwarding Entry of Node R for FEC I


   For the node F, the path from F to I in the blue topology is
   F->G->J->I and the path in the red is F->G->I.  We assume in the
   default topology the path from F to I is F->G->I.  The following
   forwarding entry will be created in the node F for the destination I.

                  Figure 7: Label Forwarding Entry of Node F for FEC I


   We can see that there is no secondary route in the node F for the
   destination I and correspondingly there is no LDP FRR forwarding
   entry.

4.3.  Proxy Node

   There are several application scenarios proposed by
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture] which will use proxy node for
   MRT.  That is, if a set of prefixes are advertised by border routers
   of an MRT island, a single proxy node can be used to represent the
   set and the proxy node and associated links are added to the network
   topology for MRT calculation.  The application scenarios include
   inter-area, inter-AS and partial deployment of compatible MRT FRR
   routers.

4.4.  Inter-Area and Inter-AS

   For Inter-area scenarios, it is desirable to go back to the default
   forwarding topology when leaving an area/level.  There are two
   mechanisms proposed by [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture].  The
   first one is that ABR will advertise different labels for one
   specific FEC in different areas.  The second one is that penultimate
   hop pop is done through additional computation by the penultimate
   router along the in-local-area MRT immediately before the ARB/LBR is
   reached.  The first one need change of the traditional label
   allocation method for LDP which always distributes the same label for
   one FEC to all peers.  When the second one used, it must be

   guaranteed that the IP forwarding should be done by ABR.  If there is
   an inner label, it will cause wrong forwarding behavior.  Since it is
   difficult to determine the type of the packet, the second mechanism
   must be used carefully.  In order to optimize the second mechanism,
   when the penultimate router receive a packet with MRT label, it can
   swap the label to corresponding FEC's default topology label instead
   of penultimate hop pop.

   According to the label distribution and MRT computation as shown in

   For inter-AS scenarios, prefixes advertised by ASBRs will set up LSP
   in the default topology as proxy egress.  The number of prefixes will
   have great effect on the label allocation of LDP.  When MRT fast-
   reroute deploys, it should be confirmed firstly that labels are
   enough.  Or else, MRT will have negative effect on the deployment of
   normal service.  Besides this, the complexities for ASBR protection

   has been proposed by [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-mrt-frr-architecture].  It need
   further study.

4.5.  Partial Deployment

   For partial deployment and islands of compatible MRT FRR routers,
   proxy nodes and associated links are added to the network topology
   for MRT computation.  The difference between partial deployment and
   inter-area is that in the partial deployment scenario the border
   nodes need proxy egress process for LDP in the blue topology and the
   red topology.  That is, in the blue topology and red topology, the
   border node of the MRT network topology is not the actual egress for
   a prefix out of the MRT network.  The border node has to advertise
   label for the prefix as the proxy egress.

4.6.  LDP over TE

   There is also additional complexity for LDP over TE scenario in which
   nodes in the LDP domain need to calculate two different MRT FRR for
   different nodes in the MPLS TE domain: edge nodes which can support
   both LDP and TE and internal nodes which only supports TE.  Edges
   nodes combine with nodes in the LDP domain to form a complete
   topology for MRT FRR calculation.  Internal nodes don't support LDP,
   but are not hidden from IGP topology.  Some IP traffic to internal
   nodes which do not support LDP maybe need MRT FRR provided by nodes
   in the LDP domain.  Nodes in the LDP domain calculate MRT FRR for
   these internal nodes like partial deployment.  An example deployment
   is shown in the following figure.  LDP over TE is deployed in edge
   nodes B, C, E and H.  Internal nodes I, J and K do not support LDP.
   For MRT FRR, the deployment can be seen as two independent
   topologies.  For internal nodes I, J and K, as shown in the figure
   (b) it is similar as the process of partial deployment.  For other
   nodes, as shown in the figure (c) it is similar as the process of
   2-connected network and the bidirectional MPLS TE paths can be used
   as the virtual links in MRT computation.

4.7.  IP-Only Network

   In the IP-only network IP-in-IP has to be used.  This means
   additional loopback addresses have to be introduced.  And they are
   announced with associated MRT color.  It will propose complexities
   for operation and management of the network.  We recommend LDP MT
   should be deployed in the network for the fast-reroute usage to
   reduce the complexities.  It also will not introduce any complexity
   of IP MT forwarding in the ingress node since the multi-topology only
   takes effect for protection.  Comparing with tunnel IP packet in IP,
   LDP MT is an easy way to provision fast-reroute.

5.  Deployment Considerations

5.1.  IGP MT and LDP MT

   MRT computation can be seen as a local process for IGP if only the
   computation is consistent for all nodes of the network.  That is,
   multi-topology is not necessary for IGP to advertise link states with
   MT-ID.  MT-ID is only advertised in LDP for LDP's FEC usage.  That
   is, for MRT fast-reroute, IGP MT-ID can be independent of LDP MT-ID.
   But this proposes complexity for operation and management.  It seems
   desirable to keep the consistency of MT-IDs for both IGP and LDP.

   There exists another issue regarding the relationship of IGP and LDP.
   IGP does not support IPv4 and IPv6 in one topology.  When multi-
   topology is used for MRT fast-reroute, the blue topology and the red
   topology of IPv4 should be different from those of IPv6.  However,



Zhenbin Li, et al.      Expires October 28, 2013               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft     App of LDP MT for Unicast MRT FRR          April 2013


   for LDP, the address family is adopted for FEC in one multi-topology.
   Label distribution should be done for both IPv4 and IPv6 in one
   multi-topology.  If the MT-ID is consistent for IGP and LDP, there
   should be four MT-IDs for IPv4 and IPv6 in one MRT network.  For
   protocol extensions of MRT fast-reroute, both IPv4 and IPv6 should be
   taken into account for IGP to advertise information related with the
   blue topology and the red topology.

   Besides the inconsistency of IGP MT and LDP MT, there exists the
   inconsistency between the OSPF MT[RFC4915] and the IS-IS MT[RFC5120].
   Different MT-ID ranges for OSPF and IS-IS which cause the difficulty
   in reserving the same MRT MT-IDs for OSPF and IS-IS.

   When multi-topology is used for MRT fast-reroute, it is error-prone
   for MT-ID configuration for the blue topology and the red topology on
   all nodes of the MRT network.  In order to simplify operation and
   management, it is recommended that MT-IDs could be reserved for the
   MRT fast-reroute usage.  Owing to the inconsistency of OSPF MT and
   IS-IS MT and the inconsistency of IGP MT and LDP MT, it seems a
   little challenge to reserve these possible values.

5.2.  Simplified Provision

   It is necessary to configure many parameters related with MRT FRR and
   advertise these capabilities and information by
   IGP[I-D.li-rtgwg-igp-ext-mrt-frr].  It is concerned that the
   provision complexity will have negative effect on the utility of MRT
   FRR.

   There are two different things for the MRT FRR provision:

   The first thing is the capability information which can be supported
   by a MRT-FRR-enabled node.  The information can be directly derived
   without configuration.

   The second thing is what parameters should be agreed on by all nodes
   to compute an MRT island.

   For example, as to [I-D.li-rtgwg-igp-ext-mrt-frr], a node can
   advertise the supported different algorithms through IGP.  The
   supported algorithms are internal capability which is not necessary
   to configure.  After all nodes advertise the information, they should
   choose one specific algorithm to compute MRT FRR.  This has to be
   configured or all nodes should agree on a default value in advance.

   The second thing should be considered more in order to simplify MRT
   FRR provision.  In fact, LDP MT is just the method to simplify the
   MRT FRR provision comparing with the method that tunnels IP packet in



Zhenbin Li, et al.      Expires October 28, 2013               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft     App of LDP MT for Unicast MRT FRR          April 2013


   IP.  If the latter method is preferred, it will be more difficult to
   design IP address carefully for each node than that only blue and red
   MT IDs is chosen for all nodes in the former method.  There are few
   parameters for LDP-MT-based MRT FRR to be provisioned.  The key
   parameters is just MT IDs and the algorithm's related parameters.  As
   in the section 3.6, It is strongly recommended that the IGP and LDP
   MT IDs used for MRT FRR should be reserved.  It is also the preferred
   default value for MRT algorithms should be defined in the appropriate
   documents.  By this way a default profile for MRT FRR provision is
   determined which is composed of a set of default values.  This can
   simplify the MRT FRR provision greatly.  If it is not available, all
   nodes can agree on a internal default profile which is determined by
   the implementation and save configuration work for MRT FRR.  If new
   nodes add to the network which use different default MT ID values and
   algorithm-related parameters, it can be changed administratively.

5.3.  IGP Multi-process

   IGP multi-process is used to isolate different areas.  If an ip
   prefix is advertised in multiple processes, each process will
   calculate routes for the prefix and the shortest one will be chosen
   to install forwarding entry.  Each IGP process calculates routes of
   MRT FRR independently and has its own pair of MRT topology (blue MRT
   topology and red MRT topology.  Since the MRT paths maybe different
   in different process, one process' MRT next hop can not be used in
   another process for a specific prefix to avoid loop.  So the primary
   route and its MRT next hop must be chosen in the same process.  In
   order to achieve this object, there should be different blue MRT MT-
   IDs and red MRT MT-IDs for these processes.  If there are only one
   pair of MRT topology for multiple processes (i.e.  there is only one
   blue MRT MT-ID and one red MRT MT-ID), loop can happen for MRT FRR
   when each node chooses its primary next hop and the MRT routes in the
   same process for the multiple processes.

   An IGP multi-process deployment is shown in the above figure.  Node
   A, B and C are located in both processes: the left process L and the
   right process R.  The process L is a ring topology, including link1
   and link3.  And the process R is also a ring topology, including
   link2 and link4.  For the traffic from the Source to the Destination,
   assume that A chooses the shortest path dertermined by the process R
   and using link2 as the primary next hop and B chooses the shortest
   path determined by the process L and using link3 as the primary next
   hop.  Process L and process R calculate MRT topologies independently,
   but there is only one pair of MRT MT-IDs and the label distribution
   is the same for different processes, this will cause the following
   forwarding entries are installed:

   Node B: The shortest path is determined by process L.  The MRT path
   is calculated in the same process.  Assume that B calculates the blue
   MRT topology shown in the (b) and chooses link1 in the blue MRT
   topology as its secondary route.  Then there is following forwarding
   entries for node B:

               Default Topology       Blue Topology     Red Topology
    B  Transit     L/L  C                Lb/Lb A           Lr/Lr C
                    /Lb A                  /Lr C


   Node A: The shortest path is determined by process R.  The MRT path
   is calculated in the same process.  Assume that A calculates the blue
   MRT topology shown in the (c).  Then there is following forwarding
   entries for node A:

               Default Topology       Blue Topology     Red Topology
    A  Transit     L/L  B                Lb/Lb B           Lr/Lr F
                    /Lr F                  /Lr F


   According to above forwarding entries, if node C fails, the traffic
   will be sent by B to A with label Lb using the secondary route.  When
   A receives the traffic with label Lb, it will send the traffic to B
   using the forwarding entry for the blue topology.  Then loop happens
   for the traffic.

   The solution of the issue is to use different MRT MTs for different
   processes.  That is, different MRT topologies should be provisioned
   for different processes so that the different label distribution is
   done for the multiple processes.  This will guarante that when
   failure happens the switched traffic will be forwarded in the same
   process.  The following figure shows the solution for as to the above
   example:

   Following forwarding entries will be created for A and B.  We can see
   that if failure happens, the switched traffic is forwarded from A to
   B to E and the loop issue is avoided.

   Owing to the loop issue in the IGP multi-process scenario, it must be
   checked carefully for the reserved MT-IDs or the default profile
   described above for simplifying provision which will cause multiple
   processes share the same MRT MT-IDs.  In order to prevent loop issue,
   separate MRT MTs for IGP multi-process have to be taken into account.

5.4.  Multiple IGP

   If multiple IGPs deploy in one network, the best route will be
   determined according to priority of these IGPs.  This might cause the
   inconsistency issue for MRT fast-reroute.  For example, when IS-IS
   and OSPF are deployed in one network, some nodes will use the best
   reroute computed by ISIS and some nodes will use the best route
   computed by OSPF.  If the link state is not consistent in IS-IS and
   OSPF, the MRT fast-reroute cannot work well.  It is highly desirable
   that in one network only one IGP protocol is deployed and link states
   should be guaranteed consistent if multiple IGPs deploys.

5.5.  Label Space

   Advantages of LDP MT in MRT fast-reroute are apparent for simplified
   operation and management comparing with using IP tunnel.  The main
   issue of LDP MT for MRT fast-reroute is resource occupancy.  MRT FRR
   need create two redundant topologies to provide backup path.  The two
   topologies cover all links and nodes of the MRT network.  It will
   impact on the system resource occupancy since it will also take more
   resource to install routes and label forwarding entries for different
   topologies.  When deploying LDP MT for MRT FRR, especially in the
   scenario of upgrading, consideration should be taken so that there is
   enough system resource to accommodate more routes and forwarding
   entries.  Besides the issue related with resource occupancy, label
   usage is also an important issue to be taken into account.  For one
   FEC, there are at least three label bindings distributed by one
   router.  The number of labels for MRT fast-route is triple of that of
   the network without MRT fast-reroute.  When LDP MT for MRT FRR is
   deployed, it should be guaranteed that enough labels are available so
   that it will not have impact on normal services such as L2VPN, L3VPN,
   etc.

5.6.  Proxy Egress

   In several scenarios where MRT FRR is deployed, proxy egress LSPs
   have to be setup by LDP.  The proxy egress LSP maybe not end-to-end
   to bear VPN service in the network.  But it will deteriorate label
   usage if LDP MT is deployed for MRT FRR.  It is highly desirable that
   such unnecessary LSPs should be prohibited to setup to facilitate MRT
   FRR deployment.

5.7.  Policy Control

   Policy can be used to reducing the effect of more labels for MRT FRR.
   It is important to control on the setup of LSP in the default
   topology.  There are two basic scenarios.  The first one is the IP-
   only network.  It is difficult to control the number of LSPs for
   protection since LDP MT is an extension for IP to implement
   protection.  The second one is the multi-service network based on
   VPN.  Policy can be applied to permit only host addresses to setup
   LSPs.

   Policy is not recommended to control on LSP in the blue topology and
   the red topology since it is easy to cause inconsistency of the
   protection.  For example, if one node need to set up MRT backup LSP
   for one FEC but this FEC is not allowed creating LSP by the policy in
   the MRT topologies, then the node cannot create the MRT backup LSP.

5.8.  Resource Allocations

   During the deployment of this solution, more system resource and
   extra label occupancy must be taken into account to avoid the
   possible resource exhausting.

5.9.  LDP DOD

   LDP DoD is used in some scenarios such as Seamless
   MPLS[I-D.ietf-mpls-seamless-mpls].  When MRT fast-reroute is
   deployed, label request will be sent according to the path calculated
   for different topology.  The label forwarding entry will be created
   as the method above.  Comparing with LDP DU, there are less label
   binding distribution for LDP DoD.  In addition, LDP DoD is always
   used combing with conservative label retention mode.  Thus there is
   no label binding distributed for the secondary route calculated in
   the default topology so that LFA cannot not be used easily.  The
   label forwarding entry in the blue topology or the red topology will
   be used as the secondary one directly.
