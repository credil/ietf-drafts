    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes how to use a subset of the IETF-based emergency call framework for
        accomplishing emergency calling support in vehicles. Simplifications are possible due to the
        nature of the functionality that is going to be provided in vehicles with the usage of GPS.
        Additionally, further profiling needs to be done regarding the encoding of location
        information.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>Emergency calls made from vehicles can assist with the objective of significantly reducing
        road deaths and injuries. Unfortunately, drivers often have a poor location-awareness,
        especially on urban roads (also during night) and abroad. In the most crucial cases, the
        victim(s) may not be able to call because they have been injured or trapped.</t>

      <t>In Europe the European Commission has launched the eCall initiative that may best be
        described as a user initiated or automatically triggered system to provide notifications to
        Public Safety Answering Point's (PSAP), by means of cellular communications, that a vehicle
        has crashed, and to provide geodetic location information and where possible a voice channel
        to the PSAP. At the time of writing the suppor for eCall are focused on legacy technology.
         This document details how emergency calls triggered by vehicles can be accomplished in an Internet Protocol-based environment. </t>

      <t>This document is organized as follows: <xref target="terminology"/> defines the
        terminology, <xref target="data-profile"/> describes how the required functionality can be accomplished by combining several already existing standards, and <xref target="example"/> shows an example message exchange.
        This document concludes with the security considerations in <xref target="security"/> and
        IANA considerations in <xref target="iana"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
        "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
          <xref target="RFC2119"/>. </t>
      <t>This document re-uses terminology defined in Section 3 of <xref
          target="RFC5012"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="data-profile" title="Profile">
      <t>In the context of emergncy calls placed from a vehicle it is assumed that the car is equipped with a built-in GPS receiver. 
	  For this reason only geodetic location information will
        be sent within an emergency call. The following location shapes MUST be implemented: 2d and 3d Point (see
        Section 5.2.1 of <xref target="RFC5491"/>), Circle (see Section
        5.2.3 of <xref target="RFC5491"/>), and Ellipsoid (see Section
        5.2.7 of <xref target="RFC5491"/>). The coordinate reference
        systems (CRS) specified in <xref target="RFC5491"/> are also
        mandatory for this document. The &lt;direction&gt; element, as defined in <xref target="RFC5962"/> which indicates the direction of travel of the vehicle, is
        important for dispatch and hence it MUST be included in the PIDF-LO . The
        &lt;heading&gt; element specified in <xref
          target="RFC5962"/> MUST be implemented and MAY be included. </t>
		  
	<t>This specification also inherits the test call functionality from Section 15 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="example" title="Example">
      <t>
        <xref target="fig1"/> shows an emergency call placed from a vehicle whereby location
        information information is directly attached to the SIP INVITE message itself. The call is
        marked as an emergency call using the 'urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic' service URN and the PSAP of the
        VoIP provider determines which PSAP to contact based on the provided location information.
        The emergency
        call continues towards the PSAP and in this example it hits the ESRP, as the entry point to
        the PSAP operators emergency services network. Finally, the emergency call will be received
        by a call taker and first reponders will be dispatched. </t>
