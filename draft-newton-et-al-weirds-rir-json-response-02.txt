Internet-Draft         RIR RESTful JSON RESPONSES              July 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) have begun experimenting with
   RESTful web services for access to Whois data.  RIR-QUERY
   [I-D.newton-et-al-weirds-rir-query] presents uniform patterns which
   may be used to contruct URLs for accessing data from these RESTful
   web services.  This document describes responses in the JSON
   [RFC4627] serialization format to the query URLs in RIR-QUERY.

   As this document describes responses returned in JSON [RFC4627]
   format, other documents may describe responses in other formats to
   the same URL queries.

2.  Congruence With Other Registry Data Access Protocols

   This document describes the URL patterns for a Number Resource
   Registry Data Access Protocol (NRRD-AP) and describes a Registry Data
   Access Protocol (RD-AP) adhering to
   [I-D.designteam-weirds-using-http], the intent being a specification
   for number resource registries useful and in the style similar to
   other registry access protocols, such as Domain Name Registry Access
   Protocols (DNRP-AP).

   Of specific note, the signalling for JSON, JSON naming scheme, and
   normalized references to other specifications are documented in
   [I-D.designteam-weirds-using-http].

   With specific regards to JSON format signalling, this document
   defines and registers the media type "application/nrrdap+json", and
   conformance to this specification is level 0.  The JSON value for to
   be used within the rdapConformance array is "nrrdap_level_0".

Internet-Draft         RIR RESTful JSON RESPONSES              July 2012


3.  Responses

   As specified in RIR-QUERY [I-D.newton-et-al-weirds-rir-query],
   queries for resources and information can be made for three types of
   information: 1) information about IP networks, 2) information about
   autonomous system numbers, and 3) information about reverse DNS
   delegations.  Queries for each of these three types can be
   constructed to target specific information:

   o  operator information (e.g. "/operator")

   o  contacts of the operator (e.g "/operator/contacts")

   o  specific types of contacts of the operator (e.g. "/operator/
      contacts/abuse")

   o  registration information about the networks, AS numbers, or DNS
      delegations (e.g. "/registration")

   o  all of the above (e.g. "/")

   Unless otherwise stated, data types of the values listed in this
   section are referenced in [I-D.designteam-weirds-using-http].

3.1.  IP Networks

   The following is an elided example of a JSON [RFC4627] response
   object to a query for both registration and operator information of
   an IP network


   {
     "network":
     {
       ...
     },
     "operator":
     {
       ...
     }
   }


                                 Figure 1

   The "network" member, which may be queried for directly as the
   registration information (i.e. "/registration") of the IP network is
   described below.

   The following is an example of the JSON object for the network
   registration information


   {
     "handle" : "XXXX-RIR",
     "startAddress" : "10.0.0.0",
     "endAddress" : "10.0.0.255",
     "ipVersion" : 4,
     "name": "NET-RTR-1",
     "description" : [ "A network used for routing" ],
     "type" : "DIRECT ALLOCATION",
     "country" : "AU",
     "parentHandle" : "YYYY-RIR",
     "remarks" : [
       "she sells seas shells",
       "down by the seashore"
     ],
     "uris" : [
       {
         "type" : "source",
         "uri" : "http://whois-rws.net/network/xxxx"
       },
       {
         "type" : "parent",
         "uri" : "http://whois-rws.net/network/yyyy"
       },
       {
         "type" : "held",
         "uri" : "http://example.net/location/xxxx"
       }
     ],
     "registrationDate" : "20110509",
     "lastChangedDate" : "20110509",
     "lastChangedBy" : "joe@bob.com"
   }


   The following is a description of the members of this object:

   handle  -- a string representing an RIR unique identifier of the
      network registration

   startAddress  -- the starting IP address of the network, either IPv4
      or IPv6

Internet-Draft         RIR RESTful JSON RESPONSES              July 2012


   endAddress  -- the ending IP address of the network, either IPv4 or
      IPv6

   ipVersion  -- an integer signifying the IP protocol version of the
      network: 4 signifying an IPv4 network, 6 signifing an IPv6 network

   name  -- an identifier assigned to the network registration by the
      registration holder

   description  -- an array of strings containing descriptive text about
      the network registration

   type  -- a string containing an RIR specific classification of the
      network

   country  -- a string containing the name of the 2 character country
      code of the network

   parentHandle  -- a string containing an RIR unique identifier of the
      parent network of this network registration

   The members "remarks", "uris", "registrationDate", "lastChangedDate",
   and "lastChangedBy" take the same form of the members of the same
   name of the entity object (Section 4).

   The "operator" member of Figure 1, which maybe queried for directly
   using the "/operator" path, is described below.

Internet-Draft         RIR RESTful JSON RESPONSES              July 2012


   The following is an elided example of a JSON response object for
   operator information


   {
     "entity":
     {
       ...
     },
     "contacts":
     {
       "tech": [
         ...
       ],
       "admin": [
         ...
       ],
       "abuse": [
         ...
       ]
     }
   }


                                 Figure 2

   The "entity" member of Figure 2 is an object and is specified in
   Section 4.  The "contacts" member is an object containing three
   arrays: "tech", "admin", and "abuse".  Each of these arrays contains
   entities (Section 4).  That is, the "tech" array contains entity
   objects, each representing a tech contact, etc...

3.2.  Autonomous Systems

   An autonomous number query for both the registration and operator
   and/or contact information yields an object containing an "autnum"
   member and an "operator" member.  The "operator" member is as
   specified in Section 3.1.  Additionally, queries specifically for the
   operator and/or contact information take the same form as in
   Section 3.1.

   The "autnum" member mentioned above as well as queries directly for
   the registration information take the form of a JSON [RFC4627]
   object.

   The following is an example of a JSON object representing an autnum.


   {
     "handle" : "XXXX-RIR",
     "startAutnum" : "10",
     "endAutnum" : "15",
     "name": "AS-RTR-1",
     "description" : [ "AS for Exchange" ],
     "type" : "DIRECT ALLOCATION",
     "country": "AU",
     "remarks" : [
       "she sells seas shells",
       "down by the seashore"
     ],
     "uris" : [
       {
         "type" : "source",
         "uri" : "http://whois-rws.net/autnum/xxxx"
       },
       {
         "type" : "parent",
         "uri" : "http://whois-rws.net/autnum/yyyy"
       },
       {
         "type" : "held",
         "uri" : "http://example.net/location/xxxx"
       }
     ],
     "registrationDate" : "20110509",
     "lastChangedDate" : "20110509",
     "lastChangedBy" : "joe@bob.com"
   }


   The following is a description of the members of this object:

   handle  -- a string representing an RIR unique identifier of the
      autnum registration

   startAutnum  -- the starting number [RFC5396] in the block of
      autonomous system numbers

   name  an identifier assigned to the autnum registration by the
      registration holder

   description  -- an array of strings containing descriptive text about
      the autnum registration

   type  -- a string containing an RIR specific classification of the
      autnum

   country  -- a string containing the name of the 2 character country
      code of the autnum

   The members "remarks", "uris", "registrationDate", "lastChangedDate",
   and "lastChangedBy" take the same form of the members of the same
   name of the entity object (Section 4).

3.3.  Reverse DNS

   A reverse DNS delegation query for both the registration and operator
   and/or contact information yields an object containing an "rdns"
   member and an "operator" member.  The "operator" member is as
   specified in Section 3.1.  Additionally, queries specifically for the
   operator and/or contact information take the same form as in
   Section 3.1.

   The "rdns" member mentioned above as well as queries directly for the
   reverse DNS information take the form of a JSON [RFC4627] object.

4.  The Entity Object

   Throughout this document there is a need to represent the identity
   and contact information of organizations, corporations, governments,
   non-profits, clubs, individual persons, and informal groups of
   people.  All of these representations are so similar that it is best
   to represent them in JSON [RFC4627] with one construct, the entity
   object, to aid in the re-use of code by implementers.

   The following is an example of an entity:


       {
         "handle" : "XXXX-RIR",
         "names": [ "Joe Bob, Inc.", "Bobby Joe Shopping" ],
         "postalAddress" : [
           "123 Maple Ave",
           "Suite 90001",
           "Vancouver",
           "BC",
           "12393"
         ],
         "emails" : [ "joe@bob.com", "bob@joe.com" ],
         "phones" : {

           "fax" : [ "222-222-222-22" ],
           "mobile" : [ "333-333-333-33" ]
         },
         "remarks" : [
           "she sells seas shells",
           "down by the seashore"
         ],
