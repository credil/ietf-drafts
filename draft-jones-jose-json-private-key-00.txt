Internet-Draft       JWS JSON Serialization (JWS-JS)         August 2012


1.  Introduction

   The JSON Private Key specification extends the JSON Web Key (JWK)
   [JWK] and JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA] specifications to define a
   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC4627] representation of private
   keys.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in Key words for use in
   RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the same terminology as the JSON Web Key
   (JWK) [JWK] and JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA] specifications.


3.  JWK Parameters for Private Keys

   This section defines additional JSON Web Key parameters that enable
   JWKs to represent private keys.

3.1.  JWK Parameters for Elliptic Curve Private Keys

   When the JWK "alg" member value is "EC", the following member MAY be
   used to represent an Elliptic Curve private key:

3.1.1.  "d" (ECC Private Key) Parameter

   The "d" (ECC private key) member contains the Elliptic Curve private
   key value.  It is represented as the base64url encoding of the
   value's unsigned big endian representation as a byte array.  The
   array representation MUST not be shortened to omit any leading zero
   bytes.  For instance, when representing 521 bit integers, the byte
   array to be base64url encoded MUST contain 66 bytes, including any
   leading zero bytes.

3.2.  JWK Parameters for RSA Private Keys

   When the JWK "alg" member value is "RSA", the following member MAY be
   used to represent an RSA private key:

3.2.1.  "pri" (Private Exponent) Parameter

   The "pri" (private exponent) member contains the private exponent
   value for the RSA private key.  It is represented as the base64url
   encoding of the value's unsigned big endian representation as a byte
   array.  The array representation MUST not be shortened to omit any
   leading zero bytes.  For instance, when representing 2048 bit
   integers, the byte array to be base64url encoded MUST contain 256
   bytes, including any leading zero bytes.


4.  Example Private Keys

   The following example JWK Set contains two keys represented as JWKs
   containing both public and private key values: one using an Elliptic
   Curve algorithm and a second one using an RSA algorithm.  This
   example extends the example in Section 3 of [JWK], adding private key
   values.  (Line breaks are for display purposes only.)

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  JSON Web Key Parameters Registration

   This specification registers the parameter names defined in
   Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 in the IANA JSON Web Key Parameters
   registry [JWK].

5.1.1.  Registry Contents

   o  Parameter Name: "d"

   o  Change Controller: IETF

   o  Specification Document(s): Section 3.1.1 of [[ this document ]]

   o  Parameter Name: "pri"

   o  Change Controller: IETF

   o  Specification Document(s): Section 3.2.1 of [[ this document ]]


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for this specification are the same as
   those for the JSON Web Key (JWK) [JWK] specification and the portion
   of the JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA] specification that pertains to
   key representations.

   o  Created draft-jones-jose-json-private-key to facilitate discussion
      of the question from the W3C WebCrypto WG to the IETF JOSE WG of
      whether JOSE plans to support a format for representing private
      keys.
