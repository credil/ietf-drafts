    <section title="Recap: Incremental Deployment Features of the ConEx Protocol">
      <t>The ConEx mechanism document <xref
      target="conex-abstract-mech"></xref> goes to great lengths to design for
      incremental deployment in all the respects below. It should be referred
      to for precise details on each of these points:<list style="symbols">
          <t>The ConEx mechanism is essentially a change to the source, in
          order to re-insert congestion feedback into the network.</t>

          <t>Source-host-only deployment is possible without any negotiation
          required, and individual transport protocol implementations within a
          source host can be updated separately.</t>

          <t>Receiver modification may optionally improve ConEx for some
          transport protocols with feedback limitations (TCP being the main
          example), but it is not a necessity</t>

          <t>Proxies for the source and/or receiver are feasible (though not
          necessarily straightforward)</t>

          <t>Queues and network forwarding do not require any modification for
          ConEx.</t>

          <t>ECN is not required in the network for ConEx. If some network
          nodes support ECN, it can be used by ConEx.</t>

          <t>ECN is not required at the receiver for ConEx. The sender should
          nonetheless attempt to negotiate ECN-usage with the receiver, given
          some aspects of ConEx work better the more ECN is deployed,
          particularly auditing and border measurement.</t>

          <t>Given ConEx exposes information for IP-layer policy devices to
          use, the design does not preclude possible innovative uses of ConEx
          information by other IP-layer devices, e.g. forwarding itself</t>

          <t>Packets indicate whether or not they support ConEx.</t>

      <section title="Recap of Basic ConEx Components">
        <t><xref target="conex-abstract-mech"></xref> introduces the following
        components:<list style="symbols">
            <t>The ConEx Wire Protocol (currently only specified for IPv6
            <xref target="conex-destopt"></xref>, although a possible way to
            fit ConEx into the IPv4 header has been described <xref
            target="intarea-ipv4-id-reuse"></xref>)</t>

            <t>Receiver (optionally modified)</t>

            <t>Audit</t>

            <t>Policy Devices:<list style="symbols">
                <t>Rest-of-Path Congestion Monitoring Devices (using
                information from the ConEx wire protocol)</t>

                <t>Congestion Policers (using rest-of-path congestion
                monitoring)</t>
              </list></t>
          </list><xref target="conex-abstract-mech"></xref> should be referred
        to for definitions of each of these components and further
        explanation.</t>

        <t>The goal of all these ConEx elements for this scenario is to expose
        information about congestion on the whole-path to a
        congestion-policer. A congestion-policer is nearly identical to a
        traditional token-bucket-based bit-rate policer except the tokens it
        fills with arrive at a rate that represents the volume of congestion
        that the customer is allowed to contribute to over time and tokens
        drain from the bucket at a rate dependent on the ConEx signals
        representing rest-of-path congestion. <xref target="CongPol"></xref>
        introduces congestion-policing and <xref
        target="conex-concepts-uses"></xref> explains the benefits of policing
        based on congestion-volume compared to methods like weighted
        round-robin traditionally used in a BRAS.</t>

               title="Per-Network Deployment Concepts">
        <t>Network deployment-related definitions:<list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Internet Ingress:">The first IP node a packet
            traverses that is outside the source's own network. In a
            residential access network scenario, for traffic from a home this
            is the first IP-aware node after the home access equipment. For
            Internet access from an enterprise network this is the provider
            edge router.</t>

            <t hangText="Internet Egress:">The last IP node a packet traverses
            before reaching the receiver's network.</t>

            <t hangText="ConEx-Enabled Network:">A network whose edge nodes
            implement ConEx policy functions.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Each network can unilaterally choose to use any ConEx information
        given by those sources using ConEx, independently of whether other
        networks use it.</t>

        <t>Typically, a network will use ConEx information by deploying a
        policy function at the ingress edge of its network to monitor arriving
        traffic and to act in some way on the congestion information in those
        packets that are ConEx-enabled. Actions might include policing,
        altering the class of service, or re-routing. Alternatively, less
        direct actions via a management system might include triggering
        capacity upgrades, triggering penalty clauses in contracts or levying
        charges between networks based on ConEx measurements.</t>

        <t>Typically, a network using ConEx info will deploy a ConEx policy
        function near the ingress edge and a ConEx audit function near the
        egress edge. The segment of the path between a ConEx policy function
        and a ConEx audit function can be considered to be a ConEx-protected
        segment of the path. Assuming a network covers all its ingresses and
        egresses with policy functions and audit functions respectively, the
        network within this ring will be a ConEx-protected network.</t>

        <t>Of course, because each edge device usually serves as both an
        ingress and an egress, the two functions are both likely to be present
        in each edge device.</t>

             title="Example Initial Deployment Arrangements">
      <t>In all the deployment scenarios below, we assume that deployment
      starts with some data sources being modified with ConEx code. The
      rationale for this is that the developer of a scavenger transport
      protocol like LEDBAT has a strong incentive to tell the network how
      little congestion it is causing despite sending large volumes of data.
      In this case the developer makes the first move expecting it will prompt
      at least some networks to move in response&mdash;so that they use the
      ConEx information to reward users of the scavenger protocol.</t>

        <t>The name 'Receiving Network' for this scenario merely emphasises
        that most data is arriving from connected networks and data centres
        and being consumed by residential customers on this access network.
        Some data is of course also travelling in the other direction.</t>

        <t>Figure <xref target="Fig_1RNet_Scenario"></xref> is an attempt to
        show the salient features of a ConEx deployment in a typical broadband
        access provider's network (within the constraints of ASCII art).
        Broadband remote access servers (BRASs) control access to the core
        network from the access network and vice versa. Home networks (and
        small businesses) connect to the access network, but only two are
        shown.</t>

        <t>In this diagram, all data is travelling towards the access network
        of Home-b, from the Peer network, the Data centre, the CDN and Home-a.
        Data actually travels in both directions on all links, but only one
        direction is shown.</t>

        <t>The data centre, core and access network are all run by the same
        network operator, but each is the responsibility of a different
        department with internal accounting between them. The content
        distribution network (CDN) is operated by a third party CDN provider,
        and of course the peer network is also operated by a third party.</t>

        <t>This operator of the data centre, core and access network is the
        only one in the diagram to have deployed ConEx monitoring and policy
        devices at the edges of its network. However, it has not enabled ECN
        on any of its network elements and neither has any other network in
        the diagram. The operator has deployed a congestion policing function
        (P) on the provider-edge router where the peer attaches to its core,
        on the BRAS where the CDN attaches and on the other BRAS where each of
        the residential customers like Home-a attach. On the provider-edge
        router where the data centre attaches it has deployed a congestion
        monitoring function (M). Each of these policing and monitoring
        functions handles the aggregate of all traffic traversing it, for all
        destinations.</t>

        <t>The operator has deployed an audit function on each logical output
        port of the BRAS for each end-customer site like Home-b. The Audit
        function handles the aggregate of all traffic for that end-customer
        from all sources. For traffic in the opposite direction (e.g. from
        Home-b to Home-a, there would be equivalent policing (P) and audit (A)
        functions in the converse locations to those shown.</t>

        <t>Some content sources in the CDN and in the data centre are using
        the ConEx protocol, but others are not. There is a similar situation
        for hosts attached to the Peer network and hosts in home networks like
        Home-a: some are sending ConEx packets at least for bulk data
        transports, while others are not.</t>

        <section title="ConEx Functions in the Single Receiving Network Scenario">
          <t>Within the BRAS there are logical ports that model the rate of
          each access line from the DSLAM to each home network <xref
          target="TR-059"></xref>, <xref target="TR-101"></xref>. They are fed
          by a shared queue that models the rate of the downstream link from
          the BRAS to the DSLAM (sometimes called the backhaul network). If
          there is congestion anywhere in the set of networks in Figure <xref
          target="Fig_1RNet_Scenario"></xref> it is nearly always:<list
              style="symbols">
              <t>either self-congestion in the queues into the logical ports
              representing the access lines</t>

              <t>or shared congestion in the shared queue on the BRAS that
              feeds them.</t>
            </list>Any ConEx sources sending data through this BRAS will
          receive feedback about these losses from the destination and
          re-insert it as ConEx markings into the data. <xref
          target="Fig_Ex_Plot_Loss"></xref> shows an example plot of the loss
          levels that might be seen at different monitoring points along a
          path between the data centre and home-b, for instance. The top half
          of the figure shows the loss probability within the BRAS consists of
          0.1% at the shared queue and 0.2% self-congestion in the logical
          output port that models the access line, making 0.3% in total. This
          upper diagram also shows whole path congestion as signalled by the
          ConEx sender, which remains unchanged along the whole path at
          0.3%.</t>

          <t>The lower half of the figure shows (downstream congestion) =
          (whole path) - (upstream congestion). Upstream congestion can only
          be monitored locally where the loss actually happens (within the
          BRAS output queues). Nonetheless, given there is rarely loss
          anywhere else but within the BRAS, this limitation is not
          significant in this scenario. The lower half of the figure also
          shows the location of the policing and audit functions. Policing
          anywhere within or upstream ofthe BRAS will be based on the
          downstream congestion level of 0.3%. While Auditing within the BRAS
          but after all the queues can check that the whole path congestion
          signalled by ConEx is no less than the loss levels experienced
          within the BRAS itself.</t>

        <section title="Incentives to Unilaterally Deploy ConEx in a Receiving Network">
          <t>Even a sending application that is modified to use ConEx can
          choose whether to send ConEx or Not-ConEx packets. Nonetheless,
          ConEx packets bring information to a policer about congestion
          expected on the rest of the path beyond the policer. Not-ConEx
          packets bring no such information. Therefore a network that has
          deployed ConEx policers will tend to rate-limit not-ConEx packets
          conservatively in order to manage the unknown risk of congestion. In
          contrast, a network doesn't normally need to rate-limit
          ConEx-enabled packets unless they reveal a persistently high
          contribution to congestion. This natural tendency for networks to
          favour senders that provide ConEx information encourages senders to
          choose to use the ConEx protocol whenever they can.</t>

          <t>In particular, high volume sources have the most incentive to
          deploy ConEx. This is because high volume sources (e.g. video
          download sites or peer-to-peer file-sharing) can gain by
          implementing a low 'weight' end-to-end transport (i.e. a less
          aggressive response to congestion than other transports). Then,
          although they send a large amount of volume, they need not
          contribute significantly to congestion. If the ISP currently limits
          data volume, or offers chargeable tiers based on data volume, such
          customers stand to gain considerably if they can encourage the ISP
          to limit usage based on congestion-volume instead of volume. </t>

          <t><xref target="idepl_Fig_weighted"></xref> explains why this is
          the case. The plots show bit-rate on the vertical axis and time
          horizontally. A file transfer (e.g. the one labelled from customer
          'b') is given a simplified representation as a rectangle, implying
          it runs at a set rate for a time, then completes. The maximum height
          of each plot represents the maximum capacity of the shared link
          across the backhaul network, which is typically the bottleneck in a
          broadband network. The hatched regions represent unused capacity.
          'c' represents the high volume source that we intend to show has an
          incentive to deploy ConEx.</t>

          <t>In the upper half of the figure, customers 'b' &amp; 'c' both use
          transports with equal weights, which is why they are shown with
          equal rates when they both compete for the capacity of the line. 'c'
          sends larger files than 'b', so when 'b' completes each of its file,
          'c' can use the full capacity of the line until 'b' starts the next
          file. In the lower half of the figure, 'c' uses a less aggressive
          (lower weight) transport, so whenever 'b' sends a file, 'c' yields
          more of its rate. This allows 'b' to complete its transfer earlier,
          so that 'c' can take up the full rate earlier. 'b' sends the same
          volume files (same area in the graph), just faster and therefore
          they complete sooner (tall &amp; thin instead of shorter and wider).
          As a result, 'c' hardly finishes any later than in the upper
          diagram. However, 'c' will have contributed much less to congestion,
          and 'b' completes the majority of its file transfers much faster.
          'b' has also contributed less to congestion.</t>

          <t>As we have said, customer 'c' in particular stands to gain if the
          ISP bases usage-limits (or usage charges) on congestion-volume
          rather than volume. The ISP also has a strong incentive to reward
          customers like 'c', because they make the network performance appear
          far better than before for customer's like 'b' (e.g. short Web
          transfers). However, the network cannot make this move until
          customers like 'c' expose congestion information (ConEx) that the
          ISP can use in its traffic management or contracts.</t>

          <t>Of course, in reality there would be more than two customers. But
          this would mean that short transfers like 'b' stand to gain even
          more, as multiple larger files would be yielding at once.</t>

          <t>We should point out that not all high-volume customers will be
          prepared to temporarily shift their usage out of the way as shown
          &mdash; real-time video for instance would still use a higher weight
          (more aggressive) so as to ensure timely delivery. However, high
          volume applications with elastic (non-real-time) requirements are
          also common (e.g. video streaming, software downloads, etc)</t>

          <t>We should also point out that a transport that is less agressive
          against other customers is similar but not quite the same as LEDBAT
          <xref target="ledbat-congestion"></xref>. LEDBAT does indeed yield
          more to other flows during congestion, but it is designed to only do
          this if the contention for resources is at a slow link, such as the
          customer's own home router. If the contention is at a fast link,
          such as a BRAS, LEDBAT is designed not to yield. This is because
          ISPs currently give no reward to a transport that minimises
          congestion to others &mdash; because they do not have the congestion
          information to be able to.</t>

    <section title="Conclusions">
      <t>This document has introduced how congestion policing could be
      deployed at the broadband remote access servers in a typical broadband
      access network. Congestion policing uses ConEx markings introduced by
      data sources and packets discarded by the BRAS to determine rest-of-path
      congestion, and police traffic accordingly. </t>

      <t>It has been shown that high-volume elastic data sources have a strong
      incentive to deploy ConEx speculatively in the expectation that they
      will be able to encourage their ISPs to account for their usage by
      congestion-volume, not volume. They can use a less aggressive transport
      and prove that they are contributing little to congestion despite
      sending a lot of volume. ISPs also have a strong incentive to use this
      ConEx information to encourage their elastic high-volume customers to
      use less agressive transports, given they improve the performance of all
      the other customers. </t>

      <t>Without ConEx information, ISPs can only use volume as a metric of
      usage, which prevents the above virtuous circle from forming, perversely
      discouraging high-volume elastic customers from such friendly
      behaviour.</t>

            <t>This document provides the entry point to the set of
            documentation about the Congestion Exposure (ConEx) protocol. It
            explains the motivation for including a ConEx marking at the IP
            layer: to expose information about congestion to network nodes.
            Although such information may have a number of uses, this document
            focuses on how the information communicated by the ConEx marking
            can serve as the basis for significantly more efficient and
            effective traffic management than what exists on the Internet
            today.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>This specification takes a new approach to extensibility that
            is both principled and a hack. It builds on recent moves to
            formalise the increasingly common practice where fragmentation in
            IPv4 more closely matches that of IPv6. The large majority of IPv4
            packets are now 'atomic', meaning indivisible. In such packets,
            the 16 bits of the IPv4 Identification (IPv4 ID) field are
            redundant and could be freed up for the Internet community to put
            to other uses, at least within the constraints imposed by their
            original use for reassembly. This specification defines the
            process for redefining the semantics of these bits. It uses the
            previously reserved control flag in the IPv4 header to indicate
            that these 16 bits have new semantics. Great care is taken
            throughout to ease incremental deployment, even in the presence of
            middleboxes that incorrectly discard or normalise packets that
            have the reserved control flag set.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>LEDBAT is an experimental delay-based congestion control
            algorithm that attempts to utilize the available bandwidth on an
            end-to-end path while limiting the consequent increase in queueing
            delay on the path. LEDBAT uses changes in one-way delay
            measurements to limit congestion that the flow itself induces in
            the network. LEDBAT is designed for use by background
            bulk-transfer applications; it is designed to be no more
            aggressive than TCP congestion control and to yield in the
            presence of any competing flows when latency builds, thus limiting
            interference with the network performance of the competing
            flows.</t>
