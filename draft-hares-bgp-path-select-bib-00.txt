     Abstract 

        BGP-v4?s [RFC4271]path selection rule has been enforce since the 
        1990s. The Inter-Domain Working Group [IDR] will be considering 
        additions to the path selection [add-path][add-path-guidelines][path-
        select-criteria] in 2011-2012. 

        This document provides a bibliography of publications (research and 
        public) regarding the bgp path selection.

     Internet-Draft     BGP Path Selection Bibliography           2011-10-23 
         

     1. Introduction 

        The IDR working group [IDR-WG] has several suggestion alternations to 
        the BGP route selection process [add-paths][add-path-guidlines][best-
        path-select][aigp] 

        BGP-4?s current path selection has been encoded in routers for 20+ 
        years and incorporates bgp update reception, bgp policy, and 
        convergence characteristics.  

        Any BGP-4?s current path selection requires careful consideration of 
        all the accumulated wisdom from academic research, industry research, 
        deployment investigations, and algorithm examinations. This document 
        seeks to provide a bibliography of this work that examines BGP basic 
        functions, performance, and suggested solutions.   

        Version-00 of this document is only a beginning of collecting these 
        resources.

                 routes received from Peer.

     8. Conclusion and Recommendation 

        The literature on BGP points toward the complexity of many of these 
        solutions, and the far ranging impact. The considerations of these 
        new BGP algorithms   

     9. Manageability Considerations 

        This document does not add additional manageability considerations.  

     10. Security Considerations 

        This document as a document review has no security considerations. 
        Perhaps because BGP algorithms have little security considerations.  

     11. IANA Considerations
