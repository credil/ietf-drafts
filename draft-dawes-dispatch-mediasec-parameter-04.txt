Abstract

   Negotiating the security mechanisms used between a Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) user agent and its next-hop SIP entity is already
   described in an RFC.  This document extends negotiation of a security
   mechanism to the media plane by defining a new Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) header field parameter to label security mechanisms
   that apply to the media plane.

Internet-Draft          Media Security Parameter             August 2011


1.  Introduction

   RFC 3329 [4] describes negotiation of a security mechanism for SIP
   signalling between a UAC and its first hop proxy.  This document
   extends the concept of security negotiation by adding exchange of
   security capability for the media plane.  Similar to the signalling
   plane, the evolution of security mechanisms for media often
   introduces new algorithms, or uncovers problems in existing ones,
   making negotiation of mechanisms a necessity.

   The purpose of this specification is to define negotiation
   functionality for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [1].  This
   negotiation is intended to work only between a UA and its first-hop
   SIP entity.

1.1.  Motivations

1.1.1.  Access Network Protection

   Some access technologies protect the data passed over them by
   default, for example many cellular wireless accesses, but some do
   not, for example WLAN.  For accesses with no protection, it is useful
   for the media controlled by SIP signalling to be protected by default
   because of vulnerability to eavesdropping.  It is currently possible
   for a UA to request protection of the media plane end-to-end by
   including the crypto attribute in SDP at session setup.  This does
   not guarantee protection however, because it relies on support of
   encryption by the called UA, or by another entity in the path taken
   by the media.  In some cases, the session will originate in an access
   that protects the media and terminate in one that does not, meaning
   that media is protected in all but some hops of its path.  In cases
   where the same provider supplies the user equipment and provides the
   IP access, the IP access technology that the UA will use is
   predictable and the media is vulnerable only as far as the core
   network.  In such cases, the user equipment it is possible to protect
   the media plane by encrypting at the UA and decrypting at the edge of
   the core network, and for the user agent that originates or
   terminates the session to expect the edge of the core network to be
   capable of encrypting and decrypting media.  This document describes
   this case of first-hop protection, which is typically provided by
   default to a user agent.  Both media and signalling must pass through
   the entity at the edge of the core network, which must therefore be a
   back-to-back user agent (B2BUA).

   End to access edge media protection described in this document is not
   a substitute for end-to-end media protection.  A user agent requests
   end-to-access-edge media protection by including a "a=3ge2ae" SDP
   attribute at session setup.  If this attribute is not included, then

   end-to-end protection is expected by the user agent and protection
   MUST NOT fall back to end-to-access-edge protection.

1.1.2.  DTLS-SRTP

1.1.2.1.  Overview of Operation

   DTLS-SRTP is described in RFC 5763 [10], which shows the basic
   message flow in Figure 1.  The DTLS handshake takes place when Bob
   receives the initial INVITE request.  Alice uses the source IP
   address of the DTLS "hello" message (3) as the destination address
   for "hello" message (4) even though Bob does not provide a contact
   address until the 200 OK message (8).



                           Alice            Proxies             Bob
                |(1) INVITE       |                  |
                |---------------->|                  |
                |                 |(2) INVITE        |
                |                 |----------------->|
                |                 |(3) hello         |
                |<-----------------------------------|
                |(4) hello        |                  |
                |----------------------------------->|
                |                 |(5) finished      |
                |<-----------------------------------|
                |                 |(6) media         |
                |<-----------------------------------|
                |(7) finished     |                  |
                |----------------------------------->|
                |                 |(8)  200 OK       |
                |                 |<-----------------|

                |(11) ACK         |                  |

1.1.2.2.  Limitations

   Reasons why DTLS-SRTP is not suitable for some networks are detailed
   in 3GPP TR 33.828 [14] and summarized below.

   In some networks, media packets are blocked between Alice and Bob
   until Alice receives the 200 (OK) message 9, which blocks the DTLS
   handshake until after Alice receives message (9).  Media will not be
   successfully exchanged unless the DTLS handshake is re-attempted
   after message (9) 200 OK.  Even if the handshake is re-attempted, the
   media will be clipped until the handshake is complete.

   Some networks are required by regulation to provide lawful intercept,
   and no method compatible with DTLS-SRTP is available when a UA is
   outside its own network (i.e., roaming).  Also, lawful intercept
   would mandate all users to disclose all their keys all the time,
   which might delay communication setup as networks need the keys prior
   allowing the media.

1.1.3.  SDP Capability Negotiation

   SDP capability negotiation is described in RFC 5939 [11] and
   describes sending multiple potential SDP combinations as an offer,
   such that a user agent can offer a choice of media security
   alternatives in the body of an initial INVITE request.  However, the
   caller UA has no prior knowledge of whether media plane security
   setup will succeed and in many cases it will fail or cause a lengthy
   delay while the user agent re-attempts, for example using a different
   IP access network.

1.1.4.  Motivations for RFC 3329

   RFC3329 describes why security is needed to protect SIP signalling
   from man-in-the-middle attacks, and to accomodate the expected wide
   variation in security mechanism support by SIP entities.  The media
   plane requires similar protection and exchange of security
   capabilities, for example to prevent eavesdropping in environments
   such as public wireless access networks that have no inherent
   security.  For the media plane security mechanism defined by this
   document, the cryptographic key is in plain text in SDP, therefore
   signalling SHOULD be protected e.g. using the security mechanism
   negotiation described by RFC 3329 [4]

1.2.  Design Goals

   Security on the media plane differs from security for signalling,
   because it can be applied per media stream and also because multiple
   media streams can be started and stopped within a single SIP session.

Internet-Draft          Media Security Parameter             August 2011


   For a single media stream, any one of the media plane security
   mechanisms supported by client and server may be applied, or no media
   plane security may be applied at all.  Therefore, this specification
   defines secure capability exchange and use of security mechanisms for
   media, but with no obligation to use the indicated security
   mechanisms.

   1.  The entities involved in the security agreement process need to
       find out exactly which security mechanisms to apply, preferably
       without excessive additional roundtrips.

   2.  The selection of security mechanisms itself needs to be secure.
       Traditionally, all security protocols use a secure form of
       negotiation.  For instance, after establishing mutual keys
       through Diffie-Hellman, IKE sends hashes of the previously sent
       data including the offered crypto mechanisms [9].  This allows
       the peers to detect if the initial, unprotected offers were
       tampered with.

   3.  The security agreement process should not introduce any
       additional state to be maintained by the involved entities.


2.  Solution

   This document defines the "mediasec" header field parameter that
   labels any of the Security-Client:, Security-Server:, or Security-
   Verify: header fields as applicable to the media plane and not the
   signalling plane and the "mediasec" option tag used to indicate or
   require support of the mechanism described in this document.  Any one
   of the mechanisms labelled with the "mediasec" header field parameter
   can be applied on-the-fly as a media stream is started, unlike
   mechanisms for signalling one of which is chosen and then applied
   throughout a session.

2.1.  Header Fields Defined in RFC3329

   As stated earlier, defines security mechanism agreement for
   signalling, including the "sec-agree" option tag that can appear in
   Supported:, Require:, and Proxy-Require: header fields.  The
   "mediasec" header field parameter and the "mediasec" option tag
   defined in this document extend the procedures in RFC 3329 [4] to
   media plane security, with the difference that media plane security
   need not be started immediately, and can be applied and removed on-
   the-fly as media are added and removed within a session.  Media plane
   security can be supported independently of any signalling plane
   security defined in RFC 3329 [4], but in order to protect any
   cryptographic key carried in SDP signalling plane security as defined

Internet-Draft          Media Security Parameter             August 2011


   in RFC 3329 [4] SHOULD be used.  A user agent or proxy that
   implements RFC 3329 [4] but does not implement this document and
   receives the Require; and Proxy-Require; header fields containing
   only the "mediasec" option tag will return a 420 (Bad extension)
   response, thereby informing the entity that sent them that this
   document is not supported.  This document requires the first reliable
   response to include the media plane security capabilities, and
   therefore adds the 2xx response to the SIP responses that can contain
   the Security-Client, Security-Server, and Security-Verfiy header
   fields.  RFC 3329 [4] allows only the Security-Server header field in
   SIP responses 421 (Extension Required) and 494 (Security Agreement
   Required).

2.2.  Overview of Operation

   The message flow is identical to the flow in RFC 3329 [4], but it is
   not mandatory for the user agent to apply media plane security
   immediately after it receives the list of supported media plane
   mechanisms from the server, or any timer after that, nor will the
   lack of a mutually supported media plane security mechanism prevent
   SIP session setup.  In the message flow below, only Step 3 differs
   from RFC 3329 [4].



    1. Client ---------------client list-------------> Server
    2. Client <--------------server list-------------- Server
    3. Client --(optional to turn on media security)-- Server
    4. Client ---------------server list-------------> Server
    5. Client <--------------ok or error-------------- Server


            Figure 2: Security capability exchange message flow

   Step 1: Clients wishing to use this specification can send a list of
   their supported security mechanisms along with the first request to
   the server.

   Step 2: Servers wishing to use this specification can challenge the
   client to perform the security agreement procedure.  The security
   mechanisms and parameters supported by the server are sent along in
   this challenge.

   Step 3: The client may then proceed to select any media security
   mechanism they have in common and to turn on the selected security.

   Step 4: The client contacts the server again, now using the selected
   security mechanism.  The server's list of supported security

   mechanisms is returned as a response to the challenge.

   Step 5: The server verifies its own list of security mechanisms in
   order to ensure that the original list has not been modified.

2.3.  Syntax

   This document does not define any new SIP header fields, it reuses
   Security-Client, Security-Server and Security-Verify defined in RFC
   3329 [4].  However, this document defines the mechanism-name "sdes-
   srtp".  The description of Mechanism-name from RFC 3329 [4] is
   repeated below.

   Mechanism-name

   This token identifies the security mechanism supported by the client,
   when it appears in a Security-Client header field; or by the server,
   when it appears in a Security-Server or in a Security-Verify header
   field.  The mechanism-name tokens are registered with the IANA.  This
   specification defines one value:

   o  "sdes-srtp" for using SDES with SRTP [8].

2.4.  Protocol Operation

2.4.1.  The "mediasec" Header Field Parameter

   The "mediasec" header field parameter may be used in the Security-
   Client, Security-Server, or Security-Verfiy header fields defined in
   RFC 3329 [4] to indicate that a header field applies to the media
   plane.  Any one of the media plane security mechanisms supported by
   both client and server, if any, may be applied when a media stream is
   started.  Or, a media stream may be set up without security.

   Values in the Security-Client, Security-Server, or Security-Verfiy
   header fields labelled with the "mediasec" header field parameter are
   specfic to the media plane and specific to the secure media transport
   protocol used on the media plane.  This document defines the
   following value:

   o  sdes-srtp: SDES security mechanism for SRTP applied end to access
      edge

2.4.2.  Client Initiated

   A client wishing to use the security capability exchange of this
   specification MUST add a Security-Client header field to a request
   addressed to its first-hop proxy (i.e., the destination of the

   request is the first-hop proxy).  This header field contains a list
   of all the media plane security mechanisms that the client supports.
   The client SHOULD NOT add preference parameters to this list.  The
   client MUST add a "mediasec" header field parameter to the Security-
   Client header field.  The client MUST add both Require and Proxy-
   Require header fields with the value "mediasec" to its request.

   The contents of the Security-Client header field may be used by the
   server to include any necessary information in its response.
   However, for the purpose of the media plane security mechanism used
   in this document no such information is necessary.

   A server receiving an unprotected request that contains a Require or
   Proxy-Require header field with the value "mediasec" MUST add a
   Security-Server header field to this response listing the security
   mechanisms that the server supports to its first reliable response to
   the client.  Because this document is an extension of RFC 3329 [4],
   this response will be 494 if the client includes "sec-agree" in the
   Require and Proxy-Require header fields, or a 2xx response if the
   Require and Proxy-Require header fields do not contain "sec-agree".
   The server MUST add its list to the response even if there are no
   common security mechanisms in the client's and server's lists.  The
   server's list MUST NOT depend on the contents of the client's list.

   All the subsequent SIP requests sent by the client to that server MAY
   make use of the security mechanism initiated in the previous step by
   including media plane security parameters in SDP in the session or
   the media description.  These requests MUST contain a Security-Verify
   header field that mirrors the server's list received previously in
   the Security-Server header field.  These requests MUST also have both
   a Require and Proxy-Require header fields with the value "mediasec".

   The server MUST check that the security mechanisms listed in the
   Security-Verify header field of incoming requests correspond to its
   static list of supported security mechanisms.

   Note that, following the standard SIP header field comparison rules
   defined in RFC 3261 [7], both lists have to contain the same security
   mechanisms in the same order to be considered equivalent.  In
   addition, for each particular security mechanism, its parameters in
   both lists need to have the same values.

   The server can proceed processing a particular request if, and only
   if, the list was not modified.  If modification of the list is
   detected, the server MUST respond to the client with a 494 (Security
   Agreement Required) response.  This response MUST include the
   server's unmodified list of supported security mechanisms.  If the
   list was not modified, and the server is a proxy, it MUST remove the

   "mediasec" value from both the Require and Proxy-Require header
   fields, and then remove the header fields if no values remain.

   Once security capabilities have been exchanged between two SIP
   entities, the same SIP entities MAY use the same security when
   communicating with each other in different SIP roles.  For example,
   if a UAC and its outbound proxy exchange some media-plane security
   mechanisms, they may try to use the same security for incoming
   requests (i.e., the UA will be acting as a UAS).

   The user of a UA SHOULD be informed about the results of the security
   mechanism agreement.  The user MAY decline to accept a particular
   security mechanism, and abort further SIP communications with the
   peer.

2.4.3.  Server Initiated

   A server decides to use the security agreement described in this
   document based on local policy.  If a server receives a request from
   the network interface that is configured to use this mechanism, it
   must check that the request has only one Via entry.  If there are
   several Via entries the server is not the first-hop SIP entity and it
   MUST NOT use this mechanism.  For such a request, the server must
   return a 502 (Bad Gateway) response.

   A server that decides to use this agreement mechanism MUST challenge
   unprotected requests with one Via entry regardless of the presence or
   the absence of any Require, Proxy-Require or Supported header fields
   in incoming requests.

   A server that by policy requires the use of this specification and
   receives a request that does not have the mediasec option tag in a
   Require, Proxy-Require or Supported header field MUST return a 421
   (Extension Required) response.  If the request had the "mediasec"
   option tag in a Supported header field, it MUST return a 494
   (Security Agreement Required) response.  In both situations the
   server MUST also include in the response a Security-Server header
   field listing its media-plane security capabilities and a Require
   header field with an option-tag "mediasec" in it.

   Clients that support the extension defined in this document SHOULD
   add a Supported header field with a value of "mediasec".

2.5.  Security Mechanism Initiation

   Once the client chooses a security mechanism from the list received
   in the Security-Server header field from the server, it MAY initiate
   that mechanism on a session level, or on a media level when it

Internet-Draft          Media Security Parameter             August 2011


   initiates new media in an existing session.  For the mechanism
   defined in this document, the UA sends an SDP Offer for an SRTP
   stream containing one or more SDES crypto attributes, each with a key
   and other security context parameters required according to RFC 4568
   [8], together with the attribute "a=3ge2ae", to the next hop proxy.

2.6.  Duration of Security Assocations

   Once media-plane security capabilities have been exchanged, both the
   server and the client need to know until when they can be used.  The
   media plane security mechanism setup is valid for as long as the UA
   has a SIP signalling relationship with its first-hop proxy or until
   new keys are exchanged in SDP.  In many cases, the SDP used to set up
   media plane security will be protected by a security association used
   to protect SIP signalling.  If SIP signalling is protected by a
   security association, then the media plane security mechanism can be
   used until the signalling plane security association expires.

2.7.  Summary of Header Field Use

   The header fields defined in this document may be used to exchange
   supported media plane security mechanisms between a UAC and other SIP
   entities including UAS, proxy, and registrar.  Information about the
   use of headers in relation to SIP methods and proxy processing is
   summarized in Table 1.

                  Table 1: Summary of Header Field Usage

   The "where" column describes the request and response types in which
   the header field may be used.  The header may not appear in other
   types of SIP messages.  Values in the where column are:

Internet-Draft          Media Security Parameter             August 2011


      R: Header field may appear in requests.

      2xx, 421, 494: A numerical value indicates response codes with
      which the header field can be used.

      a: A proxy can add or concatenate the header field if not present.

      r: A proxy must be able to read the header field, and thus this
      header field cannot be encrypted.

      d: A proxy can delete a header field value.



   The next six columns relate to the presence of a header field in a
   method:

      o: The header field is optional.


3.  Backwards Compatibility

   Security mechanisms that apply to the media plane only MUST NOT have
   the same name as any signalling plane mechanism.  If a signalling
   plane security mechanism name is re-used for the media plane and
   distinguished only by the "mediasec" parameter, then implementations
   that do not recognize the "mediasec" parameter may incorrectly use
   that security mechanism for the signalling plane.


4.  Examples

   The following examples illustrate the use of the mechanism defined
   above.

4.1.  Client Initiated

   Typically, media plane security capabilities will be exchanged in
   parallel with security negotiation.  However, it is also possible
   that media plane security capabilities are exchanged independently.

4.1.1.  In Parallel with Security Negotiation

   As per RFC 3329 [4], a UA negotiates the security mechanism for
   signalling to be used with its outbound proxy without knowing
   beforehand which mechanisms the proxy supports as shown in Figure 3
   below.

               Figure 3: Negotiation Initiated by the Client

   The UAC sends an OPTIONS request to its outbound proxy indicating
   security mechanisms for security negotiation and indicating at the
   same time that it is able to exchange capability of security
   mechanisms for the media plane and that it supports SDES for SRTP to
   the next hop.

   The outbound proxy responds to the UAC with its own list of security
   mechanisms, also including SDES for the media plane.  Indication of
   media security mechanisms is identified by the "mediasec" header
   field parameter.  Media security mechanisms are returned by the
   client to the server in the Security-Verify: header field in the same
   way as for signalling security mechanisms.

   When the connection is successfully established, the UAC sends an
   INVITE request including an SDP description of the media plane
   security to be used (a="e2ae" and a crypto attribute).  This INVITE

   contains the server's security lists for both media and signalling
   planes in a Security-Verify header field.  The server verifies it,
   and since it matches its static list, it processes the INVITE and
   forwards it to the next hop.

   If this example was run without the Security-Server header field in
   Step 2, the UAC would not know what kind of security the other one
   supports, and would be forced to make error-prone trials.

   More seriously, if the Security-Verify header field was omitted in
   Step 3, the whole process would be prone to MitM attacks.  An
   attacker could remove the media plane security description from the
   header in Step 1, therefore preventing protection of the media plane.

   The proxy, following its local policy, does not accept the INVITE.
   It returns a 421 (Extension Required) with a Security-Server header
   field that lists SDES for SRTP for the media plane, as well as TLS
   and ipsec-ike for the signalling plane.

   The server includes both sec-agree and mediasec option tags in a
   Require header field.

   Since the UAC supports SDES for SRTP, the second INVITE (4) contains
   a Security-Verify header field that mirrors the Security-Server
   header field received in the 421.  A description of the security to
   be used for the media plane is OPTIONAL in INVITE (4) and will be
   present if security is to be applied to the media in the session.

5.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC 5234 [RFC5234].

   "mediasec" is a "header field parameter", as defined by [RFC3968].

   Header Field Name in which the parameter can appear.

      Security-Client

      Security-Server

      Security-Verify

   Security-Client  mediasec          No        [this document]
   Security-Server  mediasec          No        [this document]
   Security-Verify  mediasec          No        [this document]

6.  Acknowledgements

   Remember, it's important to acknowledge people who have contributed
   to the work.

   This template was extended from an initial version written by Pekka
   Savola and contributed by him to the xml2rfc project.


7.  IANA Considerations

   The "mediasec" parameter and any new security mechanisms for the
   media plane must be IANA registered.  This specification defines a
   new mechanism-name "sdes-srtp" in Section 2.3 which requires a
   central coordinating body.  The body responsible for this
   coordination is the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).

   This document defines one mechanism-name to be initially registered,
   namely "sdes-srtp".  Following the policies outlined in [10], further
   mechanism-names are allocated based on IETF Consensus.

   Registrations with the IANA MUST include the mechanism-name token
   being registered, and a pointer to a published RFC describing the
   details of the corresponding security mechanism.

7.1.  Registration Information

   IANA registers new mechanism-names at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters under "Security
   Mechanism Names".  As this document specifies a mechanism-name, the
   initial IANA registration for mechanism-names will contain the
   information shown in Table 2.  It also demonstrates the type of
   information maintained by the IANA.

7.2.  Registration Template

   To: ietf-sip-sec-agree-mechanism-name@iana.org Subject: Registration
   of a new SIP Security Agreement mechanism

   Mechanism Name:

   (Token value conforming to the syntax described in Section 2.3.)

   Published Specification(s):

   (Descriptions of new SIP Security Agreement mechanisms require a
   published RFC.)

7.3.  Header Field Names

   This specification registers no new header fields.

7.4.  Response Codes

   This specification registers no new response codes.

7.5.  Option Tags

   This specification defines a new option tag, namely mediasec.  The
   option tag is defined by the following information, which has been
   included in the sub-registry for option tags under
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters.

   Name:   mediasec

   Description:
           This option tag indicates support for the Capability Exchange
           for Media Plane Security mechanism.  When used in the
           Require, or Proxy-Require headers, it indicates that proxy
           servers are required to use the Capability Exchange for Media
           Plane Security mechanism.  When used in the Supported header,
           it indicates that the User Agent Client supports the
           Capability Exchange for Media Plane Security mechanism.  When
           used in the Require header in the 494 (Security Agreement
           Required) or 421 (Extension Required) responses, it indicates
           that the User Agent Client must use the Capability Exchange
           for Media Plane Security mechanism.

8.  Security Considerations

   This specification is an extension of RFC 3329 [4] and as such shares
   the same security considerations.

   A further consideration of this specification is protection of the
   cryptographic key to be used for SRTP and carried in SDP.  In order
   to protect this key, one of the security mechanisms defined in RFC
   3329 [4] SHOULD be used in parallel with this specification.
