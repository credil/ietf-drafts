  OSPF extension for priority allocation support in the PCE discovery
             draft-wu-pce-discovery-priority-allocation-00

Abstract

   Each network domain may contain multiple PCE servers.  It provides
   redundancy to the PCCs in the event of a server failure.  However
   load balance decision is made by PCC,it doesn't enable real load
   balance across the PCE servers if PCC still tries PCE one by one and
   PCE doesn't indicate the load status to the PCC.

   This document proposes new PCE discovery sub-TLV that can be
   announced as attribute in the OSPF advertisement (defined in [RFC5088
   ]) to distribute priority information.

Internet-Draft            OSPF for PCE priority                July 2013


1.  Introduction

   Usually a single PCE server sits per domain in the nework.  The PCE
   server disseminates its address in the network using OSPF [RFC5088]
   or ISIS [RFC5089] and the PCCs connect to it automatically.  However
   in some cases, each network domain may contain multiple PCE servers.
   It provides redundancy to the PCCs in the event of a server failure.

   However load balance decision is made by PCC,it doesn't enable real
   load balance across the PCE servers if PCC still tries PCE one by one
   and PCE doesn't indicate the load status to the PCC (e.g., the number
   of incoming requests that have already targeted to the PCE).

   This document proposes new PCE discovery TLV that can be announced as
   attribute in the OSPF advertisement (defined in [RFC5088 ]) to
   distribute priority information.

3.  PCE-ALLOCATION-PRIORITY Sub-TLV for PCE Load Balancing

   The PCE-Allocated-Priority sub-TLV is an optional sub-TLV used to
   indicate allocated priority of each PCE.  The format of the sub-TLVs
   is identical to the TLV format used by the Traffic Engineering
   Extensions to OSPF [RFC3630].  It MAY be present within the PCED TLV.
   It MUST NOT be present more than once.  If it appears more than once,
   only the first occurrence is processed and any others MUST be
   ignored.

   The value field of the PCE-ALLOCATED-PRIORITY sub-TLV is expressed as
   32-bit unsigned integer value..

   The format of the PCE-ALLOCATED-PRIORITY sub-TLV is as follows:
        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |              Type = TBD         |            Length           |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                    Allocated Priority                         |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

         Type:     TBD
         Length:   4 octets
         Value:    This contains allocated priority value for each PCE
                   server. The priority value can be allocated based
                   on PCE load or incoming request to the PCE server.

3.1.  Use of PCE-ALLOCATION-PRIORITY sub-TLV for PCE discovery

   Multiple servers can be present in a single network for redundancy in
   which case each PCE server is allocated with a priority value.  The
   priority can be allocated based on PCE load (e.g., incoming request
   to the PCE server) announced as attribute in the OSPF advertisement.
   The PCC can be configured to use the highest priority PCE server that
   is available or specify the priority of a computation request when
   multiple PCEs has already been found using OSPF[RFC5088].

4.  Security Considerations

   This document raises no new security issues beyond those described in
   [RFC5088].

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains the registry for the TLVs.  PCE-allocated-priority
   sub-TLV will require one new type code per sub-TLV defined in this
   document.
