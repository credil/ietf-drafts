           IPFIX Information Elements for logging NAT Events
                 draft-sivakumar-behave-nat-logging-05

Abstract

   Carrier grade NAT (CGN) devices are required to log events like
   creation and deletion of translations and information about the
   resources it is managing.  The logs are required in many cases to
   identify an attacker or a host that was used to launch malicious
   attacks and/or for various other purposes of accounting.  Since there
   is no standard way of logging this information, different NAT devices
   behave differently and hence it is difficult to expect a consistent
   behavior.  The lack of a consistent way makes it difficult to write
   the collector applications that would receive this data and process
   it to present useful information.  This document describes the
   information that is required to be logged by the NAT devices.

Internet-Draft          IPFIX IEs for NAT logging              July 2012


1.  Terminology

   The usage of the term "NAT device" in this document refer to any
   NAT44 and NAT64 devices.  The usage of the term "collector" refers to
   any device that receives the binary data from a NAT device and
   converts that into meaningful information.  This document uses the
   term "Session" as it is defined in [RFC2663] and the term BIB as it
   is defined in [RFC6146]


2.  Introduction

   This document details the IPFIX Information Elements(IEs) that are
   required for logging by a NAT device.  The document will specify the
   format of the IE's that are required to be logged by the NAT device
   and all the optional fields.  The fields specified in this document
   are gleaned from [RFC4787] and [RFC5382].

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Scope

   This document provides the information model to be used for logging
   the Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) events.  This document focuses
   exclusively on the specification of IPFIX IE's.  This document does
   not provide guidance on the transport protocol like TCP, UDP or SCTP
   that is to be used to log NAT events.  The log events SHOULD NOT be
   lost but the choice of the actual transport protocol is beyond the
   scope of this document.

   The existing IANA IPFIX Information Elements registry [IPFIX-IANA]
   already has assignments for many NAT logging events.  For
   convenience, this document uses those same Information Elements.
   However, as stated earlier, this document is not defining IPFIX or
   Netflow 9 as the framework for logging.  Rather, the information
   contained in these elements is within the scope of this document.

   This document assumes that the NAT device will use the existing IPFIX
   framework to send the log events to the collector.  This would mean
   that the NAT device will specify the template that it is going to use
   for each of the events.  The templates can be of varying length and
   there could be multiple templates that a NAT device could use to log
   the events.

   The implementation details of the collector application is beyond the
   scope of this document.

   The optimization of logging the NAT events are left to the
   implementation and are beyond the scope of this document.


4.  Event based logging

   An event in a NAT device can be viewed as a happening as it relates
   to the management of NAT resources.  The creation and deletion of NAT
   sessions and bindings are examples of events as it results in the
   resources (addresses and ports) being allocated or freed.  The events
   can happen either through the processing of data packets flowing
   through the NAT device or through an external entity installing
   policies on the NAT router or as a result of an asynchronous event
   like a timer.  The list of events are provided in Section 4.1.  Each
   of these events SHOULD be logged, unless they are administratively
   prohibited.  A NAT device MAY log these events to multiple collectors
   if redundancy is required.  The network administrator will specify
   the collectors to which the log records are to be sent.

   A collector may receive NAT events from multiple CGN devices and
   should be able to distinguish between the devices.  Each CGN device
   should have a unique source ID to identify themselves.  The source ID
   is part of the IPFIX template and data exchange.

   Prior to logging any events, the NAT device MUST send the template of
   the record to the collector to advertise the format of the data
   record that it is using to send the events.  The templates can be
   exchanged as frequently as required given the reliability of the
   connection.  There SHOULD be a configurable timer for controlling the
   template refresh.  NAT device SHOULD combine as many events as
   possible in a single packet to effectively utilize the network
   bandwidth.

4.1.  Information Elements

   The templates could contain a subset of the Information Elements(IEs)
   shown in Table 1 depending upon the event being logged.  For example
   a NAT44 session creation template record will contain,

   {sourceIPv4Adress, postNATSourceIPv4Address, destinationIpv4Address,
   postNATDestinationIPv4Address, sourceTransportPort,
   postNAPTSourceTransportPort, destinationTransportPort,
   postNAPTDestTransportPort, natOriginatingAddressRealm, natEvent,
   timeStamp}

   An example of the actual event data record is shown below - in a
   readable form

   {192.168.16.1, 201.1.1.100, 207.85.231.104, 207.85.231.104, 14800,
   1024, 80, 80, 0, 1, 09:20:10:789}

   A single NAT device could be exporting multiple templates and the
   collector should support receiving multiple templates from the same
   source.

   The following is the template of events that will have to logged.
   The events below are identified at the time of this writing but the
   events are expandable.  Depending on the implementation and
   configuration various IE's specified can be included or ignored.

4.4.1.  NAT44 create and delete session event

   This event will be generated when a NAT44 session is created or
   deleted.  The template will be the same, the natEvent will indicate
   whether it is a create or a delete event.  The following is a
   template of the event.

4.4.8.  Address Binding

   This event will be generated when a NAT device binds a local address
   with a global address.  This binding event happens when the first
   packet of the first flow from a host in the private realm.

4.4.9.  Port block allocation and de-allocation

   This event will be generated when a NAT device allocates/de-allocates
   ports in a bulk fashion, as opposed to allocating a port on a per
   flow basis.  NAT devices would do this in order to reduce logs and
   potentially to limit the number of connections a subscriber is
   allowed to use.  In the following Port Block allocation template, the
   portRangeStart must be specified.  Along with portRangeStart, atleast
   one of portRangeEnd, portRangeStepSize or portRangeNumPorts MUST be
   specified.  If portRangeEnd is specified, it MUST NOT be lesser than
   portRangeStart.  The value of portRangeStepSize MUST be between 1 and
   32K.

Internet-Draft          IPFIX IEs for NAT logging              July 2012


5.1.  IPFIX

   This document uses IPFIX as the encoding mechanism to describe the
   logging of NAT events.  However, the information that should be
   logged SHOULD be the same irrespective of what kind of encoding
   scheme is used.  IPFIX is chosen because is it an IETF standard that
   meets all the needs for a reliable logging mechanism.  IPFIX provides
   the flexibility to the logging device to define the data sets that it
   is logging.  The information elements specified for logging MUST be
   the same irrespective of the encoding mechanism used.


6.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Dan Wing, Selvi Shanmugam, Mohamed Boucadir, Jacni Qin
   Ramji Vaithianathan, Simon Perreault and Jean-Francois Tremblay for
   their review and comments.


7.  IANA Considerations

   The following fields are requested to be allocated by the IANA IPFIX
   registry.  These fields are required for CGN devices for logging.

   Name: portRangeStart

   Type: unsigned16

   Semantics: identifier

   Description: The port number identifying the start of a range of
   ports.  A value of zero indicates that the range start is not
   specified, ie the range is defined in some other way.  Additional
   information on defined TCP port numbers can be found at [IANA
   registry port-numbers].

   Name: portRangeEnd

   Type: unsigned16

   Semantics: identifier

   Description: The port number identifying the end of a range of ports.
   A value of zero indicates that the range end is not specified, ie the
   range is defined in some other way.  Additional information on
   defined TCP port numbers can be found at [IANA registry port-
   numbers].

Internet-Draft          IPFIX IEs for NAT logging              July 2012


   Name: portRangeStepSize

   Type: unsigned16

   Semantics: identifier

   Description: The step size in a port range.  The default step size is
   1, which indicates contiguous ports.  A value of zero indicates that
   the step size is not specified, ie the range is defined in some other
   way.

   Name: portRangeNumPorts

   Type: unsigned16

   Semantics: identifier

   Description: The number of ports in a port range.  A value of zero
   indicates that the number of ports is not specified, ie the range is
   defined in some other way.

   The values of the NAT events in Table 2 and the sub-events in Table 3
   are requested to be allocated by the IANA IPFIX registry.


8.  Security Considerations

   None.
