Abstract

   This document focuses on control plane aspect related to both tenant
   system to NVE control interface and NVE to Oracle control interface
   NVE use to enable communication between tenant systems, which is
   complementary to [draft-kreeger-nvo3-hypervisor-nve-cp] that
   describes the high level control plane requirements related to the
   interaction between tenant system and NVE when the two entities are
   not co-located on the same physical device.

1.  Introduction

   In [I.D-ietf-nvo3-overlay-problem-statement], two control planes are
   identified to realize an overlay solution:

   o  NVE to Oracle control plane.

   o  Tenant system to NVE control plane.

   Where NVE to Oracle Control plane is used to deal with address
   mapping dissemination and Tenant System to NVE control plane is used
   to deal with VM attachment and detachment.

   In [I.D-ietf-nvo3-framework], three control plane components are
   defined to build these two control planes and provide the following
   capabilities:

   o  Auto-provision/service discovery

   o  Address advertisement

   o  Tunnel Management

   In [I.D-fw-nvo3-server2vcenter],the control interface between NVE and
   the Oracle backend system or Network Virtualization Authority (NVA)
   is defined to provide the capability:

   o  Enforce the network policy for each VM in the path from the NVE
      Edge associated with VM to the Tenant End System.

   o  Populate forwarding table in the path from the NVE Edge associated
      with VM to the Tenant End System in the data center.

   o  Populate mapping table in each NVE Edge that is in the virtual
      network across data centers under the control of the Director.

   This document focuses on control plane aspect related to both tenant
   system to NVE control interface and NVE to Oracle control interface
   NVE use to enable communication between tenant systems, which is
   complementary to [draft-kreeger-nvo3-hypervisor-nve-cp] that
   describes the high level control plane requirements related to the
   interaction between tenant system and NVE when the two entities are
   not co-located on the same physical device.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

   Site :

      If multiple tenant systems connect to the VN through one NVE, the
      collection of these tenant systems and the NVE associated with
      these tenant systems are referred to as a site or virtualization
      network subnet.

   Tenant System:

      A physical or virtual system that can play the role of a host, or
      a forwarding element such as a router, switch, firewall, etc.  It
      belongs to a single tenant and connects to one or more VNs of that
      tenant.

   vNIC:

      A vNIC is similar to a physical NIC.  Each virtual machine has one
      or more vNIC adapters that it uses to communicate with both the
      virtual and physical networks.  Each vNIC has its own MAC address
      and can be assigned one or more IP address just like a NIC found
      in a non virtualized machine.

3.  NVO3 Control plane Overview

   Figure 1 shows the example NVO3 Networking architecture to give an
   overview of NVO3 control plane for interconnection between VNs or
   between VN and Non-VN.  There are 4 basic network components that
   make up networking architecture: Tenant system, local NVE, remote NVE
   and Network Virtualization Authority.  This example NVO3 networking
   architecture assumes that:

   o  Each server or server blade that is running hypervisor hosts
      multiple virtual machines.

   o  Each tenant system is corresponding to one virtual machine.  Each
      tenant system has only one pNIC and one or more vNIC adapters that
      it uses to communicate with both the virtual and physical
      networks.The pNIC and vNIC adapters each virtual machine has
      belong to a single tenant.

   o  One tenant system or a NVE may belong to one tenant VN or several
      tenant VNs, e.g., TS4 and NVE Edge4 belong to both VN2 and VN3.

   o  If one tenant system belongs to multiple tenant VNs, it may have
      one VM with multiple vNICs and connect to each tenant VN by using
      each of vNICs being attached to one or multiple NVEs,e.g., VM1
      connect to VN1 by being attached to NVE Edge 1.

   o  If one tenant system belongs to multiple tenant VNs, it may have
      multiple VM with each having one vNIC and connect to each tenant
      VN by using each VM vNIC being attached to one or multiple NVEs.

   o  One NVE only belongs to one site.  One site may belong to one
      tenant VN or several tenant VN, e.g., Site 2 belong to both VN2
      and VN3.

   o  If one tenant system in one VN want to communicate with one tenant
      system in another VN, the interconnection functionality or Network
      Virtualization Authority or Network Virtualization controller may
      get involved to help establish interconnection between VN or setup
      tunnel between NVEs associated with the tenant system.

4.  Mapping table entry at the NVE and Network Virtualization Authority

   Suppose a VM has multiple vNICs and one pNIC, each vNIC is
   corresponding to one or multiple tenant system interfaces and one
   pNIC is corresponding to one tenant system interface.  Tenant system
   could be able to directly connect to multiple VNs without needing to
   traverse a NVE or gateway(e.g., tenant system acts as gateway to
   connect to two different VNs).  Therefore every NVE pair( local NVE
   and remote NVE ) associated with the tenant system MUST maintain at
   least one mapping table entry for each currently attached tenant
   system (In the case where TS has multiple tenant system interfaces,
   there may have multiple mapping table entry corresponding to one TS).
   Each mapping table entry corresponds to the Tenant system connection
   to each VN/PN or one Tenant system interface and conceptually may
   contain all or a sub set of the following fields:

   o  The tunnel interface identifier (tunnel-if-id) of the tunnel
      between the remote NVE and the local NVE where the tenant system
      is currently attached.  The tunnel interface identifier is
      acquired during the tunnel creation.

   o  The MAC address of the attached TS.  This MAC address is obtained
      from auto-discovery protocol between Tenant System and its local
      NVE.

   o  The IP address of the attached TS.  This IP address is obtained
      from auto-discovery protocol between Tenant System and its local
      NVE.

   o  The logical interface identifier (e.g., VLAN ID, internal vSwitch
      Interface ID connected to a Tenant System) of the access link
      between the tenant system and the local NVE.  This field is
      required to associate Tenant System with local NVE if local NVE is
      an external NVE to Tenant system.  It is internal to the local NVE
      and is also used to associate the tunnel to the access link where
      the tenant system is attached.

   o  The MAC address of the local NVE associated with the tenant
      system.

   o  The IP address of the local NVE associated with the tenant system.

   o  The Identifier of VN context-VNID.  This Identifier is obtained
      from auto-discovery protocol between Tenant System and its local
      NVE.

   In addition, the Network Virtualization Authority or Oracle backend
   system may also maintain a mapping table entry for each currently

   attached tenant system or each newly joined NVE.  Each mapping table
   entry corresponds to one tenant system interface or the Tenant system
   connection to each VN/Physical Network(PN) and and conceptually may
   contain all or a sub set of the following fields:

   o  The MAC address of the attached TS.  This MAC address is obtained
      from auto-discovery protocol between Tenant System and its local
      NVE.(Optional)

   o  The IP address of the attached TS.  This IP address is obtained
      from auto-discovery protocol between Tenant System and its local
      NVE.  (Optional)

   o  The logical interface identifier (e.g., VLAN ID, internal vSwitch
      Interface ID connected to a Tenant System) of the access link
      between the tenant system and the local NVE.  This field is
      required to associate with Tenant System if local NVE is an
      external NVE to Tenant system.  It is internal to the local NVE
      and is also used to associate the tunnel to the access link where
      the tenant system is attached.

   o  The MAC address of the local NVE associated with the tenant
      system.

   o  The IP address of the local NVE associated with the tenant system.

   o  The Identifier of VN context-VNID.  This Identifier is obtained
      from auto-discovery protocol between Tenant System and its local
      NVE.

4.1.  Mapping table Entry Fields relationship

   One Tenant system is corresponding to one VM.  Each Tenant System may
   have one physical NIC(pNIC) and one or more vNIC adapters that it
   uses to communicate with both the virtual and physical networks.
   Both pNIC and vNIC the tenant system has should belong to a single
   tenant.  Each vNIC or pVNIC must be assigned with one and only one
   unique MAC address.  In addition, each pNIC has only one IP address
   and each vNIC has at least one IP address.  When a VM using one vNIC
   connects to multiple VNs,the vNIC should be assigned with multiple IP
   addresses with each connecting to different VN.  In this case, VM may
   create multiple binding cache entries with each associating one of
   multiple IP addresses to the same unique vNIC MAC address. vNIC MAC
   address may be modified or assigned with a new MAC address at any
   time.  However one vNIC should not use more than one MAC addresses to
   connect to multiple VNs at the same time.  When multiple vNICs hosted
   in the same VM connect to multiple VNs, it is allowed that some of
   these vNICs may connect to different VNs through the same NVE.

4.2.  Multiple TSIs for multiple simultaneous connection support

   If tenant system has multiple Tenant System Interfaces (TSI), Tenant
   System may use these multiple TSIs to connect to multiple VNs
   simultaneously.  Each TSI uses different TSI Identifier
   (e.g.,combination of MAC address,IP address, VNID of vNIC) and
   corresponds to each connection to VN.  In order to distinct one TSI
   from another, Tenant system may create a Binding Identifier (BID) to
   each IP address that is used to connect to VN.  The BID should be
   unique for a given Tenant System Interface.  If the tenant system has
   only Tenant System inteface, the assignment of a BID is not needed
   until it has multiple TSIs, at which time all of TSIs of TS MUST be
   mapped to BIDs.  BID is suggested to be stored in the mapping table

4.3.  Interconnection functionality

   Suppose tenant system A only has one vNIC and is corresponding to a
   VM, when the tenant system A plays the role of interconnection
   functionality to connect two VNs, the following three cases should be
   considered.

      (a) Both two VNs support Layer 3 forwarding;

      (b) Both two VNs support layer 2 forwarding;

      (c) One VN supports Layer3 forwarding and the other VN supports
      layer 2 forwarding;

   For (a), tenant system A or external system that is close to tenant
   system A should support layer 3 forwarding functionality.  When
   source tenant system in one VN communicates with destination tenant
   system in another VN through the tenant system A, if tenant system A
   support layer 3 forwarding, the tenant system A should forward IP
   packets on the behalf of source Tenant System and destination tenant
   system irrespective of data plane encapsulation format(e.g., VXLAN or
   NVGREW, MPLS over GRE).  If two VNs use different data plane
   encapsulation format, the tenant system A should also support
   converting one data plane encapsulation format into another.  If
   tenant system A doesn't support layer 3 forwarding, the external
   system that is close to tenant system A should associate TSI to local
   NVE using information like VNID,TS MAC address and VLAN tag
   information and forward IP packets on the behalf of source tenant
   system and destination tenant system.

   For (b), tenant system A vNIC or external system that is close to
   tenant system A should support layer 2 forwarding functionality.
   When source tenant system in one VN communicates with destination
   tenant system in another VN through the tenant system A, if tenant
   system A support layer 2 forwarding, the tenant system A should know
   which tenant systems connecting to itself are allowed for layer 2
   forwarding and then forward layer 2 frames on the behalf of source
   Tenant System and destination tenant system based on forwarding
   allowed list.  If two layer 2 VNs support different data plane
   encapsulation format, the tenant system A should also support
   converting one data plane encapsulation format to another.  If tenant
   system A doesn't support layer 2 forwarding, the external system that
   is close to tenant system A should associate TSI to local NVE using
   information like VNID, TS MAC address and VLAN tag information and
   forward layer 2 frames on the behalf of source tenant system and
   destination tenant system.

   For (c), tenant system A or external system that is close to tenant
   system A should support both layer 2 forwarding and layer 3
   forwarding.  When source tenant systems in layer 2 VN communicates
   with destination tenant system in layer 3 VN through the tenant
   system A, if tenant system A support both layer 2 and layer 3
   forwarding the tenant system A should support translating layer 2
   frame into layer 3 packet and forward traffic between layer 2 VN and
   layer 3 VN.  If two VNs support different data plane encapsulation
   format, the tenant system A should also support converting one data
   plane encapsulation format to another.  If tenant system A doesn't
   support layer 2 forwarding or layer3 forwarding, the external system
   that is close to tenant system A should associate TSI to local NVE
   using information like VNID,TS MAC address and VLAN tag information
   and forward traffic on the behalf of source tenant system and
   destination tenant system.

   When the tenant system A plays the role of interconnection
   functionality to connect between VN and Non-VN, suppose source tenant
   system in one VN communicates with destination end device in Non-VN
   environment through the tenant system A, the tenant system A acts as
   NVO3 GW between VN and Non-VN in this case peering with other
   Gateways and should be explicitly configured with a list of
   destination MAC addresses that allows passed to the Non-VN
   environment and perform translation between VNID and Non-VN label
   when forwarding traffic between VN interface and Non-VN interface.
   For outgoing frames on VN connected interface, the tenant system A
   decapsulates NVO3 outer header and forwards the inner frame to Non-VN
   environment based on configured allowed list.  For incoming frames on
   non-VN connected interface(e.g.,WAN interface), the tenant system A
   should map the incoming frames from end device to specific VN based
   on inner Ethernet frame information (e.g., VLAN ID).  The mapping
   table is setup at the tenant system A to perform VNID lookup in VN
   and label lookup in the Non-VN environment.

5.  NVE to Oracle Control plane protocol functionality

   The core functional entities for NVE to Oracle Control plane
   infrastructure are the NVE and Network Virtualization Authority.  The
   Network Virtualization Authority is responsible for maintaining the
   tenant system reachability state and is the topological anchor point
   for the Tenant system MAC addresses or Tenant System Names (i.e.,vNIC
   name).  The NVE is the entity that performs the address mapping
   management on behalf of tenant system, and it resides on the access
   link where the tenant system is anchored.  The NVE is responsible for
   detecting the VM's movements to and from the access link and for
   initiating location binding registrations to the tenant system's
   Oracle backend system.  There can be multiple Oracle backend system
   in a VN each serving a different group of tenant system.

5.1.  NVE connect/disconnect notification

   When a tenant system connects to one VN by attaching to a local NVE,
   the local NVE should also be added into VN context together with
   tenant system information.  This helps Network Virtualization
   Authority or Oracle Backend System know with which NVE a group of the
   tenant systems are attached or current location of these tenant
   systems.  When the last tenant system is disconnected to one VN
   through one local NVE, this local NVE should also be removed from VN
   context.  This should also be updated to Network Virtualization
   Authority or Oracle Backend system and let Oracle backend system know
   that there are no tenant system associated with that NVE.

5.2.  VN membership Registration and Query

   In order to enable tenant system A to communicate with any tenant
   system that is not under the same local NVE, the mapping table should
   be distributed to all the remote NVEs that belong to the same VN even
   though there is no tenant system which communicates with tenant
   system A behind that remote NVE.  However how should local NVE know a
   list of remote NVEs that belong to the same VN as local NVE?  In
   order to tackle this, when a tenant system connects to one VN by
   attaching to a local NVE, VN membership (e.g., VNID, VN Name, a list
   of NVE that belong to VN) should be registered to the Network
   Virtualization Authority or Oracle Backend system.  When local NVE
   needs to know which remote NVEs it should forward a data packet,
   Network Virtualization Authority or Oracle backend system can be
   queried by the local NVE.  The Network Virtualization Authority or
   Oracle backend system can redirect the query from local NVE to the
   remote NVEs based on VN membership registration and obtain answer
   from the right remote NVE.  In addition, VM membership may contain
   detailed mapping between tenant system, NVE and VN in the form of
   TESID=<VNID, NVE_ID,TS_ID>.  In this case, The Network Virtualization

Internet-Draft                   NVE2NVA                      April 2013


   Authority or Oracle backend system can directly supply answer for the
   request from the local NVE.

5.3.  Address Mapping information reflection/distribution

   Data plane learning can be used to build mapping table without need
   for control plane protocol.  However it requires each data packet to
   be flooded to the whole VN.  In order to eliminate flooding
   introduced by data plane learning, a control protocol is needed to
   provide both MAC address and IP address in the form of mapping
   information.  When VN membership registration complete, the NVE can
   forward such address mapping information directly to all the remote
   NVEs based on VN membership, alternatively, the NVE also can forward
   such address mapping information indirectly to the Network
   Virtualization Authority or Oracle backend system and let the Network
   Virtualization Authority or Oracle backend system to reflect the
   address mapping information to all the relevant remote NVEs based on
   VN membership.

5.4.  VN context moving

   In some cases, one tenant system may be detached from one NVE and
   move to another NVE.  In such cases, the VN context should be moved
   from the NVE to which the tenant system was previously attached to
   the new NVE to which the tenant system is currently attached.  In
   order to achieve this, the per tenant system VN context including VN
   profile can be maintained at the Network Virtualization Authority or
   Oracle backend system and be retrieved at the new place based on the
   VN Identifier (VNID).

6.  Hypervisor-to-NVE Control Plane Protocol Functionality

6.1.  Multiple TSIs of one TS for multiple simultaneous connections
      support

   Typically, a TSI or a vNIC is assigned with a single MAC address and
   a single IP address.  However, a TSI may be assigned multiple IP
   addresses with each to connect to one VN.  In such case, BID may be
   assigned for each TSI when tenant system wants to register multiple
   IP address with its MAC address corresponding to one TSI
   simultaneously to the local NVE.  If a TSI has only one IP address,
   the assignment of a BID is not needed until it has multiple IP
   addresses to register with, at which time all of the IP addresses of
   TSI MUST be mapped to BIDs.  When a tenant system registers a given
   BID for the first time it MUST send BID together with the IP address
   of TSI.  For any subsequent registrations that either re-register or
   de-register the same BID, the TS only needs send BID and does not
   need to send IP address of TSI associated with BID.

7.  Key functions aspect for signaling control/forwarding info to NVEs

7.1.  Create and Update tenant Virtual Network (VN)

   The tenant virtualization network(VN) is a collection of tenant
   systems, Network Virtualization Edges (NVE)(s) and other end systems
   that are interconnected with each other.  The tenant VN also consists
   of a set of sites where each can send traffic directly to the other.

   In order to create or update a tenant VN, when a Tenant System is
   attached to a local NVE, the tenant system should inform the attached
   local NVE which VN the tenant system belong to.

   o  If the tenant system are the first participant in the VN through
      the local NVE, the tenant system and associated local NVE should
      be firstly added to the VN and the mapping table should be setup
      at the local NVE for each attached tenant system.

   o  If both the tenant system and the local NVE are not on the VN, the
      tenant system and associated local should be firstly added to the
      VN and then the mapping table associated with this tenant system
      should be setup at the local NVE and distributed to the other
      remote NVEs that belong to the same VN.

   o  If the local NVE is on the same tenant VN as the tenant system
      associated with the local NVE, only the tenant system needs to be
      added into the VN, i.e., the local NVE only needs to distribute
      mapping table at the local NVE to the other remote NVEs that
      belong to the same tenant VN.

   o  If the local NVE is not on the same tenant VN as the tenant system
      associated with that local NVE, the local NVE should firstly be
      added into the VN and then distributes the new mapping table at
      the local NVE to the other remote NVEs that belong to the same
      tenant VN.

   o  If one tenant system is the last participant connecting to the VN
      through local NVE, when this tenant system leave the VN, the local
      NVE associated with this tenant system should be removed from the
      VN.The mapping table associated with this tenant system should be
      removed from the local NVE associated with this tenant system.

7.2.  Associate the NVE and tenant system with VN context

   The VN context includes a set of configuration attributes defining
   access and tunnel policies and (L2 and/or L3) forwarding functions.
   When a Tenant System is attached to a local NVE, a VN network
   instance should be allocated to the local NVE.  The tenant system



Wu                      Expires October 21, 2013               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                   NVE2NVA                      April 2013


   should be associated with the specific VN context using virtual
   Network Instance(VNI).  The tenant system should also inform the
   attached local NVE which VN context the tenant system belong to.
   Therefore the VN context can be bound with the data path from the
   tenant system to the local NVE and the tunnel from local NVE
   associated with the tenant system and all the remote NVEs that belong
   to the same VN as the local NVE.  For the data path from the tenant
   system and the local NVE, the network policy can be installed on the
   underlying switched network and forwarding tables also can be
   populated to each network elements in the underlying network based on
   the specific VNI associated with the tenant system.  For the tunnel
   from local NVE to the remote NVEs, the traffic engineering
   information can be applied to each tunnel based on VNI associated
   with the tenant system.

7.3.  Populate mapping tables information at the local NVE

   In some cases, two tenant systems may be attached to the same local
   NVE.  In order to allow the NVE to locally route traffic between two
   tenant systems that are attached to the same NVE, the mapping table
   that maps a final destination address to the proper tunnel should be
   populated at the local NVE.

   In some cases, two tenant systems may connect to the different VNs
   through the same interconnection functionality, in order to allow two
   tenant systems communication between two VNs, the mapping table that
   maps a final destination address to the proper tunnel should be
   populated in both NVE associated with two communicated tenant system
   and the interconnection functionality associated corresponding NVE.

7.4.  Distribute the mapping table information to remote NVEs in the VN

   When the packet sent from one tenant system arrives at the ingress
   NVE associated with that tenant system, in order to determine which
   tunnel the packet needs to be sent to, the mapping table that maps a
   final destination address to the proper tunnel should also be
   distributed to all the remote NVEs in the VN using a control plane
   protocol or dynamic data plane learning.  The mapping table may be
   advertised directly to other remote NVEs that belong to the same VN
   or firstly advertised to the centralized controller that maintain
   global view of NVEs that belong to the same VN and then let the
   centralized controller distribute the mapping tables to all the
   relevant remote NVEs that belong to the same VN.

7.5.  The mapping table information update at the NVE when VM moves or
      connection fails

   In some cases, one tenant system may be detached from one NVE and

   move to another NVE.  In such cases, the mapping table should be
   removed from the NVE to which the tenant system was previously
   attached and the new mapping table should be created at the new NVE
   to which the tenant system is currently attached.  Such mapping table
   should be updated at each remote NVE associated with the tenant
   system and the centralized controller,e.g., the Network
   Virtualization Authority or Oracle Backend system.

   In some cases, one tenant system may fail to connect to the VN
   through the NVE.  In such cases, the mapping table should be removed
   from the NVE to which the tenant system is currently attached.  In
   addition, the mapping table should be updated at each remote NVE in
   the same VN through which the tenant system is communicating with the
   destination tenant system.

7.6.  The VN context re-association at the NVE when VM moves

   In some cases, one tenant system may be detached from one NVE and
   move to another NVE.  In such cases, the VN context should be moved
   from the NVE to which the tenant system was previously attached to
   the new NVE to which the tenant system is currently attached.  In
   order to achieve this, the per tenant system VN context can be
   maintained at the centralized database and be retrieved at the new
   place based on the VN Identifier (VNID).
