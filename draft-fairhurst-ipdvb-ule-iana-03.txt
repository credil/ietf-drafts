              IANA Guidance for Managing the ULE Registry
                   draft-fairhurst-ipdvb-ule-iana-03

Abstract

   This document proposes an update to RFC 4326 to clarify and update
   the allocation rules for the Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation
   (ULE) next header registry.  This registry is used by ULE and Generic
   Stream Encapsulation (GSE) to record the codepoints of extension
   headers and protocols supported by these encapsulation protocols.

Internet-Draft             IANA ULE guidelines                 June 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE) [RFC4326]
   specifies an encapsulation for links that employ the MPEG-2 Transport
   Stream, with support over a wide variety of physical-layer bearers
   [RFC4259].  The encapsulation header includes a Type field that
   identifies payload types and extension headers (e.g.[RFC5163]).  The
   ULE specification requested IANA to maintain the ULE next header
   registries to record the allocation of the values used to derive this
   Type field.

   The Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) Project has published an
   encapsulation for second-generation DVB physical layers.  This
   specifies the Generic Stream Encapsulation [GSE].  This encapsulation
   shares many of the network properties of ULE and uses a common format
   for the Type field [RFC5163].  The ULE Next Header registries are
   therefore also applicable to this encapsulation.

   This document updates the IANA rules and guidance defined in section
   11.1 of [RFC4326] in the following way:

   o  The document clarifies use of the registry by GSE as well as for
      ULE.

   o  Section 3 specifies that new allocations in the ULE Next Header
      Registry are to be assigned by IANA using the "Expert Review"
      policy and provides guidance to the expert reviewer.

   o  Section 3.3 reserves a range of allocated values.

   o  Section 4 adds an explanatory note to clarify the encoding used in
      the registry.


2.  Terminology

   This document assumes familiarity with the terminology of ULE
   [RFC4326] and [RFC5163].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.1.  The ULE Next Header Registries

   The Mandatory Extension Headers registry allocates decimal values in
   the range 0-255.  These values are used to identify mandatory
   extension headers.  The registered value corresponds to the 16-bit

   Type value for the mandatory extension header or the specified
   protocol.

   The Optional Extension Headers registry allocates decimal values in
   the range 256-512.  These values are used to identify optional
   extension headers.  The registered value corresponds to the 16-bit
   Type value that would be used for an optional extension header with a
   length (H-LEN) of 1.


3.  Updated IANA guidance on allocation in the ULE Next Header Registry

   The rules for allocation were defined in section 11 of [RFC4326].
   This document updates these rules by replacing these with the rules
   in this section:

   Allocations in the ULE Next Header Registry are to be assigned by
   IANA using the "Expert Review" policy defined in [RFC5226].
   Applications must include a reference to a specification of the next
   header extension in a standards document.  An IETF standards-track
   RFC can provide such a reference.  Other specifications are also
   permitted.  The expert shall advise IANA on whether a particular
   specification constitutes a standards document.

3.1.  ULE Next-Header Registry

   This registry allocates Next-Header values within the range 0-511
   (decimal).  For each allocated value, it also specifies the set of
   allowed H-LEN values (see [RFC4326] section 5).  The combination of
   the IANA-registered value and the H-LEN are used by ULE and GSE to
   derive a set of allowed 16-bit values in the decimal range 0-1535.
   This forms the first part of the ULE Type space (see [RFC4326]
   section 4.4.1).

3.2.  IANA Guidelines

   The following contains the IANA guidelines for management of the ULE
   Next-Header registry.  This registry allocates decimal values 0-511
   (0x0000-0x01FF, hexadecimal).  IANA MUST NOT allocate values greater
   than 511 (decimal).

   The Next-Header registry is divided into two areas:

   1.  0-255 (decimal) IANA-assigned values, indicating Mandatory
       Extension Headers (or link-dependent Type fields).  Requests for
       assignment in this area MUST define the value and the name
       associated with the Extension Header, together with the procedure
       for processing the Extension Header.  This MUST also define the

       need for the Mandatory Extension and the intended use.  [RFC4326]
       made initial assignments to this registry updated by later
       requests.  The size of the Extension Header MUST be specified (by
       default the entire remaining payload).

   2.  256-511 (decimal) IANA-assigned values, indicating Optional
       Extension Headers.  Requests for assignment in this area MUST
       define the value and the name associated with the Extension
       Header, together with the procedure for processing the Extension
       Header.  The entry MUST specify the range of allowable H-LEN
       values that are permitted (in the range 1-5).  It MUST also
       define the need for the Optional Extension and the intended use.
       [RFC4326] made initial assignments to this registry updated by
       later requests.

3.3.  Reservation of Next Header values

   This document reserves the range decimal 144-159 (0x80-0x8F,
   hexadecimal).  These reserved values are presently not available for
   general assignment, and will not be allocated until the registry is
   exhausted.


4.  Update to registry information

   This section requests IANA to record additional explanatory note in
   the registry:

   "The Mandatory Extension Headers registry allocates values in the
   range 0-255 (decimal).  These values are used to identify mandatory
   extension headers.  The registered value corresponds to the 16-bit
   Type value for the mandatory extension header or the specified
   protocol.

   The Optional Extension Headers registry allocates values in the range
   256-511 (decimal).  These values are used to identify optional
   extension headers.  The registered value corresponds to the 16-bit
   Type value that would be used for an optional extension header with a
   header length (H-LEN) of 1."

   This additional note should be placed before the current note.


5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not present new security considerations.
