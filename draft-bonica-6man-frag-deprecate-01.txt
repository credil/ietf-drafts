1.  Introduction

   Each link on the Internet is characterized by a Maximum Transmission
   Unit (MTU).  A link's MTU represents the maximum packet size that can
   be conveyed over the link, without fragmentation.  MTU is a
   unidirectional metric.  A bidirectional link may be characterized by
   one MTU in the forward direction and another MTU in the reverse
   direction.  IPv6 [RFC2460] requires that every link in the Internet
   have an MTU of 1280 octets or greater.  On any link that cannot
   convey a 1280-octet packet in one piece, link-specific fragmentation
   and reassembly must be provided at a layer below IPv6.  Therefore,
   the PMTU between any two IPv6 nodes is 1280 bytes or greater.

   Likewise, for any given source node, the path to a particular
   destination node is characterized by a path MTU (PMTU).  At a given
   source, the PMTU associated with a destination is equal to the
   minimum MTU of all of the links that contribute to the path between
   the source and the destination.

   [RFC2460] strongly recommends that IPv6 nodes implement Path MTU
   Discovery (PMTUD) [RFC1981], in order to discover and take advantage
   of PMTUs greater than 1280 octets.  However, a minimal IPv6
   implementation (e.g., in a boot ROM) may simply restrict itself to

   sending packets no larger than 1280 octets, and omit implementation
   of PMTUD.

   In order to send a packet larger than a path's MTU, a node may use
   the IPv6 Fragment header to fragment the packet at the source and
   have it reassembled at the destination(s).  However, the use of such
   fragmentation is discouraged in any application that is able to
   adjust its packets to fit the measured path MTU (i.e., down to 1280
   octets).

   In IPv6, a packet can be fragmented only by the host that originates
   it.  This constitutes a departure from the IPv4 [RFC0791]
   fragmentation strategy, in which a packet can be fragmented by its
   originator or by any router that it traverses en route to its
   destination.

   This memo deprecates the IPv6 Fragment Header.  It provides reasons
   for deprecation and updates [RFC2460].

2.  Case For Deprecation

   This section presents a case for deprecating the IPv6 Fragment
   Header.

2.1.  Resource Conservation

   Packets that are fragmented at their source need to be reassembled at
   their destination.  [Kent87] points out that the reassembly process
   is resource intensive.  It consumes significant compute and memory
   resources.  While the cited reference refers to IPv4 fragmentation
   and reassembly, many of its criticisms are equally applicable to
   IPv6.

   By comparison, if a source node were to execute PMTUD procedures, and
   if applications were to avoid sending datagrams that would result in
   IP packets that exceed the PMTU, the task of reassembly could be
   avoided, altogether.

2.2.  Fragmentation Is Rare

   Today, most popular operating systems implement PMTUD or an extension
   thereof, called Packetization Layer MTU Discovery (PMTUD) [RFC4821].
   Most popular TCP [RFC0793] implementations leverage this technology
   and restrict their segment size so that IP fragmentation is not
   required.  As a result, IPv6 fragments carrying TCP payload are
   rarely observed on the Internet.

Internet-Draft          IPv6 Fragment Deprecated               June 2013


   Likewise, many UDP-based [RFC0768] applications follow the
   recommendations of [RFC5405].  According to [RFC5405], "an
   application SHOULD NOT send UDP datagrams that result in IP packets
   that exceed the MTU of the path to the destination.  Consequently, an
   application SHOULD either use the path MTU information provided by
   the IP layer or implement path MTU discovery itself to determine
   whether the path to a destination will support its desired message
   size without fragmentation.  Applications that do not follow this
   recommendation to do PMTU discovery SHOULD still avoid sending UDP
   datagrams that would result in IP packets that exceed the path MTU.
   Because the actual path MTU is unknown, such applications SHOULD fall
   back to sending messages that are shorter than the default effective
   MTU for sending."  The effective MTU for IPv6 is 1280 bytes.

   Because many UDP-based applications follow the above-quoted
   recommendation, IPv6 fragments carrying UDP traffic are also rarely
   observed on the Internet.

2.2.1.  UDP-based Applications That Rely on Fragmentation

   The following is a list of UDP-based applications that do not follow
   the recommendation of [RFC5405] and rely in IPv6 fragmentation:

   o  DNSSEC [RFC4035].  (However, it is useful to note the DNS queries
      and responses can run over TCP.)

   The effectiveness of these protocols may currently be degraded by
   operator behavior.  SeeSection 2.4 for details.

2.3.  Attack Vectors

   Security researchers have found and continue to find attack vectors
   that rely on IP fragmentation.  For example,
   [I-D.ietf-6man-oversized-header-chain] and
   [I-D.ietf-6man-nd-extension-headers] describe variants of the tiny
   fragment attack [RFC1858].  In this attack, a packet is crafted so
   that it can evade stateless firewall filters.  The stateless firewall
   filter matches on fields drawn from the IPv6 header and an upper
   layer header.  However, the packet is fragmented so that the upper
   layer header, or a significant part of that header, does not appear
   in the first fragment.  Because a stateless firewall cannot parse
   payload beyond the first fragment, the packet evades detection by the
   firewall.

   Security researcher have also studied reassembly algorithms on
   popular computing platforms, with the following goals:

   o  to discover fragility in seldom exercised parts of the IP stack

Internet-Draft          IPv6 Fragment Deprecated               June 2013


   o  to engineer flows that maximize resources consumed by the
      reassembly process

   The Dawn and Rose Attacks [Hollis] are the products of such research.

   All of the attack vectors mentioned above can be mitigated with
   firewalls and increasingly sophisticated reassembly algorithms.
   However, the continued investment required to mitigate newly
   discovered vulnerabilities detracts from the cost effectiveness of
   IPv6 as a networking solution.

2.4.  Operator Behavior

   For reasons described above, and also articulated in
   [I-D.taylor-v6ops-fragdrop], many network operators filter all IPv6
   fragments.  Also, the default behavior of many currently deployed
   firewalls is to discard IPv6 fragments.

   In one recent study [DeBoer], two researchers distributed probes to
   423 IPv6 enabled sites.  The researchers then tested connectivity
   between an experimental control center and the probes.  They found
   that during any given trial period, sixty percent of the sites that
   could be reached with unfragmented packets could also be reached with
   fragmented packets.  The remaining forty percent appeared to be
   filtering IPv6 fragments

3.  Recommendation

   This memo deprecates IPv6 fragmentation and the IPv6 fragment header.
   New application and transport layer protocols MUST NOT send datagrams
   that result in IPv6 packets exceeding the MTU of the path to the
   destination.  However, legacy applications and transport layer
   protocols will continue to do so.

   New IPv6 host implementations MAY support IPv6 fragmentation and
   reassembly, but are not required to do so.

   Network operators MAY filter IPv6 fragments.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to mark the Fragment Header for IPv6 (44) as
   deprecated in the Protocol Numbers registry.

5.  Security Considerations

   Deprecation of the IPv6 Fragment Header will improve network security
   by eliminating attacks that rely on fragmentation.
