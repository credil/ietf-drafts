1.  Introduction

   The Diameter Network Access Server (NASREQ) Application [RFC4005]
   specifies methods to deal with various interactions between the
   RADIUS [RFC2865] and Diameter [RFC3588] protocols.  In particular,
   the translation of RADIUS messages and attributes to and from
   Diameter commands and Attribute-Value Pairs (AVPs) is described at
   some length.  However, there is a fundamental and insurmountable
   problem with attempting to translate Diameter protocol elements into
   RADIUS protocol elements: a single Diameter AVP may be much larger
   than an entire RADIUS message.  Various workarounds have been
   proposed to ameliorate this proble, including limiting the size of
   Diameter elements that might require translation into RADIUS and
   returning an error upon receipt of an untranslatable AVP.  The former
   approach uneccessarily limits the utility of, for example, the NASREQ
   application in pure Diameter deployments while the latter can result
   in the denial of service to otherwise legitimate users.

   This document describes a simple method to solve the problems of
   interaction between RADIUS and Diameter by taking advantage of the
   fact thata RADIUS message can fit into a single Diameter AVP.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  The RADIUS-Diameter Gateway Application

   The following sections define the syntax, semantics and usage of the
   RADIA application.

3.1.  Advertising Application Support

   Servers and proxies supporting the RADIUS-Diameter Gateway
   application MUST advertise support by including the value <AID> in
   the Auth-Application-Id of the Capabilities-Exchange-Request (CER),
   Accounting-Request (ACR), Accounting-Answer (ACA), RADIA-Request
   (RDR), and RADIA-Answer (RDA) messages.

3.2.  Diameter Session Usage

   Session usage in the RADIA application is identical to that in
   NASREQ.

3.3.  Commands

   The RADIA application defines two new commands: Gateway-Request (RDR)
   and Gateway-Answer (RDA).  The following sections describe these
   commands.

3.3.1.  The RADIA-Request (RDR) Command

   The peer sends the RADIA-Request (RDR) command, indicated by the
   Command-Code field set to <CC1> and the Command Flags' 'R' bit set,
   in order to transmit a RADIUS message (encapsulated in the Radius-
   Message AVP (Section 3.4.1)) toward its final destination.  The
   Radius-Message AVP will generally encapsulate a RADIUS request
   message (e.g., Access-Request).

   Message format:

         <RDR> ::= < Diameter Header: CC1, REQ, PXY >
                   { Origin-Host }
                   { Origin-Realm }
                   { Destination-Realm }
                   { Auth-Application-Id }
                   { Radius-Message}
                   [ Destination-Host ]
                 * [ Proxy-Info ]
                 * [ Route-Record ]
                 * [ AVP ]

3.3.2.  The RADIA-Answer (RDA) Command

   The peer sends the RADIA-Answer (RDA) command, indicated by the
   Command-Code field set to <CC2> and the Command Flags' 'R' bit set,
   in order to transmit a RADIUS message (encapsulated in the Radius-
   Message AVP (Section 3.4.1)) toward its final destination.  The
   Radius-Message AVP will generally encapsulate a RADIUS reply message
   (e.g., Access-Accept).

   Message format:

         <RDA> ::= < Diameter Header: CC2, REQ, PXY >
                   { Origin-Host }
                   { Origin-Realm }
                   { Destination-Realm }
                   { Auth-Application-Id }
                   { Radius-Message}
                   [ Destination-Host ]
                 * [ Proxy-Info ]
                 * [ Route-Record ]

                 * [ AVP ]

3.4.  Attribute-Value Pairs

   This section describes the single AVP specific to the RADIUS-Diameter
   Gateway application.

3.4.1.  Radius-Message AVP

   The Radius-Message AVP (AVP code <AVP>) is of type OctetString.  The
   'M' bit MUST be set and the 'V' bit MUST NOT be set.  The AVP
   contains a complete RADIUS message.


4.  Security Considerations

   The protocol defined in this specification has no effect upon the
   security of either Diameter or RADIUS.


5.  IANA Considerations

   Upon publication of this memo as an RFC, IANA is requested to assign
   values as described in the following sections.

5.1.  Diameter Application Identifier

   An application identifier for Diameter RADIUS-Diameter Gateway
   (<AID>, Section 3) must be assigned according to the policy specified
   in Section 11.3 of RFC 3588.

5.2.  Diameter Command Codes

   Command codes must be assigned for the RADIA-Request (RDR) (<CC1>,
   Section 3.3.1) and RADIA-Answer (RDA) (<CC2>, Section 3.3.2) commands
   according to the policy specified in RFC 3588, Section 11.2.1.

5.3.  Attribute-Value Pairs

   A code must be assigned for the following AVP using the policy
   specified in RFC 3588, Section 11.1.1: Radius-Message (<AVP>,
   Section 3.4.1).
