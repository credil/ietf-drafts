                Protocol to query a White Space Database
              draft-caufield-paws-protocol-for-tvws-01.txt

Abstract

   Regulatory entities in many countries are making spectrum previously
   used by television stations available for secondary use as a result
   of the switch from analog to digital.  The spectrum in such cases is
   still owned by the primary user to whom it is licensed.  However
   parts of the spectrum may be unused at a given location or time and
   hence can be made available for secondary use.  In order to use such
   spectrum a device has to query a database in order to obtain a list
   of available channels or spectrum at a given location and time.  This
   document specifies protocol elements that can be used to query a
   white space database and obtain a response by a device.

Internet-Draft           Protocol to query WS DB            October 2011


1.  Introduction

   Regulatory entities in many countries are making spectrum previously
   used by television stations available for secondary use as a result
   of the switch from analog to digital.  The spectrum in such cases is
   still owned by the primary user to whom it is licensed.  However
   parts of the spectrum may be unused at a given location or time and
   hence can be made available for secondary use.  In order to use such
   spectrum a device has to query a database in order to obtain a list
   of available channels or spectrum at a given location and time.  This
   document specifies protocol elements that can be used to query a
   white space database and obtain a response by a device.

   The problem statement, use cases and requirements for the use of
   white space spectrum and the associated protocol is captured in the
   document: [I-D.ietf-paws-problem-stmt-usecases-rqmts].


2.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document relies on the terminology specified in
   [I-D.ietf-paws-problem-stmt-usecases-rqmts].


3.  Background

   Spectrum is a scarce resource and hence it is essential that
   technology provide a means to use this resource in an optimal manner.
   Spectrum has been generally licensed or granted or reserved for
   specific use by regulatory bodies and governments.  Some spectrum
   such as the ISM band has been made publicly available for use without
   any licenses but still with a set of regulations.  In many cases
   spectrum that has been licensed to an entity or reserved is either
   not utilized or under utilized.  As the demand for services over
   wireless medium continues to grow the need for additional spectrum is
   increasing.  Cognitive radio and white space technology is a solution
   that allows the use of spectrum by a secondary user at a given
   location if the primary user is either not using the spectrum at a
   given time and without causing interference to the primary user.
   Regualtions to this effect have been specified by the FCC in the US
   and other regulatory bodies in many other countries are also studying
   similar approaches for parts of the spectrum.

   One of the approaches to determining if spectrum is available at a

   given location and time is to query a centralized database and obtain
   information about what channels or spectrum can be used.  There may
   exist multiple databases from which such information can be obtained.
   A standardized query/response mechanism is in the scope of the PAWS
   working group.  This document proposes a data format for the query
   and response aspects of the protocol.


4.  Problem Statement

   The query/response protocol to obtain information about available
   channels or spectrum can be specified using various means.  LDAP is
   an example of a protocol that can be used for this purpose.  However
   one of the objectives of this protocol is to ensure that it is
   globally applicable and can be adapted for use in various regulatory
   environments.  The elements of the query and response can vary
   depending on the country or region where a device is making a query
   to a database.  As a result of this objective, flexibility of the
   protocol in terms of the attributes and parameters carried in the
   query and response are quite important.


5.  Protocol approach

   This document does not specify the complete protocol itself.  The
   protocol can be split into three parts:

   1.  The data model
   2.  The transport protocol
   3.  The security solution

   A data model for the query/response protocol is proposed in this
   document.  A hierarchical object model approach is used for defining
   the query/response and its attributes.  The figure below is a high-
   level view of how the data model is structured:

6.  Data Model details

   The data model includes two main objects, the wsQuery and wsResponse
   objects.  Each of these objects contain a list of elements.  The
   elements are further comprised of attributes.  The wsQuery object is
   sent by a WS Master device to a database and the database responds
   with a wsResponse object.  The actual message and header in which
   this object is carried is not specified here and is expected to be
   specified elsewhere.  Neither does this document specify how the
   device discovers the database or how the object is transported or
   secured.

6.1.  White Space Query Object

   The whitespaceQuery object is a data object carried in a request
   message that any white space client (e.g. a white space device,
   software application, coexistence manager, etc.) may use to request
   information from a white space database, as part of a Rules-compliant
   data transaction.

6.2.  White Space Response Object

   A whitespaceResponse object is a generalized message response
   structure that any white space administrator (e.g. a white space
   database implementation) may use to communicate white space
   information in a Rules-compliant data transaction.

   The whitespaceResponse object structure is intended to accommodate
   various responses to information queries from different white space
   client such as, for example, white space devices (for transmission),
   management systems (not for transmission) and consumers (not for
   transmission).

6.3.17.  Transmitter Element

   The transmitter object provides an extensible software template to
   contain and exchange required and optional but otherwise useful
   transmitter information.

   A transmitter provides an object template for common device-related
   attributes and may be optionally used directly or, more likely, may
   be extended by other, more specific transmitter descriptions that
   fully describe a certain type wireless device.  For this reason all
   transmitter attributes and elements are defined as optional by
   default.  Attribute and element validity is expected to be defined in
   transmitter-derived objects.  The transmitter is designed to support,
   through extension, the communication of required and optional but
   otherwise useful information about licensed and unlicensed wireless
   devices including transmitters, receivers and transceivers.

   This document will require actions on the part of IANA to assign
   values for the new messages and attributes.


8.  Security Considerations

   This document defines the data model for the database query and
   response protocol to be used between white space devices and a
   database.  The actual security for the messages that transport these
