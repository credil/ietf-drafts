Abstract

   This document aims at establishing a common understanding about
   potential experimental setups where different information-centric
   networking (ICN) approaches can be tested and compared against each
   other while showcasing their advantages.  Towards this end, we
   develop several scenarios in an iterative fashion, starting by
   reviewing pertinent ICN evaluations from the published literature. 
   That is, the document includes scenarios which have all been
   considered in one or more performance evaluation studies and are
   already available to the community.  The scenarios selected aim to
   exercise a variety of aspects that an ICN solution can address.  On
   the one hand, we consider general aspects, such as, network
   efficiency, reduced complexity, increased scalability and
   reliability, mobility support, multicast and caching performance,
   real-time communication efficacy, energy consumption frugality, and
   disruption and delay tolerance. On the other hand, we focus on ICN-
   specific aspects, such as, information security and trust,
   persistence, availability, provenance, and location independence.

1  Introduction

   Information-centric networking (ICN) marks a fundamental shift in
   communications and networking.  In contrast with the omnipresent and
   very successful host-centric paradigm, which is based on perpetual
   connectivity and the end-to-end principle, ICN changes the focal
   point of the network architecture from the "end host" to
   "information" (or content, or data).  In this paradigm, connectivity
   may well be intermittent.  End-host and in-network storage can be
   capitalized upon transparently, as bits in the network and on storage
   devices have exactly the same value.  Mobility and multiaccess are
   the norm.  Any-, multi-, and broadcasting are supported by default,
   and energy efficiency is a design consideration from the beginning.  

   Although interest in ICN is growing rapidly, ongoing work on
   different architectures, such as, for example, NetInf [NetInf], CCN
   and NDN [CCN], the publish-subscribe Internet (PSI) architecture
   [PSI], and the data-oriented architecture [DONA] is far from being
   completed.  The development phase that ICN is going through and the
   plethora of approaches to tackle the hardest problems make this a
   very active and appealing research area but, on the downside, it also
   makes it more difficult to compare different proposals on an equal
   footing.

   Ahlgren et al. note [SoA] that describing ICN architectures is akin
   to shooting a moving target.  We find that comparing these different
   approaches is often even more tricky.  It is not uncommon that
   different researchers select different performance evaluation
   scenarios, typically with good reasons, in order to highlight the
   advantages of their approach.  This should be expected to some degree
   at this early stage of development.  Nevertheless, we argue that

INTERNET DRAFT           ICN Baseline Scenarios           March 11, 2013


   certain scenarios seem to emerge where ICN architectures could
   showcase their superiority over current systems, in general, and
   against each other, in particular.

   This document starts in Section 2 by collecting several scenarios
   from the published ICN literature and aims to use them as foundation
   for the baseline scenarios to be considered by the IRTF Information-
   Centric Networking Research Group (ICNRG) in its future work.  The
   list of scenarios can obviously change, as input from the research
   group is received.  For example, this revision adds scenarios
   stemming from recent work exploring "Network Interaction" in ICN. 
   Furthermore, a first draft outline for an ICN evaluation methodology
   is introduced in Section 3.


2  Toward ICN Baseline Scenarios

   This section presents a number of scenarios grouped into several
   categories.  Note that certain evaluation scenarios span across these
   categories, so the boundaries between them should not be considered
   rigid and inflexible.  The goal is that each scenario should be
   described at a sufficient level of detail so that it can serve as the
   base for comparative evaluations of different approaches.  This will
   need to include reference configurations, topologies, specifications
   of traffic mixes and traffic loads.  These specifications (or
   configurations) should preferably come as sets that describe extremes
   as well as "typical" usage scenarios.


2.1  Social Networking

   Social networking applications proliferated over the past decade
   based on overlay content dissemination systems that require large
   infrastructure investments to rollout and maintain.  Content
   dissemination is at the heart of the ICN paradigm and, therefore, we
   would expect that they are a "natural fit" for showcasing the
   superiority of ICN over traditional client-server TCP/IP-based
   systems.

   Mathieu et al. [ICN-SN], for instance, illustrate how an Internet
   Service Provider (ISP) can capitalize on CCN to deploy a short-
   message service akin to Twitter at a fraction of the complexity of
   today's systems.  Their key observation is that such a service can be
   seen as a combination of multicast delivery and caching.  That is, a
   single user addresses a large number of recipients, some of which
   receive the new message immediately as they are online at that
   instant, while others receive the message whenever they connect to
   the network.

INTERNET DRAFT           ICN Baseline Scenarios           March 11, 2013


   Along similar lines, Kim et al. [VPC] present an ICN-based social
   networking platform in which a user shares content with her/his
   family and friends without the need for centralized content server;
   see also section 2.4, below, and [CBIS].  Based on the CCN naming
   scheme, [VPC] takes a user name to represent a set of devices that
   belong to the person.  Other users in this in-network, serverless
   social sharing scenario can access the user's content not via a
   device name/address but with the user's name.  In [VPC], signature
   verification does not require any centralized authentication server. 
   Kim and Lee [VPC2] present a proof-of-concept evaluation in which
   users with ordinary smartphones can browse a list of members or
   content using a name, and download the content selected from the
   list.

   In short, in both evaluations there is no need for a classic client-
   server architecture (let alone a cloud-based infrastructure) to
   intermediate between content providers and consumers in a hub-and-
   spoke fashion.

   Earlier work by Arianfar et al. [CCR] considers a similar pull-based
   content retrieval scenario using a different architecture, pointing
   to significant performance advantages.  Although the authors consider
   a  network topology (redrawn in Fig. 1 for convenience) that has
   certain interesting characteristics, they do not explicitly address
   social networking in their evaluation scenario.  Nonetheless,
   similarities are easy to spot: "followers" (such as C0, C1, ..., and
   Cz in Fig. 1) obtain content put "on the network" (I1, ..., Im, and
   B1, B2) by a single user (e.g. Px) relying solely on network
   primitives.

INTERNET DRAFT           ICN Baseline Scenarios           March 11, 2013


   The social networking scenario aims to exercise each ICN architecture
   in terms of network efficiency, multicast support, caching
   performance and its reliance on centralized mechanisms (or lack
   thereof).


2.2  Real-time A/V Communications

   Real-time audio and video (A/V) communications include an array of
   services ranging from one-to-one voice calls to multi-party multi-
   media conferences with video and whiteboard support to augmented
   reality.  Real-time communications have been studied and deployed in
   the context of packet- and circuit-switched networks for decades. 
   The stringent quality of service requirements that this type of
   communication imposes on network infrastructure is well-known.  Some
   could argue that network primitives which are excellent for
   information dissemination are not well-suited for conversational
   services.

   Notably,  Jacobson et al. [VoCCN] presented an early evaluation where
   the performance of a VoIP call over an information-centric approach
   was compared with that of an off-the-shelf VoIP implementation using
   RTP/UTP.  The results indicated that despite the extra cost of adding
   security support in the former case, performance was virtually
   identical in the two cases evaluated in a testbed.  However, the
   experimental setup presented is quite rudimentary and the evaluation
   considered a single voice call only.  This scenario does illustrate
   that quality telephony services are feasible with at least one ICN
   approach, but it would need to be further enhanced to include more
   comprehensive metrics as well as standardized call arrival patterns,
   for example, following well-established methodologies from the
   quality of service/experience (QoS/QoE) evaluation toolbox.

   Given the wide-spread deployment of real-time A/V communications, an
   ICN approach should demonstrate more than feasibility.  For example,
   with respect to multimedia conferencing, Zhu et al. [ACT] describe
   the design of a distributed audio conference tool based on NDN.  The
   design includes ICN-based conference discovery, speakers discovery
   and voice data distribution.  The reported evaluation results point
   to gains in scalability and security.  Moreover, Chen et al. [G-
   COPSS] explore the feasibility of implementing a Massively
   Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) based on CCNx and show
   that stringent temporal requirements can be met while scalability is
   significantly improved when compared to an IP client-server system. 
   This type of work points to benefits both in the data path and the
   control path of a modern network infrastructure.

   All in all, however, the ICN research community has hitherto only

INTERNET DRAFT           ICN Baseline Scenarios           March 11, 2013


   scratched the surface of this area with respect to illustrating the
   benefits of adopting an information-centric approach as opposed to a
   host-centric one.  Arguably, more work is needed in this direction.

   In short, scenarios in this category should illustrate not only
   feasibility but reduced complexity, increased scalability,
   reliability, and capacity to meet stringent QoS/QoE requirements when
   compared to established host-centric solutions.


2.3  Mobile Networking

   IP mobility management relies on mobility anchors to provide
   ubiquitous connectivity to end-hosts as well as moving networks. 
   This is a natural choice for a host-centric paradigm that requires
   end-to-end connectivity and continuous network presence [SCES].  An
   implicit assumption in host-centric mobility management frameworks is
   that the mobile node aims at connecting to a particular peer, not at
   retrieving information [EEMN].  However, with ICN new ideas about
   mobility management should come to the forefront, which capitalize on
   the different nature of the paradigm.

   For example, Dannewitz et al. [N-Scen], consider a scenario where a
   multiaccess end-host can retrieve email securely using a combination
   of cellular and wireless local area network (WLAN) connectivity. 
   This scenario borrows elements from previous work, e.g. [DTI], and
   develops them further with respect to multiaccess.  Unfortunately,
   Dannewitz et al. [N-Scen] do not present any results demonstrating
   that an ICN approach is indeed better.  That said, the scenario is
   interesting as it considers content specific to a single user (i.e.
   her mailbox) and does point to reduced complexity.  It is also
   compatible with recent work in the Distributed Mobility Management
   (DMM) Working Group within the IETF.  Finally, Xylomenos et al.
   [PSIMob] as well as [EEMN] argue that an information-centric
   architecture can avoid the complexity of having to manage tunnels to
   maintain end-to-end connectivity as is the case with mobile anchor-
   based protocols such as Mobile IP (and its variants).

   Overall, mobile networking scenarios have not been developed in
   detail, let alone evaluated in a wide scale.  We expect that in the
   coming period more papers will address this topic, each perhaps
   proposing its own evaluation scenario.  Earlier work [mNetInf] argues
   that for mobile and multiaccess networking scenarios we need go
   beyond the current mobility management mechanisms in order to
   capitalize on the core ICN features.  They present a testbed setup
   (redrawn in Fig. 2) which can serve as the basis for other ICN
   evaluations.  Lindgren [HybICN] explores this scenario further using
   simulation for an urban setting and reports sizable gains in terms of

INTERNET DRAFT           ICN Baseline Scenarios           March 11, 2013


   reduction of object retrieval times and core network capacity use.

   One would expect that mobile networking scenarios will be naturally
   coupled with those discussed in the previous sections, as more users
   access social networking and multimedia applications through mobile
   devices.  Further, the constraints of real-time A/V applications
   create interesting challenges handling mobility, particularly in
   terms of maintaining service continuity.

   Figure 2.  Overlapping wireless multiaccess

   Mobile networking scenarios should aim to exercise service continuity
   for those applications that require it, decrease complexity and
   control signaling for the network infrastructure, as well as increase
   wireless capacity utilization by taking advantage of the broadcast
   nature of the medium.


2.4  Infrastructure Sharing

   A key idea in ICN is that the network should secure information
   objects per se, not the communications channel that they are
   delivered over.  This means that hosts attached to an information-
   centric network can share resources on an unprecedented scale,
   especially when compared to what is possible in an IP network.  All
   devices with network access and storage capacity can contribute their
   resources increasing the value of an information-centric network
   (perhaps) much faster than Metcalfe's law.

   For example, Jacobson et al. [CBIS] argue that in ICN the "where and
   how" to obtain information are new degrees of freedom.  They
   illustrate this with a scenario involving a photo sharing application

   which takes advantage of whichever access network connectivity is
   available at the moment (WLAN, Bluetooth, and even SMS) without
   requiring a centralized infrastructure to synchronize between
   numerous devices.  It is important to highlight that since the focus
   of the communication changes, keep-alives in this scenario are simply
   unnecessary, as devices participating in the testbed network
   contribute resources in order to maintain user content consistency,
   not link state information as is the case in the host-centric
   paradigm.  This means that the notion of "infrastructure" may be
   completely different in the future. 

   Carofiglio et al., for instance, present early work on an analytical
   framework that attempts to capture the storage/bandwidth tradeoffs
   that ICN enables and can be used as foundation for a network planning
   tool [SHARE].  In addition, Chai et al. [CL4M] explore the benefits
   of ubiquitous caching throughout an information-centric network and
   argue that "caching less can actually achieve more."  These two
   papers indicate that there is a lot of work to be done in the area of
   how to use optimally all resources available to an information-
   centric network.

   Scenarios in this category, therefore, would cover the
   communication/computation/storage tradeoffs that an ICN deployment
   must consider, including network planning, perhaps capitalizing on
   user-provided resources, as well as operational and economical
   aspects to illustrate the superiority of ICN over other approaches,
   including federations of IP-based Content Distribution Networks
   (CDNs).


2.5  Content Dissemination

   Content dissemination has attracted more attention than other aspects
   of ICN, perhaps due to a misunderstanding of what the first "C" in
   CCN stands for.  Decentralized content dissemination with on-the-fly
   aggregation of information sources was envisaged in [N-Scen] where
   information objects can be dynamically assembled based on
   hierarchically structured subcomponents.  For example, a video stream
   could be associated with different audio streams and subtitle sets,
   which can all be obtained from different sources.  Using the topology
   depicted in Fig. 1 as an example, an application at C1 may end up
   obtaining, say, the video content from I1, but the user-selected
   subtitles from Px.  Semantics and content negotiation, on behalf of
   the user, were also considered, e.g. for the case of popular tunes
   which may be available in different encoding formats.  Effectively
   this scenario has the information consumer issuing independent
   requests for content based on information identifiers, and stitching
   the pieces together irrespective of "where" or "how" they were

   obtained.

   A case in point for content dissemination are vehicular ad-hoc
   networks (VANETs), as an ICN approach may address their needs for
   information dissemination between vehicles better than today's
   solutions.  VANETs, by nature, are characterized by intermittent
   connectivity, mobility, and the possibility to combine information
   from different sources as each vehicle does not care about "who"
   originated the named data objects.  Typical applications include road
   safety data and infotainment.  For example, Bai and Krishnamachari
   [EWC] take advantage of the localized and dynamic nature of a VANET
   to explore how a road congestion notification application can be
   implemented.  Wang et al. [DMND] consider data collection where Road-
   Site Units (RSUs) collect information from vehicles by broadcasting
   NDN-like INTEREST packets.  The proposed architecture is evaluated
   using simulation in a grid topology, and is compared against a host-
   centric alternative based on Mobile IP indicating high efficiency
   even at high speeds.

   Fig. 2 could apply to VANET scenarios where C0 represents a vehicle
   which can obtain named information objects via multiple wireless
   peers and/or RSUs (I2 and I3 in the figure).  Recently, Amadeo et al.
   [CRoWN] used a Manhattan grid in their evaluation of an ICN framework
   for VANETs on top of IEEE 802.11p.  The critical part of information
   dissemination in a VANET scenario revolves around "where" and "when".
    For instance, one may be interested in traffic conditions 2 km ahead
   while having no interest in similar information about the area around
   the path origin.  We argue that, due to the short sojourn time
   between a vehicle and the RSU and the short time of sustained
   connectivity between vehicles, VANET scenarios may provide fertile
   ground for showcasing the ICN advantage with respect to content
   dissemination especially when compared with current host-centric
   approaches.  That said, information integrity and filtering are
   challenges that must be addressed.

   Content dissemination scenarios, in general, have a large overlap
   with the scenarios described in the previous sections and are
   explored in several papers, such as [DONA] [PSI] [PSIMob] [NetInf]
   [CCN] [CBIS] [CCR], just to name a few.  In addition, Chai et al.
   present a hop-by-hop hierarchical content resolution approach
   [CURLING], which employs receiver-driven multicast over multiple
   domains, advocating another content dissemination approach.

   Scenarios in this category abound in the literature, including stored
   and streaming A/V distribution, file distribution, mirroring and bulk
   transfers, SVN-type of services, as well as traffic aggregation.  We
   expect that in particular for content dissemination both extreme as
   well as typical scenarios can be specified drawing data from current

   CDN deployments.


2.6  Network Interaction

   As ICN shifts the focus from nodes to information objects, the
   interaction between networks evolves to capitalize on data location
   independence, efficient and scalable in-network named object
   availability and multi-access functionality.  These interactions
   become critical in evaluating the technical and economic impact of
   ICN architecture choices, as noted in [ArgICN].  Additional
   challenges are presented by the emergence of new types of networks,
   such as Small Cell Networks (SCN), Heterogeneous Networks (HetNet),
   virtual and overlay networks.  Beyond simply adding diversity in
   deployment options, these networks have the potential to alter the
   incentives among existing, and future, we may add, network players,
   as noted in [EconICN].

   Moreover, such networks enable more numerous inter-network
   relationships where exchange of information may be conditioned on a
   set of multilateral policies.  For example, shared SCNs are emerging
   as a cost-effective way to address coverage of complex environments
   such as sports stadiums, large office buildings, malls, etc. [OptSC]
   [FEMTO].  Such networks are likely to be a complex mix of different
   cellular and WLAN access technologies (such as HSPA, LTE, and Wi-Fi)
   as well as ownership models.  It is reasonable to assume that access
   to content generated in such networks may depend on contextual
   information such as the subscription type, timing, and location of
   both the owner and requestor of the content.  The availability of
   such contextual information across diverse networks can lead to
   network inefficiencies and data management issues that can benefit
   from an information-centric approach.

   Jacobson et al. [CCN] include interactions between networks in their
   overall system design, and mention both "an edge-driven, bottom-up
   incentive structure" and techniques based on evolutions of existing
   mechanisms both for ICN router discovery by the end-user and for
   interconnecting between autonomous systems (AS).  For example, a BGP
   extension for domain-level content prefix advertisement can be used
   to enable efficient interconnection between AS's.  Liu et al. [MLDHT]
   proposed to address the "suffix-hole" issue found in prefix-based
   name aggregation through the use of a combination of bloom-filter
   based aggregation and multi-level DHT.

   Name aggregation has been discussed for a flat naming design as well
   in [NCOA], which also notes that based on estimations in [DONA] flat
   naming may not require aggregation.  This is a point that calls for
   further study.  Scenarios evaluating name aggregation, or lack

   thereof, should take into account the amount of state (e.g. size of
   routing tables) maintained in edge routers as well as network
   efficiency (e.g. amount of traffic generated).

   DiBenedetto et al. [RP-NDN] study policy knobs made available by NDN
   to network operators.  New policies, which are not feasible in the
   current Internet are described, including a "cache sharing peers"
   policy, where two peers have an incentive to share content cached in,
   but not originating from, their respective network.  The simple
   example used in the investigation considers several networks and
   associated transit costs, as shown in Fig. 3. (based on Fig. 1 of
   [RP-NDN]).  Agyapong and Sirbu [EconICN] further establish that ICN
   approaches should incorporate features that foster (new) business
   relationships.  For example, publishers should be able to indicate
   their willingness to partake in the caching market, proper reporting
   should be enabled to avoid fraud, and content should be made
   cacheable as much as possible to increase cache hit ratios.

   Business models and incentives are studied in [SAIL-A7] and [SAIL-
   A8], including scenarios where the access network provider (or a

   architecture based on similar principles; notably, it relies on a
   hierarchical DHT-based rendezvous interconnect.  Rajahalme et al.
   [PSIRP1] describe a rendezvous system using both a BGP-like routing
   protocol at the edge and a DHT-based overlay at the core.  Their
   evaluation model is centered around policy-compliant path stretch,
   latency introduced by overlay routing, caching efficacy, and overlay
   routing node load distribution.

   Figure 4.  Setup and operating costs of network entities

   Rajahalme et al. [ICCP] point out that ICN architectural changes may
   conflict with the current tier-based peering model.  For example,
   changes leading to shorter paths between ISPs are likely to meet
   resistance from Tier-1 ISPs.  Rajahalme [IDMcast] shows how
   incentives can help shape the design of specific ICN aspects, and in
   [IDArch] he presents a modeling approach to exploit these incentives,
   which includes a network model describing the relationship between AS
   based on data inferred from the current Internet, a traffic model
   taking into account business factors for each AS, and a routing model
   integrating the valley-free model and policy-compliance.  A typical
   scenario topology is illustrated in Fig. 5, redrawn here based on
   Fig. 1 of [ICCP].  Note that it relates well with the topology
   illustrated in Fig. 1 of this document.

   The evaluation of ICN architectures across multiple network types
   should include a combination of technical and economic aspects. 
   These scenarios aim to illustrate scalability, efficiency and
   manageability, as well as traditional and novel network policies.  
   Moreover, scenarios in this category should specifically address how
   different actors have proper incentives, not only in a pure ICN
   realm, but also during the migration phase towards this final state.

2.7  Energy Efficiency

   As mentioned earlier, energy efficiency can be tackled by different
   ICN approaches in ways that it cannot in a host-centric paradigm.  We
   already mentioned that in ICN perpetual connectivity is not
   necessary, therefore mechanisms that capitalize on powering down
   network interfaces are easier to accommodate.  For example, the work
   by Guan et al. [EECCN] indicates that CCN may be much more energy-
   efficient than traditional CDNs for delivering popular content given
   the current networking equipment energy consumption levels.  

   Evaluating energy efficiency does not require the definition of new
   scenarios, but does require the establishment of clear guidelines so
   that different ICN approaches can be compared not only in terms of
   scalability, for example, but also in terms to power consumption.

INTERNET DRAFT           ICN Baseline Scenarios           March 11, 2013


2.8  Delay and Disruption Tolerance

   Delay- and Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) [DTN] [DTNICN]
   originated as a means to extend the Internet to interplanetary
   communications.  However, it was subsequently found to be an
   appropriate architecture for many terrestrial situations as well. 
   Typically, this was where delays were greater than protocols such as
   TCP could handle, and where disruptions to communications were the
   norm rather than occasional annoyances.  DTN has now been applied to
   many situations, including opportunistic content sharing, handling
   infrastructural issues during emergency situations (e.g. earthquakes)
   and providing connectivity to remote rural areas without existing
   Internet provision and little or no communications or power
   infrastructure.

   The DTN architecture [RFC4838] is based on a "store, carry and
   forward" paradigm that has been applied extensively to situations
   where data is carried between network nodes by a "data mule", which
   carries bundles of data stored in some convenient storage medium
   (e.g., a USB memory stick).  With the advent of sensor and peer-to-
   peer (P2P) networks between mobile nodes, DTN is becoming a more
   commonplace type of networking than originally envisioned.  Since ICN
   also does not rely on the familiar end-to-end communications
   paradigm, there are, thus, clear synergies [DTN].  First, both
   approaches rely on in-network storage.  Second, both approaches
   espouse late binding of names to locations and, third, both
   approaches treat data as a long-term component that can exist in the
   network for extended periods of time.

   Through these similarities, it becomes possible to identify many DTN
   principles already in existence within ICN architectures.  For
   example, ICN nodes will often retain publications locally, making
   them accessible later on, much like DTN bundles do.  Consequently,
   these synergies suggest strong potential for marrying the two
   technologies.  This, for instance, could include building new
   integrated Information-Centric Delay Tolerant Network (ICDTN)
   protocols or, alternatively, building ICN schemes over existing DTN
   protocols (or vice versa).

   The above similarities suggest that integration of the two principles
   would be certainly feasible. Beyond this, there are also a number of
   direct benefits identifiable. Through caching and replication, ICN
   offers strong information resilience, whilst, through store-and-
   forward, DTN offers strong connectivity resilience. As such, both
   architectures could benefit greatly from each other. Initial steps
   have already been taken in the DTN community to integrate ICN
   principles, e.g. the Bundle Protocol Query Block [BPQ]. Whilst,
   similarly, initial steps have been taken in the ICN community too,

INTERNET DRAFT           ICN Baseline Scenarios           March 11, 2013


   such as [SLINKY].

   A key baseline scenario in this context is opportunistic content
   sharing.  This occurs when mobile nodes create opportunistic links
   between each other to share content of interest.  For example, this
   might occur on an underground train, in which people pass news items
   between their mobile phones.  Equally, content generated on the
   phones (e.g. tweets [TWIMIGHT]) could be stored for later forwarding
   (or even forwarded amongst interested passengers on the train).
   Another key example of what is essentially the same scenario is use
   in emergency and disaster situations where the local infrastructure
   has either been destroyed or is otherwise inaccessible to first
   responders.  Being able to exchange and cache information without the
   need for any installed infrastructure could greatly improve the
   effectiveness of emergency responders.  These kind of scenarios bode
   well with those introduced earlier in Section 2.4 about (re)defining
   what "infrastructure" may mean in practice in an information-centric
   network.

   Especially in the context of the scenarios discussed above, it is of
   clear interest to evaluate different ICN approaches with respect both
   to their delay- and disruption-tolerance, i.e., how effective is the
   approach when used in a delay tolerant network situation; and to
   their active support for operations in a DTN environment.  Important
   aspects to be evaluated in support of this application include, but
   are not limited to, name resolution, routing and forwarding in
   disconnected parts of the network; support for unidirectional links;
   number of round trips needed to complete a data transfer; efficiency
   in the face of disruption, and so on.

   To assist in this evaluation, within the DTN community, a number of
   important contact traces have emerged as de-facto evaluative tools.
   They include Haggle's INFOCOM traces and MIT's Reality Mining.
   Typically, these are used with the Opportunistic Network Environment
   (ONE) simulator [ONE] to evaluate the above types of metrics.  Based
   on this, and with proper extensions, a strong platform for evaluating
   the delay and disruption tolerance properties of different ICN
   approaches could be developed.


2.9  Internet of Things

   Advances in electronics miniaturization combined with low-power
   wireless access technologies (e.g., ZigBee, NFC, Bluetooth and
   others) have enabled the coupling of interconnected digital services
   with everyday objects.  As devices with sensors and actuators connect
   into the network, they become "smart objects" and form the foundation
   for the so-called Internet of Things (IoT).  IoT is expected to

INTERNET DRAFT           ICN Baseline Scenarios           March 11, 2013


   increase significantly the amount of content carried by the network
   due to machine-to-machine (M2M) communication as well as novel user
   interaction possibilities.

   Yet, the full potential of IoT does not lie on simple remote access
   to smart object data.  Instead, it is the intersection of Internet
   services with the physical world that will bring about the most
   dramatic changes.  Burke [IoTEx], for instance, makes a very good
   case for creating everyday experiences using interconnected things
   through participatory sensing applications.  In this case, inherent
   ICN capabilities for data discovery, caching, and trusted
   communication are leveraged to obtain sensor information and enable
   content exchange between mobile users, repositories, and
   applications.

   Kutscher and Farrell [IWMT] discuss the benefits that ICN can provide
   in these environments in terms of naming, caching, and optimized
   transport.  The Named Identifier scheme (ni) [NI] could be used for
   globally unique smart object identification, although an actual
   implementation report is not currently available.  Access to
   information generated by smart objects can be of varied nature and
   often vital for the correct operation of large systems.  As such,
   supporting timestamping, security, scalability, and flexibility need
   to be taken into account.

   Ghodsi et al. [NCOA] examine hierarchical and self-certifying naming
   schemes and point out that ensuring reliable and secure content
   naming and retrieval may pose stringent requirements (e.g., necessity
   for employing PKI), which can be too demanding for low-powered nodes,
   such as sensors.  That said, earlier work by Heidemann et al. [nWSN]
   shows that, for dense sensor network deployments, disassociating
   sensor naming from network topology and using named content at the
   lowest level of communication in combination with in-network
   processing of sensor data is feasible in practice and can be more
   efficient than employing a host-centric binding between node locator
   and the content existing therein.

   J. Burke et al. [NDNl] describe the implementation of a lighting
   control building automation system where the security, naming and
   device discovery NDN mechanisms are leveraged to provide
   configuration, installation and management of residential and
   industrial lighting control systems.  The goal is an inherently
   resilient system, where even smartphones can be used for control.
   Naming reflects fixtures with evolved identification and node
   reaching capabilities thus simplifying bootstrapping, discovery, and
   user interaction with nodes.  The authors report that this ICN-based
   system requires less maintenance and troubleshooting than typical IP-
   based alternatives.

   IoT exposes ICN concepts to a stringent set of requirements which are
   exacerbated by the amount of nodes, as well as by the type and volume
   of information that must be handled.  A way to address this is
   [IoTScope], which tackles the problem of mapping named information to
   an object, diverting from the currently typical centralized discovery
   services and leveraging the intrinsic ICN scalability capabilities
   for naming.  It extends the base [PURSUIT] design with
   hierarchically-based scopes, facilitating lookup, access, and
   modifications of only the part of the object information that the
   user is interested in.  Another important aspect is how to
   efficiently address resolution and location of the information
   objects, particularly when large numbers of nodes are connected, as
   in IoT deployments.  In [ICN-DHT], Katsaros et al. propose a
   Distributed Hash Table (DHT) which is compared with DONA [DONA]. 
   Their results show how topological routing information has a positive
   impact on resolution, at the expense of memory and processing
   overhead.

   ICN approaches, therefore, should be evaluated with respect to their
   capacity to handle the content produced and consumed by extremely
   large numbers of diverse devices.  IoT scenarios aim to exercise ICN
   deployment from different aspects, including ICN node design
   requirements, scalability, efficient naming, transport, and caching
   of time-restricted data.


2.10  Smart City

   The rapid increase in urbanization sets the stage for the most
   compelling and challenging environments for networking.  By 2050 the
   global population will reach nine billion people, 75% of which will
   dwell in urban areas.  In order to cope with this influx, many cities
   around the world started their transformation toward the Smart City
   vision.  Smart cities will be based on the following innovation axes:
   smart mobility, smart environment, smart people, smart living, and
   smart governance.  In development terms, the core goal of a smart
   city is to become a business-competitive and attractive environment,
   while serving citizen well being [CPG].

   In a smart city, ICT plays a leading role and acts as the glue
   bringing together all actors, services, resources (and their
   interrelationships), that the urban environment is willing to host
   and provide [MVM].  ICN appears particularly suitable for these
   scenarios.  Domains of interest include intelligent transportation
   systems, health care, A/V communications, peer-to-peer and
   collaborative platforms for citizens, social inclusion, active
   participation in public life, e-government, safety and security,
   sensor networks, and IoT.

INTERNET DRAFT           ICN Baseline Scenarios           March 11, 2013


   Nevertheless, the road to build a real information-centric digital
   ecosystem will be long and more coordinated effort is required to
   drive innovation in this domain.  We argue that smart city needs and
   ICN technologies can trigger a virtuous innovation cycle toward
   future ICT platforms.  Recent concrete ICN-based contributions have
   been formulated for home energy management [iHEMS], geo-localized
   services [ACC], smart city services [IB], and traffic information
   dissemination in vehicular scenarios [WAK].  Some of the proposed
   ICN-based solutions are implemented in real testbeds while others are
   evaluated through simulation.

   Zhang et al. [iHEMS] propose a secure publish-subscribe architecture
   for handling the communication requirements of Home Energy Management
   Systems (HEMS).  The objective is to safely and effectively collect
   measurement and status information from household elements, aggregate
   and analyze the data, and ultimately enable intelligent control
   decisions for actuation.  They consider a simple experimental test-
   bed for their proof-of-concept evaluation, exploiting open source
   code for the ICN implementation, and emulating some node
   functionality in order to facilitate system operation.

   A different scenario is considered in [ACC], where DHTs are employed 
   for distributed, scalable, and geographically-aware service lookup in
   a smart city.  Also in this case, the ICN application is validated by
   considering a small-scale testbed: a small number of nodes are
   realized with simple embedded PCs or specific hardware boards (e.g.,
   for some sensor nodes); other nodes realizing the network connecting
   the principal actors of the tests are emulated with workstations. 
   The proposal in [IB] draws from a smart city scenario (mainly
   oriented towards waste collection management) comprising sensors and
   moving vehicles, as well as a cloud computing system that supports
   data retrieval and storage operations.  The main aspects of this
   proposal are analyzed via simulation using open source code which is
   publicly available.  Some software applications are designed on real
   systems (e.g., PCs and smartphones).  Finally, Wang et al. [WAK]
   discuss the adoption of named data networking in vehicular (V2V)
   communication systems.  They validate their work using simulation
   based on a freely available network simulator but consider rather
   simple traffic patterns.

   Smart city scenarios aim to exercise several ICN aspects in an urban
   environment.  In particular, they can be useful to (i) analyze the
   capacity of using ICN for managing extremely large data sets; (ii)
   study ICN performance in terms of scalability in distributed
   services; (iii) verify the feasibility of ICN in a very complex
   application like vehicular communication systems; and (iv) examine
   the possible drawbacks related to privacy and security issues in
   complex networked environments.

3  Evaluation Methodology

   As we have seen in the previous section, different ICN approaches
   have already been evaluated in the peer-reviewed literature using a
   mixture of theoretical analysis, simulation studies, and empirical
   (testbed) measurements.  These are all popular techniques for
   evaluating network protocols, architectures, and services in the
   networking community.  Typically, researchers follow a specific
   methodology based on the goal of their experiment, e.g. whether they
   want to evaluate scalability, quantify resource utilization, analyze
   economic incentives, and so on, as we have discussed earlier.  In
   addition, though, we often observe that ease and convenience of
   setting up and running experiments can sometimes be a factor in
   published evaluations. 

   It is worth pointing out that for well-established protocols, such as
   TCP, for example, performance evaluation using actual network
   deployments has the benefit of realistic workloads and reflects the
   environment where the service or protocol will be deployed.  However,
   sometimes results obtained in this environment are often difficult to
   replicate independently.  Moreover, for ICN in particular, it is not
   yet clear what qualifies as a "realistic workload".  Trace-based
   analysis of ICN is at its infancy, and more work is needed towards
   defining characteristic workloads for ICN evaluation studies.

   This document recommends that attention must be paid while choosing
   the evaluation methodology as well as the experimental setup process.
    Numerous factors affect experimental results, including, for
   instance, the topology selected, the background traffic that an
   application is being subjected to, the available bandwidth, the link
   delay and loss-rate characteristics throughout the selected topology,
   the node mobility patterns, as well as practical aspects such as the
   diversity of devices used, and so on, as we explain in the remainder
   of this section.


3.1  ICN Simulators and Testbeds

   Since ICN is still an emerging area the community is still in the
   process of developing effective evaluation environments, including
   simulators emulators, and testbeds.  To date, none of the available
   simulators can be seen as the one and only reference evaluation tool.
    Furthermore, no single environment supports all well known ICN
   approaches.  Simulators and emulators should be able to capture
   faithfully all features and operations of the respective ICN
   architecture(s).  It is also essential that these tools and
   environments come with adequate logging facilities so that one can
   use them for in-depth analysis as well as debugging.  Additional

INTERNET DRAFT           ICN Baseline Scenarios           March 11, 2013


   requirements include the ability to support mid- to large-scale
   experiments, the ability to quickly and correctly set various
   configurations and parameters, as well as to support the playback of
   traffic traces captured on a real testbed or network.

   The rest of this subsection summarizes the ICN simulators and
   testbeds currently available to the community.


3.1.1  CCN and NDN

   ndnSIM is a module that can be plugged into the ns-3 simulator and
   supports the core features of CCN.  One can use ndnSIM to experiment
   with various CCN applications and services as well as components
   developed for CCN such as routing protocols, caching and forwarding
   strategies.  The code for ns-3 and ndnSIM is openly available to the
   community and can be used as the basis for implementing ICN protocols
   or applications.  For more details interested readers should consult
   http://www.nsnam.org and http://ndnsim.net.

   ccnSim [ccnSim] is another CCN-specific simulator that was specially
   designed to handle forwarding of a large number of CCN-chunks. 
   ccnSim is written in C++ for the OMNeT++ simulation framework; see
   http://www.omnetpp.org for more details.  Finally, a packet level
   simulator for CCN is the Content Centric Networking Packet Level
   Simulator [CCNPL]. 

   An example of a testbed that supports CCN is the Open Network Lab
   (see https://onl.wustl.edu/).  The ONL testbed currently comprises 18
   extensible gigabit routers and over a 100 computers representing
   clients and is freely available to the public for running CCN
   experiments.  Nodes in ONL are preloaded with CCNx software.  ONL
   provides a graphical user interface for easy configuration and
   testbed set up as per the experiment requirements, and also serves as
   a control mechanism, allowing access to various control variables and
   traffic counters.  It is also possible to run and evaluate CCN over
   popular testbeds such as PlanetLab (http://www.planet-lab.org/) and
   Deter (http://www.isi.deterlab.net) by directly running the CCNx
   open-source code on PlanetLab and Deter nodes, respectively.


3.1.2  Publish/Subscribe Internet Architecture

   The PSIRP project has open-sourced its Blackhawk publish-subscribe
   (Pub/Sub) implementation for FreeBSD; more details are available
   online at http://www.psirp.org/downloads.html.  Despite the
   limitation to one operating system, it also provides a virtual image
   to allow its deployment into other environments through

   virtualization.  The code distribution features a kernel module, a
   file system and scope daemon, as well as a set of tools and test
   applications and scripts.


3.1.3  NetInf

   The EU FP7 4WARD and SAIL projects have made a set of open-source
   implementations available; see http://www.netinf.org/open-source for
   more details.  Of note, two software packages are available.  The
   first one is a set of tools for NetInf implementing different aspects
   of the protocol (e.g., NetInf URI format, HTTP and UDP convergence
   layer) using different programming languages.  The Java
   implementation is a very rich one, providing as well a local caching
   proxy and client.  The second one, is a OpenNetInf prototype from the
   4WARD project.  Besides a rich set of NetInf mechanisms implemented,
   it also provides a browser plug in and video streaming software.


3.2  Topology Selection

   Section 2 introduced several topologies that have been used in ICN
   studies so far but, to date and to the best of our understanding,
   there is no single topology that can can be used to easily evaluate
   all aspects of the ICN paradigm.  There is rough consensus that the
   classic dumbbell topology cannot serve well future evaluations of ICN
   approaches.  Therefore, one should consider a range of topologies,
   each of which would stress different aspects, as outlined earlier in
   this document. 

   Besides defining the evaluation topology as a graph G = (V,E) where V
   is the set of vertices (nodes) and E is the set of edges (links), one
   should also clearly define and list the respective matrices that
   correspond to the network, storage and computation capacities
   available at each node as well as the delay characteristics of each
   link, so that the results obtained can be easily replicated in other
   studies.  Recent work by Hussain and Chen [Montage], although
   currently addressing host-centric networks, could also be leveraged
   and be extended by the ICN community.

   Finally, the topology dynamic aspects, such as node and content
   mobility, packet loss rates as well as link and node failure rates,
   to name a few, should also be carefully considered.  As mentioned in
   subsection 2.8, for example, contact traces from the DTN community
   could also be used in ICN evaluations.

3.3  Traffic Load 

   As we are still missing ICN-specific traffic workloads we can
   currently only extrapolate from today's workloads.  In this
   subsection we provide a first draft of a set of common guidelines, in
   the form of what we will refer to as a content catalog for different
   scenarios.  This catalog, which is based on previously published
   work, could be used to evaluate different ICN proposals, for example,
   on routing, congestion control, and performance, and can be
   considered as other kinds of ICN contributions emerge.

   We take scenarios from today's Web, file sharing (BitTorrent-like)
   and User Generated Content (UGC) platforms (e.g., YouTube), as well
   as Video on Demand (VoD) services.  The content catalog for each
   traffic is characterized by a specific set of parameters: the
   cardinality of the estimated content catalog, the average size of the
   exchanged contents (either chunks or entire named information
   objects), and the statistical distribution that best reflect the
   popularity of objects and their request frequency.  Table I
   summarizes the content catalog.  With this shared point of reference,
   the use of the same set of parameters (depending on the scenario of
   interest) among researchers will be eased, and different proposals
   could be compared on a common base.

   Table I. Content catalog

   Traffic | Catalog |  Mean Object Size  |  Popularity Distribution
    Load   |  Size   |  [L4][L5][L7][L8]  |  [L3][L5][L6][L11][L12]
           | [L1][L2]|  [L9][L10]         |
           | [L3][L5]|                    |
   ====================================================================
   Web     |  10^12  | Chunk: 1-10 kB     | Zipf, 0.64 <= alpha <= 0.83 
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   File    | 5x10^6  | Chunk: 250-4096 kB | Zipf, 0.75 <= alpha<= 0.82
   sharing |         | Object: ~800 MB    |
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   UGC     |  10^8   | Object: ~10 MB     | Zipf, alpha >= 2
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   VoD     |  10^4   | Object: ~100 MB    | Zipf, 0.65 <= alpha <= 1
   ====================================================================

   * UGC = User Generated Content ** VoD = Video on Demand 

   Several studies in the past years have stated that Zipf's law is the
   discrete distribution that best represents the request frequency in a
   number of application scenarios, ranging from the Web to VoD
   services.  The key aspect of this distribution is that the frequency
   of a content request is inversely proportional to the rank of the

INTERNET DRAFT           ICN Baseline Scenarios           March 11, 2013


   content itself, i.e., the smaller the rank, the higher the request
   frequency.  If we denote with M the content catalog cardinality and
   with 1 <= i <= M the rank of the i-th most popular content, we can
   express the probability of requesting the content with rank "i" as:

   P(X=i) = ( 1/i^(alpha) ) / C, with C = SUM(1 / j^(alpha)), alpha > 0

   where the sum is obtained considering all values of j, 1 <= j <= M.


3.4  Choosing Relevant Metrics

   Depending on the type of evaluation and the focal area of interest,
   e.g. name resolution vs. routing efficiency vs. congestion control
   and fair sharing of resources vs. QoS for A/V communications, the
   metrics that are of prime importance may vary.  That said, we should
   in general consider two broad categories: traffic-related metrics and
   system metrics.


3.4.1  Traffic Metrics

   From the ICN application point of view, relevant metrics include
   goodput (i.e. the application payload divided by the time needed to
   deliver it) and delay, as well as more detailed quality of service
   (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) metrics.  Typical QoS/QoE
   metrics for A/V applications include Peak Signal to Noise Ratio
   (PSNR), R and Mean Opinion Scores (MOS), and others from the
   standardized A/V evaluation toolbox. 

   From the network point of view, relevant metrics include resource
   efficiency and control plane overhead, among others.


3.4.2  System Metrics

   Overall system metrics that need to be considered include
   reliability, scalability, energy efficiency, and delay and
   disconnection tolerance.  In deployments where ICN is addressing
   specific scenarios, system metrics could be derived from current
   experience.  For example, in IoT scenarios, which were discussed
   earlier in subsection 2.9, it is reasonable to consider the current
   generation of sensor nodes, sources of information, and even
   measurement gateways (e.g., for smart metering at homes) or
   smartphones.  In this case, ICN operation ought to be evaluated with
   respect not only to overall scalability and network efficiency, but
   also the impact on the nodes themselves.  Karnouskos et al.
   [SensReqs] provide a comprehensive set of sensor and IoT-related
 


Pentikousis & Ohlman   Expires September 12, 2013              [Page 24]

INTERNET DRAFT           ICN Baseline Scenarios           March 11, 2013


   requirements, for example, which include aspects such as resource
   utilization, service life-cycle management and device management.

   Conversely, ther specific metrics are also risen in such stringent
   environments, such as CPU processing requirements, signaling
   overhead, and memory allocation for caching procedures. Also, in
   nodes acting as gateways, which typically not only act as point of
   service to a large number of nodes, but also have to satisfy the
   information requests from remote entities, need to consider
   scalability-related metrics, such as frequency and processing of
   successfully satisfied information requests.


3.5  Resource Equivalence and Tradeoffs

   As we have seen above, every ICN network is built from a set of
   resources, which include link capacities, different types of memory
   structures and repositories used for storing named information
   objects and chunks temporarily (i.e. caching) or persistently, as
   well as name resolution and other lookup services.  Complexity and
   processing needs in terms of forwarding decisions, management (e.g.
   need for manual configuration, explicit garbage collection, and so
   on), and routing (i.e. amount of state needed, need for manual
   configuration of routing tables, support for mobility, etc.) set the
   stage for a range of engineering tradeoffs.

   In order to be able to compare different ICN approaches it would be
   beneficial to be able to define equivalence in terms of different
   resources which today are considered incomparable.  For example,
   would provisioning an additional 5 Mb/s link capacity lead to better
   performance than adding 100 GB of in-network storage?  Within this
   context one would consider resource equivalence (and the associated
   tradeoffs) for example for cache hit ratios per GB of cache,
   forwarding decision times, CPU cycles per forwarding decision, and so
   on.
