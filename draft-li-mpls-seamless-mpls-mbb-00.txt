   core/aggregation networks into a single MPLS domain.  It provides a
   highly flexible and a scalable architecture and the possibility to
   integrate 100.000 of nodes.  One of the key elements of Seamless MPLS
   is the separation of the service and transport plane: it can reduce
   the service specific configurations in network transport node.

   The main purpose of Seamless MPLS is to deal with the integration of
   access networks and core/aggregation networks.  The typical access
   devices taken into account are DSLAM(Digital Subscriber Link Access
   Multiplexer), etc.  Now the mobile backhaul service has been deployed
   widely, the requirement of the integration of mobile backhaul
   networks and core networks has been proposed.  Though some approaches
   of Seamless MPLS can be reused for the integration, there has to be
   some new issues to be dealt with when integrate these networks based
   on MPLS technologies.

   This document describes new requirements and solutions for Seamless
   MPLS to extend the core domain to integrate the mobile backhaul
   networks.  It can enable a flexible deployment of an end to end
   mobile backhaul service delivery.  Though the Seamless MPLS approach
   for the integration of the core network and the mobile network tries
   to use existing and well known protocols, some new features or
   protocol extensions have to be introduced for the integrated network
   to provide the unified service.

   Currently, this document focuses on end to end unicast LSP.
   Multicast will be described in the future version.

3.  Scenarios

   Existing mobile backhaul networks have different topology and network
   architectures composed by devices with variable capability . Seamless
   MPLS should be able to adapt to different scenarios to support the
   integration of mobile backhaul networks.

3.1.  Scenarios for Network Architecture

   Mobile backhaul networks are usually built using hierarchical network
   structure with access network, aggregation network and core network.
   These networks are always separated by AS or IGP area.  Along with
   the progress of network integration, the integration network can be
   summarized as following scenarios.

   Network Architecture 1: Network separated by ASes

   In current networks it is common that the core network and the mobile
   backhaul network have different AS numbers.  The core network usually
   uses a public AS number for internet connection.  On the other hand
   the mobile backhaul network including access network and aggregation
   network usually uses a private AS number just for local services.  So
   the integrated end-to-end service means to across different ASes.

   Scenario 1: ASes connected by different ASBRs

   This is the most common scenario.  In this scenario there are
   redundant ASBRs in each AS to connect with the other AS back to back.

              Figure 1 Redundant ASBRs connected Back to Back


   The transport layer of Seamless MPLS for this scenario is the same as
   the Option C Inter-AS VPN scenario defined by [RFC4364].  In this
   scenario, Seamless MPLS uses label distribution enabled IBGP and EBGP
   to establish the end-to-end BGP LSP to support services (using IPv4
   as the example).

   o  IBGP distributes the PE's 32/ route to ASBRs in source AS (P
      devices need not know the PE's 32/ route).

   o  EBGP redistributes labeled IPv4 routes from source AS to
      neighboring AS.

   o  IBGP distributes the PE's 32/ route from ASBRs to ingress PEs in
      target AS.

   Scenario 2: ASes connected by integrated ASBRs

   In this scenario there are still redundant ASBRs in each AS.  But
   these ASBRs integrates together to reduce a pair of devices.  This
   scenario can effectively reduce the number of devices and costs.
   Other devices in each AS such as PEs and Ps need not be impacted.

                         Figure 2 Integrated ASBRs


   The transport layer of Seamless MPLS for this scenario is similar
   with the network architecture 1 (using IPv4 as the example).

   o  The same in each AS domain.  Still use IBGP to distribute the PE's
      32/ routes.

   o  The integrated ASBR should support two different ASes and can
      redistribute the labeled IPv4 routes from one AS to neighboring
      AS.

   Network Architecture 2: Different network integrated in one AS but
   separated by different IGP areas

   This scenario is far different from most of current mobile backhaul
   networks.  Core network is deployed in a same AS with access/
   aggregation network.  The core network, aggregation network and
   access network are just separated by IGP areas for scalability.

   In this scenario, Seamless MPLS uses labeled IBGP to establish the
   end-to-end BGP LSP to support services.

3.2.  Scenarios for Different Edge of Labeled BGP

   Devices in existing mobile backhaul networks vary in capacity.
   Labeled BGP capability may not be able to be supported by all
   devices, especially by lower level nodes in access network.  Seamless
   MPLS based on labeled BGP technology should adapt to different
   situations.  Based on the location of the edge of labeled BGP, there
   should be three possible scenarios.

   Scenario 1: Cell Site/User PE devices as the edge of labeled BGP

   The transport layer in this scenario should be totally end-to-end BGP
   LSP.  The scenario requires the ingress PE(access devices) to
   encapsulate a three-label stack on the packet.  This requirement
   maybe difficult to be satisfied by all kinds of access devices,
   especially access devices with very low capacity.

   Scenario 2: ASG nodes as the edge of labeled BGP

   In this scenario, access nodes(PEs) directly connected with eNodeB
   can not support labeled BGP.  Access nodes only support basic MPLS
   functionality with basic route functionality using static or default
   routes.  ASG devices should stitch MPLS LDP/TE LSP in access network
   and BGP LSP in aggregation/core network to support end-to-end
   services.

4.  Requirements and Solutions

4.1.  Overall

   The typical mobile backhaul network is shown in the figure 1.  It
   usually adopts ring topology to save fiber resource and it is divided
   into the aggregate network and the access network.  Cell Site
   Gateways(CSGs) connects the eNodeBs and RNC Site Gateways(RSGs)
   connects the RNCs.  The mobile traffic is transported from CSGs to
   RSGs.

   Seamless MPLS [I-D.ietf-mpls-seamless-mpls] defines the possible
   requirements for the integration of the access network and the
   aggregation/core network.  In the mobile backhaul network, being
   different from the typical access devices(DSLAM, MSAN), CSGs and RSGs
   of the mobile backhaul network needs to support rich MPLS features
   such as path design, protection switch, OAM, etc., to provide SDH-
   like service.  On the other hand, CSGs have the same scalability
   limitations as access devices.  Seamless MPLS for mobile backhaul has
   to take into account the difference and the similarity and new
   requirements are proposed.

Internet-Draft      Seamless MPLS for Mobile Backhaul          July 2013


   1.  Requirements on MPLS TE

   In the mobile backhaul network, in order to provide SDH-like service,
   MPLS TE or MPLS TP technologies are always introduced besides MPLS
   LDP.  When integrate the core network and the mobile backhaul
   network, the interworking between IGP/BGP and RSVP-TE is inevitable.
   There are following requirements:

   -- Proxy Egress LSP and BGP LSP Stitching: When the end-to-end LSP
   setup in the Seamless MPLS domain, MPLS TE LSP in the mobile backhaul
   should be stitched with the BGP LSP in the core network.  In
   addition, since the end-to-end MPLS TE LSP cannot setup spanning
   multiple areas, the proxy egress RSVP-TE LSP should be able to setup
   in the mobile backhaul network.

   -- OAM: There are complete OAM solutions for MPLS TE/MPLS-TP
   including fault management(FM) and performance monitoring(PM).  For
   IGP/BGP, the OAM mechanism, especially the performance monitoring
   mechanism is not enough.  Thus the end-to-end OAM for the mobile
   backhaul service can not be provided.  The Seamless MPLS architecture
   should propose unified OAM mechanisms to satisfy the requirements of
   the end-to-end services.

   -- Protection: The protection switch mechanism has been provided in
   the mobile backhaul network to achieve convergence in 50ms.  When
   integrate the core network, the end-to-end convergence in 50 ms
   should be guaranteed.

   -- Scalability: Comparing with MPLS LDP, there exists more
   scalability issues for MPLS TE.  Though the network scale can be
   controlled by dividing the network into multiple IGP areas in the
   Seamless MPLS domain, there is more complex configuration for MPLS TE
   than MPLS LDP since the rich MPLS TE properties should be specified.
   The provision issue has much negative effect on the scalability of
   MPLS-TE-based network.

   2.  Requirements on Ring Network

   In mobile backhaul network, CSGs always access the ring network.  The
   approaches proposed in the [I-D.ietf-mpls-seamless-mpls] face
   challenges in the ring network.

   -- LDP DoD: There exists multiple nodes from a CSG to an ASG in the
   ring network.  This means label request messages and label mapping
   messages should be sent through multiple nodes for LDP DoD.  If
   static routes are used, there are a great deal of routes which should
   be configured statically in the network.  This provision is hard to
   be accepted by the service provider.

Internet-Draft      Seamless MPLS for Mobile Backhaul          July 2013


   -- LFA(Loop Free Alternate): The route loop will be bound to happen
   in the ring network.  This means that the backup route does not exist
   in specific nodes of the ring network according to LFA.  If LDP is
   used and convergence in 50 ms must be guaranteed for the mobile
   backhaul service, the new FRR solution must be proposed to cover the
   whole network.

   3.  Requirements on L3VPN

   FMC( Fixed Mobile Convergence ) is being taken into account for the
   mobile backhaul network.  In order to achieve higher scalability,
   L3VPN is provisioned to bear the mobile backhaul service besides PW.
   There are following requirements:

   -- Policy control: The routes in the L3VPN can be advertised in a
   larger scope comparing with the point-to-point PW setup in the L2VPN.
   Considering the limited capability of the access devices (CSGs),
   complex policy control on route advertisement has to be introduced.
   This cause the provision becomes complex and error-prone.
   Simplifying the policy control is mandatory in the Seamless MPLS
   domain.

   -- L3VPN OAM: There exists mature OAM mechanism based on PW for
   L2VPN.  The similar mechanism should be provided for the L3VPN to
   satisfy the SDH-like OAM requirement for the mobile backhaul service.

4.2.  Scalability

   [I-D.li-mpls-serv-driven-co-lsp-fmwk] describes the massive
   configuration issue for MPLS TE.  As the mobile backhaul service
   develops and the network scale expands, more and more LTE eNodeBs and
   associated Cell Site Gateways(CSGs) are added in the networks to
   connect the RNCs and associated RNC site gateways(RSGs).  This
   proposes the requirement of a great deal of MPLS TE tunnels which
   connect CSGs and RSGs.  Calculated using the typical MPLS TE tunnel
   configuration, there will be hundreds of thousands of command lines
   need to be configured for MPLS TE.  In addition, the return path
   issue for BFD for LSP will deteriorate the configuration work since
   the configuration is necessary to guarantee the return the path is
   the same as the forward path for MPLS TE tunnels.  Comparing with
   LDP, the provision work for MPLS TE is time-consuming and error-prone
   which has much negative effect on the scalability.  When Seamless
   MPLS is applied to the mobile backhaul network, the scalability of
   MPLS TE must be improved by effective solutions.

4.2.1.  Auto Mesh and Enhancement

Internet-Draft      Seamless MPLS for Mobile Backhaul          July 2013


   [RFC4972] proposes an automatic discovery mechanism to discover the
   set of LSR members of a mesh in order to automate the creation of
   mesh of TE LSPs.  Through Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) routing
   extensions, the LSRs members of a specific mesh can be discovered.
   Then the LSR can trigger setup of MPLS TE tunnels to other LSRs of
   the same mesh.  [I-D.li-ccamp-role-based-automesh] proposes the
   optimization for the auto mesh mechanism.  In some application
   scenarios, it is not necessary to setup full mesh MPLS TE tunnels.
   The optimized auto mesh mechanism is to not only advertise the
   membership of a mesh, but also advertise the role of the member.
   Thus the MPLS TE tunnel can setup based on both the membership and
   the role.  It can save the unnecessary setup of MPLS TE tunnels.

4.2.2.  Service-Driven Tunnel

   [I-D.li-mpls-serv-driven-co-lsp-fmwk] proposes the service-driven
   mechanism and framework for setup of MPLS TE tunnels.  LDP LSP has
   advantage over MPLS TE in scalability since LDP LSP setup is
   topology-driven which is a scalable way to adapt to the large-scale
   network.  On the other hand, MPLS TE LSP is always setup to bear
   specific services such as L3VPN and L2VPN.  That is, MPLS TE LSPs
   will not be setup aimlessly which is always inevitable for MPLS
   topology-driven LSP if there is no policy exerted on it.  So the
   service-driven mechanism is proposed to trigger MPLS TE LSP setup
   automatically by the service instead of explicitly configuring each
   tunnel and its traffic engineering attributes.  The service-driven
   method also has much advantage in the process of setting up co-routed
   TE LSPs.  The mobile backhaul service transported by MPLS TE LSPs is
   always bi-directional.  The characteristic can be utilized to setup
   the forward MPLS TE LSP and the co-routed reverse MPLS TE LSP.  The
   details of the procedures can refer to
   [I-D.li-mpls-serv-driven-co-lsp-fmwk].

4.2.3.  Auto Path Computation

   No matter the auto mesh mechanism or the service-driven mechanism is
   used to automate the creation of MPLS TE LSPs, several set of MPLS TE
   properties need to be specified for these MPLS TE tunnels.  If a
   group of tunnels can share one set of MPLS TE properties, they can be
   triggered to setup automatically.  On the contrary, if there are
   distinct MPLS TE properties for MPLS TE tunnels, the configuration
   work can not be saved since even if the auto tunnel mechanism is
   adopted the MPLS TE properties has to be configured for each tunnel
   which is like the current explicit configuring of traffic engineering
   properties of a tunnel.  For MPLS TE, the explicit path is such a
   tough thing which can have negative effect on the auto tunnel
   mechanism.  [I-D.li-ospf-auto-mbb-te-path] describes the scenarios of
   the mobile backhaul service in which the explicit path has to be

   used.  Accordingly TA (TE Area) and TL(TE Layer) are introduced for
   the design of MPLS TE network view.  Thus less MPLS TE properties
   need to be specified for MPLS TE tunnels and automation of path
   computation can be improved.  As a result the auto tunnel mechanism
   can be applied to improve the scalability of MPLS TE.

4.3.  Access Stitching

   To reduce the requirement on lower level network devices( access
   nodes/ ASG nodes, etc.) and keep these devices as simple as possible,
   the MPLS stitching technology should be deployed at the edge of
   labeled BGP nodes.  Thus nodes under the stitching points just need
   to support basic MPLS function with IGP or even just static routes.
   The position of the stitching point has been discussed in section
   3.2.  This section introduces the stitching solutions.

   1.  Transport layer stitching.  This kind of stitching technology
       ensures the transport LSP can setup end to end.  The service is
       just to deploy at the end points and the transit nodes in network
       need not perceive services.

   2.  Service layer stitching.  This kind of stitching technology
       establishes a hierarchical service end to end.  This technology
       can reduce the load of service session on access nodes.  But the
       stitching nodes need to perceive services.

4.3.1.  Transport Layer Stitching

   Transport layer stitching technology can stitch multi-segment
   transport LSPs together to establish an end-to-end LSP.

4.3.1.1.  Proxy TE

   In mobile backhaul network MPLS TE has been adopted to provide SDH-
   like service.  When the end-to-end LSP setup in the Seamless MPLS
   domain, MPLS TE LSP in the mobile backhaul network should be stitched
   with the BGP LSP in the core network.  [I-D.li-mpls-proxy-te-lsp]
   proposes the solution to setup proxy egress LSP by RSVP-TE.  When
   setup such LSP, there are two addresses will be carried by RSVP-TE
   Path/Resv messages: the actual destination address and the proxy node
   address.  RSVP-TE Path message will be sent along the path to the
   proxy node instead of the actual destination node.  When Path
   messages arrives at the proxy node, it will send back Resv message to
   allocate label and reserve resource.  The proxy node can use the
   actual destination address advertised by the Path message to stitch
   with BGP LSP.  With Proxy TE, the path for the LSP is calculated with
   the proxy node as the destination instead of its actual destination.
   So the MPLS TE information related with the path to the actual

Internet-Draft      Seamless MPLS for Mobile Backhaul          July 2013


   destination is not necessary to flood in the mobile backhaul network.
   This reduces the state maintenance and process burden of access
   nodes.

4.3.1.2.  Proxy LDP DoD

   If LDP DoD is adopted for Seamless MPLS in the mobile haul network,
   since there are multiple hops from the CSG to ASG or RSG, it is
   troublesome to configure static routes to a specific destination on
   all nodes.  Like Proxy TE, LDP can also setup proxy egress LSP by
   specifying the proxy node.  When setup such LSP, there are two
   addresses will be carried by LDP Label Request/Label Mapping
   messages: the actual destination address and the proxy node address.
   LDP Label Request message will be sent along the path to the proxy
   node instead of the actual destination node.  When Label Request
   messages arrives at the proxy node, it will sent back Label Mapping
   message to allocate label.  The proxy node can use the actual
   destination address advertised by the Label Request message to stitch
   with BGP LSP.  With Proxy LDP, the route for the proxy node will be
   used to setup LSP for the actual destination.  So the static routes
   for the actual destination are not necessary in the mobile backhaul
   network.  This reduces the route number and process burden of access
   nodes.

4.3.2.  Service Layer Stitching technology

   There is another stitching technology, which is not only just
   stitching transport layer but also stitching the service layer to
   help establish services across different domains.  Service layer
   stitching technology should coexist with common services in an MPLS
   network.

              Figure 8 Architecture of Service Layer Stitching


   The general architecture of service layer stitching is shown in
   figure 8.  The service stitching technologies are related with
   different service types.

4.3.2.1.  L3 Service Stitching - Hierarchy of VPN (HoVPN)

   Hierarchy of VPN (HoVPN) can stitching two segment VPN in one domain
   together to establish a VPN service across different domains and
   simplify the process of access devices (AN/CSG).

   1.  Process of Control Plane

   o  UPEs provide the access service for users.  These UPEs act as CSG/
      AN to maintain the VPNv4 routes of the directly connected VPN
      sites and just default VPNv4 routes advertised from SPEs.  For
      transport layer UPEs just maintain LSPs to SPEs instead of
      establishing Hierarchical LSPs to all remote PEs.  For service
      layer UPEs just establish VPNv4 MP-BGP session with SPEs instead
      of establishing them with all remote PEs.

   o  SPEs maintain all VPNv4 routes of the VPN sites connected through
      the UPEs and PEs, including the routes from the local and the
      remote sites.  Instead of advertising routes from the remote sites
      to the UPEs, the SPE only advertises the default route carrying
      label to the UPEs for the specific VPN instance.  SPEs establish
      hierarchy LSPs through labeled BGP to all other PEs and basic LSPs
      /CR-LSPs through MPLS LDP/RSVP-TE to UPEs.

   2.  Process of Forwarding Plane

   o  UPEs stack two layer labels for packets to SPEs.  The bottom label
      is assigned by the SPE and it is associated with the default route
      in a particular VRF.  The top label is assigned by the UPE's IGP
      Next Hop, which is associated with to the /32 route to the SPE.

   o  When packets from UPEs arrive at SPEs, the bottom label associated
      with the default route in a particular VRF will introduce the
      packet to loop up the forwarding entry in corresponding VRF.  SPEs
      would send packets to remote PEs with three layer label stack.
      SPEs will swap the bottom label to a new bottom label which is

      assigned by remote PE.  The middle label is assigned by the ASBR,
      which is associated with the /32 route to the remote PE.  The top
      label is assigned by the SPE's IGP Next Hop, corresponding to the
      /32 route to the ASBR.

   In HoVPN, since the SPE will only advertise the label binding with
   the default route for a specific VRF to the UPE, it can greatly
   reduce the route load and the process burden in the UPE.

4.3.2.2.  L2VPN Service stitching- Multi-Segment PW

   Multi-Segment PW(MS-PW) can stitching two segment PW in one domain
   together to establish an end-to-en PW across different domains.  With
   MS-PW, it is not necessary to setup LDP remote sessions among the
   UPEs and the remote PEs.  It is just to setup LDP remote session
   among UPEs and SPEs.  Thus it can reduce the load and the process
   burden proposed by LDP remote sessions.

   1.  Process of Control Plane

   o  UPEs provide the access service for users.  These UPEs act as CSG/
      AN to establish LDP remote sessions with SPEs instead of
      establishing sessions with all remote PEs.

   o  SPEs establish SS-PW(Single-Segment PW) with UPEs and remote PEs
      and stitching(switch) these two SS-PW together to establish
      hierarchy PW services across different domains.

   2.  Process of Forwarding Plane

   The detail of process of the forwarding plane refers to
   [I-D.ietf-pwe3-ms-pw-requirements].

4.4.  Reliability

4.4.1.  MRT FRR based on LDP MT

   [I-D.li-rtgwg-ldp-mt-mrt-frr] describes the scenarios of LDP Multi-
   topology(MT) for unicast fast-reroute using Maximally Redundant
   Trees(MRT).  MRT FRR can provide 100% coverage for fast-reroute of
   unicast traffic and LDP multi-topology has been proposed to provide
   multi-topology-based unicast forwarding in the architecture.
   Combining MRT FRR and LDP MT can be easy to achieve the object of
   high reliability in IGP/LDP networks.  Ring topology has been widely
   adopted in mobile backhaul networks.  The route loop will be bound to
   happen in the ring network and the existing LFA technology cannot
   cover the whole network to implement fast reroute functionality.  MRT
   FRR based on LDP MT can be adopted in the mobile backhaul network

   using LDP to provide 100% coverage for fast-reroute.  And the
   solution can also be deployed uniformly in the core network using LDP
   to achieve high scalability.

4.5.  Policy Control

   BGP as a route protocol for inter-AS now is used for Seamless MPLS to
   establish end-to-end hierarchical LSP or deploy VPN services.  BGP
   route policy based on IP-Prefix or communities are usually used to
   control the path.  The design and configuration is complex and error-
   prone.  In fact, BGP in Seamless MPLS is used to propagate labeled
   BGP routes across different domains to implement network convergence.
   This means several contiguous BGP networks are under the uniform
   administration.  It is not like the traditional BGP networks which
   may be under the administration of different service providers.  In
   this cases, thinking on the security of the network can be reduced.
   On the contrary, when advertise routes in the Seamless MPLS domain,
   it is desirable for BGP to carry more information to help select
   routing more intelligently.  It can reduce the cost proposed by
   complex policy control design and be able to adapt to network change
   easily.

4.6.  OAM

   Mobile Backhaul is a sensitive network on latency timer, packet loss
   rate, performance and so on.  Therefore, unified OAM mechanism is
   necessary to ensure the end-to-end network management including fault
   and performance management.

   OAM mechanisms is complete and mature for L2VPN and MAC services.
   However, L3VPN are introduced in the mobile backhaul network for
   better scalability.  The OAM mechanisms for IP and L3VPN is not
   sufficient to satisfy the OAM requirement of the mobile service,
   especially for performance monitoring.  On the other hand, the
   Seamless MPLS is in fact composed by multiple contiguous networks.
   More convenient mechanisms should be introduced for maintenance of
   the end-to-end path.

4.6.1.  L3VPN PM

   FMC becomes the requirement of mobile backhaul network and L3VPN is
   introduced to get better scalability for service provisioning.
   Unlike existing mature OAM mechanism based on PW for L2VPN, L3VPN
   lacks of similar mechanisms to satisfy the SDH-like OAM requirement
   for the mobile backhaul service.  [I-D.zheng-l3vpn-pm-analysis]
   analyzes the difficulty to implement performance monitoring for L3VPN
   owing to its MP2P or MP2MP service models.
   [I-D.dong-l3vpn-pm-framework] proposes the framework to implement

   L3VPN PM.  The point-to-point connection between two VRFs, called as
   VRF-to-VRF tunnel, is established.  Thus the existing MPLS OAM
   mechanisms based on P2P LSP models can be reused for L3VPN.

4.6.2.  IPFPM (IP Flow Performance Measurement)

   It is lack of effective performance monitoring mechanisms for IP-
   based mobile service.  The existing PM mechanism can not guarantee
   that the path of the injected OAM packets is same with the real
   traffic.  If out-of-order arrival of packets happens, the accuracy of
   the measurement result will be affected negatively for the IP
   service.

   [I-D.chen-coloring-based-ipfpm-framework] defines a new performance
   measurement mechanism for Service Level Agreement (SLA) verification
   and trouble shooting (e.g., fault localization or fault delimitation)
   named as IP Flow Performance Measurement (IPFPM).  This measurement
   mechanism can measure performance based on 5-tuple encapsulation
   information of IP flow without injecting any extra OAM packet to the
   flow.  The accuracy of the measurement result can be guaranteed even
   if out-of-order arrival of packets happens by setting one unused bit
   of the IP header of packets to "color" the packets into different
   color blocks.  The solution can adapt to various IP based network
   architecture (pure IP, L3VPN, etc.)

4.6.3.  Service Path Visualization

   Seamless MPLS provides an architecture to support end-to-end services
   across multi-separated IP/MPLS domains.  Existing path detect
   technologies (e.g. IP/LSP Ping and Trace) can only trace the path in
   different layers or different network segments.  So it is ineffective
   to get the end-to-end path combing these technologies for maintenance
   of the network.  On the other hand, existing technologies do not
   encapsulate the same 5-tuple {source IP address, destination IP
   address, source port number, destination port number, IP protocol
   number} as the real traffic.  This means the path maybe be different
   between the OAM packets and the real flow's packets when there are
   more than one outgoing paths and the forwarding decision is
   determined by hash based on 5-tuple information in the IP packet.
   According to these new requirements, the new solution should be
   introduced to maintain the end-to-end path more conveniently.
