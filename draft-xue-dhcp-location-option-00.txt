    DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 options for Access Point Location Information
                   draft-xue-dhcp-location-option-00

Abstract

   This document introduces Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access
   Points Wireless Termination Point information transported using DHCP.
   In this procedure, DHCP snooping is deployed on the Wireless
   Termination Point node or Access Controller node.  Then the Wireless
   Termination Point information can be inserted into the DHCP message
   in extension option.  Because the DHCP messages is send out from the
   subscriber, so binding between Wireless Termination Point information
   and subscriber is set up after this procedure.  Then Gateway obtains
   the Wireless Termination Point information through the subscriber
   access network.

1.  Introduction

   WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) features low cost and flexible,
   and even high speed wireless data access with open spectrum.  So it
   is becoming very popular these years.  Especially, it is a general
   case that WLAN is used to supplement cellular (2G/3G/LTE) network.
   It provides a good chance for operators to provide broadband service
   with less CAPEX.

   Traditionally, the WLAN consists of WTP and AC device as optional.
   WTP is the physical or logical network entity that contains an RF
   antenna and wireless physical layer (PHY) to transmit and receive
   station traffic for wireless access networks, and then transmit the
   packet to the wireline network.  It works as media converter in this
   point.  There are two types to WTP in exiting network, defined as
   standalone WTP and controlled WTP.  The standalone WTP refers to the
   WTP in autonomous WLAN architecture.  WTP is responsible for all WLAN
   functionality, such as encryption/decryption, authentication, etc.
   Instead, controlled WTP refers to the WTP in centralized WLAN
   architecture.  In that case, WTP management and subscriber
   authentication is implemented on AC device.

   It is possible that AC in the existing network isn't intelligent
   enough to aggregate all the WLAN critical functions in one, because
   the AC device is always enterprise device instead of carrier device.
   It is costly in large-scale deployment the software and hardware
   upgrade risks for carriers.  So it is a popular scenario to split the
   authentication function from AC to Service Gateway, which is the
   existing authentication gateway for other service, such as PPP, etc.
   This enables a better environment that diminishes the software and
   hardware upgrade for operators, shown in figure 1.

   However, if the authentication moved out from the AC, some issues
   arise meanwhile.  One of the issues is that Service gateway can't
   obtain the WTP information(MAC address, etc) because the WTP
   management function is located in AC device.  The challenge is that
   WTP information for the subscriber is appreciated for operators in
   the charge bill, in order to the collect statistical parameter and
   push advertisement to special WTP, or locate the fault locating
   exactly, etc.

   This document introduces WTP information transported using DHCP.  In
   this procedure, DHCP snooping is deployed on the WTP node or AC node.
   Then the WTP information can be inserted into the DHCP message in
   extension option.  Because the DHCP messages is send out from the
   subscriber, so binding between WTP information and subscriber is set
   up after this procedure.  Then GW obtain the WTP information through
   which the subscriber access network.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms.

   Wireless Termination Point (WTP)

   The physical or logical network entity that contains an RF antenna
   and wireless physical layer (PHY) to transmit and receive station
   traffic for wireless access networks.  This definition has the same
   meaning used in [RFC4118].  It also called AP.

   Access Controller (AC)

   The network entity that provides WTP access to the network
   infrastructure in the data plane, control plane, management plane, or
   a combination therein, as defined in[RFC4118].

   Also the terms used in this document are accordant with the
   terminologies in [RFC2131].


2.  Applicability

   This specification applies when layer 2 network is deployed between
   WTP and GW, where DHCP relay function isn't deployed on the access
   device.  In these cases, the procedure specified here should be used
   for WTP information transmission.  This can occur for two scenarios.
   First, the AC is deployed as a standalone node, which doesn't
   transport the traffic for the subscriber at all, shown in figure 2.
   Other, the AC deployed on the path between WTP and GW, is involved in
   the subscriber traffic transport, shown in figure 3.  In the second

   case, the layer 2 connection is assumed between AC and GW as noted.

   Moreover, the specification applies when DHCP snooping mentioned in
   [I-D.ietf-savi-dhcp] must be deployed on WTP or AC node.  Any DHCP
   protocol agent and server that implements the mechanisms described in
   this document can assume that they follow the DHCP general procedure
   must follow [RFC2131].


3.  DHCP Operation

   The DHCP procedure when DHCP snooping is deployed on WTP/AC node is
   described in this section.  Take the scenario as subscriber traffic
   bypass AC (figure 3) for example.  The operation for the WTP
   information transport is shown in figure 4.

                          Figure 4 DHCP Operation

   1 DHCP snooping is deployed on WTP node.  Then WTP node can capture
   the DHCP message.

   2 STA initiates DHCP procedure via DHCP discovery message.

   3 WTP can insert the WTP information,such as MAC address into the new
   DHCP option of DHCP message, both DHCP Discovery and DHCP Request .

   4 The WTP information for the subscriber can be obtained by GW via
   DHCP option.  The GW treats this information as subscriber profile.

   5 After IP address assignment, the authentication procedure is
   initiated.  During the authentication procedure, WTP info can be
   transported to AAA service via RADIUS message.  Then the subscriber
   bill can be created contain the access WTP information.  This step is
   out the scope of this specification.

   As the other scenario shown in figure 3, the AC is deployed on the
   path between WTP and GW.  Additionally, AC is responsible to
   transport subscriber traffic from AP to GW.  In this case, AC manages
   and configures WTP.  We assume AC has record the WTP MAC address.  So
   here, the DHCP snooping function is deployed on AC node in this
   scenario.  However, the procedure is same as shown in figure 4.


4.  Location Information Option

   This documents defines a new option called Location Information
   Option.  It is an optional option for the specific subscriber's WTP
   information transport.  The format of the Location Information Option
   is:

    |       |       |                                               |

                   Figure 5 Location Information Option

   The code is recommended to the value still unassigned.  In this
   document, value 140 is suggested.

   The length is 6, while the WTP information field is just filled in
   WTP MAC address.
