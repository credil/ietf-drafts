                       Address Selection for DMM
                   draft-liu-dmm-address-selection-00

Abstract


   In DMM scenario, it is possible for the MN to have multiple mobility
   anchor points and corresponding prefixes.  In that case, MN needs to
   know the type of the addresses then it can select the right one for
   application to use.  This document describes a mechnism to extend RA
   message to carry a flag which can be used to identify the nature of
   the prefix.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.  Problem of address selection for DMM

   As draft-liu-dmm-dynamic-anchor-discussion-00 introduced, there is a
   address selection problem for DMM dynamic anchor solution.  The
   difficulty of this problem is: the MN does not know the difference
   between the multiple prefixes.  There is no way for the network to
   tell the MN the nature of the different prefixes and there is no
   standard mechnism for the MN to select the right prefix.


2.  Extension to Router Advertisment

   Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] extend IPv6 router advertisement message for
   movement detection and home agent information broadcasting.  This
   document proposes to further extend the IPv6 router advertisement
   message to carry a flag to identify the nature of the prefix that it
   is advertising.

Internet-Draft     draft-liu-dmm-address-selection-00         March 2012


   This document proposes to extend the prefix information option to add
   a 'T' flag, its definition is as follows:

   T (Type):

   Type flag.  This is a 2 bits flag indentifies the types of the
   advertising prefix.  The value of this flag could be:

   00: Local home network prefix.  It means that this prefix is
   allocated and advertised by current router which the MN attaches to.

   01 : Remote home network prefix.  It means that this prefix is
   allocated by another router instead of the router that the MN
   currently attaches to.

   10: Reserved.

   11: Reserved.

   The mechanism that used for the router to identify the types of the
   prefix is out the scope of this document.  As an example, the router
   can query the policy server to know which router allocates a
   particular prefix.


3.  Mobile Node Operation

   The mobile node knows the types of the prefixes from the T flag of
   the router advertisment message.  The applications on the mobile node
   can use this information to select the right IP address.  For
   example, for on-going session, application always choose to use the
   prefix that it used before it handovers to a new location.  For the
   newly initiate application, it will use the prefix that allocated by
   current router, e.g. local home network prefix.  The mobile node can
   use advanced socket API to select the proper prefix, for example,
   extension to RFC 5014.The detail mechnism is out the scope of this
   document.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.
