Abstract 

   The definition of a transport profile for MPLS means that MPLS 
   network architectures will emerge that combines both managed and 
   control plane driven MPLS sub-networks and requires interconnection 
   of same to achieve a unified MPLS architecture. 
    
   This document generalizes the problem of sub-network interconnect, 
   discusses issues in general and suggests ways forward.

1. Introduction 

   Networks that provide an end-to-end service infrastructure are 
   typically deployed as multiple domains or sub-networks in order to 
   scale. These different domains may be operated by different 
   technologies using different control plane technology (e.g. 
   management driven control plane (centralized) or distributed control 
   plane). 

   Within the MPLS control plane there exist a number of functional 
   behaviors that are typically associated with a single control 
   protocol and function autonomously from the other control protocols. 
   That is to say when a labeled layer and associated control protocol 
   is overlaid on another, there is frequently no operational coupling 
   between them. When two control protocols are operated side by side 
   the same is true (e.g. ships in the night). An example of the former 
   would be pseudo wires over a PSN. An example of the latter would be 
   L2 and L3 virtual private networks (VPNs) sharing a common packet 
   switched network (PSN). 

   The introduction of transport functions to MPLS and the intent to 
   deploy, merge or otherwise combine networks that will concatenate 
   sub-networks that have different operational characteristics and/or 
   control planes (including management) introduces the requirement to 
   integrate operations across multiple sub-networks. This frequently is 
   manifested in requirements on nodes at sub-network boundaries and/or 
   alignment of identifiers in order to construct a unified end-to-end 
   MPLS based service plane. 

   By having a unified MPLS based service plane, a network operator is 
   able to provide services across different MPLS domains instrumented 
   with common management and control functionality in order to provide 
   scalable service offerings on a common MPLS technology base.  

   This document is a framework that postulates models and functional 
   requirements for sub-network interconnect to achieve a unified end to 
   end MPLS based service plane or "Unified MPLS".

2. Conventions used in this document 

2.1. Terminology 

   Binding: Is the mechanism for association and interconnection of 
   label switched path (LSP) or pseudo wire (PW) segments that exist in 
   different sub-networks. 

   Section: As per RFC 5960[17]. 

   Segment: A part of a PW or LSP that has one or more contiguous 
   sections in a common sub-network. This usage is as per RFC 6372[18]. 

   Sub-network: A portion of a larger MPLS network that is operated by a 
   single system and whose boundaries are set by the scope of the 
   system. The system may be a control plane or management system. 
   Similarly it could be a sub-layer stacked on another sub-network. 

2.2. Acronyms 

   LIB - label information base 

   LSP - label switched path 

   MEG - Maintenance Entity Group 

   MEP - Maintenance Entity Group End Point 

   MIP - Maintenance Entity Group Intermediate Point 

   PSN - packet switched network 

   PW - pseudo wire 

   SPME - Sub-path Maintenance Entity 

3. Sub-Network Interconnect Scenarios 

   The combination of MPLS label swapping and label stacking makes it 
   possible to consider a number of atomic interconnect scenarios, 
   briefly summarized here: 

   Peer Model - is the scenario when an LSP or PW has segments in 
   different sub-networks. 

   Segmentation Model - is the scenario when a client LSP or PW with 
   common establishment and maintenance procedures has sections in 
   separate sub-networks. This model can recurse arbitrarily. 
 
Allan et al.,            Expires April, 2012                   [Page 4] 
 
Internet-Draft  draft-allan-unified-mpls-ic-req-frmwk-00    October 2011 
 

   Overlay Model - is the simplest case of the segmentation model in 
   which a section of an LSP or PW is a distinct sub-network. 

   Termination Model - is the scenario where a non-MPLS or PW transfer 
   function separates the sub-networks. The termination model logically 
   isolates the sub-networks and is included simply for completeness. 

4. Sub-Network Interconnect Mechanisms 

   There are two interconnect mechanisms considered. The first (Border 
   node) postulates a node that spans two sub-networks and both likely 
   operated by a single provider. The second (Border link) postulates a 
   link connecting sub-networks of two distinct organizations within a 
   provider or two distinct providers. 

4.1. Border Node 

   A border node is one that implements, interconnects and interworks 
   LSPs or PWs with segments or sections in different sub-networks. The 
   interworking function at the border node will either terminate, swap 
   or encapsulate labels. 

4.2. Border Link 

   A border link is the case whereby two border nodes are connected back 
   to back in a sub-network that consists of a single link.  

5. Sub-network types 

   In the current MPLS architecture the following sub-network types 
   exist: 

5.1. Infrastructure sub-network types 

   MPLS-TD: Topology driven MPLS. LSP setup is via the LDP protocol [6] 
   with path routing determined by the IGP. ECMP, merging and PHP are 
   are included in the set of possible dataplane behaviors. P2mp LSPs 
   are supported by mLDP [7]. 

   MPLS-TE: LSP setup is via the RSVP-TE protocol[8] with path routing 
   determined by a TE enabled IGP (e.g. OSPF-TE) according to bandwidth 
   and QoS constraints. PHP is included in the set of dataplane 
   behaviors. Bandwidth allocation, class of service or priotity(PHB) 
   are typically part of traffic handling. 

   Managed MPLS-TP: LSP setup is via management action. LSPs are purely 
   connection oriented p2p or p2mp.

Internet-Draft  draft-allan-unified-mpls-ic-req-frmwk-00    October 2011 
 

   Signalled MPLS-TP: LSP setup is via RSVP-TE GMPLS[9]. LSPs are purely 
   connection oriented p2p or p2mp. 

5.2. Service Sub-network types 

   L3VPN: VPN setup is via the BGP protocol as per RFC 4364[10]. Note 
   that this can be an IP-VPN (via IGP peering with the VRF) or an MPLS-
   VPN (via a combination of IGP and MPLS CP peering with the VRF). 

   L2VPN: VPN setup is via the PW Control Protocol per RFC 4447 (LDP in 
   targeted mode) or BGP protocols. A broadcast domain is emulated which 
   will have the effect of limiting sub-network interconnect to a single 
   point to avoid loops. 

   VPWS: VPWS setup is via the PW Control Protocol per rfc 4447 (LDP in 
   targeted mode). 

6. Issues & Requirements 

   In theory, any ingress label can be mapped to one or more egress 
   labels or label stack permutations via the ILM to NHLFE mapping 
   defined in RFC 3031[2]. Further one carrier"s infrastructure layer 
   may be a client of another carrier"s infrastructure. More 
   considerations need to come into play in order to produce a tractable 
   set of sub-network interworking scenarios. The following is a partial 
   list of some of the issues to be considered and/or addressed: 

6.1. Alignment of OAM functionality  

   Not all OAM encapsulations guarantee fate sharing with the LSP of 
   interest across all of the sub-network types in MPLS. This not only 
   means that failures may not be detected or detected in a timely 
   manner, it also means that "false positives" are a possibility as 
   failures may occur on the path taken by the OAM PDUs. 

   Any OAM encapsulation using a reserved label, e.g. the GAL[12], or 
   Router Alert as used by VCCV type 2[13], or without a PW control word 
   will not have predictable control over fate sharing with normal 
   payload for any LSP or PW that has a section that transits a MPLS-TD 
   subnetwork that implements ECMP[11]. 

   A separate issue is interconnecting subnetworks where the LSPs have a 
   different cardinality of end points (e.g. concatenating mp2p to p2p), 
   implying a different number of maintenance entities than would be 
   suggested by an implementation dimensioned to a single subnetwork"s 
   characteristics.

Internet-Draft  draft-allan-unified-mpls-ic-req-frmwk-00    October 2011 
 

6.2. OAM identifier mismatches 

   MEG, MEP, MIP and nodal addressing will not pose identifier mismatch 
   problems. Where such problems will arise is in the use of RFC 4379 
   LSP Ping [3]. This is because LSP-PING uses identifiers associated 
   with a specific sub-network type in the FEC stack as part of the 
   processing to detect inconsistencies between the control plane and 
   the data plane. 

   [Issue: The on demand cv draft provides for the Static LSP and Static 
   PW TLVs for the FEC stack which allows intermediate nodes to validate 
   the FEC stack against the MEG ID for the local MIP. The applicability 
   for this should be generalized such that it can be used end to end 
   across domains. This will also raise the problem of disseminating MEG 
   information to non-transport subnetworks as not all defined MPLS sub-
   network types use the current fields in the IP based LSP MEG ID] 

6.3. OAM encapsulation 

   The MPLS architecture permits multiple OAM encapsulations that may or 
   may nor have an IP header. Any interconnect mechanism needs to be 
   able to align not only capability but encapsulations end to end. 

6.4. Protection Mechanisms 

   An MPLS LSP or PW sub-network may be made resilient by any number of 
   mechanisms. There is also three scenarios of note, end to end 
   protection, end to end restoration and sub-network protection. 

   End to end protection offers minimal complications in sub-network 
   interconnect as the interworking functions is common to that of the 
   unprotected case, that is to say transit nodes do not participate in 
   protection switching. 

   Sub-network protection is universally offered by the use of 
   mechanisms that operate within the level such as detours [19] and may 
   require label merging at the border node. Mechanisms that operate at 
   nested MPLS label levels (e.g. SPMEs or FRR facility protection) have 
   no impact on sub-network interconnect. 

   End to end restoration is a bit more complicated as it involves 
   coordinating dynamic action between sub-networks.  

   It also becomes possible to consider sub-network restoration with 
   many of the same considerations as path maintenance and re-sizing.

Internet-Draft  draft-allan-unified-mpls-ic-req-frmwk-00    October 2011 
 

6.5. Label space management 

   The MPLS architecture has always been based around local 
   administration of a node"s label space. As such mechanisms to 
   partition the label space between multiple administrative entities is 
   not currently supported and would be difficult to retrofit. 

   A consequence of this is that a border node is potentially required 
   to provide labels from a common pool to both a control and management 
   plane, e.g. a management system be required to obtain label values 
   from the node prior to populating the LIB vs. being delegated a pool. 
   This suggests that such a mechanism be carried forward for all 
   managed nodes such that only a single mechanism need be implemented. 
   However this is an implementation decision. 

6.6. Path maintenance and re-sizing 

   It must be possible to make operational modifications to a path 
   segment in a hitless fashion. The normal procedure for MPLS-TE is 
   known as "make before break". This gives rise to two scenarios, the 
   first is end to end "make before break", and the other is make before 
   break confined to a sub-network with the border node as a pinned 
   waypoint. This means the design of the inter-sub-network binding 
   information permit make before break modification of one segment of 
   the LSP. 

6.7. Sub-network migration 

   The practical considerations are documented in RFC 5950[4] and by 
   reference RFC 5493[5]. 

6.8. (Non)Interworking of DP and CP notifications 

   Within the MPLS architecture there are techniques for propagating the 
   status of adjacent sections of either a native service or PW section 
   in both the data plane and the control plane. One example 
   (documenting both) is RFC 6310[14]. 

   When concatenating subnetworks the interworking of dataplane fault 
   notifications [15] or protection switching coordination [16] and 
   control plane indications will not be possible. The reason is that 
   data plane indications flow end to end on a labeled path therefore 
   will not be visible to border nodes, a requirement to enable 
   interworking of dataplane notifications with the control plane in any 
   useful form. 

   When connecting a subnetwork restricted to data plane only 
   notifications to a subnetwork that will support either dataplane or 
 
Allan et al.,            Expires April, 2012                   [Page 8] 
 
Internet-Draft  draft-allan-unified-mpls-ic-req-frmwk-00    October 2011 
 

   control plane notifications, the border node will be required to 
   negotiate exclusive use of dataplane notifications in any control 
   plane signaling during the path setup. This will have implications in 
   both the interconnect data model, and potential enhancements to 
   signaling. 

7. Operational Decoupling 

   The objective of any sub-network interconnect solution is to decouple 
   the operation of the interconnected systems in order to minimize any 
   dependencies. 

   The sub-network interconnect must accommodate interconnecting LSPs 
   and PWs with different establishment and persistency characteristics. 
   This is determined by whether the LSP, PW or segment is provisioned 
   or signaled, where from a persistency point of view, a provisioned 
   entry is permanent and exists until removed by management action, 
   while a signaled entity fate shares with a control plane adjacency 
   and may come and go during the life time of the inter sub-network 
   binding. 

   The state present at a border node to bind the LSP or PW spanning the 
   subnetworks together should exist independently of the 
   characteristics of the LSPs or associated control or management 
   planes.  

   This also requires a level of indirection such that the management 
   action is decoupled from the mechanics of label assignment in each 
   sub-network and may work with sub-network resiliency mechanisms. 

   So the state "connect whatever label from sub-network A associated 
   with FOO to whatever label from sub-network B is associated with BAR" 
   should be persistent.
