              Deployment Considerations for Public 4over6
              draft-wu-softwire-public4over6-deployment-00

Abstract

   Public 4over6 is a stateful transition mechanism which assigns public
   IPv4 address to CPE/host and uses IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel.  It doesn't
   involve CGN as in DS-lite and reduces the mapping scale on the
   Concentrator to per-subscriber level.  This document describers
   deployment models for Public 4over6, and the deployment
   considerations of the Public 4over6 architecture.

1.  Introduction

   Public 4over6 [I-D.ietf-softwire-public-4over6] is a transition
   mechanism that enables operators to assign public IPv4 addresses to
   end users over IPv6.  Public 4over6 uses IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire to
   provide IPv4 connectivity between users in IPv6 access networks and
   IPv4 Internet.This document discuss various Public 4over6 deployment
   considerations for operators.

   Terminology of this document follows the definitions and
   abbreviations of [I-D.ietf-softwire-public-4over6] .

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Concentrator Deployment Considerations

   Public 4over6 and DS-Lite [RFC6333] shares some deployment
   considerations, while Concentrator and Initiator of Public 4over6
   play a similar role to AFTR and B4 of DS-Lite.

3.1.  Interface Consideration

   Tunnel Concentrator is deployed at the IPv4-IPv6 network border where
   the tunnel interface is IPv6 and the external interface is IPv4.  It
   shares the same deployment considerations with
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-deployment].

3.2.  MTU Consideration

   Same with [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-deployment].

3.3.  Fragmentation

   Same with [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-deployment].

3.4.  Logging at Concentrator

   Timestamped logging is essential for back tracking specific users
   when a problem is identified with one of the assigned public IPv4
   address.  Operators only log one entry per subscriber.  The log
   should include the subscriber's IPv6 address and the public IPv4
   address.

3.5.  Reliability Considerations of Concentrator

   For redundancy, the backup Concentrator should apply either of the
   following types.  One is that a dedicated DHCP server synchronizes
   mapping entries with all Concentrators considering that the DHCP
   server is responsible for IPv4 address allocation.  Each Concentrator
   maintain per-subscriber mapping table accordingly.  Once the working
   Concentrator is down, subscribers will switch to the backup
   Concentrator using technologies like anycast etc.

   The other method is that Initiators PING the Concentrator
   periodically to check the status of the Concentrator.  If the PING
   test fails for a specific number of times, Initiators should release
   the current public IPv4 address and require for another public IPv4
   address from the backup Concentrator.

3.6.  Placement of Concentrator

   Concentrator maintains a per-subscriber mapping table, smaller than
   the per-session binding table on DS-Lite AFTR.  As a result,
   Concentrator can be deployed closer to core of the network to cover a
   larger region.  And the amount of subscribers and the capability of
   devices should be taken into account.

3.7.  Considerations for Geographically Aware Services

   Even though Public 4over6 supports the assignment of public IPv4
   address, identification by IP address is no easier than that in DS-
   Lite.  Thus applications that assume such geographic information may
   not work as intended.  In Public 4over6, each address represents a
   single machine, a single household, or a single small office, but
   it's hard to identify geographic information over IPv6 access
   networks.  The considerations are similar to section 2.11 of
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-deployment]

4.  Initiator Deployment Considerations

4.1.  Concentrator Discovery Considerations

   A public 4over6 Initiator must discover the Concentrator's IPv6
   address before starting IPv4 connections.  The IPv6 address can be
   learned through out-of-band mechanism, manual configuration or DHCPv6
   option.  If an operator uses DHCPv6 for provision the Initiator,
   DHCPv6 option defined in [RFC6334] must be implemented in the
   Initiator.

4.2.  DNS Deployment Considerations

   The Initiator can implement a proxy resolver that will proxy DNS
   query from IPv4 transport to the DNS server in the IPv6 network.

   Alternatively, the Initiator can tunnel IPv4 DNS query to an external
   DNS server over IPv6 network.

4.3.  Optional NAT44 Functionality on Initiator

   The Initiator can be a host or a CPE device.  If it's a host, the
   host can get Public IPv4 address and does not need NAT44 function.
   If it's a CPE, NAT44 function must be enabled for local private IPv4
   Network.

5.  Deployment Experience

   Tsinghua University has deployed a Tunnel Concentrator in CERNET lab.
   The DHCP server collocates on the same device with Tunnel
   Concentrator.  Public4over6 client software has also been released,
   with Win7 version and Linux version.  The system has provided IPv4
   service over IPv6 access networks of universities from China.

   The IPv4-over-IPv6 services Public 4over6 provided is transparent to
   the upper layer applications.  Even though in IPv6 networks, users
   can also get access to IPv4 websites with no difference to native
   IPv4.  Because of assignment of public IPv4 address to Initiators,
   users can experience P2P services.  Public 4over6 is able to provide
   qualified IPv4 services with no side impact on native IPv6.

6.  IDC Transition Usage

   IDC is responsible for steady service for users.  And as a server, a
   public IPv4 address does good to guarantee the IDC's QoS.  Public
   4over6 is able to provide service for IDC locating in an IPv6-only
   network.  As an Initiator, an IDC will get a public IPv4 address and
   achieve "dual-stack" environment, which is essential for better
   service.

7.  Security Consideration

   This specification raises no new security issues.
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-public-4over6] discusses public 4over6 related
   security issues.
