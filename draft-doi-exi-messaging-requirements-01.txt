                draft-doi-exi-messaging-requirements-01

Abstract

   EXI (Efficient XML Interchange) is a specification on efficient
   encoding of XML.  EXI is useful if an application requires XML based
   message exchange but no sufficient resource is available.  However,
   schema-informed mode of EXI needs some out-of-band coordination
   between communicating nodes.  This document discusses requirement on
   use of schema-informed EXI as a message exchange format on the
   Internet systems.

1.  Introduction

   EXI[W3C.REC-exi-20110310] (Efficient XML Interchange) is a
   specification on efficient encoding of XML.  EXI is useful if an
   application requires XML based message exchange but no sufficient
   resource is available, such as environments discussed in
   [I-D.shelby-core-coap-req].  However, EXI may need some out-of-band
   coordination between communicating nodes.

   The target of this document is not to discuss EXI spec itself.  This
   document discusses how to use it as a message exchange format (a
   presentation layer) on the Internet systems to support development
   and deployment of EXI systems in the Internet including constrained
   nodes.


2.  Schema Update and Data Type Derivation

   In communication use cases of XML/EXI, XML schema (or equivalents) is
   often used to define a standard message format.  A schema defines a
   message format, and such message format is expected to be able to
   extend.  There are at least two ways of extension.

   First way is to update the schema.  Brand-new devices with a new
   functionality may have updated schema to support extended message.
   In this scenario, a system consists of multiple versions of schema.
   As schema-informed EXI requires communicating nodes to use identical
   schema, this scenario requires schema negotiation.

   Second way is to use derived data types from the schema.  Built-in
   grammar or non-strict schema-informed grammar allow derived XML
   instances from the definition in the XML schema.  To accommodate
   resource-constrained nodes, an application spec may specify a
   parameter set with EXI Profile[W3C.WD-exi-profile-20120731].

   Schema update and data derivation are not exclusive.  Application
   designers may choose one or both approaches.  This is tradeoff
   between extensiblity and interoperability.


3.  Schema Negotiation for Strict Schema-Informed EXI Messaging

   In short, EXI has two grammar modes: Schema-informed and Built-in.
   Built-in grammar uses dynamic state machines that learn document
   structure on-the fly.  On the other hand, Schema-informed grammar
   makes a set of state machines from a schema and the state machines
   are used to encode/decode document structure.  Strict mode of schema-
   informed grammar uses static state machines for XML elements and

   attributes defined in the XML schema.  Wildcard elements are handled
   in the built-in grammar (dynamic state machines).  Non-strict mode
   allows XML data to be derived from that defined in the XML schema.

   Because schema-informed grammars can make smallest messages in most
   cases, some applications may want to make use of schema-informed
   grammar as its message format.

   To decode an EXI message, the sender and receiver must have exactly
   same schema.  However, the way to negotiate and match schema between
   communicating nodes is not yet well defined.

   To use EXI as application message encodings, clients and servers
   should have a way to coordinate the schema used in the communication.
   This is similar to content negotiation defined in HTTP[RFC2616].
   This section describes schema negotiation cases based on common
   communication pattern.

3.1.  Content-Type and Schema Identification

   To negotiate schema, an application must have a way to identify a
   schema.

   A content-type may use schema-informed EXI as its encoding.  Each
   content-type should define how to identify a schema used in a
   communication.  The identifier (schemaId) may have internal structure
   to indicate backward compatibility.

   A good practice is to have schema version number (Major.Minor) as a
   schema ID.  Between minor modifications, schemas should have backward
   compatibility (a node with schema 4.3 shall have schema 4.0, 4.1 and
   4.2).  Between major modifications, schema should not have it (a node
   with schema 4.3 may not have schema 1.x, 2.x and 3.x).  Note that
   schemaId is local identifier space that belongs to a content-type.
   There is no need to have global schema ID registry.

   On schema negotiation, a receiver of a message declares a set of
   acceptable schema IDs and a sender selects a schema ID among the
   given set.  The selected schema ID should be in schemaId field of EXI
   option header.

3.2.  Client-Driven Schema Negotiation

   Client-driven schema negotiation is the way that a client decides
   actual schema version used in a communication.  This happens in POST
   or PUT style communications.  In [RFC2616], try-and-redirect style of
   client-driven content negotiation is described.  Similar way should
   be possible in schema negotiation.  However, it may be simpler to

   have a way to declare a server's acceptable schema set.

   As an alternative, a server (or a resource on a server) may declare
   its available schema set via some service discovery mechanisms.
   Candidates are such as DNS-SD[I-D.cheshire-dnsext-dns-sd] TXT
   resource records or media type in link
   format[I-D.nottingham-http-link-header] that represents a resource.
   If an application can assume a client does service discovery before
   using the service, it may assume the client knows server's schema
   set.

3.3.  Server-Driven Schema Negotiation

   Server-driven schema negotiation is the way that a server decides
   actual schema version used in a communication.  In HTTP, schema
   negotiation in GET requests should do server-driven negotiation.  In
   [RFC2616], Accept: header is defined to make server-driven content
   negotiation.  Schema negotiation can be piggybacked on it by using
   some content type parameter to carry acceptable schema ID set.

3.4.  Publisher-Driven Schema Negotiation

   CoAP[I-D.ietf-core-coap] and some other protocols may have publish-
   subscribe (observer) pattern in communication.  In this case, a
   subscriber should give its acceptable schema ID set to a publisher as
   it registers its subscription request.


4.  Security Considerations

   No particular security concern is raised by this document.
   Applications should be able to detect malformed input as usual.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
