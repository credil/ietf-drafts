                       VxLAN Router Alert Option
                 draft-singh-nvo3-vxlan-router-alert-00

Abstract

   This proposal describes a new option to achieve a mechanism which
   alerts VxLAN terminating VTEP to more closely examine the contents of
   the packet encapsulated under VxLAN header.  This option is useful
   for case(s) where a given frame encapsulated within a given VXLAN
   segment responsible for carrying data between two different End
   Systems contains some control information (e.g OAM information) that
   may require special handling/processing by terminating VTEP.

Internet-Draft          VxLAN Router Alert Option               May 2013


1.  Introduction

   VXLAN [I-D.draft-mahalingam-dutt-dcops-vxlan]is a tunneling mechanism
   to overlay Layer 2 networks on top of Layer 3 networks.  In most
   cases the end point of the tunnel (VTEP) is intended to be at the
   edge of the network, typically connecting an access switch to an IP
   transport network.  The access switch could be a physical or a
   virtual switch located within the hypervisor on the server which is
   connected to End System which is a VM.

   VXLAN segment encapsulates End System data at Originating VTEP and
   carries it over L3 network to the Terminating VTEP, where VXLAN
   header is interpreted, removed and data is passed on to the End
   System.

   There could be some scenarios like for case of OAM, where the network
   element at originating VTEP needs to encapsulate some control
   information for a given VXLAN segment, and this control information
   needs to be analyzed and processed at the terminating VTEP for that
   VXLAN segment.

   This document defines a mechanism whereby Originating VTEP can add
   additional information to the VXLAN header, based upon which the
   Terminating VTEP can decide to analyze the payload under VXLAN
   packet, rather then forwarding it to the destination End System.

   VTEP: VXLAN Tunnel End Point.

   VM: Virtual Machine.

   End System: Could be VM etc. - System whose data is expected to go
   over VXLAN Segment.

   OAM: Operations, Administration, and Maintenance

   Other terminologies are as defined in
   [I-D.draft-mahalingam-dutt-dcops-vxlan].

3.  Approach

   If the Originating VTEP decides to generate control informtaion,
   which needs to go over a given VXLAN segment and if the Terminating
   VTEP needs to analyze and process it, then following procedures have
   to be followed at Originating and Terminating VTEP(s):-

3.1.  Originating VTEP Procedure

   When creating the VXLAN header for a given VXLAN segment, the
   Originating VTEP MUST set Router Alert Bit in the Flag bits in VXLAN
   header.  The VNI for this frame MUST be the same as for the given
   VXLAN segment which carries the data traffic of the End System.


       VXLAN Header:
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |R|R|R|R|I|R|R|RA|           Reserved                           |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI) |   Reserved    |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

       RA: Router Alter Bit (Proposed)

3.2.  Terminating VTEP Procedure

   On receiving VXLAN frame, the Terminating VTEP would do the usual
   VXLAN processing as defined in
   [I-D.draft-mahalingam-dutt-dcops-vxlan], but if the RA Bit in Flags
   is Set it MUST send the rest of the inner frame for further
   processing to the above application.  The details of the applications
   and how it would process the inner frame is outside the scope of this
   document.  This frame MUST not be sent to the target End System.
