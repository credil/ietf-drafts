                     BGP as an MVPN PE-CE Protocol
                     draft-ietf-l3vpn-mvpn-pe-ce-00

Abstract

   When a Service Provider offers BGP/MPLS IP VPN service to its
   customers, RFCs 6513 and 6514 describe protocols and procedures that
   the Service Provider can use in order to carry the customer's IP
   multicast traffic from one customer site to others.  BGP can be used
   to carry customer multicast routing information from one Provider
   Edge (PE) router to another, but it is assumed that PIM is running on
   the interface between a Customer Edge (CE) router and a PE router.
   This document specifies protocols and procedures that, under certain
   conditions, allow customer multicast routing information to carried
   between PE and CE via BGP.  This can eliminate the need to run PIM on
   the PE-CE interfaces, potentially eliminating the need to run PIM on
   the PE routers at all.

1.  Introduction

   When a Service Provider offers BGP/MPLS IP VPN service to its
   customers, [RFC6513] and [RFC6514] describe protocols and procedures
   that the Service Provider can use in order to carry the customer's IP
   multicast traffic from one customer site to others.  BGP can be used
   to carry customer multicast routing information from one Provider

   Edge (PE) router to another, but it is assumed that PIM is running on
   the interface between a Customer Edge (CE) router and a PE router.
   This document specifies protocols and procedures that under certain
   conditions, allow customer multicast routing information to carried
   between PE and CE via BGP.  This can eliminate the need to run PIM on
   the PE-CE interfaces, potentially eliminating the need to run PIM on
   the PE routers at all.  It is however assumed that PIM is the
   multicast routing protocol running at the customer sites.

   This document defines a new SAFI known as Customer-Multicast
   (C-MCAST) SAFI.  This SAFI is used to carry customer multicast
   routing information from CE to PE (and vice versa).  The use of this
   SAFI is only defined when the AFI is either IPv4 or IPv6.  The
   procedures of this document are applicable only if BGP is being used
   as the PE-PE control protocol for carrying customer multicast
   routing.  It is presupposed that if these procedures are being used
   on any interface of a given VRF, then PIM is NOT enabled on that
   interface or on any other VRF interface of that same VRF.  It is also
   assumed that if a CE is using BGP C-MCAST on its interface to one PE,
   then it is using BGP C-MCAST on its interfaces to all the PEs to
   which it is connected, and that PIM is not enabled on any of these
   interfaces.

   Throughout this document, we will use the terms "MCAST-VPN route" and
   "C-MCAST route" to mean routes that have the corresponding SAFI.

   This document assumes that a CE and a PE exchange C-MCAST routes over
   a direct BGP session (i.e., the C-MCAST routes do not pass through a
   route reflector or other third party on their way from CE to PE, or
   vice versa).

   The NLRI format of a C-MCAST route is modeled on the NLRI format of
   the MCAST-VPN SAFI, as defined in [RFC6514].  However, since the
   C-MCAST routes are always exchanged in the context of a particular
   VPN, Route Distinguishers (RDs) are not used.  Also, C-MCAST routes
   are never distributed from one PE to another.

   Where the procedures of this document require a PE or a CE to
   determine the upstream neighbor for a particular multicast (*,G) or
   (S,G) state, the upstream neighbor is determined using the procedures
   of [RFC4601], rather than the procedures of [RFC6513] or [RFC6514].
   That is, the upstream neighbor selected for a particular (*,G) or
   (S,G) is the same as it would be if PIM were being used between the
   PE and CE.  This includes support for non-congruent multicast
   topologies.  The upstream neighbor address determined through these
   procedures MUST be the same address that the upstream neighbor puts
   in the next hop field of BGP Updates that it sends to the
   "downstream" PE or CE.  Note that neither the VRF Route Import

   Extended Community nor the Source AS Extended Community, defined in
   [RFC6514], are used.

   When following the procedures of this document, customer IP multicast
   traffic is sent natively from CE to PE, and vice versa.  There is no
   encapsulation or tunneling of the multicast traffic.  Therefore there
   is no need for C-MCAST routes corresponding to the I-PMSI A-D routes
   or S-PMSI A-D routes or [RFC6514].  Similarly, there is no need for
   the PMSI Tunnel attribute of [RFC6514].

   This document does not provide a mechanism corresponding to the "PIM
   Assert" mechanism of [RFC4601].  It is assumed either that the PE-CE
   interfaces are point-to-point interfaces, or else that the multicast
   procedures in the PE and CE can determine, by examination of the
   layer 2 headers, the node from which a given multicast data packet
   was received.

   Support for "Dense Mode Multicast" (PIM-DM) is outside the scope of
   this document.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  C-MCAST SAFI NLRI Format

   The BGP Multiprotocol Extensions [RFC4760] allow BGP to carry routes
   from multiple different "AFI/SAFIs".  This document defines a new a
   new SAFI known as a C-MCAST SAFI with a value to be assigned by the
   IANA.  This SAFI is used along with the AFI of IPv4 (1) or IPv6 (2).

   The C-MCAST NLRI defined below is carried in the BGP UPDATE messages
   [RFC4271] using the BGP multiprotocol extensions [RFC4760] with a AFI
   of IPv4 (1) or IPv6 (2) assigned by IANA and a C-MCAST SAFI with a
   value to be assigned by the IANA.

   The Next hop field of MP_REACH_NLRI attribute SHALL be interpreted as
   an IPv4 adress whenever the length of the Next Hop address is 4
   octets, and as an IPv6 address whenever the length of the Next Hop is
   address is 16 octets.

   The NLRI field in the MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI is a prefix
   with a maximum length of 12 octers for IPv4 AFI and 36 octets for
   IPv6 AFI.  The following is the format of the C-MCAST NLRI:

                      |    Route Type (1 octet)           |
                      +-----------------------------------+
                      |     Length (1 octet)              |
                      +-----------------------------------+
                      | Route Type specific (variable)    |
                      +-----------------------------------+


   The Route Type field defines encoding of the rest of the C-MCAST
   NLRI.  (Route Type specific C-MCAST NLRI).

   The Length field indicates the length in octets of the Route Type
   specific field of C-MCAST NLRI.

   This document defines the following Route Types:

                           1 - Shared Tree Join Route
                           2 - Source Tree Join Route
                           4 - Source Prune A-D Route


   The encodings and procedures for these route types are described in
   the subsequent sections.  The NLRI encodings are modeled after those
   of [RFC6514], in order to facilitate implementation in generation of
   MCAST-VPN routes.

   In order for two BGP speakers to exchange C-MCAST NLRI, they must use
   BGP Capabilities Advertisement [RFC5492] to ensure that they both are
   capable of properly processing the C-MCAST NLRI.  This is done as
   specified in [RFC4760], by using a capability code 1 (multiprotocol
   BGP) with an AFI of IPv4 (1) or IPv6 (2) and a SAFI of C-MCAST with a
   value to be assigned by IANA.

2.1.  C-MCAST Join and Prune Routes

   The "route type specific" part of the C-MCAST NLRI is the same for
   the Shared Tree Join, Source Tree Join, and Source Prune A-D Route
   Types.

                      +-----------------------------------+


   The value of the AFI field in the MP_REACH_NLRI/MP_UNREACH_NLRI that
   carries the C-MCAST NLRI determines whether the multicast source and
   multicast group addresses fields are IPv4 addresses (AFI 1) or IPv6
   addresses (AFI 2).  The length field of IPv4 source and group
   addresses is 32 bits and the length field of IPv6 addresses is 128
   bits.

   Use of other values of the Multicast Source Length and Multicast
   Group Length fields is outside the scope of this document.  If other
   values occur, or if the NLRI length is not as expected, given the AFI
   value, the NLRI should be considered to be malformed.  An
   implementation SHOULD treat such an UPDATE as though the NLRI has
   been withdrawn, SHOULD log an error.

   In a Source Tree Join route, the Multicast Source field and the
   Multicast Group field identify an (S,G) multicast flow, where the IP
   address of S appears in the Multicast Source field and the IP address
   of G appears in the Multicast Group field.

   In a Shared Tree Join route, the Multicast Source field contains the
   Rendezvous Point (RP) address that is associated, at the originator
   of the UPDATE, with the multicast group whose address appears in the
   Multicast Group field.

   In the Source Prune route, the Multicast Source field contains the
   address of a source that is to be pruned from the shared tree
   associated with the multicast group whose address appears in the
   Multicast Group field.

   Usage of C-MCAST Join routes is described in Section 3.  Usage of
   C-MCAST Source Prune routes is described in Section 4.

3.  Exchanging C-MCAST Join Routes

   Multiast Routing Information is exchanged between a CE router and a
   PE a router using C-MCAST NLRIs.  If the procedures of this draft are
   followed, the CE router and the PE router MUST NOT exchange PIM
   messages with each other.  The C-MCAST routes are originated and
   propagated as follows.

3.1.  Originating C-MCAST Join Route at the CE router

   Whenever a) PIM instance on a particular CE router creates a new
   (S,G) or (*,G) state and b) the selected upstream neighbor address
   for that state is a PE router to which the CE router is directly
   connected and with which the CE has a BGP session on whch the C-MCAST
   SAFI is enabled, then the CE router MUST originate a C-MCAST Source
   Tree Join route or a C-MCAST Shared Tree Join route.  The CE router
   uses the procedures of [RFC4601] to determine the upstream neighbor
   (also called the "RPF neighbor").  Note that, unlike [RFC6513], the
   upstream nexthop selection procedures defined in this document are
   not based on the VRF Route Import Extended community [RFC6513].

   The Route Type field of the NLRI is set to "Source Tree Join" if the
   corresponding state is (S,G), and to "Shared Tree Join" if the
   corresponding state is (*,G).

   The Multicast Source field of the NLRI of a C-MCAST Source Tree Join
   route MUST be set to the source address of the corresponding (S,G).
   The Multicast Source field of the NLRI of a C-MCAST Shared Tree Join
   route MUST be set to the address of the RP that is mapped to the
   corresponding (*,G) state.

   The Multicast Group field of the NLRI of either kind of C-MCAST Join
   route MUST be set to the multicast group address of the (S,G) or
   (*,G) state.

   The CE router MUST put its own IP address in the Next Hop field of
   either type of C-MCAST Join route.

   The CE router MUST attach a particular RT to the C-MCAST Join route.
   This RT MUST be either an IP Address Specific RT or an IPv6 Address
   Specific RT, depending upon whether the address of the upstream
   neighbor is an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address.  In either case, the
   address of the upstream neighbor is placed in the Global
   Administrator field of the RT, and the Local Administrator field is
   set to 0.  (Compare to the "C-multicast Import RT" described in
   section 7 of [RFC6514].)  The "address of the upstream neighbor" MUST
   be the address that the upstream neighbor puts in the Next Hop field
   of BGP UPDATEs that it sends to the CE router.

Internet-Draft        BGP as an MVPN PE-CE Protocol         October 2013


   The CE MUST send the C-MCAST Join route on the BGP session to the PE
   that it has selected as the upstream neighbor for the (*,G) or (S,G)
   identified in the NLRI of the route.  Although not required for
   correctness, it is RECOMMENDED that the C-MCAST Join not be sent on
   other BGP sessions.  How this distribution constraint is met is a
   local matter.  Policy based filtering based on the RT is one possible
   way to meet the constraint.  Use of [RFC4684] is another.

   The C-MCAST Shared Tree Join is used to join the shared tree of an
   "Any Source Multicast" (ASM) group.  The C-MCAST Source Tree Join is
   used in both ASM mode and in "Single Source Multicast" (SSM) mode to
   join a source tree.  The C-MCAST Shared Tree Join can be used to join
   a BIDIR-PIM [RFC5015] multicast group, as long as the interface
   between the PE and the CE is a point-to-point interface.

   If a PIM instance on a particular CE router deletes its (S,G) or a
   (*,G) entry, and if there is a currently originated corresponding
   C-MCAST Join route, then that route MUST be withdrawn.  The C-MCAST
   route is withdrawn using the MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute.  If the
   upstream neighbor of a (S,G) or (*,G) route changes, and if there is
   a currently originated corresponding C-MCAST Join route, then the RT
   MUST be changed to identify the new upstream neighbor, and the route
   MUST be advertised on the BGP session to that neighbor.

3.2.  Receiving a C-MCAST Join Route by the CE Router

   When a CE router receives a C-MCAST route from its PE router, it
   checks to see if the route carries an IP Address Specific Route
   Target Extended Community whose Global Administrator field contains
   the address that the CE puts in the Next Hop field of the BGP UPDATEs
   it sends to the PE router.  If there is no such Route Target, the
   received route does not impact the CE's multicast state.  Otherwise,
   the received route is used to create or modify the corresponding
   (S,G) or (*,G) state in the multicast forwarding information base
   (FIB).  The CE-to-PE interface is stored in the outgoing interface
   list of the corresponding (S,G) or a (*,G) state.  If the C-MCAST
   route is received with the Route Type of Shared Tree Join, then the
   CE router attaches RP address to the corresponding (*,G) state.

   If the CE router is connected to the multiple PE routers, it is
   possible that it will receive C-MCAST routes with the same NLRI from
   multiple PE routers.  In this case, the CE router adds multiple CE-
   to-PE interfaces to its outgoing interface list, one for each PE
   router from which the given route was received.  (Note that a
   particular CE-to-PE interface is added only if the route from the
   corresponding PE identifies the CE in its IP Address Specific RT.)

Internet-Draft        BGP as an MVPN PE-CE Protocol         October 2013


   When the last C-MCAST route for a given (S,G) or a (*,G) is
   withdrawn, resulting in a state where BGP C-MCAST SAFI has no route
   for a given (S,G) or a (*,G) state, the CE router MUST remove all the
   interfaces learnt via BGP from the outgoing interface list.  If this
   results in an empty outgoing interface list then the CE router using
   PIM procedures MUST prune itself off the corresponding (S,G) or a
   (*,G) tree.

3.3.  Originating a C-MCAST Join Route at the PE Router

   The C-MCAST routes on a PE router are originated in BGP as a result
   of updates in the (C-S,C-G) or (C-*,C-G) state in the associated VRF
   of a PE router.  These states are created by BGP routes learnt from
   other PEs via the BGP MCAST-VPN SAFI [RFC6514], or from CEs via the
   C-MCAST SAFI.  Whenever a) a particular VRF on a particular PE router
   creates a new (C-S,C-G) or a (C-*,C-G) state, b) the selected
   upstream neighbor address identifies a CE, and c) the PE has a direct
   BGP session to the CE, on which C-MCAST SAFI is enabled, then the PE
   router MUST originate a C-MCAST Join route from the given VRF.  The
   PE router finds the upstream neighbor address based on the procedures
   of [RFC6513].

   The Route Type field of the NLRI is set to "Source Tree Join" if the
   corresponding state is (S,G), and to "Shared Tree Join" if the
   corresponding state is (*,G).

   The Multicast Source field of the NLRI of a C-MCAST Source Tree Join
   route MUST be set to the source address of the corresponding (S,G).
   The multicast source address field of the NLRI of a C-MCAST Shared
   Tree Join route MUST be set to the address of the RP that is mapped
   to the corresponding (*,G) state.

   The Multicast Group field of the NLRI of either kind of C-MCAST Join
   route MUST be set to the multicast group address of the (S,G) or
   (*,G) state.

   The PE router must put its own IP address in the Next Hop field of
   the C-MCAST Join route.

Internet-Draft        BGP as an MVPN PE-CE Protocol         October 2013


   The PE router MUST attach a particular RT to the C-MCAST Join route.
   This RT MUST be either an IP Address Specific RT or an IPv6 Address
   Specific RT, depending upon whether the address of the upstream
   neighbor is an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address.  In either case, the
   address of the upstream neighbor is placed in the Global
   Administrator field of the RT, and the Local Administrator field is
   set to 0.  (Compare to the "C-multicast Import RT" described in
   section 7 of [RFC6514].)  The "address of the upstream neighbor" MUST
   be the address that the upstream neighbor puts in the Next Hop field
   of BGP UPDATEs that it sends to the PE router.

   The PE MUST send the C-MCAST Join route on the BGP session to the CE
   that it has selected as the upstream neighbor for the (*,G) or (S,G)
   identified in the NLRI of the route.  Although not required for
   correctness, it is RECOMMENDED that the C-MCAST Join not be sent on
   other BGP sessions.  How this distribution constraint is met is a
   local matter.  Policy based filtering based on the RT is one possible
   way to meet the constraint.  Use of [RFC4684] is another.  Of course,
   a C-MCAST route originated by a particular PE is originated in the
   context of a particular VRF, and MUST NOT be advertised to a
   particular CE unless the interface between that PE and that CE is
   associated with that VRF.

   The C-MCAST Shared Tree Join is used to join the shared tree of an
   "Any Source Multicast" (ASM) group.  The C-MCAST Source Tree Join is
   used in both ASM mode and in "Single Source Multicast" (SSM) mode to
   join a source tree.  The C-MCAST Shared Tree Join can be used to join
   a BIDIR-PIM [RFC5015] multicast group, as long as the interface
   between the PE and the CE is a point-to-point interface.

   If a PE router deletes its (S,G) or a (*,G) entry in the context of a
   particular VRF, and if there is a currently originated corresponding
   C-MCAST Join route from that VRF, then that route MUST be withdrawn.
   The C-MCAST route is withdrawn using the MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute.
   If the upstream neighbor of a (S,G) or (*,G) route changes, and if
   there is a currently originated corresponding C-MCAST Join route,
   then the RT MUST be changed to identify the new upstream neighbor.

3.4.  Receiving a C-MCAST Join Route by the PE Router

   When a PE router receives a C-MCAST Join route from a CE router, it
   checks to see if the route carries an IP Address Specific Route
   Target Extended Community whose Global Administrator field contains
   the address that the PE puts in the Next Hop field of the BGP UPDATEs
   it sends to the CE router.  If there is no such Route Target, the
   received route does not impact the PE's multicast state.  Otherwise,
   the received route is used to create or modify the corresponding
   (S,G) or (*,G) state in the MVPN-TIB ([RFC6514]).  The PE-to-CE

   interface is stored in the outgoing interface list of the
   corresponding (S,G) or a (*,G) state.  If the C-MCAST route is
   received with the Route Type of Shared Tree Join, then the CE router
   attaches RP address to the corresponding (*,G) state.

   If the PE router is connected to the multiple CE routers, it is
   possible that it will receive C-MCAST routes with the same NLRI from
   multiple CE routers.  In this case, the PE router adds multiple PE-
   to-CE interfaces to its outgoing interface list, one for each CE
   router from which the given route was received.  (Note that a
   particular PE-to-CE interface is added only if the route from the
   corresponding CE identifies the PE in its IP Address Specific RT.)

   When the last C-MCAST route for a given (S,G) or a (*,G) is
   withdrawn, resulting in a state where BGP C-MCAST SAFI has no route
   for a given (S,G) or a (*,G) state, the withdrawal of the route has
   the (S,G) or a (*,G) prune semantics.  The corresponding MCAST-VPN
   route is withdrawn using the MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute.

4.  Pruning Sources off the Shared Tree

   Suppose a router, say R1, has originated a C-MCAST Source Tree Join
   A-D route for (*,G), and has identified another router, say R2, in
   that route's RT.  Under certain conditions, R1 may need to prune a
   particular source, say S1, off the (*,G) tree.  To do so, R1
   originates a C-MCAST Prune Source A-D route whose NLRI contains S1 in
   the multicast source field and G in the multicast group field.  This
   route MUST have the same IP Address Specific RT (identifying R2), and
   the same Next Hop field, as the corresponding C-MCAST Source Tree
   Join A-D route.  This route MUST be sent on the BGP session to R2.
   It is RECOMMENDED that it not be sent on other BGP sessions.  Note
   that either R1 is a CE and R2 is a PE, or vice versa.  The procedures
   are the same in either case.  When R1 no longer needs to prune S1
   from the (*,G) tree, R1 MUST withdraw the (S1,G) Source Prune route.
   If R1 changes the RT on the (*,G) Shared Tree Join route, it MUST
   change the RT on all the corresponding (S,G) Source Prune routes.  If
   R1 withdraws the (*,G) Shared Tree Join route, it MUST also withdraw
   all the corresponding (S,G) Source Prune routes.  When a router
   withdraws a Source Tree Join route for (*,G), it MUST withdraw all
   its Source Prune (S,G) routes.  A received Source Prune (S,G) route
   does not impact a router's multicast state unless there is a the
   router has also received a Shared Tree Join (*,G) route over the same
   BGP session.  However, a router should handle the case where one or
   more Source Prune routes are received before the corresponding Shared
   Tree Join route.  Further details will be provided in future
   revisions of this document.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document define a new SAFI called "C-MCAST SAFI".  IANA is
   requested to allocate a code point for C-MCAST SAFI.

7.  Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues
   inherent in the existing [RFC4271] and [RFC6514].
