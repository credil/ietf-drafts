Crediting loyalty points and collecting digital coupons or gift
certificates are common functions in purchasing and trading
transactions.  These activities can be generalized using the concept
of a "voucher", which is a digital representation of the right to
claim goods or services.  This document presents a Voucher Trading
System (VTS) that circulates vouchers securely and its terminology;
it lists design principles and requirements for VTS and the Generic
Voucher Language (GVL), with which diverse types of vouchers can be
described.
