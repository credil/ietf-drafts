Abstract

   Recently, transferring the signaling of mobile network over IP
   attracts lots of attention from people.  Telephone number based on
   E.164 or E.214 or SP is the traditional routing address for mobile
   network, but actually, E.164, E.214 and SP is not supported by MP-BGP
   protocol.

   This document presents a new way to support for routing the phone
   number based on E.164, E.214 or SP though MP-BGP, by extending the
   MP-BGP for the Phone Number Routing.  It can bring optimizing for the
   network architecture and improving efficiency.

1.  Introduction

   Currently years, more and more service of voice is transferred over
   IP network and people also pay attention to how the signaling
   transfers over IP network.  Signaling over IP network could probably
   bring more benefits, such as higher efficiency of bandwidth, lower
   cost, easy deploying and maintaining.

   Traditionally, the mobile network is linked directly though switch,
   addressing by telephone number and configuring manual route tables
   statically.  It may control the network much easier, however there
   could be much more work to update configuration of the routing tables
   when the network grows bigger and bigger.  The IP network is linked
   directly by routers, IP addressing and automatically updating the
   routing tables itself.  So there may need less manual work to update
   the routing tables.

   After combination of IP network and mobile network, phone number
   addressing is still used in mobile network.  Switches are
   communicating among each other though routers,using IP addresses and
   not connecting to other switch directly any more.

   According to figure 1 below, we can find some problems:

   1) Redundant procedure.  Switch B receives the IP packet and sends
   the IP packet to router B, during this time the packet experiences
   encapsulation, acquiring the phone number though analyzing BICC and
   many other protocols, checking the routing tables and at last
   capsulation.  Switch D repeats the same procedure.  It is unnecessary
   for switch B and D to process the packets.

   2) There exists a shortest path between router A and router E, but
   the shortest path cannot be guaranteed when the switch involved.

   3) It will acquire much more manual work to update the configuration
   of switch B and D when the network grows bigger and bigger.

   ER: Egress Router

   NH: Next Hop

   IP addr: IP address

   A/B/C/D: Router A/B/C/D

   A'/B'/C'/D': switcher A'/B'/C'/D'

   BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) was defined in RFC4271, which manages
   the routing information based on IPv4 protocol and has not support
   for IPv6, IPX, L3VPN and other network layer protocols well when
   crossing different ASs (Autonomous System).  MP-BGP (multiprotocol
   Extensions for BGP-4) was defined in RFC4760, which supports many
   network layer protocols such as IPv6, IPX, etc.  However, it is not
   supported to route E.164, E.214 and SP number information by MP-BGP.

   There are two attributes defined in MP-BGP protocol, which are
   MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI, both of them contain Address
   Family Identifier (AFI) used for identifying the network layer
   protocol and Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) carried the
   supplement to AFI.

   1) MP_REACH_NLRI (Multiprotocol Reachable NLRI) is used to carry the
   reachable destinations information and the next hop information used
   for forwarding to these destinations.

   2) MP_UNREACH_NLRI (Multiprotocol Unreachable NLRI) is used to carry
   the set of unreachable destinations.

3.  The new method to route phone number

   Comparing to the method shown in Figure 1, there is new method to
   route phone number though MP-BGP.  The procedure is shown in Figure
   2.

   1) According to the figure below, switch B, C and D are not involved
   in the signaling procedure, so that it can save bandwidth and
   simplifying the network architecture.

   2) The egress address matched with 1390123 in switch A is substituted
   for the IP address of switch E.

   3) Considering the changes of mapping relationship between phone
   number and IP address, the phone number routing table is
   automatically learning itself just like IP routing tables.

   4) It is required for the MP-BGP protocol to support large number of
   phone number routing information and should not impact the IP
   addresses.  Additionally, the MP-BGP is mature and widespread use.

   5) By configuring the parameters of NLRI, the E.164, E.214 and SP
   routing information can be supported to transfer though MP-BGP.

4.  Use cases and Requirements

4.1.  Use case1: United Location Server (ULS)

   The new solution based on United Location Server (ULS) integrates the
   distributed devices CMN, IPSTP and ENUMDNS into one device and then,
   chooses one ULS for global data center, other ULSs learn themselves
   automatically.  It is required to update the CMN to support IPSTP,
   ENUMDNA and MP-BGP so that ULSs and MP-BGP can communicate with each
   other.

   Requirements:

   1) CMN changes into ULS by updating.  ULS is required to support CMN,
   IPSTP, ENUMDNS and MP-BGP though Updating the CMN.

   2) MSS can access into ULS though CMN, and HLR accesses into ULS
   though IPSTP and data traffic accesses into ULS though ENUMDNS.

   3) The ULS can transfer the routing information based on phone number
   among each other though MP-BGP.

   4) Routing information of different traffic based on phone number is
   stored in the routing table of different VPNs.

4.2.  Use case2: Global data centers based on MP-BGP(BICC)

   In this scenario, Reflect Routers are involved in the network.  One
   Reflect Router is used to server as global data center and others
   update automatically themselves.  It is not suitable to build big
   network, but suitable for small network, due to the full connections
   among the province data centers.

           Figure 4: Global data centers based on BICC scenario


   Requirements:

   1) The data centers, HLR and digital network entities should support
   for MP-BGP.

   2) The data centers and HLR should have the capacity to communicate
   with MP-BGP.

4.3.  Use case3: Global data centers based on MP-BGP(SIP)

   In this scenario, several Reflect Routers are involved into the
   network.  One Reflect Router is used for global data center, and
   others update automatically themselves.  The location of the data
   centers is more wildly dispersed and it can be awareness of problems
   that happens to data centers for network.  It is unnecessary to
   establish full connections among the data centers, because of the
   retransmit mechanism in SIP protocol.

   Requirements:

   1) All the data centers and HLR are needed to support for MP-BGP.

   2) All the data centers and HLR should have the capacity to
   communicate with MP-BGP.

4.4.  Use case4: ENUMDNS based on MP-BGP

   In this scenario, the new solution is probably the same as standard
   IMS solution and is suitable for the network built by ENUMDNS.  There
   are many ENUMDNS used for global data center, however, it only need
   one ENUMDNS to be the global data center and others update
   automatically themselves.

5.1.  Phone Number Routing Information NLRI

   Phone Number Routing Information is exchanged in BGP UPDATE messages
   using the MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI attributes defined for
   MP-BGP [RFC 4760].  The AFI value 8 is used, and a new SAFI value
   needs to be assigned for phone number routing information.

   "Length of Next Hop Network Address" in the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute
   indicates the length of the Next Hop Address.

   "Network Address of Next Hop" in the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute SHOULD
   be set to the IP address of the originating speaker of the Phone
   Number Routing Information.  It is an IPv4 address if the length of
   Next Hop address is 4 octets, or an IPv6 address if the length of the
   Next Hop address is 16 octets.

   The NLRI field in the MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI is encoded as
   one or more 2-tuples of the form ( length, prefix ).  The length
   field indicates the length (in bits) of the prefix.  The structure of
   the Prefix field is as table 3 below:

                      +-----------------------------------+
                      |      Type  (1 octet)              |
                      +-----------------------------------+
                      |      RD   (8 octets)              |
                      +-----------------------------------+
                      |  Phone number prefix (variable)   |
                      +-----------------------------------+

                    Table 1: Phone number prefix field


   Type: indicates the type of the phone number prefix:

   1: E.164 number prefix

   2: E.214 number prefix

   3: SP number prefix

   RD: Route Distinguisher, encoded as described in [RFC 4364].

   Phone number prefix: a variable length prefix of the phone number.
   The prefix is encoded in Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) to represent a
   decimal phone number prefix.

5.2.  Phone Number Routing Capability Advertisement

Internet-Draft        E164/214 MPBGP announcement             March 2013


   In order for two BGP speakers to exchange the Phone Number Routing
   Information, they must use a BGP Capabilities Advertisement to ensure
   that they both are capable of properly processing such an NLRI.  This
   is achieved as specified in [RFC4760], by using capability code 1
   (multiprotocol BGP) with an AFI of 8 and a SAFI of TBD.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new NLRI called "Phone Number Routing
   Information".  A new SAFI value needs to be assigned for this new
   NLRI by the IANA.

   This document defines the Phone Number Routing Capability for BGP.
   The Capability code needs to be assigned by the IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   This extension to [RFC 4760] does not change the underlying security
   issues inherent in the existing BGP and [RFC 4760].
