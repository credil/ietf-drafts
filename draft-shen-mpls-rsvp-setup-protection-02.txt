Abstract

   RFC 4090 specifies an RSVP facility-backup fast reroute mechanism for
   protecting established LSPs against link and node failures.  This
   document extends the mechanism to provide so-called "setup
   protection" for LSPs during their initial Path message signaling
   time.  In particular, it enables a router to reroute an LSP via an
   existing bypass LSP, when there is a failure of the immediate
   downstream link or node along the desired path.  Therefore, it can be
   used to reduce LSP setup time in such a situation, or allow LSPs with
   strict paths to be established successfully when alternative paths
   are unavailable in the network or unable to be computed by ingress.

Internet-Draft            RSVP Setup Protection            February 2013


1.  Introduction

   In RSVP facility-backup fast reroute (FRR) [RFC 4090], the router at
   a point of local repair (PLR) of an LSP can redirect traffic via a
   bypass LSP upon a failure of the immediate downstream link or node.
   Such protection is normally established after the LPS has been set
   up.  This is because the PLR must know the label and address of the
   next-hop router (in the case of link protection) or those of the
   next-next-hop router (in the case of node protection), before it can
   select or signal a bypass LSP to protect the LSP.  The information of
   the label and the address is carried in a Resv message.

   Imagine a scenario where a new LSP is being signaled, but its Path
   message carries an EXPLICIT_ROUTE object (ERO) with a strict path
   that is statically configured or computed offline based on a topology
   that assumes no failure in the network.  In such a case, if a link or
   node along the path happens to be in a failure condition, RSVP
   signaling will stop at the router upstream adjacent to the failure.
   This will be the case even if there is an existing bypass LSP
   protecting the link or node for some existing LSPs.  In other words,
   this new LSP is not protected during this setup phase, i.e. the
   initial Path message signaling time.

   In this situation, the network would normally rely on IGP to update
   traffic engineering (TE) information throughout the network, and the
   router upstream adjacent to the failure to send a PathErr message to
   trigger the ingress router to compute and signal a new path.
   However, this approach may not always be possible, desirable, or even
   relevant in the following scenarios:

   1.  Static strict path.  As described above, if the ERO carries an
       explicit path with a sequence of strict hops that are statically
       configured or computed offline based on a topology assuming no
       network failure, the LSP will never be established.

   2.  LSPs with a strict requirement for setup time.  IGP TE
       information flooding, PathErr message propagation, and path re-
       computation and re-signaling may introduce a significant delay to
       LSP establishment.  This may impact on the setup time of services
       that have a strict requirement for it, such as on-demand
       transport services for real-time data.

   3.  Sibling P2MP sub-LSPs sharing a common link.  In this case, the
       new LSP is a sub-LSP of a P2MP LSP, and its desired path is
       supposed to share the failed link with an existing sibling sub-
       LSP, i.e. another sub-LSP of the same P2MP LSP, which is being
       protected by a bypass LSP.  If the new sub-LSP is rerouted via a
       different path, it will not be able to share the data flow over

       the bypass LSP with that sibling sub-LSP, creating unnecessary
       traffic flow in the network.

   This document extends the RSVP facility-backup fast reroute mechanism
   to provide so-called "setup protection".  During the initial Path
   message signaling of an LSP, if there is a link or node failure along
   the desired path, and if there is a bypass LSP protecting the link or
   node, the LSP will be signaled through the bypass LSP.  The LSP will
   be established as if it was originally set up along the desired path
   (aka. primary path) and then failed over to the bypass LSP after the
   failure.  After the failure is resolved, the LSP MAY be reverted to
   the primary path.  The mechanism is applicable to both P2P and P2MP
   LSPs.


2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


3.  Theory of Operation

   When an LSP is being signaled by RSVP, a Path message is sent hop by
   hop from the ingress router to the egress router, following the path
   defined by an ERO.  The setup protection mechanism in this document
   enables an ingress or transit router to reroute the LSP via a bypass
   LSP, if the router detects a failure of the immediate downstream link
   or node represented by the next hop in the ERO, called "next ERO
   hop".  In this case, the current router is referred to as a PLR.

   The mechanism is relevant when the Path message carries the "local
   protection desired" flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object [RFC 4090]
   and a new "setup protection desired" flag defined in this document
   (Section 3.1).

   On a PLR, the mechanism is only applicable when the next ERO hop is a
   strict hop, and in the case of node protection, the next-next ERO hop
   is also a strict hop.  A strict next ERO hop allows the PLR to
   unambiguously decide the intended downstream link or node along the
   desired path, and hence reliably detect its status.  In link
   protection, the strict next ERO hop also indicates the merge point
   (MP), i.e. the destination of the bypass LSP to be used to reroute
   the LSP.  In node protection, the strict next-next ERO hop indicates
   the MP.

   When performing setup protection, the PLR signals a backup LSP by

   tunneling Path message through the bypass LSP.  Like the Path message
   of a backup LSP in the normal facility-backup FRR ([RFC 4090]), this
   Path message carries an address of the PLR as the sender address in
   SENDER_TEMPLATE object.  In addition, the Path message also carries
   the information of the protected LSP (Section 3.2).  When the MP
   receives the Path message, it terminates the backup LSP, and re-
   creates the protected LSP.  If the MP is the egress router of the
   protected LSP, it terminates the protected LSP as well.  If the MP is
   a transit router of the protected LSP, it signals the LSP further
   downstream.

   Eventually, the LSP will be established end to end, with the backup
   LSP tunneled through the bypass LSP from the PLR to the MP.  The RSVP
   state on the PLR and the MP and the RSVP messages generated by these
   routers are no different than those in a post-failure situation of a
   normal facility-backup FRR.

   Later, when the failure is resolved, the PLR MAY revert the LSP to
   the primary path, in the same manner as the local revertive mode
   specified in [RFC 4090].

   The setup protection MAY be enabled and disabled on a router based on
   configuration.  For an LSP to be setup-protected, the mode MUST be
   enabled on both PLR and MP.  If it is enabled on the PLR but disabled
   on the MP, the MP SHOULD reject the Path message of the backup LSP
   and send a PathErr message, as described Section 3.4.

3.1.  New RSVP Attribute Flag

   In order for an LSP to explicit request for setup protection, this
   document defines a new "setup protection desired" flag in the
   Attribute Flags TLV of the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object [RFC5420].  It is
   carried in the Path message of the LSP, i.e. the protected LSP.

3.2.  New RSVP Attributes TLVs

   This document defines two new RSVP Attributes TLVs [RFC 5420].  They
   are used by a PLR to convey to an MP the original sender address in
   the SENDER_TEMPLATE object of a protected LSP.  Both TLVs are carried
   in the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object in the Path message of a backup
   LSP.

   Value

      Original sender address in the IPv6 SENDER_TEMPLATE object of the
      protected LSP.

3.3.  PLR behavior

   When a router has a Path message to send out, if the Path message
   carries the "local protection desired" flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE
   object and the "setup protection desired" flag in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES
   object, and if the next ERO hop is a strict IPv4 or IPv6 prefix, the
   router SHOULD validate the reachability of the prefix against routing
   tables, traffic engineering (TE) database, and/or any database that
   reflects the current status of the network topology.  If the prefix
   is reachable and is one hop away from the current router, the router
   should send out the Path message as it is.  Otherwise, there is a
   possibility that the link or node associated by the prefix has
   experienced a failure.

   The router SHOULD determine this by searching for an existing bypass
   LSP that is protecting the prefix.  If the protected LSP desires link
   protection, the destination of the bypass LSP (i.e.  MP) is
   considered as the router that owns the prefix.  If the LSP desires
   node protection with the "node protection desired" flag set in the
   SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object and the next-next ERO hop of the LSP is also
   a strict prefix, the MP is considered as the router that owns this
   prefix.

Internet-Draft            RSVP Setup Protection            February 2013


   If a bypass LSP is not found by the above criteria, the router MUST
   originate a PathErr with code = 24 (routing problem) and sub-code = 2
   (bad strict node).

   If a bypass LSP is found, the router MUST act as a PLR for setup
   protection, and reroute the protected LSP via the bypass LSP.  If
   multiple satisfactory bypass LSPs exist, the PLR MAY select one based
   on bandwidth constraints or local policies.  Specifically, if the
   protected LSP is a sub-LSP of a P2MP LSP, a bypass LSP that is
   protecting an existing sibling sub-LSP MUST be preferred, in order to
   minimize traffic duplication in the network.

   The PLR SHOULD NOT send the Path message of the protected LSP any
   further.  Instead, it MUST create a backup LSP, and send a Path
   message of the backup LSP to the MP via the bypass LSP.  The Path
   message is constructed by using the sender template specific method
   [RFC 4090].  In particular, it has the sender address in the
   SENDER_TEMPLATE object set to an address of the PLR.  It MUST also
   carry an LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object with a Protected LSP Sender
   IPv4 Address TLV or Protected LSP Sender IPv6 Address TLV.

   Upon receiving a Resv message of the backup LSP from the MP, the PLR
   SHOULD brings up both of the backup LSP and the protected LSP.  If
   the PLR is the ingress router of the protected LSP, the LSP has been
   set up successfully.  If the PLR is a transit router, it MUST send a
   Resv message upstream for the protected LSP, with the "local
   protection available", "local protection in use", and optionally
   "node protection" and "bandwidth protection" flags set to 1, in the
   RRO hop corresponding to the PLR [RFC 4090].  The PLR SHOULD
   originate a PathErr message with code = 25 (notify error) and sub-
   code = 3 (tunnel locally repaired).

   The PLR SHOULD also install a forwarding entry for the protected LSP.
   In the typical case, the forwarding entry should result in two
   outgoing labels for packets.  The inner label is the backup LSP's
   label, and the outer label is the bypass LSP's label.  However, the
   forwarding entry may result in one or no label, if either or both of
   the backup LSP and the bypass LSP have the Implicit NULL label.

   If the PLR receives a PathErr message when signaling the backup LSP,
   the PLR MUST NOT bring up the backup LSP or the protected LSP.  If
   the PLR is a transit router of the protected LSP, it MUST send a
   PathErr message upstream for the protected LSP.  Likewise, if the PLR
   receives a PathErr message of the backup LSP after the backup LSP and
   the primary LSP have previously been brought up, and the PLR is a
   transit router of the protected LSP, it MUST also send a PathErr
   message upstream for the protected LSP.

Internet-Draft            RSVP Setup Protection            February 2013


   When the PLR receives a ResvTear message of the backup LSP, the PLR
   MUST bring down both the backup LSP and the protected LSP.  If the
   PLR is a transit router of the protected LSP, it MUST send a ResvTear
   message upstream for the protected LSP.

   In any cases where the PLR needs to bring down the protected LSP due
   to a received PathTear message, an RSVP state time-out, a
   configuration change, an administrative command, etc, the PLR MUST
   also bring down the backup LSP by sending a PathTear message through
   the bypass LSP.

3.4.  MP behavior

   When an MP receives the Path message of a backup LSP, it MUST realize
   the setup protection condition based on the presence of Protected LSP
   Sender IPv4 Address TLV or Protected LSP Sender IPv6 Address TLV in
   LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object.

   If setup protection mode is disabled on the MP, it MUST reject the
   Path message, by sending a PathErr with code = 2 (policy control
   failure) to the PLR.

   Otherwise, the MP MUST terminate the backup LSP and re-create the
   protected LSP.  If the MP is the egress router of the protected LSP,
   it MUST also terminate the protected LSP.  If the MP is a transit
   router of the LSP, it MUST send a Path message downstream for the
   protected LSP.  The Path message has the sender address in
   SENDER_TEMPLATE object set to the original address of the ingress
   router, based on the above received Protected LSP Sender IPv4 Address
   TLV or Protected LSP Sender IPv6 Address TLV.  The Path message MUST
   NOT carry any Protected LSP Sender IPv4 Address TLV or Protected LSP
   Sender IPv6 Address TLV in LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object.

   The MP MUST allocate a label for the backup LSP, and distribute it to
   the PLR via Resv message of the backup LSP.  If the protected LSP is
   a sub-LSP of a P2MP LSP and there is an existing sibling sub-LSP
   whose backup LSP is tunneled through the same bypass LSP, the MP MUST
   allocate the same label as the sibling sub-LSP, in order to avoid
   traffic duplication at the PLR.

   When the MP receives a PathTear message for the backup LSP, it MUST
   bring down both the backup LSP and the protected LSP.  If the MP is a
   transit router of the protected LSP, it MUST send a PathTear message
   downstream for the protected LSP.

   In any cases where the MP receives or originates a PathErr or
   ResvTear message for the protected LSP, the MP MUST translate the
   message to a same type of message for the backup LSP and send it to

   the PLR.

3.5.  Local Revertive Mode

   When the failed link or node is restored, the PLR MAY revert the
   protected LSP to its desired primary path, by following the procedure
   of local revertive mode described in [RFC 4090].


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new flag for the Attribute Flags TLV, which
   is carried in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES Object of Path message.  This flag
   is used to communicate whether setup protection is desired for an
   LSP.  The value of the new flag needs to be assigned by IANA.

      Setup Protection Desired: TBD

   This document defines two new RSVP Attributes TLVs, which are carried
   in the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object of Path message.  The values of
   the new types need to be assigned by IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations discussed in RFC 3209, RFC 4090 and RFC
   4875 apply to this document.
