Using Authenticated Encryption with Replay prOtection (AERO) in Datagram
                    Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
                     draft-mcgrew-dtls-aero-00.txt

Abstract

   Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) is a communication security
   protocol that is attractive for use in constrained environments, in
   which it is important to minimize the data expansion added by the
   security protocol, and to support multicast security .  Authenticated
   Encryption with Replay prOtection (AERO) is a cryptographic technique
   that is well suited for use in DTLS, especially in these scenarios:
   it has minimal data expansion, avoids the need to manage implicit
   state, works well with multiple receivers and multiple senders, and
   provides strong misuse resistance.  This document describes how AERO
   can be used in DTLS.

1.  Introduction

   It is challenging to provide communication security in constrained
   environments.  Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) [RFC6347] has
   emerged as a communication security protocol of choice for such
   environments; for instance, a binding of DTLS to the Constrained
   Application Protocol (CoAP) [I-D.ietf-core-coap] has been defined,
   and it appears that a profile of DTLS will be "reasonably
   implementable" on constrained devices [DICE].  One important
   constraint is bandwidth, which is often a scarce resource in wireless
   environments, most especially when the transmitter or receiver is
   battery-powered.  This motivates the use of cryptographic transforms
   that minimize the size of the data overhead, that is, the additional
   bytes that must be communicated in order to add confidentiality,
   message authentication, and replay protection to each message.

   There is also interest in using DTLS for protecting multicast
   messages, which are commonplace in the Internet of Things
   environments [I-D.keoh-tls-multicast-security].  Standards work is
   underway to consider the use of DTLS record layer for this purpose
   [DICE] (though work on key management has not yet been chartered).
   For multicast applications, it is important to use cryptographic
   mechanisms that can easily and securely work with multiple receivers
   and with multiple senders.

   In addition to meeting the needs identified above, cryptographic
   transforms should be robust against implementation failure and
   misuse, and should not rely on implicit state, which is problematic
   to synchronize, especially when there are multiple senders and
   receivers.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

1.2.  Document History

   This section describes the evolution of this document as an Internet
   Draft, and it should be removed by the RFC Editor prior to
   publication as an RFC.

   This is the initial version of this note.  As it uses a cryptographic
   technique that was published recently, it may evolve over time as
   that technique is reviewed and experience is gained in its usage.
   Thus, while we encourage the implementation of this note as the best
   way to obtain experience with these techniques, also expect that

2.  Background

   Authenticated Encryption with Replay prOtection (AERO)
   [I-D.mcgrew-aero] is a cryptographic technique that provides all of
   the essential security services needed by a communication security
   protocol.  It is a stateful and self-synchronizing authenticated
   encryption method that provides protection from replay attacks as a
   side benefit.  Replay protection and authentication are provided
   through a single mechanism, in which a sequence number is encrypted
   along with a plaintext message.  If the ciphertext message is not
   tampered with, then this sequence number will be recovered by the
   decrypter, and verified to be valid.  If the ciphertext message is a
   replay of an earlier message, then the decrypter will detect this
   fact from the recovered sequence number.  If the ciphertext message
   is tampered with, or is crafted as a forgery, this fact will be
   apparent to the decrypter because the value that should be a valid
   sequence number is instead a pseudorandom value.

3.  Using AERO in DTLS

   AERO is an authenticated encryption mechanism, and it can be used
   through the standard AEAD interface [RFC5116], as defined in Section
   3.6 of [I-D.mcgrew-aero].  TLS version 1.2 defines how to use an AEAD
   method through the that interface, via the TLS GenericAEADCipher (see
   Section 6.2.3.3. of [RFC5246]).  This note follows these earlier
   specifications, except where otherwise noted.

   When AERO is used in DTLS, SecurityParameters.record_iv_length is
   equal to zero, since AERO algorithms do not require the use of a
   nonce or initialization vector.  Thus, the nonce_explicit field in
   the GenericAEADCipher structure has a length of zero.

   The AEAD key and plaintext are as specified in Section 6.2.3.3. of
   [RFC5246].

   The AEAD associated data is denoted as additional_data and is
   computed as

      additional_data = TLSCompressed.type + TLSCompressed.version +
      TLSCompressed.length;

   where "+" denotes concatenation.  The seq_num field is omitted from
   the additional_data because its authentication is not needed, since
   AERO detects replay attacks.

   In DTLS version 1.3, the epoch and sequence_number fields MUST be
   omitted from the DTLSPlaintext.  In DTLS version 1.2, those fields
   MUST be present.

      Rationale: With AERO, the epoch and sequence_number fields are not
      needed.  Omitting those fields enables each message sent to save
      eight bytes of overhead, a value that is significant for some
      applications, and it makes the on-the-wire data format identical
      to that of TLS does, which could simplify implementations.  We
      specify this omission for version 1.3, but not the earlier
      version, in order to avoid overloading the earlier version with
      complexity.  By omitting the seq_num from the additional_data
      computation, we enable an AERO implementation to work the same way
      for both versions 1.2 and 1.3 of DTLS, providing compatibility.

3.1.  Multicast

   DTLS-AERO is suitable for use in one-to-many scenarios such as those
   described in [I-D.keoh-tls-multicast-security].  In order to use
   DTLS-AERO it for many-to-many scenarios, in which more than one
   entity is using a single key for encryption, it would be necessary to

Internet-Draft                  DTLS-AERO                   October 2013


   modify the definition of DTLS in such a way that each receiver could
   unambiguously identify each sender.  This could be done by having a
   receiver use the source IP address and source port of the packet that
   carried the DTLS record, or by adding a new field to DTLS that works
   like the Synchronization Source (SSRC) identifier field in the Real-
   time Transport Protocol [RFC3550].  In either case, the fields that
   are used to identify the sender should be part of the authenticated
   data.  We emphasize that the change needs to be made to DTLS, and not
   to AERO, which is inherently capable of handling scenarios in which
   there are multiple devices performing encryption with a single key.

4.  IANA Considerations

   There are no requests to IANA at this time.

   A future version of this note will specify DTLS ciphersuites that
   make use of AERO.

5.  Security considerations

   The security considerations of AERO are discussed in Section 11 of
   [I-D.mcgrew-aero].

   AERO works well in multiple-receiver scenarios, and it provides
   automatic (re)synchronization of replay protection state between the
   sender and receivers, including "late joiners" to the secure session.
   It also works well for multiple-sender scenarios.  These topics are
   discussed in Sections 3.5, 6, and 11.4 of [I-D.mcgrew-aero].

   AERO is robust against misuse, which is especially valuable in
   virtual machine environments and in devices that may be subject to
   tampering.
