                 Mapping characters for precis classes
                    draft-yoneya-precis-mappings-03

Abstract

   Preparation and comparison of internationalized strings ("precis")
   framework [I-D.ietf-precis-framework] is defining several classes of
   strings for preparation and comparison.  In the document, case
   mapping is defined because many of protocols handle case sensitive or
   case insensitive string comparison and therefore preparation of
   string is mandatory.  As described in IDNA mapping [RFC5895] and
   precis problem statement [I-D.ietf-precis-problem-statement],
   mappings in internationalized strings are not limited to case, but
   also width, delimiters and/or other specials are taken into
   consideration.  This document is a guideline for authors of protocol
   profiles of precis framework and describes the mappings that must be
   considered between receiving user input and passing permitted code
   points to internationalized protocols.

1.  Introduction

   In many cases, user input of internationalized strings is generated
   by input method editor ("IME") or copy-and-paste from free text.
   Usually users do not care case and/or width of input characters
   because they are identical for users' eyes.  Further, users rarely
   switch IME state to input special characters such as protocol
   elements.  For Internationalized Domain Names ("IDNs"), IDNA Mapping
   [RFC5895] describes methods to treat these issues.  For precis
   strings, case mapping is defined as a process in precis framework
   [I-D.ietf-precis-framework], but width mapping, delimiter mapping
   and/or special mapping are not defined.  Handling of mappings other
   than case is also important to increase chance of strings match as
   users expect.  This document is a guideline for authors of protocol
   profiles of precis framework and describes the mappings that must be
   considered between receiving user input and passing permitted code
   points to internationalized protocols.

2.  Types of mapping

   This document defines two types of mapping.  One is protocol
   independent mapping that doesn't depend on protocol rules and the
   other is protocol dependent mapping that depend on protocol rules.
   This document defines some mappings in these mapping types.  Authors
   of protocol profiles of precis framework should need to give careful
   consideration to choice of mappings.

   Each mapping type is described in following sections.

3.  Protocol independent mapping

   Protocol independent mapping is a mapping that doesn't depend on
   protocol rules.

3.1.  Width mapping

   Fullwidth and halfwidth characters (those defined with Decomposition
   Types <wide> and <narrow>) are mapped to their decomposition mappings
   as shown in the Unicode character database [Unicode].

   Width mapping will increase backward compatibility with Stringprep
   [RFC3454] and precis framework [I-D.ietf-precis-framework].  Because
   in a Stringprep profile which specifies Unicode normalization form KC
   (NFKC) for normalization method, fullwidth/halfwidth characters are
   mapped into its compatible form.  If a precis framework profile
   specified NFKC (which is not recommended), width mapping might not be
   useful.

4.  Protocol dependent mapping

   Protocol dependent mapping is a mapping that depend on protocol
   rules.

4.1.  Delimiter mapping

   Definitions of delimiters in certain protocols are differ from each
   other.  Therefore, delimiter mapping table should be based on well
   defined mapping table for each protocol.

   One of the most useful case of delimiter mapping is when FULL STOP
   character (U+002E) is a delimiter as well as domain name.  Some of
   IME generates FULL STOP compatible characters such as IDEOGRAPHIC
   FULL STOP (U+3002) when users type FULL STOP on the keyboard.

4.2.  Special mapping

   Certain protocols have characters which need to map different
   character from precis framework defined mapping rule other than
   delimiter characters.  In this document, these mappings are named
   special mapping.  They are differ from each protocol.  Therefore,
   special mapping table should be based on well defined mapping table
   for each protocol.  Examples of special mapping are following;

   o  White spaces are mapped to SPACE (U+0020)

   o  Some characters such as control characters are mapped to nothing
      (Deletion)

   LDAPprep[RFC4518] defines the rule that some codepoints(Appendix B.4)
   are mapped to SPACE (U+0020).

4.3.  Local case mapping

   Local case mapping is case folding that depend on language context.
   For example, given there is upper case I in a user ID strings, you
   should care what's language context that this user ID depend on when
   this character is mapped into lower case character.  And if this
   depends on Turkish, the character should be mapped into LATIN SMALL
   LETTER DOTLESS I (U+0131) as this character's lower case.

   This document defines characters that need local case mapping based
   on the Specialcasing.txt [Specialcasing] in section 3.13 of The
   Unicode Standerd [Unicode] to solve such a problem.  Local case
   mapping targets only characters that get two different results to
   perfom just casefolding that is defined in the Casefolding.txt
   [Casefolding] and perfom special casefolding that is defined in the

Internet-Draft               precis mapping                 October 2012


   Specialcasing.txt then casefolding, because precis framework have
   casefolding.

   There are two types casefoldings defined as Unconditional Mappings
   and Conditional Mappings in the Specialcasing.txt.  Conditional
   mappings have Language-Insensitive Mappings that targets characters
   whose full case mappings do not depend on language, but do depend on
   context and Language-Sensitive Mappings that these are characters
   whose full case mappings depend on language and perhaps also context.

   Of these mappings, characters that Unconditional Mappings and
   Language-Insensitive Mappings in Conditional Mappings target are
   mapped into same codepoint(s) with just casefolding and special
   casefolding then casefolding.  But characters that Language-Sensitive
   Mappings in Conditional Mappings targets are mapped into different
   codepoint with them.  Therefore this document defined characters that
   are a part of characters of Lithuanian(lt), Turkish(tr) and
   Azerbaijanian(az) that Language-Sensitive Mappings targets as targets
   for local case mapping.

   A list of characters that need Local case mapping are as follows.

      Format:
      <Language>; <Codepoint>; <Lowercase>; <Comments>

      lt; 0049; 0069 0307; LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I
      lt; 004A; 006A 0307; LATIN CAPITAL LETTER J
      lt; 012E; 012F 0307; LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH OGONEK
      lt; 00CC; 0069 0307 0300; LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH GRAVE
      lt; 00CD; 0069 0307 0301; LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH ACUTE
      lt; 0128; 0069 0307 0303; LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH TILDE
      tr; 0130; 0069; LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE
      tr; 0049; 0131; LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I
      az; 0130; 0069; LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE
      az; 0049; 0131; LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I

   Section 6 "IANA Considerations" contains a template to registry these
   characters to IANA as precis local case mapping registry.

5.  Applying order of mapping

   Basically, applying order of mapping that this document describes
   aren't sensitive.  This section defines applying order of mapping to
   minimize effect of codepoint change by mappings.  This mapping order
   is very general and was designed to be acceptable to the widest user
   community.

   1.  width mapping

   2.  delimiter mapping

   3.  special mapping

   4.  local case mapping

   5.  precis framework

   Mappings that this document describes should be performed before
   precis framework.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  precis local case mapping registry

   IANA is requested to create a registry of precis local case mapping.
   In accordance with [RFC5226], the registration policy is "RFC
   Required".

6.2.  Template for precis local case mapping registry

   The following information is to be given when a new precis local case
   mapping rule is created.  The registration template is as follows:

      Language: language name

      Codepoint: Local case mapping that can be applied when this code
      point exists in the strings

      Local lowercase: The lowercase codepoint after performing local
      case mapping

      Comment: Character name of the code point

   Appendix C contains further discussion and a table from which that
   registry can be initialized.

   Martin Duerst suggested a need for the case folding about the
   mapping(map final sigma to sigma, German sz to ss,.).

   Pete Resnick et al. gave important suggestion for this document
   during at WG meeting.
