Abstract

   This file justifies and explains a DNS-like system for storing the
   correspondence between OID names and numbers, as well as some
   additional data that might be deemed useful. It is aimed to be
   implemented as an extension to current DNS mechanisms by the addition of
   some Resource Record and Query types.

1. Introduction

   This document proposes a DNS extension to allow the DNS mechanism to
   be used to store, ask for and retrieve OID information.

   Current DNS IN class schemene intends to trace between a tree-like
   structure (the domain names, rooted at . ) and a linear structure
   (the IP addresses, between 0.0.0.0 and 255.255.255.255 ) .  It has
   been extended to include IPv6 addresses, but these are a linear
   structure too (from :: to FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF ) .
   IN class also includes an inverse resolution (from linear IP to tree-
   like Domain Names) which is a tweak which really resolves between IP-
   like Domain Names and real Domain Names and also does not address
   fully issues like IP delegation in non-8bit boundaries (See RFC 2317
   ) .

   OID, instead, is a tree-like structure on its own, with (currently)
   three roots (0, 1 and 2) which can be super-rooted at . so this
   "skeleton proposal" intends to draw a way to map from tree-like
   structure to tree-like structure, fully forward and backwards,
   including also extra information that may be deemed useful.

   Also, this proposal allows OID owners to publicily state about
   canonical hostnames where information about their OIDs (or the
   organizations holding them) can be found.

   This document has been written taking into account [RFC5507].

2. Notes

   OID names and numbers are displayed in this document from root to
   leaf (from left to right), unlike the standard DNS IN class custom.

3. Classes

   This memo creates a new class, named OID.

3. Resource Record Types

   The new RR's proposed are those needed to store the mapping between
   OID names and numbers, and those to map between them and the extra
   info.  Some of the IN class RR's are also used here without
   modification, with just some minor meaning adjustment.

3.1 Types

   SOA: Similar to that of IN class, there will be two parallel SOA
   registers to maintain, one to start a number->name mapping zone and
   one to start a name->number mapping zone.

   OID: Similar to A or AAAA of IN class, will be used only on a
   name->number zone for name->number mapping. In case of clash with
   Class name, Class will be renamed OI.

   NAME: Similar to PTR of IN class, will be used only on number->name
   zone for number->name mapping.

   NS: Equivalent to that of IN class, will be used both in number->name
   mapping zones and in name->number mapping zones and points to OID-
   capable nameservers which hold the data for the current zone, or a
   delegated zone of the same kind of the current.

   DNS: Available in number->name zones only (these RR's can be reached
   from a name if you perform a name->number search first and a DNS
   search afterwards). This RR points to the canonical IN Class DNS
   hostname for the OID, whichever meaning is assigned to that concept
   by the OID zone owner.

   TXT: These are available in name->number zones only (these RR's can
   be reached from a number if you perform a number->name search first
   and a TXT search afterwards). These can include whichever information
   the OID owner deems necessary, much like IN Class TXT records.

   EQUIV: These are available in both kins of zones, and are similar to
   IN Class CNAME. It indicates that all searches that may be conducted
   after one OID number or name (depending on the zone kind) MUST be
   conducted after target OID number or name instead.  No mixture of
   numbers and names allowed: a name can only EQUIV anothe name, and a
   number can only EQUIV another number. This RR specifically claims
   that subtrees under the two OIDs are exactly equal.

   3.2 Example RR's

   ;This is ONE file ;NAME zone
    .iso.identified-
   organization.dod.internet.private.enterprise.rolamasao-org OID SOA
   (ns.rolamasao.org envite.rolamasao.org 2013040701 172800 86400
   2419200 604800)

   @ OID NS ns.rolamasao.org @ OID NS ns2.rolamasao.org

   @ OID TXT "Rolamasao.org related elements"

   @ OID OID .1.3.6.1.4.1.41434

   persona OID OID 1 individual OID OID 2 individual OID EQUIV persona

   ;This is ANOTHER FILE ;NUMBER zone
    .1.3.6.1.4.1.41434 OID SOA (ns.rolamasao.org envite.rolamasao.org
   2013040701 172800 86400 2419200 604800)

   @ OID NS ns.rolamasao.org @ OID NS ns2.rolamasao.org

   @ OID NAME
    .iso.identified-
   organization.dod.internet.private.enterprise.rolamasao-org

   @ OID DNS www.rolamasao.org

   1 OID NAME persona 2 OID NAME individual 2 OID EQUIV persona

4. Recursive search

   Due to exact tree-to-tree mapping, and to avoid long strings like
   ".iso.identified-
   organization.dod.internet.private.enterprise.rolamasao-org" it is
   allowed to make short references like these:

   ;INSTEAD OF @ OID OID .1.3.6.1.4.1.41434 ;IT IS ALLOWED @ OID OID
   41434

   ;INSTEAD OF @ OID NAME
    .iso.identified-
   organization.dod.internet.private.enterprise.rolamasao-org ;IT IS
   ALLOWED @ OID NAME rolamasao-org

   These not-starting-with-dot records will force recursive search.
   Similar mechanisms may be created for Queries.

   5. Roots for the trees

   Nominally the root of both trees will be . but all clients SHOULD
   know that the real roots are 0. 1. and 2. for numbers and itu-t. iso.
   and joint-iso-itu-t. for names.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations relevant to this document.

7.  IANA Considerations

   If this document were accepted by the IETF, IANA as result should
   reserve numbers for the corresponding Class, Query and RR types.
