       A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) usage for Trickle ICE
                  draft-ivov-mmusic-trickle-ice-sip-00

Abstract

   The Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol describes a
   Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal for UDP-based multimedia
   sessions established with the offer/answer model.  The ICE extension
   for Incremental Provisioning of Candidates (Trickle ICE) defines a
   mechanism that allows ICE agents to shorten session establishment
   delays by making the candidate gathering and connectivity checking
   phases of ICE non-blocking.

   This document defines usage semantics for Trickle ICE with SIP.

Internet-Draft             Trickle ICE for SIP              January 2013


1.  Introduction

   The vanilla specification of the Interactive Connectivity
   Establishment (vanilla ICE) protocol [RFC5245] describes a mechanism
   for NAT traversal that consists of three main phases: a phase where
   an agent gathers a set of candidate 5-tuples (source IP address and
   port, destination IP address and port and a transport protocol), a
   second phase where these candidates are sent to a remote agent and
   this gathering is repeated and then a third phase where connectivity
   between all candidates in both sets is checked (connectivity checks).
   Only then can both agents begin communication, provided of course
   that ICE processing has successfully completed.  According to that
   specification the three phases above happen consecutively, in a
   blocking way, which may lead to undesirable latency during session
   establishment.

   The trickle ICE extension defined in [I-D.ivov-mmusic-trickle-ice]
   defines generic semantics required for these ICE phases to happen
   simultaneously, in a non-blocking way and hence speed up session
   establishment.

   This specification defines a usage of trickle ICE with the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP).  In describes how and when SIP agents use
   the full and half trickle modes of operation, how they encode
   additional candidates and how they exchange them through use of SIP
   INFO requests.

   This document also defines a new Info Package for use with Trickle
   ICE.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification makes use of all terminology defined by the
   protocol for Interactive Connectivity Establishment in [RFC5245] and
   its Trickle ICE extension [I-D.ivov-mmusic-trickle-ice].  It is
   assumed that the reader will be familiar with the terminology from
   both of them.


3.  Half vs Full Trickle

   Trickle ICE defines a mode of operation called "half trickle".  With
   half trickle the first offer in a session contains all candidates and



Ivov, et al.             Expires August 3, 2013                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft             Trickle ICE for SIP              January 2013


   subsequent trickling occurs from the offerer in this first offer/
   answer negotiation.  Half trickle offers can hence be processed by
   both vanilla and trickle ICE agents, which offers an interesting
   advantage in cases where support for trickle cannot be verified prior
   to sending an offer.

   Unless agents are running within controlled environments or using
   GRUU, this would be the case with SIP.  In spite of mechanisms such
   as the one defined in [RFC3840], a SIP UA cannot rely on consecutive
   requests reaching the same destination.  An OPTIONS request querying
   capabilities can hence be routed to and answered by one entity and a
   subsequent INVITE by a completely different one.

   For all these reasons SIP UAs implementing trickle ICE SHOULD always
   perform half trickle, unless that behaviour is specifically
   overridden by configuration (which could be the case in controlled
   environments where every agent supports trickle ICE).

   [TODO maybe define a way for GRUU supporting agents to do full
   trickle]


4.  Encoding and Sending Candidate Information

   Trickled candidates and end-of-candidates indications sent by trickle
   ICE SIP UAs are transported as payload in SIP INFO requests sent
   within the already established dialog.  Such payloads are encoded in
   an SDP format as specified in [I-D.ivov-mmusic-trickle-ice].

   Since neither the "a=candidate" nor the "a=end-of-candidates" lines
   contain information matching them to a stream, this is handled
   through the use of MID [RFC3388] as follows:


         INFO sip:alice@example.com SIP/2.0
         ...
         Info-Package: trickle-ice
         Content-type: application/sdp
         Content-Disposition: Info-Package
         Content-length: ...

         a=mid:1
         a=candidate:1 1 UDP 1658497328 192.168.100.33 5000 typ host
         a=candidate:2 1 UDP 1658497328 96.1.2.3 5000 typ srflx
         a=m-line-id:2
         a=candidate:2 1 UDP 1658497328 96.1.2.3 5002 typ srflx
         a=end-of-candidates

5.  Info Package

5.1.  Overall Description

   This specification defines an INFO package meant for use by SIP user
   agents implementing Trickle ICE.  Typically INFO requests would carry
   ICE candidates discovered after the user agent has sent or received a
   trickle-ice offer.

5.2.  Applicability

   The purpose of the ICE protocol is to establish a media path.  The
   candidates that this specification transports in INFO requests are
   part of this establishment.  There is hence no way for them to be
   transported through the not yet existing media path.

   Candidates sent by a trickle ICE agent after the offer, are meant to
   follow the same signalling path and reach the same entity as the
   offer itself.  While it is true that GRUUs can be used to achieve
   this, one of the goals of this specification is to allow operation of
   trickle ICE in as many environments as possible including those with
   no GRUU support.  Using out-of-dialog SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY requests would
   not satisfy this goal.

5.3.  INFO Package Name

   This document defines a SIP INFO Package as per [RFC6086].  The INFO
   Package token name for this package is "trickle-ice"

5.4.  INFO Package Parameters

   This document does not define any INFO package parameters.

5.5.  SIP Option-Tags

   [RFC6086] allows Info Package specifications to define SIP option-
   tags.  This document therefore stipulates that SIP entities that
   support trickle ICE and this specification MUST place the 'trickle-
   ice' option-tag in a SIP Supported header field.

   When responding to, or generating a SIP OPTIONS request a SIP entity
   MUST also include the 'trickle-ice' option-tag in a SIP Supported
   header field.

5.6.  INFO Message Body Parts

   Entities implementing this specification MUST include SDP encoded ICE
   candidates in all SIP INFO requests.  The MIME type for the payload

   MUST be of type 'application/sdp' as defined in Section 4 and
   [I-D.ivov-mmusic-trickle-ice].


6.  Example Flows

   A typical successful (half) trickle ICE exchange with SIP would look
   this way:

Appendix A.  Open issues

   At the time of writing of this document the authors have no clear
   view on how and if the following list of issues should be address
   here:
   1.  Should we allow for full trickle if support can be verified
       automatically and confirmed for a gruu with [RFC3840].
   2.  Can we pick between MID and stream indices for stream
       identification.
