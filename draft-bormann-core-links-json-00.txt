               Representing CoRE Link Collections in JSON
                    draft-bormann-core-links-json-00

Abstract

   Web Linking (RFC5988) provides a way to represent links between Web
   resources as well as the relations expressed by them and attributes
   of such a link.  In constrained networks, a collection of Web links
   can be exchanged in the CoRE link format (I-D.ietf-core-link-format).
   Outside of constrained environments, it may be useful to represent
   these collections of Web links in JSON format (RFC4627).

   This specification defines a common format for representing Web links
   in JSON format.

1.  Introduction

   Web Linking [RFC5988] provides a way to represent links between Web
   resources as well as the relations expressed by them and attributes
   of such a link.  In constrained networks, a collection of Web links
   can be exchanged in the CoRE link format [I-D.ietf-core-link-format]
   to enable resource discovery.

   Outside of constrained environments, it may also be useful to
   represent the same collections of Web links in the widely used JSON
   format [RFC4627].  When converting between these two formats, as
   usual, there are many little decisions that have to be made.  If left
   without guidance, it is likely that a number of slightly incompatible
   dialects will emerge.

   This specification defines a common format for representing CoRE Web
   Linking in JSON format.

   Note that there is a separate question on how to represent Web links
   out of JSON documents, as discussed e.g. in [MNOT11].  While there
   are good reasons to stay as compatible as possible to developments in
   this area, the present specification is solving a different problem.

1.1.  Objectives

   (TBD: Convert the shopping list into plaintext)

   o  Canonical mapping

      *  lossless round-tripping

      *  but not trying for bit-preserving (DER-style) round-tripping

   o  The simplest thing that could possibly work

      *  Do not cater for RFC 5988 complications caused by HTTP header
         character set issues [RFC2047]

   o  Consider other work that has links in JSON, e.g.: JSON-LD, JSON-
      Reference [I-D.pbryan-zyp-json-ref]

      *  Do not introduce unmotivated differences

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119, BCP 14

2.  Web Links in JSON

   The objective of the JSON mapping defined in this document is to
   contain information of the formats specified in [RFC5988] and
   [I-D.ietf-core-link-format].  This specification therefore uses the
   names of the ABNF productions used in those documents.

   An application/link-format document is a collection of web links
   ("link-value"), each of which is a collection of attributes
   ("link-param") applied to a "URI-Reference".

   We straightforwardly map:

   o  the outer collection to an array of links

   o  each link to a JSON object.

   In the object representing a "link-value", each target attribute or
   other parameter ("link-param") is represented by a JSON name/value
   pair (member).  The name is a string representation of the parameter
   or attribute name (as in "parmname"), the value is a string
   representation of the parameter or attribute value ("ptoken" or
   "quoted-string"). "quoted-string" productions are parsed (i.e, the
   backslash constructions evaluated) as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-core-link-format] and its referenced documents, before
   placing them in JSON strings (where they may gain back additional
   decorations such as backslashes as defined in [RFC4627]).

   If a Link attribute ("parmname") is present more than once in a
   "link-value", its values are then represented as a JSON array of JSON
   string values; this array becomes the value of the JSON name/value
   pair where the attribute name is the JSON name.  Attributes occurring
   just once MUST NOT be represented as JSON arrays but MUST be directly
   represented as JSON strings.

   The URI-Reference is represented as a name/value pair with the name
   "uri" and the URI-Reference as the value.  (Rationale: While this
   does preempt "uri" as an attribute name, this usage is consistent
   with the use of "uri" in link-format query filtering
   [I-D.ietf-core-link-format]).

   (TBD: Should be do something special with the "hosts" relation?
   Should we include an anchor where the link-format does not explicitly
   set one?)

2.1.  Examples

   </sensors>;rt="index";title="Sensor Index",
   </sensors/temp>;rt="TemperatureC";if="sensor",
   </sensors/light>;rt="LightLux";if="sensor",
   <http://www.example.com/sensors/t123>;anchor="/sensors/temp"
   ;rel="describedby",
   </t>;anchor="/sensors/temp";rel="alternate"

       Figure 1: Example from page 13 of [I-D.ietf-core-link-format]

   becomes

   " [{"uri":"/sensors","rt":"index","title":"Sensor Index"},{"uri":"/se
   nsors/temp","rt":"TemperatureC","if":"sensor"},{"uri":"/sensors/light
   ","rt":"LightLux","if":"sensor"},{"uri":"http://www.example.com/senso
   rs/t123","anchor":"/sensors/temp","rel":"describedby"},{"uri":"/t","a
   nchor":"/sensors/temp","rel":"alternate"}] "

   (More examples to be added.)
