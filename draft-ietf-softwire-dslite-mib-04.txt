1. Introduction

   Dual-Stack Lite [RFC 6333] is a solution to offer both IPv4 and IPv6
   connectivity to customers crossing an IPv6 only infrastructure. One
   of its key components is an IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel, which is used to
   provide IPv4 connectivity across a service provider's IPv6 network.
   Another key component is a carrier-grade IPv4-IPv4 Network Address
   Translation (NAT) to share service provider IPv4 addresses among
   customers.

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for using with network management protocols in the Internet
   community. This MIB module may be used for configuration and
   monitoring devices in a Dual-Stack Lite scenario.


2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol
   (SNMP).Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in
   the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a
   MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD
   58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC
   2580 [RFC2580].

3. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC2119
   [RFC2119].

4. Relationship to the IF-MIB

   The Interfaces MIB [RFC2863] defines generic managed objects for
   managing interfaces. Each logical interface (physical or virtual)has
   an ifEntry. Tunnels are handled by creating a logical interface
   (ifEntry) for each tunnel. Each DS-Lite tunnel also acts as a virtual
   interface, which has a corresponding entry in the IP Tunnel MIB and
   Interface MIB. Those corresponding entries are indexed by ifIndex.

   The ifOperStatus in ifTable is used to represent whether the
   DS-Lite tunnel function has been originated. The ifInUcastPkts
   defined in ifTable will represent the number of IPv4 packets that
   have been encapsulated into IPv6 packets sent to a B4. The
   ifOutUcastPkts defined in ifTable contains the number of IPv6 packets
   that can be decapsulated to IPv4 in the virtual interface. Also, the
   IF-MIB defines ifMtu for the MTU of this tunnel interface, so DS-Lite
   MIB does not need to define the MTU for the tunnel.

5. Difference from the IP tunnel MIB and NAT MIB

   The key technologies for DS-Lite are IP in IP (IPv4-in-IPv6) tunnels
   and NAT (IPv4 to IPv4 translation).

   Notes: According to section 5.2 of RFC 6333 [RFC6333], DS-Lite only
   defines IPv4 in IPv6 tunnels at this moment, but other types of
   encapsulation could be defined in the future. So this DS-Lite MIB
   only supports IP in IP encapsulation, if another RFC defined other
   tunnel types in the future, this DS-Lite MIB will be updated then.

   The NAT MIB[I-D.ietf-behave-nat-mib] is designed to carry translation
   from any address family to any address family, therefore it supports
   IPv4 to IPv4 translation.

   The IP Tunnel MIB [RFC4087] is designed for managing tunnels of any
   type over IPv4 and IPv6 networks, therefore it supports IP in IP
   tunnels.

   However, the NAT MIB and IP Tunnel MIB together are not sufficient to
   support DS-Lite. This document describes the specific MIB
   requirements for DS-Lite, as below.

         In a DS-Lite scenario, the tunnel type is IP in IP, more
         precisely, is IPv4 in IPv6.  Therefore, it is unnecessary to
         describe tunnel type in DS-Lite MIB.

         In a DS-Lite scenario, the translation type is IPv4 private
         address to IPv4 public address. Therefore, it is unnecessary to
         describe the type of address in the corresponding
         tunnelIfLocalInetAddress and tunnelIfRemoteInetAddress objects
         which are defined in the IP Tunnel MIB for DS-Lite MIB.

         In a DS-Lite scenario, the AFTR is not only the tunnel end
         concentrator, but also a 4-4 translator. Within the Address
         Family Transition Router (AFTR), tunnel information and
         translation information MUST be mapped each other. But the
         tunnel entry defined in the IP Tunnel MIB and the NAT mapping

         entry defined in the NAT MIB are not able to reflect this
         mapping relationship. Therefore, a combined MIB is necessary.

   The implementation of the IP Tunnel MIB is required for DS-Lite. The
   tunnelIfEncapsMethod in the tunnelIfEntry should be set to
   dsLite("xx"), and a corresponding entry in the DS-Lite module will
   exist for every tunnelIfEntry with this tunnelIfEncapsMethod. The
   tunnelIfRemoteInetAddress must be set to "::".

6. Structure of the MIB Module

   The DS-Lite MIB provides a way to monitor and manage the devices
   (AFTRs)in DS-Lite scenario through SNMP.

   The DS-Lite MIB is configurable on a per-interface basis. It depends
   on several parts of the IF-MIB [RFC2863], IP Tunnel MIB [RFC4087],
   and NAT MIB [I-D.ietf-behave-nat-mib].

6.1. The Object Group

   This Group defines objects that are needed for DS-Lite MIB.

6.1.1. The dsliteTunnel Subtree

   The dsliteTunnel subtree describes managed objects used for managing
   tunnels in the DS-Lite scenario. Because some objects defined in the
   IP Tunnel MIB are "not access", a few new objects are defined in DS-
   Lite MIB.

6.1.2. The dsliteNAT Subtree

   The dsliteNAT subtree describes managed objects used for
   configuration as well as monitoring of AFTR which is capable of a NAT
   function. Because the NAT MIB supports the NAT management function in
   DS-Lite, we may reuse it in DS-Lite MIB. The dsliteNAT subtree also
   provides the information of mapping relationship between the tunnel
   entry and NAT entry by extending the IPv6 address of B4 to the
   natMappingTableEntry in the NAT MIB.

6.1.3. The dsliteInfo Subtree

   The dsliteInfo subtree provides statistical information for DS-Lite.

6.2. The Notification Group

   This group defines some notification objects for DS-Lite.

Internet-Draft  draft-ietf-softwire-dslite-mib-04.txt     November 2013


6.2.1. The dsliteTrap Subtree

   The dsliteTrap subtree provides trap information in DS-Lite scenario.

6.3. The Conformance Group

   The dsliteConformance subtree provides conformance information of MIB
   objects.

7. MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   This MIB module IMPORTs objects from [RFC4008], [RFC2580], [RFC2578],
   [RFC2863], [RFC4001], [RFC3411].

9. IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry, and
   the following IANA-assigned tunnelType values recorded in the
   IANAtunnelType-MIB registry:

      Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
      ----------        -----------------------
      DSLite-MIB         { transmission XXX }

      IANAtunnelType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

                 SYNTAX     INTEGER {

                            dsLite ("XX")        -- dslite tunnel

                            }

   Notes: As Appendix A of the IP Tunnel MIB[RFC4087] described that it
   has already assigned the value direct(2) to indicate the tunnel type
   is IP in IP tunnel, but it is still difficult to distinguish DS-Lite
   tunnel packets from normal IP in IP tunnel packets in the scenario of
   the AFTR connecting to both a DS-lite tunnel and an IP in IP tunnel.

10. Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure


Fu, et al.              Expires May 08, 2014                 [Page 18]

Internet-Draft  draft-ietf-softwire-dslite-mib-04.txt     November 2013


   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   Notification thresholds:  An attacker setting an arbitrarily low
   treshold can cause many useless notifications to be generated.
   Setting an arbitrarily high threshold can effectively disable
   notifications, which could be used to hide another attack.

   dsliteAFTRAlarmConnectNumber

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   dsliteTunnelStartAddPreLen
   dsliteNATBindMappingIntRealm
   dsliteNATBindMappingIntAddressType
   dsliteNATBindMappingIntAddress
   dsliteNATBindMappingIntPort
   dsliteNATBindMappingPool
   dsliteNATBindMappingMapBehavior
   dsliteNATBindMappingFilterBehavior
   dsliteNATBindMappingAddressPooling
   dsliteStatisticDiscard
   dsliteStatisticTransmitted
   dsliteStatisticIpv4Session
   dsliteStatisticIpv6Session

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826]. Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH [RFC5592]
   or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

Internet-Draft  draft-ietf-softwire-dslite-mib-04.txt     November 2013


   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
