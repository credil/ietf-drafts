                 Enhanced Sleepy Node Support for CoAP
                      draft-rahman-core-sleepy-00

Abstract

   CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained devices.
   These devices typically have some combination of limited battery
   power, small memory footprint and low throughput links.  It is
   expected that in CoAP networks there will be a certain portion of
   devices that are "sleepy" and which may occasionally go into a sleep
   mode (i.e. go into a low power state to conserve power) and
   temporarily suspend CoAP protocol communication.  This document
   proposes a minimal and efficient mechanism building on the Resource
   Directory concept to enhance sleepy node support in CoAP networks.

1.  Terminology and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document assumes readers are familiar with the terms and
   concepts that are used in [I-D.ietf-core-coap] and
   [I-D.ietf-core-link-format].  In addition, this document defines the
   following terminology:

   Sleepy Node
      A sleepy node is a CoAP client or server that may sometimes go
      into a sleep mode (i.e. go into a low power state to conserve
      power) and temporarily suspend CoAP protocol communication.  A
      sleepy node may also sometimes remain in a fully powered on state
      where it has the capability to perform full CoAP protocol
      communication.

   Non-Sleepy Node
      A non-sleepy node is a CoAP client or server that always remains
      in a fully powered on state (i.e. always awake) where it has the
      capability to perform full CoAP protocol communication.  The
      general operation of non-sleepy nodes are assumed to be well known
      and so are not explicitly spelled out in this document except
      where needed for clarity.


2.  Introduction

   The current CoAP approach assumes a minimal support of sleepy nodes
   as follows:

   o  [I-D.ietf-core-coap] defines CoAP proxies which can cache and
      service requests for sleepy CoAP servers.  A client explicitly
      sends a CoAP request (GET) to a proxy (identified by its IP
      address) while indicating the URI (of the resource of interest)
      associated to a sleepy CoAP origin server.  If the proxy has a
      valid representation of the resource in its cache it can then
      respond directly to the client regardless of the current sleep
      state of the origin server.  Otherwise the proxy has to attempt to
      retrieve (GET) the resource from the sleepy origin server.  The
      attempt may or may not be successful depending on the sleep state
      of the origin server.

   o  [I-D.ietf-core-link-format] and
      [I-D.shelby-core-resource-directory] defines a Resource Directory
      (RD) mechanism where sleepy CoAP servers can register/update

      (POST/PUT to "/.well-known/core") their list of resources on a
      central (non-sleepy) RD server.  This allows clients to discover
      the list of resources from the RD (GET /rd-lookup/...) for a
      sleepy server, regardless of its current sleep state.  Unlike a
      proxy, the RD stores only the URIs (i.e.  CORE Link Format) for
      other nodes, and not the actual resource representation.  The
      client then may attempt to retrieve (GET) the actual
      representation of the desired resource from the sleepy origin
      server.  The attempt may or may not be successful depending on the
      sleep state of the origin server.

   o  Lower layer (i.e. below the IP layer) support for sleepy nodes
      exist in most wireless technologies (e.g.  IEEE 802.11 (WiFi), and
      IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee)).  For example, most wireless technologies
      support limited functionality such as packet scheduling to account
      for sleepy nodes in their physical and MAC layer protocols.  These
      lower layer functionalities are not aware of any specific timing
      or operational aspects of application layer protocols like CoAP.


3.  Proposal

3.1.  RD Based Sleep Tracking

   The current CoAP approach to support sleepy nodes can be
   significantly improved by introducing RD based mechanisms for a CoAP
   client to determine whether:

   o  A targeted resource is located on a sleepy server.

   o  A sleepy server is currently in sleep mode or not.

   We define the following new parameters to characterize a sleepy node:

   o  SleepState - Indicates whether the node is currently in sleep mode
      or not (i.e.  Sleeping or Awake).

   o  SleepDuration - Indicates the maximum duration of time that the
      node stays in sleep mode.

   o  TimeSleeping - Indicates the length of time the node has been
      sleeping (i.e. if Sleep State = Sleeping).

   o  NextSleep - Indicates the next time the node will go to sleep
      (i.e. if Sleep State = Awake).

   These parameters are all server (node) level and are new parameters
   added to the RD URI Template Variables defined in

   [I-D.shelby-core-resource-directory].

   We also define a new lookup-type ("ss") for the RD lookup interface
   specified in [I-D.shelby-core-resource-directory].  This new lookup-
   type supports looking up the SleepState of a specified end-point.

   The three time based parameters (SleepDuration, TimeSleeping,
   NextSleep) can be based on either an absolute network time (for a
   time synchronized network) or a relative local time (measured at the
   local node).

   Following the approach of [I-D.ietf-core-link-format] and
   [I-D.shelby-core-resource-directory], sleep parameters for sleepy
   servers can be stored by the server in the RD and accessed by all
   interested clients.  Examples of using these parameters in a
   synchronous or asynchronous manner are shown in the following
   sections.

3.2.  Example of Synchronous RD Based Sleep Tracking

   Figure 1 shows an example of using RD based sleep tracking in a
   synchronous fashion:

   (1) SleepyNode-1 is awake and having previously discovered the local
   RD, stores its CORE link format in the RD (POST/rd) identified by its
   entry point (?ep=SleepyNode-1).  The sleep parameters are also
   updated as part of this step.

   (2)-(3) RD services the POST and stores the CORE link format and
   starts the sleep timers for this node.

   (4) SleepyNode-1 falls asleep.

   (5) A client is interested in temperature sensors in this domain and
   does a lookup on the RD.

   (6) The RD does a lookup and finds that SleepyNode-1 is the only node
   meeting the match and sends back the required info including the
   Sleep parameters.

   (7) From the sleep parameters, the client knows that the node is
   currently asleep and so internally schedules to send the GET request
   when the node wakes up (plus a small safety hysteresis).

   (8)-(9) Client sends GET request for temperature sensors and
   successfully receives the content as SleepyNode-1 is awake.

   "ss"), the client adds itself to the list of observers to get
   SleepState updates from RD for SleepyNode-1 [I-D.ietf-core-observe].

   (8)-(9) Client performs RD 'resource' lookup to find URI of
   temperature sensor of resource hosted on SleepyNode-1.

   (10)-(13) SleepyNode-1 prepares to goes to sleep and updates the
   SleepState in the RD.

   (14) RD notifies the client through previously established observe
   relationship.

   (15) Client application wants to get the temperature now but does not
   send the request as it knows SleepyNode-1 is currently sleeping.

   (16)-(19) SleepyNode-1 wakes up and updates the SleepState in the RD.

   (20)-(21) RD notifies the client through previously established
   observe relationship.

   (22)-(23) Client sends GET request for temperature sensors and
   successfully receives the content as SleepyNode-1 is awake.
