INTERNET DRAFT      <RFC Series Format Development>     October 18, 2012


1  Introduction

   Over 40 years ago, the RFC Series began in an environment that
   included handwritten RFCs, typewritten RFCs, RFCs produced on
   mainframes, and more.  This resulted in an understanding that however
   they were published, a common format that could be read and revised
   long in the future was required.  US-ASCII was chosen as that format,
   and since that time that format has proved to be persistent and
   reliable across a large variety of devices, operating systems, and
   editing tools.  That stability has been a continuing strength of the
   Series.  However, as new technology such as small devices and
   advances in display technology come in to common usage, there is a
   growing desire to see the format of the RFC Series adapt to take
   advantage of these different ways to communicate information.

   Since the earliest days of the series, authors and readers have
   suggested enhancements to the format.  However, no suggestion
   developed clear consensus in the Internet technical community.  As
   always, some individuals see no need for change and some press for
   specific enhancements.

   This document takes a look at the current requirements for RFCs as
   described in RFC 2223 [RFC2223] and more recently in 2223bis
   [2223bis], and recent requests for enhancements as understood from
   community discussion and various proposals for new formats including
   HTML, XML, PDF and EPUB.  Terms are defined to help clarify exactly
   which stages of document production are under discussion for format
   changes.  


1.1  Terminology

   ASCII = 7-bit ASCII

   Submission format = the format submitted for editorial revision and
   publication to the RFC Editor.

      *  might not be the same as the canonical formats (though it would
         make the workflow somewhat simpler for the RFC Editor if it
         were);

      *  will be converted to another format for further processing and
         publication if necessary

      *  Currently: .txt (required), XML (optional), NROFF (optional) 

   Revisable format = the format that will provide the information for
   conversion into an Publication format; it is used or created by the

   RFC Editor

      *  Currently: XML (optional), NROFF (required)

   Publication format = display and distribution format as it may be
   read or printed after publication process has completed.  

      *  Currently published by the RFC Editor: .txt, PDF, PDF that
         contains figures (rare)

      *  Currently made available by other sites: HTML, PDF, others

   Canonical format = the authorized, recognized, accepted, and archived
   version of the document.

   Metadata = Information associated with a document, such as defining
   its structure, presentation, topic or author.

      *  Currently: .txt

   Metadata = Information associated with a document, such as defining
   its structure, presentation, topic or author

2.  History and Goals

   Current RFC format rules as defined in [RFC2223] and clarified in
   2223bis.

      *  The character codes are ASCII.

      *  Each page must be limited to 58 lines followed by a form feed
         on a line by itself.    

      *  Each line must be limited to 72 characters followed by carriage
         return and line feed.

      *  No overstriking (or underlining) is allowed.

      *  These "height" and "width" constraints include any headers,
         footers, page numbers, or left side indenting.

      *  Do not fill the text with extra spaces to provide a straight
         right margin.  

      *  Do not do hyphenation of words at the right margin.        

      *  Do not use footnotes.  If such notes are necessary, put them at
         the end of a section, or at the end of the document.

INTERNET DRAFT      <RFC Series Format Development>     October 18, 2012


      *  Use single spaced text within a paragraph, and one blank line
         between paragraphs.        

      *  Note that the number of pages in a document and the page
         numbers on which various sections fall will likely change with
         reformatting.  Thus cross references in the text by section
         number usually are easier to keep consistent than cross
         references by page number.       

      *  RFCs in plain ASCII-text may be submitted to the RFC Editor in
         e-mail messages (or as online files) in either the finished
         publication format or in nroff.  If you plan to submit a
         document in nroff please consult the RFC Editor first.

   Precedent for multiple output formats is described in RFC 2223 and
   has been used for a few RFCs:

      Note that since the ASCII text version of the RFC is the primary
      version, the PostScript version must match the text version.  The
      RFC Editor must decide if the PostScript version is "the same as"
      the ASCII version before the PostScript version can be published.

   Neither RFC 2223 or 2223bis use the term metadata, though we
   currently refer to components of the text such as the Stream, Status
   (e.g. Updates, Obsoletes), Category and ISSN as metadata.  



2.1.  Issues driving change

   While some authors and readers of RFCs find the strict limits of
   character encoding, line limits, and so on to be acceptable, others
   find those limitations a significant obstacle to their desire to
   communicate information via an RFC.  With a broader base of authors
   currently producing RFCs and a wider range of presentation devices,
   the issues driving change may represent critical deficiencies in the
   current format.  

   While the specific points of concern vary, the main issues are:


      *  Line art, also known as ASCII art

      *  Character encoding

      *  Pagination

      *  Reflowable text

INTERNET DRAFT      <RFC Series Format Development>     October 18, 2012


      *  Metadata

   Each area of concern has people in favor of change and people opposed
   to it, all with reasonable concerns and requirements.  Below is a
   summary of the arguments for and against each major issue.  The
   potential requirements derived from these discussions are listed
   later in this document.


   Line art, aka ASCII art 

   Arguments in favor of keeping the current requirement for all
   diagrams, equations, tables, and charts include:

      *  Dependence on advanced diagrams (or any diagrams) causes
         accessibility issues

      *  Requiring ASCII art results in people often relying more on
         clear written descriptions rather than just the diagram
         itself.

      *  By their nature ASCII forces design of diagrams that are simple
         and discrete.

   Arguments in favor of replacing ASCII art with more complex diagrams
   include:

      *  State diagrams with multiple arrows in different directions and
         labels on the lines will be more understandable.

      *  Protocol flow diagrams where each step needs multiple lines of
         description will be clearer.

      *  Scenario descriptions that involve three or more parties with
         communication flows between them will be clearer.

      *  Given the difficulties in expressing complex equations with
         common mathematical notation, allowing graphic art would allow
         equations to be displayed properly.

      *  Complex art could allow for color to be introduced in to the
         diagrams.

   Two suggestions have been been proposed regarding how graphics should
   be included: one that would have graphic art referenced as a separate
   document the publication format and one that would allow embedded
   graphics in the publication format.

   Character encoding For most of the history of the RFC Series, the
   character encoding for RFCs has been ASCII.  Below are arguments for
   keeping ASCII as well as arguments for moving to UTF-8.

   Arguments for retaining the ASCII-only requirement

      *  Most easily searched and displayed across a variety of
         platforms.

      *  In extreme cases of having to retype/scan hard copies of
         documents (it has been required in the past) ASCII is
         significantly easier to work with for rescanning and retaining
         all of the original information.  There can be no loss of
         descriptive metadata such as keywords or content tags.

      *  If we expand beyond ASCII, it will be difficult to know where
         to draw the line on what characters are and are not allowed. 
         There will be issues with dependencies on local file systems
         and processors being configured to recognize any other
         character set.

      *  The IETF works in ASCII (and English).  The Internet research,
         design and development communities function almost entirely in
         English.  That strongly suggests that an ASCII document can be
         read by everyone in the communities and audiences of interest.

   Arguments for expanding to allow UTF-8: 

      *  In discussions of internationalization, actually being able to
         illustrate the issue is rather helpful, and you can't
         illustrate a Unicode code point with "U+nnnn".

      *  Want the ability to denote protocol examples using the
         character sets those examples support. 

      *  Will allow better support for international character sets, in
         particular allowing authors to spell their names in their
         native character sets.

      *  Certain special characters in equations or quoted from other
         texts could be allowed.

      *  Citations of web pages using more international characters are 
         possible.


   Arguments for mixed ASCII and UTF-8

 


<Brownlee & Flanagan>    Expires April 21, 2013                 [Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT      <RFC Series Format Development>     October 18, 2012


      * In order to keep documents as searchable as possible, ASCII-only
         should be required for the main text of the document and some
         broader UTF-8 character set allowed under clearly prescribed
         circumstances (e.g. author names and references).

   Pagination 

   Arguments for continuing the use of discrete pages within RFCs:

      *  Ease of reference and clear printing; referring to section
         numbers is too coarse a method

   Arguments for removing the pagination requirement:

      *  Removing pagination will allow for a smoother reading
         experience on a wider variety of devices, platforms, and
         browsers


         Reflowable text 

   Arguments against allowing for reflowable text:

      *  Reflowable text may impact the usability of graphics and tables
         within a document.

   Arguments for allowing reflowable text

      *  RFCs are more readable on a wider variety of devices and
         platforms, including mobile devices and a wide variety of
         screen layouts.

   Metadata and tagging 

   While metadata requirements are not part of RFC 2223, there is a
   request that descriptive metadata tags be added as part of a revision
   of the RFC format.  These tags would allow for enhanced content by
   embedding information like links, tags, or quick translations and
   could help control the look and feel of the publication format. 
   While the lack of metadata in the current RFCs does not impact an
   RFCs accessibility or readability, if other requirements are
   accepted, such as allowing UTF-8 in any part of an RFC, then having
   the ability to use metadata to provide an ASCII "translation" of the
   UTF-8 letters is also a requirement.

   Arguments for allowing metadata in the final output format:

      *  Allowing metadata in the final output format allows readers to
 


<Brownlee & Flanagan>    Expires April 21, 2013                 [Page 8]

INTERNET DRAFT      <RFC Series Format Development>     October 18, 2012


         potentially get more detail out of a document.  For example, if
         non-ASCII characters are allowed in the Author and Reference
         sections, Metadata must include translations of that
         information.  

   Arguments against metadata in the final output format:

      *  Metadata adds additional overhead to the overall process of
         creating RFCs and may complicate future usability.

2.2.  Further considerations

   Some of the discussion beyond the issues described above went into
   potential solutions.  Those solutions and the debate around them
   added a few more points to the potential requirements for a change in
   RFC Format.  In particular, discussing whether a change in format
   should also include the creation and ongoing support of specific RFC
   authoring and/or rendering tools and whether the Publication format
   should be in a format that must go through a rendering agent to be
   readable.

   Creation and use of RFC-specific tools 

   Arguments against community-supported RFC-specific tools:

      *  We cannot be so unique in our needs that we can't use
         commercial tools.

      *  Ongoing support for these tools adds a greater level of
         instability to the ongoing availability of the RFC Series
         through the decades.

      *  The community that would support these tools cannot be relied
         on to be as stable and persistent as the Series itself.

         Arguments in support of community-supported RFC-specific tools:

      *  Given the community that would be creating and supporting these
         tools, there would be greater control and flexibility over the
         tools and how they implement the RFC format requirements.

      *  Community supported tools currently exist and are in extensive
         use within the community, so it would be most efficient to
         build on that base.

         Markup Language

         Arguments in support of a markup language as the revisable
 


<Brownlee & Flanagan>    Expires April 21, 2013                 [Page 9]

INTERNET DRAFT      <RFC Series Format Development>     October 18, 2012


         format:

      *  Having a markup language such as XML or HTML allows for greater
         flexibility in creating a variety of display formats, with a
         greater likelihood of similarity between them.

   Arguments against a markup language as the revisable format:

      *  Having the publication format be in code instead of in a simple
         text-formatting structure ties us in to specific tools and/or
         tool support going forward.

2.3.  RFC Editor goals

   Today, each RFC has an nroff file created prior to publication.  For
   RFCs revised using an XML file, this file is created by converting
   XML to nroff at the final step.  As more documents are submitted with
   an XML file (so far in 2012, 66% of approved I-Ds were submitted with
   an XML file), this conversion is problematic in terms of time spent
   and data lost from XML.  Making this process more efficient is
   strongly desired by the RFC Editor.


3.  Format requirements

   Understanding the major pain points and balancing them with the goal
   of long-term viability of the documents and the requirements of a
   broad community base brings us to a review of what must be kept of
   the original requirements, what new requirements must be added, and
   what requirements can be retired.

   There are several components of the original format requirements that
   must be retained to ensure the ongoing continuity, reliability and
   readability of the Series:

      *  While several publication formats must be allowed, the
         publication formats must include support for plain-text
         printing.

      *  RFCs must not change, regardless of format, once published 

      *  The Boilerplate and overall structure of the RFC must be in
         accordance with current RFC and Style Guide requirements (see
         [RFC5741])

         Issues such as overstriking, page justification, hyphenation,
         and spacing will be defined in the RFC Style Guide. [link
         required?]
 


<Brownlee & Flanagan>    Expires April 21, 2013                [Page 10]

INTERNET DRAFT      <RFC Series Format Development>     October 18, 2012


   In addition to those ongoing requirements, the following must be
   added:

      *  There must be support for Accessibility (this has significant
         implications) [WCAG20]

      *  The Submission and Publication formats need to permit
         extensible  encoding, for the addition of labeled metadata.

      *  UTF-8/Unicode in the header and references and associated ASCII
         translations recorded in the metadata (that translation will be
         used in the ASCII text version of the RFC) 

      *  If descriptive metadata within a document is allowed, defining
         the accepted set of metadata tags will become part of the RFC
         Style Guide.

      *  Graphics may include ASCII art and SVG line art.  Color will
         not be accepted; RFCs must correctly display in monochrome.

      *  RFC must be readable self-contained (i.e. must not contain
         normative external links, figures, etc.).

      *  Fonts are restricted to fixed-width fonts.

   The goals of the RFC Editor in considering how the formats for
   Submission and Publication should change include:

      *  The final conversion of all submitted documents to nroff should
         be replaced by using an accepted revisable format throughout
         the process.

      *  Support for a limited set of submission and publication formats
         as opposed to supporting all formats possible.

      *  Some proposed solutions allow for multiple files to be
         submitted for later consolidation.  The RFC Editor would prefer
         to work with the minimal number of files required for each
         submission (not a tar ball of several discrete components).

      *  Tools should support the submission and format error checking
         on the part of the authors of Submission Format documents 


   Some of the original requirements may be removed from consideration:

      *  Pagination (" Each page must be limited to 58 lines followed by
         a form feed on a line by itself.")

INTERNET DRAFT      <RFC Series Format Development>     October 18, 2012


      *  Maximum line length ("Each line must be limited to 72
         characters followed by carriage return and line feed.")
