Internet-Draft       URL Signing and Validation              July 2012




Abstract


   In CDNI deployment, URL signing mechanism should continue to
   function for content access restriction. Previous CDNI documents
   have described the basic of URL signing. However, in some cases that
   the key cannot be distributed from the Authoritative CDN to the
   Delivering CDN, the URL validation requirement cannot be fulfilled.
   This document gives some supplementary description concerning URL
   signing and validation mechanism in case of DNS based Request
   Routing, and as a result, a compliment for authorization object in
   metadata interface is presented.

Internet-Draft       URL Signing and Validation              July 2012



1. Introduction


   CSPs may perform per-request authentication decision to restrict
   content access to a particular user, and it should continue to
   function in CDNI environments. Previous CDNI documents have
   described basic of URL signing. However, different types of URL
   signing have been used in real applications. In some cases the key
   cannot be distributed from the Authoritative CDN to the Delivering
   CDN, so the URL validation requirements cannot be fulfilled. This
   document gives some additional description concerning URL signing
   and validation mechanism in case of DNS based Request Routing. For
   this consideration is likely to affect the CDNI interface, as a
   result, a discussion for the options of authorization object in
   metadata interface for URL signing is provided for discussion.


1.1. Terminology

   This document reuses the terminology defined in [I-D.draft-cdni-
   problem-statement] and [I-D. draft-cdni-framework].

1.2. Abbreviations

   o UE: User Equipment
   o MSISDN: Mobile Subscriber ISDN Number


2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

3. URL Signing


   CSP usually need to restrict access to content to protect the
   copyright. To full this requirement, a usually used method is to
   embed the UE's IP address and a timestamp within the URL, and then
   validated by the content server. Because URL is inherently open, it
   can be modified manually, shared with unauthorized users, or

Internet-Draft       URL Signing and Validation              July 2012


   continue to access beyond the time limit. Therefore a good way is to
   attach an encrypted signature to the URL, which is signed for a
   particular user. Once receiving the HTTP request, the content server
   could validate the signature with the authorization parameters
   extracting from the request URL as inputs. Only if the computation
   result matches with the signature in the request URL, the user's
   request has legitimate access to the content.

   The authorization parameters must be agreed upon between the URL
   signer and validating entity (e.g., source IP address, MSISDN
   provided by NSP's Internet Gateway, allotted timestamp or time
   period). The following is an example of URL signing rules used for
   the Mobile Video Service in China Mobile.

   Protocal://<host>:<port>/<path>/<filename>?<param1>=<value1>&...&<par
   amN>=<valueN>&<hash>=<hash>

   Example1:
   rtsp://video.exmaple.com/test.3gp?msisdn=13888888888&ip=10.25.113.32
   &key=D832AC16CC54615E313723538AF6F278

   Example2:
   http://video.example.com/test.mov?msisdn=13888888888&timestamp=20120
   301122549&ip=10.5.7.34&key=5E313T23538AF6F234E96M3X53EA9H46



   To generate the signature and validate the URL, it relies on a set
   of secret keys that share between the URL signer and validating
   entity. There are two types of URL signing:
   O Symmetric key URL signing: the same key is adopted for both
   signature generation and validation;
   O Asymmetric key URL signing: a key pair consisting of a public key
   and private key is adopted, where the private key is used for
   signing and the public key is used for validation.


4. URL Validating in CDNI Deployment

   In CDNI deployment, a signed URL could be provided by CSP to the
   user agent during website navigation. Under condition of DNS request

   routing, the user's HTTP request is redirected by the Authoritative
   CDN via DNS, and finally the request is sent from user to a
   surrogate of the Delivering CDN, where the URL validation should be
   made before content delivering. The validation for content URLs
   should be supported by the upstream CDN and downstream CDN, and the
   validating entity must obtain the key.

   However, in the case of symmetric URL signing, the keys and the
   signing algorithm (eg., which parameters are used for the hash value
   computation) are usually top-level secret of CSP. In most cases,
   CSPs only share keys and algorithms with the Authoritative CDN that
   it has a business relationship with. CSPs usually don't allow the
   symmetric keys distributed to the Delivering CDN that it has no
   direct relationship with. On this condition, the Delivering CDN
   could not obtain enough authorization information via current
   metadata interface.


   Therefore, two types of URL validation mechanism should be supported.

   Case 1: Validating by the Delivering CDN.

   In this case, the key could be distributed from the Authoritative
   CDN to the Delivering CDN. The URL validation is made by the
   Delivering CDN. After DNS based request routing process, the user's
   request is sent to a surrogate of the Delivering CDN. Depending on
   the configured rules obtained from the metadata interface, the
   Delivering CDN determines that this URL should be validated by
   itself. It then makes the key hash computing with parameters
   extracting from the URL and the keys. If the computing result is
   matched with the signature embedded in URL and the content has
   already been distributed to the Delivering CDN, it directly delivers
   the content data to the user agent. If the Delivering CDN missed, it
   just acts as a proxy and requests the content from the Authoritative
   CDN. If the signature is not matched, the Delivering CDN should
   respond to the user's content request with a 403 Forbidden status
   code.

   Figure 1. URL Validating by the Delivering CDN


   Case 2: Validating by the Authoritative CDN.

   In this case, the URL validation is made by the Authoritative CDN,
   and it does not need key provisioning and distribution. After DNS
   based request routing process, content request is sent to a
   surrogate of the Delivering CDN. Depending on the configured rules
   obtained from the metadata interface, the Delivering CDN determines
   that this URL should be validated by the Authoritative CDN. It then
   directly transmits the request to the Authoritative CDN. The
   Authoritative CDN makes the hash computing with parameters
   extracting from the URL and the keys.

   If the computing result is matched with the signature embedded in
   URL, which means that this request is from a valid user, a HTTP 200
   OK message is sent from the Authoritative CDN to the Delivering CDN,
   the Delivering CDN then delivers the content data to the user agent.
   If the signature is not matched, the Authoritative CDN should
   respond to the content request with a 403 Forbidden status code.
   Upon receiving this message from the Authoritative CDN, the
   Delivering CDN also send a response message with a 403 Forbidden
   status code to the user.

5. Authorization Object

   The authorization object describes an authorization type and the
   corresponding parameters. It provides information for content
   delivery such that the user agent can be authenticated when
   requesting content from the Delivering CDN.
   To support the above different type of validation mode (by the
   Delivering CDN or the Authoritative CDN), the authorization object
   should contains the following fields:
   O  type - a string containing the authorization type "url-signing"
   or "url-token".
   O  validation -a string indicating which entity to make the
   validation (e.g., "Authoritative CDN", "Delivering CDN").
   O  algo - a string containing the signature algorithm (e.g. "md5",
   "sha-1", etc.).
   O  symmetric - a boolean if true, URL signing uses symmetric keys,
   otherwise asymmetric.

Internet-Draft       URL Signing and Validation              July 2012


   O  key - a number containing the public key for verifying signatures,
   only valid if "symmetric" field is set to false.


   The following is an example of authorization object in case of URL
   validating by the Authoritative CDN. It can be seen that only the
   validation information needs to be transmitted via the metadata
   interface, other fields could be blank.

   {
   "metadataType": "Authorization",
   "object": {
   "type": "url-signing",
   "validation": "Authoritative CDN",
   "algorithm": "",
   "symmetric": "",
   "key": ""
