              Definitions of Textual Conventions (TCs) for
          Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) Management
                        draft-ietf-bfd-tc-mib-01



Abstract

   This draft defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module which
   contains Textual Conventions to represent commonly used Bidirectional
   Forwarding Detection (BFD) management information.  The intent is
   that these TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS (TCs) will be imported and used in BFD
   related MIB modules that would otherwise define their own
   representations.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a MIB module which contains Textual Conventions
   for Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocols.  These
   Textual Conventions should be imported by MIB modules which manage
   BFD protocols.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

        "BFD authentication key type.
    
         A BfdSessionAuthenticationKeyTC is always interpreted within
         the context of an BfdSessAuthenticationTypeTC value.  Every
         usage of the BfdSessionAuthenticationTypeTC textual
         convention is required to specify the the
         BfdSessionAuthenticationKeyTC object that provides the
         context.  It is suggested that the
         BfdSessionAuthentcationTypeTC object be logically registered
         before the object(s) that use the
         BfdSessionAuthenticationKeyTC textual convention, if they
         appear in the same logical row.

         The value of a BfdSessionAuthenticationKeyTC must always be
         consistent with the value of the associated
         BfdSessionAuthencationTypeTC object.  Attempts to set a
         BfdSessionAuthenticationKeyTC object to a value inconsistent
         with the associated BfdSessionAuthenticationTypeTC must fail
         with an inconsistentValue error.

         The following size constraints for a
         BfdSessionAuthenticationKeyTC object are defined for the
         associated BfdSessionAuthenticationTypeTC values show below:

         noAuthentication(-1): SIZE(0)
         reserved(0): SIZE(0)
         simplePassword(1): SIZE(1..16)
         keyedMD5(2): SIZE(16)
         meticulousKeyedMD5(3): SIZE(16)

         When this textual convention is used as the syntax of an
         index object, there may be issues with the limit of 128
         sub-identifiers specified in SMIv2, STD 58.  In this case,
         the object definition MUST include a 'SIZE' clause to limit
         the number of potential instance sub-identifiers; otherwise
         the applicable constraints MUST be stated in the appropriate
         conceptual row DESCRIPTION clauses, or in the surrounding
         documentation if there is no single DESCRIPTION clause that
         is appropriate."

4.  Security Considerations

   This module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other BFD
   MIB modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects.  Therefore, this document has
   no impact on the security of the Internet.


5.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

           Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
           ----------        -----------------------

           bfdTCStdMib       { mib-2 XXX }

   [RFC Editor Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.]
