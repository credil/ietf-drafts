   enhanced Optical Transport Networking (OTN) flexibility. Several 
   recent documents have proposed ways to modify GMPLS signaling 
   protocols to support these new OTN features.  

   It is important that a single solution is developed for use in GMPLS 
   signaling and routing protocols. This solution must support ODUk 
   multiplexing capabilities, address all of the new features, be 
   acceptable to all equipment vendors, and be extensible considering 
   continued OTN evolution.  

   This document describes the extensions to the Generalized Multi-
   Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) signaling to control the evolving 
   Optical Transport Networks (OTN) addressing ODUk multiplexing and new 
   features including ODU0, ODU4, ODU2e and ODUflex.

1. Introduction 

   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [RFC3945] extends 
   MPLS to include Layer-2 Switching (L2SC), Time-Division Multiplex 
   (e.g., SONET/SDH, PDH, and ODU), Wavelength (OCh, Lambdas) Switching, 
   and Spatial Switching (e.g., incoming port or fiber to outgoing port 
   or fiber). [RFC3471] presents a functional description of the 
   extensions to Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) signaling 
   required to support Generalized MPLS.  RSVP-TE-specific formats and 
   mechanisms and technology specific details are defined in [RFC3473]. 

   With the evolution and deployment of G.709 technology, it is 
   necessary that appropriate enhanced control technology support be 
   provided for G.709. [RFC4328] describes the control technology 
   details that are specific to foundation G.709 Optical Transport 
   Networks (OTN), as specified in the ITU-T Recommendation G.709 [G709-
   V1], for ODUk deployments without multiplexing. 

   In addition to increasing need to support ODUk multiplexing, the 
   evolution of OTN has introduced additional containers and new 
   flexibility. For example, ODU0, ODU2e, ODU4 containers and ODUflex 
   are developed in [G709-V3]. 

   In addition, the following issues require consideration: 

      -  Support for Hitless Adjustment of ODUflex (GFP) (HAO), which is 
         defined in [G.7044]. 

      -  Support for Tributary Port Number. The Tributary Port Number 
         has to be negotiated on each link for flexible assignment of 
         tributary ports to tributary slots in case of LO-ODU over HO-
         ODU (e.g., ODU2 into ODU3).  

   Therefore, it is clear that [RFC4328] has to be updated or superceded 
   in order to support ODUk multiplexing, as well as other ODU 
   enhancements introduced by evolution of OTN standards.  

   This document updates [RFC4328] extending the G.709 ODUk traffic 
   parameters and also presents a new OTN label format which is very 
   flexible and scalable.

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",   
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this   
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

3. GMPLS Extensions for the Evolving G.709 - Overview 

   New features for the evolving OTN, for example, new ODU0, ODU2e, ODU4 
   and ODUflex containers are specified in [G709-V3]. The corresponding 
   new signal types are summarized below: 

      -  Optical Channel Transport Unit (OTUk): 
         . OTU4 

      -  Optical Channel Data Unit (ODUk): 
         . ODU0 
         . ODU2e 
         . ODU4 
         . ODUflex 

   A new Tributary Slot Granularity (TSG) (i.e., 1.25 Gbps) is also 
   described in [G709-V3]. Thus, there are now two TS granularities for 
   the foundation OTN ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3 containers. The TS granularity 
   at 2.5 Gbps is used on legacy interfaces while the new 1.25 Gbps is 
   used on the new interfaces. 

   In addition to the support of ODUk mapping into OTUk (k = 1, 2, 3, 4), 
   the evolving OTN [G.709-V3] encompasses the multiplexing of ODUj (j = 
   0, 1, 2, 2e, 3, flex) into an ODUk (k > j), as described in Section 
   3.1.2 of [OTN-FWK]. 

   Virtual Concatenation (VCAT) of OPUk (OPUk-Xv, k = 1/2/3, X = 1...256) 
   is also supported by [OTN-V3]. Note that VCAT of OPU0 / OPU2e / OPU4 
   / OPUflex is not supported per [OTN-V3]. 

   [RFC4328] describes GMPLS signaling extensions to support the control 
   for G.709 Optical Transport Networks (OTN) [G709-V1]. However, 
   [RFC4328] needs to be updated because it does not provide the means 
   to signal all the new signal types and related mapping and 
   multiplexing functionalities. Moreover, it supports only the 
   deprecated auto-MSI mode which assumes that the Tributary Port Number 
   is automatically assigned in the transmit direction and not checked 
   in the receive direction. 

   This document extends the G.709 traffic parameters described in 
   [RFC4328] and presents a new flexible and scalable OTN label format.

   Additionally, procedures about Tributary Port Number assignment 
   through control plane are also provided in this document. 

    

4. Generalized Label Request  

   The Generalized Label Request, as described in [RFC3471], carries the 
   LSP Encoding Type, the Switching Type and the Generalized Protocol 
   Identifier (G-PID).  

   [RFC4328] extends the Generalized Label Request, introducing two new 
   code-points for the LSP Encoding Type (i.e., G.709 ODUk (Digital Path) 
   and G.709 Optical Channel) and adding a list of G-PID values in order 
   to accommodate [G709-v1]. 

   This document follows these extensions and a new Switching Type is 
   introduced to indicate the ODUk switching capability [G709-V3] in 
   order to support backward compatibility with [RFC4328], as described 
   in [OTN-FWK]. The new Switching Type (101, TBA by IANA) is defined in 
   [OTN-OSPF]. 

   This document also updates the G-PID values defined in [RFC4328]: 

   Value    G-PID Type  

   -----    ----------        

   47       ODU-2.5G: transport of Digital Paths at 2.5, 10 and 40 Gbps 
                via 2.5Gbps TSG 

   49       CBRa: asynchronous Constant Bit Rate (i.e., mapping of 
                CBR2G5, CBR10G and CBR40G) 

   50       CBRb: bit synchronous Constant Bit Rate (i.e., mapping of 
                CBR2G5, CBR10G, CBR40G, CBR10G3 and supra-2.488 CBR 
                Gbit/s signal (carried by OPUflex)) 

   32       ATM: mapping at 1.25, 2.5, 10 and 40 Gbps 

   51       BSOT: non-specific client Bit Stream with Octet Timing (i.e., 
                Mapping of 1.25, 2.5, 10, 40 and 100 Gbps Bit Stream) 

   52       BSNT: non-specific client Bit Stream without Octet Timing 
                (i.e., Mapping of 1.25, 2.5, 10, 40 and 100 Gbps Bit 
                Stream)

   Note: Values 32, 47, 49 and 50 include mapping of SDH. 

   In the case of ODU multiplexing, the LO ODU (i.e., the client signal) 
   may be multiplexed into HO ODU via 1.25G TSG, 2.5G TSG or any one of 
   them (i.e., TSG Auto_Negotiation is enabled). Since the G-PID type 
   "ODUk" defined in [RFC4328] is only used for 2.5Gbps TSG, two new G-
   PID types are defined as follows:  

      - ODU-1.25G: transport of Digital Paths at 1.25, 2.5, 10, 40 and 
                100 Gbps via 1.25Gbps TSG 

      - ODU-any: transport of Digital Paths at 1.25, 2.5, 10, 40 and 100 
                Gbps via 1.25 or 2.5Gbps TSG (i.e., the fallback 
                procedure is enabled and the default value of 1.25Gbps 
                TSG can be fallen back to 2.5Gbps if needed) 

   In addition, some other new G-PID types are defined to support other 
   new client signals described in [G709-V3]: 

      - CBRc:   Mapping of constant bit-rate signals with justification 
                into OPUk (k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) via GMP (i.e., mapping of 
                sub-1.238, supra-1.238 to sub-2.488, close-to 9.995, 
                close-to 40.149 and close-to 104.134 Gbit/s CBR client 
                signal) 

      - 1000BASE-X: Mapping of a 1000BASE-X signal via timing 
                transparent transcoding into OPU0 

      - FC-1200: Mapping of a FC-1200 signal via timing transparent 
                transcoding into OPU2e 

   The following table summarizes the new G-PID values with respect to 
   the LSP Encoding Type: 

      Value     G-PID Type               LSP Encoding Type 
      -----     ----------               -----------------

5. Extensions for Traffic Parameters for the Evolving G.709 

   The traffic parameters for G.709 are defined as follows: 

      0                   1                   2                   3 
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

   The Signal Type MUST be extended in order to cover the new Signal 
   Type introduced by the evolving OTN. The new Signal Type values are 
   extended as follows: 

      Value    Type 
      -----    ---- 
      0        Not significant 
      1        ODU1 (i.e., 2.5 Gbps) 
      2        ODU2 (i.e., 10 Gbps) 
      3        ODU3 (i.e., 40 Gbps) 
      4        ODU4 (i.e., 100 Gbps) 
      5        Reserved (for future use) 
      6        OCh at 2.5 Gbps 
      7        OCh at 10 Gbps 
      8        OCh at 40 Gbps 
      9        OCh at 100 Gbps 
      10       ODU0 (i.e., 1.25 Gbps) 
      11       ODU2e (i.e., 10Gbps for FC1200 and GE LAN) 
      12~19    Reserved (for future use) 
      20       ODUflex(CBR) (i.e., 1.25*N Gbps) 
      21       ODUflex(GFP-F), resizable (i.e., 1.25*N Gbps) 
      22       ODUflex(GFP-F), non resizable (i.e., 1.25*N Gbps) 
      23~255   Reserved (for future use) 
    
   NMC/Tolerance:  

   This field is redefined from the original definition in [RFC4328]. 
   NMC field defined in [RFC4328] cannot be fixed value for an end-to-
   end circuit involving dissimilar OTN link types. For example, ODU2e 
   requires 9 TS on ODU3 and 8 TS on ODU4. Usage of NMC field is

   deprecated and SHOULD be used only with [RFC4328] generalized label 
   format for backwards compatibility reasons. For the new generalized 
   label format as defined in this document this field MUST be 
   interpreted as Tolerance. 

   In case of ODUflex(CBR), the Bit_Rate and Tolerance fields MUST be 
   used together to represent the actual bandwidth of ODUflex, where: 

   -  The Bit_Rate field indicates the nominal bit rate of ODUflex(CBR) 
      expressed in bytes per second, encoded as a 32-bit IEEE single-
      precision floating-point number (referring to [RFC4506] and 
      [IEEE]). The value contained in the Bit Rate field has to keep 
      into account both 239/238 factor and the Transcoding factor. 

   -  The Tolerance field indicates the bit rate tolerance (part per 
      million, ppm) of the ODUflex(CBR) encoded as an unsigned integer, 
      which is bounded in 0~100ppm. 

   For example, for an ODUflex(CBR) service with Bit_Rate = 2.5Gbps and 
   Tolerance = 100ppm, the actual bandwidth of the ODUflex is: 

                         2.5Gbps * (1 +/- 100ppm) 

   In case of ODUflex(GFP), the Bit_Rate field is used to indicate the 
   nominal bit rate of the ODUflex(GFP), which implies the number of 
   tributary slots requested for the ODUflex(GFP). Since the tolerance 
   of ODUflex(GFP) makes no sense on tributary slot resource reservation, 
   the Tolerance field for ODUflex(GFP) is not necessary and MUST be 
   filled with 0. 

   In case of other ODUk signal types, the Bit_Rate and Tolerance fields 
   are not necessary and MUST be set to 0. 

   The usage of the NVC and Multiplier (MT) fields are the same as 
   [RFC4328]. 

5.1. Usage of ODUflex(CBR) Traffic Parameters 

   In case of ODUflex(CBR), the information of Bit_Rate and Tolerance in 
   the ODUflex traffic parameters MUST be used to determine the total 
   number of tributary slots N in the HO ODUk link to be reserved. Here:  

         N = Ceiling of

   In this formula, the ODUflex(CBR) nominal bit rate is the bit rate of 
   the ODUflex(CBR) on the line side, i.e., the client signal bit rate 
   after applying the 239/238 factor (according to clause 7.3 table 7.2 
   of [G709-V3]) and the transcoding factor T (if needed) on the CBR 
   client. According to clauses 17.7.3, 17.7.4 and 17.7.5 of [G709-V3]: 

   ODUflex(CBR) nominal bit rate = CBR client bit rate * (239/238) / T 

   The ODTUk.ts nominal bit rate is the nominal bit rate of the 
   tributary slot of ODUk, as shown in Table 1 (referring to [G709-V3]).

      ODU4.ts    1.301 683 217    1.301 709 251    1.301 735 285 

      Note that: 

      Minimum bit rate of ODUTk.ts =  
         ODTUk.ts nominal bit rate * (1 - HO OPUk bit rate tolerance) 

    
      Maximum bit rate of ODTUk.ts =  
         ODTUk.ts nominal bit rate * (1 + HO OPUk bit rate tolerance) 

      Where: HO OPUk bit rate tolerance = 20ppm 

   Therefore, a node receiving a PATH message containing ODUflex(CBR)  
   nominal bit rate and tolerance can allocate precise number of 
   tributary slots and set up the cross-connection for the ODUflex 
   service.  

   Note that for different ODUk, the bit rates of the tributary slots 
   are different, and so the total number of tributary slots to be 
   reserved for the ODUflex(CBR) MAY not be the same on different HO 
   ODUk links. 

   An example is given below to illustrate the usage of ODUflex(CBR) 
   traffic parameters. 

   As shown in Figure 1, assume there is an ODUflex(CBR) service 
   requesting a bandwidth of (2.5Gbps, +/-100ppm) from node A to node C. 
   In other words, the ODUflex traffic parameters indicate that Signal

   -  On the HO ODU4 link between node A and B: 

      The maximum bit rate of the ODUflex(CBR) equals 2.5Gbps * (1 + 
      100ppm), and the minimum bit rate of the tributary slot of ODU4 
      equals 1.301 683 217Gbps, so the total number of tributary slots 
      N1 to be reserved on this link is: 

      N1 = ceiling (2.5Gbps * (1 + 100ppm) / 1.301 683 217Gbps) = 2 

   -  On the HO ODU2 link between node B and C: 

      The maximum bit rate of the ODUflex equals 2.5Gbps * (1 + 100ppm), 
      and the minimum bit rate of the tributary slot of ODU2 equals 
      1.249 384 632Gbps, so the total number of tributary slots N2 to 
      be reserved on this link is: 

      N2 = ceiling (2.5Gbps * (1 + 100ppm) / 1.249 384 632Gbps) = 3 

    

5.2. Usage of ODUflex(GFP) Traffic Parameters 

   [G709-V3-A2] recommends that the ODUflex(GFP) will fill an integral 
   number of tributary slots of the smallest HO ODUk path over which the 
   ODUflex(GFP) may be carried, as shown in Table 2.

   --------------------------------+------------------+-----------

   ODUflex(GFP) of n TS, 9<=n<=32  |   n * ODU3.ts    | +/-100 ppm 
   ODUflex(GFP) of n TS, 33<=n<=80 |   n * ODU4.ts    | +/-100 ppm 

   According to this table, the Bit_Rate field for ODUflex(GFP) MUST 
   equal to one of the 80 values listed below: 

       1 * ODU2.ts; 2 * ODU2.ts; ...; 8 * ODU2.ts; 
       9 * ODU3.ts; 10 * ODU3.ts, ...; 32 * ODU3.ts; 
       33 * ODU4.ts; 34 * ODU4.ts; ...; 80 * ODU4.ts. 

   In this way, the number of required tributary slots for the 
   ODUflex(GFP) (i.e., the value of "n" in Table 2) can be deduced from 
   the Bit_Rate field. 

    

6. Generalized Label 

   [RFC3471] has defined the Generalized Label which extends the 
   traditional label by allowing the representation of not only labels 
   which are sent in-band with associated data packets, but also labels 
   which identify time-slots, wavelengths, or space division multiplexed 
   positions. The format of the corresponding RSVP-TE Generalized Label   
   object is defined in the Section 2.3 of [RFC3473]. 

   However, for different technologies, it usually needs to use specific 
   label rather than the Generalized Label. For example, the label 
   format described in [RFC4606] could be used for SDH/SONET, the label 
   format in [RFC4328] for G.709.   

6.1. New definition of ODU Generalized Label 

   In order to be compatible with new types of ODU signal and new types 
   of tributary slot, the following new ODU label format MUST be used: 

    0                   1                   2                   3

   The ODU Generalized Label is used to indicate how the LO ODUj signal 
   is multiplexed into the HO ODUk link. Note that the LO OUDj signal 
   type is indicated by traffic parameters, while the type of HO ODUk 
   link can be figured out locally according to the identifier of the 
   selected interface carried in the IF_ID RSVP_HOP Object. 

   TPN (12 bits): indicates the Tributary Port Number (TPN) for the 
   assigned Tributary Slot(s).  

      -  In case of LO ODUj multiplexed into HO ODU1/ODU2/ODU3, only the 
         lower 6 bits of TPN field are significant and the other bits of 
         TPN MUST be set to 0. 

      -  In case of LO ODUj multiplexed into HO ODU4, only the lower 7 
         bits of TPN field are significant and the other bits of TPN 
         MUST be set to 0.  

      -  In case of ODUj mapped into OTUk (j=k), the TPN is not needed 
         and this field MUST be set to 0. 

   As per [G709-V3], The TPN is used to allow for correct demultiplexing 
   in the data plane. When an LO ODUj is multiplexed into HO ODUk 
   occupying one or more TSs, a new TPN value is configured at the two 
   ends of the HO ODUk link and is put into the related MSI byte(s) in 
   the OPUk overhead at the (traffic) ingress end of the link, so that 
   the other end of the link can learn which TS(s) is/are used by the LO 
   ODUj in the data plane. 

   According to [G709-V3], the TPN field MUST be set as according to the 
   following tables:

   Note that in the case of "Flexible", the value of TPN MAY not be 
   corresponding to the TS number as per [G709-V3].  

   Length (12 bits): indicates the number of bit of the Bit Map field, 
   i.e., the total number of TS in the HO ODUk link.  

   In case of an ODUk mapped into OTUk, there is no need to indicate 
   which tributary slots will be used, so the length field MUST be set 
   to 0. 

   Bit Map (variable): indicates which tributary slots in HO ODUk that 
   the LO ODUj will be multiplexed into. The sequence of the Bit Map is 
   consistent with the sequence of the tributary slots in HO ODUk. Each 
   bit in the bit map represents the corresponding tributary slot in HO 
   ODUk with a value of 1 or 0 indicating whether the tributary slot 
   will be used by LO ODUj or not. 

   Padded bits are added behind the Bit Map to make the whole label a 
   multiple of four bytes if necessary. Padded bit MUST be set to 0 and 
   MUST be ignored. 

   Note that the Length field in the label format MAY also be used to 
   indicate the TS type of the HO ODUk (i.e., TS granularity at 1.25Gbps 
   or 2.5Gbps) since the HO ODUk type can be known from IF_ID RSVP_HOP 
   Object. In some cases when there is no LMP (Link Management Protocol)

   or routing to make the two end points of the link to know the TSG, 
   the TSG information used by another end can be deduced from the label 
   format. For example, for HO ODU2 link, the value of the length filed 
   will be 4 or 8, which indicates the TS granularity is 2.5Gbps or 
   1.25Gbps, respectively. 

6.2. Examples  

   The following examples are given in order to illustrate the label 
   format described in the previous sections of this document. 

   (1) ODUk into OTUk mapping:  

   In such conditions, the downstream node along an LSP returns a label 
   indicating that the ODUk (k=1, 2, 3, 4) is directly mapped into the 
   corresponding OTUk. The following example label indicates an ODU1 
   mapped into OTU1.

   (2) ODUj into ODUk multiplexing:  

   In such conditions, this label indicates that an ODUj is multiplexed 
   into several tributary slots of OPUk and then mapped into OTUk. Some 
   instances are shown as follow:

   the type of the tributary slot is 2.5Gbps), and the TPN value is 1. 

6.3. Label Distribution Procedure 

   This document does not change the existing label distribution 
   procedures [RFC4328] for GMPLS except that the new ODUk label MUST be 
   processed as follows. 

   When a node receives a generalized label request for setting up an 
   ODUj LSP from its upstream neighbor node, the node MUST generate an 
   ODU label according to the signal type of the requested LSP and the 
   free resources (i.e., free tributary slots of ODUk) that will be 
   reserved for the LSP, and send the label to its upstream neighbor 
   node.  

   In case of ODUj to ODUk multiplexing, the node MUST firstly determine 
   the size of the Bit Map field according to the signal type and the 
   tributary slot type of ODUk, and then set the bits to 1 in the Bit 
   Map field corresponding to the reserved tributary slots. The node 
   MUST also assign a valid TPN, which MUST not collide with other TPN 
   value used by existing LO ODU connections in the selected HO ODU link, 
   and configure the expected multiplex structure identifier (ExMSI) 
   using this TPN. Then, the assigned TPN MUST be filled into the label.

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-signaling-g709v3-04.txt               August 2012 


   In case of ODUk to OTUk mapping,  TPN field MUST be set to 0. Bit Map 
   information is not REQUIRED and MUST not be included, so Length field 
   MUST be set to 0 as well.  

   In order to process a received ODU label, the node MUST firstly learn 
   which ODU signal type is multiplexed or mapped into which ODU signal 
   type accordingly to the traffic parameters and the IF_ID RSVP_HOP 
   Object in the received message.  

   In case of ODUj to ODUk multiplexing, the node MUST retrieve the 
   reserved tributary slots in the ODUk by its downstream neighbor node 
   according to the position of the bits that are set to 1 in the Bit 
   Map field. The node determines the TS type (according to the total TS 
   number of the ODUk, or pre-configured TS type), so that the node, 
   based on the TS type, can multiplex the ODUj into the ODUk. The node 
   MUST also retrieve the TPN value assigned by its downstream neighbor 
   node from the label, and fill the TPN into the related MSI byte(s) in 
   the OPUk overhead in the data plane, so that the downstream neighbor 
   node can check whether the TPN received from the data plane is 
   consistent with the ExMSI and determine whether there is any mismatch 
   defect. 

   In case of ODUk to OTUk mapping, the size of Bit Map field MUST be 0 
   and no additional procedure is needed. 

   Note that the procedures of other label related objects (e.g., 
   Upstream Label, Label Set) are similar to the one described above. 

   Note also that the TPN in the label_ERO MAY not be assigned (i.e., 
   TPN field = 0) if the TPN is requested to be assigned locally.  

6.3.1. Notification on Label Error 

   When receiving an ODUk label from the neighbor node, the node SHOULD 
   check the integrity of the label. An error message containing an 
   "Unacceptable label value" indication ([RFC3209]) SHOULD be sent if 
   one of the following cases occurs: 

   -  Invalid value in the length field. 

   -  The selected link only supports 2.5Gbps TS granularity while the 
      Length field in the label along with ODUk signal type indicates 
      the 1.25Gbps TS granularity; 

   -  The label includes an invalid TPN value that breaks the TPN 
      assignment rules;

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-signaling-g709v3-04.txt               August 2012 


   -  The reserved resources (i.e., the number of "1" in the Bit Map 
      field) do not match with the Traffic Parameters. 

6.4. Supporting Virtual Concatenation and Multiplication 

   As per [RFC6344], the VCGs can be created using Co-Signaled style or 
   Multiple LSPs style. 

   In case of Co-Signaled style, the explicit ordered list of all labels 
   reflects the order of VCG members, which is similar to [RFC4328]. In 
   case of multiplexed virtually concatenated signals (NVC > 1), the 
   first label indicates the components of the first virtually 
   concatenated signal; the second label indicates the components of the 
   second virtually concatenated signal; and so on. In case of 
   multiplication of multiplexed virtually concatenated signals (MT > 1), 
   the first label indicates the components of the first multiplexed 
   virtually concatenated signal; the second label indicates components 
   of the second multiplexed virtually concatenated signal; and so on. 

   In case of Multiple LSPs style, multiple control plane LSPs are 
   created with a single VCG and the VCAT Call can be used to associate 
   the control plane LSPs. The procedures are similar to section 6 of 
   [RFC6344]. 

    

7. Supporting Hitless Adjustment of ODUflex (GFP) 

   [G.7044] describes the procedure of ODUflex (GFP) hitless resizing 
   using LCR (Link Connection Resize) and BWR (Bandwidth Resize) 
   protocols in OTN data plane. 

   For the control plane, signaling messages are REQUIRED to initiate 
   the adjustment procedure. Section 2.5 and Section 4.6.4 of [RFC3209] 
   describe how the Share Explicit (SE) style is used in TE network for 
   bandwidth increasing and decreasing, which SHOULD be still applicable 
   for triggering the ODUflex (GFP) adjustment procedure in data plane.  

   Note that the SE style SHOULD be used at the beginning when creating 
   a resizable ODUflex connection (Signal Type = 21). Otherwise an error 
   with Error Code "Conflicting reservation style" SHOULD be generated 
   when performing bandwidth adjustment. 

   -  Bandwidth increasing 

       In order to increase the bandwidth of an ODUflex (GFP) connection, 
       a Path message with SE style (keeping Tunnel ID unchanged and 
 
 
Zhang                  Expires February 2013                   [Page 17] 

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-signaling-g709v3-04.txt               August 2012 


       assigning a new LSP ID) is sent along the path. 

       A downstream node compares the old Traffic Parameters (stored 
       locally) with the new one carried in the Path message, to 
       determine the number of TS to be added. After choosing and 
       reserving new free TS, the downstream node sends back a Resv 
       message carrying both the old and new LABEL Objects in the SE 
       flow descriptor, so that its upstream neighbor can determine 
       which TS are added. And the LCR protocol between each pair of 
       neighbor nodes is triggered. 

       On the source node, the BWR protocol will be triggered by the 
       successful completion of LCR protocols on every hop after Resv 
       message is processed. On success of BWR, the source node SHOULD 
       send a PathTear message to delete the old control state (i.e., 
       the control state of the ODUflex (GFP) before resizing) on the 
       control plane. 

   -  Bandwidth decreasing 

       The SE style SHOULD also be used for ODUflex bandwidth decreasing. 
       For each pair of neighbor nodes, the sending and receiving Resv 
       message with old and new LABEL Objects will trigger the first 
       step of LCR between them to perform LCR handshake. On the source 
       node, the BWR protocol will be triggered by the successful 
       completion of LCR handshake on every hop after Resv message is 
       processed. On success of BWR, the second step of LCR, i.e., link 
       connection decrease procedure will be started on every hop of the 
       connection. 

       Similarly, after completion of bandwidth decreasing, a ResvErr 
       message SHOULD be sent to tear down the old control state. 

        

8. Control Plane Backward Compatibility Considerations 

   As described in [OTN-FWK], since the [RFC4328] has been deployed in 
   the network for the nodes that support [G709-V1], control plane 
   backward compatibility SHOULD be taken into consideration. More 
   specifically: 

   o  Nodes supporting this document SHOULD support [OTN-OSPF]. 

   o  Nodes supporting this document MAY support [RFC4328] signaling. 


 
 
Zhang                  Expires February 2013                   [Page 18] 

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-signaling-g709v3-04.txt               August 2012 


   o  A node supporting both sets of procedures (i.e., [RFC4328] and 
      this document) is NOT REQUIRED to signal an LSP using both 
      procedures, i.e., to act as a signaling version translator. 

   o  Ingress nodes that support both sets of procedures MAY select 
      which set of procedures to follow based on routing information or 
      local policy. 

   o  Per [RFC3473], nodes that do not support this document will 
      generate a PathErr message, with a "Routing problem/Switching 
      Type" indication. 

    

9. Security Considerations 

   This document introduces no new security considerations to the 
   existing GMPLS signaling protocols. Referring to [RFC3473], further 
   details of the specific security measures are provided. Additionally, 
   [GMPLS-SEC] provides an overview of security vulnerabilities and 
   protection mechanisms for the GMPLS control plane. 

    

10. IANA Considerations 

   -  G.709 SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC objects: 

       The traffic parameters, which are carried in the G.709 
       SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC objects, do not require any new object 
       class and type based on [RFC4328]: 

       o  G.709 SENDER_TSPEC Object: Class = 12, C-Type = 5 [RFC4328] 

       o  G.709 FLOWSPEC Object: Class = 9, C-Type = 5 [RFC4328] 

   -  Generalized Label Object: 

       The new defined ODU label (Section 6) is a kind of generalized 
       label. Therefore, the Class-Num and C-Type of the ODU label is 
       the same as that of generalized label described in [RFC3473], 
       i.e., Class-Num = 16, C-Type = 2.
