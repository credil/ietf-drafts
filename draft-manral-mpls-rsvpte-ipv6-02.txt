Abstract

   RSVP defined in [RFC2205] defines a resource reservation setup
   protocol, designed for an integrated service internet.

   RSVP-TE defined in [RFC2205] extends RSVP to establish LSP's in MPLS.
   For RSVP-TE hops that cannot allocate Labels cannot exist in the PATH
   of the LSP's.  It is therefore specified that for IPv6 RSVP-TE LSP's
   Path, PathTear and ResvConf Messages should address the messages
   directly to an adjacent node control plane IPv6 address.

   This document also specfies some other changes required for RSVP-TE
   to work over IPv6 transport.

Internet-Draft            RSVP-TE IPv6 Changes                March 2012


1.  Introduction

   RSVP was designed to allow non RSVP nodes along the PATH to exist.
   The restriction does not apply for RSVP-TE for IPv6 as a node that
   cannot allocate Labels cannot exist in the PATH of the LSP's.
   RSVP-TE for IPv6 has not been widely deployed.  It is there fore
   reccomended that RSVP-TE signalling over IPv6 not use Router Alert
   Option but instead send packet to the Peer control plane address.

   Some other details missed out in IPv6 are also explained in detail


2.  Router Alert Option Details

   RSVP itself does not specify anything about the Router Alert Option
   in IPv6, though it explicitly specifies the details of the Router
   Alert Option for IPv4.  It however specifies extensions for all the
   objects for IPv6.

   Assuming the Path, PathTear or ResvConf Message use Router Alert in
   IPv6 extension in the IPv6 just like in IPv4, the IPv6 Hop-by-Hop
   options header is extended for allowing the Router Alert
   Functionality [RFC2711].

   Besides the known security risks related to DoS atttacks with Router
   Alert in operational networks, the option is also not well
   implemented in the field in most OS's.  It is there fore reccomended
   that Path, PathTear or ResvConf messages when transported over IPv6
   SHOULD send the packets directly to the neighbor control plane IPv6
   address.


3.  Other minor changes

   Hello Messages need to be sent out with the Hop Limit Field set to 1
   for IPv6 based Hellos.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document precludes the use of the Router Alert Option, which is
   related to possible security risks related to DoS attacks.  This
   draft thus improves the security of the IPv6 based RSVP-TE.

   This draft clarifies the behavior of RSVP-TE for IPv6 which can lead
   to better implementations and hence lesser security and other issues.
