Internet-Draft     Link Type Registrations for OAuth 2      October 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document defines the link type [RFC5988] registrations for the
   OAuth 2 [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2] authentication framework and for OAuth
   1.0a [RFC5849].  These link types are used during the endpoint
   discovery process using Web Host Metadata [RFC6415] and Webfinger
   [I-D.ietf-appsawg-webfinger] by clients needing to discover the
   authorization, token, and initiation endpoints for a service or site.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terms used in the OAuth
   2 and OAuth 1.0a specifcations.

3.  OAuth 2 Link Types

   OAuth 2 [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2] defines two endpoints which a site or
   domain might need to advertize via a mechanism such as Webfinger
   [I-D.ietf-appsawg-webfinger].  These are the user authorization
   endpoint (usually expected to be a web page the user interacts with)
   and the token endpoint used for obtaining tokens used to access
   protected resources.  These are described in detail in the OAuth 2
   specification.

3.1.  OAuth 2 Authorization Endpoint

   This link type indicates an OAuth 2 authorization endpoint to be used
   for user authentication/authorization to grant access to a protected
   resource.

3.2.  OAuth 2 Token Endpoint

   The OAuth 2 token endpoint to be used for obtaining tokens to access
   protected services.  This link type has two link-extensions:



      grant-types:  A space separated list of OAuth 2 grant types (see
         section 4 of [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2]) that can be used at the token
         endpoint to obtain a token.  This is not an exclusive list, it
         provides a hint to the application of what SHOULD be valid.  A
         token endpoint MAY support additional grant types not
         advertised by a discovery service.  The client MAY use this to
         determine the grant types available for use.

      token-types:  A space separated list of OAuth 2 token types (see
         section 7.1 of [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2]) that may be issued by the
         token endpoint.  It is possible for a token endpoint to issue
         multiple tokens, and types may vary based on scope or other
         factors.  This is not an exclusive list, it provides a hint to
         the application of what SHOULD be valid, and it MAY be used by
         a client to determine if the client supports one or more of the
         token type(s) available.

4.  OAuth 1.0a Link Types

   The OAuth 1.0a [RFC5849] protocol defines three endpoints that a site
   supporting OAuth 1.0a might advertize via a mechanism like Webfinger:
   the request initiation endpoint, the authorization endpoint, and the
   token endpoint.  These are descibed in detail in the OAuth 1.0a
   specification.

4.1.  OAuth 1.0a Request Initiation Endpoint

   The OAuth 1.0a endpoint used to initiate the sequence, this short
   lived request is what the user approves to grant access to the
   resource.

4.2.  OAuth 1.0a Authorization Endpoint

   The OAuth 1.0a authorization endpoint used to approve an access
   request.  This is expected to be a user facing web interface.

4.3.  OAuth 1.0a Token Endpoint

   The OAuth 1.0a token API endpoint used to exchange an approved access
   request for a token, used by the client once the resource owner has
   approved the access request.

   registries, and as such has no security properties to discuss.
