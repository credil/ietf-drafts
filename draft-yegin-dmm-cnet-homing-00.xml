    <abstract>
      <t>Mobile IP protocols provide IP session continuity to Mobile Nodes at the expense of creating triangular routes via a centralized Home Agent. Increased latency and network resource use, introduction of a single point of failure and a network choke point are among the undesirable side effects of the current protocols. This document describes an alternative approach where the Mobile Node makes use of dynamically-assigned Home Agent that is located close to the Corresponding Node. </t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

    <t>In the context of Mobile IP <xref target="RFC5563"></xref><xref
      target="RFC6275"></xref><xref
      target="RFC5213"></xref><xref
      target="RFC5944"></xref>
      following two attributes are defined for the IP service provided to the mobile hosts:</t>

      <t>IP session continuity: The ability to maintain an ongoing IP session by keeping the same local end-point IP address throughout the session despite moving among different IP networks. The IP address of the host may change between two independent IP sessions, but that does not jeopardize the IP session continuity. IP session continuity is essential for mobile hosts to maintain ongoing IP sessions without any interruption.</t>

      <t>IP address reachability: The ability to maintain the same IP address for an extended period of time. The IP address shall stay the same across independent IP sessions, and even in the absence of any IP session. The IP address may be published in a long-term registry (e.g., DNS), and it shall be available for serving incoming connections. IP address reachability is essential for mobile hosts to use specific/published IP addresses.</t> 

      <t>Mobile IP is designed to provide both IP session continuity and IP address reachability to mobile hosts.  The basic operation of Mobile IP involves the following: Network assigning a fixed IP address to the Mobile Node (the Home Address, HoA) from a fixed node (the Home Agent, HA), the HA receiving location updates from the Mobile Node (MN), and the HA intercepting IP packets on behalf of the MN and tunneling them to the MN. That way the MN ensures it can keep receiving IP packets irrespective of its movement and location in the network.</t> 

      <t>One obvious side effect of this approach is the creation of sub-optimal routing paths between the MN and the other nodes it is communicating with (the Corresponding Nodes, CN). The routing path between the MN and a CN has to traverse the HA. Unless the HA is already located on the path between the MN and the CN, the path traversing the HA would create a so-called triangular route which is longer than the direct path between the two end-points. Longer path yields additional transmission latency and use of network resources <xref target="I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Furthermore, forcing all MN traffic via the HA would also create a bottleneck in the network by overloading a single network element. The cost of building and operating such a network would increase, whereas the overall network reliability would decrease <xref target="I-D.ietf-dmm-requirements"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The objective of the solution described in this document is to provide IP session continuity to MNs without creating the aforementioned side effects.</t> 

      <t>The solution does not cover support for IP address reachability. This is considered to be acceptable, because only a very small set of applications really need IP address reachability. Those are the applications that are running as servers. Such applications cannot avoid using standard Mobile IP since they need to accept incoming connections at a specific/published IP address.</t>

    <section anchor="solution" title="Solution in a Nutshell">
      
    
    <t>The negative side effects of Mobile IP can be remedied if the HA were positioned on the direct path between the MN and the CN. That way the IP packets would naturally flow thru the HA and not follow a triangular route. But, this is not possible when a single/fixed IP address is assigned to the MN and it is served by a single HA at a fixed location <xref target="RFC5563"></xref><xref
      target="RFC6275"></xref><xref
      target="RFC5213"></xref><xref
      target="RFC5944"></xref> while the MN is communicating with CNs that are located in multiple different locations in the Internet.</t>

    <t> The solution proposed in this document utilizes HAs located near CNs (Corresponding Home Agent, CHA) to dynamically allocate a HoA to the MN (Corresponding Home Address, CHoA). Such an address will be used throughout the IP session between the MN and the CN. Given the topological proximity of the CHA to the direct path between the MN and the CN, it is expected that this solution would not have the negative side effects of providing IP session continuity.</t>

    <t>CHA may be co-located with the CN, or located in the same site as the CN, or located in an ISP serving that site. Not all CNs may be served by a CHA. In case there is no CHA serving the CN, the MN and the CN may communicate using the HoA via the HA. It is expected that CHAs would be deployed for dominant content sites on the Internet (e.g., YouTube, Facebook, Netflix, etc.)</t>

    <t>The MN may be using multiple applications at the same time, and each application may be using a different CHA. For example, the MN may be configured to use CHoA1 for App1 with CN1 via CHA1, and use CHoA2 for App2  with CN2 via CHA2 at the same time. </t>

        <t>Assume the MN is already configured with an IP address allocated from the access network it is attached to. Let this IP address be called IPxs.</t> 

        <t>Step 1:</t> 

        <t>Application on the MN attempts to initiate communication with the CN.</t>

	<t>Step 2:</t> 
	
	<t>Network stack on the MN resolves the CN hostname to the IP address of CN. In parallel with that, the stack also tries to resolve the cha.CN_hostname in order to discover the CHA serving the CN, if there is any.</t>

	<t>Step 3:</t>
	
	<t>If a CHA is discovered at Step 2, then the network stack sends a Binding Update to the CHA. The HoA in the Binding Update is set to unspecified IP address (0.0.0.0/::) in order to request a dynamically-allocated CHoA from the CHA.</t>
	
	<t>Step 4:</t>
	
	<t>A tunnel is setup between the MN and the CHA as a result of Step 3. The tunnel end-points are IPxs and IP address of CHA (IPcha).</t>
	
	<t>Step 5:</t>
	
	<t>The socket used by the application is bound to the CHoA. The end-to-end communication between the App and the CN uses CHoA and IP address of CN (IPcn). Those IP packets are tunneled between the MN and the CHA.</t>

	<t>Step 1: </t>
	
	<t>Application attempts to resolve the IP address of the CN by issuing a Socket API call (e.g., gethostbyname, getaddrinfo).</t>
	
	<t>Step 2a: </t>

	<t>Step 2b:</t>
	
	<t> In parallel with Step 2a, DNS client on the MN should also send a DNS request to the DNS server in order to resolve the IP address of cha.CN_hostname. </t> 
	
	<t>Steps 3a and 3b:</t>
	
	<t> DNS server returns the results.</t>
	
	<t>Step 4:</t>
	
	<t>At some point, the application attempts to send its first packet to the CN by issuing a Socket API call (e.g., connect, sendto).</t>
	
	<t>Step 5:</t>
	
	<t>If Step 3b has produced an IP address for the CHA (which indicates availability of a CHA for the CN), then the MN shall send a Binding Update to the CHA. The Binding Update shall include a HoA that is set to the unspecified IP address (0.0.0.0 for IPv4, :: for IPv6).</t> 
	
	<t>Steps 6 and 7: </t>
	
	<t>The CHA may need to authenticate the incoming Binding Update in order to authorize it. This step may require AAA <xref

      target="RFC3588"></xref> between the CHA and a AAA server.</t>
	
	<t>Step 8:</t>
	
	<t>The CHA shall return a Binding Acknowledgement to the MN. This message should contain a dynamically-allocated HoA. This HoA is regarded as a CHoA.</t>
	
	<t>Step 9:</t> 
	
	<t>The MN shall configure the received CHoA on its stack. The MN and the CHA shall also setup a tunnel between the care-of address in the Binding Update (the IPxs) and IPcha. The MN shall setup a routing table entry to forward any IP packet whose source address is CHoA to the CHA via the tunnel. The CHA shall setup a routing table entry to forward any IP packet whose destination address is CHoA to the MN via the tunnel.</t>
	
	<t>Step 10:</t>
	
	<t>The MN shall assign the newly-configured CHoA as the source address for the socket used by the application. If a connection-oriented transport protocol is used, then a connection shall be established between (e.g., via TCP 3-way handshake) the CHoA and the IPcn (as obtained in Step 3a) via the tunnel between the MN and the CHA.</t> 
	
	<t>Step 11:</t> 
	
	<t>The communication between the application and the CN shall use CHoA and the IPcn as the end-points, and go via the tunnel between the MN and the CHA.</t>

	<t>Step 1:</t>
	
	<t>The MN configures a new IP address from the new access network (IPxs2).</t>
	
	<t>Step 2:</t>
	
	<t>When the IP address of the MN changes, the MN shall send a Binding Update to the CHA for informing the CHA about this change and binding the CHoA to the new IP address. The Binding Update shall include a CoA set to the IPxs2 and the HoA set to the CHoA.</t>
	
	<t>Step 3:</t> 
	
	<t>The CHA shall process the incoming Binding Update according to <xref
      target="RFC6275"></xref><xref
      target="RFC5944"></xref> and return a Binding Acknowledgement.</t> 
	
	<t>Step 4:</t>
	
	<t>The MN and the CHA shall setup a new tunnel with each other upon successful execution of Steps 3 and 4. The tunnel end-points shall be set to IPxs2 and IPcha. The CHA shall forward any incoming packet whose destination is CHoA towards the MN via the tunnel. The MN shall forward any outgoing packet whose source address is CHoA towards the CN via the tunnel.</t>

	<t>Step 1:</t>
	
	<t>The application attempts to close the session with the CN.</t> 
	
	<t>Step 2:</t>
	
	<t>The MN shall close the connection with the CN, if a connection-oriented transport is used (e.g., TCP, SCTP).</t>  
	
	<t>Step 3:</t>
	
	<t>The MN shall send a Binding Update to CHA with lifetime set to 0.</t> 
	
	<t>Step 4:</t>
	
	<t>The CHA shall send a Binding Acknowledgement back to the MN. The CHA and the MN shall release the tunnel, remove the forwarding entries for the CHoA. The CHA shall return the CHoA to the pool of available IP addresses. The MN shall unconfigure the CHoA on its stack.</t> 
	
	<t>If a connectionless protocol is used (e.g., UDP) between the MN and the CN, then the tear down may be triggered based on an inactivity timer or other indications.</t>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
   <t>If the Binding Update message is not origin authenticated, then it may be leveraged for a DoS attack depleting the CHoA pool on the CHA.</t> 

   <t>This threat may be mitigated by allocating the CHoA from a very large address pool, such as 10.0.0.0/8 for IPv4, or a /64 prefix for IPv6. Depleting such a large address pool requires a significant brute-force attack. At that point the type of attack and its mitigations change and fall outside the scope of this document.</t>

   <t>Another mitigation is to use origin authentication, replay and integrity protection on the Mobile IP messages <xref target="RFC6275"></xref><xref target="RFC5944"></xref><xref target="RFC4285"></xref> . </t>
