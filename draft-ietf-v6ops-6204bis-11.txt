Internet-Draft         IPv6 CE Router Requirements        September 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document defines basic IPv6 features for a residential or small-
   office router, referred to as an IPv6 CE router.  Typically, these
   routers also support IPv4.

   Mixed environments of dual-stack hosts and IPv6-only hosts (behind
   the CE router) can be more complex if the IPv6-only devices are using
   a translator to access IPv4 servers [RFC6144].  Support for such
   mixed environments is not in scope of this document.

   This document specifies how an IPv6 CE router automatically
   provisions its WAN interface, acquires address space for provisioning
   of its LAN interfaces, and fetches other configuration information
   from the service provider network.  Automatic provisioning of more
   complex topology than a single router with multiple LAN interfaces is
   out of scope for this document.

   See [RFC4779] for a discussion of options available for deploying
   IPv6 in service provider access networks.

   The document also covers the IP transition technologies that were
   available at the time this document was written.  Two transition
   technologies in 6rd [RFC5969] and DS-Lite [RFC6333] are covered in
   the document.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Even though this document has Informational status, it specifies
   requirements using RFC 2119 language, but not strictly for the
   purpose of interoperability.  Some requirements are intentionally
   specified for the purpose of establishing industry-common baseline
   functionality.  As such, the document points to several other
   specifications (preferable in RFC or stable form) to provide
   additional guidance to implementers regarding any protocol
   implementation required to produce a successful CPE router that
   interoperates successfully with a particular subset of currently
   deploying and planned common IPv6 access networks.

   End-User Network          one or more links attached to the IPv6 CE
                             router that connect IPv6 hosts.

   IPv6 Customer Edge Router a node intended for home or small-office
                             use that forwards IPv6 packets not
                             explicitly addressed to itself.  The IPv6
                             CE router connects the end-user network to
                             a service provider network.

   IPv6 Host                 any device implementing an IPv6 stack
                             receiving IPv6 connectivity through the
                             IPv6 CE router.

   LAN Interface             an IPv6 CE router's attachment to a link in
                             the end-user network.  Examples are
                             Ethernet (simple or bridged), 802.11
                             wireless, or other LAN technologies.  An
                             IPv6 CE router may have one or more
                             network-layer LAN interfaces.

   Service Provider          an entity that provides access to the
                             Internet.  In this document, a service
                             provider specifically offers Internet
                             access using IPv6, and may also offer IPv4
                             Internet access.  The service provider can
                             provide such access over a variety of
                             different transport methods such as DSL,
                             cable, wireless, and others.

   WAN Interface             an IPv6 CE router's attachment to a link
                             used to provide connectivity to the service
                             provider network; example link technologies
                             include Ethernet (simple or bridged), PPP
                             links, Frame Relay, or ATM networks, as
                             well as Internet-layer (or higher-layer)
                             "tunnels", such as tunnels over IPv4 or
                             IPv6 itself.


3.  Architecture

3.1.  Current IPv4 End-User Network Architecture

   An end-user network will likely support both IPv4 and IPv6.  It is
   not expected that an end-user will change their existing network
   topology with the introduction of IPv6.  There are some differences
   in how IPv6 works and is provisioned; these differences have
   implications for the network architecture.  A typical IPv4 end-user

   network consists of a "plug and play" router with NAT functionality
   and a single link behind it, connected to the service provider
   network.

   A typical IPv4 NAT deployment by default blocks all incoming
   connections.  Opening of ports is typically allowed using a Universal
   Plug and Play Internet Gateway Device (UPnP IGD) [UPnP-IGD] or some
   other firewall control protocol.

   Another consequence of using private address space in the end-user
   network is that it provides stable addressing; i.e., it never changes
   even when you change service providers, and the addresses are always
   there even when the WAN interface is down or the customer edge router
   has not yet been provisioned.

   Many existing routers support dynamic routing (which learns routes
   from other routers), and advanced end-users can build arbitrary,
   complex networks using manual configuration of address prefixes
   combined with a dynamic routing protocol.

3.2.  IPv6 End-User Network Architecture

   The end-user network architecture for IPv6 should provide equivalent
   or better capabilities and functionality than the current IPv4
   architecture.

   The end-user network is a stub network.  Figure 1 illustrates the
   model topology for the end-user network.

   This architecture describes the:

   o  Basic capabilities of an IPv6 CE router

   o  Provisioning of the WAN interface connecting to the service
      provider

   o  Provisioning of the LAN interfaces

   For IPv6 multicast traffic, the IPv6 CE router may act as a Multicast
   Listener Discovery (MLD) proxy [RFC4605] and may support a dynamic
   multicast routing protocol.

   The IPv6 CE router may be manually configured in an arbitrary
   topology with a dynamic routing protocol.  Automatic provisioning and
   configuration are described for a single IPv6 CE router only.

3.2.1.  Local Communication

   Link-local IPv6 addresses are used by hosts communicating on a single
   link.  Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses (ULAs) [RFC4193] are used
   by hosts communicating within the end-user network across multiple
   links, but without requiring the application to use a globally
   routable address.  The IPv6 CE router defaults to acting as the

Internet-Draft         IPv6 CE Router Requirements        September 2012


   demarcation point between two networks by providing a ULA boundary, a
   multicast zone boundary, and ingress and egress traffic filters.

   At the time of this writing, several host implementations do not
   handle the case where they have an IPv6 address configured and no
   IPv6 connectivity, either because the address itself has a limited
   topological reachability (e.g., ULA) or because the IPv6 CE router is
   not connected to the IPv6 network on its WAN interface.  To support
   host implementations that do not handle multihoming in a multi-prefix
   environment [MULTIHOMING-WITHOUT-NAT], the IPv6 CE router should not,
   as detailed in the requirements below, advertise itself as a default
   router on the LAN interface(s) when it does not have IPv6
   connectivity on the WAN interface or when it is not provisioned with
   IPv6 addresses.  For local IPv6 communication, the mechanisms
   specified in [RFC4191] are used.

   ULA addressing is useful where the IPv6 CE router has multiple LAN
   interfaces with hosts that need to communicate with each other.  If
   the IPv6 CE router has only a single LAN interface (IPv6 link), then
   link-local addressing can be used instead.

   Coexistence with IPv4 requires any IPv6 CE router(s) on the LAN to
   conform to these recommendations, especially requirements ULA-5 and
   L-4 below.


4.  Requirements

4.1.  General Requirements

   The IPv6 CE router is responsible for implementing IPv6 routing; that
   is, the IPv6 CE router must look up the IPv6 destination address in
   its routing table to decide to which interface it should send the
   packet.

   In this role, the IPv6 CE router is responsible for ensuring that
   traffic using its ULA addressing does not go out the WAN interface,
   and does not originate from the WAN interface.

   G-1:  An IPv6 CE router is an IPv6 node according to the IPv6 Node
         Requirements [RFC6434] specification.

   G-2:  The IPv6 CE router MUST implement ICMPv6 according to
         [RFC4443].  In particular, point-to-point links MUST be handled
         as described in Section 3.1 of [RFC4443].

Internet-Draft         IPv6 CE Router Requirements        September 2012


   G-3:  The IPv6 CE router MUST NOT forward any IPv6 traffic between
         its LAN interface(s) and its WAN interface until the router has
         successfully completed the IPv6 address and the delegated
         prefix acquisition process.

   G-4:  By default, an IPv6 CE router that has no default router(s) on
         its WAN interface MUST NOT advertise itself as an IPv6 default
         router on its LAN interfaces.  That is, the "Router Lifetime"
         field is set to zero in all Router Advertisement messages it
         originates [RFC4861].

   G-5:  By default, if the IPv6 CE router is an advertising router and
         loses its IPv6 default router(s) and/or detects loss of
         connectivity on the WAN interface, it MUST explicitly
         invalidate itself as an IPv6 default router on each of its
         advertising interfaces by immediately transmitting one or more
         Router Advertisement messages with the "Router Lifetime" field
         set to zero [RFC4861].

4.2.  WAN-Side Configuration

   The IPv6 CE router will need to support connectivity to one or more
   access network architectures.  This document describes an IPv6 CE
   router that is not specific to any particular architecture or service
   provider and that supports all commonly used architectures.

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery and DHCPv6 protocols operate over any type of
   IPv6-supported link layer, and there is no need for a link-layer-
   specific configuration protocol for IPv6 network-layer configuration
   options as in, e.g., PPP IP Control Protocol (IPCP) for IPv4.  This
   section makes the assumption that the same mechanism will work for
   any link layer, be it Ethernet, the Data Over Cable Service Interface
   Specification (DOCSIS), PPP, or others.

   WAN-side requirements:

   W-1:  When the router is attached to the WAN interface link, it MUST
         act as an IPv6 host for the purposes of stateless [RFC4862] or
         stateful [RFC3315] interface address assignment.

   W-2:  The IPv6 CE router MUST generate a link-local address and
         finish Duplicate Address Detection according to [RFC4862] prior
         to sending any Router Solicitations on the interface.  The
         source address used in the subsequent Router Solicitation MUST
         be the link-local address on the WAN interface.

Internet-Draft         IPv6 CE Router Requirements        September 2012


   W-3:  Absent other routing information, the IPv6 CE router MUST use
         Router Discovery as specified in [RFC4861] to discover a
         default router(s) and install default route(s) in its routing
         table with the discovered router's address as the next hop.

   W-4:  The router MUST act as a requesting router for the purposes of
         DHCPv6 prefix delegation ([RFC3633]).

   W-5:  The IPv6 CE router MUST use a persistent DHCP Unique Identifier
         (DUID) for DHCPv6 messages.  The DUID MUST NOT change between
         network interface resets or IPv6 CE router reboots.

   W-6:  The WAN interface of the CE router SHOULD support a PCP client
         as specified in [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] for use by applications on
         the CE Router.  The PCP client SHOULD follow the procedure
         specified in Section 8.1 of [I-D.ietf-pcp-base] to discover its
         PCP server.  This document takes no position on whether such
         functionality is enabled by default or mechanisms by which
         users would configure the functionality.  Handling PCP requests
         from PCP clients in the LAN side of the CE Router is out of
         scope.

   Link-layer requirements:

   WLL-1:  If the WAN interface supports Ethernet encapsulation, then
           the IPv6 CE router MUST support IPv6 over Ethernet [RFC2464].

   WLL-2:  If the WAN interface supports PPP encapsulation, the IPv6 CE
           router MUST support IPv6 over PPP [RFC5072].

   WLL-3:  If the WAN interface supports PPP encapsulation, in a dual-
           stack environment with IPCP and IPV6CP running over one PPP
           logical channel, the Network Control Protocols (NCPs) MUST be
           treated as independent of each other and start and terminate
           independently.

   Address assignment requirements:

   WAA-1:   The IPv6 CE router MUST support Stateless Address
            Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [RFC4862].

   WAA-2:   The IPv6 CE router MUST follow the recommendations in
            Section 4 of [RFC5942], and in particular the handling of
            the L flag in the Router Advertisement Prefix Information
            option.

   WAA-3:   The IPv6 CE router MUST support DHCPv6 [RFC3315] client
            behavior.

   WAA-4:   The IPv6 CE router MUST be able to support the following
            DHCPv6 options: IA_NA, Reconfigure Accept [RFC3315], and
            DNS_SERVERS [RFC3646].  The IPv6 CE router SHOULD be able to
            support the DNS Search List DNSSL option as specified in
            [RFC3646].

   WAA-5:   The IPv6 CE router SHOULD implement the Network Time
            Protocol (NTP) as specified in [RFC5905] to provide a time
            reference common to the service provider for other
            protocols, such as DHCPv6, to use.  If the CE router
            implements NTP, it requests the NTP Server DHCPv6 option
            [RFC5908] and uses the received list of servers as primary
            time reference, unless explicitly configured otherwise.  LAN
            side support of NTP is out of scope for this document.

   WAA-6:   If the IPv6 CE router receives a Router Advertisement
            message (described in [RFC4861]) with the M flag set to 1,
            the IPv6 CE router MUST do DHCPv6 address assignment
            (request an IA_NA option).

   WAA-7:   If the IPv6 CE router does not acquire global IPv6
            address(es) from either SLAAC or DHCPv6, then it MUST create
            global IPv6 address(es) from its delegated prefix(es) and
            configure those on one of its internal virtual network
            interfaces, unless configured to require a global IPv6
            address on the WAN interface.

   WAA-8:   The CE router must support the SOL_MAX_RT option
            [I-D.droms-dhc-dhcpv6-solmaxrt-update] and request the
            SOL_MAX_RT option in an ORO.

   WAA-9:   As a router, the IPv6 CE router MUST follow the weak host
            (Weak ES) model [RFC1122].  When originating packets from an
            interface, it will use a source address from another one of
            its interfaces if the outgoing interface does not have an
            address of suitable scope.

   WAA-10:  The IPv6 CE router SHOULD implement the Information Refresh
            Time option and associated client behavior as specified in
            [RFC4242].

   Prefix delegation requirements:

Internet-Draft         IPv6 CE Router Requirements        September 2012


   WPD-1:  The IPv6 CE router MUST support DHCPv6 prefix delegation
           requesting router behavior as specified in [RFC3633] (IA_PD
           option).

   WPD-2:  The IPv6 CE router MAY indicate as a hint to the delegating
           router the size of the prefix it requires.  If so, it MUST
           ask for a prefix large enough to assign one /64 for each of
           its interfaces, rounded up to the nearest nibble, and SHOULD
           be configurable to ask for more.

   WPD-3:  The IPv6 CE router MUST be prepared to accept a delegated
           prefix size different from what is given in the hint.  If the
           delegated prefix is too small to address all of its
           interfaces, the IPv6 CE router SHOULD log a system management
           error.  [RFC6177] covers the recommendations for service
           providers for prefix allocation sizes.

   WPD-4:  By default, the IPv6 CE router MUST initiate DHCPv6 prefix
           delegation when either the M or O flags are set to 1 in a
           received Router Advertisement message.

   WPD-5:  If the delegated prefix(es) are aggregate route(s) of
           multiple, more-specific routes, the IPv6 CE router MUST
           discard packets that match the aggregate route(s), but not
           any of the more-specific routes.  In other words, the next
           hop for the aggregate route(s) should be the null
           destination.  This is necessary to prevent forwarding loops
           when some addresses covered by the aggregate are not
           reachable [RFC4632].

           (a)  The IPv6 CE router SHOULD send an ICMPv6 Destination
                Unreachable message in accordance with Section 3.1 of
                [RFC4443] back to the source of the packet, if the
                packet is to be dropped due to this rule.

   WPD-6:  If the IPv6 CE router requests both an IA_NA and an IA_PD
           option in DHCPv6, it MUST accept an IA_PD option in DHCPv6
           Advertise/Reply messages, even if the message does not
           contain any addresses, unless configured to only obtain its
           WAN IPv6 address via DHCPv6.  See
           [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-stateful-issues]

   WPD-7:  By default, an IPv6 CE router MUST NOT initiate any dynamic
           routing protocol on its WAN interface.

Internet-Draft         IPv6 CE Router Requirements        September 2012


   WPD-8:  The IPv6 CE Router SHOULD support the
           [I-D.ietf-dhc-pd-exclude] PD-Exclude option.

4.3.  LAN-Side Configuration

   The IPv6 CE router distributes configuration information obtained
   during WAN interface provisioning to IPv6 hosts and assists IPv6
   hosts in obtaining IPv6 addresses.  It also supports connectivity of
   these devices in the absence of any working WAN interface.

   An IPv6 CE router is expected to support an IPv6 end-user network and
   IPv6 hosts that exhibit the following characteristics:

   1.  Link-local addresses may be insufficient for allowing IPv6
       applications to communicate with each other in the end-user
       network.  The IPv6 CE router will need to enable this
       communication by providing globally scoped unicast addresses or
       ULAs [RFC4193], whether or not WAN connectivity exists.

   2.  IPv6 hosts should be capable of using SLAAC and may be capable of
       using DHCPv6 for acquiring their addresses.

   3.  IPv6 hosts may use DHCPv6 for other configuration information,
       such as the DNS_SERVERS option for acquiring DNS information.

   Unless otherwise specified, the following requirements apply to the
   IPv6 CE router's LAN interfaces only.

   ULA requirements:

   ULA-1:  The IPv6 CE router SHOULD be capable of generating a ULA
           prefix [RFC4193].

   ULA-2:  An IPv6 CE router with a ULA prefix MUST maintain this prefix
           consistently across reboots.

   ULA-3:  The value of the ULA prefix SHOULD be configurable.

   ULA-4:  By default, the IPv6 CE router MUST act as a site border
           router according to Section 4.3 of [RFC4193] and filter
           packets with local IPv6 source or destination addresses
           accordingly.

   ULA-5:  An IPv6 CE router MUST NOT advertise itself as a default
           router with a Router Lifetime greater than zero whenever all
           of its configured and delegated prefixes are ULA prefixes.

   LAN requirements:

Internet-Draft         IPv6 CE Router Requirements        September 2012


   L-1:   The IPv6 CE router MUST support router behavior according to
          Neighbor Discovery for IPv6 [RFC4861].

   L-2:   The IPv6 CE router MUST assign a separate /64 from its
          delegated prefix(es) (and ULA prefix if configured to provide
          ULA addressing) for each of its LAN interfaces.

   L-3:   An IPv6 CE router MUST advertise itself as a router for the
          delegated prefix(es) (and ULA prefix if configured to provide
          ULA addressing) using the "Route Information Option" specified
          in Section 2.3 of [RFC4191].  This advertisement is
          independent of having or not having IPv6 connectivity on the
          WAN interface.

   L-4:   An IPv6 CE router MUST NOT advertise itself as a default
          router with a Router Lifetime [RFC4861] greater than zero if
          it has no prefixes configured or delegated to it.

   L-5:   The IPv6 CE router MUST make each LAN interface an advertising
          interface according to [RFC4861].

   L-6:   In Router Advertisement messages ([RFC4861]), the Prefix
          Information option's A and L flags MUST be set to 1 by
          default.

   L-7:   The A and L flags' ([RFC4861]) settings SHOULD be user-
          configurable.

   L-8:   The IPv6 CE router MUST support a DHCPv6 server capable of
          IPv6 address assignment according to [RFC3315] OR a stateless
          DHCPv6 server according to [RFC3736] on its LAN interfaces.

   L-9:   Unless the IPv6 CE router is configured to support the DHCPv6
          IA_NA option, it SHOULD set the M flag to 0 and the O flag to
          1 in its Router Advertisement messages [RFC4861].

   L-10:  The IPv6 CE router MUST support providing DNS information in
          the DHCPv6 DNS_SERVERS and DOMAIN_LIST options [RFC3646].

   L-11:  The IPv6 CE router MUST support providing DNS information in
          the Router Advertisement Recursive DNS Server (RDNSS) and DNS
          Search List options.  Both options are specified in [RFC6106].

   L-12:  The IPv6 CE router SHOULD make available a subset of DHCPv6
          options (as listed in Section 5.3 of [RFC3736]) received from
          the DHCPv6 client on its WAN interface to its LAN-side DHCPv6
          server.

Internet-Draft         IPv6 CE Router Requirements        September 2012


   L-13:  If the delegated prefix changes, i.e., the current prefix is
          replaced with a new prefix without any overlapping time
          period, then the IPv6 CE router MUST immediately advertise the
          old prefix with a Preferred Lifetime of zero and a Valid
          Lifetime of either a) zero, or b) the lower of the current
          Valid Lifetime and two hours (which must be decremented in
          real time) in a Router Advertisement message as described in
          Section 5.5.3, (e) of [RFC4862].

   L-14:  The IPv6 CE router MUST send an ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable
          message, code 5 (Source address failed ingress/egress policy)
          for packets forwarded to it that use an address from a prefix
          that has been invalidated.

4.4.  Transition Technologies Support

4.4.1.  6rd

   6rd [RFC5969] specifies an automatic tunneling mechanism tailored to
   advance deployment of IPv6 to end users via a service provider's IPv4
   network infrastructure.  Key aspects include automatic IPv6 prefix
   delegation to sites, stateless operation, simple provisioning, and
   service that is equivalent to native IPv6 at the sites that are
   served by the mechanism.  It is expected that such traffic is
   forwarded over the CE Router's native IPv4 WAN interface, and not
   encapsulated in another tunnel.

   The CE Router SHOULD support 6rd functionality.  If 6rd is supported,
   it MUST be implemented according to [RFC5969].  The following CE
   Requirements also apply:

   6rd requirements:

   6RD-1:  The IPv6 CE router MUST support 6rd configuration via the 6rd
           DHCPv4 Option (212).  If the CE router has obtained an IPv4
           network address through some other means such as PPP, it
           SHOULD use the DHCPINFORM request message [RFC2131] to
           request the 6rd DHCPv4 Option.  The IPv6 CE router MAY use
           other mechanisms to configure 6rd parameters.  Such
           mechanisms are outside the scope of this document.

   6RD-2:  If the IPv6 CE router is capable of automated configuration
           of IPv4 through IPCP (i.e., over a PPP connection), it MUST
           support user-entered configuration of 6rd.

Internet-Draft         IPv6 CE Router Requirements        September 2012


   6RD-3:  If the CE router supports configuration mechanisms other than
           the 6rd DHCPv4 Option 212 (user-entered, TR-69, etc.), the CE
           router MUST support 6rd in "hub and spoke" mode. 6rd in "hub
           and spoke" requires all IPv6 traffic to go to the 6rd Border
           Relay.  In effect, this requirement removes the "direct
           connect to 6rd" route defined in Section 7.1.1 of [RFC5969].

   6RD-4:  A CE router MUST allow 6rd and native IPv6 WAN interfaces to
           be active alone as well as simultaneously in order to support
           coexistence of the two technologies during an incremental
           migration period such as a migration from 6rd to native IPv6.

   6RD-5:  Each packet sent on a 6rd or native WAN interface MUST be
           directed such that its source IP address is derived from the
           delegated prefix associated with the particular interface
           from which the packet is being sent[Section 4.3 [RFC3704]].

   6RD-6:  The CE router MUST allow different as well as identical
           delegated prefixes to be configured via each (6rd or native)
           WAN interface.

   6RD-7:  In the event that forwarding rules produce a tie between 6rd
           and native IPv6, by default, the IPv6 CE Router MUST prefer
           native IPv6.

4.4.2.  Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite)

   Dual-Stack Lite [RFC6333] enables both continued support for IPv4
   services and incentives for the deployment of IPv6.  It also de-
   couples IPv6 deployment in the Service Provider network from the rest
   of the Internet, making incremental deployment easier.  Dual-Stack
   Lite enables a broadband service provider to share IPv4 addresses
   among customers by combining two well-known technologies: IP in IP
   (IPv4-in-IPv6) and Network Address Translation (NAT).  It is expected
   that DS-Lite traffic is forwarded over the CE Router's native IPv6
   WAN interface, and not encapsulated in another tunnel.

   The IPv6 CE Router SHOULD implement DS-Lite functionality.  If DS-
   Lite is supported, it MUST be implemented according to [RFC6333].
   This document takes no position on simultaneous operation of Dual-
   Stack Lite and native IPv4.  The following CE Router requirements
   also apply:

   WAN requirements:

Internet-Draft         IPv6 CE Router Requirements        September 2012


   DLW-1:  The CE Router MUST support configuration of DS-Lite via the
           DS-Lite DHCPv6 option [RFC6334].  The IPv6 CE Router MAY use
           other mechanisms to configure DS-Lite parameters.  Such
           mechanisms are outside the scope of this document.

   DLW-2:  IPv6 CE Router MUST NOT perform IPv4 Network Address
           Translation (NAT) on IPv4 traffic encapsulated using DS-Lite.

   DLW-3:  If the IPv6 CE Router is configured with an IPv4 address on
           its WAN interface then the IPv6 CE Router SHOULD disable the
           DS-Lite B4 element.

4.5.  Security Considerations

   It is considered a best practice to filter obviously malicious
   traffic (e.g., spoofed packets, "Martian" addresses, etc.).  Thus,
   the IPv6 CE router ought to support basic stateless egress and
   ingress filters.  The CE router is also expected to offer mechanisms
   to filter traffic entering the customer network; however, the method
   by which vendors implement configurable packet filtering is beyond
   the scope of this document.

   Security requirements:

   S-1:  The IPv6 CE router SHOULD support [RFC6092].  In particular,
         the IPv6 CE router SHOULD support functionality sufficient for
         implementing the set of recommendations in [RFC6092],
         Section 4.  This document takes no position on whether such
         functionality is enabled by default or mechanisms by which
         users would configure it.

   S-2:  The IPv6 CE router SHOULD support ingress filtering in
         accordance with BCP 38 [RFC2827].  Note that this requirement
         was downgraded from a MUST from RFC 6204 due to the difficulty
         of implementation in the CE router and the feature's redundancy
         with upstream router ingress filtering.

   S-3:  If the IPv6 CE router firewall is configured to filter incoming
         tunneled data, the firewall SHOULD provide the capability to
         filter decapsulated packets from a tunnel.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

Internet-Draft         IPv6 CE Router Requirements        September 2012


Appendix A.  Changes from RFC 6204

   1.   Added IP transition technologies available in RFC form.

   2.   Changed requirement G-5 to augment the condition of losing IPv6
        default router(s) with loss of connectivity.

   3.   Removed requirement WAA-7 due to not reaching consensus by
        various service provider standards bodies.  The removal of text
        does not remove any critical functionality from the CE
        specification.

   4.   Changed requirement WAA-8 to qualify WAN behavior only if not
        configured to perform DHCPv6.  This way a deployment specific
        profile can mandate DHCPv6 numbered WAN without conflicting with
        this document.

   5.   Changed the WPD-2 requirement from MUST be configurable to
        SHOULD be configurable.

   6.   Changed requirement WPD-4 for a default behavior without
        compromising any prior specification of the CE device.  The
        change was needed by a specific layer 2 deployment which wanted
        to specify a MUST for DHCPv6 in their layer 2 profile and not
        conflict with this document.

   7.   Changed requirement WPD-7 to qualify text for DHCPv6.  Removed
        W-5 and WPD-5 because the text does not have consensus from the
        IETF DHC Working Group for what the final solution related to
        the removed requirements will be.

   8.   Added a new WAN DHCPv6 requirement for SOL_MAX_RT of DHCPv6 so
        that if an service provider does not have DHCPv6 service enabled
        CE routers do not send too frequent DHCPv6 requests to the
        service provider DHCPv6 server.

   9.   Changed requirement L-11 from SHOULD provide DNS options in the
        RA to MUST provide DNS option in the RA.

   10.  New requirement added to the Security Considerations section due
        to addition of transition technology.  The CE router filters
        decapsulated 6rd data.

   11.  Minor change involved changing ICMP to ICMPv6.

   12.  Added PCP client requirement for the WAN.
