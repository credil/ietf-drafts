                Internet Media Type application/sdpfrag
                     draft-ivov-dispatch-sdpfrag-03

Abstract

   This document registers the application/sdpfrag Multipurpose Internet
   Mail Extensions (MIME) media type.  This type is similar to
   application/sdp, but allows certain subsets of well formed session
   descriptions, as per the Session Description Protocol (SDP), to be
   represented instead of requiring a complete SDP session description.
   The "a=candidate" lines that are incrementally exchanged between
   Trickle ICE agents are one example usage of the application/sdpfrag.

1.  Introduction

   The application/sdp MIME media type defined in [RFC4566] carries an
   entire well formed SDP session description.  Yet, creating such a
   description may sometimes require a relatively long time as, for
   example, would be the case when the Interactive Connectivity
   Establishment (ICE) [RFC5245] protocol is in use and candidates need
   to be acquire in different, often time consuming methods.  Some
   applications may therefore choose to use mechanisms like Trickle ICE
   [I-D.ivov-mmusic-trickle-ice] that would allow them to send initial
   session descriptions with only readily available information and then
   exchange candidates only when they become available.

   This document does NOT provide a mechanism to segment an SDP session
   description into multiple pieces for separate transport and later
   reassemble.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Definition: application/sdpfrag

   A valid application/sdpfrag part is one that could be obtained by
   starting with some valid SDP session description and deleting any
   number of lines.

   [TODO maybe mention that we can only do frags with the declarative
   parts of an SDP offer/answer and not with the ones used in
   negotiations.]
