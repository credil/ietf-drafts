1.  Introduction

   Proactive Connectivity Verification (CV), Continuity Check (CC), and
   Remote Defect Indication (RDI) for the MPLS Transport Profile
   [RFC6428] are applicable to all constructs of the MPLS-TP, including
   pseudowires (PWs).  If control plane is used to operate and manage PW
   s then the procedures defined in [RFC5085] and [RFC5885] should be
   used to select proper type of Control Channel and corresponding type
   of Connectivity Verification.  This document specifies how signaling
   and selection processes are modified to ensure backward compatibility
   and allow use of proactive CV-CC-RDI over MPLS-TP PWs.

2.  MPLS-TP CC-CV on Pseudowires

   PW VCCV can support several CV Types, and can support arbitrary
   combination of CV modes advertised in the CV Types field of VCCV
   Interface Parameter sub-TLV [RFC4446], [RFC4447].  Currently six
   types of CV been defined for PW VCCV.  This document introduces four
   new CV types and, to accommodate them, a new VCCV Extended CV
   parameter for PW Interface Parameters Sub-TLV is defined.

2.1.  VCCV Extended CV Advertisement sub-TLV

   The format of VCCV Extended CV Advertisement is a TLV where:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    | Type = 0x19 |    Length     |   CV Type    |   Reserved     |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                Figure 1: VCCV Extended CV parameter format

   The Length field is the length of the sub-TLV, including type and the
   Length field itself.  The minimum length is 4.  It it isrecommended
   that extensions to the sub-TLV be done in 4 bytes increments with
   Reserved field being set to zero on transmit and ignored on receipt.

   The Reserved field must be set to zeroes on transmit and ignored on
   receive.

   The CV Type field is a bitmask that lists types of CV monitoring that
   a PE is capable to support.  The VCCV Extended CV parameter sub-TLV
   MUST appear in combination with the VCCV parameter sub-TLV.  If the
   VCCV parameter sub-TLV is missing then the VCCV Extended CV parameter
   sub-TLV SHOULD be ignored.

2.2.  MPLS-TP CC-CV Types

   [RFC6428] defines coordinated and independent modes of monitoring
   point-to-point bi-directional connection that can be applied to
   monitoring PWs.  At the same time [RFC6310] defines how BFD-based OAM
   can map and be mapped to status of an Attachment Circuit.  Thus there
   could be four MPLS-TP CV types as combination of modes and
   functionality:

   +---------------+-------------------+-------------------------------+
   |     Modes     |  Fault Detection  |   Fault Detection and Status  |
   |               |        Only       |           Signalling          |
   +---------------+-------------------+-------------------------------+
   |  Independent  |        0x01       |              0x02             |
   |      Mode     |                   |                               |
   |  Coordinated  |        0x04       |              0x08             |
   |      Mode     |                   |                               |
   +---------------+-------------------+-------------------------------+

2.3.  MPLS-TP CC-CV Type Operation

   Connectivity verification according to [RFC6428] is part of MPLS-TP
   CC/CV operation that can be used with VCCV Control Channel Type 1
   [RFC5085] .  If VCCV CC Type 1 selected, then PEs MAY select one of
   MPLS-TP CC-CV types as VCCV CV mechanism to be used for this PW.

2.4.  CV Type Selection

   CV selection rules that have been defined in Section 7 of [RFC5085]
   and updated Section 4 of [RFC5885] are augmented in this document.

   If VCCV Control Channel Type 1 is chosen according to Section 7
   [RFC5085] and common set of proactive CV types advertized by both PEs
   includes MPLS-TP CC-CV types and some BFD CV types, then MPLS-TP
   CC-CV takes precedence over any type of BFD CV.  If multiple MPLS-TP
   CV types advertised by both PEs, then following list sorted in
   descending priority order is used:

   1.  0x08 - coordinated mode for PW Fault Detection and AC/PW Fault
       Status Signaling

   2.  0x04 - coordinated mode for PW Fault Detection only

   3.  0x02 - independent mode for PW Fault Detection and AC/PW Fault
       Status Signaling

   4.  0x01 - independent mode for PW Fault Detection only


3.  IANA Considerations

   The PW Interface Parameters Sub-TLV registry is defined in [RFC4446].

   IANA is requested to reserve a new PW Interface Parameters Sub-TLV
   type as follows:

   +-------------+--------+----------------------------+---------------+
   |  Parameter  | Length |         Description        | Reference     |
   |      ID     |        |                            |               |
   +-------------+--------+----------------------------+---------------+
   |     0x19    | 4      | VCCV Extended CV Parameter | This document |
   +-------------+--------+----------------------------+---------------+

3.1.  VCCV Extended CV Types

   IANA is requested to set up a registry of VCCV Extended CV Types.
   These are 8 bit values.  Extended CV Type values 0x01, 0x02, 0x04 and
   0x08 are specified in Section 2.2 of this document.  The remaining
   values (0x10 through 0x80) are to be assigned by IANA using the "IETF
   Consensus" policy defined in [RFC5226].  A VCCV Extended Control
   Verification Type description and a reference to an RFC approved by
   the IESG are required for any assignment from this registry.

   +--------------+----------------------------------------------------+
   |  Bit(Value)  | Description                                        |
   +--------------+----------------------------------------------------+
   | Bit 0 (0x01) | Independent mode for PW Fault Detection only       |
   | Bit 1 (0x02) | Independent mode for PW Fault Detection and AC/PW  |
   |              | Fault Status Signaling                             |
   | Bit 2 (0x04) | Coordinated mode for PW Fault Detection only       |
   | Bit 3 (0x08) | Coordinated mode for PW Fault Detection and AC/PW  |
   |              | Fault Status Signaling                             |
   | Bit 4 (0x10) | Reserved                                           |
   | Bit 5 (0x20) | Reserved                                           |
   | Bit 6 (0x40) | Reserved                                           |
   | Bit 7 (0x80) | Reserved                                           |
   +--------------+----------------------------------------------------+

4.  Security Considerations

   Routers that implement the additional CV Type defined herein are
   subject to the same security considerations as defined in [RFC5085],
   [RFC5880], [RFC5881], and [RFC6428].  This specification does not
   raise any additional security issues beyond these.
