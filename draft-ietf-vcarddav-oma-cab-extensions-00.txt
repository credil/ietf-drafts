vCard Format extension : represent vCard extensions defined by the Open
        Mobile Alliance (OMA) Converged Address Book (CAB) group
               draft-ietf-vcarddav-oma-cab-extensions-00

Abstract

   This document defines extensions to the vCard data format for
   representing and exchanging certain contact information.  The
   properties covered here have been defined by the Open Mobile Alliance
   Converged Address Book group, in order to synchronize, using OMA Data
   Synchronization, important contact fields that were not already
   defined in the base vCard 4.0 specification.

Internet-Draft                vCard-OMA-CAB                 October 2011


1.  Introduction

   [[anchor1: Barry: There are still quite a few review comments that
   are not incorporated into this version.  I have included those
   comments in the appropriate places with the XML "cref" element, so
   they will show up within "[[ ]]", as this one does.  I am still
   working on these, but please feel free to help me resolve these
   comments as we go through the document again.]]

   Synchronization of an Open Mobile Alliance Converged Address Book
   [OMA-CAB], using Open Mobile Alliance Data Synchronization (OMA-DS),
   commonly uses vCard as an exchange format between the DS Server and
   the DS Client.  In order to properly perform synchronization of an
   OMA-CAB, the CAB specification defines some important CAB contact
   fields not already defined in the vCard base specification.  This
   document re-uses the definitions found in the OMA-CAB specification
   and describes them as vCard extensions.  The following sections
   define the necessary Properties and Parameters.

1.1.  Terminology Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Syntax specifications shown here use the augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF) as described in [RFC5234], and are specified as in the base
   vcard specification [RFC6350].


2.  vCard Extensions : Properties

   The following sections define the CAB Properties.

   [[anchor3: Simon: As I start reading section 2.1, I'm still wondering
   what OMA-CAB does and where I can go for more information.  So maybe
   a few more introduction sentences with a reference would be
   helpful.]]

   [[anchor4: Alexey: I would like to see at least statements about
   whether various properties have corresponding registries of allowed
   values, how unrecognized values should be treated (if allowed),
   etc.]]

2.1.  Property : CONTACT-LANGUAGE

Internet-Draft                vCard-OMA-CAB                 October 2011


   Namespace:


   Property name:  CONTACT-LANGUAGE


   Purpose:  To specify the language(s) that may be used for contacting
       the individual associated with the vCard.


   Value type:  A single language-tag value.


   Cardinality:  *


   Property parameters:  PREF, INDEX, LANGUAGE-PROFICIENCY-TYPE,
       LANGUAGE-FLUENCY-TYPE


   Description:

       [[anchor6: Simon: What's the difference between CONTACT-LANGUAGE
       and LANG?  If it's only for supporting the new parameters, why
       not simply add the new parameters to the LANG property?]]

       [[anchor7: Peter StA: I like CONTACT-LANGUAGE and I'm wondering
       why we didn't define that already in the base vCard4 spec.]]

       [[anchor8: Chris: The CONTACT-LANGUAGE property seems useful, but
       I don't see how to specify that I can read and speak a language
       but not write the language.  [Alexey: Or to speak, but not read a
       language.]]]

       [[anchor9: Dany: We decided to use LANG instead of CONTACT-
       LANGUAGE.]]


   Format definition:

       CONTACT-LANGUAGE-param =  pref-param / LANGUAGE-PROFICIENCY-TYPE-
               param / LANGUAGE-FLUENCY-TYPE-param / INDEX-param

       CONTACT-LANGUAGE-value =  language-tag

   Example:

       CONTACT-LANGUAGE;INDEX=1;
         LANGUAGE-PROFICIENCY-TYPE=speak;
         LANGUAGE-FLUENCY-TYPE=fluent:en


2.2.  Property : SERVICE

   Namespace:


   Property name:  SERVICE


   Purpose:  To specify the aliases used on different sites by the
       object that the vCard refers to.


   Value type:  A single structured value consisting of 3 values
       separated by the SEMI-COLON character (U+0059) :

       1.  label : indicating a free-text description of the service

       2.  alias : indicating the alias identifier string used for a
           service

       3.  url : indicating the URL pointing to the service resource


   Cardinality:  *


   Property parameters:  INDEX


   Description:

       [[anchor11: Peter StA: SERVICE seems somewhat underspecified; in
       particular the "label" is just a free-form name for the service,
       but it seems that different people might call the same service by
       different names, leading to confusion (e.g., "facebook" vs.
       "FaceBook", "Google" vs. "Gmail" vs. "Google Talk").]]

       [[anchor12: Chris: The SERVICE property seems vague, I prefer the
       SOCIALPROFILE name in draft-george-vcarddav-vcard-extension,
       although having a way to distinguish the unique identifier used
       by that social service seems useful.]]

Internet-Draft                vCard-OMA-CAB                 October 2011


       [[anchor13: Cyrus: WRT SERVICE I would like to draw people's
       attention to
       http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-daboo-vcard-service-type (which
       is now expired).  This takes a different approach of defining a
       SERVICE-TYPE parameter for use on existing properties such as
       EMAIL and IM.  This allow those communications properties to be
       "tagged" with the service provider identifier.]]

       [[anchor14: Cyrus: I wonder whether instead of SERVICE we should
       be using the existing vCard URL property combined with SERVICE-
       TYPE.  The existing property already states "social networking
       site identifiers" as one possible use case.  I realize this might
       make it a little bit harder to do a simple one-to-one mapping
       with OMA attributes, but I do think we should try and re-use
       existing vCard properties where ever it makes sense.]]


   Format definition:

       SERVICE-param =  INDEX-param

       SERVICE-value =  text


   Example:

       SERVICE;INDEX=1:facebook;Facili Tie;

2.3.  Property : EXPERTISE

   Namespace:


   Property name:  EXPERTISE


   Purpose:  To specify the expertise(s) of the object that the vCard
       refers to.


   Value type:  A single string value.

   Description:  A hobby, as opposed to an interest (see Section 2.5) is
       an activity that one actively engages in for entertainment,
       intellectual stimulation, creative expression, or the like.

       *   "Art" might be a hobby if one actively sculpts or paints.

       *   "Tennis" might be a hobby if one enjoys playing, rather than
           just watching matches.

   Description:  An interest, as opposed to a hobby (see Section 2.4) is
       an activity or topic that one finds interesting, but doesn't
       necessarily actively engage in.

       *   "Art" might be an interest if one likes looking at art, but
           doesn't create art.

       *   "Tennis" might be an interest if one enjoys watching matches,
           but doesn't play.

2.6.  Property : PUBLICNOTE

   Namespace:


   Property name:  PUBLICNOTE


   Purpose:  To specify additional information associated with the
       object the vCard refers to.


   Value type:  A single string value


   Cardinality:  *

Internet-Draft                vCard-OMA-CAB                 October 2011


   Description:

       [[anchor17: Peter StA: How is PUBLICNOTE different from NOTE in
       the base spec?  The example ("Out of my office today") seems more
       like presence than vCard.]]

       [[anchor18: Chris: I don't understand PUBLICNOTE or how it might
       be used or presented in a UI.  The example looks like it's going
       to be used as a presence status or something like that.  Seems
       too vague to be useful.]]

       [[anchor19: Dany: Yes, it looks like information stored by a
       presence server but it is not because CAB doesn't deal with
       presence information.  NOTE could be used to stored somthing like
       "This is my personal card" and PUBLICNOTE could be used to store
       something like "I would like to reach tennis players in New-
       York".  So, my suggestion is to change the example with something
       which represents a more permanent information.  Examples could
       be, "I live in Beijing", "Waiting for a job", "I spoke to Barack
       OBAMA", "Motorbike fanatic".  Hence, to me, NOTE is a permanent
       information (like "this is ALICE's personal card"), PUBLICNOTE is
       a semi-permanent information (like "Waiting for a job"), and
       presence is a temporary information (like "out of my office
       today").]]

       [[anchor20: Barry: I think the decision was to use PUBLICNOTE,
       but make the description clearer.  I will take a stab at that.]]


   Format definition:

       PUBLICNOTE-param =  language-param

       PUBLICNOTE-value =  text


   Example:

       PUBLICNOTE;LANGUAGE=en:Out of my office today

   Purpose:  To specify the organization-directory of the object the
       vCard represents.


   Value type:  A single URI value.


   Cardinality:  *


   Property parameters:  PREF, INDEX


   Description:

       [[anchor22: Chris: ORG-DIRECTORY is interesting, but I'd like an
       example with an LDAP URL.]]

       [[anchor23: Alexey: Additionally: does use of a particular URI
       scheme implies a particular data format?  HTTP URIs (for example)
       don't provide enough information about format of the resource by
       themselves.]]

       [[anchor24: Dany: Need better description of what ORG-DIRECTORY
       means and eventually mapping with SOURCE.]]

   considerations -- the PUBLICNOTE is sensitive.  The SERVICE or
   SOCIALPROFILE enables automated "friend invite" spam.]]


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the following entries to the vCard
   Properties registry, defined in [RFC6350] section 10.3.1.
