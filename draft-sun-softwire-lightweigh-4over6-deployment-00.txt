            Deployment Considerations for Lightweight 4over6
           draft-sun-softwire-lightweigh-4over6-deployment-00

Abstract

   Lightweight 4over6 is a mechanism which moves the translation
   function from tunnel concentrator (AFTR) to initiators (B4s), and
   hence reduces the mapping scale on the concentrator to per-customer
   level.  This document discusses various deployment models of
   lightweight 4over6.  It also describes the deployment considerations
   and applicability of the lightweight 4over6 architecture.

1.  Introduction

   Lightweight 4over6 [I-D.cui-softwire-b4-translated-ds-lite] is an
   extension to DS-Lite which simplifies the AFTR module [RFC6333] with
   distributed NAT function among B4 elements.  The Initiator in
   lightweight 4over6 is provisioned with an IPv6 address, an IPv4
   address and a port-set.  It performs NAPT on end user's packets with
   the provisioned IPv4 address and port-set.  IPv4 packets are
   forwarded between the Initiator and the Concentrator over a Softwire
   using IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation.  The Concentrator maintains one
   mapping entry per subscriber with the IPv6 address, IPv4 address and
   port-set.  Therefore, this extension removes the NAT44 module from
   the AFTR and replaces the session-based NAT table to a per-subscriber
   based mapping table.  This should relax the requirement to create
   dynamic session-based log entries.  This mechanism preserves the
   dynamic feature of IPv4/IPv6 address binding as in DS-Lite, so it
   won't require to couple IPv4 and IPv6 address schemas as MAP
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port] requires.  This document
   discusses various deployment models of Lightweight 4over6.  It also
   describes the deployment considerations and applicability of the
   lightweight 4over6 architecture.

   Terminology of this document follows the definitions and
   abbreviations of [I-D.cui-softwire-b4-translated-ds-lite].

3.  Case Studies

   Lightweight 4over6 can be either deployed in a standalone way, or
   incrementally coexistent with DS-Lite[RFC6333].  It is suitable for
   operators who would like to keep IPv6 and IPv4 addressing separated.
   The dynamic feature of IPv4 address and port-sets provision makes
   more efficient usage of IPv4 resource.  For operator who only have
   many small and discontinuous IPv4 blocks available to provide IPv4
   over IPv6, this mechanism won't require to administrate and manage
   many IPv4 and IPv6 mapping rules planning in CPE or MAP domains in
   the network.

3.1.  case 1: Standalone Deployment Scenario

   Lightweight 4over6 can be deployed in a new residential network
   (depicted in Figure1).  In this scenario, an Initiator would acquire
   port-restricted IPv4 address after user authentication process and
   IPv6 provisioning process.  It then uses IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel to build
   a softwire to deliver IPv4 services to the Concentrator in the
   network.  The Concentrator supports only Lightweight 4over6 which
   keeps the mapping between Initiator's IPv6 address and its allocated
   IPv4 address + port set.  There is no need to interact with other
   transition techniques.  More detailed considerations would be
   discussed in section 4.

   Figure 1 Standalone Deployment Scenario

3.2.  case 2: DS-Lite Coexistent scenario with Integrated AFTR

   Lightweight 4over6 can be deployed incrementally in existing DS-Lite
   network architecture(depicted in Figure2).  In this case, DS-Lite has
   been deployed in the network.  Later in the deployment schedule, the
   operator decided to introduce Lightweight 4over6 Concentrator in the
   same AFTR.  Therefore, the same concentrator needs to identify the

   two distinct mechanisms based on encapsulated subscriber's IPv4
   address.  Lightweight 4over6 and DS-Lite would use the same
   addressing scheme, routing policy, user management policy, etc., and
   they can use the same DHCPv6 option [RFC6334] to inform the FQDN of
   concentrator.

3.3.  case 3: DS-Lite Coexistent scenario with Seperated AFTR

   Lightweight 4over6 can be also deployed incrementally in existing DS-
   Lite architecture, but not coupled tightly with DS-Lite AFTR
   (depicted in Figure3).  For example, DS-Lite AFTR might be deployed
   distributed in access routers, while lightweight 4over6 concentrator
   might be deployed centralized in a MAN.  This deployment model has
   the advantage of high flexibility.  However, since there are distinct
   addresses for DS-Lite AFTR and lightweight 4over6 concentrator,
   seperated tunnel end-point discovery mechanisms should be introduced.

4.  Overall Deployment Considerations

4.1.  Addressing and Routing

   In lightweight 4over6, it is suggested to adopt separated IPv4/IPv6
   addressing schemes.  IPv4 address pools are configured centralized in
   concentrator for IPv6 subscribers.  These IPv4 address routing
   entries also should be imported into IPv4 Internet accordingly.

   For IPv6 addressing and routing, there are no additional addressing
   and routing requirements.  The process of IPv6 address assignment and
   routing announcement can be integrated with existing IPv6 address
   allocation process, e.g. using PPPoE or IPoE, etc.  IPv6 address
   pools are configured in DHCPv6 server.  No extra routing requirement
   is needed to taken into consideration.

4.2.  Port-set Management

   In lightweight 4over6, each initiator will get its restricted IPv4
   address and a valid port-set.  This port-set assignment should be
   synchronized between port management server and the concentrator.
   Normally, port management server is responsible for allocating port
   restricted IPv4 address to initiator.  It can be located in the
   concentrator itself or relayed by the concentrator to pass through
   port restricted parameters.  Different mechanisms including PCP-
   extended protocol [I-D.tsou-pcp-natcoord], DHCP-extended protocol or
   IPCP-extended protocol, etc., can be applied.

   o  DHCP-based mechanism is usually designed for stable port
      management, which means only static port set can be allocated at
      one time.  In this case, the DHCPv4 protocol should be extended to
      support port-set allocation process [I-D.bajko-pripaddrassign].
      Besides, with the concentrator acting as the DHCP server or relay,
      DHCPv4 should be performed over IPv6
      [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6].

   o  PCP-based mechanism is usually more flexible.  An initiator can
      launch multiple PCP requests simultaneously to acquire a number
      ports within the same IPv4 address, or use [I-D.tsou-pcp-natcoord]
      for one-time port-set allocation.

   o  IPCP-based mechanism[RFC6431] is more suitable for concentrators
      deployed in BNG.

4.3.  Concentrator Discovery

   A lightweight 4over6 initiator should discover the concentrator's
   IPv6 address during startup.  This IPv6 address can be learned



Sun, et al.             Expires September 6, 2012               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        lightweigh-4over6-deployment            March 2012


   through a variety of methods, ranging from an out-of-band mechanism,
   manual configuration, to a DHCPv6 option.  For case 1 and case 2 in
   the above section, lightweight 4over6 can make use of existing DS-
   Lite discovery mechanism as defined in [RFC6334].  For case 3, we
   suggest that a new DHCPv6 option should be defined to carry the
   concentrator's IPv6 address.

5.  Concentrator Deployment Consideration

5.1.  Common considerations with DS-Lite deployment

   As lightweight 4over6 is an extension to DS-Lite, some considerations
   in terms of Interface consideration, MTU, Fragment, Lawful Intercept
   Considerations, Blacklisting a shared IPv4 Address, AFTR's Policies,
   AFTR Impacts on Accounting Process, etc., in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-deployment] can also be applied here.  In
   this document, we only discuss some considerations specific to
   lightweight 4over6.

5.2.  Logging at the Concentrator

   In lightweight 4over6, only subscriber-based logging records
   including IPv4 address, IPv6 address and port set should be sent to a
   centrilized syslog server.  Since this mechanism reduces the number
   of simultaneous address mappings of each customer on concentrator to
   one, it makes concentrator logging much more feasible.  The port set
   algorithm implemented in lightweight 4over6 concentrator should be
   syncronized with the one implemented in logging system.

5.3.  Reliability Considerations of Concentrator

   In lightweight 4over6, port set allocation should be conducted before
   packet processing.  As a result, when one concentrator encountered a
   failure, a backup concentrator should either have the binding record
   beforehand, or trigger a port management echo to the initiator.  The
   first choice is a hot standby mode, while the second can be achieved
   by sending an ICMPv6 error request on getting an un-established
   binding record from the initiator.

5.4.  Placement of AFTR

   Normally, the concentrator can be deployed in either a "centralized
   model" or a "distributed model".

   In the "centralized model", the concentrator could be located at the
   higher place, e.g. at the exit of MAN, etc.  Since the concentrator
   has good scalability and can handle numerous concurrent sessions, we
   recommend to adopt the "centralized model" for lightweight 4over6 as
   it is cost-effective and easy to manage.

   In the "distributed model", concentrator is usually integrated with
   the BRAS/SR.  Since newly emerging customers might be distributed in
   the whole Metro area, we have to deploy concentrator on all BRAS/SRs.
   This will cost a lot in the initial phase of the IPv6 transition
   period.

Internet-Draft        lightweigh-4over6-deployment            March 2012


5.5.  Port set algorithm consideration

   Since port randomization algorithm must use ports within the port
   set, it may cause the port randomization algorithm more predictable.
   Therefore, non-continuous port set algorithms (e.g. as defined in
   [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port]) can be introduced to
   further improve the security.

Internet-Draft        lightweigh-4over6-deployment            March 2012


6.  Initiator Deployment Consideration

6.1.  Bridging mode and routing mode

   In routing mode, the initiator runs a standard NAT44 [RFC3022] using
   the allocated public address as external IP and ports via DHCPv6
   option.  When receiving an IPv4 packet with private source address
   from its end hosts, it performs NAT44 function by translating the
   source address into public and selecting a port from the allocated
   port-set.  Then it encapsulates the packet with the concentrator's
   IPv6 address as destination IPv6 address, and forwards it to the
   concentrator.

   For the bridging mode, end host should run a software performing
   initiators' functionalities.  In this case, end host gets public
   address directly.  It is also suggested that the host run a local NAT
   to map randomly generated ports into the restricted, valid port-set.
   Another solution is to have the IP stack to only assign ports within
   the restricted, valid range to applications.  Either way the host
   guarantees that every source port number in the outgoing packets
   falls into the allocated port-set.

6.2.  ALG consideration

   In lightweight 4over6, the initiator is responsible for performing
   ALG functions (e.g., SIP, FTP), as well as supporting NAT Traversal
   mechanisms (e.g., UPnP, NAT-PMP, manual mapping configuration).  This
   is no different from the standard IPv4 NAT today.

   Since there is no address and port mapping in the concentrator, the
   ALG is no longer needed in the carrier-side network.

1.  Appendix:Experimental Result

   We have deployed lightweight 4over6 in our operational network of
   HuNan province, China.  It is designed for broadband access network,
   and different versions of initiator have been implemented including a
   linksys box, a software client for windows XP, vista and Windows 7.
   It can be integrated with existing dial-up mechanisms such as PPPoE,
   etc.  The major objectives listed below aimed to verify the
   functionality and performance of lightweight 4over6:

   o  Verify how to deploy lightweight 4over6 in a practical network.

   o  Verify the impact of applications with lightweight 4over6.

   o  Verify the performance of lightweight 4over6.

   Figure 2 Lightweight 4over6 experiment topology

   In this deployment model, concentrator is co-located with a extended
   PCP server to assign restricted IPv4 address and port set for
   initiator.  It also triggers subscriber-based logging event to a
   centrilized syslog server.  IPv6 address pools for subscribers have

Internet-Draft        lightweigh-4over6-deployment            March 2012


   been distributed to BRASs for configuration, while the public
   available IPv4 address pools are configured by the centralized
   concentrator with a default address sharing ratio.  It is rather
   flexible for IPv6 addressing and routing, and there is little impact
   on existing IPv6 architecture.

   In our experiment, initiator will firstly get its IPv6 address and
   delegated prefix through PPPoE, and then initiate a PCP-extended
   request to get public IPv4 address and its valid port set.  The
   concentrator will thus create a subscriber-based state accordingly,
   and notify syslog server with {IPv6 address, IPv4 address, port set,
   timestamp}.

1.2.  Experimental results

   In our trial, we mainly focused on application test and performance
   test.  The applications have widely include web, email, Instant
   Message, ftp, telnet, SSH, video, Video Camera, P2P, online game,
   voip and so on.  For performance test, we have measured the
   parameters of concurrent session numbers and throughput performance.

   The experimental results are listed as follows:

   The performance test for concentrator is taken on a normal PC.  Due
   to limitations of the PC hardware, the overall throughput is limited
   to around 800 Mbps.  However, it can still support more than one
   hundred million concurrent sessions.

1.3.  Conclusions

   From the experiment, we can have the following conclusions:

   o  Lightweight 4over6 has good scalability.  As it is a lightweight
      solution which only maintains per-subscriber state information, it
      can easily support a large amount of concurrent subscribers.

   o  Lightweight 4over6 can be deployed rapidly.  There is no
      modification to existing addressing and routing system in our
      operational network.  And it is simple to achieve traffic logging.

   o  Lightweight 4over6 can support a majority of current IPv4
      applications.
