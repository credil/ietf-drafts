INTERNET DRAFT          E-TREE Support in E-VPN            June 21, 2012


1  Introduction

   The Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) has defined a rooted-multipoint
   Ethernet service known as Ethernet Tree (E-Tree). In an E-Tree
   service, endpoints are labeled as either Root or Leaf sites. Root
   sites can communicate with all other sites. Leaf sites can
   communicate with Root sites but not with other Leaf sites. 

   [ETREE-FMWK] proposes the solution framework for supporting E-Tree
   service in MPLS networks. The document identifies the functional
   components of the overall solution to emulate E-Tree services in
   addition to Ethernet LAN (E-LAN) services on an existing MPLS
   network.

   [E-VPN] is a solution for multipoint L2VPN services, with advanced
   multi-homing capabilities, using BGP for distributing customer/client
   MAC address reach-ability information over the MPLS/IP network.

   This document discusses how the functional requirements for E-Tree
   service can be easily met with E-VPN. 

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [KEYWORDS].


2  E-Tree Scenarios and E-VPN Support

   In this section, we will categorize support for E-Tree into three
   different scenarios, depending on the nature of the site association
   (Root/Leaf) per PE or per Ethernet Segment:

   - Leaf OR Root site(s) per PE

   - Leaf AND Root site(s) per PE

   - Leaf AND Root site(s) per Ethernet Segment


2.1 Scenario 1: Leaf OR Root site(s) per PE

   In this scenario, a PE may have Root sites OR Leaf sites for a given
   VPN instance, but not both concurrently. The PE may have both Root
   and Leaf sites albeit for different VPNs. Every Ethernet Segment
   connected to the PE is uniquely identified as either a Root or a Leaf
   site.

3 Operation

   [E-VPN] defines the notion of an Ethernet Segment which can be
   readily used to identify a Root and/or Leaf site in E-TREE services.
   In other words, [E-VPN] has inherent capability to support E-TREE
   services without defining any new BGP routes and/or attributes. It
   only requires a  minor modification to the existing procedures as
   shown in this section.

   The following procedure is used consistently for all the scenarios
   highlighted in the previous section. In order to apply the proper
   egress filtering, which varies based on whether a packet is sent from
   a Root or a Leaf, the MPLS-encapsulated frames MUST be tagged with an
   indication of whether they originated from a Root or a Leaf Ethernet
   Segment. This can be achieved in E-VPN through the use of the ESI
   MPLS label, since this label identifies the Ethernet Segment of
   origin of a given frame. For E-Tree service, the ESI MPLS label MUST
   be used to encapsulate not only multi-destination frames (i.e.
   broadcast, multicast & unknown unicast), but also known unicast
   frames. The egress PE determines whether or not to forward a
   particular frame to an Ethernet Segment depending on the split-
   horizon rule defined in [E-VPN]:

   - If the ESI Label indicates that the source Ethernet Segment is a
   Root, then the frame can be forwarded on a segment granted that it
   passes the split-horizon check.

   - If the ESI Label indicates that the source Ethernet Segment is a
   Leaf, then the frame can be forwarded only on a Root segment, granted
   that it passes the split-horizon check.

   When advertising the ESI MPLS label for a given Ethernet Segment, a
   PE must indicate whether the corresponding ESI is a Root or a Leaf
   site. This can be done by encoding the Root or Leaf indication in the

   Flags field of the ESI MPLS label Extended Community attribute ([E-
   VPN] Section 8) to indicate Root/Leaf status. 

   In the case where a multi-homed Ethernet Segment has both Root and
   Leaf sites attached, two ESI MPLS labels are allocated and
   advertised: one ESI MPLS label denotes Root and the other denotes
   Leaf. The ingress PE imposes the right ESI MPLS label depending on
   whether the Ethernet frame originated from the Root or Leaf site on
   that Ethernet Segment. The mechanism by which the PE identifies
   whether a given frame originated from a Root or Leaf site on the
   segment is outside the scope of this document. In the case where a
   multi-homed Ethernet Segment has either Root or Leaf sites attached,
   then a single ESI MPL label is allocated and advertised.

   Furthermore, a PE advertises two special ESI MPLS labels: one for
   Root and another for Leaf. These are used by remote PEs for traffic
   originating from single-homed segments and for multi-homed segments
   that are not connected to the advertising PE. Note that these special
   labels are advertised on a per PE basis (i.e. each PE advertises only
   two such special labels).

   In addition to egress filtering (which is a MUST requirement), an E-
   VPN PE implementation MAY provide topology constraint among the PEs
   belonging to the same EVI associated with an E-TREE service. The
   purpose of this topology constraint is to avoid having PEs with only
   host Leaf sites importing and processing BGP MAC routes from each
   other, thereby unnecessarily exhausting their RIB tables. However, as
   soon as a Root site is added to a Leaf PE, then that PE needs to
   process MAC routes from all other Leaf PEs and add them to its
   forwarding table. To support such topology constrain in E-VPN, two
   BGP Route-Targets (RTs) are used for every E-VPN Instance (EVI): one
   RT is associated with the Root sites and the other is associated with
   the Leaf sites. On a per EVI basis, every PE exports the single RT
   associated with its type of site(s). Furthermore, a PE with Root
   site(s) imports both Root and Leaf RTs, whereas a PE with Leaf
   site(s) only imports the Root RT. If for a given EVI, the PEs can
   eventually have both Leaf and Root sites attached, even though they
   may start as  Root-only or Leaf-only PEs, then it is recommended to
   use a single RT per EVI and avoid additional configuration and
   operational overhead. If the number of EVIs is very large (e.g., more
   than 32K or 64K), then RT type 0 as defined in [RFC4360] SHOULD be
   used; otherwise, RT type 2 is sufficient.


   Per [ETREE-FMWK], a generic E-Tree service supports all of the
   following traffic flows:

        - Ethernet Unicast from Root to Roots & Leaf

INTERNET DRAFT          E-TREE Support in E-VPN            June 21, 2012


        - Ethernet Unicast from Leaf to Root
        - Ethernet Broadcast/Multicast from Root to Roots & Leafs
        - Ethernet Broadcast/Multicast from Leaf to Roots

   A particular E-Tree service may need to support all of the above
   types of flows or only a select subset, depending on the target
   application. In the case where unicast flows need not be supported,
   the L2VPN PEs can avoid performing any MAC learning function. 

   In the subsections that follow, we will describe the operation of E-
   VPN to support E-Tree service with and without MAC learning.


3.1 E-Tree with MAC Learning

   The PEs implementing an E-Tree service must perform MAC learning when
   unicast traffic flows must be supported from Root to Leaf or from
   Leaf to Root sites. In this case, the PE with Root sites performs MAC
   learning in the data-path over the Ethernet Segments, and advertises
   reachability in E-VPN MAC Advertisement routes. These routes will be
   imported by PEs that have Leaf sites as well as by PEs that have Root
   sites, in a given EVI. Similarly, the PEs with Leaf sites perform MAC
   learning in the data-path over their Ethernet Segments, and advertise
   reachability in E-VPN MAC Advertisement routes which are imported
   only by PEs with at least one Root site in the EVI. A PE with only
   Leaf sites will not import these routes. PEs with Root and/or Leaf
   sites may use the Ethernet A-D routes for aliasing (in the case of
   multi-homed segments) and for mass MAC withdrawal.

   To support multicast/broadcast from Root to Leaf sites, either a P2MP
   tree rooted at the PE(s) with the Root site(s) or ingress replication
   can be used. The multicast tunnels are set up through the exchange of
   the E-VPN Inclusive Multicast route, as defined in [E-VPN]. 

   To support multicast/broadcast from Leaf to Root sites, ingress
   replication should be sufficient for most scenarios where there is a
   single Root or few Roots. If the number of Roots is large, a P2MP
   tree rooted at the PEs with Leaf sites may be used.

3.2 E-Tree without MAC Learning

   The PEs implementing an E-Tree service need not perform MAC learning
   when the traffic flows between Root and Leaf sites are multicast or
   broadcast. In this case, the PEs do not exchange E-VPN MAC
   Advertisement routes. Instead, the Ethernet A-D routes are used to
   exchange the E-VPN labels. 

   The fields of the Ethernet A-D route are populated per the procedures
