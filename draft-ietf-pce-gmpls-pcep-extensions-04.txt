Internet-Draft             PCEP Ext for GMPLS               October 2011


1.  Introduction

   PCEP RFCs [RFC5440], [RFC5521], [RFC5541], [RFC5520] are focused on
   path computation requests in MPLS networks.  [RFC4655] defines the
   PCE framework also for GMPLS networks.  This document complements
   these RFCs by providing some consideration of GMPLS applications and
   routing requests, for example for OTN and WSON networks.

   The requirements on PCE extensions to support those characteristics
   are described in [I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-aps-req] and
   [I-D.ietf-pce-wson-routing-wavelength].

1.2.  PCEP requirements for GMPLS

   This section provides a set of PCEP requirements to support GMPLS
   LSPs and assure signal compatibility in the path.  When requesting a
   path computation (PCReq) to PCE, the PCC should be able to indicate,
   according to [I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-aps-req] and to RSVP procedures like
   explicit label control (ELC), the following additional attributes:

      (1) Switching capability: for instance PSC1-4, L2SC, TDM, LSC, FSC

      (2) Encoding type: as defined in [RFC4202], [RFC4203], e.g.,
      Ethernet, SONET/SDH, Lambda, etc.

      (3) Signal Type: Indicates the type of elementary signal that
      constitutes the requested LSP.  A lot of signal types with
      different granularity have been defined in SONET/SDH and G.709
      ODUk, such as VC11, VC12, VC2, VC3 and VC4 in SDH, and ODU1, ODU2
      and ODU3 in G.709 ODUk [RFC4606], [RFC4328] and other signal types
      like the one defined in [I-D.ceccarelli-ccamp-gmpls-ospf-g709] or
      [I-D.zhang-ccamp-gmpls-evolving-g709] .

      (4) Concatenation Type: In SDH/SONET and G.709 OTN networks, two
      kinds of concatenation modes are defined: contiguous concatenation
      which requires co-route for each member signal and requires all
      the interfaces along the path to support this capability, and
      virtual concatenation which allows diverse routes for the member
      signals and only requires the ingress and egress interfaces to
      support this capability.  Note that for the virtual concatenation,
      it also may specify co-routed or separated-routed.  See [RFC4606]

Internet-Draft             PCEP Ext for GMPLS               October 2011


      and [RFC4328] about concatenation information.

      (5) Concatenation Number: Indicates the number of signals that are
      requested to be contiguously or virtually concatenated.  See also
      [RFC4606] and [RFC4328].

      (6) Technology specific label(s) such as wavelength label as
      defined in [RFC6205]

      (7) e2e Path protection type: as defined in [RFC4872], e.g., 1+1
      protection, 1:1 protection, (pre-planned) rerouting, etc.

      (8) Link Protection type: as defined in [RFC4203]

      (9) Support for unnumbered interfaces: as defined in [RFC3477]

      (10) Support for asymmetric bandwidth requests.

      (11) Ability to indicate the requested granularity for the path
      ERO: node, link, label.  This is to allow the use of the explicit
      label control of RSVP.

      (12) In order to support the label control the Path computation
      response should provide label information matching signaling
      capabilities

      (13) The PCC should be able to provide label restrictions similar
      to RSVP on the requests.

   We describe in this document a proposal to fulfill those
   requirements.

1.3.  PCEP existing objects related to GMPLS

   PCEP as of [RFC5440], [RFC5521] and [I-D.ietf-pce-inter-layer-ext],
   supports the following information (in the PCReq and PCRep) related
   to the described requirements.

   From [RFC5440]:

   o  numbered endpoints

   o  bandwidth (encoded as IEEE float)

   o  ERO

   o  LSP attributes (setup and holding priorities)




Margaria, et al.           Expires May 2, 2012                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             PCEP Ext for GMPLS               October 2011


   o  Request attribute (include some LSP attributes)

   From [RFC5521],Extensions to PCEP for Route Exclusions, definition of
   a XRO object and a new semantic (F bit):

   o  This object also allows to exclude (strict or not) resources; XRO
      include the diversity level (node, link, SRLG).  The requested
      diversity is expressed in the XRO

   o  This Object with the F bit set indicates that the existing route
      is failed and resources present in the RRO can be reused.

   From [I-D.ietf-pce-inter-layer-ext]:

   o  INTER-LAYER : indicates if inter-layer computation is allowed

   o  SWITCH-LAYER : indicates which layer(s) should be considered, can
      be used to represent the RSVP-TE generalized label request

   o  REQ-ADAP-CAP : indicates the adaptation capabilities requested,
      can also be used for the endpoints in case of mono-layer
      computation

   The shortcomings of the existing PCEP information are:

      The BANDWIDTH and LOAD-BALANCING objects do not describe the
      details of the traffic request (for example NVC, multiplier) in
      the context of GMPLS networks, for instance TDM or OTN networks.

      The END-POINTS object does not allow specifying an unnumbered
      interface, nor the labels on the interface.  Those parameters are
      of interest in case of switching constraints.

   Current attributes do not allow to express the requested link level
   protection and end-to-end protection attributes.

   The covered PCEP extensions are:

      New objects are introduced (GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH and GENERALIZED-
      LOAD-BALANCING) for flexible bandwidth encoding,

      New Objects are introduced (LABEL-SET and SUGGESTED-LABEL-SET) on
      order to allow the PCC to restrict/influence the range of labels
      returned

      A new object type is introduced for the END-POINTS object
      (generalized-endpoint),

      A new TLV is added to the LSPA object.

      In order to indicate the mandatory routing granularity in the
      response, a new flag in the RP object is added.

1.4.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  PCEP objects and extensions

   This section describes the required PCEP objects and extensions.  The
   PCReq and PCRep messages are defined in [RFC5440].  The format of the
   request and response messages with the proposed extensions
   (GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH, GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING, SUGGESTED-LABEL-
   SET and LABEL-SET) is as follows:

     <request>::= <RP>
                  <segment-computation>|<path-key-expansion>

     <segment-computation> ::=
       <END-POINTS>
       [<LSPA>]
       [<BANDWIDTH>]
       [<GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH>...]
       [<metric-list>]
       [<OF>]
       [<RRO> [<BANDWIDTH>] [<GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH>...]]
       [<IRO>]
       [<SUGGESTED-LABEL-SET>]
       [<LABEL-SET>...]
       [<LOAD-BALANCING>]
       [<GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING>...]
       [<XRO>]

     <path-key-expansion> ::= <PATH-KEY>

     <response>::=<RP>
       [<NO-PATH>]
       [<attribute-list>]
       [<path-list>]

     <path-list>::=<path>[<path-list>]
     <path>::= <ERO><attribute-list>
     <metric-list>::=<METRIC>[<metric-list>]


   Where:

      <attribute-list>::=[<LSPA>]
      [<BANDWIDTH>]
      [<LABEL-SET>...]
      [<SUGGESTED-LABEL-SET>...]
      [<GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH>...]
      [<GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING>...]
      [<metric-list>]
      [<IRO>]

Internet-Draft             PCEP Ext for GMPLS               October 2011


   For point-to-multipoint(P2MP) computations, the proposed grammar is:

    <segment-computation> ::=
        <end-point-rro-pair-list>
        [<LSPA>]
        [<BANDWIDTH>]
        [<GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH>...]
        [<metric-list>]
        [<IRO>]
        [<SUGGESTED-LABEL-SET>]
        [<LABEL-SET>]
        [<LOAD-BALANCING>]
        [<GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING>...]
        [<XRO>]

     <end-point-rro-pair-list>::=
              <END-POINTS>[<RRO-List>][<BANDWIDTH>]
             [<GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH>...]
             [<end-point-rro-pair-list>]

     <RRO-List>::=<RRO>[<BANDWIDTH>]
     [< GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH>...][<RRO-List>]

2.1.  RP object extension

   Explicit label control (ELC) is a procedure supported by RSVP-TE,
   where the outgoing label(s) is(are) encoded in the ERO.  In
   consequence, the PCE may be able to provide such label(s) directly in
   the path ERO.  The PCC, depending on policies or switching layer, may
   be required to use explicit label control or expect explicit link,
   thus it need to indicate in the PCReq which granularity it is
   expecting in the ERO.  This correspond to requirement 11 of
   [I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-aps-req] The possible granularities can be node,
   link, label.  The granularities are inter-dependent, in the sense
   that link granularity imply the presence of node information in the
   ERO, similarly a label granularity imply that the ERO contain node,
   link and label information.

   A new 2-bit routing granularity (RG) flag is defined in the RP
   object.  The values are defined as follows











Margaria, et al.           Expires May 2, 2012                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft             PCEP Ext for GMPLS               October 2011



                               0 : node

                               1 : link

                               2 : label

                               3 : reserved

   When the RP object appears in a request within a PCReq message the
   flag indicates the requested route granularity.  The PCE MAY try to
   follow this granularity and MAY return a NO-PATH if the requested
   granularity cannot be provided.  The PCE MAY return more details on
   the route based on its policy.  The PCC can decide if the ERO is
   acceptable based on its content.

   If a PCE did use the requested routing granularity in a PCReq is MUST
   indicate the routing granularity in the PCRep.  The RG flag is
   backward-compatible with previous RFCs: the value sent by an
   implementation not supporting it will indicate a node granularity.
   This flag is optional for responses.  A new capability flag in the
   PCE-CAP-FLAGS from [RFC5088] and [RFC5089] may be added.

2.2.  Traffic parameters encoding, GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH

   The PCEP BANDWIDTH does not describe the details of the signal (for
   example NVC, multiplier), hence the bandwidth information should be
   extended to use the RSVP Tspec object encoding.  The PCEP BANDWIDTH
   object defines two types: 1 and 2.  C-Type 2 is representing the
   existing bandwidth in case of re-optimization.

   The following possibilities cannot be represented in the BANDWIDTH
   object:

   o  Asymmetric bandwidth (different bandwidth in forward and reverse
      direction), as described in [RFC6387]

   o  GMPLS (SDH/SONET, G.709, ATM, MEF etc) parameters are not
      supported.

   This correspond to requirement 3,4,5 and 10 of
   [I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-aps-req].

   According to [RFC5440] the BANDWIDTH object has no TLV and has a
   fixed size of 4 bytes.  This definition does not allow extending it
   with the required information.  To express this information, a new
   object named GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH having the following format is
   defined:

   The GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH has a variable length.  The Traffic spec
   length field indicates the length of the Traffic spec field.  The
   bits R and O have the following meaning:

      O bit : when set the value refers to the previous bandwidth in
      case of re-optimization

      R bit : when set the value refers to the bandwidth of the reverse
      direction

   The Object type determines which type of bandwidth is represented by
   the object.  The following object types are defined:

   1.  Intserv

   2.  SONET/SDH

   3.  G.709

   4.  Ethernet

   The encoding of the field Traffic Spec is the same as in RSVP-TE, it
   can be found in the following references.

   The GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH MAY appear more than once in a PCReq
   message.  If more than one GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH have the same Object
   Type, Reserved, R and O values, only the first one is processed, the
   others are ignored.

   a PCE MAY ignore GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH objects, a PCC that requires a
   GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH to be used can set the P (Processing) bit in
   the object header.

   When a PCC needs to get a bi-directional path with asymmetric
   bandwidth, it SHOULD specify the different bandwidth in forward and
   reverse directions through two separate GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH
   objects.  If the PCC set the P bit on both object the PCE MUST
   compute a path that satisfies the asymmetric bandwidth constraint and
   return the path to PCC if the path computation is successful.  If the
   P bit on the reverse GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH object the PCE MAY ignore
   this constraint.

   a PCE MAY include the GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH objects in the response
   to indicate the GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH of the path

   Optional TLVs may be included within the object body to specify more
   specific bandwidth requirements.  The specification of such TLVs is
   outside the scope of this document.

2.3.  Traffic parameters encoding, GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING

   The LOAD-BALANCING object is used to request a set of maximum Max-LSP
   TE-LSP having in total the bandwidth specified in BANDWIDTH, each TE-
   LSP having a minimum of min-bandwidth bandwidth.  The LOAD-BALANCING

   follows the bandwidth encoding of the BANDWIDTH object, it does not
   describe enough details for the traffic specification expected by
   GMPLS.  A PCC should be allowed to request a set of TE-LSP also in
   case of GMPLS traffic specification.

   According to [RFC5440] the LOAD-BALANCING object has no TLV and has a
   fixed size of 8 bytes.  This definition does not allows extending it
   with the required information.  To express this information, a new
   Object named GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING is defined.

   The GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING object, as the LOAD-BALANCING object,
   allows the PCC to request a set of TE-LSP having in total the
   GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH traffic specification with potentially Max-Lsp,
   each TE-LSP having a minimum of Min Traffic spec.  The GENERALIZED-
   LOAD-BALANCING is optional.

   GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING Object-Class is to be assigned by IANA.
   The GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING Object type determines which type of
   minimum bandwidth is represented by the object.  The following object
   types are defined:

   1.  Intserv

   2.  SONET/SDH

   3.  G.709

   4.  Ethernet

   The GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING has a variable length.

   The format of the GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING object body is as
   follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3

   Traffic spec length (16 bits): the total length of the min traffic
   specification.  It should be noted that the RSVP traffic

   specification may also include TLV different than the PCEP TLVs.

   Flags (8 bits): The undefined Flags field MUST be set to zero on
   transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.  The following flag is
   defined:

      R Flag : (1 bit) set when the value refer to the bandwidth of the
      reverse direction

   Max-LSP (8 bits): maximum number of TE LSPs in the set.

   Min-Traffic spec (variable): Specifies the minimum traffic spec of
   each element of the set of TE LSPs.

   The encoding of the field Traffic Spec is the same as in RSVP-TE, it
   can be found in the following references.

   The GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING MAY appear more than once in a PCReq
   message.  If more than one GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING have the same
   Object Type, and R Flag, only the first one is processed, the others
   are ignored.

   a PCE MAY ignore GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING objects.  A PCC that
   requires a GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING to be used can set the P
   (Processing) bit in the object header.

   When a PCC needs to get a bi-directional path with asymmetric
   bandwidth, it SHOULD specify the different bandwidth in forward and
   reverse directions through two separate GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING
   objects with different R Flag.  If the PCC set the P bit on both
   object the PCE MUST compute a path that satisfies the asymmetric
   bandwidth constraint and return the path to PCC if the path
   computation is successful.  If the P bit on the reverse GENERALIZED-
   LOAD-BALANCING object the PCE MAY ignore this constraint.

   Optional TLVs may be included within the object body to specify more

   specific bandwidth requirements.  The specification of such TLVs is
   outside the scope of this document.

   The GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING object has the same semantic as the
   LOAD-BALANCING object; If a PCC requests the computation of a set of
   TE LSPs so that the total of their generalized bandwidth is X, the
   maximum number of TE LSPs is N, and each TE LSP must at least have a
   bandwidth of B, it inserts a GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH object specifying
   X as the required bandwidth and a GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING object
   with the Max-LSP and Min-traffic spec fields set to N and B,
   respectively.

   For example a request for one co-signaled n x VC-4 TE-LSP will not
   use the GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING.  In case the V4 components can
   use different paths, the GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH will contain a traffic
   specification indicating the complete n x VC4 traffic specification
   and the GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING the minimum co-signaled VC4.  For
   a SDH network, a request to have a TE-LSP group with 10 VC4
   container, each path using at minimum 2VC4 container, can be
   represented with a GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH object with OT=4, the
   content of the Traffic specification is ST=6,RCC=0,NCC=0,NVC=10,MT=1.
   The GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING, OT=4,R=0,Max-LSP=5, min Traffic spec
   is (ST=6,RCC=0,NCC=0,NVC=2,MT=1).  The PCE can respond with a
   response with maximum 5 path, each of then having a GENERALIZED-
   BANDWIDTH OT=4,R=0, and traffic spec matching the minimum traffic
   spec from the GENERALIZED-LOAD-BALANCING object of the corresponding
   request.

2.4.  END-POINTS Object extensions

   The END-POINTS object is used in a PCReq message to specify the
   source and destination of the path for which a path computation is
   requested.  From [RFC3471] the source IP address and the destination
   IP address are used to identify those.  A new Object Type is defined
   to address the following possibilities:

   o  Different endpoint types.

   o  Label restrictions on the endpoint.

   o  Specification of unnumbered endpoints type as seen in GMPLS
      networks.

   The Object encoding is described in the following sections.

2.4.1.  Generalized Endpoint Object Type

   In GMPLS context the endpoints can:

   o  Be unnumbered

   o  Have label(s) associated to them

   o  May have different switching capabilities

   The IPv4 and IPv6 endpoints are used to represent the source and
   destination IP addresses.  The scope of the IP address (Node or Link)
   is not explicitly stated.  It should also be possible to request a
   Path between a numbered link and an unnumbered link, or a P2MP path
   between different type of endpoints.

   Since the PCEP END-POINTS object only support endpoints of the same
   type a new C-Type is proposed that support different endpoint types,
   including unnumbered.  This new C-Type also supports the
   specification of constraints on the endpoint label to be use.  The
   PCE might know the interface restrictions but this is not a
   requirement.  On the path calculation request only the Tspec and
   switch layer need to be coherent, the endpoint labels could be
   different (supporting a different Tspec).  Hence the label
   restrictions include a Generalized label request in order to
   interpret the labels.  This correspond to requirement 6 and 9 of
   [I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-aps-req].

   The proposed object format consists of a body and a list of TLVs,
   which give the details of the endpoints and are described in
   Section 2.4.2.  For each endpoint type, a different grammar is
   defined.  The TLVs defined to describe an endpoint are:

   1.  IPv4 address.

   2.  IPv6 address.

   3.  Unnumbered endpoint.

   4.  Label request.

   5.  Label.

   6.  Upstream label.

   7.  Label set.

   8.  Suggested label set.

   The labels TLV are used to restrict the label allocation in the PCE.
   They follow the set of restrictions provided by signaling with
   explicit value (label and upstream label), mandatory range
   restrictions (Label set) and optional range restriction (suggested
   label set).  Single suggested value is using the suggested label set.
   The label range restriction are valid in GMPLS networks, either by
   PCC policy or depending on the switching technology used, for
   instance on given Ethernet or ODU equipment having limited hardware
   capabilities restricting the label range.  Label set restriction also
   applies to WSON networks where the optical sender and receivers are
   limited in their frequency tunability ranges, restricting then in
   GMPLS the possible label ranges on the interface.  The END-POINTS
   Object with Generalized Endpoint object type is encoded as follow:

       0                   1                   2                   3

      ~                           TLVs                                ~
      |                                                               |

   5-244   Reserved

   245-255 Experimental range

   The endpoint type is used to cover both point-to-point and different
   point-to-multipoint endpoint semantic.  Endpoint type 0 MAY be
   accepted by the PCE, other endpoint type MAY be supported if the PCE
   implementation supports P2MP path calculation.  A PCE not supporting
   a given endpoint type MUST respond with a PCErr with error code "Path
   computation failure", error type "Unsupported endpoint type in END-
   POINTS Generalized Endpoint object type".  The TLVs present in the
   object body MUST follow the following grammar:

     <generalized-endpoint-tlvs>::=
       <p2p-endpoints> | <p2mp-endpoints>

     <p2p-endpoints> ::=
       <source-endpoint>
       <destination-endpoint>

     <source-endpoint> ::=
       <endpoint>

     <p2mp-endpoints> ::=
       <endpoint> [<endpoint-restriction-list>]
       [<endpoint> [<endpoint-restriction-list>]]...

   present in the message and represent a leave, exact meaning depend on
   the endpoint type defined of the object.

   An endpoint is defined as follows:

    <endpoint>::=<IPV4-ADDRESS>|<IPV6-ADDRESS>|<UNNUMBERED-ENDPOINT>
    <endpoint-restriction-list> ::=
                 <endpoint-restriction>
                 [<endpoint-restriction-list>]

    <endpoint-restriction> ::=
                     <LABEL-REQUEST><label-restriction-list>

    <label-restriction-list> ::= <label-restriction>
                                 [<label-restriction-list>]
    <label-restriction> ::= <LABEL>|<UPSTREAM-LABEL>|
                             <LABEL-SET>|
                             <SUGGESTED-LABEL-SET>

   The different TLVs are described in the following sections.  A PCE
   MAY support IPV4-ADDRESS,IPV6-ADDRESS or UNNUMBERED-ENDPOINT TLV.  A
   PCE not supporting one of those TLV in a PCReq MUST respond with a
   PCRep with NO-PATH with the bit "Unknown destination" or "Unknown
   source" in the NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV, the PCRep MUST include the
   ENDPOINT object in the response with only the TLV it did not
   understood.

   A PCE MAY support LABEL-REQUEST, LABEL, UPSTREAM-LABEL, LABEL-SET or
   SUGGESTED-LABEL-SET TLV.  For non supported TLV in the END-POINTS a
   PCE MUST respond with a PCErr message with error type="Path
   computation failure" error value="Unsupported TLV present in END-
   POINTS Generalized Endpoint object type" and the message MUST include
   the ENDPOINT object in the response with only the endpoint and
   endpoint restriction TLV it did not understood.  A PCE not supporting
   being able to fulfill the label restriction MUST respond with a PCRep
   with NO-PATH with the bit "No endpoint label resource" or "No
   endpoint label resource in range" in the NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV, the
   PCRep MUST include the ENDPOINT object in the response with only the
   TLV where it could not met the the constraint.

2.4.2.4.  LABEL-REQUEST TLV

   The LABEL-REQUEST TLV indicates the switching capability and encoding
   type of the label restriction list.  Its format is the same as
   described in [RFC3471] Section 3.1 Generalized label request.  The
   LABEL-REQUEST TLV use TLV-Type=TBA.  The fields are encoded as in the
   RSVP-TE.  The Encoding Type indicates the encoding type, e.g., SONET/
   SDH/GigE etc., that will be used with the data associated with the
   LSP.  The Switching type indicates the type of switching that is
   being requested on the link.  G-PID identifies the payload of the TE-
   LSP.  This TLV and the following one are introduced to satisfy
   requirement 13 for the endpoint.

   This TLV MAY be ignored, in which case a PCRep with NO-PATH should be
   responded, as described in Section 2.4.1.

2.4.2.5.  Labels TLV

   Label or label range restrictions may be specified for the TE-LSP
   endpoints.  Those are encoded in the TLVs.  The label value need to
   be interpreted with a description on the Encoding and switching type.
   The REQ-ADAP-CAP object from [I-D.ietf-pce-inter-layer-ext] can be
   used in case of mono-layer request, however in case of multilayer it
   is possible to have in the future more than one object, so it is
   better to have a dedicated TLV for the label and label request (the
   scope is then more clear).  Those TLV MAY be ignored, in which case a
   PCRep with NO-PATH should be responded, as described in
   Section 2.4.1.  TLVs are encoded as follow (following [RFC5440]) :

   o  LABEL TLV, Type=TBA.  The TLV Length is variable, the value is the
      same as [RFC3471] Section 3.2 Generalized label.  This represent
      the downstream label

   o  UPSTREAM-LABEL TLV, Type=TBA, The TLV Length is variable, the
      value is the same as [RFC3471] Section 3.2 Generalized label.
      This represent the upstream label

   o  LABEL-SET TLV, Type=TBA.  The TLV Length is variable, Encoding
      follow [RFC3471] Section 3.5 "Label set" with the addition of a U
      bit : the U bit is set for upstream direction in case of
      bidirectional LSP.

   o  SUGGESTED-LABEL-SET TLV Set, Type=TBA.  The TLV length is
      variable, Encoding is as LABEL-SET TLV.

   A LABEL TLV represent the label used on the unnumbered interface, bit
   U is used to indicate which exact direction is considered.  The label
   type indicates which type of label is carried.  A LABEL-SET TLV
   represents a set of possible labels that can be used on the
   unnumbered interface. the label allocated on the first link SHOULD be
   within the label set range.  The action parameter in the Label set
   indicates the type of list provided.  Those parameters are described
   by [RFC3471] section 3.5.1 A SUGGESTED-LABEL-SET TLV has the same
   encoding as the LABEL-SET TLV, it indicates to the PCE a set of
   preferred (ordered) set of labels to be used. the PCE MAY use those
   labels for label allocation.

   The U bit has the following meaning:


   U: Upstream direction: set when the label or label set is in the
      reverse direction

2.5.  LABEL-SET object

   The LABEL-SET object is carried in a request within a PCReq message
   to restrict the set of labels to be assigned during the path
   computation.  This is introduced to satisfy requirement 13.

   When the P bit is set and the object accepted any label allocated by
   the PCE (and included in the ERO object on the response) MUST be in
   the range stated in the LABEL-SET.  When no path satisfy this
   constraint a PCRep with a NO-PATH should be responded wit a NO-PATH-
   VECTOR TLV with the bit "No label resource in range" set and the

   LABEL-SET object MAY be included to indicate the set of constraint
   that could not be satisfied.

   When the P bit is not set a PCE MAY consider constraint, the PCC can
   verify that the constraint was applied by checking the ERO returned

   The LABEL-SET Object encoding is defined as following

     0                   1                   2                   3

    //                   TLVs                                      //
    |                                                               |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   where TLVs follow the following grammar

   <label-set-tlvs> ::= <LABEL-REQUEST><LABEL-SET>[<LABEL-SET>]

   The LABEL-REQUEST and LABEL-SET TLVs are as defined in
   Section 2.4.2.5, See also [RFC3471] and [RFC3473] for the definitions
   of the fields.

   It is allowed to have more than one LABEL-SET object per request
   within a PCReq message (for example in case of multiple SWITCH-LAYER
   present).

2.6.  SUGGESTED-LABEL-SET object

   Similar to the endpoint restriction SUGGESTED-LABEL-SET TLV, but with
   end-to-end scope the SUGGESTED-LABEL-SET object indicate an optional
   set of label that the PCE MAY use when selecting the labels.  The
   SUGGESTED-LABEL-SET object is carried within a PCReq or PCRep message
   to indicate the preferred set of label to be assigned during the path
   computation.  The encoding is the same as the LABEL-SET object.  It
   is allowed to have more than one SUGGESTED LABEL-SET object per PCReq
   (for example in case of multiple SWITCH-LAYER present).

   This object is introduced similarly to the LABEl-SET to satisfy the
   requirement 6 and 13, more specifically the ability to indicate
   optional preference for the label selection support by RSVP using the
   SUGGESTED_LABEL.

2.7.  LSPA extensions

   The LSPA carries the LSP attributes.  In the end-to-end protection
   context this also includes the protection state information.  This

   object is introduced to fulfill requirement 7 and is used as a policy
   input for route and label selection.  The LSPA object can be extended
   by a protection TLV type: Type TBA: PROTECTION-ATTRIBUTE

      0                   1                   2                   3

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The content is as defined in [RFC4872], [RFC4873].

   LSP Flags can be considered for routing policy based on the
   protection type.  The other attributes are only meaningful for a
   s_ateful PCE.

   This TLV is optional and MAY be ignored by the PCE, in which case
   MUST NOT include the TLV in the LSPA, if present, of the PCRep.  When
   the TLV is used by the PCE, a LSPA object and the PROTECTION-
   ATTRIBUTE TLV MUST be included in the PCRep.  Fields that were not
   considered MUST be set to 0.

2.8.  NO-PATH Object Extension

   The NO-PATH object is used in PCRep messages in response to an
   unsuccessful path computation request (the PCE could not find a path
   satisfying the set of constraints).  In this scenario, PCE MUST
   include a NO-PATH object in the PCRep message.  The NO-PATH object
   may carries the NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV that specifies more information on
   the reasons that led to a negative reply.  In case of GMPLS networks
   there could be some more additional constraints that led to the
   failure like protection mismatch, lack of resources, and so on.  Few
   new flags have been introduced in the 32-bit flag field of the NO-
   PATH-VECTOR TLV and no modifications have been made in the NO-PATH
   object.

2.8.1.  Extensions to NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV

   The modified NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV carrying the additional information
   is as follows:

      Bit number TBA - Protection Mismatch (1-bit).  Specifies the
      mismatch of the protection type in the PROTECTION-ATTRIBUTE TLV in
      the request.

      Bit number TBA - No Resource (1-bit).  Specifies that the
      resources are not currently sufficient to provide the path.

      Bit number TBA - Granularity not supported (1-bit).  Specifies
      that the PCE is not able to provide a route with the requested
      granularity.

      Bit number TBA - No endpoint label resource (1-bit).  Specifies
      that the PCE is not able to provide a route because of the
      endpoint label restriction.

      Bit number TBA - No endpoint label resource in range (1-bit).
      Specifies that the PCE is not able to provide a route because of
      the endpoint label set restriction.

      Bit number TBA - No label resource in range (1-bit).  Specifies
      that the PCE is not able to provide a route because of the label
      set restriction.

3.  Additional Error Type and Error Values Defined

   A PCEP-ERROR object is used to report a PCEP error and is
   characterized by an Error-Type that specifies the type of error while
   Error-value that provides additional information about the error
   type.  An additional error type and few error values are defined to
   represent some of the errors related to the newly identified objects
   related to SDH networks.  For each PCEP error, an Error-Type and an
   Error-value are defined.  Error-Type 1 to 10 are already defined in
   [RFC5440].  Additional Error- values are defined for Error-Type 10
   and A new Error-Type is introduced (value TBA).

   Liveness Detection and Monitoring This document makes no change to
   the basic operation of PCEP and so there are no changes to the

5.6.  New  NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV Fields

   As described in Section Section 2.8.1, new NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV Flag
   Fields have been defined.  IANA is requested to do the following
   allocations in the "NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV Flag Field" sub-registry.  The
   values here are suggested for use by IANA.

      Bit number 23 - Protection Mismatch (1-bit).  Specifies the
      mismatch of the protection type of the PROTECTION-ATTRIBUTE TLV in
      the request.

      Bit number 22 - No Resource (1-bit).  Specifies that the resources
      are not currently sufficient to provide the path.

      Bit number 21 - Granularity not supported (1-bit).  Specifies that
      the PCE is not able to provide a route with the requested
      granularity.

      Bit number 20 - No endpoint label resource (1-bit).  Specifies
      that the PCE is not able to provide a route because of the
      endpoint label restriction.

      Bit number 19 - No endpoint label resource in range (1-bit).
      Specifies that the PCE is not able to provide a route because of
      the endpoint label set restriction.

      Bit number 18 - No label resource in range (1-bit).  Specifies
      that the PCE is not able to provide a route because of the label
      set restriction.

      Bit number 17 - Not supported endpoint restriction (1-bit).
      Specifies that the PCE is not able to provide a route because of a
      not supported endpoint restriction.
