                    CoAP option for no server-response
                   draft-tcs-coap-no-response-option-04


   Abstract

   There can be typical M2M scenarios where responses from the data
   sink to the data source against request/ notification from the
   source might be considered redundant. This kind of open-loop
   exchange (with no reverse path from the sink to the source) may be
   desired while updating resources in constrained systems looking for
   maximized throughput with minimized resource consumption. CoAP
   already provides a non-confirmable (NON) mode of exchange where The
   receiving end-point does not respond with ACK. However, the
   receiving end-point responds the sender with a status code
   indicating "the result of the attempt to understand and satisfy the
   request".

   This draft introduces a header option: 'No-Response' to suppress
   responses from the receiver and discusses exemplary use cases which
   motivated this proposition based on real experience. This option
   also provides granularity by allowing suppression of a typical class
   or a combination of classes of responses. This option may be
   effective for both unicast and multicast scenarios.

1. Introduction

   This draft proposes a new header option 'No-Response' for
   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). This option enables the
   sender end-point to explicitly express its disinterest in getting
   responses back from the receiving end-point. By default this option
   expresses disinterest in any kind of response. This option should be
   applicable along with non-confirmable (NON) updates. At present this
   option will have no effect if used with confirmable (CON) mode.

   Along with the technical details this draft presents some practical
   application scenarios which should bring out the utility of this
   option.

1.1. Granular suppression of responses

   This option enables granularity by allowing the sender to choose the
   typical class or combination of classes of responses which it is
   disinterested in. For example, a sender may explicitly tell the
   receiver that no response is required unless something 'bad' happens
   and a response of class 4.xx or 5.xx is to be fed back to the
   sender. No response is required in case of 2.xx classes. A similar
   scheme is described in Section 3.7 of [I-D.ietf-core-groupcomm] on
   the server side. Here the server may perform granular suppression
   for group communication. But in this case the server itself decides
   whether to suppress responses or not. This option enables the
   clients to explicitly inform the server about the disinterest in
   responses.

1.2. Terminology

   The terms used in this draft are in conformance with those defined
   in [I-D.ietf-core-coap].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119.

2. Potential benefits

   If this option is opportunistically used with fitting M2M
   applications then the concerned systems may benefit in the following
   aspects:

       * Reduction in network clogging

       * Reduction in server-side loading

       * Reduction in battery consumption at the constrained end-point

       * Reduction in communication cost at the constrained end-point

       * May help to satisfy hard real-time requirements (since,
          waiting due to closed loop latency is completely avoided)

3. Exemplary application scenarios

   The described scenarios are confined within a communication pattern
   where there is a direct communication channel between a constrained
   device (the device may well be a constrained gateway) and an
   unconstrained backend. Also, we consider only the scenario of data
   updates which happen through a push to the server by the client
   using PUT or POST.

   The application scenarios are classified into 2 categories as below:

   Category 1) Data-source=constrained device; Data-sink=backend.

   Category 2) Data-source=backend; Data-sink=constrained device.

   Next sub-section describes the user stories and the potential
   benefits in each of the cases through the use of No-Response option.
   An Intelligent Traffic System (ITS) is considered as the base
   application. The application scenarios are formed out of the
   different aspects of ITS.

3.1. Frequent update of geo-location from vehicles to backend (Category
   1)

   Each vehicle in ITS is equipped with a sensor-gateway comprising
   sensors like GPS and Accelerometer. The sensor-gateway connects to
   the Internet using a low-bandwidth cellular (e.g. GPRS) connection.
   The GPS co-ordinates are periodically updated to the backend server
   by the gateway. In case of ITS the update rate is adaptive to the
   motional-state of the vehicle. If the vehicle moves fast the update
   rate is high as the position of the vehicle changes rapidly. If the
   vehicle is static or moves slowly then the update rate is low. This
   ensures that bandwidth and energy is not consumed unnecessarily. The
   motional-state of the vehicle is inferred by a local analytics
   running on the sensor-gateway which uses the accelerometer data and
   the rate of change in GPS co-ordinates. The back-end server hosts
   applications which use the updates for each vehicle and produce
   necessary information for remote users.

   Retransmitting a location co-ordinate which is already passed by a
   vehicle is not efficient as it adds redundant traffic to the
   network. So, the updates are done in NON mode. However, given the
   thousands of vehicles updating frequently, the NON exchange will
   also trigger huge number of status responses from the backend. Each
   response in the air is of 4 bytes of application layer plus several
   bytes originating from the lower layers. Thus the cumulative load on
   the network will be quite significant.

   On the contrary, if the edge devices explicitly declare that they do
   not need any status response then significant load will be reduced
   from the network and the server as well. The assumption is that
   since the update rate is high stray losses in geo-locations will be
   compensated with the large update rate and thereby not affecting the
   end applications.

3.1.1. Benefits using No-Response

   Thus mapping the above scenario to the benefits mentioned in section
   2 reveals that use of 'No-Response' will help in:

       * Reduction in network clogging

       * Reduction in server-side loading

       * Help in achieving real-time requirements as the application is
          not bound by any delay due to closed loop latency

3.2. Multicasting traffic congestion information to PDAs/ smart-phones
   (Category 2)

   The ITS might have an application which runs some analytics at the
   backend and determines the instantaneous traffic congestion spots in
   a city. The analytics is done based on the real-time geo-location
   updates received from the vehicles registered in the system. The
   backend application multicasts the instantaneous results of the
   analytics to the constrained handheld devices which registered to
   the city authority for real-time updates on congestion points. The
   backend is not really interested in the delivery status of these
   updates. In this case the backend uses No-Response option along with
   NON updates to reduce the traffic generated due to simultaneous
   status responses from hundreds of subscribed handheld devices.

3.2.1. Using granular response suppression

   However, an intelligent application may use the granularity feature
   of this option such that the responses are fed-back to the backend
   when updates to particular devices cause errors. So the updates may
   contain 'No-Response' option indicating that a response is to be
   suppressed only in success conditions and all responses in case of
   errors should be fed back. The server might eventually stop sending
   updates to the devices which responded with consecutive 'bad'
   responses. This will indirectly help saving network bandwidth.

3.2.2. Benefits using No-Response

   Thus mapping the above scenario to the benefits mentioned in section
   2 reveals that use of 'No-Response' will help in:

       * Reduction in network clogging

       * Reduction in battery consumption at the constrained end-point

       * Reduction in communication cost at the constrained end-point

4. Option Definition

   The properties of this option are as in Table 1.

   This option is Elective and Non-Repeatable. If a proxy happens to
   encounter this option it should not forward. Hence caching is not
   applicable. The assumption here is that if an application needs a
   proxy in between an unconstrained backend and a constrained node
   then in most cases the leg between the constrained node and the
   proxy will be constrained in nature. So by restricting this option
   up to the proxy we can reap the benefits of this option in
   constrained environment without increasing overall complexity.

   This option is presently intended for update requests (e.g., PUT) in
   NON mode and should have no effect if used with a CON request. This
   option contains values to indicate interest/ disinterest in all or a
   particular class or combination of classes of responses as described
   in the next sub-section.

   The following table provides a 'ready-reckoner' on possible
   applicability of this option for all the four REST methods. This
   table is prepared in view of the type of application scenarios
   foreseen so far.

   +-------------+----------------------------------------------------+
   | Method Name |              Remarks on applicability              |
   +-------------+----------------------------------------------------+
   |     GET     |                   Not applicable.                  |
   +-------------+----------------------------------------------------+
   |             | Applicable for frequent updates in NON mode on     |
   |     PUT     | existing fixed resources. Might not be useful when |
   |             | PUT 'creates' a new resource.                      |
   +-------------+----------------------------------------------------+
   |             | If POST is used just to update a target resource   |
   |             | then No-Response can be used in the same manner as |
   |             | in NON-PUT. May also be applicable when POST       |
   |             | performs resource creation and the client does not |
   |             | refer to the resource in future. For example, than |
   |             | updating a fixed resource, POST API may rather     |
   |    POST     | contain a query-string with name/value pairs for a |
   |             | defined action (ex. insertion into a database as   |
   |             | part of frequent updates). The resources created   |
   |             | this way may be 'short-lived' resources which the  |
   |             | client will not refer to in future (see section    |
   |             | 5.1.2.2).                                          |
   +-------------+----------------------------------------------------+
   |             | Not applicable. Deletion is usually a permanent    |
   |    DELETE   | action and the client should make sure that the    |
   |             | deletion actually happened.                        |

4.1. Achieving granular suppression

   This option is defined as a bit-map (Table 3) to achieve granular
   suppression.

   +-------+-----------------------+---------------------------------+
   | Value | Binary Representation |          Description            |
   +-------+-----------------------+---------------------------------+
   |   0   |      00000000         | Suppress all responses (same as |
   |       |                       | empty value).                   |
   +-------+-----------------------+---------------------------------+
   |   2   |      00000010         |   Allow 2.xx success responses. |
   +-------+-----------------------+---------------------------------+
   |   8   |      00001000         |     Allow 4.xx client errors.   |
   +-------+-----------------------+---------------------------------+
   |  16   |      00010000         |     Allow 5.xx server errors.   |
   +-------+-----------------------+---------------------------------+
                          Table 3: Option values


   XOR of the values defined for allowing particular classes will
   result in allowing a combination of classes of responses. So, a
   value of 18 (binary: 00010010) will result in allowing all 2.xx and
   5.xx classes of responses. It is to be noted that a value of 26 will
   indicate that all types of responses are to be allowed (which is as
   good as not using No-Response at all).

   Implementation Note: The use of No-Response option is very much
       driven by the application scenario and the characteristics of the
       information to be updated. Judicious use of this option benefits
       the overall system as explained in sections 2 and 3.

       When No-Response is used with empty or 0 value, the updating
       end-point should cease the listening activity for response
       against the particular request. On the contrary, opening up at
       least one class of responses means that the updating end-point
       can no longer stop listening and must be configured to listen up
       to some application specific time-out period for the particular
       request. The updating end-point never knows whether the present
       update will be a success or a failure. Thus, if the client
       decides to open up the responses for errors (4.xx & 5.xx) then it
       has to wait for the entire time-out period even for the instances
       where the request is successful (and the server is not supposed
       to send back a response). This kind of situation may arise for
       the scenario in section 3.2.1. Under such circumstances the use
       of No-Response may not help improving the performance in terms of

       overall latency. However, the advantages in terms of saving
       network and energy resources will still hold.

       A point to be noted in view of the above example is that there
       may be situations when the response on errors might get lost. In
       such a situation the sender would wait up to the time-out period
       but will not receive any response. But this should not lead to
       the impression to the sender that the request was successful. The
       situation will worsen if the receiver is no longer active. The
       application designer needs to tackle such situation. Since this
       option is conceived for frequent updates, the sender may
       strategically insert requests without No-Response after N numbers
       of requests with No-Response (similar to the way [I-D.ietf-core-
       observe] 'weaves' CON notifications within series of NON
       notifications to check if the observer is alive).

5. Example

   This section illustrates few examples of exchanges based on the
   scenario narrated in section 3.1. Examples for other scenarios can
   be easily conceived based on these illustrations.

5.1. Request/response Scenario

5.1.1. Using No-Response with PUT

   Figure 1 shows a typical request with this option. The depicted
   scenario occurs when the vehicle#n moves very fast and update rate
   is high. The vehicle is assigned a dedicated resource: vehicle-stat-
   <n>, where <n> can be any string uniquely identifying the vehicle.
   The update requests are in NON mode. The No-Response option causes
   the server not to reply with any status code.

5.1.2. Using No-Response with POST

   POST "usually results in a new resource being created or the target
   resource being updated". Exemplary uses of 'No-Response' for both
   these 'usual' actions of POST are given below.

5.1.2.1. POST updating a target resource

   In this case POST acts the same way as PUT. The exchanges are same
   as above. The updated values are carried as payload of POST as shown
   in Figure 2.

                        POST as the update-method.

5.1.2.2. POST performing updates through resource creation

   In most practical implementations the backend of section 3.1 will
   have a dedicated database to store the location updates. In such a
   case the client would send an update string as the POST URI which
   contains the name/value pairs for each update. Thus frequent updates
   may be performed through POST by creating such 'short-lived'
   resources which the client would not refer to in future. Hence 'No-
   Response' can be used in same manner as for updating fixed
   resources. The scenario is depicted in Figure 3.

      POST with a query-string to insert update information to backend
                                database.

5.2. Resource-observe Scenario

   This option should be treated transparently if used with NON
   notifications. In other words, just like GET and DELETE, this option
   will have no effect for observe notifications. The following example
   demonstrates how optimizations achieved using No-Response may also
   be achieved using resource-observe mode in certain situations at
   least in theory.

   For example, the scenario of section 3.1 may also be achieved using
   resource-observe. In that case the backend will have to subscribe to
   each of the in-vehicle sensor gateway. The gateways will notify the
   backend with updated geo-locations. However, considering the huge
   number of vehicles moving around and several being added to the
   system quite often, this kind of arrangement may not be as

   practicable and efficient solution as illustrated in the previous
   examples.

   Figure 4 shows the resource observe variant. The No-Response option
   has been used intentionally both with GET and the notifications to
   illustrate the non-applicability of this option in this situation.

   |      | Uri-Path: vehicle-stat
   |      | Observe : (empty)

   |      | Payload:
   |      | "VehID=00&RouteID=DN47&Lat=22.5658745&Long=88.4107966667&
   |      | Time=2013-01-13T11:24:31"
   |      |
   [Next update in 20 secs.]
   |      |
   +----->| Header: 2.05 (T=NON, MID=0x7d39)
   | 2.05 | Token: 0x53

   |      | Time=2013-01-13T11:24:51"


    Figure 4: Exemplary unreliable update in resource-observe mode with
      No-Response option where practically No-Response has no effect.

   Note: The reason for keeping this example is to open up the choice
       to the user when there is a possibility of choosing between
       resource-observe with NON and updates with No-Response and to
       show a possible case where the latter option may sound more
       useful.

6. IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to add the following option number entries:

7. Security Considerations

   The No-Response option defined in this document presents no security
   considerations beyond those in Section 11 of the base CoAP
   specification [I-D.ietf-core-coap].
