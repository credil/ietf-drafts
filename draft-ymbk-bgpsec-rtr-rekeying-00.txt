1.  Introduction

   BGPsec-speaking routers must be provisioned with private keys and the
   corresponding public key must be published in the global RPKI
   (Resource Public Key Infrastructure).  Note that the public key is
   published in the RPKI in the form of a certificate [I-D.sidr-bgpsec-
   pki-profiles]. This document describes two methods for generating the
   necessary public/private key-pair: router-driven and operator-driven.

   In the router-driven method, the router generates its own
   public/private key-pair, uses the private key to sign a certification
   request [I-D.sidr-bgpsec-pki-profiles] (a PKCS#10 - includes the
   public key), and sends the certification request to the RPKI CA
   (Certification Authority).  The CA returns a PKCS#7, which includes
   the certified public key in the form of a certificate, to the router
   and the CA also publishes the certificate in the RPKI.

   The router-driven model mirrors the model used by most PKI
   subscribers.  In many cases, the private key never leaves trusted
   storage (e.g., HSM (Hardware Security Model)).  This is by design and
   supports CPs (Certification Policies), often times for human
   subscribers, that require the private key only ever be controlled by
   the subscriber to ensure that no one can impersonate the subscriber.

   For non-humans, this model does not always work.  For example, when
   an operator wants to support hot-swappable routers the same private
   key needs to be installed in the soon-to-be online router that was
   installed in the soon-to-be offline router.  This motivated the
   operator-driven model.

   In the operator-driven model, the operator generates the
   private/public key-pair and sends them to the router in a PKCS#8
   [RFC5958].

   In both cases, the key pair is for algorithms defined in [I-D.sidr-
   bgpsec-algs].  The first version specifies ECDSA on the P-256 curve.


2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   It is assumed that the reader understands BGPsec, see [I-D.lepinski-
   bgpsec-overview] and [I-D.lepinski-bgpsec-protocol], and the RPKI,
   see [RFC6480] and [I-D.sidr-bgpsec-pki-profiles].


3.  Router-Generated Keys

   For router-generated keys, the public/private keys are made by the
   router, a PKCS#10 is made by the router, the PKCS#10 is signed by the
   private key.  The CA returns a PKCS#7 and the router picks the
   certificate out of the PKCS#7.  Even if the operator can not get the
   private key off the router this still provides a linkage between a
   private key and a router.


4.  Operator-Generated Keys

   For operator-generated keys, the public/private keys are made by the
   operator with their RPKI management software.  The private key pair
   MUST be as specified in [RFC5915], which supports ECDSA keys.  That
   format MUST then be inserted to a PKCS#8 [RFC5958] along with the
   certificate.  If the operator wants to ship the keys around they can
   use the .p8 file extension and optional PEM encoding also from
   [RFC5958].

   EDITOR NOTE: One thing we should consider is whether the certificate
   needs to returned to the router like in the router-generated keys
   method.  PKCS#8 supports including the certificate so it's not a big

   deal to add it if we do.


5.  Provisioning a New Router

   When commissioning a new router, the operator may use either of the
   above methods.

   Using the Router-Generated Keys method, see Section 3, the operator
   decides on the AS number and the BGP RouterID of the router, logs on
   to the new router using the craft port, ssh, etc., and requests that
   the router generate a public/private key-pair and generate and sign
   (with the private key) a PKCS#10 request.  The operator then off-
   loads the PKCS#10 request and uploads the request to their RPKI
   software management tools.  The tools create and publish the RPKI
   Router-Key object for the public key, and return the PKCS#7.  The
   operator uploads the PKCS#7 to the router which then extracts its
   certificate.

   Using the Operator-Generated Key method, see Section 4, the operator
   decides on the AS number and the BGP RouterID of the new router and
   uses their RPKI software management tools to generate the
   public/private key-pair and publish the public key in the RPKI.  The
   tools also produce the PKCS#8 object which the operator then uploads
   into the new router via the craft port, ssh, NetConf, etc.  The
   router installs the PKS#8 and installs the public/private key-
   pair.</t>


6.  Other Use Cases

   Current router code generates private keys for uses such as ssh, but
   the private keys may not be seen or off-loaded via CLI or any other
   means.  While this is good security, it creates difficulties when a
   routing engine or whole router must be replaced in the field and all
   software which accesses the router must be updated with the new keys.
    Also, the initial contact with a new routing engine requires trust
   in the public key presented on first contact.

   To allow operators to quickly replace routers without requiring
   update and distribution of the corresponding public keys in the RPKI,
   routers SHOULD allow the private BGPsec key to be off-loaded via the
   CLI, NetConf (see [RFC6470]), SNMP, etc.  This lets the operator
   upload the old private key via the mechanism used for Operator-
   Generated Keys, see Section 5.


7.  Security Considerations

   Keys could be intercepted in transport and the recipient, RPKI or
   router, would have no way of knowing a substitution had been made by
   a monkey in the middle.  Hence transport security is strongly
   advised.

   openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp256v1 -noout -out ecKey.pem

   The result is (note this ought not be reproducible because each
   key better be unique, but you ought to get the same format):
