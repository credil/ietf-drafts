Abstract

   One of the requirements of the MPLS transport profile [RFC5654] is
   to provide linear protection for transport paths, which include both
   LSPs and PWs. The functional architecture described in [SurvivFwk]
   is applicable to both LSP and PWs, however [LinearProt] does not
   explicitly describe mechanisms for PW protection in MPLS-TP.

   This document extends the applicability of the linear protection
   mechanism described in [LinearProt] to MPLS-TP segmented PWs as
   defined in [RFC6073].

1. Introduction

   When specifying the requirements for an MPLS Transport Profile,
   [RFC5654] states that "In an MPLS-TP environment, a transport path
   corresponds to an LSP or a PW". It follows that recovery
   requirements in section 2.5 of [RFC5654] apply to PWs as well as to
   LSPs. The MPLS-TP survivability framework described in [SurvivFwk]
   states that "The general description of the functional architecture
   is applicable to both LSPs and pseudowires (PWs), however, PW
   recovery is only introduced in Section 7, and the relevant details
   are beyond the scope of this document and are for further study".
   Finally, the MPLS-TP OAM framework described in [OamFwk] provides
   tools for PW monitoring that are suitable for PW protection
   triggering.

Internet-Draft    MPLS-TP LP Applicability to MS-PW           Jul 2011


   [LinearProt] describes a protection state coordination (PSC)
   protocol that can be used to provide linear protection for LSPs.
   This document extends the applicability of the PSC control logic and
   protocol to support MPLS-TP segmented PW (aka MS-PW) protection
   against S-PE failure.

1.1. Background on MS-PW

   This section reviews operator motivations for MS-PW usage in an
   MPLS-TP framework. Some of these are mentioned in [RFC5254] and
   [RFC6073].

   o PSN Internetworking: The PW route may go across nodes that are
      interconnected using different PSN protocols. In this case, it is
      not possible to establish a single LSP between the terminating
      PEs, and therefore a single-segment PW (SS-PW) cannot be used.

   o Domain separation:  The PW route may cross different
      administrative domains, either intra- or inter-operator. In this
      scenario, it may not be possible to establish a single transport
      path (LSP or PW) between nodes in different operators, so SS-PW
      cannot be used.

   o Reduce network delay variations: Some end users (e.g. financial
      customers) are very sensitive to the network delay provided by
      the operator service. Operators therefore want to minimize both
      the absolute network delay provided, and the variations in
      network delay upon different events, specifically node or link
      failures. SS-PW recovery from a link failure requires end-to-end
      switching to another SS-PW which will typically have a different
      network route and thus provide a significantly different network
      delay. MS-PW, on the other hand, allows link failure recovery by
      local switching on the failed segment, which typically achieves
      much lower network delay variation.
      MS-PW end-to-end switching, involving higher network delay
      variation, is performed only upon node (S-PE) failure.

1.2. MS-PW protection requirements

   PW protection is required to support PW recovery upon node failure
   of an S-PE in an MS-PW application. MS-PW and S-PE are defined in
   [RFC6073]. LSP recovery is not possible in this scenario and
   therefore a separate mechanism is required to provide MS-PW
   recovery.

   Figure 1 illustrates such a scenario, where two MS-PWs are
   established between T-PE A and T-PE Z, over S-PEs 1-2 and 3-4

   respectively. Each PW segment is established over an LSP (e.g. PW-
   s12 over LSP12).

                <--------------MS-PW A34Z------------->

                       Figure 1: MS-PW protection


   Without loss of generality, it is assumed that MS-PW A12Z is active
   in the normal state. In the event of a failure in S-PE 1, LSPs A1
   and 12 cannot recover by using LSP protection mechanisms, but the
   MS-PW can recover by switching to MS-PW A34Z.

   This mechanism requires coordination between the two MS-PW endpoints
   to decide which of the two MS-PWs will be active, i.e. transmitting
   data traffic.
