1. Introduction

   OAM (Operations, Administration and Maintenance) generally covers
   various production aspects of a network. In this document we use the
   term OAM as defined in [RFC6291].

   Success of any mission critical network depends on the ability to
   proactively monitor networks for faults, performance, etc. as well
   as its ability to efficiently and quickly troubleshoot defects and
   failures.  A well-defined OAM toolset is a vital requirement for
   wider adoption of TRILL as the next generation data forwarding
   technology in larger networks such as data centers.

   In this document we define the Requirements for TRILL OAM. Also the
   proposed format for OAM frames is presented.

   It is assumed that the readers are familiar with the OAM concepts
   and terminologies defined in other OAM standards such as [802.1ag],
   [RFC5860]. This document does not attempt to redefine the terms and
   concepts specified elsewhere.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].
   Although this document is not a protocol specification, the use of
   this language clarifies the instructions to protocol designers
   producing solutions that satisfy the requirements set out in this
   document.

3. Terminology

   Section: The term Section refers to a partial segment of a path
   between any two given RBridges. As an example, consider the case
   where RB1 is connected to RBx via RB2,RB3 and RB4. The segment
   between RB2 to RB4 is referred to as a Section of the path RB1 to
   RBx.

   Flow: The term Flow indicates a set of packets that share the same
   path and per-hop behavior (such as priority). A flow is typically
   identified by a portion of the inner payload that affects the hop-by
   hop forwarding decisions. This may contain Layer 2 through Layer 4
   information.

   All Least Cost Paths: The term "all least cost paths" refers to all
   potentially available least cost paths from a given source to a
   specified destination RBridge as determined by the TRILL network
   topology learned from IS-IS. ECMP: Equal Cost Multi Path.

   Connectivity: The term connectivity indicates reachability between
   an arbitrary RBridge RB1 and any other RBridge RB2. The specific
   path can be either explicit (e.g. specific flow) or unspecified.
   Unspecified means taking whatever the path connectivity verification
   message happen to take.

   Continuity Verification: Continuity Verification refers to proactive
   verification of Connectivity between two RBridges at periodic

   intervals and generation of explicit notification when Connectivity
   failures occur.

   Fault: The term Fault refers to an inability to perform a required
   action, e.g., an unsuccessful attempt to deliver a packet.

   Defect: The term Defect refers to an interruption in the normal
   operation, such that over a period of time no packets are delivered
   successfully.

   Failure: The term Failure refers to the termination of the required
   function over a longer period of time. Persistence of a defect for a
   period of time is interpreted as a failure.

4. OAM Requirements

4.1. Data Plane

   OAM frames, utilized for connectivity verification, continuity
   checks, performance measurements, etc., MUST follow the same path as
   the specified flow.

   OAM frames, utilized for connectivity verification, continuity
   checks, performance measurements, etc., when a specific flow is not
   specified MUST follow whatever the path TRILL choose based on
   current topology, per-hop forwarding behavior and default flow
   entropy.

   RBridges MUST have the ability to identify OAM frames destined for
   them or which require processing by the OAM plane from normal data
   frames.

   RBridges MUST have the ability to differentiate between OAM frames
   and data frames experiencing errors.



   TRILL OAM frames MUST be confined to the TRILL domain and MUST NOT
   be forwarded out of the TRILL domain. E.g. they must not be sent as
   native frames on an end station service enabled port

   OAM MUST have the capability to provide services for both IP and
   non-IP flows.

   OAM MUST be able to function in IP and non-IP infrastructure.

4.2. Connectivity Verification

4.2.1. Unicast

   OAM MUST have the ability to verify connectivity from an arbitrary
   RBridge RB1 to any other RBridge RB2.

   OAM MUST have the ability to verify connectivity from an arbitrary
   RBridge RB1 to any other RBridge RB2 for a specific flow.

   An RBridge SHOULD have the ability to verify the above connectivity
   tests on sections. As an example, assume RB1 is connected to RB5 via
   RB2, RB3 and RB4. An operator SHOULD be able to verify the RB1 to
   RB5 connectivity on the section from RB3 to RB5. The difference is
   that the ingress and egress TRILL nicknames in this case are RB1 and
   RB5 as opposed to RB3 and RB5, even though the message itself may
   originate at RB3.

   OAM MUST have the ability to invoke the above functions on-demand.

4.2.2. Multicast

   OAM MUST have the ability to verify connectivity, from an arbitrary
   RBridge RB1, to either to a specific set of RBridges or all member
   RBridges, for a specified multicast tree. This functionality is
   referred to as verification of the un-pruned multicast tree.

   OAM MUST have the ability to verify connectivity, from an arbitrary
   RBridge RB1, to either to a specific set of RBridges or all member
   RBridges, for a specified multicast tree and for a specified flow.
   This functionality is referred to as verification of the pruned
   tree.

   OAM MUST have the ability to invoke the above functions on-demand.

4.3. Continuity Check

   [RFC5860] defines Continuity Check as the ability of end points to
   monitor liveliness of a path or a section of a path [RFC5860]. We
   use similar semantics in this document where end points are the
   ingress or egress RBridges.

   OAM MUST provide functions that allow any arbitrary RBridge RB1 to
   perform a Continuity Check to any other RBridge.

Internet-Draft          TRILL OAM Requirements                June 2012


   OAM MUST provide functions that allow any arbitrary RBridge RB1 to
   perform a Continuity Check to any other RBridge for a specified
   flow.

   OAM SHOULD provide functions that allow any arbitrary RBridge to
   perform a Continuity Check to any other RBridge over all available
   least cost paths.

   OAM SHOULD provide the ability to perform a Continuity Check on
   sections of any path within the network.

   OAM SHOULD provide the ability to perform a multicast Continuity
   Check for specified multi-destination tree(s) as well as specified
   multi-destination tree and flow combinations. The former is referred
   to as an un-pruned multi-destination tree Continuity Check and the
   latter is referred to as a pruned tree Continuity Check.

   OAM implementations SHOULD support at least a minimum frequency of 1
   second of Continuity check.

   OAM implementations SHOULD support multiple concurrent Continuity
   sessions from and/or to the same RBridge.



4.4. Path Tracing

   OAM MUST provide the ability to trace a path between any two
   RBridges per specified unicast flow.

   OAM SHOULD provide the ability to trace all least cost paths between
   any two RBridges.

   OAM SHOULD provide functionality to trace all branches of a
   specified multi-destination tree (un-pruned tree)

   OAM SHOULD provide functionality to trace all branches of a
   specified multi-destination tree for a specified flow (pruned tree).

4.5. General Requirements

   OAM MUST provide the ability to initiate and maintain multiple
   concurrent sessions for multiple OAM functions between any arbitrary
   RBridge RB1 to any other RBridge.

   OAM MUST NOT require extensions to or modifications of the TRILL
   header.

   OAM MUST provide a single OAM framework for all TRILL OAM functions

   OAM, as practical and as possible, SHOULD provide a single framework
   between TRILL and other similar standards.

   OAM MUST maintain related error and operational counters. SUCH
   counters MUST be accessible via network management applications
   (e.g. SNMP).

   Operations of OAM MUST NOT result in errors on end devices.

   OAM MAY be required to provide the ability to specify a desired
   response mode for a specific OAM message. The desired response mode
   can be either in-band, out-of band or none.

   The OAM Framework MUST be extensible to future needs of TRILL and
   the needs of other standard organizations.

   OAM MAY provide methods to verify control plane and forwarding plane
   alignments.

   OAM SHOULD leverage existing OAM technologies, where practical.

4.6. Performance Monitoring

4.6.1. Packet Loss

   In this document, term loss of a packet is used as defined in
   [RFC2680] (see Section 2.4 of RFC2680).

   NOTE: Term simulated flow below indicates a flow that is generated
   by an RBRidge RB1 for OAM purposes. The fields of the simulated flow
   may or may not be identical to the actual data. However, simulated
   flow is required to follow the intended path.

   OAM SHOULD provide the ability to measure packet loss statistics for
   a simulated flow from any arbitrary RBridge RB1 to any other
   RBridge.

   OAM SHOULD provide the ability to measure packet loss statistics
   over a segment, for a simulated flow between any arbitrary RBridge
   RB1 to any other RBridge.

   OAM SHOULD provide the ability to measure simulated packet loss
   statistics between any two RBridges over all least cost paths.

Internet-Draft          TRILL OAM Requirements                June 2012


   An RBridge SHOULD be able to perform the above packet loss
   measurement functions either proactively or on-demand.

4.6.2. Packet Delay

   There are two types of packet delays -- one-way delay and two-way
   delay (Round Trip Delay).

   One-way delay is defined in [RFC2679] as the time elapsed from the
   start of transmission of the first bit of a packet by an RBridge
   until the reception of the last bit of the packet by the destination
   RBridge.

   Two-way delay is also referred to as Round Trip Delay is defined
   similar to [RFC2681]; i.e. the time elapsed from the start of
   transmission of the first bit of a packet by an RBridge until the
   reception of the last bit of the packet by the same RBridge.

   OAM SHOULD provide functions to measure two-way delay between two
   RBridges for a specified flow.

   OAM SHOULD provide functions to measure two-way delay between two
   RBridges for a specified flow over a specific section.

   OAM MAY provide functions to measure one-way delay between two
   RBridges for a specified flow.

   OAM MAY provide functions to measure one-way delay between two
   RBridges for a specified flow over a specific section.



4.7. ECMP Utilization

   OAM MAY provide functionality to monitor the effectiveness of per-
   hop ECMP hashing. For example, individual RBridges could maintain
   counters that show how packets are being distributed across equal
   cost next hops for a specified destination RBridge or RBridges as a
   result of ECMP hashing.

4.8. Security and Operational considerations

   Methods MUST be provided to protect against exploitation of OAM
   framework for security and denial of service attacks.

   Methods SHOULD be provided to prevent OAM messages causing
   congestion in the networks. Periodically generated messages with

Internet-Draft          TRILL OAM Requirements                June 2012


   high frequencies may lead to congestion, hence methods such as
   shaping or rate limiting SHOULD be utilized.

4.9. Fault Indications

   The term Fault refers to an inability to perform a required action,
   e.g., an unsuccessful attempt to deliver a packet [OAMOVER]. The
   unsuccessful attempt may be due to Hop Count expiry, invalid
   nickname, etc.

   OAM MUST provide a Fault Indication framework to notify faults to
   the ingress RBRidge of the flow or other interested parties (such as
   syslog servers).

   OAM MUST provide functions to selectively enable or disable
   different types of Fault Indications.

4.10. Defect Indications

   [OAMOVER] defines "The term Defect refers to an interruption in the
   normal operation, such as a consecutive period of time where no
   packets are delivered successfully."

   OAM SHOULD provide a framework for Defect Detection and Indication.

   OAM implementations that provide Defect Indication MUST provide
   methods to selectively enable or disable Defect Detection per defect
   type.

   OAM implementations that provide Defect Indication MUST provide
   methods to configure Defect Detection thresholds per different types
   of defects.

   OAM implementations that provide Defect Indication facilities MUST
   provide methods to log defect indications to a locally defined
   archive such as log buffer or SNMP traps.

   OAM implementations that provide Defect Indication facilities SHOULD
   provide a Remote Defect Indication framework that facilitates
   notifying the originator/owner of the flow experiencing the defect,
   which is the ingress RBridge.

   Remote Defect Indication MAY be either in-band or out-of-band.

4.11. Live Traffic monitoring

   OAM implementations MAY provide methods to utilize live traffic for
   troubleshooting and performance monitoring.

   Implementations MAY leverage Data Driven CFM [802.1Q] or IPFIX
   [RFC5101] for the purpose of performance monitoring.

5. General Format of TRILL OAM Messages

   The TRILL forwarding paradigm allows an implementation to select a
   path from a set of equal cost paths to forward a packet. Selection
   of the path of choice is implementation dependent. However, it is a
   common practice to utilize Layer 2 through Layer 4 information in
   the inner payload for path selection.

   As specified above, OAM Messages are required to follow the exact
   path as the data packets.

   The proposed frame format for TRILL OAM messages is as follows.

Internet-Draft          TRILL OAM Requirements                June 2012


   Outer Header: Media dependent header. For Ethernet this included
   Destination MAC, Source MAC, VLAN (optional) and EtherType fields.

   TRILL Header: Minimum of 8 bytes when the Extended Header is not
   included [RFC6325]

   Flow Entropy: This is a 128 byte Fixed size opaque field. The field
   MUST be padded with zeros when the flow entropy is less than 128
   bytes. Flow entropy emulates the forwarding behavior of the desired
   data packets.

   OAM Message Channel: This is a variable size section that carries
   OAM related information. Reusing existing OAM message definitions
   such as [RFC4379] and [802.1ag] will be explored.

5.1. Requirements of OAM Message channel

   The OAM Message channel header MUST contain a version number

   The OAM Message channel header MUST contain flags that facilitate
   hardware level processing. (e.g. indicate this is two-way delay
   measurement probe)

   The OAM Message channel MUST contain time stamping in fixed
   locations to facilitate hardware level performance monitoring. (e.g.
   delay measurements).

   The OAM Message channel MUST have the ability to be extensible to
   include future capabilities without requiring a change to the
   version of the message header. (e.g. include TLV structures)

   The OAM Message header MUST contain a unique marker that allows for
   identifying the presence of the OAM channel. This marker MUST
   provide equal or better uniqueness compared to the IP checksum
   define in [RFC791]

   The OAM Message SHOULD provide methods to include arbitrary data to
   test functions such as MTU testing.

6. Security Considerations

   Security Requirements are specified in section 4.8.

7. IANA Considerations

   <TBD>
