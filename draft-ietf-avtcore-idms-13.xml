    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a new RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Packet Type
      and an RTCP Extended Report (XR) Block Type to be used for achieving
      Inter-Destination Media Synchronization (IDMS). IDMS is the process of
      synchronizing playout across multiple geographically distributed media
      receivers. Using the RTCP XR IDMS Report Block defined in this document,
      media playout information from participants in a synchronization group
      can be collected. Based on the collected information, an RTCP IDMS
      Settings Packet can then be sent to distribute a common target playout
      point to which all the distributed receivers, sharing a media
      experience, can synchronize.</t>

      <t>Typical use cases in which IDMS is useful are social TV, shared
      service control (i.e. applications where two or more geographically
      separated users are watching a media stream together), distance
      learning, networked video walls, networked loudspeakers, etc.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Inter-Destination Media Synchronization (IDMS) refers to the playout
      of media streams at two or more geographically distributed locations in
      a time synchronized manner. It can be applied to both unicast and
      multicast media streams and can be applied to any type and/or
      combination of streaming media, such as audio, video and text
      (subtitles).<xref target="Ishibashi2006"> </xref> and <xref
      target="Boronat2009"/> provide an overview of technologies and
      algorithms for IDMS.</t>

      <t>IDMS requires the exchange of information on media receipt and
      playout times among participants in an IDMS session. It may also require
      signaling for the initiation and maintenance of IDMS sessions and groups
      of receivers.</t>

      <t>The presented RTCP specification for IDMS is independent of the used
      synchronization algorithm, which is out-of-scope of this document.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Rationale">
      <t/>

      <section anchor="intro_applic_idms"
               title="Applicability of RTCP to IDMS">
        <t>Currently, a large share of real-time applications make use of RTP
        and RTCP <xref target="RFC3550"/>. RTP provides end-to-end network
        transport functions suitable for applications requiring real-time data
        transport, such as audio, video or data, over multicast or unicast
        network services. The timestamps, sequence numbers, and payload
        (content) type identification mechanisms provided by RTP packets are
        very useful for reconstructing the original media timing, the original
        order of packets and for detecting packet loss at the client side.</t>

        <t>The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to
        allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner that is scalable to
        large groups, and to provide minimal control and identification
        functionality. RTP receivers and senders provide reception quality
        feedback by sending out RTCP Receiver Report (RR) and Sender Report
        (SR) packets <xref target="RFC3550"/>, respectively, which may be
        augmented by eXtended Reports (XR) <xref target="RFC3611"/>. Both RTP
        and RTCP are intended to be tailored to modifications in order to
        include profile-specific information required by particular
        applications, and the guidelines on doing so are specified in <xref
        target="RFC5868"/>.</t>

        <t>IDMS involves the collection, summarizing and distribution of RTP
        packet arrival and playout times. As information on RTP packet arrival
        times and playout times can be considered reception quality feedback
        information, RTCP is well suited for carrying out IDMS, which may
        facilitate the implementation and deployment in typical multimedia
        applications.</t>

        <t/>
      </section>

      <section title="IDMS and ETSI">
        <t>A first version of IDMS for use with RTP/RTCP was standardized by
        ETSI TISPAN in <xref target="TS183063"/>, resulting in an IANA
        registration for an RTCP IDMS XR Block. At some point in time, this
        work was brought as input to the IETF AVTCORE WG for further
        standardization, leveraging the RTP/RTCP expertise present in the
        AVTCORE WG. This document is the result of that effort.</t>

        <t>Although the IDMS protocol described in this document has evolved
        significantly from the version that was originally specified by ETSI
        TISPAN, it is still backwards compatible with the ETSI version. As
        such, it had been decided in ETSI to update the TS 183 063 document to
        reference this document as the normative specification of IDMS. This
        update can be found in newer versions of TS 183 063 (&gt;3.5.2). In
        accordance, this document proposes to update the IANA registration for
        the RTCP IDMS XR Block to point to this document. Finally, this
        document proposes an IANA registry for SPST values, allowing the
        registration of extensions to this document.</t>

    <section anchor="usecases"
             title="Inter-Destination Media Synchronization (IDMS) use cases">
      <t>There are a large number of use cases in which IDMS might be useful.
      This section will highlight some of them. It should be noted that this
      section is in no way meant to be exhaustive.</t>

      <t>A first usage scenario for IDMS is social TV. Social TV is the
      combination of media content consumption by two or more users at
      different devices and locations combined with the real-time
      communication between those users. An example of social TV is when two
      or more users are watching the same television broadcast at different
      devices and locations, while communicating with each other using text,
      audio and/or video. A skew in their media playout processes can have
      adverse effects on their experience. A well-known use case here is one
      friend experiencing a goal in a football match well before or after
      other friend(s).</t>

      <t>Another potential use case for IDMS is a networked video wall. A
      video wall consists of multiple computer monitors, video projectors, or
      television sets tiled together contiguously or overlapped in order to
      form one large screen. Each of the screens reproduces a portion of the
      larger picture. In some implementations, each screen may be individually
      connected to the network and receive its portion of the overall image
      from a network-connected video server or video scaler. Screens are
      refreshed at 60 hertz (every 16-2/3 milliseconds) or potentially faster.
      If the refresh is not synchronized, the effect of multiple screens
      acting as one is broken, with users noticing tearing effects and no
      longer perceiving a single image. </t>

      <t>A third usage scenario is that of the networked loudspeakers, in
      which two or more speakers are connected to the network individually.
      Such situations can for example be found in large conference rooms,
      legislative chambers, classrooms (especially those supporting distance
      learning) and other large-scale environments such as stadiums. Since
      humans are more susceptible to differences in audio delay, this use case
      needs even more accuracy than the video wall use case. Depending on the
      exact application, the need for accuracy can then be in the range of
      microseconds.</t>

               Figure 1: Example of a typical IDMS session
]]></artwork>
        </figure></t>

      <t>Alice is watching TV in her living room. At some point she sees that
      a football game of Bob's favorite team is on. She sends him an invite to
      watch the program together. Embedded in the invitation is the link to
      the media server and a unique sync-group identifier.</t>

      <t>Bob, who is also at home, receives the invite on his laptop. He
      accepts Alice's invitation and the RTP client on his laptop sets up a
      session to the media server. A VoIP connection to Alice's TV is also set
      up, so that Alice and Bob can talk while watching the game together.</t>

      <t>As is common with RTP, both the RTP client in Alice's TV as well as
      the one in Bob's laptop send periodic RTCP Receiver Reports (RR) to the
      media server. However, in order to make sure Alice and Bob see the
      events in the football game at (approximately) the same time, their
      clients also periodically send an RTCP XR IDMS Report Block to the Sync
      Server function of the media server. Included in the XR IDMS blocks are
      timestamps on when both Alice and Bob received (and, optionally, when
      they played out) a particular RTP packet.</t>

      <t>The Sync Server function in the media server calculates a reference
      client from the received XR IDMS Report Blocks (e.g. by selecting the
      most lagged client as the reference for IDMS). It then sends an RTCP
      IDMS Settings packet containing the playout information of this
      reference client to the sync clients of both Alice and Bob.</t>

      <t>In this case Bob's connection has the longest delay and the reference
      client therefore includes a delay similar to the one experienced by Bob.
      Upon reception of this information, Alice's RTP client can choose what
      to do with this information. In this case it decreases its playout rate
      temporarily until the playout time matches with the reference client
      playout (and thus matches Bob's playout). Another option for Alice's TV
      would be to simply pause playback until it catches up. The exact
      implementation of the synchronization algorithm is up to the client.</t>

      <t>Upon reception of the RTCP IDMS Settings packet, Bob's client does
      not have to do anything since it is already synchronized to the
      reference client (since it is based on Bob's delay). Note that other
      synchronization algorithms may introduce even more delay than the one
      experienced by the most delayed client, e.g. to account for delay
      variations, for new clients joining an existing synchronization group,
      etc.</t>

      <t>For this functionality to work correctly, it is necessary that the
      wall clocks of the receivers are synchronized with each other. Alice and
      Bob both report when they receive, and optionally when they play out,
      certain RTP packets. In order to correlate their reports to each other,
      it is necessary that their wallclocks are synchronized.</t>

      <section anchor="arch_msas"
               title="Media Synchronization Application Server (MSAS)">
        <t>An MSAS collects RTP packet arrival times and playout times from
        one or more SC(s) in a synchronization group by receiving RTCP IDMS XR
        Reports. The MSAS summarizes and distributes this information to the
        SCs in the synchronization group as synchronization settings via the
        RTCP IDMS Settings messages, e.g. by determining the SC with the most
        lagged playout and using its reported RTP packet arrival time and
        playout time as a summary.</t>

        <t>It should be noted that while the figure above shows the MSAS as
        part of the RTP Sender, this is not necessary. For example, an MSAS
        might also be implemented as an independent function in the network or
        in a master/slave type of architecture where one of the SC devices
        also acts as an MSAS. Wherever the MSAS is implemented, it is
        important that the MSAS has access to the RTP stream to which the XR
        Reports apply, so that it is able to correlate the IDMS XR Reports
        coming from different SCs.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="arch_sc" title="Synchronization Client (SC)">
        <t>An SC reports on RTP packet arrival times and playout times of a
        media stream. It can receive summaries of such information, and use
        that to adjust its playout buffer. The SC sends RTCP IDMS XR Reports
        to the MSAS.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="arch_comm" title="Communication between MSAS and SCs">
        <t>Two different message types are used for the communication between
        MSAS and SCs. For the SC-&gt;MSAS message containing the playout
        information of a particular client, an RTCP XR IDMS Report Block is
        used (see <xref target="xr_block_type"/>). For the MSAS-&gt;SC message
        containing the synchronization settings instructions, a new RTCP IDMS
        Settings Packet Type is defined (see <xref
        target="rtcp_packet_type"/>).</t>

      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="xr_block_type"
             title="RTCP XR Block for IDMS (IDMS Report Block)">
      <t>This section specifies a new RTCP XR Block Type, the RTCP XR IDMS
      Report Block, for reporting IDMS information to an MSAS. In particular
      it is used to provide feedback information on receipt times and
      presentation times of RTP packets. Its definition is based on <xref
      target="RFC3550"/> and <xref target="RFC3611"/>.</t>

      <t>In most cases, a single RTP receiver will only be part of a single
      IDMS session, i.e. it will report on receipt and presentation times of
      RTP packets from a single RTP stream in a certain synchronization group.
      In some cases, however, an RTP receiver may be a member of multiple
      synchronization groups for the same RTP stream, e.g. watching a single
      television program simultaneously with different groups. In even further
      cases, a receiver may wish to synchronize different RTP streams at the
      same time, either as part of the same synchronization group or as part
      of multiple synchronization groups. These are all valid scenarios for
      IDMS, and will require multiple reports by an SC.</t>

      <t>This document does not define new rules on when to send RTCP reports,
      but uses the existing rules specified in <xref target="RFC3550"/> for
      sending RTCP reports. When the RTCP reporting timer allows an SC to send
      an IDMS report, the SC SHOULD report on an RTP packet received during
      the period since the last RTCP XR IDMS Report Block was sent. Because of
      RTP timestamp rollover, there is ambiguity in mapping RTP timestamps to
      NTP timestamps. The recommendation to report on recent RTP packets
      serves to manage this ambiguity. For more details on which packet to

      <t>The IDMS report block consists of 8 32-bit words, with the following
      fields:</t>

      <t>Block Type (BT): 8 bits. It identifies the block format. Its value is
      set to 12.</t>

      <t>Synchronization Packet Sender Type (SPST): 4 bits. This field
      identifies the role of the packet sender for this specific eXtended
      Report. It can have the following values, as maintained by IANA (see
      <xref target="spst-reg"/>):</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t>SPST=0 Reserved for future use.</t>

          <t>SPST=1 The packet sender is an SC. It uses this XR to report
          synchronization status information. Timestamps relate to the SC
          input.</t>

          <t>SPST=2-4 Values defined by ETSI TISPAN (see <xref
          target="TS183063"/>).</t>

          <t>SPST=5-15 Unassigned.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Reserved bits (Resrv): 3 bits. These bits are reserved for future
      definition. In the absence of such a definition, the bits in this field
      MUST be set to zero at transmission and MUST be ignored by the
      receiver.</t>

      <t>Packet Presented NTP timestamp flag (P): 1 bit. Bit set to 1 if the
      Packet Presented NTP timestamp field contains a value, 0 if it is empty.
      If this flag is set to zero, then the Packet Presented NTP timestamp
      SHALL be ignored by the receiver.</t>

      <t>Block Length: 16 bits. This field indicates the length of the block
      in 32 bit words minus one and is set to 7, as this RTCP Block Type has a
      fixed length.</t>

      <t>Payload Type (PT): 7 bits. This field identifies the format of the
      media payload, according to <xref target="RFC3551"/>. This is the
      payload type of the RTP packet reported upon. The PT field is needed in
      the case where the MSAS is neither the Media Server nor a receiver of
      the media stream, i.e. it is implemented as a third-part entity. In such
      cases, the MSAS needs the PT to determine the rate of advancement of the
      timestamps of the RTP media stream to be able to relate reports from
      different SCs on different RTP timestamp values.</t>

      <t>Reserved bits (Resrv): 25 bits. These bits are reserved for future
      use and SHALL be set to 0 at transmission and MUST be ignored by the
      receiver.</t>

      <t>Media Stream Correlation Identifier: 32 bits. This identifier is used
      to correlate synchronized media streams. The value 0 (all bits are set
      "0") indicates that this field is empty. The value 2^32-1 (all bits are
      set "1") is reserved for future use. If the RTCP Packet Sender is an SC
      (SPST=1), then the Media Stream Correlation Identifier field contains
      the Synchronization Group Identifier (SyncGroupId) to which the report
      applies.</t>

      <t>SSRC: 32 bits. The SSRC of the media source is set to the value of
      the SSRC identifier carried in the RTP header <xref target="RFC3550"/>
      of the RTP packet to which the XR IDMS relates.</t>

      <t>Packet Received NTP timestamp: 64 bits. This timestamp reflects the
      wall clock time at the moment of arrival of the first octet of the RTP
      packet to which the XR IDMS relates. It is formatted based on the NTP
      timestamp format as specified in [RFC5905]. See <xref target="timing"/>
      for more information on how this field is used.</t>

      <t>Packet Received RTP timestamp: 32 bits. This timestamp has the value
      of the RTP timestamp carried in the RTP header <xref target="RFC3550"/>
      of the RTP packet to which the XR IDMS relates. Several consecutive RTP
      packets will have equal timestamps if they are (logically) generated at
      once, e.g., belong to the same video frame. It may well be the case that
      one receiver reports on the first RTP packet having a certain RTP
      timestamp and a second receiver reports on the last RTP packet having
      that same RTP timestamp. This would lead to an error in the
      synchronization algorithm due to the faulty interpretation of
      considering both reports to be on the same RTP packet. When reporting on
      an RTP packet which is one of several consecutive RTP packets having
      equal timestamps, an SC SHOULD report on the RTP packet it received with
      the lowest sequence number. Note that with 'lowest sequence number' here
      is meant the first in the sequence of RTP packets just received, not
      from an earlier time before the last wrap-around of RTP timestamps
      (unless this wrap-around occurs during the sequence with equal RTP
      timestamps).</t>

      <t>Packet Presented NTP timestamp: 32 bits. This timestamp reflects the
      wall clock time at the moment the rendered media unit (e.g. video frame
      or audio sample) contained in the first byte of the associated RTP
      packet is presented to the user. It is based on the time format used by
      NTP and consists of the least significant 16 bits of the NTP seconds
      part and the most significant 16 bits of the NTP fractional second part.
      If no Packet Presented NTP timestamp is available, this field SHALL be
      set to 0 and be considered empty and the Packet Presented NTP timestamp
      flag (P) SHALL be set to 0. With regards to NTP epoch and rollover, the
      value of the Packet Presented NTP timestamp is considered to always be
      greater than the Packet Received NTP Timestamp and to be within 2^16
      seconds of it. Presented in this context means the moment the data is
      played out to the user of the system, i.e. sound played out through
      speakers, video images being displayed on some display, etc. The
      accuracy resulting from the synchronization algorithm will only be as
      good as the accuracy with which the SCs can determine the delay between
      receiving packets and presenting them to the end-user.</t>

      <t>The first 64 bits form the header of the RTCP Packet Type, as defined
      in <xref target="RFC3550"/>. The SSRC of packet sender identifies the
      sender of the specific RTCP packet.</t>

      <t>The RTCP IDMS packet consists of 7 32-bit words, with the following
      fields:</t>

      <t>PT: To be determined upon registration with IANA, inserted by the RFC
      Editor upon registration with IANA.</t>

      <t>SSRC: 32 bits. The SSRC of the media source is set to the value of
      the SSRC identifier of the media source carried in the RTP header <xref
      target="RFC3550"/> of the RTP packet to which the RTCP IDMS packet
      relates.</t>

      <t>Media Stream Correlation Identifier: 32 bits. This identifier is used
      to correlate synchronized media streams. The value 0 (all bits are set
      "0") indicates that this field is empty. The value 2^32-1 (all bits are
      set "1") is reserved for future use. The Media Stream Correlation
      Identifier contains the SyncGroupId of the group to which this packet is
      sent.</t>

      <t>Packet Received NTP timestamp: 64 bits. This timestamp reflects the
      wall clock time at the reference client at the moment it received the
      first octet of the RTP packet to which this packet relates. It can be
      used by the synchronization algorithm on the receiving SC to adjust its
      playout timing in order to achieve synchronization, e.g. to set the
      required playout delay. The timestamp is formatted based on the NTP
      timestamp format as specified in <xref target="RFC5905"/>. See <xref
      target="timing"/> for more information on how this field is used.
      Because RTP timestamps do wrap around, the sender of this packet MUST
      use recent values, i.e. choose NTP timestamps that reflect current time
      and not too far in the future or in the past so as to create ambiguity
      with regards to RTP timestamp wrap around.</t>

      <t>Packet Received RTP timestamp: 32 bits. This timestamp has the value
      of the RTP timestamp carried in the RTP header <xref target="RFC3550"/>
      of the RTP packet to which the XR IDMS relates. This SHOULD relate to
      the first arriving RTP packet containing this particular RTP timestamp,
      in case multiple RTP packets contain the same RTP timestamp.</t>

      <t>Packet Presented NTP timestamp: 64 bits. This timestamp reflects the
      wall clock time at the reference client at the moment it presented the
      rendered media unit (e.g. video frame or audio sample) contained in the
      first octet of the associated RTP packet to the user. The timestamp is
      formatted based on the NTP timestamp format as specified in <xref
      target="RFC5905"/>. If no Packet Presented NTP timestamp is available,
      this field SHALL be set to 0 and be considered empty. This field MAY be
      left empty if none or only one of the receivers reported on presentation
      timestamps. Presented here means the moment the data is played out to
      the user of the system.</t>

      <t>In some use cases (e.g. phased array transducers), the level of
      control an MSAS might need to have over the exact moment of playout is
      so precise that a 32bit Presented Timestamp will not suffice. For this
      reason, this RTCP Packet Type for IDMS includes a 64bit Presented
      Timestamp field. Since an MSAS will in practice always add some extra
      delay to the delay reported by the most lagged receiver (to account for
      packet jitter), it suffices for the IDMS XR Block Type with which the
      SCs report on their playout to have a 32bit Presented Timestamp
      field.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="timing" title="Timing and NTP Considerations">
      <t>To achieve IDMS, the different receivers involved need synchronized
      (wall) clocks as a common timeline for synchronization. This
      synchronized clock is used for reporting the Packet Received NTP
      Timestamps and the Packet Presented NTP Timestamp, and for
      interpretation of these fields in received IDMS reports. Depending on
      the synchronization accuracy required, different clock synchronization
      methods can be used. For social TV, synchronization accuracy should be
      achieved on the order of hundreds of milliseconds. In that case, correct
      use of NTP on receivers will in most situations achieve the required
      accuracy. As a guideline, to deal with clock drift of receivers,
      receivers should synchronize their clocks at the beginning of a
      synchronized session. In case of high required accuracy, the
      synchronized clocks of different receivers should not drift beyond the
      accuracy required for the synchronization mechanism. In practice, this
      can mean that receivers need to synchronize their clocks repeatedly
      during a synchronization session.</t>

      <t>Because of the stringent synchronization requirements for achieving
      good audio quality in some use cases, a high accuracy will be needed. In
      this case, use of the global NTP system may not be sufficient. For
      improved accuracy, a local NTP server could be set up, or some other
      more accurate clock synchronization mechanism can be used, such as GPS
      time or the Precision Time Protocol <xref target="IEEE-1588"/>.</t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-avtcore-clksrc"/> defines a set of SDP
      parameters for signaling the clock synchronization source or sources
      available to and used by the individual receivers. SCs MAY use this
      draft to indicate their clock synchronization source or sources in use
      and available. Using these parameters, an SC can indicate which
      synchronization source is being used at the moment, the last time the SC
      synchronized with this source and the synchronization frequency. An SC
      can also indicate any other synchronization sources available to it.
      This allows multiple SCs in an IDMS session to use the same or a similar
      clock source for their session.</t>

      <t>Applications performing IDMS may or may not be able to choose a
      synchronization method for the system clock, because this may be a
      system-wide setting which the application cannot change. How
      applications deal with this is up to the implementation. The application
      might control the system clock, or it might use a separate application
      clock or even a separate IDMS session clock. It might also report on the
      system clock and the synchronization method used, without being able to
      change it.</t>

      <t><xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-leap-seconds"/> presents some guidelines
      on how RTP senders and receivers should deal with leap seconds. When
      relying on NTP for clock synchronization, IDMS is particularly sensitive
      to leap second induced timing discrepancies. It is RECOMMENDED to take
      the guidelines specified in <xref target="I-D.draft-ietf-leap-seconds"/>
      into account when implementing IDMS.</t>

    <section anchor="presentation_timestamps"
             title="On the use of presentation timestamps">
      <t>A receiver can report on different timing events, i.e. on packet
      arrival times and on playout or presentation times. A receiver SHALL
      report on arrival times and a receiver MAY report on playout times. RTP
      packet arrival times are relatively easy to report on. Normally, the
      processing and playout of the same media stream by different receivers
      will take roughly the same amount of time. Synchronizing on packet
      arrival times, may lead to some accuracy loss, but it will be adequate
      for many applications, such as social TV.</t>

      <t>Also, if the receivers are in some way controlled, e.g. having the
      same buffer settings, decoding and rendering times, high accuracy can be
      achieved. However, if all receivers in a synchronization session have
      the ability to report on, and thus synchronize on, actual playout times,
      or packet presentation times, this may be more accurate. It is up to
      applications and implementations of this RTCP extension whether to
      implement and use this.</t>

    <section anchor="sdp_rtcp"
             title="SDP Signalling for RTCP IDMS Packet Type">
      <t>The SDP attribute rtcp-idms is used to signal the use of the RTCP
      IDMS Packet Type for IDMS and the associated RTCP XR Block for IDMS. It
      is also used to carry an identifier of the synchronization group to
      which clients belong or will belong. The SDP attribute is used as a
      media-level attribute during session setup. This means that in case of
      multiple related streams, IDMS is performed on one of them. The other
      streams will be synchronized to this reference or master stream using
      existing inter-stream synchronization (i.e. lip-sync) solutions, i.e.
      using Sender Reports based on a common clock source. Basic guidelines
      for choosing the media stream for IDMS is to choose audio above video,
      as humans are more sensitive to degradation in audio quality than in
      video quality. When using multi-description or multi-view codecs, the
      IDMS control should be performed on the base layer.</t>

      <t>This SDP attribute is defined as follows, using Augmented Backus-Naur
      Form <xref target="RFC5234"/>.</t>

      <t>rtcp-idms = "a=" "rtcp-idms" ":" sync-grp CRLF</t>

      <t>sync-grp = "sync-group=" SyncGroupId</t>

      <t>SyncGroupId = 1*10DIGIT ; Decimal value from 0 through 4294967294</t>

      <t>DIGIT = %x30-39</t>

      <t>SyncGroupId is a 32-bit unsigned integer and represented in decimal.
      SyncGroupId identifies a group of SCs for IDMS. The value SyncGroupId=0
      represents an empty SyncGroupId. The value 4294967295 (2^32-1) is
      reserved for future use. For a description on the value of SyncGroupId
      to include, see <xref target="sdp_rules"/>.</t>

      <t>The following is an example of the SDP attribute for IDMS.</t>

      <t>a=rtcp-idms:sync-group=42</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sdp_rules" title="SDP rules">
      <t/>

      <section title="Offer/Answer rules">
        <t>The SDP usage for IDMS follows the rules defined in <xref
        target="RFC4566"/> and section 5 of <xref target="RFC3611"/> on SDP
        signalling, with the exception of what is stated here. The IDMS usage
        of RTCP is a (loosely coupled) collaborative attribute, in the sense
        that receivers send their status information and, in response, the
        MSAS (asynchronously) sends synchronization setting instructions. The
        rtcp-idms attribute thus indicates the ability to send and receive
        indicated RTCP messages. This section defines how this SDP attribute
        should be used with regard to an offer/answer context.</t>

        <t>It is expected that, in most cases, the rtcp-idms attribute will be
        used in an offer/answer context where receivers will have
        pre-determined, through some means outside the scope of this document,
        a SyncGroupId before the media session is setup. However, it is also
        supported that the MSAS assigns such a SyncGroupId, for example if the
        MSAS contains group management functionality. Thus, both the MSAS and
        the SCs can insert the attribute and the SyncGroupId. Furthermore, it
        is allowed to insert the attribute for more than one media stream,
        allowing an SC to become part of multiple synchronization groups
        simultaneously. This effectively couples two (or more) synchronization
        groups to each other. If the rtcp-idms attribute is inserted more than
        once for a particular media session, each SyncGroupId SHALL only be
        inserted once.</t>

        <t>In order to join an IDMS session, the receiver (the SC) inserts the
        rtcp-idms attribute as a media level attribute in the SDP offer. This
        SDP offer can be an initial offer, if the media session is starting as
        a synchronized session. The SDP offer can also be an update to an
        existing media session, converting the session to an IDMS session. If
        the receiver has a pre-determined SyncGroupId value, it SHOULD use
        this value for setting the SyncGroupId parameter in the rtcp-idms
        attribute. If the receiver does not know the SyncGroupId to be used,
        it MAY leave the SyncGroupId parameter empty by setting its value to
        0.</t>

        <t>The MSAS SHALL include the rtcp-idms attribute in its answer. If
        the value of the SyncGroupId parameter in the offer was not empty (not
        equal to 0), the MSAS SHOULD NOT change the SyncGroupId in its answer.
        If the SyncGroupId was empty, the MSAS SHALL include the proper
        SyncGroupId in its answer. If the MSAS receives an offer with the
        value of the SyncGroupId parameter set to 0, and cannot determine the
        proper SyncGroupId, it SHALL remove the attribute from its answer.</t>

        <t>An MSAS receiving an SDP offer without the rtcp-idms attribute can
        also decide that IDMS is applicable to that media session. In such a
        case, the MSAS MAY insert the rtcp-idms attribute, including a
        non-empty SyncGroupId, as part of its answer.</t>

        <t>A receiver receiving an rtcp-idms attribute as part of the SDP
        answer from an MSAS, SHALL start sending IDMS XR reports (following
        all the normal RTCP rules for sending RTCP XR blocks) and SHALL be
        ready to start receiving IDMS Settings. As usual, if a receiver does
        not support the attribute (e.g. in case of an MSAS-inserted IDMS
        attribute), it SHALL ignore the attribute.</t>

        <t>Different updates are applicable to such an IDMS session. Updates
        can be sent ommitting the rtcp-idms attribute, thereby ending the
        (involvement in) the synchronization session. Updates can also be sent
        including the rtcp-idms attribute, but with a different SyncGroupId.
        This indicates a switch in synchronization group. Updates can also be
        sent including another rtcp-idms attribute, indicating a membership of
        another synchronization group, effectively merging the current
        group(s) with the new one.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Declarative cases">
        <t>In certain situations, there is no offer/answer context, but only a
        declarative modus. In this case, the MSAS just inserts the rtcp-idms
        attribute and a valid SyncGroupId. Any receiver receiving the
        rtcp-idms attribute in such a declarative case SHALL start sending
        IDMS XR Report Blocks and SHALL be ready to start receiving RTCP IDMS
        Settings packets.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations described in <xref target="RFC3611"/>
      apply to this document as well.</t>

      <t>The RTCP XR IDMS Report Block defined in this document is used to
      collect, summarize and distribute information on packet reception- and
      playout-times of streaming media. The information may be used to
      orchestrate the media playout at multiple devices.</t>

      <t>Errors in the information, either accidental or malicious, may lead
      to undesired behavior. For example, if one device erroneously or
      maliciously reports a two-hour delayed playout, then another device in
      the same synchronization group could decide to delay its playout by two
      hours as well, in order to keep its playout synchronized. A user would
      likely interpret this two hour delay as a malfunctioning service.</t>

      <t>Therefore, the application logic of both SCs and MSASs should check
      for out-of-bound information. Differences in playout time exceeding
      configured limits (e.g. more than ten seconds) could be an indication of
      such out-of-bound information.</t>

      <t>Apart from checking for out-of-bound information in the end-points,
      an IDMS implementation can reduce its vulnerability to attacks by
      including source authentication and message integrity measures, reducing
      the potential for man-in-the-middle attacks. <xref
      target="I-D.draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-security-options"/> provides an
      overview of the security options in RTP environments, and includes a set
      of recommendations for message integrity and source authentication which
      are applicable to IDMS. In addition to preventing man-in-the-middle
      attacks from inserting erroneous IDMS Reports, the message
      confidentiality mechanisms outlined in <xref
      target="I-D.draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-security-options"/> also prevent
      third parties from determining that two or more end hosts are receiving
      the same stream by looking at the Media Stream Correlation
      Identifier.</t>

      <t>Apart from attacking an IDMS session directly by sending incorrect
      IDMS Reports, and with it introducing delays for all devices in a
      synchronization group, another potential vulnerability comes from the
      used clock synchronization method. Should an attacker succeed in
      adjusting an SC's wallclock, that SC will report incorrect IDMS Reports.
      In order to prevent such clock synchronization attacks, it is
      recommended to use a secure time synchronization service. </t>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document defines a new RTCP packet type, the RTCP IDMS Packet
      (IDMS Settings), within the existing Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
      (IANA) registry of RTCP Control Packet Types. This document also defines
      a new RTCP XR Block Type, the IDMS XR Report Block, within the existing
      IANA registry of RTCP Extended Reports (RTCP XR) Block Types.</t>

      <t>Further, this document defines a new SDP attribute "rtcp-idms" within
      the existing IANA registry of SDP Parameters, part of the "att-field
      (media level only)". Finally, this document defines a new IANA registry
      subordinate to the IANA RTCP Extended Reports (RTCP XR) Block Type
      Registry: the IDMS XR Block SPST Registry.</t>

      <section title="RTCP IDMS Packet Type">
        <t>This document assigns the packet type value TBD in the IANA 'RTCP
        Control Packet types (PT) Registry' to the RTCP IDMS Packet Type.</t>

        Packet Type value for this packet type, both in this section as well
        as in the figure and text in Section 8]</t>

        <t>[Note to RFC Editor: this block type value is currently assigned to
        <xref target="TS183063"/>. This document replaces <xref
        target="TS183063"/> as the normative specification of the RTCP XR IDMS
        Report Block. Upon publication of this document as RFC, <xref
        target="TS183063"/> will be changed to reflect this.</t>

        <t>The RTCP XR IDMS Report Block contains an extensible SPST value
        field and therefore a new registry for this field is required. This
        new registry is defined in <xref target="spst-reg"/>.</t>

        <t>In accordance with <xref target="RFC5226"/>, a Designated Expert
        will review any applications made to IANA for the registry. Primary
        criteria for the Designated Expert to use when reviewing new
