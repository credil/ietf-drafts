              MPLS-TP protection for interconnected rings
          draft-liu-mpls-tp-interconnected-ring-protection-00

Abstract

   According to the ring protection Requirements in RFC 5654,
   Requirement 93 : When a network is constructed from interconnected
   rings, MPLS-TP MUST support recovery mechanisms that protect user
   data that traverses more than one ring.  This includes the
   possibility of failure of the ring-interconnect nodes and links,so
   this document will describle all kinds of interconnected rings
   Scenario and a few possible solutions for recovery the failure of the
   ring-interconnect nodes and Links. .


   This document is a product of a joint Internet Task Force(IETF) /
   International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as
   defined by the ITU-T.

1.  Introduction

   This first version of the document will simply describle all kinds of
   interconnected rings scenario and a few protection solutions for the
   failure of the ring-interconnect nodes and links.  For interconnected
   rings between two rings, there are mainly include three common
   interconnection scenario:

   Dual-node interconnection - when the interconnected rings are
   interconnected by two nodes from each ring (see Figure 1);

   Single-node interconnection - when the connection between the
   interconnected rings are through a single node (see Figure 2);

   Chain of rings - when a series of rings are connected through
   interconnection nodes that are part of both interconnected rings (see
   Figure 3)

   when a traffic traveres more than two rings.there are mainly the
   following mix interconnection scenarios:

   Dual-node and single-node mix interconnection-when there not only
   exist two interconnected rings are interconnected by two nodes from
   each ring. but also there exist two interconnected rings are
   interconnected by single node( see figure 5);

   Dual-node and chained mix interconnection-when there exist two
   interconnnected rings are interconnected by two nodes from each ring.
   in addtion, there still exist two interconnnected rings are
   interconnected by a common chained link(see figure 4);

   single-node and chained mix interconnection-when there exist two
   interconnected rings are interconnected by single node, in addtion,
   there still exist two interconnected rings are interconnected by a
   common chained link(see figure 6);

   Dual-node, single-node and chained mix interconnection-when there
   exist all three interconnection scenrios in the network domain
   including Dual-node interconnnection, single-node interconnection and

   For a multi-ring service, it will be accross more than one ring just
   like above seven scenrios. if a failur happens on a multi-ring path,
   quickly recovery is necessary requirement for MPLS-TP network, so
   there are describles for recoverying the failure in the multi-ring
   interconnection sencrios in the following sections .

3.  recovery mechanisms

   This section will describle recovery mechanisms that protect multi-
   ring traffics,which traver more than one ring in case of failure for
   all kinds of interconnection-ring scenrios;

3.1.  recovery mechanism for Dual-node interconnected-ring

   Under the interconnected-ring scenrios just as figure 1,multi-ring
   traffics will be transported by interconnection link(LSR C-LSR 6).
   when a failure happened on the interconnection link, if a segment
   protection path has been set up for the interconnection link , maybe
   apply 1:1 linear protection to protect the interconnection link
   faiure for interconnected-ring; or else, it maybe need end to end
   multi-ring path switch to protect the interconnection link failure. .

3.2.  recovery mechanism for Single-node interconnected-ring

   for the single-node interconnected-ring scenrio, As the
   interconnection node (LSR-A in Figure 2) is a single-point of failure
   , such an interconnection scheme should be avoided. .

3.3.  recovery mechanism for Chained interconnected-ring

   For the chained interconnected-ring scenrio, if the interconnection
   nodes(LSR-A and LSR-F) or the shared link(LSR-A-LSR-F) have failures,
   single ring protection solution can't recovery the failure, so the
   affected multi-ring traffics maybe be protected by end to end
   protection path; .

3.4.  recovery mechanism for Dual-node and Single-node mix
      interconnected-ring

   for the mix interconnected-ring scenrios, each interconnection nodes
   or shared interconnection link will be protected by setting up
   segment protection path seperately. in addition, it may still use end
   to end multi-ring protection path to protect multiple interconnection
   nodes or shared interconnection link failure. .

3.5.  recovery mechanism for Dual-node and Chained mix interconnected-
      ring

   . for the mix interconnected-ring scenrios, each interconnection
   nodes or shared interconnection link will be protected by setting up
   segment protection path seperately. in addition, it may still use end
   to end multi-ring protection path to protect multiple interconnection
   nodes or shared interconnection link failure.

3.6.  recovery mechanism for Single-node and Chained mix interconnected-
      ring

   for the mix interconnected-ring scenrios, each interconnection nodes
   or shared interconnection link will be protected by setting up
   segment protection path seperately. in addition, it may still use end
   to end multi-ring protection path to protect multiple interconnection
   nodes or shared interconnection link failure.

3.7.  recovery mechanism for Dual-node ,Single-node and Chained mix
      interconnected-ring

   for the mix interconnected-ring scenrios, each interconnection nodes
   or shared interconnection link will be protected by setting up
   segment protection path seperately. in addition, it may still use end
   to end multi-ring protection path to protect multiple interconnection
   nodes or shared interconnection link failure.
