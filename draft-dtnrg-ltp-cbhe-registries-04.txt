Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP), Compressed Bundle Header Encoding
              (CBHE), and Bundle Protocol IANA Registries
                   draft-dtnrg-ltp-cbhe-registries-04

Abstract

   The DTNRG research group has defined the experimental Licklider
   Transmission Protocol (LTP) [RFC5326] and the Compressed Bundle
   Header Encoding (CBHE) [RFC6260] mechanism for the 'ipn' URI scheme.
   Finally, RFC5050 [RFC5050] defines values for the Bundle
   Administrative Record Type.  All of these describe fields that are
   subject to a registry.  For the purpose of its research work, the
   group has created ad-hoc registries.  As the specifications are
   stable and have multiple interoperable implementations, the group
   would like to hand off the registries to IANA for official custody.
   This document describes the actions needed to be executed by IANA.

1.  Introduction

   The DTNRG research group has defined the Licklider Transmission
   Protocol (LTP)[RFC5326].  LTP contains certain fields that are
   subject to a registry.  For the purpose of its research work, the
   group has created ad-hoc registries.  As the specifications are
   stable and have multiple interoperable implementations, the group
   would like to hand off the registries to IANA for official custody.
   This document describes the actions needed to be executed by IANA
   [RFC5226].

   The Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE) [RFC6260] specification
   defines the concepts of Node Number and Service Number in the 'ipn'
   URI scheme.  In this document we request formation of an IANA
   registry for the Node Number field in the 'ipn' scheme.

   Because of its association with space communication and the
   Consultative Committee on Space Data Systems [CCSDS], a portion of
   the CBHE Node Number space and a corresponding portion of the LTP
   Engine ID space is delegated by this document to the CCSDS Space
   Assigned Numbers Authority [SANA].  SANA functions similarly to IANA
   in that it maintains registries of managed values, with a focus on
   values used by protocols used by CCSDS member agencies.


2.  Licklider Transmission Protocol

   The Licklider Transmission Protocol has fields requiring registries
   managed by IANA.  This document requests the creation of the three
   registries in this section and that they be associated with the other
   registries for the Licklider Transmission protocol.

2.1.  LTP Cancel Segment Reason Codes

   Section 3.2.4 of [RFC5326] defines the reason codes that may be
   present in Cancel Segments in the LTP protocol.

   The registration policy for this registry is: RFC Required

   The initial values(as defined by RFC5326) for the LTP Cancel Segment
   Reason Codes registry shall be:

2.2.  LTP Engine ID

   The Licklider Transmission Protocol has an LTP Engine ID field
   (section 2 of [RFC5326]).  An IANA registry shall be set up as
   follows.

   The registration policy for this registry is:

   1 -- (2**14)-1  Expert review required.  The designated experts for
      the review are the chairs of the IRTF DTN Research Group (dtnrg)
      if the dtnrg is extant, or as determined by the IRSG.

   (2**14) -- (2**21)-1  Allocated to the Space Assigned Numbers
      Authority ([SANA]) for use by Consultative Committee for Space
      Data Systems (CCSDS) missions.

   (2**21) -- (2**28)-1  Private or experimental use.  No assignment by
      IANA.

   (2**28) -- (2**42)-1  First-come, First-Served basis for requests for
      less than or equal to 2**14 values to a single entity or
      organization.  Expert review for requests of more than 2**14
      values to a single entity or organization.  The designated experts
      for the review are the chairs of the IRTF DTN Research Group
      (dtnrg) if the dtnrg is extant, or as determined by the IRSG.

   The LTP Engine ID is expressed as a Self-Delimiting Numeric Value
   (SDNV) in the LTP protocol and no maximum is specified in the
   protocol definition.  SDNVs are described inSection 4.1 of the Bundle
   Protocol in [RFC5050] and are also described in the stand-alone
   document [RFC6256].  The initial values for the LTP Engine Numbers
   registry shall be:

2.3.  LTP Client Service ID

   The Licklider Transmission Protocol has a client service ID number
   field (section 3.2.1 of [RFC5326]).  An IANA registry shall be set up
   as follows.

3.2.  CBHE Service Numbers

   The Compressed Bundle Header Enoding specification defnes a Service
   Number (service-nbr) field (section 2.1 of [RFC6260]).  An IANA

   the addition of an additional registry titled 'Bundle Administrative
   Record Type' be added to the list of registries associated with the
   Bundle Protcol.

   The registration policy for this registry is:RFC required

   The initial values for the Bundle Administrative Record Type registry
