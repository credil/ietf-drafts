               Secure Internet Group Management Protocol
                       draft-atwood-pim-sigmp-00

Abstract

   This document specifies a Secure Internet Group Management Protocol
   (SIGMP), which is an extension to IGMP to enforce receiver access
   control for secured multicast groups.  In SIGMP, only the hosts
   operated by authorized end users are permitted to report their
   interest in secured groups.  IPsec is used to filter the messages
   that report or query the interest in secured groups.  SIGMP provides
   two working modes that are fully compatible with IGMP v2 and IGMP v3
   respectively.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is used by IPv4 systems
   (hosts and routers) to report their IP multicast group memberships to
   any neighboring multicast routers.  There are two popular versions:
   IGMP v2, as specified in [RFC2236] and IGMP v3, as specified in
   [RFC3376].  However, both versions establish a fully "open" multicast
   network, where any host can join any multicast group as a recipient
   without receiver access control.

   This document specifies a Secure Internet Group Management Protocol
   (SIGMP) working in a "hybrid" multicast network.  In a hybrid
   network, multicast groups are classified into two categories: open
   groups and secured groups.  Open groups refer to multicast groups
   that any host can join unconditionally as a receiver.  Secured groups
   refer to multicast groups with receiver access control, e.g., only
   hosts operated by authenticated and authorized end users are
   permitted to join as receivers.  SIGMP retains most mechanisms of
   IGMP and enforces receiver access control to secured groups in a
   multicast network.  On the one hand, any host could report its

   interest in open groups freely as in IGMP.  On the other hand, only
   hosts operated by the authenticated and authorized end users are
   permitted to report their interest in secured groups.

   Instead of a new specific mechanism, SIGMP uses IPsec [RFC4301] to
   implement receiver access control to secured groups at the IP layer.
   Some Security Associations (SAs) are created to secure the SIGMP
   packets that are used to report or query secured groups.  The packets
   coming from the unauthorized hosts will be discarded by the IPsec
   subsystem if they are used to report or query interest in secured
   groups.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the defining documents
   for IGMP [RFC2236] and [RFC3376].  Unless otherwise noted, terms
   defined in these documents are used with the same meaning in this
   one.

   In addition, the following terms are used in this document.

   open group: A multicast group without receiver access control.  Any
   host can unconditionally join any open group as a receiver, e.g. the
   data in a open group can be received by any host.

   secured group: A multicast group with receiver access control.  Only
   hosts operated by authenticated and authorized end users are
   permitted to join a secured group as a receiver, e.g. the data in a
   secured group can only be received by hosts operated by authenticated
   and authorized end users.

1.2.  Assumptions

   In order to focus on the actions of group membership (e.g., joining
   and leaving groups), the following topics are assumed to be discussed
   elsewhere:

   1.  how to distinguish between secured groups and open groups;

   2.  how to authenticate and authorize the operators of the devices
       (hosts and routers);

Internet-Draft                    SIGMP                    November 2013


   3.  how to distribute the necessary Security Associations to
       participant devices (hosts and routers).

   The existence of the group property (secured or open) defines the
   hybrid nature of the environment in which SIGMP works.  A variety of
   existing protocols (e.g., LDAP) can be used to enquire as to the
   status of a particular multicast group.

   The hosts that show interest in secured groups MUST be operated by
   authenticated and authorized end users.  One approach to the task of
   authentication and authorization of end users is based on the use of
   PANA [RFC5191] and EAP [RFC3748], and is described in
   [I-D.atwood-mboned-mrac-req], [I-D.atwood-mboned-mrac-arch] and
   draft-atwood-mboned-pana (not yet published).

   A coordination protocol may be needed to manage and distribute the
   Security Associations (SAs) for secured groups among the routers and
   the hosts that correspond to authenticated and authorized end users.
   One set of possible procedures for SA creation and maintenance is
   specified in draft-atwood-pim-gsam (not yet published).

2.  Overview of SIGMP

   SIGMP is an extension to IGMP and performs receiver access control
   for groups in a multicast network.  It retains most mechanisms of
   IGMP and has two working modes: 1) mode compatible with IGMP v2 and
   2) mode compatible with IGMP v3.  It works in either mode and is
   transparent for hosts that support IGMP, but not SIGMP.  In addition,
   SIGMP uses IPsec to secure part of its packets.  For an open group,
   it delivers the data to any host unconditionally as IGMP does.
   However, for a secured group, SIGMP only delivers the data to the
   hosts that have established SAs in the IPsec subsystem in order to
   perform access control.

   In a network segment, hosts show their interest in secured groups
   using IPsec protected packets although their interest for open groups
   is still reported using unprotected packets.  Similarly, routers
   query the membership interest for a secured group using IPsec
   protected packets, although the general query and the query for the
   membership of open groups are performed using unprotected packets.

   In general, the packets in SIGMP are classified into four categories,
   which are Query for Open Group (OGQ), Query for Secured Group (SGQ),
   Report for Open Group (OGR) and Report for Secured Group (SGR).  OGQ
   and SGQ are sent by the the Querier and are used to learn the
   membership of open groups (or all groups for general query) and
   secured groups respectively.  In detail, OGQ includes general query,
   specific-group query for open group and group-and-source-specific

   query for the source of open group.  SGQ includes specific-group
   query for secured group and group-and-source-specific query for the
   source of secured group.  OGR and SGR are sent by hosts and used to
   report the membership of open groups and secured groups respectively.
   In detail, OGR includes report to specific-group query for open
   group, report to group-and-source-specific query for the source of
   open group, unsolicited report for open group and part of reports to
   general query.  SGR includes report to specific-group query for
   secured group, report to group-and-source-specific query for the
   source of secured group, unsolicited report for secured group and
   part of reports to general query.  SGQ and SGR are protected by IPsec
   at IP layer while OGQ and OGR are delivered without IPsec protection.

   The destination address of packets in IP layer is specified as
   follows.  In SGQ and SGR, the destination address is a secured group
   address.  In OGQ, it is 224.0.0.1 if the packet is general query and
   otherwise it is an open group address.  In OGR, it is 224.0.0.22 if
   the packet is the report to general query compatible with IGMP v3 and
   otherwise it is an open group address.  The two addresses of
   224.0.0.1 and 224.0.0.22 are the open group addresses.  NOTE: When
   SIGMP works in the mode compatible with IGMP v3, the response to a
   general query contains zero or one OGR and zero or more SGR.  It is
   described in detail in Section 5.2.1.

3.  Packet Format

   The packet format of SIGMP is identical to the packet format for
   IGMP.  In detail, the format is the same as IGMP v2 when SIGMP works
   in the mode compatible with IGMP v2.  The format is the same as IGMP
   v3 when SIGMP works in the mode compatible with IGMP v3.

4.  Router Operations

   Router operations in SIGMP are based on router operations in IGMP.
   However, some additional operations must be appended since access
   control to secured groups is extended into SIGMP.  This section
   describes the additional operations for the two working modes.

4.1.  Router Operations Compatible with IGMP v2

   The additional router operations focus on the operations for a
   received report.

4.1.1.  Router Operations for a Received Report

   On receiving a report, a router checks the group address in the
   received report.  If the group address indicates an open group, the
   report is considered as an OGR.  A router will process an OGR as it
   does that in IGMP v2 directly.  Otherwise, the received report is an
   SGR that SHOULD just have been authenticated (and decrypted) by the
   IPsec subsystem (e.g., AH [RFC4302]).  For SGR, a router must perform
   two verifications: address consistency and SA existence.

   In the address consistency verification, a router compares two
   addresses: the group address in the SIGMP report and the destination
   address in the IP header.  The verification fails if the two
   addresses are not the same.  In the failure case, the sender of the
   IGMP Report has attempted to hide a request for a specific group
   (probably a secured group) in an IGMP Report for a different group
   (probably an open group).  This will cause the IPsec subsystem to
   deliver the IGMP Report without requiring it to be protected.
   Therefore a router must discard the report if this address
   consistency verification fails.

   In the SA existence verification, a router checks whether SAs have
   been established for the secured group whose address is contained in
   the received report.  The verification fails if there are no valid
   SAs for the group in the router's IPsec subsystem.  Since the IPsec
   subsystem is used to enforce the access control, no access to a
   secured group is permitted until its SAs have been established.
   Therefore a router must discard the report if this verification
   fails.

   If the two verifications succeed on SGR, a router will proceed to
   update the group memberships and refresh the timers as it does in
   IGMP v2.  In summary, the router operations for a received report are
   shown in Table 1.

                          Compatible with IGMP v2

4.2.  Router Operations Compatible with IGMP v3

   The additional router operations still focus on the operations for a
   received report.  However, there is a little difference between the
   operations in the mode compatible with IGMP v3 and the operations in
   the mode compatible with IGMP v2, since the formats of received
   reports in the two modes are different.

4.2.1.  Router Operations on a Received Report

   On receiving a report, a router checks the number of group records in
   the report.  If the number is more than one, it indicates that the
   report is an OGR, but not an SGR, since only one group record is
   included in an SGR.  In this case, every group record in the report
   must be verified further as follows.  A router checks the multicast
   address in the group record.  If the multicast address is an open
   group address, a router will process the group record as it does in
   IGMP v3.  Otherwise, a secured group address is in the group record
   and a router must discard the group record.  The OGR including more
   than one group records is not protected by IPsec systems and is not
   permitted to contain any information related to any secured group.

   In contrast, if the number of the group records is just one, a router
   still checks the multicast address in the single group record.  If
   the multicast address indicates an open group address, the received
   report is considered as an OGR and a router will process the group
   record as it does that in IGMP v3 directly.  Otherwise, the received
   report SHOULD be an SGR that SHOULD just be authenticated (and
   decrypted) by the IPsec subsystem.  For the single group record in
   the SGR, a router must perform two verifications, address consistency
   and SA existence, similar to Section 4.1.

   In the address consistency verification, a router compares two
   addresses: the multicast address in the group record of the SIGMP
   report and the destination address in the IP header.  A router must
   discard the report if the two addresses are not the same.

   In SA existence verification, a router checks whether SAs have been
   established for the secured group whose address is contained in the
   group record of the received report.  A router must discard the
   report if there are no SAs established in the router's IPsec
   subsystem.

   If the two verifications succeed on an SGR, a router will proceed to
   update the group memberships and refresh the timers as it does in
   IGMP v3.  In summary, router operations for a received report are
   shown in Table 2.

5.  Host Operations

   Host operations in SIGMP are based on host operations in IGMP.
   However, some additional operations must be appended since access
   control to secured group is extended into SIGMP.  This section
   describes the additional operations for the two working modes.

5.1.  Host Operations Compatible with IGMP v2

   The additional host operations focus on the conditions for
   unsolicited report and the operations for a received query.

5.1.1.  Conditions for Unsolicited Report

   Before creating an unsolicited report, a host must check the reported
   group.  If the report group is open, a host will do as in IGMP v2.
   If secured, a host must continue to check whether SAs have been
   established for the secured group.  If no SA is defined for this
   group address, a host MUST return an error indication to the issuer
   of the request that provoked the unsolicited report.  [[Is this the
   right behavior?]]

5.1.2.  Host Operations for a Received Query

   On receiving the query, a host does the additional operation as a
   router does in Section 4.2.1.

5.2.  Host Operations Compatible with IGMP v3

   The additional host operations focus on three aspects: 1) the
   conditions for unsolicited report, 2) the operations for a received
   non-general query and 3) the operations for a received general query.
   The first two are identical to those described in Section 5.1.1 and
   Section 5.1.2.  In this subsection, only the last case is explained.

5.2.1.  Host Operations for a Received General Query

   When it determines to respond to a general query, a host creates zero
   or one OGR and zero or more SGR in SIGMP instead of one report in
   IGMP v3.  The OGR reports the current state of all the open groups
   that the host is interested in.  Each SGR reports the current state
   of one secured group that the host in interested in.

   At the IP layer, the destination address of OGR is 224.0.0.22.  In
   contrast, at the IP layer the destination addresses of SGRs are the
   secured group addresses.  Since IPsec has established SAs for secured
   groups, SGRs will be protected and the OGR will not.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The protocol number of SIGMP is the same as IGMP.
