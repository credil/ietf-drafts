            A Framework for SDP Attributes when Multiplexing
             draft-nandakumar-mmusic-sdp-mux-attributes-03

Abstract

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) provides mechanisms to
   describe attributes of multimedia sessions and of individual media
   streams (e.g., Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) sessions) within a
   multimedia session.  In the RTCWeb WG, there is a need to use a
   single 5-tuple for sending and receiving media associated with
   multiple media descriptions ("m=" lines).  Such a requirement has
   raised concerns over the semantic implications of the SDP attributes
   associated with the RTP Sessions multiplexed over a single transport
   layer flow.

   The scope of this specification is to provide a framework for
   analyzing the multiplexing characteristics of SDP attributes.  The
   specification also categorizes existing attributes based on the
   framework described herein.

Internet-Draft         SDP Attribute Multiplexing              July 2013


1.  Introduction

   Real-Time Communication Web (RTCWeb) framework requires Real-time
   Transport Protocol as the media transport protocol and Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] for describing and negotiating
   multi-media communication sessions.

   SDP defines several attributes for capturing characteristics that
   apply to the individual media descriptions (described by "m=" lines")
   and the overall multimedia session.  Typically different media types
   (audio, video etc) described using different media descriptions
   represent separate RTP Sessions that are carried over individual
   transport layer flows.  However, in the RTCWeb WG, a requirement has
   arisen to multiplex several RTP Sessions over a single transport
   layer flow.  This in turn has made necessary to understand the
   interpretation and usage of the SDP attributes defined for the
   multiplexed media descriptions.

   Given the number of SDP attributes registered with the IANA [IANA]
   and possibility of new attributes being defined in the future, there
   is need for generic future-proof framework to analyze these
   attributes for their applicability in the transport multiplexing use-
   cases.

   The document starts with providing the motivation for requiring such
   a framework.  This is followed by introduction to the SDP attribute
   analysis framework/procedures, following which several sections
   applies the framework to the SDP attributes registered with the IANA
   [IANA]


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Motivation

   The time and complications of setting up ICE [RFC5245] and DTLS-SRTP
   [RFC5763] transports for use by RTP, and conservation of ports, forms
   an requirement to try and reduce the number of transport level flows
   needed.  This has resulted in the definition of ways, such as,
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation] and
   [I-D.ietf-avt-multiplexing-rtp] to multiplex RTP over a single
   transport flow in order to preserve network resources such as port
   numbers.  This imposes further restrictions on applicability of these

   SDP attributes as they are defined today.

   The specific problem is that there are attribute combinations which
   make sense when specified on independent m-lines -- as with classical
   SDP -- that do not make sense when those m-lines are then multiplexed
   over the same transport.  To give an obvious example, ICE permits
   each m-mline to have an independently specified ice-ufrag attribute.
   However, if the media from multiple m-lines is multiplexed over the
   same ICE component, then the meaning of media-level ice-ufrag
   attributes becomes muddled.

   As of today there are close to 250 SDP attributes registered with the
   IANA [IANA] and more will be added in the future.  There is no
   clearly defined procedure to establish the validity/applicability of
   these attribute when used with transport multiplexing.


4.  SDP Attribute Analysis Framework

   Attributes in an SDP session description can be defined at the
   session-level and media-level.  These attributes could be
   semantically grouped as noted below.

   o  Attributes related to media content such as media type, encoding
      schemes, payload types.
   o  Attributes specifying media transport characteristics like RTP/
      RTCP port numbers, network addresses, QOS.
   o  Metadata description attributes capturing session timing and
      origin information.
   o  Attributes establishing relationships between media streams such
      as grouping framework

   With the above semantic grouping as the reference, the proposed
   framework classifies each attribute into one of the following
   categories:
   NORMAL  Attributes that can be independently specified when
      multiplexing and retain their original semantics.

      In the example given below, the direction and label attributes are
      independently specified for audio and video m=lines.  These
      attributes are not impacted by multiplexing these media streams
      over a single transport layer flow.

   NOT RECOMMENDED  Attributes where multiplexing is not recommended if
      these attributes are in use in the SDP since doing so MAY result
      in incorrect behaviors

      Example: Multiplexing media descriptions having attribute zrtp-
      hash defined with the media descriptions lacking it, would either
      complicate the handling of multiplexed stream or fail
      multiplexing.

   IDENTICAL  Attributes that MUST be identical across all the media
      descriptions being multiplexed.

      Attributes such as rtcp-mux fall into this category.  Since RTCP
      reporting is done per RTP Session, there is no way to receive RTCP
      control data for the video m=line in the example below.  Hence
      rtcp-mux MUST be repeated for the video m=line as well, when
      multiplexed.

   SUM  Attributes can be set as they are normally used but software
      using them in a multiplex case, MUST apply the sum of all the
      attributes being multiplexed instead of trying to use each one.
      This is typically used for bandwidth or other rate limiting
      attributes to the underlining transport.

      The software parsing the SDP sample below, should use the
      aggregate Application Specific (AS) bandwidth value from the
      individual media descriptions to determine the AS value for the
      multiplexed session.  Thus the calculated AS value would be 256+64
      bytes for the given example.

         b=AS:256


   TRANSPORT  Attributes that can be set normally for multiple items in
      a multiplexed group but the software MUST pick just one of the
      attribute of the given type for use.  The one chosen is the
      attribute associated with the "m=" lines that represents the
      information being used for the transport of the RTP.

      In the example below, "a=crypto" attribute is defined for both the
      audio and the video m=lines.The one that MUST be used for the
      multiplexed RTP Session is the one that corresponds to m=line with
      mid "two" even though the audio m=line with mid "one" appears
      ahead of it in the SDP.  This is due to BUNDLE grouping semantics
      [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation] which mandates the values
      from m=line corresponding to the mid appearing first on the
      a=group:BUNDLE line to be considered for setting up the RTP

   SPECIAL  Attributes where the text in the source draft must be
      consulted for further handling when multiplexed.

      As an example, for the attribute extmap, the specification
      defining the extension MUST be referred to understand the
      multiplexing implications.

   TBD  This category defines attributes that need more information to
      assign an appropriate category.




   The idea behind these categories is to provide recommendations for
   using the attributes under RTP session multiplexing scenarios.

   Section 5 analyzes attributes listed in IANA [IANA] grouped under the
   IETF document that defines them.  The "Current" column indicates
   whether the attribute is currently specified as:

   o  S -- Session level
   o  M -- Media level
   o  B -- Both
   o  SR -- Source-level (for a single SSRC)

5.4.  RFC4574 - SDP Label Attribute

   RFC4574 [RFC4574] defines a new Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   media-level attribute: "label".  The "label" attribute carries a
   pointer to a media stream in the context of an arbitrary network
   application that uses SDP.  The sender of the SDP document can attach
   the "label" attribute to a particular media stream or streams.  The
   application can then use the provided pointer to refer to each
   particular media stream in its context.

                        RFC5762 Attribute Analysis

   If RFC 6773 is being used in addition to RFC 5762 and provided that
   DCCP-in-UDP layer has additional demultiplexing, then it may be
   possible to use different DCCP service codes for each DCCP flow,
   given each uses a different DCCP port.  Although doing so might
   conflict with the media type of the m= line.  None of this is
   standardised yet and it wouldn't work as explained.  Hence
   multiplexing MUST NOT be performed even in this alternate scenario.

5.8.  RFC6773 - DCCP-UDP Encapsulation

   the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP), referred to as DCCP-

   current generation of Network Address Translation (NAT) middleboxes
   without modification of those middleboxes

5.10.  RFC6787 - Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2

   The Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2 (MRCPv2) allows client
   hosts to control media service resources such as speech synthesizers,
   recognizers, verifiers, and identifiers residing in servers on the
   network.  MRCPv2 is not a "stand-alone" protocol -- it relies on
   other protocols, such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), to
   coordinate MRCPv2 clients and servers and manage sessions between
   them, and the Session Description Protocol (SDP) to describe,
   discover, and exchange capabilities.  It also depends on SIP and SDP
   to establish the media sessions and associated parameters between the
   media source or sink and the media server.  Once this is done, the
   MRCPv2 exchange operates over the control session established above,
   allowing the client to control the media processing resources on the
   speech resource server.  RFC6787 [RFC6787] defines attributes for
   this purpose.

5.11.  RFC5245 - Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)

   RFC5245 [RFC5245] describes a protocol for Network Address
   Translator(NAT) traversal for UDP-based multimedia sessions
   established with the offer/answer model.  This protocol is called
   Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE).  ICE makes use of the
   Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) protocol and its
   extension,Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN).  ICE can be used by any
   protocol utilizing the offer/answer model, such as the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP).

   RFC6236 [RFC6236] proposes a new generic session setup attribute to
   make it possible to negotiate different image attributes such as
   image size.  A possible use case is to make it possible for a low-end
   hand- held terminal to display video without the need to rescale the
   image, something that may consume large amounts of memory and
   processing power.  The document also helps to maintain an optimal
   bitrate for video as only the image size that is desired by the
   receiver is transmitted.

5.16.  RFC6285 - Rapid Acquisition of Multicast RTP Sessions

   RFC6285 [RFC6285] describes a method using the existing RTP and RTP
   Control Protocol (RTCP) machinery that reduces the acquisition delay.
   In this method, an auxiliary unicast RTP session carrying the
   Reference Information to the receiver precedes or accompanies the
   multicast stream.  This unicast RTP flow can be transmitted at a
   faster than natural bitrate to further accelerate the acquisition.
   The motivating use case for this capability is multicast applications
   that carry real-time compressed audio and video.

5.22.  RFC6714 - MSRP-CEMA

   RFC6714 [RFC6714] defines a Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP)
   extension, Connection Establishment for Media Anchoring (CEMA).
   Support of this extension is OPTIONAL.  The extension allows
   middleboxes to anchor the MSRP connection, without the need for
   middleboxes to modify the MSRP messages; thus, it also enables secure
   end-to-end MSRP communication in networks where such middleboxes are
   deployed.  This document also defines a Session Description Protocol
   (SDP) attribute, 'msrp-cema', that MSRP endpoints use to indicate
   support of the CEMA extension.

5.33.  RFC6128 - RTCP Port for Multicast Sessions

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) has an attribute that allows
   RTP applications to specify an address and a port associated with the
   RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) traffic.  In RTP-based source-specific
   multicast (SSM) sessions, the same attribute is used to designate the
   address and the RTCP port of the Feedback Target in the SDP
   description.  However, the RTCP port associated with the SSM session
   itself cannot be specified by the same attribute to avoid ambiguity,
   and thus, is required to be derived from the "m=" line of the media
   description.  Deriving the RTCP port from the "m=" line imposes an
   unnecessary restriction.  RFC6128 [RFC6128] removes this restriction
   by introducing a new SDP attribute.

   RFC6189 [RFC6189] defines ZRTP, a protocol for media path Diffie-
   Hellman exchange to agree on a session key and parameters for
   establishing unicast Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
   sessions for Voice over IP (VoIP) applications.

5.39.  RFC3108 - ATM SDP

   RFC3108 [RFC3108] describes conventions for using the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) for characterizing ATM bearer connections
   using an AAL1, AAL2 or AAL5 adaptation layers.

   For AAL1, AAL2 and AAL5, bearer connections can be used to transport
   single media streams.  In addition, for AAL1 and AAL2, multiple media
   streams may be multiplexed into a bearer connection.  For all
   adaptation types (AAL1, AAL2 and AAL5), bearer connections may be
   bundled into a single media group.  In all cases addressed by
   RFC3108, a real-time media stream (voice, video, voiceband data,
   pseudo-wire and others) or a multiplex of media streams is mapped
   directly into an ATM connection.  RFC3108 does not address cases
   where ATM serves as a low-level transport pipe for IP packets which
   in turn may carry one or more real-time (e.g.  VoIP) media sessions
   with a life-cycle different from that of the underlying ATM
   transport.

6.3.  RFC3890 - Bandwidth Modifier for SDP

   RFC3890 [RFC3890] defines a Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   Transport Independent Application Specific Maximum (TIAS) bandwidth
   modifier that does not include transport overhead; instead an
   additional packet rate attribute is defined.  The transport
   independent bit-rate value together with the maximum packet rate can
   then be used to calculate the real bit-rate over the transport
   actually used.

   +--------------+-------------------------------+---------+----------+

                          RFC3890 bwtype Analysis

   The intention of TIAS is that the media level bit-rate is multiplied
   with the known per-packet overhead for the selected transport and the
   maxprate value to determine the worst case bit-rate from the
   transport to more accurately capture the required usage.  Summing
   TIAS values independently across m=lines and multiplying the computed
   sum with maxprate and the per-packet overhead would inflate the value
   significantly.Instead performing multiplication and adding the
   individual values is a more appropriate usage.This still ignores the
   fact that this is a send side declaration, and not intended for
   receiver negotiation.

   (ECN) can be used with the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) running
   over UDP, using the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) as a feedback
   mechanism.  It defines a new RTCP Extended Report (XR) block for
   periodic ECN feedback, a new RTCP transport feedback message for
   timely reporting of congestion events, and a Session Traversal

8.4.  RFC6642 - Third-Party Loss Report

   In a large RTP session using the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) feedback
   mechanism defined in RFC 4585 [RFC4585], a feedback target may
   experience transient overload if some event causes a large number of
   receivers to send feedback at once.  This overload is usually avoided
   by ensuring that feedback reports are forwarded to all receivers,
   allowing them to avoid sending duplicate feedback reports.  However,
   there are cases where it is not recommended to forward feedback
   reports, and this may allow feedback implosion.  RFC6642 [RFC6642]
   memo discusses these cases and defines a new RTCP Third-Party Loss
   Report that can be used to inform receivers that the feedback target
   is aware of some loss event, allowing them to suppress feedback.
   Associated Session Description Protocol (SDP) signaling is also
   defined.

   document are to be used with the SDP Grouping Framework (RFC 5888).
   These semantics allow the description of grouping relationships
   between the source and repair flows when one or more source and/or
   repair flows are associated in the same group, and they provide
   support for additive repair flows.  SSRC-level (Synchronization
   Source) grouping semantics are also defined in this document for
   Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) streams using SSRC multiplexing.

   RFC5109 [RFC5109] describes a payload format for generic Forward
   Error Correction (FEC) for media data encapsulated in RTP.  It is
   based on the exclusive-or (parity) operation.  The payload format
   allows end systems to apply protection using various protection
   lengths and levels, in addition to using various protection group
   sizes to adapt to different media and channel characteristics.  It
   enables complete recovery of the protected packets or partial
   recovery of the critical parts of the payload depending on the packet
   loss situation.
