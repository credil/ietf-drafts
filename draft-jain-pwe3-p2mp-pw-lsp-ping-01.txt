     Abstract 

        LSP-Ping is a widely deployed Operation, Administration, and 
        Maintenance (OAM) mechanism in MPLS networks. This document 
        describes a mechanism to verify connectivity of Point-to-Multipoint 
        (P2MP) Pseudowires (PW) using LSP Ping.

     1. Introduction 

        A Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Pseudowire (PW) emulates the essential 
        attributes of a unidirectional P2MP Telecommunications service such 
        as P2MP ATM over PSN. Requirements for P2MP PW are described in 
        [PPWREQ]. P2MP PWs are carried over P2MP MPLS LSP. The Procedure for 
        P2MP PW signaling using LDP for single segment P2MP PWs are 
        described in [PPWPWE3]. Many P2MP PWs can share the same P2MP MPLS 
        LSP and this arrangement is called Aggregate P-tree. The aggregate 
        P2MP trees require an upstream assigned label so that on the tail of 
        the P2MP LSP, the traffic can be associated with a VPN or a VPLS 
        instance. When a P2MP MPLS LSP carries only one VPN or VPLS service 
        instance, the arrangement is called Inclusive P-Tree. For Inclusive 
        P-Trees, P2MP MPLS LSP label itself can uniquely identify the VPN or 
        VPLS service being carried over P2MP MPLS LSP. The P2MP MPLS LSP can 
        also be used in Selective P-Tree arrangement for carrying multicast 
        traffic. In a Selective P-Tree arrangement, traffic to each 
        multicast group in a VPN or VPLS instance is carried by a separate

        unique P-tree. In Aggregate Selective P-tree arrangement, traffic to 
        a set of multicast groups from different VPN or VPLS instances is 
        carried over a same shared P-tree.  

        The P2MP MPLS LSP are setup either using MLDP [MLDP] or P2MP RSVP-TE 
        [RFC4875]. Mechanisms for fault detection and isolation for data 
        plane failures for P2MP MPLS LSPs are specified in [PLSPPING]. This 
        document describes a mechanism to detect data plane failures for 
        P2MP PW carried over P2MP MPLS LSPs.  

        This document defines a new FEC 130 Pseudowire sub-TLV for Target 
        FEC Stack for P2MP PW. The FEC 130 Pseudowire sub-TLV is added in 
        Target FEC Stack TLV by the originator of the echo request to inform 
        the receiver at P2MP MPLS LSP tail, of the P2MP PW being tested. 

        Multi-segment Pseudowires support is out of scope of this document 
        at present and may be included in future.

     4. Identifying a P2MP PW 

        This document introduces a new LSP Ping Target FEC Stack sub-TLV, 
        FEC 130 Pseudowire sub-TLV, to identify the P2MP PW under test at 
        the P2MP LSP Tail/Bud node.

     4.1. FEC 130 Pseudowire Sub-TLV 

        The FEC 130 Pseudowire sub-TLV fields are taken from P2MP PW FEC 
        Element (FEC Type 0x82) defined in [PPWPWE3]. The PW Type is a 15-
        bit number indicating the encapsulation type. It is carried right 
        justified in the field below PW Type with the high-order bit set to 
        zero. All the other fields are treated as opaque values and copied 
        directly from P2MP PW FEC Element (FEC Type 0x82) format.  

        The FEC 130 Pseudowire sub-TLV has the format shown in Figure 1. 
        This TLV will be included in the echo request sent over P2MP PW by 
        the originator of request.

        For Inclusive and Selective P2MP MPLS P-trees, the echo request will 
        be sent using the P2MP MPLS LSP label. 

        For Aggregate Inclusive and Aggregate Selective P-trees, the echo 
        request will be sent using a label stack of <P2MP MPLS P-tree label, 
        upstream assigned P2MP PW label>. The P2MP MPLS P-tree label is the 
        outer label and upstream assigned P2MP PW label is inner label. 

         

     5. Operations 

       In this section, we explain the operation of the LSP Ping over P2MP 
       PW. Figure 2 shows a P2MP PW PW1 setup from T-PE1 to remote PEs (T-

       can be MLDP P2MP MPLS LSP or P2MP TE tunnel.

                                  Figure 2: P2MP PW 
        

       When an operator wants to perform a connectivity check for the P2MP 
       PW1, the operator initiate a LSP-Ping request with the Target FEC 
       Stack TLV containing FEC 130 Pseudowire sub-TLV in the echo request 
       packet. The echo request packet is sent over the P2MP MPLS LSP using 
       the P2MP MPLS LSP label for Inclusive P-tree or with a label stack 
       with Upstream assigned P2MP PW label as bottom label and P2MP MPLS 
       LSP label as the top label. The intermediate P router will do swap 
       and replication based on the MPLS LSP label. Once the packet reaches 
       remote terminating PEs, the T-PEs will process the packet and perform 
       checks for the FEC 130 Pseudowire sub-TLV present in the Target FEC 
       Stack TLV as described in Section 4.4 in [RFC4379] and respond 
       according to [RFC4379] processing rules.

     6. Echo Reply using Downstream Assigned Label  

        Root of a P2MP PW may send an optional downstream assigned p2p MPLS 
        label in the LDP Label Mapping message for the P2MP PW signaling. If 
        the root of a P2MP PW expects leaf to send echo reply using the 
        downstream assigned label signaled in the Label Mapping message of 
        the P2MP PW message, the Reply Mode value of 4 "Reply via 
        application level control channel" should be used in Reply Mode 
        field described in Section 3 in [RFC4379] in echo request message 
        for the P2MP PW. 

     7. Controlling Echo Responses 

        The procedures described in [PLSPPING] for preventing congestion of 
        Echo Responses (Echo Jitter TLV) and limiting the echo reply to a 
        single egress node (Node Address P2MP Responder Identifier TLV) can 
        be applied to P2MP PW LSP Ping. 

     8. Security Considerations 

       The proposal introduced in this document does not introduce any new 
       security considerations beyond that already apply to [PLSPPING]. 
        
     9. IANA Considerations 

        This document defines a new sub-TLV type to be included in Target 
        FEC Stack TLV (TLV Type 1) [RFC4379] in LSP Ping.  

        IANA is requested to assign a sub-TLV type value to the following 
        sub-TLV from the "Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label 
        Switched Paths (LSPs) Parameters - TLVs" registry, "TLVs and sub-
        TLVs" sub-registry. 

         FEC 130 Pseudowire sub-TLV (See Section 3). Suggested value 24.
