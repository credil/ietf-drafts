Internet-Draft            DNRD-AP Query Format                  May 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document describes a specification for querying domain name
   registration data using a RESTful web service and uniform query
   patterns.  The service is implemented using the Hypertext Transfer
   Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2616] and conforms to the architectural
   constraints of Representational State Transfer (REST) [REST].

   The protocol described in this specification is intended to address
   deficiencies with the WHOIS protocol [RFC3912] that have been
   identified over time, including:

      Lack of standardized command structures,

      lack of standardized output and error structures,

      lack of support for internationalization and localization, and

      lack of support for user identification, authentication, and
      access control.

      REST: Representational State Transfer [REST]

      RWS: RESTful Web Service

      TLS: Transport Layer Security, specified in RFC 5246 [RFC5246]

      URI: Uniform Resource Identifier, specified in RFC 3986 [RFC3986]

      URL: Uniform Resource Locator, specified in RFC 3986 [RFC3986]

      XML: Extensible Markup Language, specified in W3C Recommendation
      REC-xml-20081126 [W3C.REC-xml-20081126]


3.  Design Considerations

   Representational State Transfer (REST) is a style of software
   architecture for distributed systems.  The style describes six
   constraints: client-server, stateless, cacheable, layered system,
   code on demand (optional), and uniform interface.  Systems that
   comply with these constraints are designed to have the properties of
   performance, scalability, simplicity, modifiability, visibility,
   portability, and reliability.  The principles of REST have been used
   to design other protocols such as the ATOM publishing protocol
   [RFC5023].

   A RESTful web service is a web service implemented using HTTP and the
   principles of REST.  It is a collection of resources, with three
   defined aspects:

   o  The "verbs" of the service are those strictly defined by the HTTP
      methods GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE,

   o  the "verbs" are used to act upon resources, and

   o  resources are addressable using URLs.

3.1.  Why RESTful?

   A RESTful approach to querying domain registration data offers
   several advantages when compared to the WHOIS protocol, including:

      Standardized output and error structures: outputs can be
      structured using encoding technologies like JSON and XML, which
      when paired with a well-defined specification will allow for
      automated processing.

Internet-Draft            DNRD-AP Query Format                  May 2012


      Support for internationalization: RWS structured data formats
      include complete support for both internationalized registration
      data and Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) with U-labels.

      Authentication and access control: HTTP, the transport for RWS,
      supports multiple native user identification and authentication
      schemes, and by using these capabilities RWS makes it possible to
      implement registration data access control mechanisms.

      Addressable service: RWS requires the use of a URI/URL standard
      structure for each object/resource.  This provides a way to
      unambiguously refer to objects.

      Increased usability: The inherent capabilities of the HTTP
      protocol (such as redirects) can be used to provide additional
      functionality, such as automatic referrals to more specific data
      sources without requiring specialized parsing by the client.

      Authenticity of origin: RWS provided over HTTP/TLS provides
      confidence in the origin of the information.

      Leverage existing infrastructure and expertise: RWS is HTTP-based
      and is supported using popular, commonly deployed web server
      infrastructures.


4.  Protocol Specification

   This section describes the DNRD-AP URL structure and methods used to
   create the uniform patterns needed to submit queries over HTTP.  Each
   query is sent to the server in the form of an HTTP "GET" or HTTP
   "HEAD" request.  A "GET" request will return both response headers
   and a response body.  A "HEAD" request will return only response
   headers.  A "HEAD" request can be used to verify URL syntax or
   resource availability without actually retrieving the requested
   resource.

   General specifications for using HTTP in a system to provide a
   RESTful DNRD query service are described in X (the design team HTTP
   draft).

   Client-supplied parameters MUST be interpreted in a case-insensitive,
   exact match manner in order to produce no more than one matching
   result.  Client parameters that can be used to match multiple
   registry or registrar data elements are described in (the domain
   search draft).

Internet-Draft            DNRD-AP Query Format                  May 2012


4.1.  Base URL Specification

   The uniform patterns start with a base URL [RFC3986] specified by the
   service provider offering this service.  Resource-type specific path
   segments are then appended to the end of the base URL.  The base URL
   may contain its own path segments (e.g. http://example.com/... or
   http://example.com/dnrd-ap/... ).

   The resource types that can be used to construct path segments
   include:

      'domain': Used to identify a domain name query.

      'nameserver': Used to identify a name server query.

      'contact': Used to identify a contact query.

      'registrar': Used to identify a registrar name query.

   The resource type MAY be omitted from the path segment.  If the
   resource type is omitted, the path segment MUST be interpreted as a
   domain path segment.

4.2.  Domain Path Segment Specification

   Syntax: domain/<domain name> or <domain name>

   The <domain name> parameter represents a domain name as specified in
   RFC 4343 [RFC4343].  Internationalized domain names represented in
   both A-label and U-label formats [RFC5890] are also valid domain
   names.  The following URLs are example queries for domain name
   registration information:

      http://example.com/dnrd-ap/domain/example.com/
      http://example.com/dnrd-ap/example.com/

   HTTP GET Request Format:

      GET /dnrd-ap/domain/example.com HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

   HTTP HEAD Request Format:

      HEAD /dnrd-ap/domain/example.com HTTP/1.1

Internet-Draft            DNRD-AP Query Format                  May 2012


      Host: example.com

4.3.  Name Server Path Segment Specification

   Syntax: nameserver/<name server name>

   The <name server name> parameter represents a host name as specified
   in RFC 952 [RFC0952] and RFC 1123 [RFC1123].  Internationalized host
   names represented in A-label format [RFC5890] are also valid host
   names.  The following URLs are example queries for name server
   registration information:

      http://example.com/dnrd-ap/nameserver/ns1.example.com/

   HTTP GET Request Format:

      GET /dnrd-ap/nameserver/ns1.example.com/ HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

   HTTP HEAD Request Format:

      HEAD /dnrd-ap/nameserver/ns1.example.com/ HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

4.4.  Contact Path Segment Specification

   Syntax: contact/<contact id>

   The <contact id> parameter represents a contact identifier as
   specified in RFC 5730 [RFC5730] and RFC 5733 [RFC5733].  The
   following URL is an example query for contact registration
   information:

   http://example.com/dnrd-ap/contact/CID-4005/

   HTTP GET Request Format:

      GET /dnrd-ap/contact/CID-4005/ HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

   HTTP HEAD Request Format:

      HEAD /dnrd-ap/contact/CID-4005/ HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

Internet-Draft            DNRD-AP Query Format                  May 2012


4.5.  Registrar Name Path Segment Specification

   Syntax: registrar/<registrar name>

   The <registrar name> parameter represents a Unicode text string as
   specified in RFC 5198 [RFC5198].  The following URL is an example
   query for registrar information:

   http://example.com/dnrd-ap/registrar/Example Registrar, Inc./

   HTTP GET Request Format:

      GET /dnrd-ap/registrar/Example Registrar, Inc./ HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

   HTTP HEAD Request Format:

      HEAD /dnrd-ap/registrar/Example Registrar, Inc./ HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

4.6.  Response Preference Specification

   DNRD-AP servers return responses encoded using one of multiple
   algorithms.  The client MAY signal the preferred format using an HTTP
   "Accept:" header.  The client can also signal the preferred format by
   adding a DOS-file-style extension to the resource.  For example,
   "/domain/example.com.xml/".  If the client specifies no preferred
   format the server MUST encode the response using a default format.
   If the client signals multiple formats with the HTTP "Accept:"
   header, or one format with the HTTP "Accept:" header and another with
   the extension style, the response will be encoded as described in
   Section X of (the draft DNRD-AP response document).

   The following media type values can be specified with the "Accept:"
   header:

      application/xml (for an XML-encoded response)

      application/json (for a JSON-encoded response)

      text/html (for an HTML-encoded response)

      text/plain (for a plain text response)

   HTTP GET Request Format for an XML-encoded Response:

Internet-Draft            DNRD-AP Query Format                  May 2012


      GET /dnrd-ap/domain/example.com HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Accept: application/xml

   HTTP HEAD Request Format for an XML-encoded Response:

      HEAD /dnrd-ap/domain/example.com HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Accept: application/xml

   Alternate HTTP GET Request Format for an XML-encoded Response:

      GET /dnrd-ap/domain/example.com.xml HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

   Alternate HTTP HEAD Request Format for an XML-encoded Response:

      HEAD /dnrd-ap/domain/example.com.xml HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

   HTTP GET Request Format for an XML- or JSON-encoded Response:

      GET /dnrd-ap/domain/example.com HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Accept: application/xml,application/json

   HTTP HEAD Request Format for an XML- or JSON-encoded Response:

      HEAD /dnrd-ap/domain/example.com HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Accept: application/xml,application/json


5.  Query Parameters

   To overcome issues with misbehaving HTTP cache infrastructure,
   clients may use the '__dnrd__cachebust' query parameter with a random
   value of their choosing.  Servers MUST ignore this query parameter.

   The following is an example use of this parameter to retrieve the
   domain registration data for the example.com domain:

   http://example.com/dnrd-ap/domain/example.com?__dnrd_cachebust=xyz123

   Clients SHOULD NOT send any other query parameters.

Internet-Draft            DNRD-AP Query Format                  May 2012


6.  Client Identification

   Access to resources can be restricted to clients that possess
   identification credentials negotiated using an out-of-band mechanism.
   For example, a service provider can provide clients with user names
   and passwords as part of a service agreement to gain access to
   restricted resources.  If available, clients MAY provide user name
   and password identification information to a server using the HTTP
   "basic" authentication scheme described in RFC 2617 [RFC2617].
   Considerations for making authorization and access control decisions
   based on client-provided identification information are described in
   Section X of (the draft DNRD-AP response document).

   Client user names and passwords MUST be protected using a facility
   that provides privacy and integrity services to protect against
   unintended disclosure and modification while in transit.  At a
   minimum, support for HTTP/TLS as described in RFC 2818 [RFC2818] MUST
   be provided.  Service providers can optionally specify and deploy
   additional security services.


7.  Internationalization Considerations

7.1.  Label Considerations

   There is value in supporting the ability to submit either a U-label
   (Unicode form of an IDN label) or an A-label (ASCII form of an IDN
   label) as a query argument to a DNRD service.  Users may most often
   prefer a U-label since this is more visually recognizable and
   familiar than A-label strings, but users of programmatic interfaces
   may wish to submit and display A-labels or may not be able to input
   U-labels with their keyboard configuration.

   Internationalized domain and host names can contain character
   variants and variant labels as described in RFC 4290 [RFC4290].
   Clients that support queries for internationalized domain and host
   names MUST accept service provider responses that describe variants
   as specified in (the draft DNRD-AP response document).

7.2.  Label Encoding

   Internationalized labels can be encoded in any of three different
   ways:

Internet-Draft            DNRD-AP Query Format                  May 2012


      U-label only: A U-label is entered as part of a path segment.  For
      example, /domain/"U+82F1""U+96C4".example.

      A-label only: A U-label is first converted to its corresponding
      A-label before being submitted to the server.  In the example
      above, the U-label would be converted to "xn--dj1az91b", and the
      path segment would be /domain/xn--dj1az91b.example.

      IRI -> URI conversion: An IRI (which contains the U-label) is
      converted to a URI using the algorithm described in RFC 3987
      [RFC3987] before being submitted to the server.  In the example
      above, the label would be converted to "%E8%8B%B1%E9%9B%84" and
      the path segment becomes /domain/%E8%8B%B1%E9%9B%84.example.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not specify any IANA actions.


9.  Security Considerations

   All of the security considerations described for HTTP in RFC 2616
   [RFC2616], HTTP Basic Authentication in RFC 2617 [RFC2617], HTTP Over
   TLS in RFC 2818 [RFC2818], and their successors are applicable.
   There are no additional considerations introduced by this
   specification.
