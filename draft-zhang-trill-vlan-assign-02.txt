           Adaptive VLAN Assignment for Data Center RBridges
                  draft-zhang-trill-vlan-assign-02.txt

Abstract

   If RBridges are casually assigned as Appointed Forwarders for VLANs
   without considering the number of MAC addresses and traffic load of
   these VLANs, it may overload some of the RBridges while leave other
   RBridges lightly loaded, which reduces the scalability of a RBridge
   network and undermines its performance. 

   A new protocol is designed in this document to support the adaptive
   VLAN assignment (or Appointed Forwarder selection) based on the
   forwarders' reporting of their usage of MAC tables and available
   bandwidth.

INTERNET-DRAFT              VLAN Assignment             October 31, 2011


1. Introduction

   The scales of Data Center Networks (DCNs) are expanding very fast
   these years. In DCNs, Ethernet switches and bridges are abundantly
   used for the interconnection of servers. The plug-and-play feature
   and the simple management and configuration of Ethernet are appealing
   to the DCN providers. A whole DCN can be a simple large layer 2
   Ethernet which is either built on a real network or on a virtual
   platform.

   Cloud Computing is growing up from DCNs which can be seen as a
   virtual platform that provides the reuse of the network resources of
   DCNs. A lot of cloud applications have been developed by DCN
   providers, such as Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Akamai's
   Application Delivery Network (ADN) and Microsoft's Azure. Cloud
   Computing clearly brings new challenges to the traditional Ethernet.
   The scales of the DCNs are becoming too large to be carried on the
   traditional Ethernet. The valuable MAC-tables of the bridges are
   running out of use for storing millions of MAC addresses. The
   broadcast of ARP messages consumes too much bandwidth and computing
   resources. The mobility of end stations brings dynamics to the
   network which can be a heavy burden if the management and
   configuration of the network involves too much manpower. The Spanning
   Tree Protocol used in the traditional Ethernet is becoming outdated
   since there is only a single viable path on the tree for a node pair
   and this path is not always the best path (e.g., shortest path). 

   RBridges are designed to improve the shortcomings of the traditional
   Ethernet. To make use of the rich connections, RBridges introduce
   multi-pathing to the Ethernet to break the single-path constraint of
   STP. Multiple points of attachment is a basic feature supported by
   RBridges and common for Data Center Bridges. This feature not only
   increases the "east-west" capacity but also greatly enhances the
   reliability of DCNs [VL2] [SAN]. If several RBridges are attached to
   a bridged LAN link at the same time, the DRB is responsible for the
   assignment of a VLAN to one of the RBridges as the Appointed
   forwarder. However, the current VLAN assignment is done in an one-way
   manner. The DRB casually assign a VLAN to an RBridge attached to the
   local link without knowing its available MAC-table entries or
   bandwidth. The appointed forwarder does not feedback the utilization
   of its MAC-table or bandwidth either.

   This document proposes to balance the load among VLANs and the load
   within a single VLAN. Two types of sub-TLVs are defined, with which a
   forwarder can report its MAC entries and traffic bit rate
   respectively. By gathering these report messages, the VLAN assignment
   can be done in a way that the usage of the MAC tables and bandwidth
   of the attached RBridges are balanced among the VLANs.

INTERNET-DRAFT              VLAN Assignment             October 31, 2011


1.1. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. Data Center RBridge

   Data Center Networks grow rapidly recently. Ethernet is widely used
   in data centers because of its simple management and plug-and-play
   features. However, there are shortcomings of Ethernet. RBridges are
   designed to improve these shortcomings. In this section, we analyze
   the characteristics of the DCNs that impact the design of RBridges
   and reveal why the adaptive VLAN assignment is important for RBridges
   to be used in DCNs.

2.1. Scalability

   In the past years, a large DCN is typically composed of tens of
   thousands servers interconnected through switches and bridges. In the
   cloud computing era, there can be as many as millions of servers in
   one DCN. The management of the numerous MAC addresses of the servers
   on the layer2 devices will become more and more complex. RBridges are
   aimed to replace the traditional bridges. Valuable CAM-tables on
   RBridges can easily be used up if they are not used reasonably
   [CAMtbl]. For RBridges to be widely used in DCNs, the VLANs should be
   assigned to the RBridges in a manner that the MAC entries of the
   VLANs on the RBridges are balanced.

2.2. East-West Capacity Increase

   The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) in the traditional LAN blocks some
   ports of the bridges for the purpose of loop avoidance. However, the
   side-effects of STP are obvious. The link bandwidth attached to the
   blocked ports are not used which greatly wastes the capacity of the
   network. On the tree topology, the communication between the bridges
   of the left branch and right branch must transit the single root
   bridge, which forms a "hair-pin turn".

   With the rapid increase of the amount of servers in DCNs and their
   traffic demand, it is urgent to break the constraint of STP and
   enhance the "east-west" capacity of DCNs which are always richly
   connected. RBridges use the multi-path routing to set up the data
   plane of a TRILL campus. Multiple RBridges may be attached to the
   same LAN link, which offers multiple access points to the LAN link.
   The hosts on this LAN link is therefore multi-homed to a TRILL
   campus. All the attached RBridges can act as the packet forwarder for
   the VLANs carried on this LAN link. In the worst case, all the VLANs

INTERNET-DRAFT              VLAN Assignment             October 31, 2011


   are assigned to the same RBridge. Under this scenario, the ingress
   capacity on the other RBridges is wasted. It is necessary to balance
   the traffic load of the VLANs among these RBridges through the
   assignment of the VLANs. 

2.3. Virtualization

   Virtualization is important for increasing the utilization of network
   resources in DCNs. For example, the VPNs can be used to separate the
   traffic from different services therefore they can be carried on the
   same pool of resources. When the VPNs is carried over a TRILL campus,
   RBridges can use a VLAN tag to identify each VPN. However, the use of
   VLANs multiplies the entries in the MAC table of the RBridges. Since
   a host can be a member of several VLANs at the same time, the
   RBridges have to store multiple copies of its MAC address in its
   precious MAC table. 

   Virtual Machines (VM) are widely used in DCNs. A physical host can
   support multiple VMs and each VM has to be identified by one MAC
   address that is need to be stored in the MAC tables of RBridges. This
   seriously increases the numbers of MAC entries in RBridges. Moreover,
   the number of VMs in a VLAN is not necessarily equal to the number of
   the physical hosts. VMs are spawned or destroyed based on the demand
   of the applications. They can also migrate from one location to
   another, which may be either an in-service or out-of-service move.
   VMs bring about the volatility of the size of VLANs. It is hard for a
   TRILL campus to provide one static VLAN assignment based on the
   numbers of physical hosts of VLANs that is proper for all
   applications all the time. It is necessarily to do VLAN assignment
   adaptively.

3. MAC Entries Usage 

   A CAM-table on a switch is expensive, which is a major constraint on
   the scalability of Ethernet [CAMtable]. When a RBridge is used to
   connect lots of hosts in large Data Center Networks, the entries of
   the CAM-table can easily be used up. The network should be tactically
   interconnected and the valuable MAC table entries should be used
   economically.

   RBridges support multiple points of attachment [RFC6325]. When
   RBridges are used in a DCN to form a TRILL campus, a LAN link MAY
   have multiple access points to this network. All the access RBridges
   are able to act as the packet forwarder of the VLANs carried on this
   LAN link. The DRB of this LAN link is responsible to pick out one
   RBridge attached to this LAN link as the appointed forwarder for each
   VLAN-x. In other words, the DRB assigns VLAN-x to one of the RBridge.
   For an assigned VLAN, its forwarder is not only responsible for

   forwarding the packets but also need to store the active MAC
   addresses of the hosts on this VLAN. 

   If the VLANs on the LAN link are not appointed properly, some of the
   RBridges's MAC tables are easily to be used up while the other
   RBridges are left idle. Take Figure 3.1 as an example, there are four
   VLANs carried on the LAN link: w, x, y and z. There are two hosts in
   both VLAN-w and VLAN-x and one host in both VLAN-y and VLAN-z. RB1
   and RB2 are both attached to this LAN link. RB1 is elected as the
   Designated RBridge who is responsible to choose the appointed
   forwarder for the above VLANs. In the figure, VLAN-w,x are assigned
   to RB1 and VLAN-y,z are assigned to RB2. Obviously, this assignment
   is not balanced, since the MAC table of RB1 has four entries while
   the MAC table of RB2 only has two entries. If the DRB can reassign
   VLAN-w to RB2 and reassign VLAN-y to RB1, both RBridges will have
   three MAC entries, therefore a more balanced assignment is achieved.

             Figure 3.1: Unbalanced assignment among VLANs

   In order to assign the VLANs in a balanced way, the DRB need to know
   the usage of the MAC tables of its appointed forwarders and the sum
   of the MAC addresses in each VLAN. Since RBridges only store the

   active MAC addresses and a virtual machine can move from one location
   to another, the MAC entries a VLAN occupies on an RBridge varies from
   time to time. The assignment of the VLANs cannot be done once for
   all. It is necessary for the DRB to do the assignment adaptively
   taking the usage of MAC tables of its appointed forwarders into
   consideration. In Section 5.1, the MAC Entries Report sub-TLV is
   defined to deliver this kind of information from a forwarder to a
   DRB.

4. Load Distribution

   The traffic from the TRILL campus to the local LAN link is the
   egressing traffic while the traffic from the local LAN link to the
   TRILL campus is the ingressing traffic. A forwarder RBridge acts as
   both the ingress and egress point of a VLAN's traffic. The assignment
   of the appointed forwarder for each VLAN affects both the egress and
   ingress traffic load distribution.

4.1. Egress Traffic

   One RBridge MAY have multiple ports attached to the same local LAN
   link. These ports are called "port group" [RFC6325]. When a DRB
   assigns a VLAN to an RBridge, its total available egress bandwidth of
   the port group needs to be taken into consideration. 

   After VLAN-x has been assigned to an RBridge, the forwarding port
   assignment of one of the port group to VLAN-x as the forwarding port
   is entirely a local matter. Since a LAN link is a STP domain, more
   than one forwarding port for one VLAN will cause a loop. The
   forwarder MUST assign one and only one port for each VLAN. Load
   balancing can be realized through splitting the load among different
   VLANs as suggested in Section 4.4.4 of [RFC6325]. 

4.2. Ingress Traffic

   After the known unicast packets enter the TRILL campus from the
   ingress RBridge, they can be sent through the paths starting at this
   ingress point. Since the DRB knows the whole topology of the TRILL
   campus, it can figure out these paths as well. Therefore, the DRB
   should take the available bandwidth of these paths into consideration
   when assigning the appointed forwarder of a VLAN. Any assignment that
   is possible to congest an already busy ingress point or a path should
   be avoided. 

   Traffic Matrices are usually taken as the input to the traffic
   engineering methods [TE]. VLAN assignment actually changes the
   Traffic Matrix of a TRILL campus. Therefore, our adaptive VLAN
   assignment can work together with traffic engineering methods to

   achieve a balanced traffic distribution of the whole network.
   However, the design of this kind of cooperative mechanism is out the
   scope of this document.

   With the TLV defined in Section 5.2, the egressing and ingressing
   traffic of an appointed forwarder are reported to its DRB. 

5. TLV Definition

   The Appointed Forwarders TLV has already been defined in [RFC6326].
   With this TLV, the DRB can appoint an RBridge on the local link to be
   the forwarder for each VLAN. However, there is no feedback from the
   appointed forwarder to notify the DRB whether the assignment is
   reasonable. Two sub-TLVs are defined in this section to open the
   passageway of feedback. 

5.1. MAC Entries Report sub-TLV 

   The appointed forwarder use MAC Entries Report sub-TLV to report the
   usage of its MAC table to the DRB. It has the following format:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Type=MACEtrRep |                               (1 byte)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   |  Maximum MAC Entries          |               (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Available MAC Entries        |               (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |          MAC Entries of VLAN (1)            | (4 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |          ......                             | (4 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |          MAC Entries of VLAN (n)            | (4 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   where each MAC Entries of VLAN is of the form:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | RESV  |   VLAN ID             |               (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | The Number of MAC Entries     |               (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   o  Type: MAC Entries Report sub-TLV.

      appointed forwarder selects to report their numbers of MAC entries
      in its MAC table. 

   o  DRB Nickname: The nickname of the Designated RBridge of the local

      given VLAN occupies in the MAC table of the appointed forwarder.
      These MAC entries does not only contain the local MACs of the

   The appointed forwarder use Traffic Bit Rate Report sub-TLV to report
   the bandwidth utilization of its port group to the DRB. This sub-TLV
   has the following format:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Type=TrafficRep|                               (1 byte)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Length       |                               (1 byte)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  DRB Nickname                 |               (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Maximum Link Bandwidth       |               (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Available Link Bandwidth     |               (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Traffic Bit Rate of VLAN (1)               | (4 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |              ......                         | (4 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Traffic Bit Rate of VLAN (n)               | (4 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   where each Load of VLAN is of the form: 

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | RESV|D|   VLAN ID             |               (2 bytes)

   |  Traffic Bit Rate             |               (2 bytes)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   o  Type: Traffic Bit Rate Report sub-TLV.

   o  Length:  6+4n bytes, where n is the number of VLANs that the
      appointed forwarder selects to report their traffic load that
      egress onto the port group. 

   o  DRB Nickname: The nickname of the Designated RBridge of the local
      link.

   o  Maximum Link Bandwidth: The maximum bandwidth of the port group
      attached to the local link.

   o  Available Link Bandwidth: The available bandwidth of the port
      group attached to the local link.

   o  RESV: 3 bits that MUST be sent as zero and ignored on receipt.

   o  D: The direction of the traffic. Value "0" denotes the egressing
      traffic volume and value "1" denotes the ingressing traffic
      volume.

   o  VLAN ID: This field identifies one of the VLANs that assigned to
      the appointed forwarder.

   o  Traffic Bit Rate: The traffic bit rate of the given VLAN onto the
      local link through the port group of the appointed forwarder.

6. Adaptive VLAN Assignment

   All appointed forwarders advertise the MAC Entries Report TLV and
   Traffic Bit Rate Report TLV in LSPs to their DRBs. The number of
   VLANs in these TLVs is constrained by the inter-RBridge link MTU
   whose default value is 1470 octets. If the MTU is not big enough to
   hold the statistics of all VLANs, appointed forwarders choose VLANs
   in the order of most MAC entries first and highest load first to
   report to the DRB. An appointed forwarder SHOULD report these two
   TLVs to its DRB when its adjacency to the DRB enters Report state
   [RFC6327] and each time the DRB assigns a VLAN to it. The usage of
   the MAC table and the utilization of bandwidth of this appointed
   forwarder is calculated on the DRB. The DRB can choose an appointed

   forwarder for the local link based on Least Usage/Utilization First
   (LUF) policy. If an RBridge on the local link is already heavily
   loaded, the DRB should refrain from assigning additional VLANs to it.

   It has been a common practice to collect MAC table usage in bridge
   networks. Through the collection of TLVs (These TLVs can be stored in
   MIB [RBmib].) defined in this document, operators will have a vision
   of the MAC table usage and bandwidth utilization of the RBridges on
   the LAN link. Based on this vision, operators can easily recognize
   the hot spot of the TRILL campus. 

   Because of host mobility, a former balanced VLAN assignment MAY
   become unbalanced. If a forwarder's MAC table or bandwidth is running
   out of use, operators can remove some VLANs from it and reassign them
   to another RBridge on the local link as the new forwarder.

7. Security Considerations

   The delivery of the messages types in this document can be protected
   with the cryptographic mechanism proposed in [RFC5310]. 

8. IANA Considerations

   This document suggests to specify two new sub-TLVs from existing sub-
   TLV sequences -- namely MACEtrRep and TrafficRep. 

                    Section  sub-   MT Port  Router   Extended   NUM
                             TLV#   Capabil. Capabil. IS Reach
   MACEtrRep        5.1       4        X        -        -        *
   TrafficRep       5.2       5        X        -        -        *
