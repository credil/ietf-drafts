1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivations

   In the PAWS protocol, the master device queries the database for
   available spectrum, but the device MUST determine the URL for the
   database before it can send any PAWS messages.  Brief discussions of
   database discovery can be found in [PAWS RQMTS] and [PAWS PROTOCOL].

   Several different choices can be taken for the device to determine
   the appropriate URL(s) for connection.  There are some possible
   methods for this purpose (not all methods are included here): (1) the
   manufacturer or the user of device can manually pre-configure
   statically the URL(s) of one or more databases that is available for
   the device to query white space spectrum (e.g. the device and
   database have agreements with each other.), for example, if the
   device is to be used in US, it will be configured with the database
   of US, and then it directly connects to the database in US, or if the
   device is to be used in several countries it can be configured with
   different database for each country ; (2) or the device can be
   configured by certain provisioning process after attaching to
   operator's network.

   But in some scenarios the methods above may not work well.  For
   example, to pre-configure a device, the user has to know the
   available database(s) that can be used in the regulatory domain, and
   it may be inconvenient to do so especially when the device is moved
   to a different regulatory domain.  So a dynamic database discovery
   mechanism is provided here, and the mechanism can be used
   independently or cooperate with other methods, e.g. device can first
   connect to the configured or provisioned databases, if that fails
   then the device can use the dynamic mechanism to find out available
   databases.

   Besides, it is possible that some databases are not available any
   more or some new databases are setup, the pre-configuring and
   provisioning method may not cope with it very well.

   The mechanism discussed in this memo will be provided as an OPTIONAL
   method as described in PAWS PROTOCOL [PAWS PROTOCOL].

1.2.  Mechanism overview

   The dynamic database discovery mechanism provided here is used by a
   device to discover the available white space databases for its
   current location and related regulatory domain information.

   In the discovery procedure, the URL for the database SHOULD be

   obtained from an authorized and authenticated entity.  The master
   device provides its current geo-location information to the entity in
   a Database Discovery Request message, and the entity will return a
   list of available databases and the regulatory body that has
   jurisdiction over the master device's location.

   When the master device gets the information about available database
   and regulatory body, it can choose the proper database for querying
   white space spectrum by PAWS procedures.

   The database discovery mechanism is based on LoST protocol [RFC5222].

1.3.  Brief introduction of LoST

   LoST (Location-to-Service Translation Protocol) is an XML-based
   protocol for mapping service identifiers and geodetic or civic
   location information to service contact URLs.

           Figure 1: An overview of procedures in LoST protocol

   The LoST client sends its location information and service type it
   wants to LoST server to retrieve one or more service URLs.

   The LoST server maintains the mapping relationship between location
   and service URL, and on receiving request message it maps the
   location and service identifier in the request to one or more service
   URLs that can offer the service in the location.

   LoST can operate in either recursive or iterative mode, on a request-
   by-request basis.  In recursive mode, the LoST server initiates
   queries on behalf of the requester and returns the result to the
   requester.

   In iterative mode, the server contacted returns a redirection
   response indicating the next server to be queried if the server
   contacted cannot provide an answer itself.


2.  Terminology and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

   The terminology from PAWS: problem statement, use cases and
   requirements PAWS RQMTS [PAWS RQMTS] is applicable to this document.

   White Space Database (WSDB)

   In the context of white space and cognitive radio technologies, the
   database is an entity which contains, but is not limited to, current
   information as required by the regulatory policies about available
   spectrum at any given location and time, and other types of related
   (to the white space spectrum) or relevant information.

   White Space Database Discovery Server (WSDB DS)

   A server function provided to a white space device, the client.  The
   white space device contacts a white space database discovery server
   to receive the service of discovering or identifying one or more
   white space databases.  The white space database discovery server is
   a known entity to the white space device, which knows at least a
   useable internet address for the white space database discovery
   server.  The white space database discovery server takes as input
   positioning information from the white space device and returns both
   URLs of white space databases that cover white space device's current
   location and indication of the regulatory domain governing at the
   white space device's current location.  A single white space database
   discovery server may have global scope, serving clients located
   globally.

   Service boundary

   A service boundary circumscribes the region within which all
   locations map to the same service URL or set of URLs for a given
   service.  A service boundary may consist of several non-contiguous

   geometric shapes.

   Mapping

   Mapping is a process that takes a location and a service identifier
   as inputs and returns one or more URLs.  Those URLs can point either
   to a host providing that service or to a host that in turn routes the
   request to the final destination.

   Device

   The device in this memo is equivalent to the master device described
   in PAWS RQMTS [PAWS RQMTS].


3.  System Architecture Description

   Before the WSD can query a trusted WSDB for a list of available
   frequencies or channels for use in the white space spectrum, the WSD
   must first discover the available databases and addresses serving the
   regulatory domain in which the device is currently located.  At
   power-up the WSD does not reliably know the regulatory domain
   corresponding to its current location, and therefore does not
   reliably know with which white space database(s) it can communicate.
   Furthermore it is essential that the WSD connect with a trusted WSDB
   for proper operation and indeed regulatory compliance.

   The discovery system is based on client-server model; the basic model
   is shown in Figure 2, where WSDB DB (WSDB Discovery Server) plays the
   role of LoST server and Master device acts as LoST client.

                  +----------+                +----------+
                  | Master   |   <-------->   | WSDB DS  |
                  +----------+                +----------+

                    Figure 2: DB discovery system model

   The WSDB DS takes as input location information from the WSD and
   returns to the WSD one or more addresses of WSDBs (or WSDB listing
   servers as appropriate) to the WSD.

   For the discovery mechanism to work well, some assumptions have to be
   considered:

   (1) Master device can get its geo-location directly or indirectly.

   (2) Master device has gotten the URL (or IP address) of a trusted
   WSDB DS before starting the discovery procedure.

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                 April 2013


   The URL or IP address of WSDB DS can be found by any method such as
   DNS, DHCP, manually configuring etc, and it is out of scope of this
   document.

   When the WSD does not have the address of a serviceable WSDB (e.g. at
   power-up), the WSD sends a Discovery Request message to a WSDB DS.
   The WSD includes in the Discovery Request information about its
   current location.  The WSDB DS uses this location information to
   determine the regulatory domain where the WSD is located, and returns
   a Discovery Response message which includes the address of one or
   more WSDBs (or WSDB listing server as appropriate) to the WSD.

   An overview of procedures of how master device gets available
   spectrum from WSDB is depicted in Figure 3.

   is not authorized at the WSD physical location, the response will
   contain an error code and no address information.

        Figure 4: High level view of white space database discovery

   In the response message a list of databases that cover the location
   are included, when a database is included, it only means the location
   is in its coverage range but not means the master device can get
   service from the database, because the database may need the master
   device has service agreement or some other relationship with it.  So
   master device needs to select an available database from the database
   list.

   After master device has selected a available database for service, it
   can then use the PAWS protocol PAWS PROTOCOL [PAWS PROTOCOL] to
   retrieve the available spectrum for its location.

4.  Specification

   LoST (Location to Service Translation Protocol) is a protocol for
   mapping a service identifier (URN) and location information to one or
   more service URLs and associated information.  LoST mapping queries
   can contain either civic or geodetic location information.  LoST
   queries can be resolved recursively or iteratively.

   LoST messages are carried in HTTP and HTTPS protocol exchanges,
   facilitating use of TLS for protecting the integrity and
   confidentiality of requests and responses.

   This discovery mechanism utilizes LoST to communicate between master
   device and WSDB DS, the master device acts as LoST client and WSDB DS
   plays the role of LoST server.  The protocol stack is shown in Figure
   5.  To use LoST for this discovery mechanism, several issues have to
   be clarified.

4.1.  Issues to be clarified

4.1.1.  Service Identifier

   A new service identifier for PAWS database discovery needs to be
   defined, according to RFC5031 [RFC5031], a top-level service and a
   sub-service are defined here.

         +----------------+-------------------------------------+
         |     Service    |             Description             |
         +----------------+-------------------------------------+
         |      paws      |      top-level service of PAWS      |
         | paws.discovery | the PAWS database discovery service |
         +----------------+-------------------------------------+

                                  Table 1

   So according to the service-identifying labels defined above, the
   service URN for PAWS database discovery service is as follow:

   urn:service:paws.discovery

4.1.2.  Conveying of regulatory domain

   The name of regulatory domain can be conveyed using <displayName>
   element in the LoST response message.

   [Note: the format and content of the regulatory domain information
   are TBD.]

4.1.3.  Database administrator information

   The WSDB DS can return one or more databases to master device, but
   because the databases are in the form of URL so it may be difficult
   to decide which one has service agreement with the master device.
   Here an extension to LoST is needed: for every <URL> element that
   used for conveying URL a new attribute (admin) which contains the
   database's administrator information needs to be added.

   Based on the newly added attribute master device can choose the
   database that it has agreement with.

4.2.  Discovery procedures

4.2.1.  Discovery Request procedure

   The discovery request procedure uses the <findService> query message
   of LoST for conveying parameters.  Master device's location
   information will be included in the <location> element.

   The service identifier defined in Section 4.1.1 is specified in the
   <service> element.

   The following is an example of discovery request procedure message,
   using geodetic coordinates.

          </p2:Point>
        </location>
        <service>urn:service:paws.discovery</service>
      </findService>


4.2.2.  Discovery Response procedure

   The discovery response procedure uses the <findServiceResponse>
   response message of LoST for conveying parameters.

   After receiving the <findService> query message, the WSDB DS will map
   the location information and service identifier to one or more
   available WSDBs' URL.

   Then in the <findServiceResponse> message, a list of WSDBs' URL and
   regulatory domain that has jurisdiction over the current location
   will be conveyed to master device.  The regulatory domain is
   contained in <displayName> element.

   The service boundary of the WSDB can also be included in the response
   message to indicate the region for which the service URL returned
   would be the same as in the actual query.  Or a service boundary
   reference can be returned to master device, and master device
   retrieve service boundary by this reference as needed.  Next time
   when the master device powers up, if its location is within the
   service boundary it then may use the WSDB retrieved before.

   An example of discovery response procedure message is shown as
   follow:

4.2.3.  Recursion and Iteration

   If the WSDB DS can not provide available WSDB for master device, then
   it may wish other WSDB DS to serve the master device's query request.
   In LoST, recursion and iteration patterns are provided for this
   purpose.

   In recursive mode, the LoST server initiates queries on behalf of the
   requester and returns the result to the requester.

   In iterative mode, the server contacted returns a redirection
   response indicating the next server to be queried if the server
