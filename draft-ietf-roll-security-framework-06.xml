      <t>This document presents a security framework for routing over low
      power and lossy networks (LLN). The development builds upon previous
      work on routing security and adapts the assessments to the issues and
      constraints specific to low power and lossy networks. A systematic
      approach is used in defining and evaluating the security threats and
      identifying applicable countermeasures. These assessments provide the
      basis of the security recommendations for incorporation into low power,
      lossy network routing protocols. As an illustration, this framework is
      applied to IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks
      (RPL).</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>In recent times, networked electronic devices have found an
      increasing number of applications in various fields. Yet, for reasons
      ranging from operational application to economics, these wired and
      wireless devices are often supplied with minimum physical resources; the
      constraints include those on computational resources (RAM, clock speed,
      storage), communication resources (duty cycle, packet size, etc.), but
      also form factors that may rule out user access interface (e.g., the
      housing of a small stick-on switch), or simply safety considerations
      (e.g., with gas meters). As a consequence, the resulting networks are
      more prone to loss of traffic and other vulnerabilities. The
      proliferation of these low power and lossy networks (LLNs), however, are
      drawing efforts to examine and address their potential networking
      challenges. Securing the establishment and maintenance of network
      connectivity among these deployed devices becomes one of these key
      challenges.</t>

      <t>This document presents a framework for securing Routing Over LLNs
      (ROLL) through an analysis that starts from the routing basics. The
      objective is two-fold. First, the framework will be used to identify
      pertinent security issues. Second, it will facilitate both the
      assessment of a protocol's security threats and the identification of
      the necessary features for development of secure protocols for the ROLL
      Working Group.</t>

      <t>The approach adopted in this effort proceeds in four steps, to
      examine security issues in ROLL, to analyze threats and attacks, to
      consider the countermeasures, and then to make recommendations for
      securing ROLL. The basis is found on identifying the assets and points
      of access of routing and evaluating their security needs based on the
      Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) model in the context
      of LLN. The utility of this framework is demonstrated with an
      application to IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks
      (RPL) <xref target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>This document adopts and conforms to the terminology defined in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-roll-terminology"></xref> and in <xref
      target="RFC4949"></xref>, with the following addition:</t>

      <t><list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Node">An element of a low power lossy network that may
          be a router or a host.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="cons-on-roll-sec" title="Considerations on ROLL Security">
      <t>Security, in essence, entails implementing measures to ensure
      controlled state changes on devices and network elements, both based on
      external inputs (received via communications) or internal inputs
      (physical security of device itself and parameters maintained by the
      device, including, e.g., clock). State changes would thereby involve
      proper authorization for actions, authentication, and potentially
      confidentiality, but also proper order of state changes through
      timeliness (since seriously delayed state changes, such as commands or
      updates of routing tables, may negatively impact system operation). A
      security assessment can therefore begin with a focus on the assets or
      elements of information that may be the target of the state changes and
      the access points in terms of interfaces and protocol exchanges through
      which such changes may occur. In the case of routing security the focus
      is directed towards the elements associated with the establishment and
      maintenance of network connectivity.</t>

      <t>This section sets the stage for the development of the framework by
      applying the systematic approach proposed in <xref
      target="Myagmar2005"></xref> to the routing security problem, while also
      drawing references from other reviews and assessments found in the
      literature, particularly, <xref target="RFC4593"></xref> and <xref
      target="Karlof2003"></xref>; thus, the work presented herein may find
      use beyond routing for LLNs. The subsequent subsections begin with a
      focus on the elements of a generic routing process that is used to
      establish routing assets and points of access to the routing
      functionality. Next, the CIA security model is briefly described. Then,
      consideration is given to issues specific to or amplified in LLNs. This
      section concludes with the formulation of a set of security objectives
      for ROLL.</t>

      <section anchor="routing-assets"
               title="Routing Assets and Points of Access">
        <t>An asset implies an important system component (including
        information, process, or physical resource), the access to, corruption
        or loss of which adversely affects the system. In network routing,
        assets lie in the routing information, routing process, and node's
        physical resources. That is, the access to, corruption, or loss of
        these elements adversely affects system routing. In network routing, a
        point of access refers to the point of entry facilitating
        communication with or other interaction with a system component in
        order to use system resources to either manipulate information or gain
        knowledge of the information contained within the system. Security of
        the routing protocol must be focused on the assets of the routing
        nodes and the points of access of the information exchanges and
        information storage that may permit routing compromise. The
        identification of routing assets and points of access hence provides a
        basis for the identification of associated threats and attacks.</t>

        <t>This subsection identifies assets and points of access of a generic
        routing process with a level-0 data flow diagram <xref
        target="Yourdon1979"></xref> revealing how the routing protocol
        interacts with its environment. In particular, the use of the data
        flow diagram allows for a clear, concise model of the routing
        functionality; it also has the benefit of showing the manner in which
        nodes participate in the routing process, thus providing context when
        later threats and attacks are considered. The goal of the model is to
        be as detailed as possible so that corresponding components and
        mechanisms in an individual routing protocol can be readily
        identified, but also to be as general as possible to maximize the
        relevancy of this effort for the various existing and future
        protocols. Nevertheless, there may be discrepancies, likely in the
        form of additional elements, when the model is applied to some
        protocols. For such cases, the analysis approach laid out in this
        document should still provide a valid and illustrative path for their
        security assessment.</t>

        <t><xref target="Fig1"></xref> shows that nodes participating in the
        routing process transmit messages to discover neighbors and to
        exchange routing information; routes are then generated and stored,
        which may be maintained in the form of the protocol forwarding table.
        The nodes use the derived routes for making forwarding decisions.</t>

        the security framework is to be comprehensive. Hence, some of the
        discussion which follows is associated with assets and points of
        access that are not directly related to routing protocol design but

        consequences on the security of routing.</t>

        <t>At the conceptual level, security within an information system in
        general and applied to ROLL in particular is concerned with the
        primary issues of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In the
        context of ROLL:</t>

        <t><list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Confidentiality"><vspace />Confidentiality involves
            the protection of routing information as well as routing neighbor
            maintenance exchanges so that only authorized and intended network
            entities may view or access it. Because LLNs are most commonly
            found on a publicly accessible shared medium, e.g., air or wiring
            in a building, and sometimes formed ad hoc, confidentiality also
            extends to the neighbor state and database information within the
            routing device since the deployment of the network creates the
            potential for unauthorized access to the physical devices
            themselves.</t>

            <t hangText="Integrity"><vspace />Integrity, as a security
            principle, entails the protection of routing information and
            routing neighbor maintenance exchanges, as well as derived
            information maintained in the database, from unauthorized
            modification or from misuse. Misuse, for example, may take the
            form of a delayed or inappropriately replayed message even where
            confidentiality protection is maintained. Hence, in addition to
            the data itself, integrity also concerns the authenticity of
            claimed identity of the origin and destination of a message and
            its timeliness or freshness. On the other hand, the access to
            and/or removal of data, execution of the routing process, and use
            of a device's computing and energy resources, while relevant to
            routing security are considered larger system integrity issues
            <xref target="RFC4949"></xref> to be addressed beyond the routing
            protocol.</t>

            <t hangText="Availability"><vspace />Availability ensures that
            routing information exchanges and forwarding services need to be
            available when they are required for the functioning of the
            serving network. Availability will apply to maintaining efficient
            and correct operation of routing and neighbor discovery exchanges
            (including needed information) and forwarding services so as not
            to impair or limit the network's central traffic flow
            function.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>It is recognized that, besides those security issues captured in
        the CIA model, non-repudiation, that is, the assurance that the
        transmission and/or reception of a message cannot later be denied, may
        be a security requirement under certain circumstances. The service of
        non-repudiation applies after-the-fact and thus relies on the logging
        or other capture of on-going message exchanges and signatures. Applied
        to routing, non-repudiation will involve providing some ability to
        allow traceability or network management review of participants of the
        routing process including the ability to determine the events and
        actions leading to a particular routing state. As such,
        non-repudiation of routing may thus be more useful when interworking
        with networks of different ownerships. For the LLN application domains
        as described in <xref target="RFC5548"></xref>, <xref
        target="RFC5673"></xref>, <xref target="RFC5826"></xref>, and <xref
        target="RFC5867"></xref>, particularly with regard to routing
        security, proactive measures are much more critical than retrospective
        protections. Furthermore, given the significant practical limits to
        on-going routing transaction logging and storage and individual device
        signature authentication for each exchange, non-repudiation in the
        context of routing is not further considered as a ROLL security
        issue.</t>

        <t>It should be emphasized here that for routing security the above
        CIA requirements must be complemented by the proper security policies
        and enforcement mechanisms to ensure that security objectives are met
        by a given routing protocol implementation.</t>

               title="Issues Specific to or Amplified in LLNs">
        <t>The work <xref target="RFC5548"></xref>, <xref
        target="RFC5673"></xref>, <xref target="RFC5826"></xref>, and <xref
        target="RFC5867"></xref> have identified specific issues and
        constraints of routing in LLNs for the urban, industrial, home
        automation, and building automation application domains, respectively.
        The following is a list of observations and evaluation of their impact
        on routing security considerations.</t>

        <t><list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
            <t
            hangText="Limited energy, memory, and processing node resources"><vspace />As
            a consequence of these constraints, there is an even more critical
            need than usual for a careful study of trade-offs on which and
            what level of security services are to be afforded during the
            system design process. In addition, the choices of security
            mechanisms are more stringent. Synchronization of security states
            with sleepy nodes is yet another issue.</t>

            <t hangText="Large scale of rolled out network"><vspace />The
            possibly numerous nodes to be deployed, e.g., an urban deployment
            can see several hundreds of thousands of nodes, as well as the
            generally low level of expertise expected of the installers, make
            manual on-site configuration unlikely. Prolonged rollout and
            delayed addition of nodes, which may be from old inventory, over
            the lifetime of the network, also complicate the operations of key
            management.</t>

            <t hangText="Autonomous operations"><vspace />Self-forming and
            self-organizing are commonly prescribed requirements of LLNs. In
            other words, a routing protocol designed for LLNs needs to contain
            elements of ad hoc networking and in most cases cannot rely on
            manual configuration for initialization or local filtering rules.
            Network topology/ownership changes, partitioning or merging, as
            well as node replacement, can all contribute to complicating the
            operations of key management.</t>

            <t hangText="Highly directional traffic"><vspace />Some types of
            LLNs see a high percentage of their total traffic traverse between
            the nodes and the LLN Border Routers (LBRs) where the LLNs connect
            to non-LLNs. The special routing status of and the greater volume
            of traffic near the LBRs have routing security consequences. In
            fact, when Point-to-MultiPoint (P2MP) and MultiPoint-to-Point
            (MP2P) traffic represents a majority of the traffic, routing
            attacks consisting of advertising untruthfully preferred routes
            may cause serious damages.</t>

            <t
            hangText="Unattended locations and limited physical security"><vspace />Many
            applications have the nodes deployed in unattended or remote
            locations; furthermore, the nodes themselves are often built with
            minimal physical protection. These constraints lower the barrier
            of accessing the data or security material stored on the nodes
            through physical means.</t>

            <t hangText="Support for mobility"><vspace />On the one hand, only
            a number of applications require the support of mobile nodes,
            e.g., a home LLN that includes nodes on wearable health care
            devices or an industry LLN that includes nodes on cranes and
            vehicles. On the other hand, if a routing protocol is indeed used
            in such applications, it will clearly need to have corresponding
            security mechanisms.</t>

            <t hangText="Support for multicast and anycast"><vspace />Support
            for multicast and anycast is called out chiefly for large-scale
            networks. Since application of these routing mechanisms in
            autonomous operations of many nodes is new, the consequence on
            security requires careful consideration.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The above list considers how a LLN's physical constraints, size,
        operations, and varieties of application areas may impact security.
        However, it is the combinations of these factors that particularly
        stress the security concerns. For instance, securing routing for a
        large number of autonomous devices that are left in unattended
        locations with limited physical security presents challenges that are
        not found in the common circumstance of administered networked
        routers. The following subsection sets up the security objectives for
        the routing protocol designed by the ROLL WG.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="roll-objs" title="ROLL Security Objectives">
        <t>This subsection applies the CIA model to the routing assets and
        access points, taking into account the LLN issues, to develop a set of
        ROLL security objectives.</t>

        <t>Since the fundamental function of a routing protocol is to build
        routes for forwarding packets, it is essential to ensure that<list
            style="symbols">
            <t>routing/topology information is not tampered during transfer
            and in storage;</t>

            <t>routing/topology information is not misappropriated;</t>

            <t>routing/topology information is available when needed.</t>
          </list> In conjunction, it is necessary to be assured of<list
            style="symbols">
            <t>the authenticity and legitimacy of the participants of the
            routing neighbor discovery process;</t>

            <t>the routing/topology information received was faithfully
            generated according to the protocol design.</t>
          </list>However, when trust cannot be fully vested through
        authentication of the principals alone, i.e., concerns of insider
        attack, assurance of the truthfulness and timeliness of the received
        routing/topology information is necessary. With regard to
        confidentiality, protecting the routing/topology information from
        eavesdropping or unauthorized exposure may be desirable in certain
        cases but is in itself less pertinent in general to the routing
        function.</t>

        <t>One of the main problems of synchronizing security states of sleepy
        nodes, as listed in the last subsection, lies in difficulties in
        authentication; these nodes may not have received in time the most
        recent update of security material. Similarly, the issues of minimal
        manual configuration, prolonged rollout and delayed addition of nodes,
        and network topology changes also complicate key management. Hence,
        routing in LLNs needs to bootstrap the authentication process and
        allow for flexible expiration scheme of authentication
        credentials.</t>

        <t>The vulnerability brought forth by some special-function nodes,
        e.g., LBRs, requires the assurance, particularly in a security
        context,<list style="symbols">
            <t>of the availability of communication channels and node
            resources;</t>

            <t>that the neighbor discovery process operates without
            undermining routing availability.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>There are other factors which are not part of a ROLL protocol but
        directly affecting its function. These factors include weaker barrier
        of accessing the data or security material stored on the nodes through
        physical means; therefore, the internal and external interfaces of a
        node need to be adequate for guarding the integrity, and possibly the
        confidentiality, of stored information, as well as the integrity of
        routing and route generation processes.</t>

        <t>Each individual system's use and environment will dictate how the
        above objectives are applied, including the choices of security
        services as well as the strengths of the mechanisms that must be
        implemented. The next two sections take a closer look at how the ROLL
        security objectives may be compromised and how those potential
        compromises can be countered.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="roll-threats" title="Threats and Attacks">
      <t>This section outlines general categories of threats under the CIA
      model and highlights the specific attacks in each of these categories
      for ROLL. As defined in <xref target="RFC4949"></xref>, a threat is "a
      potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a
      circumstance, capability, action, or event that could breach security
      and cause harm." An attack is "an assault on system security that
      derives from an intelligent threat, i.e., an intelligent act that is a
      deliberate attempt (especially in the sense of a method or technique) to
      evade security services and violate the security policy of a
      system."</t>

      <t>The subsequent subsections consider the threats and their realizing
      attacks that can cause security breaches under the CIA model to the
      routing assets and via the routing points of access identified in <xref
      target="routing-assets"></xref>. The assessment steps through the
      security concerns of each routing asset and looks at the attacks that
      can exploit routing points of access. The threats and attacks identified
      are based on the routing model analysis and associated review of the
      existing literature. The manifestation of the attacks is assumed to be
      from either inside or outside attackers, whose capabilities may be
      limited to node-equivalent or more sophisticated computing
      platforms.</t>

      <section anchor="confident-threat"
               title="Threats and Attacks on Confidentiality">
        <t>The assessment in <xref target="cia"></xref> indicates that routing
        information assets are exposed to confidentiality threats from all
        points of access. The confidentiality threat space is thus defined by
        the access to routing information achievable through the communication
        exchanges between routing nodes together with the direct access to
        information maintained within the nodes.</t>

        <section anchor="route-exch-expo" title="Routing Exchange Exposure">
          <t>Routing exchanges include both routing information as well as
          information associated with the establishment and maintenance of
          neighbor state information. As indicated in <xref
          target="routing-assets"></xref>, the associated routing information
          assets may also include device specific resource information, such
          as memory, remaining power, etc, that may be metrics of the routing
          protocol.</t>

          <t>The exposure of routing information exchanged will allow
          unauthorized sources to gain access to the content of the exchanges
          between communicating nodes. The exposure of neighbor state
          information will allow unauthorized sources to gain knowledge of
          communication links between routing nodes that are necessary to
          maintain routing information exchanges.</t>

          <t>The forms of attack that allow unauthorized access or exposure of
          routing exchange information include<list style="symbols">
              <t>Deliberate exposure (where one party to the routing exchange
              is able to independently provide unauthorized access);</t>

        <section anchor="route-info-expo"
                 title="Routing Information (Routes and Network Topology) Exposure">
          <t>Routes (which may be maintained in the form of the protocol
          forwarding table) and neighbor topology information are the products
          of the routing process that are stored within the node device
          databases.</t>

          <t>The exposure of this information will allow unauthorized sources
          to gain direct access to the configuration and connectivity of the
          network thereby exposing routing to targeted attacks on key nodes or
          links. Since routes and neighbor topology information is stored
          within the node device, threats or attacks on the confidentiality of
          the information will apply to the physical device including
          specified and unspecified internal and external interfaces.</t>

          <t>The forms of attack that allow unauthorized access or exposure of

      <section anchor="integ-threat" title="Threats and Attacks on Integrity">
        <t>The assessment in <xref target="cia"></xref> indicates that
        information and identity assets are exposed to integrity threats from
        all points of access. In other words, the integrity threat space is
        defined by the potential for exploitation introduced by access to
        assets available through routing exchanges and the on-device
        storage.</t>

        <section anchor="manipul" title="Routing Information Manipulation">
          <t>Manipulation of routing information that range from neighbor
          states to derived routes will allow unauthorized sources to
          influence the operation and convergence of the routing protocols and
          ultimately impact the forwarding decisions made in the network.
          Manipulation of topology and reachability information will allow
          unauthorized sources to influence the nodes with which routing
          information is exchanged and updated. The consequence of
          manipulating routing exchanges can thus lead to sub-optimality and
          fragmentation or partitioning of the network by restricting the
          universe of routers with which associations can be established and
          maintained. For example, being able to attract network traffic can
          make a blackhole attack more damaging.</t>

          <t>Falsification or misappropriation of node identity between
          routing participants opens the door for other attacks; it can also
          cause incorrect routing relationships to form and/or topologies to
          emerge. Routing attacks may also be mounted through less
          sophisticated node identity misappropriation in which the valid
          information broadcast or exchanged by a node is replayed without
          modification. The receipt of seemingly valid information that is

                 title="Communications Resource Disruption">
          <t>Attacks mounted against the communication channel resource assets
          needed by the routing protocol can be used as a means of disrupting
          its operation. However, while various forms of Denial of Service
          (DoS) attacks on the underlying transport subsystem will affect
          routing protocol exchanges and operation (for example physical layer
          RF jamming in a wireless network or link layer attacks), these
          attacks cannot be countered by the routing protocol. As such, the
          threats to the underlying transport network that supports routing is
          considered beyond the scope of the current document. Nonetheless,
          attacks on the subsystem will affect routing operation and so must
          be directly addressed within the underlying subsystem and its
          implemented protocol layers.</t>

        <section anchor="exhaust-resource" title="Node Resource Exhaustion">
          <t>A potential security threat to routing can arise from attempts to
          exhaust the node resource asset by initiating exchanges that can
          lead to the undue utilization or exhaustion of processing, memory or
          energy resources. The establishment and maintenance of routing
          neighbors opens the routing process to engagement and potential
          acceptance of multiple neighboring peers. Association information
          must be stored for each peer entity and for the wireless network
          operation provisions made to periodically update and reassess the
          associations. An introduced proliferation of apparent routing peers
          can therefore have a negative impact on node resources.</t>

          <t>Node resources may also be unduly consumed by the attackers
          attempting uncontrolled topology peering or routing exchanges,
          routing replays, or the generating of other data traffic floods.
          Beyond the disruption of communications channel resources, these
          threats may be able to exhaust node resources only where the
          engagements are able to proceed with the peer routing entities.
          Routing operation and network forwarding functions can thus be
          adversely impacted by node resources exhaustion that stems from

    <section anchor="counter-measur" title="Countermeasures">
      <t>By recognizing the characteristics of LLNs that may impact routing
      and identifying potential countermeasures, this framework provides the
      basis for developing capabilities within ROLL protocols to deter the
      identified attacks and mitigate the threats. The following subsections
      consider such countermeasures by grouping the attacks according to the
      classification of the CIA model so that associations with the necessary
      security services are more readily visible. However, the considerations
      here are more systematic than confined to means available only within
      routing; the next section will then distill and make recommendations
      appropriate for a secured ROLL protocol.</t>

      <section anchor="counter-confident-atk"
               title="Confidentiality Attack Countermeasures">
        <t>Attacks on confidentiality may be mounted at the level of the
        routing information assets, at the points of access associated with
        routing exchanges between nodes, or through device interface access.
        To gain access to routing/topology information, the attacker may rely
        on a compromised node that deliberately exposes the information during
        the routing exchange process, may rely on passive sniffing or analysis
        of routing traffic, or may attempt access through a component or
        device interface of a tampered routing node.</t>

        <section title="Countering Deliberate Exposure Attacks">
          <t>A deliberate exposure attack is one in which an entity that is
          party to the routing process or topology exchange allows the
          routing/topology information or generated route information to be
          exposed to an unauthorized entity during the exchange.</t>

          <t>A prerequisite to countering this type of confidentiality attacks
          associated with the routing/topology exchange is to ensure that the
          communicating nodes are authenticated prior to data encryption
          applied in the routing exchange. Authentication ensures that the
          nodes are who they claim to be even though it does not provide an
          indication of whether the node has been compromised.</t>

          <t>To prevent deliberate exposure, the process that communicating
          nodes use for establishing communication session keys must be
          peer-to-peer, between the routing initiating and responding nodes,
          so that neither node can independently weaken the confidentiality of
          the exchange without the knowledge of its communicating peer. A
          deliberate exposure attack will therefore require more overt and
          independent action on the part of the offending node.</t>

          <t>Note that the same measures which apply to securing
          routing/topology exchanges between operational nodes must also
          extend to field tools and other devices used in a deployed network
          where such devices can be configured to participate in routing
          exchanges.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Countering Sniffing Attacks">
          <t>A sniffing attack seeks to breach routing confidentiality through
          passive, direct analysis and processing of the information exchanges
          between nodes. A sniffing attack in an LLN that is not based on a
          physical device compromise will rely on the attacker attempting to
          directly derive information from the over-the-shared-medium
          routing/topology communication exchange (neighbor discovery
          exchanges may of necessity be conducted in the clear thus limiting
          the extent to which the information can be kept confidential).</t>

          <t>Sniffing attacks can be directly countered through the use of
          data encryption for all routing exchanges. Only when a validated and
          authenticated node association is completed will routing exchange be
          allowed to proceed using established session confidentiality keys
          and an agreed confidentiality algorithm. The level of security
          applied in providing confidentiality will determine the minimum
          requirement for an attacker mounting this passive security attack.
          The possibility of incorporating options for security level and
          algorithms is further considered in <xref
          target="match-needs"></xref>. Because of the resource constraints of
          LLN devices, symmetric (private) key session security will provide
          the best trade-off in terms of node and channel resource overhead
          and the level of security achieved. This will of course not preclude
          the use of asymmetric (public) key encryption during the session key
          establishment phase.</t>

          <t>As with the key establishment process, data encryption must
          include an authentication prerequisite to ensure that each node is
          implementing a level of security that prevents deliberate or
          inadvertent exposure. The authenticated key establishment will
          ensure that confidentiality is not compromised by providing the
          information to an unauthorized entity (see also <xref
          target="Huang2003"></xref>).</t>

          <t>Based on the current state of the art, a minimum 128-bit key
          length should be applied where robust confidentiality is demanded
          for routing protection. This session key shall be applied in
          conjunction with an encryption algorithm that has been publicly
          vetted and where applicable approved for the level of security
          desired. Algorithms such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
          <xref target="FIPS197"></xref>, adopted by the U.S. government, or
          Kasumi-Misty <xref target="Kasumi3gpp"></xref>, adopted by the 3GPP
          3rd generation wireless mobile consortium, are examples of
          symmetric-key algorithms capable of ensuring robust confidentiality
          for routing exchanges. The key length, algorithm and mode of
          operation will be selected as part of the overall security trade-off
          that also achieves a balance with the level of confidentiality
          afforded by the physical device in protecting the routing assets
          (see <xref target="counter-phy"></xref> below).</t>

          <t>As with any encryption algorithm, the use of ciphering
          synchronization parameters and limitations to the usage duration of
          established keys should be part of the security specification to
          reduce the potential for brute force analysis.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Countering Traffic Analysis">
          <t>Traffic analysis provides an indirect means of subverting
          confidentiality and gaining access to routing information by
          allowing an attacker to indirectly map the connectivity or flow
          patterns (including link-load) of the network from which other
          attacks can be mounted. The traffic analysis attack on a LLN,
          especially one founded on shared medium, may be passive and relying
          on the ability to read the immutable source/destination routing
          information that must remain unencrypted to permit network routing.
          Alternatively, attacks can be active through the injection of
          unauthorized discovery traffic into the network. By implementing
          authentication measures between communicating nodes, active traffic
          analysis attacks can be prevented within the LLN thereby reducing
          confidentiality vulnerabilities to those associated with passive
          analysis.</t>

          <t>One way in which passive traffic analysis attacks can be muted is
          through the support of load balancing that allows traffic to a given
          destination to be sent along diverse routing paths. Where the
          routing protocol supports load balancing along multiple links at
          each node, the number of routing permutations in a wide area network
          surges thus increasing the cost of traffic analysis. Network
          analysis through this passive attack will require a wider array of
          analysis points and additional processing on the part of the
          attacker. Note however that where network traffic is dispersed as a
          countermeasure there may be implications beyond routing with regard
          to general traffic confidentiality. Another approach to countering
          passive traffic analysis could be for nodes to maintain constant
          amount of traffic to different destinations through the generation
          of arbitrary traffic flows; the drawback of course would be the
          consequent overhead. In LLNs, the diverse radio connectivity and
          dynamic links (including potential frequency hopping), or a complex
          wiring system hidden from sight, will help to further mitigate
          traffic analysis attacks when load balancing is also
          implemented.</t>

          <t>The only means of fully countering a traffic analysis attack is
          through the use of tunneling (encapsulation) where encryption is
          applied across the entirety of the original packet
          source/destination addresses. With tunneling there is a further
          requirement that the encapsulating intermediate nodes apply an
          additional layer of routing so that traffic arrives at the
          destination through dynamic routes. For some LLNs, memory and
          processing constraints as well as the limitations of the
          communication channel will preclude both the additional routing
          traffic overhead and the node implementation required for tunneling
          countermeasures to traffic analysis.</t>

        <section anchor="counter-phy"
                 title="Countering Physical Device Compromise">
          <t><xref target="roll-threats"></xref> identified that many threats
          to the routing functionality may involve compromised devices. For
          the sake of completeness, this subsection examines how to counter
          physical device compromise, without restricting the consideration to
          only those methods and apparatuses available to a LLN routing
          protocol.</t>

          <t>Given the distributed nature of LLNs and the varying environment
          of deployed devices, confidentiality of routing assets and points of
          access may rely heavily on the security of the routing devices. One
          means of precluding attacks on the physical device is to prevent
          physical access to the node through other external security means.
          However, given the environment in which many LLNs operate,
          preventing unauthorized access to the physical device cannot be
          assured. Countermeasures must therefore be employed at the device
          and component level so that routing/topology or neighbor information
          and stored route information cannot be accessed even if physical
          access to the node is obtained.</t>

          <t>With the physical device in the possession of an attacker,
          unauthorized information access can be attempted by probing internal
          interfaces or device components. Device security must therefore move
          to preventing the reading of device processor code or memory
          locations without the appropriate security keys and in preventing
          the access to any information exchanges occurring between individual
          components. Information access will then be restricted to external
          interfaces in which confidentiality, integrity and authentication
          measures can be applied.</t>

          <t>To prevent component information access, deployed routing devices
          must ensure that their implementation avoids address or data buses
          being connected to external general purpose input/output (GPIO)
          pins. Beyond this measure, an important component interface to be
          protected against attack is the Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) <xref
          target="IEEE1149.1"></xref> interface used for component and
          populated circuit board testing after manufacture. To provide
          security on the routing devices, components should be employed that
          allow fuses on the JTAG interfaces to be blown to disable access.
          This will raise the bar on unauthorized component information access
          within a captured device.</t>

          <t>At the device level a key component information exchange is
          between the microprocessor and its associated external memory. While
          encryption can be implemented to secure data bus exchanges, the use
          of integrated physical packaging which avoids inter-component
          exchanges (other than secure external device exchanges) will
          increase routing security against a physical device interface
          attack. With an integrated package and disabled internal component
          interfaces, the level of physical device security can be controlled
          by managing the degree to which the device packaging is protected
          against expert physical decomposition and analysis.</t>

          <t>The device package should be hardened such that attempts to
          remove the integrated components will result in damage to access
          interfaces, ports or pins that prevent retrieval of code or stored
          information. The degree of Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) or
          Printed Circuit Board (PCB) package security through manufacture can
          be selected as a trade-off or desired security consistent with the
          level of security achieved by measures applied for other routing
          assets and points of access. With package hardening and restricted
          component access countermeasures, the security level will be raised
          to that provided by measures employed at the external communications
          interfaces.</t>

          <t>Another area of node interface vulnerability is that associated
          with interfaces provided for remote software or firmware upgrades.
          This may impact both routing information and routing/topology
          exchange security where it leads to unauthorized upgrade or change
          to the routing protocol running on a given node as this type of
          attack can allow for the execution of compromised or intentionally
          malicious routing code on multiple nodes. Countermeasures to this
          device interface confidentiality attack needs to be addressed in the
          larger context of node remote access security. This will ensure not
          only the authenticity of the provided code (including routing
          protocol) but that the process is initiated by an authorized
          (authenticated) entity. For example, digital signing of firmware by
          an authorized entity will provide an appropriate countermeasure.</t>

          <t>The above identified countermeasures against attacks on routing
          information confidentiality through internal device interface
          compromise must be part of the larger LLN system security as they
          cannot be addressed within the routing protocol itself. Similarly,
          the use of field tools or other devices that allow explicit access
          to node information must implement security mechanisms to ensure
          that routing information can be protected against unauthorized
          access. These protections will also be external to the routing
          protocol and hence not part of ROLL.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="counter-remote"
                 title="Countering Remote Device Access Attacks">
          <t>Where LLN nodes are deployed in the field, measures are
          introduced to allow for remote retrieval of routing data and for
          software or field upgrades. These paths create the potential for a
          device to be remotely accessed across the network or through a
          provided field tool. In the case of network management a node can be
          directly requested to provide routing tables and neighbor
          information.</t>

          <t>To ensure confidentiality of the node routing information against
          attacks through remote access, any local or remote device requesting
          routing information must be authenticated to ensure authorized
          access. Since remote access is not invoked as part of a routing
          protocol security of routing information stored on the node against
          remote access will not be addressable as part of the routing
          protocol.</t>

        Manipulation can occur in the form of falsification attack and
        physical compromise. To be effective, the following development
        considers the two aspects of falsification, namely, the unauthorized
        modifications and the overclaiming and misclaiming content. The
        countering of physical compromise was considered in the previous

        <section title="Countering Unauthorized Modification Attacks">
          <t>Unauthorized modifications may occur in the form of altering the

          integrity of the rest of the information is protected, e.g., through
          well-studied cryptographic mechanisms.</t>

          <t>Unauthorized modifications may also occur in the form of

          or damage assets whose access is controlled through identity. In
          routing, an identity attacker can illegitimately participate in
          routing exchanges, distribute false routing information, or cause an
          invalid outcome of a routing process.</t>

          <t>A perpetrator of Sybil attacks assumes multiple identities. The
          result is not only an amplification of the damage to routing, but
          extension to new areas, e.g., where geographic distribution is
          explicit or implicit an asset to an application running on the LLN,
          for example, the LBR in a P2MP or MP2P LLN.</t>

          <t>The countering of identity attacks need to ensure the
          authenticity and liveliness of the parties of a message exchange.
          The means may be through the use of shared key or public key based
          authentication scheme. On the one hand, the large-scale nature of
          the LLNs makes the network-wide shared key scheme undesirable from a
          security perspective; on the other hand, public-key based approaches
          generally require more computational resources. Each system will
          need to make trade-off decisions based on its security requirements.

          commonly used for countering replay, e.g., with a counter. On the
          other hand, the choice should take into account how a particular
          mechanism is made available in a LLN. For example, many LLNs have a
          central source of time and have it distributed by relaying, such
          that secured time distribution becomes a prerequisite of using
          timestamping to counter replay.</t>

          <t>Consistent with the end-to-end principle of communications, such
          an attack can only be fully addressed through measures operating
          directly between the routing entities themselves or by means of
          external entities able to access and independently analyze the
          routing information. Verification of the authenticity and liveliness
          of the routing entities can therefore only provide a limited counter
          against internal (Byzantine) node attacks.</t>

          <t>For link state routing protocols where information is flooded
          with, for example, areas (OSPF <xref target="RFC2328"></xref>) or
          levels (ISIS <xref target="RFC1142"></xref>), countermeasures can be
          directly applied by the routing entities through the processing and
          comparison of link state information received from different peers.
          By comparing the link information from multiple sources decisions
          can be made by a routing node or external entity with regard to
          routing information validity; see Chapter 2 of <xref
          target="Perlman1988"></xref> for a discussion on flooding
          attacks.</t>

          <t>For distance vector protocols where information is aggregated at
          each routing node it is not possible for nodes to directly detect
          Byzantine information manipulation attacks from the routing
          information exchange. In such cases, the routing protocol must
          include and support indirect communications exchanges between
          non-adjacent routing peers to provide a secondary channel for
          performing routing information validation. S-RIP <xref
          target="Wan2004"></xref> is an example of the implementation of this
          type of dedicated routing protocol security where the correctness of
          aggregate distance vector information can only be validated by
          initiating confirmation exchanges directly between nodes that are
          not routing neighbors.</t>

          <t>Alternatively, an entity external to the routing protocol would
          be required to collect and audit routing information exchanges to
          detect the Byzantine attack. In the context of the current security
          framework, any protection against Byzantine routing information
          attacks will need to be directly included within the mechanisms of
          the ROLL routing protocol. This can be implemented where such an
          attack is considered relevant even within the physical device
          protections discussed in <xref target="counter-phy"></xref></t>

               title="Availability Attack Countermeasures">
        <t>As alluded to before, availability requires that routing
        information exchanges and forwarding mechanisms be available when
        needed so as to guarantee a proper functioning of the network. This
        may, e.g., include the correct operation of routing information and
        neighbor state information exchanges, among others. We will highlight
        the key features of the security threats along with typical
        countermeasures to prevent or at least mitigate them. We will also
        note that an availability attack may be facilitated by an identity
        attack as well as a replay attack, as was addressed in <xref
        target="counter-sybil"></xref> and <xref
        target="counter-replay"></xref>, respectively.</t>

        <section title="Countering HELLO Flood Attacks and ACK Spoofing Attacks">
          <t>HELLO Flood <xref target="Karlof2003"></xref>,<xref
          target="I-D.suhopark-hello-wsn"></xref> and ACK Spoofing attacks are
          different but highly related forms of attacking a LLN. They
          essentially lead nodes to believe that suitable routes are available
          even though they are not and hence constitute a serious availability
          attack.</t>

          <t>The origin of facilitating a HELLO flood attack lies in the fact
          that many routing protocols require nodes to send HELLO packets
          either upon joining or in regular intervals so as to announce or
          confirm their existence to the network. Those nodes that receive the
          HELLO packet assume that they are indeed neighbors.</t>

          <t>With this in mind, a malicious node can send or replay HELLO
          packets using, e.g., a higher transmission power. That creates the
          false illusion of being a neighbor to an increased number of nodes
          in the network, thereby effectively increasing its unidirectional
          neighborhood cardinality. The high quality of the falsely advertised
          link may coerce nodes to route data via the malicious node. However,
          those affected nodes, for which the malicious node is in fact
          unreachable, never succeed in their delivery and the packets are
          effectively dropped. The symptoms are hence similar to those of a
          sinkhole, wormhole and selective forwarding attack.</t>

          <t>A malicious HELLO flood attack clearly distorts the network
          topology. It thus affects protocols building and maintaining the
          network topology as well as routing protocols as such, since the
          attack is primarily targeted on protocols that require sharing of
          information for topology maintenance or flow control.</t>

          <t>To counter HELLO flood attacks, several mutually non-exclusive
          methods are feasible:<list style="symbols">
              <t>restricting neighborhood cardinality;</t>

              <t>facilitating multipath routing;</t>

              <t>verifying bidirectionality.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Restricting the neighborhood cardinality prevents malicious nodes
          from having an extended set of neighbors beyond some tolerated
          threshold and thereby preventing topologies to be built where
          malicious nodes have a false neighborhood set. Furthermore, as shown
          in <xref target="I-D.suhopark-hello-wsn"></xref>, if the routing
          protocol supports multiple paths from a sensing node towards several
          LBRs then HELLO flood attacks can also be diminished; however, the
          energy-efficiency of such approach is clearly sub-optimal. Finally,
          verifying that the link is truly bidirectional by means of, e.g., an
          ACK handshake and appropriate security measures ensures that a
          communication link is only established if not only the affected node
          is within range of the malicious node but also vice versa. Whilst
          this does not really eliminate the problem of HELLO flooding, it
          greatly reduces the number of affected nodes and the probability of
          such an attack succeeding.</t>

          <t>As for the latter, the adversary may spoof the ACK messages to
          convince the affected node that the link is truly bidirectional and
          thereupon drop, tunnel or selectively forward messages. Such ACK
          spoofing attack is possible if the malicious node has a receiver
          which is significantly more sensitive than that of a normal node,
          thereby effectively extending its range. Since an ACK spoofing
          attack facilitates a HELLO flood attack, similar countermeasure are
          applicable here. Viable counter and security measures for both
          attacks have been exposed in <xref
          target="I-D.suhopark-hello-wsn"></xref>.</t>

        <section title="Countering Overload Attacks">
          <t>Overload attacks are a form of DoS attack in that a malicious
          node overloads the network with irrelevant traffic, thereby draining
          the nodes' energy store quicker, when the nodes rely on battery or
          energy scavenging. It thus significantly shortens the lifetime of
          networks of battery nodes and constitutes another serious
          availability attack.</t>

          <t>With energy being one of the most precious assets of LLNs,
          targeting its availability is a fairly obvious attack. Another way
          of depleting the energy of a LLN node is to have the malicious node
          overload the network with irrelevant traffic. This impacts
          availability since certain routes get congested which<list
              style="symbols">
              <t>renders them useless for affected nodes and data can hence
              not be delivered;</t>

              <t>makes routes longer as shortest path algorithms work with the
              congested network;</t>

              <t>depletes battery and energy scavenging nodes quicker and thus
              shortens the network's availability at large.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Overload attacks can be countered by deploying a series of
          mutually non-exclusive security measures:<list style="symbols">
              <t>introduce quotas on the traffic rate each node is allowed to
              send;</t>

              <t>isolate nodes which send traffic above a certain threshold
              based on system operation characteristics;</t>

              <t>allow only trusted data to be received and forwarded.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>As for the first one, a simple approach to minimize the harmful
          impact of an overload attack is to introduce traffic quotas. This
          prevents a malicious node from injecting a large amount of traffic
          into the network, even though it does not prevent said node from
          injecting irrelevant traffic at all. Another method is to isolate
          nodes from the network at the network layer once it has been
          detected that more traffic is injected into the network than allowed
          by a prior set or dynamically adjusted threshold. Finally, if
          communication is sufficiently secured, only trusted nodes can
          receive and forward traffic which also lowers the risk of an
          overload attack.</t>

          <t>Receiving nodes that validate signatures and sending nodes that
          encrypt messages need to be cautious of cryptographic processing
          usage when validating signatures and encrypting messages. Where
          feasible, certificates should be validated prior to use of the
          associated keys to counter potential resource overloading attacks.
          The associated design decision needs to also consider that the
          validation process requires resources and thus itself could be
          exploited for attacks. Alternatively, resource management limits can
          be placed on routing security processing events (see the comment in
          Section 6, paragraph 4, of <xref target="RFC5751"></xref>).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Countering Selective Forwarding Attacks">
          <t>Selective forwarding attacks are another form of DoS attack which
          impacts the routing path availability.</t>

          <t>An insider malicious node basically blends neatly in with the
          network but then may decide to forward and/or manipulate certain
          packets. If all packets are dropped, then this attacker is also
          often referred to as a "black hole". Such a form of attack is
          particularly dangerous if coupled with sinkhole attacks since
          inherently a large amount of traffic is attracted to the malicious
          node and thereby causing significant damage. In a shared medium, an
          outside malicious node would selectively jam overheard data flows,
          where the thus caused collisions incur selective forwarding.</t>

          <t>Selective Forwarding attacks can be countered by deploying a
          series of mutually non-exclusive security measures:<list
              style="symbols">
              <t>multipath routing of the same message over disjoint
              paths;</t>

              <t>dynamically select the next hop from a set of candidates.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The first measure basically guarantees that if a message gets
          lost on a particular routing path due to a malicious selective
          forwarding attack, there will be another route which successfully
          delivers the data. Such method is inherently suboptimal from an
          energy consumption point of view. The second method basically
          involves a constantly changing routing topology in that next-hop
          routers are chosen from a dynamic set in the hope that the number of
          malicious nodes in this set is negligible. A routing protocol that
          allows for disjoint routing paths may also be useful.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Countering Sinkhole Attacks">
          <t>In sinkhole attacks, the malicious node manages to attract a lot
          of traffic mainly by advertising the availability of high-quality
          links even though there are none <xref target="Karlof2003"></xref>.
          It hence constitutes a serious attack on availability.</t>

          <t>The malicious node creates a sinkhole by attracting a large
          amount of, if not all, traffic from surrounding neighbors by
          advertising in and outwards links of superior quality. Affected
          nodes hence eagerly route their traffic via the malicious node
          which, if coupled with other attacks such as selective forwarding,
          may lead to serious availability and security breaches. Such an
          attack can only be executed by an inside malicious node and is
          generally very difficult to detect. An ongoing attack has a profound
          impact on the network topology and essentially becomes a problem of
          flow control.</t>

          <t>Sinkhole attacks can be countered by deploying a series of
          mutually non-exclusive security measures:<list style="symbols">
              <t>use geographical insights for flow control;</t>

              <t>isolate nodes which receive traffic above a certain
              threshold;</t>

              <t>dynamically pick up next hop from set of candidates;</t>

              <t>allow only trusted data to be received and forwarded.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Whilst most of these countermeasures have been discussed before,
          the use of geographical information deserves further attention.
          Essentially, if geographic positions of nodes are available, then
          the network can assure that data is actually routed towards the
          intended destination and not elsewhere. On the other hand,
          geographic position is a sensitive information that has security
          and/or privacy consequences (see <xref target="conff"></xref>).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Countering Wormhole Attacks">
          <t>In wormhole attacks at least two malicious nodes shortcut or
          divert the usual routing path by means of a low-latency out-of-band
          channel <xref target="Karlof2003"></xref>. This changes the
          availability of certain routing paths and hence constitutes a
          serious security breach.</t>

          <t>Essentially, two malicious insider nodes use another, more
          powerful, transmitter to communicate with each other and thereby
          distort the would-be-agreed routing path. This distortion could
          involve shortcutting and hence paralyzing a large part of the
          network; it could also involve tunneling the information to another
          region of the network where there are, e.g., more malicious nodes
          available to aid the intrusion or where messages are replayed, etc.
          In conjunction with selective forwarding, wormhole attacks can
          create race conditions which impact topology maintenance, routing
          protocols as well as any security suits built on "time of check" and
          "time of use".</t>

          <t>Wormhole attacks are very difficult to detect in general but can
          be mitigated using similar strategies as already outlined above in
          the context of sinkhole attacks.</t>

    <section anchor="roll-sec-features" title="ROLL Security Features">
      <t>The assessments and analysis in <xref target="roll-threats"></xref>
      examined all areas of threats and attacks that could impact routing, and
      the countermeasures presented in <xref target="counter-measur"></xref>
      were reached without confining the consideration to means only available
      to routing. This section puts the results into perspective and provides
      a framework for addressing the derived set of security objectives that
      must be met by the routing protocol(s) specified by the ROLL Working
      Group. It bears emphasizing that the target here is a generic, universal
      form of the protocol(s) specified and the normative keywords are mainly
      to convey the relative level of importance or urgency of the features
      specified.</t>

      <t>In this view, 'MUST' is used to define the requirements that are
      specific to the routing protocol and that are essential for an LLN
      routing protocol to ensure that routing operation can be maintained.
      Adherence to MUST requirements is needed to directly counter attacks
      that can affect the routing operation (such as those that can impact
      maintained or derived routing/forwarding tables). 'SHOULD' is used to
      define requirements that counter indirect routing attacks where such
      attacks that do not of themselves affect routing but can assist an
      attacker in focusing its attack resources to impact network operation
      (such as DoS targeting of key forwarding nodes). 'MAY' covers optional
      requirements that can further enhance security by increasing the space
      over which an attacker must operate or the resources that must be
      applied. While in support of routing security, where appropriate, these
      requirements may also be addressed beyond the network routing protocol
      at other system communications layers.</t>

      <t>The first part of this section, <xref target="conff"></xref> to <xref
      target="avaf"></xref>, is a prescription of ROLL security features of
      measures that can be addressed as part of the routing protocol itself.
      As routing is one component of a LLN system, the actual strength of the
      security services afforded to it should be made to conform to each
      system's security policy; how a design may address the needs of the
      urban, industrial, home automation, and building automation application
      domains also needs to be considered. The second part of this section,
      <xref target="keymanage"></xref> and <xref target="match-needs"></xref>,
      discusses system security aspects that may impact routing but that also
      require considerations beyond the routing protocol, as well as potential
      approaches.</t>

      <t>If a LLN employs multicast and/or anycast, these alternative
      communications modes MUST be secured with the same routing security
      services specified in this section. Furthermore, irrespective of the
      modes of communication, nodes MUST provide adequate physical tamper
      resistance commensurate with the particular application domain
      environment to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of
      stored routing information.</t>

      <section anchor="conff" title="Confidentiality Features">
        <t>With regard to confidentiality, protecting the routing/topology
        information from eavesdropping or unauthorized exposure is not
        directly essential to maintaining the routing function. Breaches of
        confidentiality may lead to other attacks or the focusing of an
        attacker's resources (see <xref target="confident-threat"></xref>) but
        does not of itself directly undermine the operation of the routing
        function. However, to protect against, and improve vulnerability
        against other more direct attacks, routing information confidentiality
        should be protected. Thus, a secured ROLL protocol<list
            style="symbols">
            <t>MUST implement payload encryption;</t>

            <t>MUST provide privacy when geographic information is used (see,
            e.g., <xref target="RFC3693"></xref>);</t>

            <t>MAY provide tunneling;</t>

            <t>MAY provide load balancing.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Where confidentiality is incorporated into the routing exchanges,
        encryption algorithms and key lengths need to be specified in
        accordance of the level of protection dictated by the routing protocol
        and the associated application domain transport network. In terms of
        the life time of the keys, the opportunity to periodically change the
        encryption key increases the offered level of security for any given
        implementation. However, where strong cryptography is employed,
        physical, procedural, and logical data access protection
        considerations may have more significant impact on cryptoperiod
        selection than algorithm and key size factors. Nevertheless, in
        general, shorter cryptoperiods, during which a single key is applied,
        will enhance security.</t>

        <t>Given the mandatory protocol requirement to implement routing node
        authentication as part of routing integrity (see <xref
        target="intf"></xref>), key exchanges may be coordinated as part of
        the integrity verification process. This provides an opportunity to
        increase the frequency of key exchange and shorten the cryptoperiod as
        a complement to the key length and encryption algorithm required for a
        given application domain. For LLNs, the coordination of
        confidentiality key management with the implementation of node device
        authentication can thus reduce the overhead associated with supporting
        data confidentiality. If a new ciphering key is concurrently generated
        or updated in conjunction with the mandatory authentication exchange
        occurring with each routing peer association, signaling exchange
        overhead can be reduced.</t>

      <section anchor="intf" title="Integrity Features">
        <t>The integrity of routing information provides the basis for
        ensuring that the function of the routing protocol is achieved and
        maintained. To protect integrity, a secured ROLL protocol<list
            style="symbols">
            <t>MUST provide and verify message integrity (including integrity

            routing information to protect against intentional or
            unintentional Byzantine-induced network anomalies.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>In conjunction with the integrity protection requirements, a
        secured ROLL protocol SHOULD log, against the offending node, any
        security failure that occurs after a valid integrity check. The record
        of such failures (as may result, for example, from incorrect security
        policy configuration) can provide the basis for nodes to avoid
        initiating routing access to the offender or used for further system
        countermeasures in the case of potential insider attacks. All
        integrity security failures SHOULD be logged, where feasible, but
        cannot be reliably considered as against the offending source(s).</t>

        <t>Depending on the nature of the routing protocol, e.g., distance
        vector or link state, additional measures may be necessary when the
        validity of the routing information is of concern. In the most basic
        form, verification of routing peer authenticity and liveliness can be
        used to build a "chain of trust" along the path the routing
        information flows, such that network-wide information is validated
        through the concatenation of trust established at each individual
        routing peer exchange. This is particularly important in the case of
        distance vector-based routing protocols, where information is updated
        at intermediate nodes, In such cases, there are no direct means within
        routing for a receiver to verify the validity of the routing
        information beyond the current exchange; as such, nodes would need to
        be able to communicate and request information from non-adjacent peers
        (see <xref target="Wan2004"></xref>) to provide information integrity
        assurances. With link state-based protocols, on the other hand,
        routing information can be signed at the source thus providing a means
        for validating information that originates beyond a routing peer.
        Therefore, where necessary, a secured ROLL protocol MAY use security
        auditing mechanisms that are external to routing to verify the
        validity of the routing information content exchanged among routing
        peers.</t>

      <section anchor="keymanage" title="Security Key Management">
        <t>The functioning of the security services requires keys and
        credentials. Therefore, even though not directly a ROLL security
        requirement, a LLN MUST have a process for key and credential
        distribution, as well as secure storage within the associated devices
        (including use of trusted platform modules where feasible and
        appropriate to the operating environment). A LLN is encouraged to have
        automatic procedures for the revocation and replacement of maintained
        security credentials.</t>

        <t>Individual routing peer associations and signaling exchanges will
        require the generation and use of keys that may be derived from public
        key exchanges or obtained through other device configuration means.
        Correspondingly, the routing protocol(s) specified by the ROLL Working
        Group SHOULD employ the provision of key management mechanisms
        consistent with the guidelines given in <xref
        target="RFC4107"></xref>. Based on that RFC's recommendations, many
        LLNs, particularly given the intended scale and ad hoc device
        associations, will satisfy the requirement for supporting automated
        key management in conjunction with the routing protocol operation.
        These automated routing session keys may be derived from pre-stored
        security credentials or other authenticated key management
        mechanisms.</t>

        <t>The use of a public key infrastructure (PKI), where feasible, can
        be used to support authenticated key management and the distribution
        of routing security keying material. Note that where the option for a
        PKI is supported for security of the routing protocol itself, the
        routing protocol MUST include provisions for public key certificates
        to be included or referenced within routing messages to allow a node's
        public key to be shared with communicating peers. Even if the
        certificate itself is not distributed by the node, there needs to be a
        mechanism to inform the receiving node where to find the certificate
        and obtain associated validation information; see <xref
        target="RFC3029"></xref> for an example of the kind of localized PKI
        support that may be applied in a given LLN environment. Where PKI
        systems are not feasible, the key management system MUST support means
        for secure configuration, device authentication, and adherence to
        secure key wrapping principles for the secure distribution and update
        of device keys.</t>

        <t>LLN routing protocols SHOULD be designed to allow the use of
        existing and validated key management schemes. As part of the LLN
        optimization, these schemes may be independent of the routing protocol
        and part of the broader LLN system security specifications. Where key
        management is defined separate from the routing protocol security, LLN
        application domains can appropriately employ IETF-standard key
        management specifications. Established key management solutions such
        as IKE <xref target="RFC5996"></xref> or MIKEY <xref
        target="RFC3830"></xref>, which supports several alternative private,
        public, or Diffie-Hellman key distribution methods (see <xref
        target="RFC5197"></xref>), can thus be adapted for use in LLNs. Group
        key management and distribution methods may also be developed based on
        the architecture principles defined in MSEC <xref
        target="RFC4046"></xref>.</t>

      <section anchor="match-needs"
               title="Consideration on Matching Application Domain Needs">
        <t>Providing security within an LLN requires considerations that
        extend beyond routing security to the broader LLN application domain
        security implementation. In other words, as routing is one component
        of a LLN system, the actual strength of the implemented security
        algorithms for the routing protocol MUST be made to conform to the
        system's target level of security. The development so far takes into
        account collectively the impacts of the issues gathered from <xref
        target="RFC5548"></xref>, <xref target="RFC5673"></xref>, <xref
        target="RFC5826"></xref>, and <xref target="RFC5867"></xref>. The
        following two subsections first consider from an architectural
        perspective how the security design of a ROLL protocol may be made to
        adapt to the four application domains, and then examine mechanisms and
        protocol operations issues.</t>

        <section anchor="roll-sec-arch" title="Security Architecture">
          <t>The first challenge for a ROLL protocol security design is to
          have an architecture that can adequately address a set of very
          diversified needs. It is mainly a consequence of the fact that there
          are both common and non-overlapping requirements from the four
          application domains, while, conceivably, each individual application
          will present yet its own unique constraints.</t>

          <t>For a ROLL protocol, the security requirements defined in <xref
          target="conff"></xref> to <xref target="keymanage"></xref> can be
          addressed at two levels: 1) through measures implemented directly
          within the routing protocol itself and initiated and controlled by
          the routing protocol entities; or 2) through measures invoked on
          behalf of the routing protocol entities but implemented within the
          part of the network over which the protocol exchanges occur.</t>

          <t>Where security is directly implemented as part of the routing
          protocol the security requirements configured by the user (system
          administrator) will operate independent of the lower layers. OSPFv2
          <xref target="RFC2328"></xref> is an example of such an approach in
          which security parameters are exchanged and assessed within the
          routing protocol messages. In this case, the mechanism may be, e.g.,
          a header containing security material of configurable security
          primitives in the fashion of OSPFv2 or RIPv2 <xref
          target="RFC2453"></xref>. Where IPsec <xref target="RFC4301"></xref>
          is employed to secure the network, the included protocol-specific
          (OSPF or RIP) security elements are in addition to and independent
          of those at the network layer. In the case of LLNs or other networks
          where system security mandates protective mechanisms at other lower
          layers of the network, security measures implemented as part of the
          routing protocol will be redundant to security measures implemented
          elsewhere as part of the protocol stack.</t>

          <t>Security mechanisms built into the routing protocol can ensure
          that all desired countermeasures can be directly addressed by the
          protocol all the way to the endpoint of the routing exchange. In
          particular, routing protocol Byzantine attacks by a compromised node
          that retains valid network security credentials can only be detected
          at the level of the information exchanged within the routing
          protocol. Such attacks aimed at the manipulation of the routing
          information can only be fully addressed through measures operating
          directly between the routing entities themselves or external
          entities able to access and analyze the routing information (see
          discussion in <xref target="counter-byzantine"></xref>).</t>

          <t>On the other hand, it is more desirable from a LLN device
          perspective that the ROLL protocol is integrated into the framework
          of an overall system architecture where the security facility may be
          shared by different applications and/or across layers for
          efficiency, and where security policy and configurations can be
          consistently specified. See, for example, considerations made in
          RIPng <xref target="RFC2080"></xref> or the approach presented in
          <xref target="Messerges2003"></xref>.</t>

          <t>Where the routing protocol is able to rely on security measures
          configured within other layers of the protocol stack, greater system
          efficiency can be realized by avoiding potentially redundant
          security. Relying on an open trust model <xref
          target="Messerges2003"></xref>, the security requirements of the
          routing protocol can be more flexibly met at different layers of the
          transport network; measures that must be applied to protect the
          communications network are concurrently able to provide the needed
          routing protocol protection.</t>

          <t>For example, where a given security encryption scheme is deemed
          the appropriate standard for network confidentiality of data
          exchanges at the link layer, that level of security is directly
          provided to routing protocol exchanges across the local link.
          Similarly, where a given authentication procedure is stipulated as
          part of the standard required for authenticating network traffic,
          that security provision can then meet the requirement needed for
          authentication of routing exchanges. In addition, in the context of
          the different LLN application domains, the level of security
          specified for routing can and should be consistent with that
          considered appropriate for protecting the network within the given
          environment.</t>

          <t>A ROLL protocol MUST be made flexible by a design that offers the
          configuration facility so that the user (network administrator) can
          choose the security settings that match the application's needs.
          Furthermore, in the case of LLNs that flexibility SHOULD extend to
          allowing the routing protocol security requirements to be met by
          measures applied at different protocol layers, provided the
          identified requirements are collectively met.</t>

          <t>Since Byzantine attacks that can affect the validity of the
          information content exchanged between routing entities can only be
          directly countered at the routing protocol level, the ROLL protocol
          MAY support mechanisms for verifying routing data validity that
          extends beyond the chain of trust created through device
          authentication. This protocol-specific security mechanism SHOULD be
          made optional within the protocol allowing it to be invoked
          according to the given routing protocol and application domain and
          as selected by the system user. All other ROLL security mechanisms
          needed to meet the above identified routing security requirements
          can be flexibly implemented within the transport network (at the IP
          network layer or higher or lower protocol layers(s)) according to
          the particular application domain and user network
          configuration.</t>

          <t>Based on device capabilities and the spectrum of operating
          environments it would be difficult for a single fixed security
          design to be applied to address the diversified needs of the urban,
          industrial, home, and building ROLL application domains, and
          foreseeable others, without forcing a very low common denominator
          set of requirements. On the other hand, providing four individual
          domain designs that attempt to a priori match each individual domain
          is also very unlikely to provide a suitable answer given the degree
          of network variability even within a given domain; furthermore, the
          type of link layers in use within each domain also influences the
          overall security.</t>

          <t>Instead, the framework implementation approach recommended is for
          optional, routing protocol-specific measures that can be applied
          separately from, or together with, flexible transport network
          mechanisms. Protocol-specific measures include the specification of
          valid parameter ranges, increments and/or event frequencies that can
          be verified by individual routing devices. In addition to deliberate
          attacks this allows basic protocol sanity checks against
          unintentional mis-configuration. Transport network mechanisms would
          include out-of-band communications that may be defined to allow an
          external entity to request and process individual device information
          as a means to effecting an external verification of the derived
          network routing information to identify the existence of intentional
          or unintentional network anomalies.</t>

          <t>This approach allows countermeasures against internal attacks to
          be applied in environments where applicable threats exist. At the
          same time, it allows routing protocol security to be supported
          through measures implemented within the transport network that are
          consistent with available system resources and commensurate and
          consistent with the security level and strength applied in the
          particular application domain networks.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="roll-sec-mech" title="Mechanisms and Operations">
          <t>With an architecture allowing different configurations to meet
          the application domain needs, the task is then to find suitable
          mechanisms. For example, one of the main problems of synchronizing
          security states of sleepy nodes, as listed in the last subsection,
          lies in difficulties in authentication; these nodes may not have
          received in time the most recent update of security material.
          Similarly, the issues of minimal manual configuration, prolonged
          rollout and delayed addition of nodes, and network topology changes
          also complicate security management. In many cases the ROLL protocol
          may need to bootstrap the authentication process and allow for a
          flexible expiration scheme of authentication credentials. This
          exemplifies the need for the coordination and interoperation between
          the requirements of the ROLL routing protocol and that of the system
          security elements.</t>

          <t>Similarly, the vulnerability brought forth by some
          special-function nodes, e.g., LBRs requires the assurance,
          particularly, of the availability of communication channels and node
          resources, or that the neighbor discovery process operates without
          undermining routing availability.</t>

          <t>There are other factors which are not part of a ROLL routing
          protocol but which can still affect its operation. These include
          elements such as weaker barrier to accessing the data or security
          material stored on the nodes through physical means; therefore, the
          internal and external interfaces of a node need to be adequate for
          guarding the integrity, and possibly the confidentiality, of stored
          information, as well as the integrity of routing and route
          generation processes.</t>

          <t><xref target="Fig3"></xref> provides an overview of the larger
          context of system security and the relationship between ROLL
          requirements and measures and those that relate to the LLN

      target="I-D.ietf-roll-rpl"></xref> as an illustration of the application
      of the LLN security framework. The intent of this section is to provide
      an introduction or guide to how the security framework developed in this
      document could be applied in developing security measures and mechanisms
      for a given LLN routing protocol. In this case, the application is
      targeted to RPL , the first LLN routing protocol introduced by the ROLL
      WG. The intent therefore is not a security analysis, which has to be
      done in the context of the specifics of the given routing protocol, but
      rather to show how the framework can be applied to focus the
      protocol-specific security development effort.</t>

      <t>Specializing the approach used in <xref
      target="routing-assets"></xref>, <xref target="Fig4"></xref> gives a
      data flow diagram representation of RPL to show the routing "assets" and

      <t>From <xref target="Fig4"></xref>, it is seen that threats to the
      proper operation of RPL are realized through attacks on its DIO, DIS,
      and DAO messages, as well as on the information the protocol places on
      the IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Option Header <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-6man-rpl-option"></xref> and Routing Header <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-6man-rpl-routing-header"></xref>. As set forth in <xref
      target="conff"></xref> to <xref target="keymanage"></xref>, the base
      security requirements concern message integrity, authenticity and
      liveliness of the principals of a connection, and protection against
      message replay; message encryption may be desirable. The security
      objectives for RPL are therefore to ensure that</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>participants of the DIO, DIS, and DAO message exchanges are
          authentic;</t>

          <t>the received DIO, DIS, and DAO messages are not modified during
          transportation;</t>

          <t>the received DIO, DIS, and DAO messages are not retransmissions
          of previous messages;</t>

          <t>the content of the DIO, DIS, and DAO messages may be made legible
          to only authorized entities.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In meeting the above objectives, RPL also needs to provide tunable
      mechanisms both to allow matching the security afforded to the
      application domain requirements and to enable efficient use of system
      resources, as discussed in <xref target="roll-sec-arch"></xref> and
      <xref target="roll-sec-mech"></xref>. In particular, consistent with the
      recommendations of <xref target="RFC4107"></xref>, RPL should specify
      the use of a symmetric-key based cryptographic algorithm as a baseline
      for session exchanges and rely on the use of appropriately developed and
      validated key management mechanisms for key control.</t>

      <t>The functions of the different RPL messages, and the next hops
      information placed in the Routing Header and RPL option TLV carried in
      the Hop-by-Hop Option Header are factors that can be taken into account
      when deciding the optional security features and levels of strength to
      be afforded. For example, the DIO messages build routes to roots while
      the DAO messages support the building of downward routes to leaf nodes.
      Consequently, there may be application environments in which the
      directions of the routes have different importance and thus warrant the
      use of different security features and/or strength. In other words, it
      may be desirable to have an RPL security design that extends the
      tunability of the security features and strengths to message types. The
      use of a per-message security specification will allow flexibility in
      permitting application-domain security choices as well as overall
      tunability.</t>
