1.  Introduction

   The IETF has been specifying and continues to specify Performance
   Metrics.  While IP Performance Metris (IPPM) is the working group
   (WG) primarily focusing on Peformance Metrics definition at the IETF,
   other working groups, have also specified Peformance Metrics.  The
   "Metric Blocks for use with RTCP's Extended Report Framework"
   [XRBLOCK] WG recently specified many Peformance Metrics related to
   "RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)" [RFC3611], which
   establishes a framework to allow new information to be conveyed in
   RTCP, supplementing the original report blocks defined in "RTP: A
   Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications", [RFC3550].  The
   Benchmarking Methodology" [BMWG] WG proposed some Peformance Metrics
   part of the benchmarking methodology.  The IP Flow Information eXport
   WG (IPFIX) [IPFIX] Information elements related to performance
   metrics are currently proposed.  The Performance Metrics for Other
   Layers (PMOL) [PMOL], a concluded working group, defined some
   Peformance Metrics related to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) voice
   quality [RFC6035].  It is expected that more and more Peformance
   Metrics will be defined in the future, not only IP based metrics, but
   also protocol-specific ones and application-specific ones.

   However, there is currently no Peformance Metrics registry in IANA.
   This creates a real problem for the industry: first to discover which
   performance metrics have already specified, second to avoid
   Peformance Metrics redefinition.  Only someone with a broad IETF
   knowledge would be able to find its way among all the different
   Peformance Metrics specified in the different WGs.

   The IPPM Metrics Registry (RFC4148) was an attempt to create such a
   Peformance Metrics registry.  However, that registry was reclassified

   as obsolete with [RFC6248], "RFC 4148 and the IP Performance Metrics
   (IPPM) Registry of Metrics Are Obsolete", and consequently withdrawn.

   A couple of interesting quotes from RFC 4148 might help understand
   the issues related to that registry.

   1.  "It is not believed to be feasible or even useful to register
       every possible combination of Type P, metric parameters, and
       Stream parameters using the current structure of the IPPM Metrics
       Registry."

   2.  "The registry structure has been found to be insufficiently
       detailed to uniquely identify IPPM metrics."

   3.  "Despite apparent efforts to find current or even future users,
       no one responded to the call for interest in the RFC 4148
       registry during the second half of 2010."

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   [RFC6390] defines:

   Performance Metric:  A Performance Metric is a quantitative measure
      of performance, specific to an IETF-specified protocol or specific
      to an application transported over an IETF-specified protocol.
      Examples of Performance Metrics are the FTP response time for a
      complete file download, the DNS response time to resolve the IP
      address, a database logging time, etc.

   Performance Metrics Directorate:  The Performance Metrics Directorate
      is a directorate that provides guidance for Performance Metrics
      development in the IETF.  The Performance Metrics Directorate
      should be composed of experts in the performance community,
      potentially selected from the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM),
      Benchmarking Methodology (BMWG), and Performance Metrics for Other
      Layers (PMOL) WGs.

2.  Guidelines for considering New Performance Metric Development

   "Guidelines for Considering New Performance Metric Development",
   [RFC6390] defines a framework and a process for developing
   Performance Metrics for protocols above and below the IP layer (such
   as IP-based applications that operate over reliable or datagram

   transport protocols).  These metrics can be used to characterize
   traffic on live networks and services.  As such, RFC 6390 does not
   define any Performance Metrics.

   RFC 6390 scope covers guidelines for the Performance Metrics
   Directorate members for considering new Performance Metrics and
   suggests how the Performance Metrics Directorate will interact with
   the rest of the IETF.

2.1.  Performance Metric Template Definition

   RFC 6390 imposes a template to be used for Peformance Metrics
   specification.

   Normative

   o  Metric Name

   o  Metric Description

   o  Method of Measurement or Calculation

   o  Units of Measurement

   o  Measurement Point(s) with potential Measurement Domain

   o  Measurement Timing

   Informative

   o  Implementation

   o  Verification

   o  Use and Applications

   o  Reporting Model

2.2.  Performance Metric Directorate

   The performance metrics directorate mission is mentioned at
   [performance-metrics-directorate]:

      The Performance Metrics Directorate assists the OPS Area Directors
      to review performance-related documents intended for IESG review.

      The Performance Metrics Directorate can also act as advisors to
      Working Groups in any area of the IETF: it provides guidance to

Internet-Draft            PERF-METRIC REGISTRY                 July 2013


      protocol development Working Groups when considering an Internet-
      Draft that specifies Performance Metrics for a protocol.  Such can
      be arranged between the WG chairs and the Directorate
      Administrator (or the responsible ADs).

      In forthcoming reviews, the Performance Metrics Directorate will
      be applying the Guidelines for Considering New Performance Metric
      Development, RFC 6390.

      The review will be sent to the Performance Metrics Directorate
      mailing list (pm-dir@ietf.org), to the draft authors, WG chairs,
      and respective AD.  The way to reach the authors, WG chairs, and
      respective AD is to send an email to "draft-
      name".all@tools.ietf.org.

   In practice, a weekly cron job discovers all the IETF drafts that
   refers to RFC 6390, or that contains the keyword "performance
   metric".  Once discovered, the different drafts are assigned a
   Peformance Metric Directorate reviewer.  One of the primary task is
   to ensure that the RFC 6390 template is correctly applied, making
   sure that the Peformance Metric semantic is correctly specified.

3.  Performance Metrics in the IPFIX Registry

   There are multiple proposals to add performance metrics Information
   Elements in the IPFIX IANA registry [iana-ipfix-assignments], to be
   used with the IPFIX protocol [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol-rfc5101bis].
   This is perfectly legal according the "Information Model for IPFIX"
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-information-model-rfc5102bis] and "Guidelines for
   Authors and Reviewers of IPFIX Information Elements"
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-ie-doctors].

   Simply adding some text in the Information Element Description field
   might be a solution if this description is compliant with the RFC6390
   template definition.  However, this is not a ideal solution.  On the
   top of having potentially long descriptions, this imposes a specific
   formatting for the description field of the performance metrics-
   related Information Elements, while none is imposed for the non
   performance metrics-related ones.

   The preferred approach is for the Peformance Metrics to be self-
   described in their own registry.  When the Peformance Metrics needs
   to be defined in the IPFIX IANA registry, the new Information Element
   can simply refer to the specific entry in the Peformance Metrics
   registry.

5.  Security Considerations

   This draft doesn't introduce any security considerations.  However,
   the definition of Peformance Metrics may introduce some security
   concerns, and should be reviewed with security in mind.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document refers to an initial set of Peformance Metrics.  The
   list of these Information Elements is given in the "Initial Set of
   Performance Metrics" Section.  The Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) has created a new registry for Peformance Metrics
   called "Performance Metrics", and filled it with the initial list in
   Section 4.

Internet-Draft            PERF-METRIC REGISTRY                 July 2013


   New assignments for Peformance Metric will be administered by IANA
   through Expert Review [RFC5226], i.e., review by one of a group of
   experts designated by an IETF Area Director.  The group of experts
   MUST check the requested Peformance Metric for completeness, accuracy
   of the template description, and for correct naming according to
   [RFC6390].  Requests for Performance Metric that duplicate the
   functionality of existing Performance Metris SHOULD be declined.

   The specification of new Performance Metrics MUST use the template
   specified in Section 5.4.4 of RFC 6390 and MUST be published using a
   well-established and persistent publication medium.  The experts will
   initially be drawn from the Working Group Chairs and document editors
   of the Peformance Metrics directorate
   [performance-metrics-directorate].
