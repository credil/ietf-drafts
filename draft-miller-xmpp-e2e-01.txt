Internet-Draft                  XMPP E2E                       June 2012


1.  Introduction

   End-to-end encryption of traffic sent over the Extensible Messaging
   and Presence Protocol [RFC6120] is a desirable goal.  Requirements
   and a threat analysis for XMPP encryption are provided in [E2E-REQ].
   Many possible approaches to meet those (or similar) requirements have
   been proposed over the years, including methods based on PGP, S/MIME,
   SIGMA, and TLS.

   Most proposals have not been able to support multiple end-points for
   a given recipient.  As more devices support XMPP, it becomes more
   desirable to allow an entity to communicate with another in a more
   secure manner, regardless of the number of agents th entity is
   employing.  This document specifies an approach for encrypting
   communications between two entities which each might have multiple
   end-points.


2.  Terminology

   This document inherits terminology defined in [RFC6120].

   Security-related terms are to be understood in the sense defined in
   [RFC4949].

   The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


3.  Determining Support

   If an agent supports end-to-end object encryption, it MUST advertiset
   that fact in its responses to [XEP-0030] information ("disco#info")
   requests by returning a feature of
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-e2e:2:encrypt".

   <iq xmlns='jabber:client'
       id='disco1'
       to='romeo@montegue.lit/garden'
       type='result'>
     <query xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#info'>
       <feature xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-e2e:2:encrypt'/>
     </query>
   </iq>

   To help facilitate discovery, an agent SHOULD also include [XEP-0115]

   information in any directed or broadcast presence updates.


4.  Encrypting XMPP Stanzas

   The process that a sending agent follows for securing stanzas is the
   same regardless of the form of stanza (i.e., <iq/>, <message/>, or
   <presence/>).

4.1.  Prerequisites

   First, the sending agent prepares and retains the following:

   o  The JID of the sender (i.e. its own JID).  This SHOULD be the bare
      JID (localpart@domainpart).

   o  The JID of the recipient.  This SHOULD be the bare JID
      (localpart@domainpart).

   o  A Content Master Key (CMK).  The CMK MUST have a length at least
      equal to that of the required encryption keys and MUST be
      generated randomly.  See [RFC4086] for considerations on
      generating random values.

   o  A CMK identifier (CID).  The CID MUST be unique for a given
      (sender, recipient, CMK) tuple, and MUST NOT be derived from CMK
      itself.

   o  Ensures the plaintext stanza is fully qualified, including the
      proper namespace declarations (e.g. contains the attribute 'xmlns'
      set to the value "jabber:client" for 'jabber:client' stanzas
      defined in [RFC6120]).


4.2.  Process

   For a given plaintext stanza (S), the sending agent performs the
   following:

   1.  Notes the current UTC date and time N when this stanza is
       constructed, formatted as described under Section 7.

   2.  Constructs a forwarding envelope M using a <forwarded/> element
       qualified by the "urn:xmpp:forward:0" namespace (as defined in
       [XEP-0297]) as follows:

Internet-Draft                  XMPP E2E                       June 2012


       *  The child element <delay/> qualified by the "urn:xmpp:delay"
          namespace (as defined in [XEP-0203]) with the attribute
          'stamp' set to the UTC date and time value N

       *  The plaintext stanza S

   3.  Convert the forwarding envelope M to a UTF-8 encoded string (M'),
       optionallly removing line breaks and other insignificant
       whitespace between elements and attributes, i.e.  P' = UTF8-
       encode(P).  We call P' a "stanza-string" because for purposes of
       encryption and decryption it is treated not as XML but as an
       opaque string (this avoids the need for complex canonicalization
       of the XML input).

   4.  Generates any additional unprotected block cipher factors (IV);
       e.g. initialization vector/nonce.  A sending agent MUST ensure
       that no two sets of factors are used with the same CMK, and
       SHOULD NOT reuse such factors for other stanzas.

   5.  Performs the message encryption steps from [JOSE-JWE] to generate
       the JWE Header H, JWE Ciphertext C, and JWE Integrity Value I;
       using the following inputs:

       *  The 'alg' property is set to "none"; recipients use 'keyreq'
          in Section 6 to obtain the CMK.

       *  The 'enc' property is set to the intended content encryption
          algorithm.

       *  CMK as the Content Master Key.

       *  M' as the plaintext content to encrypt.

   6.  Constructs an <e2e/> element qualified by the
       "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-e2e:2" namespace as follows:

       *  The attribute 'id' set to the identifier value CID.

       *  The child element <header/> qualified by the
          "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-e2e:2" namespace and with XML
          character data as H, encoded base64url as per [RFC4684].

       *  The child element <data/> qualified by the
          "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-e2e:2" namespace and with XML
          character data as C, encoded base64url as per [RFC4684].

       *  The child element <mac/> qualified by the "urn"ietf:params:
          xml:ns:xmpp-e2e:2" namespace and with XML character data as I,
          encoded base64url as per [RFC4684].

   7.  Sends the <e2e/> element as the payload of a stanza that SHOULD
       match the stanza from step 1 in kind (e.g., <message/>), type
       (e.g., "chat"), and addressing (e.g. to="romeo@montague.net"
       from="juliet@capulet.net/balcony").  If the original stanza (S)
       has a value for the "id" attribute, this stanza MUST NOT use the
       same value for its "id" attribute.


4.3.  Example - Securing a Message

   NOTE: unless otherwise indicated, all line breaks are included for
   readability.

   The sending agent begins with the plaintext version of the <message/>
   stanza 'S':

   <message xmlns='jabber:client'
            from='juliet@capulet.lit/balcony'
            to='romeo@montegue.lit/garden'
            type='chat'>
     <thread>35740be5-b5a4-4c4e-962a-a03b14ed92f4</thread>
     <body>
       But to be frank, and give it thee again.
       And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
       My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
       My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
       The more I have, for both are infinite.
     </body>
   </message>

   and the following prerequisites:
   o  Sender JID as "juliet@capulet.lit"

   o  Recipient JID as "romeo@montegue.lit"

   o  Content master key 'CMK' as (base64 encoded)
      "-ElMo6FndEkMxWP3TIkp1dDfVKqmqAAgrlcvVnUVpOc="

   o  CMK identifier CID as "835c92a8-94cd-4e96-b3f3-b2e75a438f92"


   The sending agent performs steps 1 and 2 to generate the envelope:

         The more I have, for both are infinite.
       </body>
     </message>
   </forwarded>

   Then the sending agent performs steps 3, 4, and 5 to generate the
   [JOSE-JWE] outputs:

   JWE Header

   {
     "alg":"none",
     "enc":"A256CCM",
     "iv":"B7waCj2vF_sLaJfe-1GHrA=="
   }

   NOTE: For CCM, the integrity value is encoded as part of the
   ciphertext, therefore the resulting Integrity Value is an octet
   string of length 0.

   Then the sending agent performs steps 6 and 7, and sends the

5.  Decrypting XMPP Stanzas

5.1.  Protocol Not Understood

   If the receiving agent does not understand the protocol, it MUST do
   one and only one of the following: (1) ignore the <e2e/> extension,
   (2) ignore the entire stanza, or (3) return a <service-unavailable/>
   error to the sender, as described in [RFC6120].

   NOTE: If the inbound stanza is an <iq/>, the receiving agent MUST
   return an error to the sending agent, to comply with the exchanging
   of IQ stanzas in [RFC6121].

Internet-Draft                  XMPP E2E                       June 2012


5.2.  Process

   Upon receipt of an encrypted stanza, the receiving agent performs the
   following:
   1.  Determines if a valid CMK is available, associated with the CID
       specified by the 'id' attribute value of the <e2e/&gtl; element
       and the sending agent JID specified by the 'from' attribute of
       the wrapping stanza.  If the receiving agent does not already
       have the CMK, it requests it according to Section 6.

   2.  Performs the message decryption steps from [JOSE-JWE] to generate
       the plaintext forwarding envelope string M', using the following
       inputs:

       *  The JWE Header H from the <header/> element's character data
          content.

       *  The JWE Ciphertext C from the <data/> element's character data
          content.

       *  The JWE Integrity Value I from the <mac/> element's character
          data content.

   3.  Converts the forwarding envelope UTF-8 ecoded string M' into XML
       element M.

   4.  Obtains the UTC date and time N from the <delay/> child element,
       and verifies it is within the accepted range, as specified in
       Section 7.

   5.  Obtains the plaintext stanza S, which is a child element node of
       M; the stanza MUST be fully qualified with proper namespace
       declarations for XMPP stanzas, to help distinguish it from other
       content within M.

       .

5.3.  Insufficient Information

   At step 1, if the receiving agent is unable to obtain the CMK, or the
   receiving agent could not otherwise determine the additional
   information, it MAY return a <bad-request/> error to the sending
   agent (as described in [RFC6120]), optionally supplemented by an
   application-specific error condition element of <insufficient-
   information/>:

   In addition to returning an error, the receiving agent SHOULD NOT

   and SHOULD provide some explicit alternate processing of the stanza
   (which MAY be to display a message informing the recipient that it
   has received a stanza that cannot be decrypted).

5.4.  Failed Decryption

   At step 2, if the receiving agent is unable to successfully decrypt
   the stanza, the receiving agent SHOULD return a <bad-request/> error

   and SHOULD provide some explicit alternate processing of the stanza
   (which MAY be to display a message informing the recipient that it
   has received a stanza that cannot be decrypted).

5.5.  Timestamp Not Acceptable

   At step 4, if the stanza is successfully decrypted but the timestamp
   fails the checks outlined in Section 7, the receiving agent MAY
   return a <not-acceptable/> error to the sender (as described in
   [RFC6120]), optionally supplemented by an application-specific error
   condition element of <bad-timestamp/> (previously defined in
   [RFC3923]):

     </error>
   </message>

5.6.  Successful Decryption

   If the receiving agent successfully decrypted the payload, it MUST
   NOT return a stanza error.

   If the payload is an <iq/> of type "get" or "set", and the response
   to this <iq/> is of type "error", the receiving agent MUST send the
   encrypted response wrapped in an <iq/> of type "result", to prevent
   exposing information about the payload.


6.  Requesting Content Keys

   Because of the dynamic nature of XMPP stanza routing, the protocol
   does not exchange content keys as part of the encrypted stanza.
   Instead, a separate content key protocol is used by receiving agents
   to request a particular content key from the sending agent.

6.1.  Request Process

   Before a CMK can be requested, the receiving agent MUST have at least
   one public key for which it also has the private key.

   To request a CMK, the receiving agent performs the following:

   1.  Constructs a [JOSE-JWK] JWK Set (KS), containing information
       about each public key the requesting agent wishes to use.  Each
       key SHOULD include a value for the property 'kid' which uniquely
       identifies it within the context of all provided keys.  Each key
       MUST include a value for the property 'kid' if any two keys use
       the same algorithm.

   2.  Constructs a <keyreq/> element qualified by the
       "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-e2e:2" namespace as follows:

       *  The attribute 'id' set to the CMK identifier value CID.

       *  The child element <pkey/> qualified by the
          "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-e2e:2" namespace and with XML
          character data as KS, encoded base64url as pre [RFC4684].

   3.  Sends the <keyreq/> element as the payload of an <iq/> stanza
       with the attribute 'type' set to "get", the attribute 'to' set to
       the full JID of the original encrypted stanza's sender, and the
       attribute 'id' set to an opaque string value the receiving agent
       uses to track the <iq/> response.


6.2.  Accept Process

   If the sending agent approves the request, it performs the following:

   1.  Chooses a key (PK) from the keys provided via KS, and notes its
       identifier value 'kid'.

   2.  Constructs a parial [JOSE-JWE] header (H) as follows:

       *  The property 'alg' set to the cryptographic algorithm for PK,
          which is used to secure the content master key CMK.

       *  The property 'kid' set to the identifier matching PK.

       NOTE: this header is intentionally lacking required attributes.
       The receiving agent is responsible for assembling a final, valid
       JWE header.

   3.  Encrypts the content master key CMK using the key PK, i.e.  CMK'
       = pki-encrypt(PK, CMK).

   4.  Constructs a <keyreq/> element qualified by the
       "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-e2e:2" namespace as follows:

       *  The attribute 'id' set to the CMK identifier CID.

       *  The child element <header/> qualified by the
          "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-e2e:2" namespace and with XML
          character data as H, encoded base64url as per [RFC4684].

       *  The child element <cmk/> qualified by the
          "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-e2e:2" namespace and with XML
          character data as CMK', encoded base64url as per [RFC4684].

   5.  Sends the <keyreq/> element as the payload of an <iq/> stanza
       with the attribute 'type' set to "result", the attribute 'to' set
       to the full JID from the request <iq/>'s 'from' attribute, and
       the attribute 'id' set to the value of the request <iq/>'s 'id'
       attribute.


6.3.  Error Conditions

   If the sending agent does not approve of the request, it sends an
   <iq/> stanza of type "error" and containing the reason for denying
   the request:

   o  <forbidden/>: the key request is made by an entity that is not
      authorized to decrypt stanzas from the sending agent and/or for
      the indicated CID.

   o  <item-not-found/>: the requested CID is no longer valid.

   o  <not-acceptable/>: the key request did not contain any keys the
      sending agent understands.


6.4.  Example of Successful Key Request

   NOTE: unless otherwise indicated, all line breaks are included for
   readability.

   To begin a key request, the receiving agent performs step 1 from
   request process (Section 6.1) to generate the [JOSE-JWK]:

7.  Inclusion and Checking of Timestamps

   Timestamps are included to help prevent replay attacks.  All
   timestamps MUST conform to [XEP-0082] and be presented as UTC with no
   offset, and SHOULD include the seconds and fractions of a second to
   three digits.  Absent a local adjustment to the sending agent's

   perceived time or the underlying clock time, the sending agent MUST
   ensure that the timestamps it sends to the receiver increase
   monotonically (if necessary by incrementing the seconds fraction in
   the timestamp if the clock returns the same time for multiple
   requests).  The following rules apply to the receiving agent:

   o  It MUST verify that the timestamp received is within five minutes
      of the current time, except as described below for offline
      messages.

   o  It SHOULD verify that the timestamp received is greater than any
      timestamp received in the last 10 minutes which passed the
      previous check.

   o  If any of the foregoing checks fails, the timestamp SHOULD be
      presented to the receiving entity (human or application) marked as
      "old timestamp", "future timestamp", or "decreasing timestamp",
      and the receiving entity MAY return a stanza error to the sender.

   The foregoing timestamp checks assume that the recipient is online
   when the message is received.  However, if the recipient is offline
   then the server might store the message for delivery when the
   recipient is next online (offline storage does not apply to <iq/> or
   <presence/> stanzas, only <message/> stanzas).  As described in
   [XEP-0160], when sending an offline message to the recipient, the
   server SHOULD include delayed delivery data as specified in
   [XEP-0203] so that the recipient knows that this is an offline
   message and also knows the original time of receipt at the server.
   In this case, the recipient SHOULD verify that the timestamp received
   in the encrypted message is within five minutes of the time stamped
   by the recipient's server in the <delay/> element.


8.  Interaction with Stanza Semantics

   The following limitations and caveats apply:

   o  Undirected <presence/> stanzas SHOULD NOT be encrypted.  Such
      stanzas are delivered to anyone the sender has authorized, and can
      generate a large volume of key requests.

   o  Stanzas directed to multiplexing services (e.g. multi-user chat)
      SHOULD NOT be encrypted, unless the sender has established an
      acceptable trust relationship with the multiplexing service.

9.  Mandatory-to-Implement Cryptographic Algorithms

   All algorithms that MUST be implemented for [JOSE-JWE] also MUST be
   implemented for this specification.


10.  Security Considerations

10.1.  Storage of Encrypted Stanzas

   The recipient's server might store any <message/> stanzas received
   until the recipient is next available; this duration could be
   anywhere from a few minutes to several months.

10.2.  Re-use of Content Master Keys

   A sender SHOULD NOT use the same CMK for stanzas intended for
   different recipients, as determined by the localpart and domainpart
   of the recipient's JID.

   A sender MAY re-use a CMK for several stanzas to the same recpient.
   In this case, the CID remains the same, but the sending agent MUST
   generate a new IV for each encrypted stanza.  The sender SHOULD
   periodically generate a new CMK; however, this specification does not
   mandate any specific algorithms or processes.

   In the case of <message/> stanzas, a sending agent might generate a
   new CMK each time it generates a new ThreadID, as outlined in
   [XEP-0201].


11.  IANA Considerations

11.1.  XML Namespace Name for e2e Data in XMPP

   A URN sub-namespace of encrypted content for the Extensible Messaging
   and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is defined as follows.

   URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-e2e:2
   Specification:  RFC XXXX
   Description:  This is an XML namespace name of encrypted content for
      the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol as defined by RFC
      XXXX.
