Abstract

   This document proposes an enhanced EVPN mechanism, segment-based EVPN
   (S-EVPN).  It satisfies the requirements of PBB-EVPN but does not
   require PBB implementation on PE.  The solution uses a global label
   for each Ethernet Segment (ES) in an EVPN.  It inserts the source ES
   label into packets at ingress PE and learns C-MAC and source ES label
   binding at egress PE.  The solution makes the implementation easier
   and closer to EVPN's compared to PBB-EVPN but has the PBB-EVPN
   benefits.

1.  Introduction

   E-VPN [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn] introduces a solution for multipoint
   L2VPN services.  It has multi-homing capability and uses BGP for
   distributing customer/client MAC address reachability information
   over the core MPLS/IP network.  PBB-EVPN [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-pbb-evpn]
   integrates PBB and E-VPN to achieves these:

   1. reduce the number of MAC advertisement routes in BGP;

   2. provide client MAC address mobility;

   3. confine the scope of C-MAC learning to only active flows;

   4. offer per site policies and avoid C-MAC address flushing on
   topology changes.

   This document discusses the challenges faced by PBB-EVPN in the
   implementation and operation.  It proposes an enhanced E-VPN
   mechanism, i.e. segment-based EVPN (S-EVPN), that provides the same
   benefits as of PBB-EVPN but does not require implementing PBB
   function on PE.  S-EVPN mechanism allocates a global label for each
   Ethernet Segments in E-VPN, inserts the source ES label into the
   packet at ingress PE, and learns C-MAC and source ES label binding at
   egress PE.  As a result it is not necessary to determine the source
   of C-MAC according to the B-MAC encapsulation which is required in
   PBB-EVPN.  S-EVPN has simpler operation and management of EVPN and
   better encapsulation efficiency of packets compared to PBB-EVPN.  In
   addition, it is easy to enhance the E-VPN to support S-EVPN and
   S-EVPN can unify the unicast traffic forwarding no matter C-MACs are
   learned by control plane or data plane.

3.  Challenges of PBB-EVPN Implementation

   PBB-EVPN has advantages in the following aspects as
   [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-pbb-evpn]:

   -- MAC Advertisement Route Scalability

   -- C-MAC Mobility with MAC Sub-netting

   -- C-MAC Address Learning and Confinement

   -- Seamless Interworking with TRILL and 802.1aq Access Networks

   -- Per Site Policy Support

   -- Avoiding C-MAC Address Flushing

   However, there are some challenges to implement PBB-EVPN.

   1.  Creation and Management B-MAC

   For PBB-EVPN, the choice of B-MAC address(es) for the PE nodes must
   be examined carefully as it has implications on the proper operation
   of multi-homing.  These addresses are usually locally administered by
   the Service Provider which involves a lot of operation and management
   such as design, configuration and checking.  Automating B-MAC Address
   Assignment can be applied, but for some scenarios the method cannot
   work and manual provision is inevitable.  A more general automated
   solution can be proposed to reduce manual intervention.

   2.  Encapsulation Efficiency of PBB-EVPN

   When PBB encapsulation (shown in the figure 1) is adopted in PBB-
   EVPN, the B-DA, I-Tag, etc. fields in the encapsulation are useless
   in PBB-EVPN which reduce the effective payload.

                  Figure 1: PBB Encapsulation


   In the PBB encapsulation for PBB-EVPN, the source B-MAC is necessary
   since the egress PE need to learn the correspondence between C-MACs



Li, et al.              Expires January 07, 2014                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             Segment-Based EVPN                  July 2013


   and B-MACs.  The destination B-MAC is not necessary since the
   destination (egress PE) is reachable through the tunnel setup in
   advance instead of searching routes according to the destination
   B-MAC.

   The I-SID is also not necessary any more.  PBB divides the Ethernet
   network into two layers: I-Component and B-Component.  In the egress
   PE, B-Component need identify I-Component through I-SID.  For PBB-
   VPLS, MAC learning is through the data plane which is always to use
   broadcast or multicast for unknown unicast traffic.  In order to
   indentify different forwarding instance, I-SID must be adopted.  For
   PBB-EVPN, the forwarding instance is constructed through the control
   plane.  That is, the forwarding instance is constructed through the
   RT matching of EVIs and identified by the label advertised.  So I-SID
   information in PBB encapsulation for PBB-EVPN is no use any more.

   In addition B-VID in PBB encapsulation is almost never used.  In a
   summary, in the PBB encapsulation for PBB-EVPN, only source B-MAC is
   indispensable.  The encapsulation efficiency can be optimized.

   3.  Combination of PBB and E-VPN

   The issues are dealt with by PBB-EVPN through the combination of two
   distinct technologies: PBB (layer 2 technology) and MPLS technology.
   In order to reduce the number of BGP MAC advertisement routes in
   E-VPN, PBB-EVPN can aggregate Customer/Client MAC (C- MAC) addresses
   via Provider Backbone MAC address (B-MAC).  In fact, C-MAC addresses
   can be aggregated via MPLS label.  Thus the issue solved by PBB-VPN
   can be solved in the method that is based on only MPLS technology.
   That is, the method is similar as E-VPN which is only based on MPLS
   technology.  In other word, we can enhance E-VPN according to the
   similar way to gain PBB-EVPN benefits but not implement PBB on PE,
   which is a clean and simpler solution than PBB-EVPN.

4.  Architecture of S-EVPN

   To implement C-MAC summarization scheme, Segment-based EVPN (S-EVPN)
   introduces a global label for each Ethernet Segment in an EVPN
   regardless single homed or multi-homed CE.  BGP needs to advertise
   the global label and Ethernet Segment binding to all PEs.  In data
   plane, ingress PE inserts the source ES label into packets; egress PE
   learns the C-MAC and source ES label binding upon receiving packets.
   S-EVPN purely relies on BGP IP/MPLS technology.

   The encapsulation of S-EVPN is shown in figure 2.  The outmost label
   is the label for MPLS tunnel.  The second label is the label which is
   allocated for Ethernet A-D route per EVI as E-VPN
   [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn] and can identify a given <ESI, Ethernet Tag ID>

   tuple per EVI or per <ESI, EVI> (where the Ethernet Tag ID is set to
   0).  The third label is a global label which identify an Ethernet
   Segment uniquely.  The global label allocated for a specific Ethernet
   Segment will be described in section 4.2.

   +--------------+---------------+------------------------+---------------+
   | Tunnel Label |   EVI Label   | Source ES Global Label |    Payload    |
   +--------------+---------------+------------------------+---------------+
                Figure 2: S-EVPN Encapsulation



4.1.  C-MAC Learning

   In S-EVPN, C-MACs can be learned in the data plane to determine which
   source Ethernet Segment they are from and which EVI they belongs to.
   The forwarding entry to these learned C-MACs can be installed
   according to the source ES and EVI information.

   In S-EVPN, Ingress PE needs to send unknown traffic with source
   C-MACs to all remote PEs according to the encapsulation as shown in
   figure 2.  When a specific egress PE receives the packet:

   1. it can learn the C-MAC and possible VLAN Tag in the payload;

   2. it can learns the EVI the C-MAC belongs to according to the EVI
   label which is allocated by the egress PE;

   3. it can learns the Source Ethernet Segment the CMAC belongs to
   according to the advertised the global label and Ethernet Segment
   binding in BGP.

   Then the egress PE needs to install the forwarding entry to the
   learned C-MAC.  The forwarding entry to the C-MAC need two types of
   information: the reachability information to the ingress PE which the
   C-MAC belongs to; the identification for the Ethernet Segment of the
   EVI on the ingress PE through which the packet can send to the C-MAC.

   1.  Tunnel to the ingress PE: Egress PE determines PE which the
   Source Ethernet Segment belongs according to the advertised the
   global label and Ethernet Segment binding in BGP.  Then egress PE can
   determine the tunnel to the ingress PE.

   2.  Label for the Ethernet Segment of the EVI on the ingress PE: The
   ingress PE needs to allocate label for the <ESI, EVI, Ethernet Tag
   ID> tuple per EVI or per <ESI, EVI> and advertise the corresponding
   Ethernet A-D Route per EVI to remote PEs.  The egress PE can
   determines the Source Ethernet Segment, the EVI and the possible VLAN

   which the learned the C-MAC belongs to.  Then it can determine the
   label binded to the <ESI, EVI, Ethernet Tag ID> tuple per EVI or per
   <ESI, EVI> which is advertised though the Ethernet A-D Route per EVI
   by the ingress PE.

   Besides the two types of forwarding information, when the egress PE
   sends a specific packet to the learned C-MAC, it needs to determine
   the Ethernet Segment from which the packet come and encapsulate the
   global label for the Ethernet Segment firstly in the packet.

   According to above procedures in S-EVPN, the egress PE can learn
   C-MACs and install forwarding entries to these C-MACs.

4.2.  ES Global Label Assignment

   In S-EVPN, C-MAC summarization is done per an Ethernet Segment.  The
   global ES label is introduced to identify the Ethernet Segment.  The
   advantages of using global label are:

   1. identify the ES globally;

   2. leverage existing MPLS label stack implementation;

   3. the label can be allocated dynamically to automate provision.

   In order to allocate a global label for an Ethernet Segment, there
   should be a centralized control point.  Route Reflector (RR) of BGP
   may serve this role and we call this type of RR as RR+. The S-EVPN
   network is shown in the figure 3.  All PEs of S-EVPN connects with
   RR+. The procedure is as follows:

Internet-Draft             Segment-Based EVPN                  July 2013


   1.  Auto-Discovery of Ethernet Segment

   RR+ can learn Ethernet Segment through the Ethernet A-D route per
   Ethernet Segment defined by [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn].  Note that, in
   S-EVPN, every ES must has a unique identifier including the single-
   homed CEs.  That is, ESI 0 cannot denote for a single-homed CE in
   S-EVPN.  The ESI for the single-homed CE must be unique network wide
   and can be created automatically.  The ESI is encoded as a ten octets
   integer.  One way to generate ESI value for a single-homed CE is to
   use the MAC address of the Ethernet Segment with the low order 4
   octets filled by value 0.  The ESI value generation for multi-homed
   CE is specified in EVPN and can be reused in S-EVPN.  Through
   Ethernet A-D route per Ethernet Segment, RR+ can learn all Ethernet
   Segments on all PEs.

   2.  ES Global Label Allocation

   RR+ allocates global labels for the Ethernet Segments discovered and
   advertises <ES, label> pair to all PEs.  The PEs that are members of
   E-VPN keep track of the global label/Ethernet Segment mappings.

   The PE nodes perform the following functions:

   - Learn customer/client MAC addresses (C-MACs) over the attachment
   circuits in the data- plane, per normal bridge operation.

   - Learn remote C-MAC to B-MAC bindings in the data-plane from traffic
   ingress from the core per [802.1ah] bridging operation.

   - Advertise local B-MAC address reach-ability information in BGP to
   all other PE nodes in the same set of service instances.  Note that
   every PE has a set of local B-MAC addresses that uniquely identify
   the device.  More on the PE addressing in section 5.

   - Build a forwarding table from remote BGP advertisements received
   associating remote B-MAC addresses with remote PE IP addresses and
   the associated MPLS label(s).

4.3.  Ethernet A-D Route Per EVI

   The procedures defined for Ethernet A-D router per EVI in
   [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn] will be reused by S-EVPN.  In S-EVPN, both
   single home CE and multi-home CE have a unique ES identification.  So
   for both single-homed CEs and multi-homed CEs, PEs needs to allocate
   MPLS label for the <ESI, EVI, Ethernet Tag ID> tuple per EVI or per
   <ESI, EVI> and advertise corresponding Ethernet A-D routes per EVI.
   The MPLS label is used to identify a specific ES in an EVI.

Internet-Draft             Segment-Based EVPN                  July 2013


4.4.  Ethernet A-D Route Per ES

   In S-EVPN, support of Ethernet A-D Route per Ethernet Segment is
   still MANDATORY.  PEs can learn Ethernet Segments through this type
   of route as E-VPN.  In S-EVPN, RR+ which all PEs connect to can also
   learn Ethernet Segments.  When constructing the Ethernet A-D Route
   per Ethernet Segment, there are following differences from E-VPN:

   -- The ESI for the single-homed CE in this route must be unique
   network wide instead of 0.

   -- The "ESI Label Extended Community" MUST be included in the route
   and the "Active-Standby" bit in the flags MUST be set accordingly.
   But the MPLS label in the extended community can be set as 0 (Invalid
   MPLS label value) since ES global label is introduced in S-EVPN which
   can substitute ESI label.

5.  Improvement on EVPN

   When S-EVPN process is introduced, the E-VPN process defined by
   [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn] can also be improved.  The improvement includes
   split horizon, unifying unicast and multicast forwarding.

5.1.  Split Horizon

   ES global label is introduced to identify the Ethernet Segment
   globally.  Thus S-EVPN can fulfill requirements proposed PBB-EVPN.
   Besides this, the ES global label can also be used for split horizon
   in EVPN.  In order to achieve split horizon function, E-VPN adopts
   ESI label to encapsulate it in every BUM packet originating from a
   non-DF PE to identify the Ethernet Segment of origin.  ES global
   label can use for the same purpose since it can identify the Ethernet
   Segment.  Every BUM packet originating from a non-DF PE is
   encapsulated as the encapsulation which is shown in the figure 2.
   Since the original ESI label in E-VPN can be substituted by the ES
   global label, the ESI label in the ESI Label Extended Community can
   be an invalid label value.  For the reason of compatibility, the ESI
   Label Extended Community can carry a valid ESI label.  Both ESI label
   and ES global label should be used for split horizon no matter which
   label is encapsulated in the packet.

   ES global label can also solve the possible issue for split horizon
   when MP2MP LSP is used to transport BUM traffic.  When P2MP LSPs is
   used, the upstream label assignment mechanism is introduced for split
   horizon.  When PE received the packet, it decapsulates the top MPLS
   label and forwards the packet using the context label space
   determined by the top label.  If the next label is the ESI label
   allocated by the ingress PE for a specific Ethernet Segment, the

   received PE will not forward the packet on the corresponding ES.  In
   the MP2MP LSP scenarios, there are multiple roots and the upstream
   label allocated for Ethernet Segment maybe the same.  So the received
   PE cannot determine a correct context label space according the top
   label for the MP2MP LSP.  That is, the upstream label assignment
   mechanism for split horizon introduced in the P2MP LSP scenario can
   not be reused in the MP2MP LSP.  But if the ES global label is used,
   in the MP2MP LSP scenario the received PE can also determine not to
   forward the packet on the specific ES which is identified by the ES
   global label.  In one word, no matter ingress replication, P2MP LSP,
   or MP2MP, S-EVPN provides a unified solution based on the ES global
   label.  It can reduce the complexity of the split horizon mechanism
   in E-VPN.

5.2.  Unifying MPLS Forwarding

   S-EVPN adopts MPLS forwarding for C-MAC learning.  In the control
   plane, it is just to add one new route type for E-VPN.  It is a
   smooth upgrading of E-VPN and can switch easily between C-MAC
   learning through control plane and C-MAC learning through data plane.

   When C-MACs is learned through the control plane, the unicast
   forwarding uses the label for the MAC route which is shown as
   follows:

       +--------------+-----------+---------------+
       | Tunnel Label | MAC Label |    Payload    |
       +--------------+-----------+---------------+
     Figure 4: E-VPN Unicast Forwarding Encapsulation


   When C-MACs is learned through the data plane, the unicast forwarding
   uses the EVI label and the Segment global label which is shown in
   figure 2.  In fact even if the C-MAC is learned through the data
   plane, the data plane can also use following encapsulation.  In this
   case, the label in MAC advertisement route should not be used.  From
   the comparison, we can see that when E-VPN and S-EVPN are introduced,
   the forwarding encapsulation can be unified no matter which way
   C-MACs are learned by.

   | Tunnel Label |   EVI Label   | Source ES Global Label |    Payload    |

6.1.  ES Global Label Request Extended Community

   ES Global Label Request Extended Community may be advertised along
   Ethernet A-D route per Ethernet Segment.  ES Global Label Request
   Extended Community can reuse ESI Label Extended Community defined in
   [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn] which is shown in the following figure:

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   There defines a new bit of the flag octet as the "Global Label
   Request" bit.

                Bit1: "Root-Leaf" bit
                Bit2: "Global Label Request" bit


   The third low order bit of the flags octet is defined as the "Global
   Label Request".  A value of 0 means there is no global label request
   for the Ethernet A-D route.  A value of 1 means that global label
   request is associated with the Ethernet A-D route.

6.2.  ES Global Label Mapping Route

   A new route type is defined for E-VPN NLRI to allocate global label
   for Ethernet Segment:

   +5 - ES Global Label Mapping Route

   An ES Global Label Mapping route type specific E-VPN NLRI consists of
   the following:

                 +---------------------------------------+
                 |      RD   (8 octets)                  |

                 |Ethernet Segment Identifier (10 octets)|

                 |  Ethernet Tag ID (4 octets)           |

7.  Operations

7.1.  ES Global Label Request

   Global label request is only for the Ethernet A-D route per Ethernet
   Segment.  The Ethernet A-D route per Ethernet Segment is constructed
   as defined by [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-evpn].  The Ethernet Segment Identifier
   MUST be a unique ten octet entity.  Even if the CE is single-homed,
   the corresponding Ethernet Segment Identifier MUST NOT be the
   reserved value 0.

   When request a global label for a specific Ethernet Segment, ES
   Global Label Request Extended Community MUST be used for the Ethernet
   A-D route.  ES Global Label Request Extended Community of S-EVPN can
   reuse the ESI Label Extended Community.  The "Global Label Request"
   bit of the flag octet MUST be set as 1 for Global Label Request.
   According to Section 5 "Improvement on E-VPN", if ES global label is
   introduced, the original ESI label may not be used.  The "root-leaf"
   bit of the flag octet and the ESI Label value in the ESI Label
   Extended Community can always be 0 to simplify the process.

   One or more Route Target(RT) MUST be carried with the Ethernet A-D
   route.  These RTs are the set of RTs associated with all the EVIs to
   which the Ethernet Segment belongs.  Since the Global label is
   allocated per Ethernet Segment, RTs carried by the Ethernet A-D route
   will be ignored by the RR+ when allocate global label for the
   Ethernet Segment specified in the Ethernet A-D routes.  The global
   label per Ethernet Segment is advertised to all PEs.  For multi-homed
   Ethernet Segment, if one EVI on one PE requests label allocation for
   the Ethernet Segment and the ES Global Label Mapping Route has been
   advertised corresponding to the Ethernet Segment, other EVIs on other
   PEs SHOULD NOT send the global label request for the Ethernet Segment
   again, that is, the "Global Label Request" bit SHOULD set as 0 when
   advertise Ethernet A-D routes for the Ethernet Segment by these EVIs.

7.2.  ES Global Label Allocation

Internet-Draft             Segment-Based EVPN                  July 2013


   When RR+ receives the Ethernet A-D route per Ethernet Segment and the
   "Global Label Request" bit of the ES Global Label Request Extended
   Community is set as 1, RR+ MUST allocate global label for the
   Ethernet Segment and advertise the ES Global Mapping route to all
   PEs.

   The ES Global Label Mapping route is constructed as follows:

   RD, Ethernet Segment Identifier and Ethernet Tag ID values can be
   directly derived from the corresponding Ethernet A-D route per
   Ethernet Segment.

   The MPLS Global Label field carries one or more labels (that
   corresponds to the stack of labels [MPLS-ENCAPS]).  Each label is
   encoded as 3 octets, where the high-order 20 bits contain the label
   value, and the low order bit contains "Bottom of Stack" (as defined
   in [MPLS- ENCAPS]).

   One or more Route Target(RT) MUST be carried with the ES Global Label
   Mapping route.  These RTs can be directly derived from the RTs
   associated with the corresponding Ethernet A-D route.

   For multi-homed Ethernet Segment, there maybe multiple global label
   request for the same Ethernet Segment advertised to RR+ by different
   PEs.  When RR+ receives them, if RTs for these routes are same, owing
   to the Ethernet Segment Identifier is the same, it SHOULD advertise
   only one corresponding ES Global Label Mapping Route to all PEs.
   That is, the subsequent global label request for the same Ethernet
   Segment SHOULD be ignored.  If RTs carried with the Ethernet A-D
   routes for the Ethernet Segment are different, RR+ SHOULD advertise
   multiple ES Global Label Mapping Routes with the same global label
   value and different RTs.
