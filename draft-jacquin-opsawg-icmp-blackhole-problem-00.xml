ICMP is a key protocol to exchange control and error messages over the Internet.
Unfortunately it is frequent that some routers along a given path do not correctly
process this protocol.
This document provides a taxonomy of the problem in order to help an end user who
suspects ICMP-related problems to better understand the situation, and possibly
identify the faulty router(s).

<section title="Introduction">
<!-- ==================================== -->

<t>ICMP is the key protocol to exchange control and error messages over the Internet.
ICMP is also implied in several functionalities, like the "Path Maximum Transmission Unit
Discovery" (PMTUD) mechanism <xref target="RFC1191"/>.
For instance, in IPv4, the sender sets the "donâ€™t fragment bit" (this is useless in
IPv6 since fragmentation is not authorized).
If a router cannot transmit the packet because of its size, it must send back to the
source an ICMP "Too Big" (type 3, code 4 with IPv4 and type 2, code 0 with IPv6) packet.
Iteratively, the source will lower the packet size until it matches the lowest MTU on
the path.
</t>

<t>
An appropriate ICMP's processing throughout a path is therefore a key requirement
both for troubleshooting operations (e.g., debugging routing problems) and for several
functionalities (e.g., PMTUD).
Unfortunately certain routers of the Internet do not handle ICMP as one would expect.
For instance, some of them will not forward ICMP packets on a given path, while others
will not generate and send ICMP packets in response to errors or solicitations (e.g.,
an ICMP "echo request").
Note that the presence of ICMP black holes has been the motivation for the design of
ICMP-free alternatives to PMTUD, namely the Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery (PLPMTUD)
<xref target="RFC4821"/>.
In the present document we take the opposite approach and try to improve ICMP-related
problem debugging in the Internet.
</t>

<t>The present document is essentially a problem position document.
More precisely, the contributions are twofold:

<section title="Path definitions">
<!-- ==================================== -->

<t>
Let us consider a path from a source S to a destination D, and a router R along this path
(there are typically several such routers and R is one of them).
We assume that the packet flow generated by S and destined to D uses protocol PP.
More specifically in this work we consider either ICMP/IP, UDP/IP, or TCP/IP, where IP
denotes either IPv4 or IPv6.</t>

          <figure anchor="fig:path_definitions">
            <artwork><![CDATA[
              ICMP packet
     +---------------------------+
     |     ICMP return path      |
     v                           |
+--------+  initial packet  +--------+ initial packet +-------------+
|Source S|----------------->|Router R|--------------->|Destination D|
+--------+ initial forward  +--------+ final forward  +-------------+
                 path                      path
	    ]]></artwork>
          </figure>

<t>
We can define three different paths (<xref target="fig:path_definitions"/>):
<list style="symbols">
<t> the initial forward path: this is the path between S and R;</t>
<t> the final forward path: this is the path between R and D;</t>
<t> the ICMP return path:
	This is the path taken by ICMP packets destined to S and
	generated either by R, or by a router on the final forward path, or by D itself,
	and that go through R (this is not necessarily the case);</t>
</list>
It is important to note that the initial forward path up to R and the return ICMP path
from R are not necessarily identical since routers often have different forwarding rules
for each direction.
The forward initial or final paths also potentially depend on the nature of the initial
packet protocol, since routers often use protocol dependent forwarding rules.
Finally, it is important to note that there are potentially as many ICMP return paths as
there are routers on the forwarding path.
</t>

</section>


<section title="Router behavior taxonomy">
<!-- ==================================== -->

<t>First of all, it is important to note that ICMP handling is not a global property of a router.
Said differently, two interfaces of a given router may behave differently with respect to ICMP
processing (e.g., per interface firewall configuration can explain this situation).
Therefore we need to work at the interface level.
Moreover, for each interface we also differentiate incoming and outcoming traffic.
Said differently, a router behavior from S to D may differ when considering the reverse direction,
D to S.
</t>

<t>
Let us consider traffic from a source S to a destination D, and a router R along this path.
We first identify an ability, which is not directly related to ICMP, but which has impacts
on ICMP:
<list style="numbers">
<t>Ability A0: "correct IP processing of an incoming packet (not necessarily an ICMP packet)
   on the initial forward path":
	even if this is not an ICMP packet, it may have consequences on ICMP behavior.
	For instance, if R does not decrement the IPv4 TTL/IPv6 Hop Limit field, R will
	not generate an ICMP packet if this field equals 1 upon being received by R.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
We then distinguish three ICMP-related abilities for traffic from S to D:
<list style="numbers">
<t>Ability A1: "R forwards ICMP packets destined to D on the final forward path when appropriate":
	upon receiving an ICMP packet from S, after A0 processing, when appropriate, does R forward
	it to D? </t>

<t>Ability A2: "ICMP packet generation at R":
	if an event requiring the generation of an ICMP packet occurs, does R forge an
	ICMP packet and does R return it to S, regardless of whether this packet
	arrives to S or not?
	For instance this ICMP packet can result from an IPv4 TTL/IPv6 Hop Limit
	field that decrements to 0 during the forwarding of a packet received on the
	incoming forward path;</t>

<t>Ability A3: "correct ICMP return path from R":
	when an ICMP packet is sent back to S from R (when it is generated by R) or through R
	(when it is generated by a router on the final forward path, D included), does this
	packet reach S?
	It not necessarily the case, even if R can generate ICMP packets, e.g., because of
	ICMP filtering rules;
	</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
As a particular case, we also need to assess the destination D abilities.
These abilities are essentially the same as for router R, with the distinction that:
<list style="numbers">
<t>Ability A1': "D processes ICMP packets destined to D as required by the upper layers":
	Forwarding is replaced in that case by the handling of the packet to the upper layers;</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
Those are the four main properties along which we assess R's behavior and D's behavior.
As explained, these properties are (S, D) dependent (i.e. they depend on the path and direction),
and there is no way to determine for sure all the features of router R with respect to ICMP.
For instance, the R's behavior for another interface, that is neither the two ones used for
traffic from S to D, may have completely different behavior when considering ICMP.
Note that having a full characterization of R is not required, since our goal is to help solving
ICMP black holes from S to D, and not to determine R's full configuration policies with respect
to ICMP.
</t>

</section>


<section title="Note on the use of traffic destined to R itself">
<!-- ==================================== -->

<t>
It is of common practice to probe each router R directly, e.g., with PING "Echo Request"/"Echo Reply"
packets.
This case almost corresponds to the previous case where R is the destination (D and R are identical).
A limit of this approach is that there is no strong guarantee that the initial forward path to R is identical
with a packet destined to R to the initial forward path to R with a packet destined to D.
However, this probing method can still be useful to qualify ability A3, no matter whether the initial
forward paths are the same or not.
Indeed, A3 share in both cases the same ICMP packet source (R), destination (S) and protocol (ICMP).
</t>

</section>


<section title="Path characterization with respect to ICMP">
<!-- ==================================== -->

<t>
Let us consider a path from a source S to a destination D, and let R_0, R_1, .. R_n-1 be
routers along this path.
Let us assume this path is fixed for the duration of the test (i.e., the list of the n routers
will not change).
Then the path characterization consists in providing the full list of abilities that could be
determined for each router plus the destination.
Of course, an ability A may not be determined, i.e., it can be either true or false,
which is represented by (A + !A).
</t>

          <figure anchor="fig:path_characterization_example" title="Simple path characterization example.">
            <artwork><![CDATA[
 S: 
R0: A0.!A1.A2.A3      (R0 does not forward ICMP packets)
R1: A0.(A1+!A1).A2.A3 (we cannot assert if R1 forwards ICMP or not)
 D: A0.(A1'+!A1').A2.A3
	    ]]></artwork>
          </figure>

<t>
Let us consider a simple case (<xref target="fig:path_characterization_example"/>)
with two intermediate routers, R0 and R1, where R0 does not forward ICMP packets on path S to D.
In that case there is no way to determine ability A1 on R1 and A1' on D, but other abilities
may be determined since they rely on different mechanisms. 
For example, A0 can be determined by using UDP as a probing protocol,
A2 can be determined by using a TTL value that decrements to 0 on R0, R1 or D with UDP or TCP
as probing protocol, 
and since we assume that the ICMP packet returned on the return path arrives to S, A3 is determined
too.
</t>

<t>
This examples shows that the determination of abilities for router R can impact our detection of
the abilities for router on the final forward path after R.
Of course, it does not impact the routers abilities themselves, only our view of their abilities.
Going further in the determination of all the router abilities may require additional control of
the network, for instance via vintage points (i.e., routers or hosts within the core network that
allows us to inject and observe traffic between S and D).

<section title="Main difficulties">

<t>This approach bears three main difficulties:
<list style="numbers">
	<t>fined-grain approach: because we are considering each interface of each router,
	and both directions for each interface, the number of different elements grows
	quickly;
	</t>
	<t>path variation: the topology change of Internet and the fact that the two
	paths (one for each direction) between two devices are different;
	</t>
	<t>control of Internet: it is not always possible to control the network or
	routers of the network;
	</t>

XXX: j'ai pas bien compris ces 3 points. A clarifier...
</t>
</section>
==================================== -->


<section anchor="sec:simple_example" title="A simple example">
<!-- ==================================== -->

<t>Let us consider the following example where the path between S and D crosses three
routers: R0, R1 and R2.
The user, located behind S, experiments bandwidth problems when using TCP (e.g., through
an HTTP or SSH connection), and more precisely small TCP segments reach D but not large ones.
In order to investigate the problem, the user will probably ping D and in that case will obtain
a reply.
Therefore this test is not of significant value to the user.
So the user continues investigating the problem and uses the traceroute tool, with either TCP
or ICMP as the probing protocols.
The results are presented in <xref target="fig:traceroute_example"/>.
The user can deduce that R1, whose IP address (iP_R1) is obtained by the traceroute/ICMP test,
does not forge any ICMP packet in response to TCP packets whose IPv4 TTL/IPv6 Hop Limit
is decremented to 0 on R.
Thus the user can deduce that its bandwidth problem is due to an erroneous configuration
of R1, which by not forging ICMP packets when handling TCP packets, deprives S from using
PMTUD.

<section title="Addressing complex situations: the need for dedicated tools">
<!-- ==================================== -->

<t>
If the example of <xref target="sec:simple_example"/> can relatively easily be characterized,
this is not the case with more complex situations.
In <xref target="Jacquin12"/> we detail the IBTrack (ICMP Black hole Tracker) tool that
provides a general methodology to achieve this kind of analysis.
Depending on the assumptions that can be made, different tools can also be used.
In particular if vantage points within the core network can be used, a more detailed
diagnosis can probably be made by refining the observations, using different observations from
different vantage points.
Similarly, if the destination D can be involved in the process, some abilities of the routers
may be refined, even if some of the ICMP return paths are not functioning.
</t>

<t>
Therefore the present document should be regarded as a problem position document.
Practical approaches and tools will be introduced and discussed in separate documents.
