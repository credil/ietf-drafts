Abstract

   Bandwidth on Demand services are offered by network operators in
   industry and research sectors to support the needs of selected
   customers needing high bandwidth point-to-point connections.

   Without a standard interface for controlling the use of network
   resources, user applications and services are subject to limits of
   layering, security and interoperability across multiple vendors of
   network equipment.

   In this document, we argue the necessity in providing network
   information to the applications, thereby enabling the applications
   to directly provision network elements associated with the relevant
   applications.

1. Introduction

   Bandwidth on Demand services are offered by network operators in
   industry and research sectors to support the needs of selected
   customers needing high bandwidth point-to-point connections. Such
   services take advantage of dynamic control of the underlying network
   to set up forwarding and resource allocation as requested by the
   customer.  Some control is given directly to the customer via a
   portal so that there is no need to go through an intermediate
   stage of service order provisioning on the part of the network
   operator.

   Currently such services are often based on management interfaces to
   vendor equipment that are vendor-specific, and as a result the
   operator must redesign its supporting control application for each
   vendor domain, or limit their offering to a single vendor domain.

   In this document, we propose that providing a common interface to
   networks of different vendors and technologies would enable the
   network provider to offer Bandwidth on Demand and other services
   that are faster to deploy across a wide range of network equipment
   by using additional network information.

2. Related Work

   There has been much work in this area in recent years. OpenFlow has
   defined an architecture for offering virtualized network control
   through a centralized controller and proxies called FlowVisors.
   These allow users to configure forwarding of packets within slices
   of the network partitioned off for their use.  The controller is
   designed to control each network element directly through a
   dedicated control interface.  It is not designed to work with
   existing control plane protocols.

   More generally, TMF has developed models and interfaces for
   operations and administration of networks through the north-bound
   interface provided by the element management system. These
   interfaces are not intended for real-time control of the network
   element and need to take into account variations in the design and
   features of different types of equipment.

   PCE is a client-server protocol that operates in MPLS networks that
   enables the network operators to compute and potentially provision
   optimal point-to-point and point-to-multipoint connections. However,
   PCE does not interface with applications to optimize traffic from
   user applications.



3. Problem Definition

   Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between application and
   network today, where customer control of bandwidth on demand is
   provided through applications created by the network operator
   supporting the user interface, features and backend accounting for
   the service.  Such applications are used in single domain
   deployments and have limited visibility of underlying IP/MPLS and
   Transport networks and, most importantly, resource availability on
   those networks.

        +------------------+            +------------------+

         Figure 1: Application to network relationship today



   This presents a number of challenges and problems.  Without a
   standard interface to the network elements that comprise one or more
   network domains and their associated control software, each
   bandwidth on demand supporting application must be built for a
   specific set of vendor equipment and is not easily generalizable to
   different vendors or even different equipment offered by a single
   vendor.  While signaling interfaces such as the UNI could offer
   standardized access to network control, such interfaces have not
   been adopted because they provide minimal security and functionality
   and are designed for more of a peer relationship between network
   elements, traditionally at only a single (peer) layer of the
   network.


   Similarly, bandwidth on demand applications must be designed for a
   single technology, which restricts the range of use and potential
   users.  If Domain #1 uses SDH, for example, and Domain #2 uses OTN
   it may be necessary to design supporting Application #2 from scratch
   even though Application #1 has been successfully offering service.
   Ideally the interface should allow some level of technology
   independence, as well as potentially integration to permit control
   of multiple layers simultaneously (esp. packet and circuit).


   Third, the application is generally limited to simple services
   connecting a source to destination, because interfaces hide network
   topology and do not allow visualization of the topology for
   different customer views. For some services users may wish to
   exercise control over path routing aspects such as shared risk,
   required latency characteristics or inclusion or exclusion of areas
   for policy reasons.

4. The Role of an SDN Layer

   To solve the above problem, the proposal is to introduce a software-
   driven network (SDN) layer (as shown in Figure 2), that is
   responsible for network virtualization, programmability and
   monitoring, between supporting applications and the network.


       +-------------+    +-------------+    +-------------+
       | Application |    | Application |    | Application |
       |      #1     |    |      #2     |    |      #3     |
       +-------------+    +-------------+    +-------------+
            |                  |                  |

       |     (Network virtualization, programmability      |
       |                  and Monitoring)                  |
       +---------------------------------------------------+
            |                                |
            |                                |
        +------------------+            +------------------+
        | Physical Network |            | Physical Network |
        |  Domain #1       |            |   Domain #2      |
        +------------------+            +------------------+

         Figure 2: Application to network relationship for SDN



   The purpose of the SDN Layer is to enable the applications
   supporting bandwidth on demand services to access information about
   and control (aggregate) traffic flows at various layers of the
   network through a standard, secure and customizable interface.
   Applications can visualize the traffic flows at the network layer,
   and manage the mapping or binding between its traffic flows from
   edge-to-edge through the associated networks.

   The implementation of an SDN Layer involves interfacing among
   different types of applications and different types of network
   domains, based on technology or vendor, administrative or policy
   control. Standardized interfaces must be defined to support this.

   The architecture should be agnostic as to the type of network
   control plan used in a supporting domain.  The focus of work should

   be on providing richer access to control of network resources rather
   than on the scheme for network control used in the domain.

5. Use Cases

5.1. Scheduled/ Dynamic Bandwidth On-Demand Service

   Figure 3 illustrates the flow of a scheduled or dynamic bandwidth
   service. In the simplest case, connectivity may already be provided
   between user-specified endpoints, however the bandwidth allocated
   between endpoints can be varied within some overall limit based on a
   predefined schedule or on spontaneous customer request.  Note that
   allowing bandwidth to be partitioned so that a scheduling
   application has control over some pre-allocated set of resources is
   necessary to support the scheduled BoD service.  Also, the SDN layer
   ideally hides the specific technology used to support the
   connection, offering control of the service with associated rate,
   latency and recovery features.

   In more sophisticated services, the customer may be allowed to
   create new connections within a specified set of endpoints and
   delete such connections when the connectivity is no longer required.

   private network as requested dynamically by the BoD customer.
   Different transport network technologies may be used to provide the
   server layer transport functions so that the application can evolve
   easily with new transport technologies.

                Figure 5: Virtualized network service

   Figure 5 illustrates the flow of a virtualized network service that
   offers some degree of topology visibility and control in addition to
   the features of scheduled or dynamic BoD.  For some customers it may
   be desirable to provide visibility into the topology of the
   resources they control, in order for the customer so they may
   control the physical and/or virtual topology of the resources used
   within their dedicated domain.

   If this topology information is provided together with associated
   cost, latency, SRLG, etc. for the links and nodes in the topology,
   the customer is provided with additional flexibility to manipulate
   routing of their data flows so as to balance the cost, latency,
   energy efficiency or survivability using knowledge of client
   applications and their particular needs and priorities.

   At this time such visibility is not possible to provide, as
   protocols provide either no visibility into topology or full
   visibility into topology.  For security reasons it is likely that a
   supporting network operator will want to limit visibility and
   control to some virtualized topology using functionality provided by
   the SDN orchestrator.



5.4. BoD Actions Supported by the SDN Orchestrator

   The following summarizes actions that would be supported by
   the SDN orchestrator as part of a BoD service:

   - increase or decrease bandwidth on an existing path between
     two, or more, network clients;

   - dynamically learn if resources are available, (e.g.: bandwidth,
     latency, SRLG, etc.) to create a path between two, or more,
     network clients;

   - create a path and assign associated characteristics, (e.g.:
     bandwidth, latency, SRLG, etc.) that connect two, or more, network
     clients;

   - configure mapping of packets, Ethernet frames, OTN frames, etc.
     from a client interface into a specified network path (or paths)
     connecting the appropriate ingress and egress client interfaces;

   - configure some partition of network resources (e.g., links and
     link capacity connecting some set of nodes and client endpoints)
     to be controlled by a specific application;

   - provide real or virtual topology information (links, nodes and
     associated information such as costs, latency, etc.) for this
     partition to the associated application.
