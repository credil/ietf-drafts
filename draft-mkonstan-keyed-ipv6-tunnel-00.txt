1.  Introduction

   L2TPv3, as defined in RFC3931 [RFC3931], provides a dynamic mechanism
   for tunneling Layer 2 (L2) "circuits" across a packet-oriented data
   network (e.g., over IP), with multiple attachment circuits
   multiplexed over a single pair of IP address endpoints (i.e. a
   tunnel) using the L2TPv3 session ID as a circuit discriminator.

   Implementing L2TPv3 over IPv6 provides the opportunity to utilize
   unique IPv6 addresses to identify Ethernet attachment circuits
   directly, leveraging the key property that IPv6 offers, a vast number
   of unique IP addresses.  In this case, processing of the L2TPv3
   Session ID may be bypassed upon receipt as each tunnel has one and
   only one associated session.  This local optimization does not hinder
   the ability to continue supporting the multiplexing of circuits via
   the Session ID on the same router for other L2TPv3 tunnels.

2.  Static 1:1 Mapping Without a Control Plane

   Use of the L2TPv3 Control Plane is optional.  When the control plane
   is not used, local configuration creates a one-to-one mapping between
   the access-side L2 attachment circuit and the IP address used in the
   network-side IPv6 encapsulation.  Further, circuit monitoring is
   performed using Ethernet OAM mechanisms (802.1ag and/or Y.1731).

Internet-Draft                                                 July 2013


   The L2TPv3 encapsulating router identifies each Ethernet L2
   attachment circuit by the Ethernet VLAN stack present on Ethernet
   frames on the access side

   o  port mode access - physical port identifies a L2 attachment
      circuit.

   o  single-stack access - s-tag or c-tag with S-VID or C-VID value
      identifies a L2 attachment circuit.

   o  multi-stack access - ( s-tag, c-tag ) with tuple ( S-VID, C-VID )
      identifies a L2 attachment circuit.

   L2 attachment connection identifiers s-tag or ( s-tag, c-tag ) are
   treated with local significance and are not required to be forwarded
   over the IPv6 network (though the operator may prefer to forward tags
   in some cases).

   The L2TPv3 encapsulating router identifies each L2TPv3 tunnel
   endpoint by a distinct /128 IPv6 address in the packet header of
   L2TPv3 IPv6 packets received and transmitted on the network side.

   In the event that an IPv6 address used in L2TPv3 does not directly
   correspond to one and only one attachment circuit on both sides of
   the L2TPv3 tunnel, the Session ID may be used for additional
   granularity.  This allows for other addressing schemes that may
   require additional bits beyond those which can fit in the IPv6 header
   address field.

3.  64-bit Authentication Key

   All packets MUST carry a 64-bit authentication key in the L2TPv3
   cookie field.  The cookie MUST be 64-bits long in order to provide
   sufficient protection against a brute force blind insertion attack.

   In absence of the L2TPv3 Control Plane, the L2TPv3 encapsulating
   router must be provided with local configuration of the 64-bit
   authentication cookie for each local and remote IPv6 endpoint - note
   that cookies are asymmetric, so local and remote endpoints may send
   different cookie values.  The value of the cookie must be able to be
   changed at any time in a manner that does not drop any legitimate
   tunneled packets - i.e. the receiver must be willing to accept both
   "old" and "new" cookie values during a change of cookie value.

4.  Encapsulation

   RFC4719 [RFC4719] describes encapsulation of Ethernet over L2TPv3.

   preamble or frame check sequence (FCS), is encapsulated in L2TPv3 and
   is sent as a single packet by the ingress router.

   The s-tag (or in the multi-stack access case the s-tag and c-tag)
   SHOULD be removed before the packet is encapsulated.

   The full encapsulation is as follows:

   The combined IPv6 and L2TPv3 header contains the following fields:

   o  Ver. Set to 0x6 to indicate IPv6.

   o  Traffic Class.  May be set by the ingress router to ensure correct
      PHB treatment by transit routers between the ingress and egress,
      and correct QoS disposition at the egress router.

   o  Flow Label.  May be set by the ingress router to indicate a flow
      of packets from the client which may not be reordered by the
      network (if there is a requirement for finer grained ECMP load
      balancing than per-circuit load balancing).

   o  Payload Length.  Set to the length of the packet, excluding the
      IPv6 header (i.e. the length from the Session ID to the end of the
      packet).

   o  Next Header.  Set to 0x73 to indicate that the next header is
      L2TPv3.

   o  Hop Limit.  Set to 0xFF, and decremented by one by each router in
      the path to the egress router.

   o  Source Address.  IPv6 source address for the tunnel.  In the
      "Static 1:1" case the IPv6 source address may correspond to a port
      or VLAN being transported as an L2 circuit, or may be a loopback
      address terminating inside the router (e.g. if L2 circuits are
      being used within a multipoint VPN) or may be an anycast address
      terminating on a data center virtual machine.

   o  Destination Address.  IPv6 destination address for the tunnel.  As
      with the source address this may correspond to a port or VLAN
      being transported as an L2 circuit or may be a loopback or anycast
      address.

   o  Session ID.  In the "Static 1:1 mapping" case described in
      Section 2, the IPv6 address resolves to an L2TPv3 session
      immediately, thus the Session ID may be ignored upon receipt.  For
      compatibility with other tunnel termination platforms supporting
      only 2-stage resolution (IPv6 Address + Session ID), this
      specification recommends supporting explicit configuration of
      Session ID to any value other than zero.  For cases where both
      tunnel endpoints support one-stage resolution (IPv6 Address only),
      this specification recommends setting the Session ID to all ones
      for easy identification in case of troubleshooting.

   o  Cookie. 64 bits, configured and described as in Section 3.  All
      packets for a destined L2 Circuit (or L2TPv3 Session) must match
      the configured Cookie value or be discarded (see RFC3931 [RFC3931]
      for more details).

   o  Payload.  The customer data, with s-tag or s-tag/c-tag removed.
      As noted above preamble and FCS are stripped before encapsulation.
      A new FCS will be added at each hop when the IP packet is
      transmitted.

5.  IANA Considerations

   None.

6.  Security Considerations

   Packet spoofing for any type of Virtual Private Network (VPN)
   tunneling protocol is of particular concern as insertion of carefully
   constructed rogue packets into the VPN transit network could result
   in a violation of VPN traffic separation, leaking data into a
   customer VPN.  This is complicated by the fact that it may be
   particularly difficult for the operator of the VPN to even be aware
   that it has become a point of transit into or between customer VPNs.

   Keyed IPv6 encapsulation provides traffic separation for its VPNs via
   use of separate 128-bit IPv6 addresses to identify the endpoints.
   The mandatory authentication key carried in the L2TPv3 cookie field,
   provides an additional check to ensure that an arriving packet is
   intended for the identified tunnel.

   In the presence of a blind packet spoofing attack, the authentication
   key provides security against inadvertent leaking of frames into a
   customer VPN, like in case of L2TPv3 RFC3931 [RFC3931].  To
   illustrate the type of security that it is provided in this case,
   consider comparing the validation of a 64-bit Cookie in the L2TPv3
   header to the admission of packets that match a given source and
   destination IP address pair.  Both the source and destination IP
   address pair validation and Cookie validation consist of a fast check
   on cleartext header information on all arriving packets.  However,
   since L2TPv3 uses its own value, it removes the requirement for one
   to maintain a list of (potentially several) permitted or denied IP
   addresses, and moreover, to guard knowledge of the permitted IP
   addresses from hackers who may obtain and spoof them.  Further, it is
   far easier to change a compromised L2TPv3 Cookie than a compromised
   IP address," and a cryptographically random RFC4086 [RFC4086] value
   is far less likely to be discovered by brute-force attacks compared
   to an IP address.

   For protection against brute-force, blind, insertion attacks, a 64-
   bit Cookie MUST be used with all tunnels.

   Note that the Cookie provides no protection against a sophisticated
   man-in-the-middle attacker who can sniff and correlate captured data
   between nodes for use in a coordinated attack.

   The L2TPv3 64-bit cookie must not be regarded as a substitute for
   security such as that provided by IPsec when operating over an open
   or untrusted network where packets may be sniffed, decoded, and
   correlated for use in a coordinated attack.
