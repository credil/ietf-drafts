1.  Introduction

   The User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple
   Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3) is specified in RFC 3414
   [RFC3414].  Within USM, two different authentication protocols, HMAC-
   MD5-96 and HMAC-SHA-96, are defined based on the hash functions MD5
   and SHA-1, respectively.  This memo specifies a new HMAC-SHA-256-128
   authentication protocol for USM using an HMAC based on the SHA-256
   hash function [SHA] and truncated to 128 bits.  The protocol is a
   straightforward adaptation of the authentication protocols HMAC-
   MD5-96 and HMAC-SHA-96 to the SHA-256 based HMAC.  The use and
   support of the HMAC-SHA-256-128 authentication protocol is OPTIONAL.

2.  The HMAC-SHA-256-128 Authentication Protocol

   This section describes the HMAC-SHA-256-128 authentication protocol.
   This protocol uses the SHA-256 hash function which is described in
   [SHA], in HMAC mode described in [RFC2104], truncating the output to
   128 bits.  Source code for SHA-256 and HMAC-SHA-256 (without
   truncation) can be found in [RFC4634].  Test vectors for HMAC-SHA-256
   (without truncation) and HMAC-SHA-256-128 are given in [RFC4231] and
   in [RFC4868], respectively.

   This protocol is identified by usmHMACSHA256AuthProtocol.

2.1.  Deviations from the HMAC-SHA-96 Authentication Protocol

   The HMAC-SHA-256-128 authentication protocol is a straightforward
   adaptation of the HMAC-MD5-96 and HMAC-SHA-96 authentication
   protocols.  Precisely, it differs from the HMAC-MD5-96 and HMAC-
   SHA-96 authentication protocols in the following aspects:

   o  The SHA-256 hash function is used to compute the message digest in
      the HMAC computation according to [RFC2104], as opposed to the MD5

      hash function [RFC1321] and SHA-1 hash function [SHA] used in
      HMAC-MD5-96 and HMAC-SHA-96, respectively.  Consequently, the
      length of the message digest prior to truncation is 256 bits.

   o  The 256 bit message digest is truncated to 16 octets as opposed to
      the truncation to 12 octets in HMAC-MD5-96 and HMAC-SHA-96.

   o  The user's secret key to be used when calculating a digest MUST be
      32 octets long as opposed to the keys being 16 and 20 octets long
      in HMAC-MD5-96 and HMAC-SHA-96, respectively.

2.2.  Processing

   This section describes the procedures for the HMAC-SHA-256-128
   authentication protocol.  The descriptions are based on the
   definition of services and data elements defined for HMAC-SHA-96 in
   RFC 3414 [RFC3414] with the deviations listed in Section 2.1.

2.2.1.  Processing an Outgoing Message

   This section describes the procedure followed by an SNMP engine
   whenever it must authenticate an outgoing message using the
   usmHMACSHA256AuthProtocol.

   1.  The msgAuthenticationParameters field is set to serialization,
       according to the rules in [RFC3417], of an OCTET STRING
       containing 16 zero octets.

   2.  From the secret authKey, two keys K1 and K2 are derived:

       a)  extend the authKey to 64 octets by appending 32 zero octets;
             save it as extendedAuthKey;

       b)  obtain IPAD by replicating the octet 0x36 64 times;

       c)  obtain K1 by XORing extendedAuthKey with IPAD;

       d)  obtain OPAD by replicating the octet 0x5C 64 times;

       e)  obtain K2 by XORing extendedAuthKey with OPAD.

   3.  Prepend K1 to the wholeMsg and calculate the SHA-256 digest over
       it according to [SHA].

   4.  Prepend K2 to the result of the previous step and calculate the
       SHA-256 digest over it according to [SHA].  Take the first 16
       octets of the final digest - this is the Message Authentication
       Code (MAC).

   5.  Replace the msgAuthenticationParameters field with the MAC
       obtained in the previous step.

   6.  The authenticatedWholeMsg is then returned to the caller together
       with statusInformation indicating success.

2.2.2.  Processing an Incoming Message

   This section describes the procedure followed by an SNMP engine
   whenever it must authenticate an incoming message using the
   usmHMACSHA256AuthProtocol.

   1.  If the digest received in the msgAuthenticationParameters field
      is not 16 octets long, then an failure and an errorIndication
      (authenticationError) is returned to the calling module.

   2.  The MAC received in the msgAuthenticationParameters field is
      saved.

   3.  The digest in the msgAuthenticationParameters field is replaced
      by the 16 zero octets.

   4.  From the secret authKey, two keys K1 and K2 are derived:

      a)  extend the authKey to 64 octets by appending 32 zero octets;
            save it as extendedAuthKey

      b)  obtain IPAD by replicating the octet 0x36 64 times;

      c)  obtain K1 by XORing extendedAuthKey with IPAD;

      d)  obtain OPAD by replicating the octet 0x5C 64 times;

      e)  obtain K2 by XORing extendedAuthKey with OPAD.

   5.  The MAC is calculated over the wholeMsg:

      a)  prepend K1 to the wholeMsg and calculate the SHA-256 digest
            over it;

      b)  prepend K2 to the result of step 5.a and calculate the SHA-256
            digest over it;

      c)  first 16 octets of the result of step 5.b is the MAC.

      The msgAuthenticationParameters field is replaced with the MAC
      value that was saved in step 2.

   6.  The newly calculated MAC is compared with the MAC saved in step
      2.  If they do not match, then a failure and an errorIndication
      (authenticationFailure) are returned to the calling module.

   7.  The authenticatedWholeMsg and statusInformation indicating
      success are then returned to the caller.

3.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC3414] also apply to the use of the
   HMAC-SHA-256-128 authentication protocol in SNMP.  A general
   discussion of the security of the HMAC construction is given in
   [RFC2104].

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an OID for the usmHMACSHA256AuthProtocol
   module under the SnmpAuthProtocols subtree, maintained in the
   registry at http://www.iana.org/assignments/smi-numbers.
