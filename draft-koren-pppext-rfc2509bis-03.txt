This document describes an option for negotiating the use of header
compression on IP datagrams transmitted over the Point-to-Point
Protocol (RFC 1661).  It defines extensions to the PPP Control
Protocols for IPv4 and IPv6 (RFC 1332, RFC 2472).  Header compression
may be applied to IPv4 and IPv6 datagrams in combination with TCP,
UDP and RTP transport protocols as specified in RFC 2507,
RFC 2508 and RFC 3545.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
