        This document describes an extension to the Interactive
        Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol that allows ICE agents
        to send and receive candidates incrementally rather than
        exchanging complete lists. With such incremental provisioning,
        ICE agents can begin connectivity checks while they are still
        gathering candidates and considerably shorten the time necessary
        for ICE processing to complete.
      </t>
      <t>
        The above mechanism is also referred to as "trickle ICE".

    <section title='Introduction'>
      <t>
        The Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol
        <xref target="RFC5245"/> describes mechanisms for gathering,
        candidates, prioritizing them, choosing default ones, exchanging
        them with the remote party, pairing them and ordering them into
        check lists. Once all of the above have been completed, and only
        then, the participating agents can begin a phase of connectivity
        checks and eventually select the pair of candidates that will be
        used in the following session.
      </t>
      <t>
        While the above sequence has the advantage of being relatively
        straightforward to implement and debug once deployed, it may
        also prove to be rather lengthy. Gathering candidates or
        candidate harvesting would often involve things like querying
        <xref target="RFC5389">STUN</xref> servers, discovering UPnP
        devices, and allocating relayed candidates at
        <xref target="RFC5766">TURN</xref> servers. All of these can
        be delayed for a noticeable amount of time and while they can be
        run in parallel, they still need to respect the pacing
        requirements from <xref target="RFC5245"/>, which is likely to
        delay them even further. Some or all of the above would also
        have to be completed by the remote agent. Both agents would
        next perform connectivity checks and only then would they be
        ready to begin streaming media.
      </t>
      <t>
        All of the above could lead to relatively lengthy session
        establishment times and degraded user experience.
      </t>
      <t>
        The purpose of this document is to define an alternative mode of
        operation for ICE implementations, also known as "trickle ICE",
        where candidates can be exchanged incrementally. This would
        allow ICE agents to exchange host candidates as soon as a
        session has been initiated. Connectivity checks for a media
        stream would also start as soon as the first candidates for that
        stream have become available.
      </t>
      <t>
        Trickle ICE allows reducing session establishment times in cases
        where connectivity is confirmed for the first exchanged
        candidates (e.g. where the host candidates for one of the agents
        are directly reachable from the second agent). Even when this is
        not the case, running candidate harvesting for both agents and
        connectivity checks all in parallel allows to considerably
        reduce ICE processing times.
      </t>
      <t>
        It is worth pointing out that before being introduced to the
        IETF, trickle ICE had already been included in specifications
        such as <xref target="XEP-0176">XMPP Jingle</xref> and it has
        been in use in various implementations and deployments.
      </t>
      <t>
        In addition to the basics of trickle ICE, this document also
        describes how support for trickle ICE needs to be discovered,
        how regular ICE processing needs to be modified when
        building and updating check lists, and how trickle ICE
        implementations should interoperate with agents that only
        implement <xref target="RFC5245"/> processing.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification does not define usage of trickle ICE with any
        specific signalling protocol, contrary to
        <xref target="RFC5245"/> which contains a usage for ICE wht SIP.
        Such usages would have to be specified in separate documents.
      </t>
      <t>
        Trickle ICE does however reuse and build upon the SDP syntax
        defined by vanilla ICE.

    <section title='Incompatibility with Standard ICE'
             anchor='incompat'>
      <t>
        The ICE protocol was designed to be fairly flexible so that it
        would work in and adapt to as many network environments as
        possible. It is hence important to point out at least some of
        the reasons why, despite its flexibility, the specification in
        <xref target="RFC5245"/> would not support trickle ICE.
      </t>
      <t>
        <xref target="RFC5245"/> describes the conditions required to
        update check lists and timer states while an ICE agent is in the
        Running state. These conditions are verified upon transaction
        completion and one of them stipulates that:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style='empty'>
          <t>
            If there is not a pair in the valid list for each component
            of the media stream, the state of the check list is set to
            Failed.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        This could be a problem and cause ICE processing to fail
        prematurely in a number of scenarios. Consider the following
        case:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>
            Alice and Bob are both located in different networks with
            Network Address Translation (NAT). Alice and Bob themselves
            have different address but both networks use the same
            <xref target="RFC1918"/> block.
          </t>
          <t>
            Alice sends Bob the candidate 10.0.0.10 which also happens
            to correspond to an existing host on Bob's network.
          </t>
          <t>
            Bob creates a check list consisting solely of 10.0.0.10 and
            starts checks.
          </t>
          <t>
            These checks reach the host at 10.0.0.10 in Bob's network,
            which responds with an ICMP "port unreachable" error and per
            <xref target="RFC5245"/> Bob marks the transaction as
            Failed.
          </t>
        </list>
        At this point the check list only contains Failed candidates and
        the valid list is empty. This causes the media stream and
        potentially all ICE processing to Fail.
      </t>
      <t>
        A similar race condition would occur if the initial offer from
        Alice only contains candidates that can be determined as
        unreachable (per
        <xref target="I-D.keranen-mmusic-ice-address-selection"/>) from
        any of the candidates that Bob has gathered. This would be the
        case if Bob's candidates only contain IPv4 addresses and the
        first candidate that he receives from Alice is an IPv6 one.
      </t>
      <t>
        Another potential problem could arise when a non-trickle
        ICE implementation sends an offer to a trickle one. Consider the
        following case:
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>
            Alice's client has a non-trickle ICE implementation
          </t>
          <t>
            Bob's client has support for trickle ICE.
          </t>
          <t>
            Alice and Bob are behind NATs with address-dependent
            filtering <xref target="RFC4787"/>.
          </t>
          <t>
            Bob has two STUN servers but one of them is currently
            unreachable
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        After Bob's agent receives Alice's offer it would immediately
        start connectivity checks. It would also start gathering
        candidates, which would take long because of the unreachable
        STUN server. By the time Bob's answer is ready and sent to
        Alice, Bob's connectivity checks may well have failed: until
        Alice gets Bob's answer, she won't be able to start connectivity
        checks and punch holes in her NAT. The NAT would hence be
        filtering Bob's checks as originating from an unknown endpoint.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='Determining Support for Trickle ICE' anchor="disco">
      <t>
        According to <xref target="RFC5245"/> every time an agent
        supporting trickle ICE generates an offer or an answer, it MUST
        include the "trickle" token in the ice-options attribute.
        Syntax for this token is defined in <xref target="sdp.offer"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        Additionally, in order to avoid interoperability problems such
        as those described in <xref target="incompat"/>, it is important
        that trickle ICE negotiation is only attempted in cases where
        the remote party actually supports this specification. Agents
        that receive offers or answers can verify support by examining
        them for the "trickle" ice-options token. However, agents
        that are about to send a first offer, have no immediate way of
        doing this. This means that usages of trickle for specific
        protocols would need to either:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>
            Provide a way for agents to verify support of trickle ICE
            prior to initiating a session. XMPP's
            <xref target="XEP-0030"> Service discovery</xref> is an
            example for one such mechanism;
          </t>
          <t>
            Make support for trickle ICE mandatory so that support could
            be assumed the agents.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        Alternately, for cases where a protocol provides neither of the
        above, agents may either rely on provisioning/configuration, or
        use the half trickle procedure described in
        <xref target="half-trickle"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        Note that out-of-band discovery semantics and half trickle are
        only necessary prior to session initiation, or in other words,
        when sending the initial offer. Once a session is established
        and trickle ICE support is confirmed for both parties, either
        agent can use full trickle for subsequent offers.
      </t>
      <section title='Unilateral Use of Trickle ICE (Half Trickle)'
               anchor="half-trickle">
        <t>
          The idea of using half trickle is about having the caller
          send a regular, vanilla ICE offer, with a complete set of
          candidates. This offer still indicates support for
          trickle ice, so the answerer is able to respond with an
          incomplete set of candidates and continue trickling the rest.
          Half trickle offers will typically contain an
          end-of-candidates indication.
        </t>
        <t>
          The mechanism can be used in cases where there is no way for
          an agent to verify in advance whether a remote party supports
          trickle ice. Because it contains a full set of candidates, its
          first offer can thus be handled by a regular vanilla ICE
          agent, while still allowing a trickle one to use the
          optimisation defined in this specification. This prevents
          negotiation from failing in the former case while still giving
          roughly half the trickle ICE benefits in the latter (hence the
          name of the mechanism).
        </t>
        <t>
          Use of half trickle is only necessary during an initial
          offer/answer exchange. Once both parties have received a
          session description from their peer, they can each reliably
          determine trickle ICE support and use it for all subsequent
          offer/answer exchanges.
        </t>
        <t>
          It is worth pointing out that using half trickle may actually
          bring more than just half the improvement in terms of user
          experience. This can happen in cases where an agent
          starts gathering candidates upon user interface cues that a
          call is pending, such as activity on a keypad or the phone
          going off hook. This would mean a part or all candidate
          harvesting could have completed before the agent actually
          needs to send the offer. Given that the answerer will be able
          to trickle candidates, both agents will be able to start
          connectivity checks and complete ICE processing earlier than
          with vanilla ICE and potentially even as early as with full
          trickle.
        </t>
        <t>
          However, such anticipation is not not always possible. For
          example, a multipurpose user agent or a WebRTC web page where
          communication is a non-central feature (e.g. calling a support
          line in case of a problem with the main features) would not
          necessarily have a way of distinguishing between call
          intentions and other user activity. Still, even in these
          cases, using half trickle would be an improvement over vanilla
          ICE as it would optimize performance for answerers.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section title='Sending the Initial Offer' anchor="initial-offer">
      <t>
        An agent starts gathering candidates as soon as it has an
        indication that communication is imminent (e.g. a user interface
        cue or an explicit request to initiate a session). Contrary to
        vanilla ICE, implementations of trickle ICE do not need to
        gather candidates in a blocking manner. Therefore, unless half
        trickle is being used, agents SHOULD generate and transmit their
        initial offer as early as possible, in order to allow the remote
        party to start gathering and trickling candidates.
      </t>
      <t>
        Trickle ICE agents MAY include any set of candidates in an
        offer. This includes the possibility of generating one with no
        candidates, or one that contains all the candidates that the
        agent is planning on using in the following session.
      </t>
      <t>
        For optimal performance, it is RECOMMENDED that an initial offer
        contains host candidates only. This would allow both agents to
        start gathering server reflexive, relayed and other non-host
        candidates simultaneously, and it would also enable them to
        begin connectivity checks.
      </t>
      <t>
        If the privacy implications of revealing host addresses are a
        concern, agents MAY generate an offer that contains no
        candidates and then only trickle candidates that do not reveal
        host addresses (e.g. relayed candidates).
      </t>
      <t>
        Prior to actually sending an initial offer, agents MAY verify if
        the remote party supports trickle ICE, where such mechanisms
        actually exist. If absence of such support is confirmed agents
        MUST fall back to using vanilla ICE or abandon the entire
        session.
      </t>
      <t>
        All trickle ICE offers and answers MUST indicate support of this
        specification, as explained in <xref target="sdp.offer"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        Calculating priorities and foundations, as well as determining
        redundancy of candidates work the same way they do with vanilla
        ICE.
      </t>
      <section title='Encoding the SDP' anchor="sdp.offer">
        <t>
          The process of encoding the SDP <xref target="RFC4566"/> is
          mostly the same as the one used by vanilla ICE. Still, trickle
          ICE does require a few differences described here.
        </t>
        <t>
          Agents MUST indicate support for Trickle ICE by including the
          "trickle" token for the "a=ice-options" attribute:
          <figure>
            <artwork>

        </t>
        <t>
          As mentioned earlier in this section, Offers and Answers can
          contain any set of candidates, which means that a trickle ICE
          session description MAY contain no candidates at all. In such
          cases the agent would still need to place an address in the
          "c=" line(s). If the use of a host address there is
          undesirable (e.g. for privacy reasons), the agent MAY set the
          connection address to 0.0.0.0. In this case it MUST also
          set the port number to 1. There is no need to include a
          fictitious 0.0.0.0 candidate when doing so.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section title='Receiving the Initial Offer' >
      <t>
        When an agent receives an initial offer, it will first check if
        it indicates support for trickle ICE as explained in
        <xref target="disco"/>. If this is not the case, the agent MUST
        process the offer according to the <xref target="RFC5245"/>
        procedures or standard <xref target="RFC3264"/> processing in
        case no ICE support is detected at all.
      </t>
      <t>
        It is worth pointing out that in case support for trickle ICE is
        confirmed, an agent will automatically assume support for
        vanilla ICE as well even if the support verification procedure
        in <xref target="RFC5245"/> indicates otherwise. Specifically,
        such verification would indicate lack of support when the offer
        contains no candidates. The 0.0.0.0 address present in the c=
        line in that case would not "appear in a candidate attribute".
        Obviously, a fallback to <xref target="RFC3264"/> is not
        required when this happens.
      </t>
      <t>
        If, the offer does indicate support for trickle ICE, the agent
        will determine its role, start gathering and prioritizing
        candidates and, while doing so it will also respond by sending
        its own answer, so that both agents can start forming check
        lists and begin connectivity checks.

      <section title="Sending the Initial Answer">
        <t>
          An agent can respond to an initial offer at any point while
          gathering candidates. The answer can again contain any set of
          candidates including none or all of them. Unless it is
          protecting host addresses for privacy reasons, the agent would
          typically construct this initial answer including only them,
          thus allowing the remote party to also start forming
          checklists and performing connectivity checks.
        </t>

          The answer MUST indicate support for trickle ICE as described

        <t>
          After exchanging offer and answer, and as soon as they have
          obtained local and remote candidates, agents will begin
          forming candidate pairs, computing their priorities and
          creating check lists according to the vanilla ICE procedures
          described in <xref target="RFC5245"/>. Obviously in order for
          candidate pairing to be possible, it would be necessary that
          both the offer and the answer contained candidates. If this
          was not the case agents will still create the check lists (so
          that their Active/Frozen state could be monitored and updated)
          but they will only populate them once they actually have the
          candidates.
        </t>
        <t>
          Initially, all check lists will have their Active/Frozen state
          set to Frozen.
        </t>
        <t>
          Trickle ICE agents will then also attempt to unfreeze the
          check list for the first media stream (i.e. the first media
          stream that was reported to the ICE implementation from the
          using application). If this checklist is still empty however,
          agents will continue examining media streams in the order they
          were reported and will unfreeze the first non-empty checklist.
        </t>
        <t>
          Respecting the order in which lists have been reported to an
          ICE implementation, or in other words, the order in which
          they appear in SDP, is helpful so that checks for the same
          media stream is more likely to be performed simultaneously by
          both agents.

      </t>
    </section>
    <section title='Performing Connectivity Checks' >
      <t>
        For the most part, trickle ICE agents perform connectivity
        checks following vanilla ICE procedures. Of course, the
        asynchronous nature of candidate harvesting in trickle ICE would
        impose a number of changes described here.
      </t>
      <section title="Check List and Timer State Updates"
               anchor="state-updates">
        <t>
          The vanilla ICE specification requires that agents update
          check lists and timer states upon completing a connectivity
          check transaction. During such an update vanilla ICE agents
          would set the state of a check list to Failed if the following
          two conditions are satisfied:
        </t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              all of the pairs in the check list are either in the
              Failed or Succeeded state;
            </t>
            <t>
              if at least one of the components of the media stream
              has no pairs in its valid list.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          With trickle ICE, the above situation would often occur when
          candidate harvesting and trickling are still in progress and
          it is perfectly possible that future checks will succeed. For
          this reason trickle ICE agents add the following conditions to
          the above list:
        </t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              all candidate harvesters have completed and the agent
              is not expecting to learn any new candidates;
            </t>
            <t>
              the remote agent has sent an end-of-candidates indication
              for that check list as described in
              <xref target="end-of-candidates"/>.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          Vanilla ICE requires that agents then update all other check
          lists, placing one pair in each of them into the Waiting
          state, effectively unfreezing the check list. Given that
          with trickle ICE, other check lists may still be empty at that
          point, a trickle ICE agent SHOULD also maintain an explicit
          Active/Frozen state for every check list, rather than deducing
          it from the state of the pairs it contains. This state should
          be set to Active when unfreezing the first pair in a list
          or when that couldn't happen because a list was empty.

      </section>

    <section title='Learning and Sending Additional Local Candidates'
             anchor="send-trickling">
      <t>
        After an offer or an answer have been sent, agents will most
        likely continue discovering new local candidates as STUN, TURN
        and other non-host candidate harvesting mechanisms begin to
        yield results. Whenever such a new candidate is learned agents
        will compute its priority, type, foundation and component id
        according to normal vanilla ICE procedures.
      </t>
      <t>
        The new candidate is then checked for redundancy against the
        existing list of local candidates. If its transport address and
        base match those of an existing candidate, it will be considered
        redundant and will be ignored. This would often happen for
        server reflexive candidates that match the host addresses they
        were obtained from (e.g. when the latter are public IPv4
        addresses). Contrary to vanilla ICE, trickle ICE agents will
        consider the new candidate redundant regardless of its priority.
        [TODO: is this OK? if not we need to check if the existing
        candidate was already used in conn checks, cancel them, and then
        restart them with the new candidate ... and in this specific
        case there's probably no point to do that].
      </t>
      <t>
        Then, if no remote candidates are currently known for this same
        stream, the new candidate will simply be added to the list of
        local candidates.
      </t>
      <t>
        Otherwise, if the agent has already learned of one or more
        remote candidates for this stream and component, it will begin
        pairing the new local candidates with them and adding the pairs
        to the existing check lists according to their priority. Forming
        candidate pairs will work the way it is described by the vanilla
        ICE specification. Actually adding the new pair to a check list
        however, will happen according to the rules described below.
      </t>
      <t>
        If the new pair's local candidate is server reflexive, the
        server reflexive candidate MUST be replaced by its base before
        adding the pair to the list. Once this is done, the agent
        examines the check list looking for another pair that would be
        redundant with the new one. If such a pair exists and its state
        is:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Succeeded: ">

          </t>
          <t hangText="Frozen or Waiting: ">
            the agent chooses the pair with the higher priority local
            candidate, places it in the state that the old pair was in
            (i.e. Frozen or Waiting) and removes the other one as
            redundant.
          </t>
          <t hangText="Failed: ">
            the agent chooses the pair with the higher priority local

          </t>
          <t hangText="In-Progress: ">
            The agent cancels the in-progress transaction (where
            cancellation happens as explained in Section 7.2.1.4 of
            <xref target="RFC5245"/>), then it chooses the pair with the
            higher priority local candidate, places it in the Waiting
            state and removes the other one as redundant.

      <section title="Encoding the SDP for Additional Candidates">
        <t>
          To facilitate interoperability an ICE agent will encode
          additional candidates using the vanilla ICE SDP syntax. For
          example:
          <figure>
            <artwork>
<![CDATA[
    a=candidate:2 1 UDP 1658497328 198.51.100.33 5000 typ host
]]>
            </artwork>
          </figure>
          Given that such lines do not provide a relationship between
          the candidate and the m line that it relates to, signalling
          protocols using trickle ICE MUST establish that relation
          themselves. This can be done in one of two ways: using the
          m-line index, or an <xref target="RFC3388">MID</xref>. The
          m-line index is a zero-based index, referring to the Nth
          m-line in the SDP. The MID uses "media stream identification",
          as defined in <xref target="RFC3388"/>, to identify the
          m-line. When creating candidate lines usages of trickle ICE
          SHOULD use the MID if possible, or the m-line index if not.
          Agents MUST NOT send individual candidates any prior to
          generating the corresponding SDP session description.
        </t>
        <t>
          The exact means of transporting additional candidates to a
          remote agent is left to the protocols using trickle ICE. It is
          important to note, however, that these candidate exchanges are
          not part of the offer/answer model. [TODO: or should we pick
          one of the two? Is there any reason not to mandate MID?]
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title='Announcing End of Candidates'
             anchor="end-of-candidates">
      <t>
        Once all candidate harvesters for a specific media stream
        complete, or expire, the agent MUST generate an
        "end-of-candidates" indication for that stream and send it to
        the remote agent via the signalling channel. The SDP
        representation for end-of-candidates following form:
        <figure>

        </figure>
        The end-of-candidates notifications can be sent as part of an
        offer, which would typically be the case with half trickle
        initial offers, they can accompany the last candidate an agent
        can send for a stream, and they can also be sent alone (e.g.
        after STUN Binding requests or TURN Allocate requests to a
        server timeout and the agent has no other active harvesters).
      </t>
      <t>
        Receiving an end-of-candidates notification allows an agent to
        update check list states and, in case valid pairs do not exist
        for every component in every media stream, determine that ICE
        processing has failed.
      </t>
      <t>
        An agent MAY also choose to generate an end-of-candidates
        event before candidate harvesting has actually completed, if the
        agent determines that harvesting has continued for more than an
        acceptable period of time. However, an agent MUST NOT send any
        more candidates after it has send an end-of-candidates
        notification.
      </t>
      <t>
        Half trickle agents SHOULD send end-of-candidates together with
        their initial offer unless they are planning on potentially
        sending additional candidates in case the remote party turns out
        to actually support trickle ICE. (TODO: can this be useful?)
      </t>
      <t>
        Once the agent sends the end-of-candidates event, it will

    <section title='Open issues'>
      <t>
        At the time of writing of this document the authors have no
        clear view on how and if the following list of issues should
        be addressed.
      </t>
      <section title="MID/Stream Indices in SDP">
        <t>
          This specification does not currently define syntax for
          candidate-to-stream bindings although it says that they should
          be implemented with MID or a stream index. Yet, it is
          reasonable to assume that most usages would need to do this
          within the SDP and it may make sense to agree on the format.
          Here's one possible way to do this:

      <section title="ICE Lite and Candidate Signalling">
        <t>
          ICE Lite implementations of Trickle ICE do not necessarily
          need to receive candidates from their peers: it would be
          enough for them to start getting checks and discover all
          candidates as peer reflexive. This would allow to reduce
          signalling traffic but could introduce other issues.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Handling new candidates after check completion">
        <t>
          Basically, do any new candidates discovered after ICE
          completes (e.g. from a new interface that comes up) need an
          ICE restart, or not?
        </t>
      </section>

    <section title='Changes From Earlier Versions'>
      <t>
        Note to the RFC-Editor: please remove this section prior to
        publication as an RFC.
      </t>
      <section title='Changes From draft-rescorla-01'>
        <t>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>
              Brought back explicit use of Offer/Answer. There are no
              more attempts to try to do this in an O/A independent way.
              Also removed the use of ICE Descriptions.
            </t>
            <t>
              Added SDP specification for trickled candidates, the
              trickle option and 0.0.0.0 addresses in m-lines, and
              end-of-candidates.
            </t>
            <t>
              Support and Discovery. Changed that section to be less
              abstract. As discussed in IETF85, the draft now says
              implementations and usages need to either determine
              support in advance and directly use trickle, or do
              half trickle. Removed suggestion about use of discovery in
              SIP or about letting implementing protocols do what they
              want.
            </t>
            <t>
              Defined Half Trickle. Added a section that says how it
              works. Mentioned that it only needs to happen in the first
              o/a (not necessary in updates), and added Jonathan's
              comment about how it could, in some cases, offer more than
              half the improvement if you can pre-gather part or all of
              your candidates before the user actually presses the call
              button.
            </t>
            <t>
              Added a short section about subsequent offer/answer
              exchanges.
            </t>
            <t>
              Added a short section about interactions with ICE Lite
              implementations.
            </t>
            <t>
              Added two new entries to the open issues section.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title='Changes From draft-rescorla-00'>
        <t>
          <list style='symbols'>
            <t>
              Relaxed requirements about verifying support following
              a discussion on MMUSIC.
            </t>
            <t>
              Introduced ICE descriptions in order to remove ambiguous
              use of 3264 language and inappropriate references to
              offers and answers.
            </t>
            <t>
              Removed inappropriate assumption of adoption by RTCWEB
              pointed out by Martin Thomson.
