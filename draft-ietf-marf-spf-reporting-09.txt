Internet-Draft         SPF Auth Failure Reporting             March 2012


1.  Introduction

   [ARF] defines a message format for sending reports of abuse in the
   messaging infrastructure, with an eye toward automating both the
   generating and consumption of those reports.

   [SPF] is one mechanism for message sender authentication; it is
   "path-based" meaning it authenticates the route that a message took
   from origin to destination.  The output is a verified domain name
   that can then be subjected to some sort of evaluation process (e.g.,
   comparison to a known-good list, submission to a reputation service,
   etc.).

   This document extends [SPF] to add an optional reporting address and
   other parameters.  Extension of [ARF] to add features required for
   the reporting of these incidents is covered in
   [I-D.IETF-MARF-AUTHFAILURE-REPORT] and [I-D.IETF-MARF-AS].

   This document additionally creates a an IANA registry of [SPF] record
   modifiers to avoid modifier namespace collisions.

3.  Optional Reporting Address for SPF

   There exist cases in which an ADministrative Management Domain (ADMD)
   (see [EMAIL-ARCH]) employing [SPF] for announcing sending practices
   may want to know when messages are received via unauthorized routing.
   Currently there is no such method defined in conjunction with
   standardized approaches such as [ARF].  Similar information can be
   gathered using a specially crafted [SPF] record and a special DNS
   server to track [SPF] record lookups.

   This document defines the following optional "modifier" (as defined
   in Section 4.6.1 of [SPF]) to SPF records, using the form defined in
   that specification:

   ra=  Reporting Address (plain-text; OPTIONAL; no default).  MUST be a
      local-part (see Section 3.4.1 of [MAIL]) specifying an e-mail
      address to which a report SHOULD be sent when mail claiming to be
      from this domain (see Section 2.4 of [SPF] for a description of
      how domains are identified for SPF checks) has failed the
      evaluation algorithm described in [SPF], in particular because a
      message arrived via an unauthorized route.  To generate a complete
      address to which the report is sent, the verifier simply appends
      to this value an "@" followed by the SPF-compliant domain per
      paragraph 4.1 of [SPF]. ra= modifiers in a record that was reached
      by following an include: mechanism MUST be ignored.

      ABNF:

      spf-report-tag = %x72.61 "=" qp-section

   rp=  Requested Report Percentage (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is
      "100").  The value is an integer from 0 to 100 inclusive that
      indicates what percentage of incidents of SPF failures, selected
      at random, are to cause reports to be generated.  The report
      generator SHOULD NOT issue reports for more than the requested
      percentage of incidents.  An exception to this might be some out-
      of-band arrangement between two parties to override it with some
      mutually agreed value.  Report generators MAY make use of the
      "Incidents:" field in [ARF] to indicate that there are more
      reportable incidents than there are reports.

      ABNF:

      spf-rp-tag = %x72.69 *WSP "=" *WSP 1*12DIGIT "/" 1*12DIGIT

Internet-Draft         SPF Auth Failure Reporting             March 2012


   rr=  Requested Reports (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "all").  The
      value MUST be a colon-separated list of tokens representing those
      conditions under which a report is desired.  See Section 4.1 for a
      list of valid tags.

      ABNF:

      spf-rr-type = ( "all" / "e" / "f" / "s" / "n" )

      spf-rr-tag = %x72.72 "=" spf-rr-type 0* ( ":" spf-rr-type )

   In the absence of an "ra=" tag in the SPF record, the "rp=" and "rr="
   tags MUST be ignored, and the report generator MUST NOT issue a
   report.

4.  Requested Reports

   This memo also includes, as the "rr" tokens defined above, the means
   by which the sender can request reports for specific circumstances of
   interest.  Verifiers MUST NOT generate reports for incidents that do
   not match a requested report, and MUST ignore requests for reports
   not included in this list.

4.1.  Requested Reports for SPF Failures

   The following report requests are defined for SPF results:

   all  All reports are requested.

   e  Reports are requested for messages that produced an SPF result of
      "TempError" or "PermError".

   f  Reports are requested for messages that produced an SPF result of
      "Fail".

   s  Reports are requested for messages that produced an SPF result of
      "SoftFail".

   n  Reports are requested for messages that produced an SPF result of
      "Neutral" or "None".

5.  IANA Considerations

   As required by [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS], this section contains registry
   information for the new [SPF] modifiers.

5.1.  SPF Modifier Registration

   IANA is requested to create the Sender Policy Framework Modifier
   Registry, to include a list of all registered SPF modifier names and
   their defining documents.

   New registrations or updates are to be published in accordance with
   the "Specification Required" guidelines as described in
   [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS].  New registrations and updates MUST contain
   the following information:

   1.  Name of the modifier being registered or updated

   2.  The document in which the specification of the modifier is
       published

   3.  New or updated status, which MUST be one of:

       current:  The field is in current use

       deprecated:  The field might be in current use but its use is
          discouraged

       historic:  The field is no longer in current use

   An update may make a notation on an existing registration indicating
   that a registered field is historic or deprecated if appropriate.

6.  Security Considerations

   Inherited considerations: implementors are advised to consider the
   Security Considerations sections of [SPF], [ARF], [I-D.IETF-MARF-AS],
   and [I-D.IETF-MARF-AUTHFAILURE-REPORT].

   In addition to the advice in the Security Considerations section of
   [I-D.IETF-MARF-AS], these additional considerations apply to
   generation of [SPF] authentication failure reports:

6.1.  Identity Selection

   Preventing an [SPF] failure for SPF SPF authentication failure
   reports is essential to mitigate the risk of data loops.

      If the [SMTP] return address to be used will not be the NULL
      return address, i.e., "MAIL FROM:<>", then the selected return
      address MUST be selected such that it will pass [SPF] MAIL FROM
      checks upon initial receipt.

      If the report is passed to the Mail Submission Agent (MSA) (MSA is
      described in [EMAIL-ARCH] using [SMTP], the HELO/EHLO command
      parameter SHOULD also be selected so that it will pass [SPF] HELO
      checks.

6.2.  Report Volume

   It is impossible to predict the volume of reports this facility will
   generate when enabled by a report receiver.  An implementer ought to
   anticipate substantial volume, since the amount of abuse occurring at
   receivers cannot be known ahead of time, and may vary rapidly and
   unpredictably.
