    <abstract>
      <t>The ability to compute shortest constrained Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains has been identified as a key requirement for point-to-point (P2P) and point-to-multipoint (P2MP) scenarios. Backward-Recursive Path Computation (BRPC) <xref target="RFC5441"/> defines Virtual Shortest Path Tree (VSPT) as a default de-facto data structure for path reply message in inter-domain scenarios. </t>
      <t>As Path Computation Element (PCE) will get used in newer scenarios like inter-domain, protection, P2MP etc. As well as PCE is being explored to be used in Cross Stratrum Optimization (CSO) environment (see <xref target="CSO-PCE"/>) as well as in <xref target="ABNO"/>. Limiting PCE communication Protocol (PCEP) to just one data structure limits the usage of PCEP. Its important to keep PCEP generic enough to use differnt data structure and apply different algorithms. </t>
      <t>This document defines extensions to the PCEP to allow multiple data structures.  Extensions are defined for PCE to indicate the set of Data Structure (DS) it supports; also Path Computation Client (PCC) or PCE can indicate in a path computation request the required DS, and a PCE can report in a path computation reply the Data Structure that was used in the path reply message.</t>

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>The PCE architecture is defined in <xref target="RFC4655"/>.  <xref target="RFC5441"/> describe a PCE-based path computation procedure to compute optimal inter-domain constrained (G)MPLS TE LSPs. It also defines Virtual Shortest Path Tree (VSPT) which is the only data structure and is used in all inter-domain scenarios. </t>
      <t>This document describes the need for multiple data structure (DS). It may be useful for a PCC/PCE to discover the set of Data Structure (DS) supported by a PCE. Furthermore, PCC/PCE requires the ability to indicate in a path computation request a required/desired Data Structure, as well as optional function parameters.  </t>
      <t>For these purposes, this document extends the PCE communication Protocol (PCEP). It defines PCEP extensions that allow a PCE to advertise a list of supported Data Structure (DS), as well as extensions to carry Data Structure (DS) in PCEP request and reply messages. It complements the PCEP base specification <xref target="RFC5440"/>.</t>
      <t>Note that OSPF and IS-IS-based PCE discovery mechanisms are defined in <xref target="RFC5088"/> and <xref target="RFC5089"/>. These mechanisms are dedicated to the discovery of a few generic parameters, while more detailed PCE parameters should be discovered using the PCE communication Protocol.</t>
      <t>Data Structure (DS) are in this second category; thus, the Data Structure discovery procedure is handled by PCEP.</t>
      <t>A new PCEP TLV, named the DS-List TLV, is defined in Section 4. The DS-List TLV is carried in the PCEP OPEN object and allows a PCE to list, during PCEP session-setup phase, the Data Structure (DS) that it supports.</t>
      <t>A new PCEP object, the DS object, is defined in Section 5. The DS object is carried within a PCReq (Path Computation Request) message to indicate the required/desired data structure to be applied by a PCE, or in a PCRep (Path Computation Reply) message to indicate the data structure that was used for path computation and the reply message. </t>

    <section title="Point to Multipoint (P2MP)" toc="default">  
          <t><xref target="PCE-P2MP-PROCEDURES"/> describes the need for an extended VSPT for computation of the best core-tree.  In case of Core tree based path computation, the PCE in a downstream domain does the pruning and returns the single optimal sub-path to its previous PCE, BRPC insures that the ingress PCE will get all the best optimal sub-paths for each LN (Leaf Border Nodes), but the combination of these single optimal sub-paths into a P2MP tree is not necessarily optimal even if each S2L (Source-to-Leaf) sub-path is optimal. Without trimming, the ingress PCE will get all the possible S2L sub-paths set for LN, and eventually by looking through all the combinations, and taking one sub-path from each set to built one P2MP tree it finds the optimal tree. </t>
    </section>      
    <section title="Synchronized Dependent Path Computations" toc="default">  
          <t><xref target="RFC6007"/> describes the need for disjoint VSPT in case of Synchronized Dependent Path Computations.</t>
          <t>The BRPC procedure constructs a VSPT to inform the enquiring PCE of potential paths to the destination node.</t>
          <t>In the end-to-end diverse path computation, diversity (or disjointness) information among the potential paths must be preserved in the VSPT to ensure an end-to-end disjoint path. In order to preserve diversity (or disjointness) information, disjoint VSPTs are sent in the PCEP PCRep message. The PCReq containing a SVEC object with the appropriate diverse flag set would signal that the PCE should compute a disjoint VSPT.</t>
          <t>A definition of the disjoint VSPT is a collection of VSPTs, in which each VSPT contains a potential set of primary and secondary paths.</t>

          <t>In Hierarchical PCE model (<xref target="RFC6805"/>), Parent PCE MAY be used to return the domain-sequence which may be further applied by the ingress PCE to do the BRPC path computation; or Parent PCE MAY do the full end to end path computation.</t>

          <t>Transit Domain(s): Entry Boundary Nodes to Exit Boundary Nodes</t>
          <t>Egress Domain: Entry Boundary Nodes to Egress</t>
          </list>
          </t>
          <t>Here the results are a list of best paths between the nodes listed above, is is not a VSPT, which clearly defines it self as a P2MP Tree from entry boundary nodes to egress. </t>
          <t>There exist clear instances like this where VSPT is not the only data structure in use.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Others" toc="default">            
          <t>VSPT does not work well with boundary constraints like HOP-LIMIT in inter-domain scenarios. Since there maybe a not-the-best-path in a domain which would have satisfied the end to end contraint, but was prunded.</t>
          <t>Since PCEP allow multiple Objective Function (OF) <xref target="RFC5541"/>; it is natural to extend PCEP to support multiple Data Structure based on path computation scenarios.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="PCE in future" toc="default">            
    <t><xref target="CSO-PCE"/> describes the use of PCE in Cross Stratrum Optimization (CSO) environment. A request can be made to the PCE with different sets of computation mode that are not currently supported by PCE.  For instance, NCG may request PCE a multi-destination and multi-source path computation request.  This scenario arises when there are many possible Data Center choices for a given application request and there could be multiple sources for this request.  Multi-destination with a single source (aka., anycast) is a default case for multi-destination and multi-source path computation.</t>
    <t>In addition, with this architecture, NCG may have different sets of objectives and constraints than typical path computation requests. For instance, multi-criteria objective functions that combine the bandwidth requirement and latency may be very useful for some applications. </t>
    <t><xref target="ABNO"/> describes Application-Based Network Operations using PCE.</t>
    <t>Its important to keep PCEP generic to support new requirements in the future.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Others Techniques" toc="default">            
    <t>This is being achieved in some extent by an RP object bit. </t>
    <t>For example, if P2MP bit is set and Objective function (OF) is Minimum Cost Tree (MCT), the extended VSPT should be used. We beleive this not a sustainable mechanism.</t>
    <t>Making PCEP generic allowing use of multiple DS will make PCEP protocol behave in a better way.</t>

      <t>This section defines PCEP extensions (see <xref target="RFC5440"/>) so as to support the advertisement of the Data Structure (DS) supported by a PCE. </t>

That is, the TLV is composed of 2 octets for the type, 2 octets specifying the TLV length, and a Value field. The Length field defines the length of the value portion in octets. The TLV is padded to 4-octet alignment, and padding is not included in the Length field (e.g., a 3-octet value would have a length of three, but the total size of the TLV would be eight octets).</t>

      <section title="New RP Object Flag" toc="default">
        <t>In some cases, where no data structure is specified in the request or an optional data structure is desired (P flag cleared in the DS object common header) but the PCE does not follow the request, the PCC/PCE may desire to know the data structure that was used by the PCE during path computation. To that end, a new flag is defined in the RP object, named the DS flag, allowing a PCC/PCE to request for the inclusion in the path computation reply of the data structure that was used by the PCE during path computation.</t>
        <t>The following new bit flag of the RP object is defined:
The Supply DS on response flag (bit number &lt;TBA&gt;). When set in a PCReq message, this indicates that the PCE MUST provide the applied data structure in the PCRep message. When set in a PCRep message, this indicates that the data structure that was used during path computation is included.
</t>
        <section title="Elements of Procedure" toc="default">
          <t>If the PCC/PCE wants to know the data structure used by the PCE during path computation for a given request, it sets the DS flag in the RP object.</t>
          <t>On receipt of a PCReq message with the DS flag in the RP object set, the PCE proceeds as follows:</t>
          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>If policy permits, it MUST include in the PCRep message a DS object indicating the data structure it used during path computation.</t>
              <t>If policy does not permit, it MUST send a PCErr message with the PCEP error code "policy-violation" (type 5) and a new error value, "data structure indication not allowed", which is defined in this document.</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>Note that a legacy PCE might not recognize the DS flag in the RP object. According to the definition of the Flags field for the RP object (Section 7.4.1 of <xref target="RFC5440"/>), the legacy PCE will ignore the unknown flag, resulting in it sending a PCRep that does not contain a DS object. In this case, the PCC/PCE&#x2019;s behavior is an implementation choice. It might:</t>
          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>Discard the PCRep because it really wanted the DS object returned.</t>
              <t>Accept the PCRep without the knowledge of the DS that was applied.</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>Note also that these procedures can give rise to the situation where a PCC/PCE receives a PCRep that contains a DS object with a data structure identifier that the PCC/PCE does not recognize. In this situation, the PCC/PCE behavior is dependent on implementation and configuration. The PCC/PCE could choose any of the following (or some other action):</t>
          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>Ignore the DS object and use the computed path.</t>
              <t>Add the data structure to its view of the PCE&#x2019;s repertoire for inclusion in future computation requests.</t>
              <t>Discard the PCRep (i.e., the computed path) and send a PCReq to another PCE.</t>
              <t>Discard the PCRep (i.e., the computed path) and send another PCReq to the same PCE explicitly requiring the use of some other data structure (i.e., by setting the P bit in the DS object).</t>

      <t>PCEP security mechanisms are described in <xref target="RFC5440"/> and are used to secure entire PCEP messages. Nothing in this document changes the message flows or introduces any new messages, so the security mechanisms set out in <xref target="RFC5440"/> continue to be applicable.</t>
      <t>This document introduces a single new object that may optionally be carried on PCEP messages and will be automatically secured using the mechanisms described in <xref target="RFC5440"/>.</t>
      <t>If a PCEP message is vulnerable to attack (for example, because the security mechanisms are not used), then the DS object could be used as part of an attack; however, it is likely that other objects will provide far more significant ways of attacking a PCE or PCC in this case.</t>

      <section title="Control of Function and Policy" toc="default">
        <t>It MUST be possible to configure the activation/deactivation of data structure discovery in PCEP. In addition to the parameters already listed in Section 8.1 of <xref target="RFC5440"/>, a PCEP implementation SHOULD allow configuring a list of authorized data structure on a PCE. This may apply to any session the PCEP speaker participates in, to a specific session with a given PCEP peer, or to a specific group of sessions with a specific group of PCEP peers. Note that it is not mandatory for an implementation to support all data structure defined. It MUST be possible to configure a default data structure used for path computation when a path request is received that requests to use an optional data structure.</t>
