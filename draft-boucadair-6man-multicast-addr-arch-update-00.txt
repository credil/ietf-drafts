Internet-Draft             Multicast Flag bits              January 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document updates the IPv6 multicast addressing architecture
   [RFC4291] by defining the 17-20 reserved bits as generic flag bits
   (Section 2).  The document provides also some clarifications related
   to the use of these flag bits (Section 3.1) and also about IANA
   assigned SSM blocks (Section 3.2).

   This document updates [RFC3956], [RFC3306], [RFC4607] and [RFC4291].


2.  Addressing Architecture Update

   Bits 17-20 of a multicast address are defined in [RFC3956] and
   [RFC3306] as reserved bits.  This document defines these bits as
   generic flag bits so that they apply to any multicast address.
   Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the updated structure of the addressing
   architecture.  The first diagram shows the update of the base IPv6
   addressing architecture, and the second shows the update of so-called
   Embedded-RP.

Internet-Draft             Multicast Flag bits              January 2013


   Further specification documents may define a meaning for these flag
   bits.  Defining the bits 17-20 as flags for all IPv6 multicast
   addresses allows addresses to be treated in a more uniform and
   generic way, and allows for these bits to be defined in the future
   for different purposes, irrespective of the specific type of
   multicast address.


3.  Clarifications

3.1.  Flag Bits

   Some implementations and specification documents do not treat the
   flag bits as separate bits but tend to use their combined value as a
   4-bit integer.  This practice is a hurdle for assigning a meaning to
   the remaining flag bits.  Below are listed some examples for
   illustration purposes:

   o  the reading of [RFC4607] may lead to conclude that ff3x::/32 is
      the only allowed SSM IPv6 prefix block.

   o  [RFC3956] states only ff70::/12 applies to Embedded-RP.
      Particularly, implementations should not treat the fff0::/12 range
      as Embedded-RP.

   To avoid such confusion and to unambiguously associate a meaning with
   the remaining flags, the following recommendation is made

      Implementations MUST treat flag bits as separate bits.

3.2.  IANA Assigned SSM Block

   Another issue related to SSM is the IANA assigned SSM address block.
   Per [RFC4607], ff3x::4000:0001 through ff3x::7fff:fff is the block
   for IANA assignments (http://www.iana.org/assignments/
   ipv6-multicast-addresses/ipv6-multicast-addresses.xml).  However,
   IANA assignments are permanent addresses and should not have the
   transient bit set.  Quoting from [RFC4607]:

      "T = 1 indicates a non-permanently-assigned ("transient")
      multicast address.".


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document may require IANA updates.  However, at this point it is
   not clear exactly what these updates may be.

5.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations discussed in [RFC3956], [RFC3306], [RFC4607]
   and [RFC4291] MUST be taken into account.
