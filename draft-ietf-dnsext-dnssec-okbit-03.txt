In order to deploy DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions)
operationally, DNSSEC aware servers should only perform automatic
inclusion of DNSSEC RRs when there is an explicit indication that the
resolver can understand those RRs.  This document proposes the use of
a bit in the EDNS0 header to provide that explicit indication and
describes the necessary protocol changes to implement that
notification. 

This document is a product of the DNS Extensions Working Group of the
IETF. 

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.
