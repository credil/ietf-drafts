1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG [RFC6020] data model for management of
   IP implementations.

   The initial version of this data model focuses on configuration
   parameters for interfaces.  Future revisions of this data model might
   add other kinds of IP parameters.

   Parameters to manage IP routing are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-routing-cfg].

1.1.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, [RFC2119].

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6241] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  client

   o  server

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6020] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  augment

   o  data model

   o  data node

2.  IP Data Model

   The module "ietf-ip" augments the "interface" list defined in the
   "ietf-interfaces" module [I-D.ietf-netmod-interfaces-cfg] with the
   following data nodes, where square brackets are used to enclose a
   list's keys, and "?" means that the node is optional.  Choice and
   case nodes are enclosed in parenthesis, and a case node is marked
   with a colon (":").

      +--rw if:interfaces
         +--rw if:interface [name]
            ...
            +--rw ipv4?
            |  +--rw enabled?            boolean

            |  |     |  +--rw ip:prefix-length?   uint8
            |  |     +--:(netmask)
            |  |        +--rw ip:netmask?         inet:ipv4-address

               +--rw enabled?            boolean
               +--rw forwarding?         boolean
               +--rw mtu?                uint32
               +--rw address [ip]
               |  +--rw ip               inet:ipv6-address
               |  +--rw prefix-length?   uint8
               +--rw neighbor [ip]
               |  +--rw ip               inet:ipv6-address
               |  +--rw phys-address?    yang:phys-address
               +--rw dup-addr-detect-transmits?   uint32
               +--rw autoconf
                  +--rw create-global-addresses?        boolean
                  +--rw create-temporary-addresses?     boolean
                  +--rw temporary-valid-lifetime?       uint32
                  +--rw temporary-preferred-lifetime?   uint32

   The data model defines two containers, "ipv4" and "ipv6",
   representing the IPv4 and IPv6 address families.  In each container,
   there is a leaf "enabled" that controls if the address family is
   enabled on that interface, and a leaf "forwarding" that controls if
   ip packet forwarding for the address family is enabled on the

   interface.  In each container, there is also a list of addresses, and
   a list of mappings from ip addresses to physical addresses.

Internet-Draft             YANG IP Management              February 2013


3.  Relationship to IP-MIB

   If the device implements IP-MIB [RFC4293], each entry in the "ipv4/
   address" and "ipv6/address" lists is mapped to one ipAddressEntry,
   where the ipAddressIfIndex refers to the "address" entry's interface.

   The IP-MIB defines objects to control IPv6 Router Advertisement.  The
   corresponding YANG data nodes are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-routing-cfg].

   The entries in "ipv4/neighbor" and "ipv6/neighbor" are mapped to
   ipNetToPhysicalTable.

   The object ipAddressStatus is writable in the IP-MIB but does not
   represent configuration, and is thus not mapped to the YANG module.

   The following table lists the YANG data nodes with corresponding
   objects in the IP-MIB.

          +-----------------+-----------------------------------+
          | YANG data node  | IP-MIB object                     |
          +-----------------+-----------------------------------+
          | ipv4/enabled    | ipv4InterfaceEnableStatus         |
          | ipv4/address    | ipAddressEntry                    |
          | ipv4/address/ip | ipAddressAddrType / ipAddressAddr |
          | ipv4/neighbor   | ipNetToPhysicalTable              |
          | ipv6/enabled    | ipv6InterfaceEnableStatus         |
          | ipv6/forwarding | ipv6InterfaceForwarding           |
          | ipv6/address    | ipAddressEntry                    |
          | ipv6/address/ip | ipAddressAddrType / ipAddressAddr |
          | ipv6/neighbor   | ipNetToPhysicalTable              |
          +-----------------+-----------------------------------+

               Mapping of YANG data nodes to IP-MIB objects

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a URI in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688].
   Following the format in RFC 3688, the following registration is
   requested to be made.

        URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-ip

        Registrant Contact: The NETMOD WG of the IETF.

        XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers a YANG module in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC6020].

     name:         ietf-ip
     namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-ip

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the
   secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is SSH [RFC6242].

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module which are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   ipv4/enabled and ipv6/enabled:  These leafs are used to enable or
      disable IPv4 and IPv6 on a specific interface.  By enabling a
      protocol on an interface, an attacker might be able to create an
      unsecured path into a node (or through it if routing is also
      enabled).  By disabling a protocol on an interface, an attacker
      might be able to force packets to be routed through some other
      interface or deny access to some or all of the network via that
      protocol.

   ipv4/address and ipv6/address:  These lists specify the configured IP
      addresses on an interface.  By modifying this information, an
      attacker can cause a node to either ignore messages destined to it
      or accept (at least at the IP layer) messages it would otherwise
      ignore.  The use of filtering or security associations may reduce
      the potential damage in the latter case.

   ipv4/forwarding and ipv6/forwarding:  These leafs allow a client to
      enable or disable the forwarding functions on the entity.  By
      disabling the forwarding functions, an attacker would possibly be
      able to deny service to users.  By enabling the forwarding
      functions, an attacker could open a conduit into an area.  This
      might result in the area providing transit for packets it
      shouldn't or might allow the attacker access to the area bypassing
      security safeguards.

   ipv6/autoconf:  The leafs in this branch control the
      autoconfiguration of IPv6 addresses and in particular whether
      temporary addresses are used or not.  By modifying the
      corresponding leafs, an attacker might impact the addresses used
      by a node and thus indirectly the privacy of the users using the
      node.

   ipv4/mtu and ipv6/mtu:  Setting these leafs to very small values can
      be used to slow down interfaces.
