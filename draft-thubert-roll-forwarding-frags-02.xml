	  <t>

		In order to be routed, a fragmented packet must be reassembled 
		at every hop of a multihop link where lower layer 
		fragmentation occurs.
 	    Considering that the IPv6 minimum MTU is 1280 bytes and
	    that an an 802.15.4 frame can have a payload limited to 74
	    bytes in the worst case, a packet might end up fragmented
	    into as many as 18 fragments at the 6LoWPAN shim layer.
	    If a single one of those fragments is lost in
	    transmission, all fragments must be resent, further
	    contributing to the congestion that might have caused the
	    initial packet loss. This draft introduces a simple
	    protocol to forward and recover individual fragments that might be
	    lost over multiple hops between 6LoWPAN endpoints.

	<section anchor='introduction' title="Introduction">

	  <t>
	    In most Low Power and Lossy Network (LLN) applications, 
		the bulk of the traffic consists of small chunks of data
		(in the order few bytes to a few tens of bytes) at a time. 
		Given that an 802.15.4 frame can carry 74 bytes or more in
		all cases, fragmentation is usually not required. However, 
		and though this happens only occasionally, a number of
		mission critical applications do require the capability to
		transfer larger chunks of data, for instance to support
		a firmware upgrades of the LLN nodes or an extraction
		of logs from LLN nodes. In the former case, the large chunk 
		of data is transferred to the LLN node, whereas in the 
		latter, the large chunk flows away from the LLN node. 
		In both cases, the size can be on the order of 10K bytes 
		or more and an end-to-end reliable transport is required.
	  </t>
	  
	  <t>
	    Mechanisms such as TCP or application-layer segmentation
	    will be used to support end-to-end reliable transport. One
	    option to support bulk data transfer over a frame-size-constrained
		LLN is to set the Maximum Segment Size to fit within the link
	    maximum frame size. Doing so, however, can add significant header
	    overhead to each 802.15.4 frame. 

<!-- Using TCP, for example,
	    would consume 20 bytes in each frame without header
	    compression - a significant fraction of the available
	    frame payload. Furthermore, 
--> 

This causes the end-to-end transport to be intimately aware of the delivery
properties of the underlaying LLN, which is a layer violation.

</t>

<!--
<t>
The
unreliable nature of wireless communication can decrease datagram
delivery rates and multipath forwarding often leads to out-of-order
delivery. As a result, relying completely on transport or
application-layer segmentation is inefficient in both bandwidth and
energy resources and must be adapted to the properties of 6LoWPAN
networks.
	  </t>
-->	  
	  <t>
	    An alternative mechanism combines the use of 6LoWPAN
	    fragmentation in addition to transport or
	    application-layer segmentation. Increasing the Maximum
	    Segment Size reduces header overhead by the end-to-end
	    transport protocol. It also encourages the transport
	    protocol to reduce the number of outstanding datagrams,
	    ideally to a single datagram, thus reducing the need to
	    support out-of-order delivery common to LLNs.
	  </t>
	  
	  <t>
	    <xref target="RFC4944"/> defines a datagram fragmentation
	    mechanism for LLNs. However, because
	    <xref target="RFC4944"/> does not define a mechanism for
	    recovering fragments that are lost, datagram forwarding
	    fails if even one fragment is not delivered properly to
	    the next IP hop. End-to-end transport mechanisms will
	    require retransmission of all fragments, wasting resources
	    in an already resource-constrained network.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	  	<!--
		Lessons about fragmentation were learnt with IPv4 that lead to <xref target="RFC1191"> the
		Path MTU discovery</xref>. 
		-->
		Past experience with fragmentation has shown that
		missassociated or lost fragments can lead to poor network behavior and,
		eventually, trouble at application layer. The reader is encouraged to read
		<xref target="RFC4963"/> and follow the references for more information. 
		That experience led to the definition of <xref target="RFC1191"> the
		Path MTU discovery</xref> protocol that limits fragmentation over the Internet. 
	  </t>
	  <t>
	  	<!--
		Because higher QoS packets might require access to the medium, or because an alternate path
		might be globally more efficient over the LoWPAN at a given point of time, 
		--> 
		For one-hop communications, a number of media propose a local acknowledgement mechanism that is enough to
		protect the fragments. In a multihop environment, an end-to-end fragment recovery mechanism might be a good complement to a 
		hop-by-hop MAC level recovery.
	    This draft introduces a simple protocol to recover individual fragments between 6LoWPAN endpoints.
		 Specifically in the case of UDP, valuable additional information can be found in

	<section anchor='rationale' title="Rationale">
	  <t>

	  There are a number of uses for large packets in Wireless Sensor Networks. Such usages
	  may not be the most typical or represent the largest amount of traffic over the LLN;
	  however, the associated functionality can be critical enough to justify extra care for 
	  ensuring effective transport of large packets across the LLN.
	  </t>
	  
	  <t>
	  The list of those usages includes:
          <list style='hanging'>
		  
	     <t hangText="Towards the LLN node:">
		 
          <list style='hanging'>
		  
	      <t hangText="Packages of Commands:">
	       A number of commands or a full configuration can by packaged as a single message
	       to ensure consistency and enable atomic execution or complete roll back. 
		   Until such commands are fully received and interpreted, the intended operation will not take effect.
	     </t>
	     <t hangText="Firmware update:">
	       For example, a new version of the LLN node software is downloaded from a system
		   manager over unicast or multicast services.
		   Such a reflashing operation typically involves updating a large number of similar
		   LLN nodes over a relatively short period of time.

        <list style='hanging'>
		  
	     <t hangText="Waveform captures:">
	       A number of consecutive samples are measured at a high rate for a short time and then transferred
		   from a sensor to a gateway or an edge server as a single large report.
	     </t>
	     <t hangText="Data logs:">
	       LLN nodes may generate large logs of sampled data

	       node or network.
	     </t>
	     <t hangText="Large data packets:">
	       Rich data types might require more than one fragment.		   
	     </t>
		</list>
		
	     </t>
		</list>
	  </t>
	  <t>
		   Uncontrolled firmware download or waveform upload can easily result in a massive 
		   increase of the traffic and saturate the network. 
		</t>
		<t>
		   When a fragment is lost in transmission, all fragments are resent, further contributing
	       to the congestion that caused the initial loss, and potentially leading to congestion collapse.
		   
	  </t>
	  <t>
		   This saturation may lead to excessive radio interference, or random early discard 
		   (leaky bucket) in relaying nodes. Additional queuing and memory congestion may
		   result while waiting for a low power next hop to emerge from its sleeping state.
		   
			   
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    To demonstrate the severity of the problem, consider a
	    fairly reliable 802.15.4 frame delivery rate of 99.9% over
	    a single 802.15.4 hop. The expected delivery rate of a
	    5-fragment datagram would be about 99.5% over a single
	    802.15.4 hop. However, the expected delivery rate would
	    drop to 95.1% over 10 hops, a reasonable network diameter
	    for LLN applications. The expected delivery rate for a
	    1280-byte datagram is 98.4% over a single hop and 85.2%
	    over 10 hops.
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    Considering that  <xref target="RFC4944"/> 
		defines an MTU is 1280 bytes and that in most incarnations
		(but 802.15.4G) a 802.15.4 frame can limit the MAC payload
		to as few as 74 bytes, a packet might be fragmented into at
	    least 18 fragments at the 6LoWPAN shim layer.  Taking into
	    account the worst-case header overhead for 6LoWPAN
	    Fragmentation and Mesh Addressing headers will increase
	    the number of required fragments to around 32.  This level
	    of fragmentation is much higher than that traditionally
	    experienced over the Internet with IPv4 fragments.  At the
	    same time, the use of radios increases the probability of
	    transmission loss and Mesh-Under techniques compound that
	    risk over multiple hops.
		<!--n the other hand, Layer
		2 retries alleviate the risk of packet loss but lead to less controlled overall latency, 
		monopolize a hop, and might not be as efficient as trying an alternate path entirely.-->
		
		
	  </t>

	<section anchor='req' title="Requirements">

	   <t>
	      This paper proposes a method to recover individual fragments between LLN endpoints. The
		  method is designed to fit the following requirements of a LLN (with or without a Mesh-Under 
		  routing protocol):
		  
	   <list style="hanging">
	   <t hangText="Number of fragments"></t>
	   
	   <t>The recovery mechanism must support highly fragmented packets, with a maximum of 32 fragments per packet.
	   </t>
	   <t hangText="Minimum acknowledgement overhead"></t>  
	   <t> Because the radio is half duplex, and because of silent time spent in the 
	   various medium access mechanisms, an acknowledgment consumes roughly as many resources as data fragment.  
	    </t><t>The recovery mechanism should be able to acknowledge multiple fragments in a single message and
		not require an acknowledgement at all if fragments are already protected at a lower layer.
		</t>
           
	   <t hangText="Controlled latency"></t>
	   
	   <t>The recovery mechanism must succeed or give up within the time boundary imposed by the recovery process 
	   of the Upper Layer Protocols. 
	   </t>
	   <t hangText="Support for out-of-order fragment delivery"></t>  
	   <t> A Mesh-Under load balancing mechanism such as the ISA100 Data Link Layer can introduce out-of-sequence packets.</t>
	   <t>The recovery mechanism must account for packets that appear lost but are actually only delayed over a different path.
	    </t>
           
	   <t hangText="Optional congestion control"></t>  
	   <t> The aggregation of multiple concurrent flows may lead to the saturation of the radio network and congestion collapse.

	    </list>
	    </t>
	</section>
	<section anchor='overview' title="Overview">	
	 
	<t>Considering that a multi-hop LLN can be a very sensitive environment
	due to the limited queuing capabilities of a
	large population of its nodes, this draft recommends a simple and
	conservative approach to congestion control, based on TCP congestion avoidance.
	</t>
	<t>	Congestion on the forward path is assumed in case of packet loss, and packet loss is assumed upon time out.
	</t>
	<t>	Congestion on the forward path can also be indicated by an Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) mechanism.
	Though whether and how ECN <xref target="RFC3168"/> is carried out over the LoWPAN is out of scope, 
	this draft provides a way for the destination endpoint to echo an ECN indication
	back to the source endpoint in an acknowledgment message as represented in
	<xref target='ackfig'/> in <xref target='ackfrag'/>.
	</t>
	<t>	From the standpoint of a source 6LoWPAN endpoint, an outstanding fragment is a fragment that was
	sent but for which no explicit acknowledgment was received yet. 
	This means that the fragment might be on the way, received but not yet acknowledged, 
	or the acknowledgment might be on the way back. It is also possible that either
	the fragment or the acknowledgment was lost on the way.
	</t>
	<t>Because a meshed LLN might deliver frames out of order, it is virtually
	impossible to differentiate these situations. In other words, from the sender standpoint,
	all outstanding fragments might still be in the network and contribute to its congestion.
	There is an assumption, though, that after a certain amount of time, a frame is either received
    or lost, so it is not causing congestion anymore. This amount of time can be estimated based on the round trip
	delay between the 6LoWPAN endpoints. The method detailed in <xref target="RFC2988"/> is recommended for that computation.
	</t>
	<t>The reader is encouraged to read through <xref target="RFC2914">"Congestion Control Principles"</xref>. 
	Additionally <xref target="RFC2309"/> and <xref target="RFC2581"/> provide deeper information on why this
	mechanism is needed and how TCP handles Congestion Control. Basically, the goal here is to
	manage the amount of fragments present in the network; this is achieved by to reducing the number of outstanding
	fragments over a congested path by throttling the sources.
	</t>
	<t> <xref target="ffc"/> describes how the sender decides how many fragments are (re)sent before
	an acknowledgment is required, and how the sender adapts that number to the network conditions.

    <section anchor="ffc" title="Fragments Recovery">
	
	<t>
	The  Recoverable Fragments header  RFRAG and RFRAG-AR deprecate the original
	fragment headers from <xref target="RFC4944"/> and replace them in the 
	fragmented packets. The Fragment Acknowledgement RFRAG-ACK is introduced 
	as a standalone header in message that is sent
	back to the fragment source endpoint as known by its MAC address. This 
	assumes that the source MAC address in the fragment (is any) and datagram_tag 
	are enough information to send the Fragment Acknowledgement back to the source
	fragmentation endpoint.
	
</t>
	<t>	The 6LoWPAN endpoint that fragments the packets at 6LoWPAN level (the sender) controls the  
	Fragment Acknowledgements. If may do that at any fragment to implement its own
	policy or perform congestion control which is out of scope for this document.
	When the sender of the fragment knows that an underlying mechanism protects the 
	Fragments already it MAY refrain from using the Acknowledgement mechanism, and
	never set the Ack Requested bit. The 6LoWPAN endpoint that recomposes the packets at 6LoWPAN 
	level (the receiver) MUST acknowledge the fragments it has received when asked
	to, and MAY slightly defer that acknowledgement.

	</t>


	
	<!--t>A mechanism based on TCP congestion avoidance dictates the maximum number of outstanding fragments.
	</t>

	<t>
	</t>

	<t>
	The maximum number of outstanding fragments for a given packet toward a given LoWPAN
	endpoint is initially set to a configured value, unless recent history indicates
	otherwise. 
	</t>	
	<t> Each time that maximum number of fragments is fully acknowledged, that
	number can be incremented by 1. ECN echo and packet loss cause the number to
	be divided by 2.
	</t-->	
	<t> 
	The sender transfers a controlled number of fragments and MAY flag the last
	fragment of a series with an acknowledgment request. The received MUST acknowledge a 
	fragment with the acknowledgment request bit set. If any fragment immediately preceding
	an acknowledgment request is still missing, the receiver MAY intentionally 
	delay its acknowledgment to allow in-transit fragments to arrive. delaying the acknowledgement
	might defeat the round trip delay computation so it should be configurable and not enabled 
	by default.
	</t>	
	<t>The receiver interacts with the sender using an Acknowledgment message with a bitmap that 
	indicates which fragments were actually received. 
	The bitmap is a 32bit SWORD, which accommodates up to 32 fragments and is sufficient for the 6LoWPAN MTU.
	For all n in [0..31], bit n is set to 1 in the bitmap to indicate that fragment with sequence n was received, 
	otherwise the bit is set to 0. All zeroes is a NULL bitmap that indicates that the fragmentation
	process was cancelled by the receiver for that datagram.
	</t>
	<t>The receiver MAY issue unsolicited acknowledgments. An unsolicited acknowledgment
	enables the sender endpoint to resume sending if it had reached its maximum number
	of outstanding fragments or indicate that the receiver has cancelled the process of an individual
	datagram. Note that acknowledgments might consume precious resources so the use of unsolicited
	acknowledgments should be configurable and not enabled by default.
	</t>
	<t> 
	The sender arms a retry timer to cover the fragment that carries the Acknowledgment request. 
	Upon time out, the sender assumes that all the fragments on the way are received or lost. 
	The process must have completed within an acceptable time that is within the boundaries of 
	upper layer retries. The method detailed in <xref target="RFC2988"/> is recommended for the 
	computation of the retry timer. It is expected that the upper layer retries obey the same or 
	friendly rules in which case a single round of fragment recovery should fit within the upper 
	layer recovery timers.
	</t>	
	<!--t> It divides the maximum number of 
	outstanding fragments by 2 and resets the number of outstanding fragments to 0. 
	</t-->

	<t>Fragments are sent in a round robin fashion: the sender sends all the fragments for a first time
	before it retries any lost fragment; lost fragments are retried in sequence, oldest first. 
	This mechanism enables the receiver to acknowledge fragments that were delayed in the network
	before they are actually retried.
	</t>
	
	<t>When the sender decides that a packet should be dropped and the fragmentation process canceled, it sends a 
	pseudo fragment with the datagram_offset, sequence and datagram_size all set to zero, and no data.
	Upon reception of this message, the receiver should clean up all resources for the packet
	associated to the datagram_tag. If an acknowledgement is requested, the receiver responds with a NULL bitmap.
	</t>
	<t>The receiver might need to cancel the process of a fragmented packet for internal reasons, for instance if
	it is out of recomposition buffers, or considers that this packet is already fully recomposed and passed
	to the upper layer. In that case, the receiver SHOULD indicate so to the sender with a NULL bitmap.
	Upon an acknowledgement with a NULL bitmap, the sender MUST drop the datagram.
	</t>

<section title="Forwarding Fragments">
		<t> This specification enables intermediate routers to forward fragments with no intermediate 
		reconstruction of the entire packet. Upon the first fragment, the routers lay an label along 
		the path that is followed by that fragment (that is IP routed), and all further fragments are 
		label switched along that path. As a consequence, alternate routes not possible for individual
		fragments. The datagram tag is used to carry the label, that is swapped at each hop.
		</t>

<section title="Upon the first fragment">
	<t>
	In route over the L2 source changes at each hop. The label that is formed adnd placed in the datagram tag is
	associated to the source MAC and only valid (and unique) for that source MAC. Say the first fragment has:
	<list>
		<t>Source IPv6 address = IP_A (maybe hops away) </t>
		<t>Destination IPv6 address = IP_B (maybe hops away) </t>
		<t>Source MAC = MAC_prv (prv as previous)</t>
		<t>Datagram_tag= DT_prv</t>
	</list>
	</t>
	<t>
    The intermediate router that forwards individual fragments does the following:
		<list>
		<t>a route lookup to get Next hop IPv6 towards IP_B, which resolves as IP_nxt (nxt as next)</t>
		<t>a ND resolution to get the MAC address associated to IP_nxt, which resolves as MAC_nxt</t>

	</list>
	</t>
	<t>Since it is a first fragment of a packet from that source MAC address MAC_prv for that tag DT_prv,
	the router:
		<list>
		<t>cleans up any leftover resource associated to the tupple (MAC_prv, DT_prv)</t>
		<t>allocates a new label for that flow, DT_nxt, from a Least Recently Used pool or
		some siumilar procedure.</t>
		<t>allocates a Label swap structure indexed by (MAC_prv, DT_prv) that contains
		(MAC_nxt, DT_nxt)</t>
		<t>allocates a Label swap structure indexed by (MAC_nxt, DT_nxt) that contains
		(MAC_prv, DT_prv)</t>
		<t>swaps the MAC info to from self to MAC_nxt </t>
		<t>Swaps the datagram_tag to DT_nxt</t>
	</list>
	At this point the router is all set and can forward the packet to nxt.
	</t>
	
	</section>
<section title="Upon the next fragments">
	<t>Upon next fragments (that are not first fragment), the router expects to have already
	Label swap structure indexed by (MAC_prv, DT_prv). The router:
	<list>
		<t>lookups up the Label swap entry for (MAC_prv, DT_prv), which resolves as (MAC_nxt, DT_nxt)</t>
		<t>swaps the MAC info to from self to MAC_nxt; </t>
		<t>Swaps the datagram_tag to DT_nxt</t>
	</list>
	At this point the router is all set and can forward the packet to nxt.
	</t>
	<t> if the Label swap entry for (MAC_src, DT_src) is not found, the router builds an RFRAG-ACK
	to indicate the error. The acknowledgment message has the following information:
	<list>
		<t>MAC info set to from self to MAC_prv as found in the fragment</t>
		<t>Swaps the datagram_tag set to DT_prv</t>
		<t>Bitmap of all zeroes to indicate the error</t>
	</list>
	At this point the router is all set and can send the RFRAG-ACK back ot the previous router.
	</t>

	</section>
<section title="Upon the fragment acknowledgements">

	<t>Upon fragment acknowledgements next fragments (that are not first fragment), the router expects to have already
	Label swap structure indexed by (MAC_nxt, DT_nxt). The router:
	<list>
		<t>lookups up the Label swap entry for (MAC_nxt, DT_nxt), which resolves as (MAC_prv, DT_prv)</t>
		<t>swaps the MAC info to from self to MAC_prv; </t>
		<t>Swaps the datagram_tag to DT_prv</t>
	</list>
	At this point the router is all set and can forward the RFRAG-ACK to prv.
	</t>
	
	<t> if the Label swap entry for (MAC_nxt, DT_nxt) is not found, it simply drops the packet.</t>
	
	<t> if the RFRAG-ACK indicates either an error or that the fragment was fully receive, the router schedules the
	 Label swap entries for recycling. If the RFRAG-ACK is lost on the way back, the source may retry the last fragments, 
	 which will result as an error RFRAG-ACK from the first router on the way that has already cleaned up.</t>
