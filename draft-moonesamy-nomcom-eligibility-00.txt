Internet-Draft             NomCom Eligibility              June 25, 2013


1  Introduction

   RFC 3777 [RFC3777] specifies the process by which members of the
   Internet Architecture Board (IAB), Internet Engineering Steering
   Group (IESG) and IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IOAC) are
   selected, confirmed, and recalled.  The Nominating Committee
   Selection is the process by which volunteers who will serve on the
   committee (NomCom) are recognized.

   The IETF Trust considers any submission to the IETF intended by the
   Contributor for publication as all or part of an Internet-Draft or
   RFC and any statement made within the context of an IETF activity
   [RFC5378].  Such statements include oral statements in IETF sessions
   as well as written and electronic communications, made through a
   Jabber room.  It is to be noted that the IETF decisions are made on
   its mailing lists.

   One of the rules for eligibility to serve on NomCom and to sign a
   Recall petition is that a person must have attended at least three of
   the last five IETF meetings.  There is an assumption that a person
   cannot understand how the IETF works if he or she does not have the
   financial means to attend three out of five meetings.  A person
   contributing to the IETF through electronic communications does not
   have any say about IAB, IESG or IAOC even though the IETF consider
   the person as as a contributor.  People are encouraged to participate
   and contribute through mailing lists but are completely
   disenfranchised relative to other people who attend IETF meetings. 
   People from remote parts of the world who lack extensive travel
   resources cannot participate to the maximum extent possible even if
   they are willing to invest the energy to do so.

   This document updates RFC 3777 [RFC3777] to to allow all contributors
   to the IETF Standards Process to be eligible to serve on NomCom and
   sign a Recall petition.

2.  Updated Text from RFC 3777

   RFC 3777 [RFC3777], Section 5, "Nominating Committee Operation",
   Paragraph 1 of Rule 14, is replaced as follows:

      Members of the IETF community must have attended at least 3 of
      last 5 IETF meetings remotely or in person including at least 1 of
      the 5 last IETF meetings in person in order to volunteer.

3  Security Considerations

      The document makes changes to the IETF process.  These changes
      will not affect the security of the Internet.

      The IETF community depends on the honor and integrity of the
      participants to make the process work.  This document encourages
      contributors not to cause any perception they are "gaming" the
      system.

4  IANA Considerations

      This document does not require IANA to take any action.
