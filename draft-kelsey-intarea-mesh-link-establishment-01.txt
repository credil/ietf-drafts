Abstract

   This document defines the mesh link establishment (MLE) protocol for
   establishing and configuring links in an ad hoc mesh radio network.
   Effective mesh networking using radio links requires identifying,
   configuring, and securing usable links to neighboring devices.  In an
   ad hoc mesh network a device's neighbors may come and go as the
   network's membership and physical environment change.  Newly usable
   links need to be identified and configured automatically, where
   configuration values can include link-layer addresses, transmit and
   receive modes, security parameters, and so forth.  MLE includes the
   option of securing the configuration messages themselves, as link-
   layer security may not be available prior to configuration.

1.  Introduction

   The configuration of individual links in an ad hoc mesh network can
   fall into a gap between standards.  Link layer standards typically
   deal with individual links and networking standards assume that the
   links are up and running.  In an ad hoc mesh network a device's
   neighbors may come and go as the network's membership and physical
   environment change, requiring that new links be configured
   automatically.  The required configuration information can include
   link layer addressing, transmit and receive modes, wake/sleep cycles,
   and so on.  Security configuration is particularly important, as the
   link layer may not be able to secure packets until after the link
   itself has been configured.

   MLE can be used to configure individual links and to distribute
   configuration values that are shared across a network.  MLE messages
   are sent using UDP.  Per-link configuration uses one-hop messages
   with link-local addresses.  Network-wide configuration uses
   multicasts and requires some form of multi-hop multicast forwarding.

   Link parameters can be unicast between two neighboring nodes, as when
   configuring a particular link, or multicast to all neighbors, in
   order to advertise to new neighbors or to efficiently transmit
   updated values.

   One of the most important properties of a radio link, how well the
   two neighbors hear each other, often cannot be determined
   unilaterally by either node.  Many radio links are asymmetric, where
   messages traveling one way across the link are received more or less
   reliably than messages traveling in the opposite direction.  There is
   a chicken and egg problem here.  It is a waste of effort to configure
   a link that does not have sufficient two-way reliability to be
   useful, but the two-way reliability cannot be determined without
   exchanging messages over the link.  MLE resolves this by allowing a
   node to periodically multicast an estimate of the quality of its
   links.  This allows a node to determine if it has a usable radio link
   to a neighbor without first configuring that link.

2.  Terminology

   ETX                 Expected Transmission Count; the number of
                       transmission attempts required to send a packet
                       over a particular link.  Defined to be the
                       product of the IDR values for both directions.  A
                       perfect link has an ETX of 1, less than perfect
                       links have higher ETX values.

   Frame counter       A value that is incremented with each new secured
                       message.  Used with [CCM] to ensure that no two
                       messages are secured using the same key and nonce
                       pair.  In 802.15.4 the same counter is used as
                       both a frame counter and a replay counter.

   Global configuration  Configuration values and messages that apply
                       across a network.  Global configuration message
                       are multicast messages forwarded across multiple
                       hops.

   IDR                 Inverse Delivery Ration; the number of
                       transmission attempts divided by the number of
                       successful transmissions in a given direction
                       over a link.

   Local configuration Configuration values and messages that apply only
                       to a single hop.  Local configuration message are
                       sent using link-local messages and are not
                       forwarded.

   Replay counter      A message value that is incremented with each new
                       transmission.  Incoming messages whose counter
                       value is the same or lower as that in an earlier
                       message are discarded.

3.  Overview

   MLE is a means of transmitting link configuration values.  An MLE
   message is one of:

   Link configuration  A one-hop unicast sent as part of establishing a
                       link with one particular neighbor.

   Advertisement       A one-hop multicast that advertise a node's link
                       quality estimates to its neighbors.

   Update              A network-wide multicast that updates a shared
                       configuration value.

   If negotiation is required, establishment of a link may require an
   exchange of two or more unicast messages.  The only multiple-message
   exchange in the MLE protocol performs liveness determination (replay
   counter initialization).

4.  Message Formats

   MLE messages consist of a command and a series of type-length-value
   parameters.  Unicast and advertisement messages, but not updates, can
   be secured using Advanced Encryption Standard 128 [AES] in Counter
   with CBC-MAC Mode [CCM] for data authentication and encryption.
   Updates are only sent over already-configured links and are assumed
   to be secured using normal link-layer security

   The security data is formatted as an auxiliary security header as
   specified in [IEEE802154].  There are two exceptions to this: a
   security header with security level of 0 does not contain a frame
   counter, and when frame counters are included they are in big-endian
   form.  This first exception avoids the need to include a frame
   counter when security is being provided by the link layer.  The
   second is to conform with normal IETF practice.  Otherwise, the
   presence and length of the frame counter, key identifier, and MIC
   follow [IEEE802154].

   If MLE security is in use each device MUST maintain an outgoing
   frame/replay counter for use in securing outgoing packets in
   compliance with [CCM].  MLE does not include a method for configuring
   its own frame counters and so does not provide complete protection
   against replayed MLE packets.

   MLE security MUST NOT use any key that is being used by the link (or
   any other) layer MLE security MAY use a key derived using a
   cryptographic hash from a key being used at the link layer.  Other
   than the above requirements, the distribution or derivation of the
   key(s) used for MLE security is outside the scope of this document.

                <message> := <security-data>
                             <command-id>
                             <tlv>*

                <security-data> := <security-control-field>
                                   <frame-counter>?
                                   <key-identifier>?


   The defined command IDs are:

5.  Values

   Values are encoded using a type-length-value format, where the type
   and length are one byte each and the length field contains the length
   of the value in bytes.  There are no alignment requirements and no
   padding.

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Length              Length of the Address field in octets.

   Source Address      A link-layer address assigned to the source of
                       the message.

   A given radio interface may have multiple link-layer addresses.  This
   TLV is used to communicate any source address(es) that is not
   included in the message by the link layer itself.

   Mode                Mode configuration of this link.  The possible
                       values are specific to the link layer in use.

   Mode information can include such things as the senders listening
   schedule, whether it will poll for messages, and so forth.

5.3.  Timeout

   Timeout             The expected maximum interval between
                       transmissions by the sender in seconds.

   This allows the receiver to more accurately timeout a link to a
   neighbor that polls for its incoming messages.

5.4.  Challenge


      0                   1                   2                   3

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Length              Length of the Challenge field in octets.

   Challenge           A random value used to determine the freshness of
                       any reply to this message.

   An important part of replay protection is determining if a newly-
   heard neighbor is actually present or is a set of recorded messages.
   This is done by sending a random challenge value to the neighbor and
   then receiving that same value in a Response TLV sent by the
   neighbor.

                       an "established" flag, the estimated incoming
                       link reliability (IDR), and the neighbor's link-
                       layer address.

   I(ncoming)          Set if the sender has configured its link with
                       this neighbor and will accept incoming messages
                       from them.

   O(utgoing)          Set if the sender believes that the neighbor has
                       configured its link with the sender and will
                       accept incoming messages from the sender.  This
                       flag is set if the sender has sent a Link Accept
                       message to the neighbor and cleared if the sender
                       has subsequently received a Link Quality TLV from
                       the neighbor with the sender's I flag cleared.

   Incoming IDR        The estimated inverse delivery ratio of messages
                       sent by the neighbor to the source of this
                       message.  To allow for fractional IDR, the value
                       encoded is multiplied by 32.  A perfect link,
                       with an actual IDR of 1, would have an Incoming
                       IDR of 0x20.  A value of 0xFF indicates that the
                       link is unusable.

   Address             A link-layer address of a neighbor.

   The I and O flags are used to facilitate the two-way use of links
   between neighboring routers.  They are advisory only; a node may send
   a message to a neighbor regardless of the state of the most recently
   seen corresponding I bit from that neighbor.  Similarly, a node may

   unilaterally discard a configured link without informing the neighbor
   of its intention.

   A node that does not have a link configured to a neighbor but
   receives a Link Quality TLV from that neighbor with the node's O flag
   set SHOULD send an MLE message with a Link Quality TLV with that
   neighbor's I bit cleared.  This message may either be a regular
   multicast Advertisement or a unicast to that neighbor containing only
   a single Neighbor Data record.

6.  Message transmission

   Messages SHOULD be sent using UDP port XXXX (value to be assigned by
   IANA).  Update messages SHOULD be sent to the site-local all-routers
   multicast address (FF05::2).  Link configuration and advertisement
   messages MUST be sent with an IP Hop Limit of 255.

   Outgoing link configuration and advertisements messages SHOULD be
   secured using the procedure specified in [AES] and [CCM] using the
   auxiliary security header as described in [IEEE802154].  Key choice
   is outside the scope of this document.  The authenticated data
   consists of the following three values concatenated together:

                          IP source address
                          IP destination address
                          auxiliary security header


   The secured data consists of the messages body following the
   auxiliary security header (the command ID and TLVs).

   A message sent in response to a multicast request, such as a
   multicast Link Request, MUST be delayed by a random time between 0
   and MAX_RESPONSE_DELAY_TIME seconds.

   MAX_RESPONSE_DELAY_TIME  1 second

   If no response is received to a request, the request MAY be
   retransmitted.  Because MLE messages do not require complex
   processing and are not relayed, a simple timeout scheme is used for
   retransmitting.  This is based on the retransmission mechanism used
   in DHCPv6 RFC 3315 [RFC3315], simplified to use a single, fixed
   timeout.



      Parameter       Default   Description
      -------------------------------------------------------
      URT               1 sec   Unicast Retransmission timeout.
      MRT               5 sec   Multicast Retransmission timeout.
      MRC               3       Maximum retransmission count.


   For each transmission the appropriate URT or MRT value is multiplied
   by a random number chosen with a uniform distribution between 0.9 and
   1.1.  The randomization factor is included to minimize
   synchronization of messages transmitted.

7.  Processing of incoming messages

   Any incoming link configuration or advertisement message whose IP Hop
   Limit is not 255 may have been forwarded by a router and MUST be
   discarded.

   Incoming update messages that contain TLVs other than Param TLVs
   SHOULD be ignored.

   Unsecured incoming link configuration and advertisement messages
   SHOULD be ignored.  Secured incoming messages are decrypted and
   authenticated using the procedures specified in [AES] and [CCM], with
   security material obtained from the auxiliary security header as
   described in [IEEE802154].  The key source may be obtained either
   from the link layer source address or from the auxiliary security
   header.

   A device SHOULD maintain a separate incoming frame/replay counter for
   each neighbor.  Any message received with a frame/replay counter the
   same or lower than that of a previously received and authenticated
   message from the same source MUST be discarded.  Messages for which
   no previous frame/replay counter are available are not discarded and
   the counter value SHOULD be saved for comparison with later messages.

8.  Application to 802.15.4

   This section describes how MLE could be used in an 802.15.4-based
   LoWPAN.  This section is not normative.  The values that may need to
   be communicated to configure an 802.15.4 include:

   o  Long (64-bit) and short (16-bit) addresses.

   o  Capability data byte, especially the Device Type and Receiver On
      When Idle fields.

   o  Initialization of AES-CCM frame counters (which are also used as
      replay counters).

   A device wishing to establish a link to a neighbor would send a Link
   Request message containing the following:

   o  Source Address TLV, containing the sender's short (16-bit) MAC
      address.  It is assumed that the sender's long (64-bit) MAC
      address is used as the MAC source address of the message.

   o  Mode TLV, containing the sender's Capability data byte.

   o  Timeout TLV, if the sender is an rxOffWhenIdle device.

   o  Challenge TLV, whose size is determined by the network
      configuration.

   If the neighbor has sufficient resources to maintain an additional
   link, it would respond with a Link Accept message containing the same
   TLVs (with its own values), but with a Response TLV in place of the
   Challenge TLV and with an added Replay Counter TLV.  If the neighbor
   also required a liveness check, it would include its own challenge,
   and use the Link Accept And Request message type.

   If a node receives a secured 802.15.4 unicast from a neighbor for
   whom it does not have link configuration data, the receiving node
   should respond with a Link Reject message to inform the neighbor that
   the link is not configured.

   Nodes could also send out periodic advertisements containing the
   incoming and outgoing ETX values for their neighbors.  These would be
   used to choose likely candidates for link establishment and to
   determine if existing links continued to provide sufficient two-way
   reliability.

   Because link configuration and advertisement messages are used to
   establish 802.15.4 security they should not be secured at the

   802.15.4 layer.

   Update messages may be sent to change the channel, PAN ID, and/or
   permit joining flags on all nodes.  The permit joining flag normally
   defaults to false; to avoid permanently enabling joining, the value
   of permit joining parameter should be the number of seconds for which
   the permit joining flag should be turned on, and not just true or
   false.

11.  Security Considerations

   IN PROGRESS

   Some MLE messages are necessarily sent unsecured.  Implementations
   must take care to use information data from unsecured messages
   appropriately.  In particular, information from unsecured messages
   should not be used to modify any stored information obtained from
   secured messages.
