1.  Introduction

   AFS-3 provides a service (the "Volume Service") [AFS3-VVL] which
   allows administrators to examine and manage AFS-3 volumes via several
   RX remote procedure calls in the AFSVol package.  One of these RPCs,
   Dump, can be used to obtain a dump of an AFS-3 volume that can be
   stored on disk, usually for backup or archival purposes.  Another
   RPC, DumpV2, was later added to allow the caller to make slight
   modifications to what data is contained in the dump by way of
   specifying certain flags in an additional argument.

   Another RPC, GetSize, can be used to obtain what the size of a dump
   obtained with Dump would be without needing to actually retrieve the
   full dump.  However, no analogous RPC exists to determine what the
   size of a volume dump obtained via DumpV2 would be if any flags were
   specified in the DumpV2 call.


2.  Error Codes

   The existing VOLSERBAD_ACCESS, VOLSERTRELE_ERROR, and ENOENT error
   codes are used by the new RPC defined within this document.


3.  RPC Interface

   One new RPC is defined for the Volume Service: GetSizeV2.
   Additionally, a new namespace for GetSizeV2 flags is defined, and one
   flag in that namespace is defined.

3.1.  GetSizeV2

   This behaves exactly the same way as the existing GetSize RPC, except
   for the addition of the flags argument, which behaves similarly to
   the flags argument of the existing DumpV2 RPC.

       GetSizeV2(IN afs_int32 fromTrans, IN afs_int32 fromDate,
                 IN afs_int32 flags, OUT struct volintSize *size) = XXX;

   The fromTrans parameter is a transaction ID as returned by the RPC
   TransCreate.  The size calculated will be the size of an incremental
   dump containing volume changes made after the specified calendar time
   fromDate, specified as the number of seconds since the Unix Epoch.
   If the specified fromDate is 0, the size for a full volume dump will
   be reported.

   The flags parameter is zero or more flags combined via a bitwise OR
   operation.  The available flags are described below in Section 3.2.

   The calculated dump size will be returned in the size parameter,
   represented in bytes.

   On success, the call returns 0.  If the calling user does not have
   sufficient permission, VOLSERBAD_ACCESS is returned.  If the
   specified transaction does not exist, ENOENT is returned.  If there
   is an error releasing the volume transaction, VOLSERTRELE_ERROR is
   returned.

3.2.  GetSizeV2 Flags

   The defined flags for GetSizeV2 are analogous to the flags in DumpV2,
   although all future flags defined for GetSizeV2 need not have
   equivalents in DumpV2 and vice versa.  As such, since there is only
   one flag currently defined for DumpV2 (VOLDUMPV2_OMITDIRS), there is
   only one flag defined for GetSizeV2:

   VOLGETSIZEV2_OMITDIRS = XXX

      This is the GetSizeV2 analogue of the DumpV2 flag
      VOLDUMPV2_OMITDIRS.  If this flag is set, the volume dump size
      will be calculated for a dump generated by a DumpV2 call where the
      flag VOLDUMPV2_OMITDIRS was set.  Such a dump does not include
      directory information for the parent directories of any modified
      directory entries, if the modification time for the parent
      directories are earlier than the specified fromDate.


4.  Security Considerations

   Current AFS-3 implementations only allow users listed in the server's
   AFS-3 Basic OverSeer's UserList to issue Dump, DumpV2, and GetSize
   RPCs successfully.  It is recommended that implementations also only
   allow such users to issue the GetSizeV2 RPC for consistency and to
   reduce potential Denial of Service attack vectors from
   unauthenticated clients.

   Additionally, while the size of a volume is not sensitive (and may be
   obtained from other RPCs from an unauthenticated user, such as
   XListVolumes), information on when a volume's contents have changed
   might be considered sensitive under some circumstances.  And since
   the GetSize and GetSizeV2 RPCs are generally only useful to members
   of the UserList, it makes little sense to allow any other users to
   call them.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of the IANA.


6.  AFS-3 Registry Considerations

   This document requires the registration of one code point for the
   AFSVol GetSizeV2 RPC detailed above.

   This document also requests that the AFS-3 Registrar assumes control
   over the GetSizeV2 flags namespace.  This document requires the
   registration of one flag in this namespace, AFSVOLGETSIZEV2_OMITDIRS,
   detailed above.
