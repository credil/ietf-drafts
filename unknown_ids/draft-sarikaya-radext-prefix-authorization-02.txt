Internet-Draft         RADIUS Prefix Authorization            March 2009


Abstract

   This document specifies a new attribute for supporting prefix
   authorization.  Using RADIUS protocol, a client requests prefixes
   from a server; the client gives back the prefixes to the server; the
   client is responsible for renewing the prefixes when the lifetime
   expires.  The RADIUS server can also renumber prefixes.  RADIUS
   clients can be home agents in MIPv6 and NEMO scenario, local mobile
   anchors in Proxy MIPv6 scenario, or common access routers.

Internet-Draft         RADIUS Prefix Authorization            March 2009


1.  Introduction

   Prefix assignment for an IPv6 node (host or router) is essential to
   IPv6 address formulation.  Even though IPv6 address space is large
   enough, it still makes sense for operators to manage addresses in a
   central way, e.g. using central DHCPv6 servers or AAA servers.
   Authorizing the use of a prefix that a central server has by a prefix
   user needs communication between different network entities.

   [RFC4968] provides different IPv6 link models that are suitable for
   802.16e [802.16e] based networks and provides analysis of various
   considerations for each link model and the applicability of each link
   model under different deployment scenarios.  As to IPv6 addressing,
   there are two models, shared link model and point-to-point link
   model.  In the former model, an IPv6 prefix is shared by multiple
   MNs.  While in the latter model, a prefix is only assigned to one MN.
   Different MNs can't share a prefix, and an MN can have multiple
   prefixes.  [RFC5121] specifies the addressing and operation of IPv6
   over the IPv6 specific part of the packet convergence sub-layer of
   IEEE Std 802.16e [802.16e], and point-to-point link model is
   recommended.  Also, 3GPP and 3GPP2 have earlier adopted the point-to-
   point link model [RFC3314].

   When an MN attaches an Access Router(AR), the AR requests one or more
   prefixes for the MN.  When the MN detaches the AR, the prefixes
   should be released.  When an operator wants to renumber its network,
   prefixes with different lifetimes are advertised to the MN.  Using
   the mechanism defined in this document, AR can offload prefix
   management to a dedicated server.  The prefix management method
   defined in this document is applicable to this scenario.

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol enables mobility support to a host without
   requiring its participation in any mobility related signaling
   [RFC5213].  Point-to-point access link is supported.  It assumes that
   the mobile node and the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) are the only two
   nodes on the access link.  Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement are used by Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) to allocate
   the prefixes for the mobile node to MAG.  How LMA gets these prefixes
   from external servers is out the scope of PMIPv6 protocol.  The
   prefix management method defined here is also applicable to this
   scenario.

   [RFC3633] defines Prefix Delegation options to provide a mechanism
   for automated delegation of IPv6 prefixes using the Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol (DHCP).  [I-D.ietf-nemo-dhcpv6-pd] describes
   how DHCPv6 PD can be used by mobile routers and home agents in
   network mobility.

Internet-Draft         RADIUS Prefix Authorization            March 2009


   In DHCPv6 PD, the delegating router can receive the prefixes from AAA
   server and Delegated-IPv6-Prefix RADIUS attribute was defined for
   this purpose [RFC4818].  In this case AAA server passively delegates
   the prefixes to the delegating router and it does not have any
   control over these prefixes in cases such as renumbering.  This
   document describes how prefix authorization can be achieved using
   RADIUS [RFC2865] and [I-D.ietf-radext-design].  The message exchanges
   described in this document will enable full prefix authorization
   functionality to the AAA servers.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Authorized Prefixes:  A collection of prefixes assigned to AAA
      client.  Each has an associated User Identity.  This concept is
      captured in pairs of Framed-Interface-Id and IPv6-Prefix-
      Information attributes defined in [RFC3162] and
      [I-D.lourdelet-radext-ipv6-access], respectively.  An AAA client
      may have more than one authorized prefix assigned to it; for
      example, one for each of access user's interface.  Also each
      interface may be assigned more than one prefixes.
   User identifier:  An identifier chosen by the client.  Each user has
      an user identifier, which is chosen to be unique among all user
      identifiers for users belonging to that client.  This concept is
      captured in Framed-Interface-Id attribute defined in [RFC3162].
   Aggregate Prefix:  In Point-to-Point Link Model, AR should broadcast
      the prefixes (MNs route information) dynamically upstream, and
      this causes high routing protocol traffic (OSPF, etc.).  To solve
      the problem, route aggregation should be used.  For example, each
      AR can be assigned a /48 prefix, while an MN's /64 prefix is
      derived from the /48 prefix extension.  The main, higher-level
      prefix is called the Aggregate Prefix.  An AR only broadcasts the
      aggregate prefix upstream.  Aggregate prefix is a pool of
      dedicated prefixes.
   Dedicated Prefix:  A unique prefix used by MN in Point-to-Point Link
      Model.  A dedicated prefix belongs to an aggregate prefix.
      Dedicated prefix information never be broadcasted by routing
      protocol.  In this memo, AAA client requests dedicated prefix
      along with the corresponding aggregate prefix from AAA server.
      Using the corresponding aggregate prefix information, AAA client
      broadcasts upstream MN's route information.

Internet-Draft         RADIUS Prefix Authorization            March 2009


   Prefix Authorization Client (PA Client):  RADIUS Client which is
      responsible for exchange with a RADIUS Server to fulfill prefix
      request, release, renew and reconfiguration functions.  In this
      document, it can be a HA for allocating prefix for mobile router,
      or a local mobility anchor (LMA) in Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6)
      scenario for managing dedicated prefix of MN, or an access router
      in point-to-point link model.
   Prefix Authorization Server (PA Server):  RADIUS Server which is
      responsible for exchange with a RADIUS Client to fulfill prefix
      request, release, renew and reconfiguration functions.  In this
      document, it can be collocated with a RADIUS authentication
      server, or it can be a separated server managing prefixes.
   Prefix Authorization User (PA User):  The end user of prefixes.  In
      this document, it can be MN which configures it's prefixes from
      LMA in PMIPv6 scenario, or a mobile router, or MN which requests
      it's prefix in a visited network.


3.  Prefix Authorization Usage Scenarios

   Prefix authorization can be used in Simple IP, Mobile IP, Proxy
   Mobile IP and Network Mobility (NEMO) use cases.

   In Simple IP use case the user is not provided any mobility support,
   i.e. the sessions will not survive when the user changes its IP
   connectivity.  Such a user MAY use stateless address configuration or
   address assignment may be carried over during network entry.

   If stateless address configuration is used, the access router MAY use
   prefix authorization defined in this document to get prefix(es)
   authorized for the user and then use router advertisements to
   advertise the prefix(es).  This has to be done specifically for each
   user because of the point-to-point link model used on links such as
   IEEE 802.16e [RFC5121].

   During network entry, the access router and AAA server communicate to
   authenticate the user. if authentication is successful, AR and AAA
   MAY use prefix authorization defined in this document to get
   prefix(es) authorized for the user.  If stateful address
   configuration is used DHCP server assigns an address from the
   authorized prefix(es) to the user.

   In Mobile IP use case the user is a Mobile IP client.  Mobile IP
   client or Mobile Node (MN) first gets a home address assigned by the
   Mobile IPv6 Home Agent (HA).  The recommended procedure is to use
   IKEv2 exchange.  Mobile Node includes the MIP6_HOME_PREFIX attribute
   in IKEv2 CFG_REQUEST message.  Home agent MAY use prefix
   authorization defined in this document to get prefix(es) authorized

Internet-Draft         RADIUS Prefix Authorization            March 2009


   for MN.  The Home Agent, when it processes this message, MUST include
   in the CFG_REPLY payload prefix information for one prefix on the
   home link [RFC5026].  This represents another use case for prefix
   authorization defined in this document by the home agent to get
   prefix(es) authorized for the user.

   In Proxy Mobile IP, when the user enters the network, Mobile Access
   Gateway (MAG) sends a Proxy Binding Update message to Local Mobility
   Anchor (LMA) to request prefix(es) to be assigned for the user.  LMA
   using prefix authorization defined in this document gets prefix(es)
   authorized for the user and returns prefix(es) in Proxy Binding
   Update message to MAG.  MAG advertizes the prefixes on the link and
   MN creates a home address.

   In network mobility, the mobile router (MR) needs to assign mobile
   network prefix(es) to the local nodes in the mobile network.  MR gets
   the mobile network prefix(es) from the home agent.  This represents
   another use case for prefix authorization defined in this document by
   the home agent to get prefix(es) authorized for the local user in the
   mobile network.

   In network mobility, there is another use case.  MR is a Mobile IP
   client and needs to get a home address.  This case is already
   described above in Mobile IP use case.

   The use of EAP and the existence of the RADIUS support for EAP
   [RFC3579] has made the RADIUS community to separate the act of
   authentication from authorization, and in this case, prefix
   management is a type of authorization.  This way, the peer (MN) and
   AAA client first run an EAP method with the AAA server using RADIUS
   support for EAP, followed by a service authorization process for
   prefixes.  To explicitly authorize the prefixes, in this document, we
   define RADIUS support.  RADIUS messages defined in [RFC2865] and in
   [RFC5176] are used.

4.1.  Prefix Request

   A PA Client sends an Access-Request message containing identity of
   the user to a PA server for prefix request.  The client is identified
   using Framed-Interface-Id defined in [RFC3162].  Access-Request
   message MUST contain Authorized-UserID-Prefix attribute.  The client
   MAY request an aggregate prefix, and then MAY subnet the prefix to
   the users.  It is also possible that the client only requests a
   dedicated prefix.  The PA server allocates one or more prefixes for
   the client using Access-Accept.  Lifetime of prefixes is included in
   Valid Lifetime field of IPv6-Prefix-Information in this message.  The
   lifetime value included is the value proposed by PA Client.

   Access-Request MUST contain Prefix-Authorization type attribute.  The
   value MUST be set to Request.

   PA Server replies with Access-Accept to PA Client.  PA server MUST
   include pairs of IPv6-Prefix-Information and Framed-Interface-Id
   attributes in Access-Accept.  The server authorizes prefixes included
   in IPv6-Prefix-Information to PA Client.  The prefixes can be used
   during Valid Lifetime period.

   Access-Accept MUST contain Prefix-Authorization type attribute.  The
   value MUST be set to Request.

   PA Server replies with Access-Accept if the prefix request can be
   satisfied.  In case of a prefix request that can not be fullfilled by
   PA Server, PA Server sends Access-Reject.  Reception of an Access-
   Reject indicates an unsuccessful prefix request made by PA Client.
   Reply-Message attribute indicates the failure message.  Prefix-
   Authorization type attribute MUST be set to Request.

4.2.  Prefix Release

   When a PA User detaches a PA Client, the prefixes allocated to the
   user should be released.  Access-Request is sent by a PA Client to a
   PA Server.  The server replies with Access-Accept to confirm the
   reception and process of the prefix release.

Internet-Draft         RADIUS Prefix Authorization            March 2009


   PA User and the prefixes to be released are identified in Access-
   Request and Access-Accept using Framed-Interface-Id attribute.
   Multiple occurrences of this attribute can be included to release
   multiple prefixes authorized to the same user or to release prefixes
   authorized to more than one user.

   Access-Request MUST contain Prefix-Authorization type attribute.  The
   value MUST be set to Release.  Access-Accept MUST contain Prefix-
   Authorization type attribute.  The value MUST be set to Release.

   PA Server replies with Access-Accept if the prefix release request
   can be satisfied.  In case of a prefix release request that can not
   be fullfilled by PA Server, PA Server sends Access-Reject.  Reception
   of an Access-Reject indicates an unsuccessful prefix release request
   made by PA Client.  Reply-Message attribute indicates the failure
   message.  Prefix-Authorization type attribute MUST be set to Release.

4.3.  Prefix Renew

   When the lifetime of prefixes will expire, a PA client renews the
   prefix using Access-Request message.  A PA server sends Access-Accept
   with the new lifetime of the prefixes.

   PA User and the prefixes to be renewed are identified in Access-
   Request and Access-Accept using Framed-Interface-Id attribute.
   Multiple occurrences of this attribute can be included to renew
   multiple prefixes authorized to the same user or to renew prefixes
   authorized to more than one user.

   Access-Request MUST contain Prefix-Authorization type attribute.  The
   value MUST be set to Renew.  Access-Accept MUST contain Prefix-
   Authorization type attribute.  The value MUST be set to Renew.

   PA Server replies with Access-Accept if the prefix renew request can
   be satisfied.  In case of a prefix renew request that can not be
   fullfilled by PA Server, PA Server sends Access-Reject.  Reception of
   an Access-Reject indicates an unsuccessful prefix renew request made
   by PA Client.  Reply-Message attribute indicates the failure message.
   Prefix-Authorization type attribute MUST be set to Renew.

4.4.  Prefix Renumbering

   Renumbering is an important feature of IPv6.  A PA Server sends
   Change-of-Authorization-Request message to initiate prefix
   renumbering process.  Once the message is received, a PA client
   replies with Change-of-Authorization-ACK and then starts the prefix
   renumber interactions to acquire new prefixes and reduce the lifetime
   of the old prefixes.  The server sends Access-Accept with new

   prefixes, at the same time the old prefixes are also included in the
   message while the lifetime is reduced.  The procedure is illustrated
   in Figure 2.

   Change-of-Authorization Request and Change-of-Authorization-ACK MUST
   contain Prefix-Authorization type with value set to Renumber.
   Access-Request MUST contain Prefix-Authorization type attribute.  The
   value MUST be set to Renumber.  Access-Accept MUST contain Prefix-
   Authorization type attribute.  The value MUST be set to Renumber.

   PA Server replies with Access-Accept if the prefix renumber request
   can be satisfied.  In case of a prefix renumber request that can not
   be fullfilled by PA Server, PA Server sends Access-Reject.  Reception
   of an Access-Reject indicates an unsuccessful prefix renumber request
   made by PA Client.  Reply-Message attribute indicates the failure
   message.  Prefix-Authorization type attribute MUST be set to
   Renumber.

5.1.  Service-Type

   PA Client uses Session-Type to indicate that the session is for
   prefix authorization by setting the Session-Type attribute to
   "Authorize Only".

5.2.  NAS-Port-Type

   NAS-Port-Type is used by AAA server (PA-Server) to distinguish the
   source of the Access-Request.

   When the Access-Request originates from an MIP6 HA or PMIP6 LMA, NAS-
   Port-Type MUST be included and its value set to HA6 as in
   [I-D.ietf-mip6-radius].

   When the Access-Request originates from an access router such as
   ASN-GW of WiMAX or Serving Gateway of 3GPP, NAS-Port-Type MUST be
   included and its value set to AR6 (IANA-TBD1).

5.3.  Message Authenticator

   Message-Authenticator attribute defined in [RFC3579] MUST be used to
   protect all messages used in Prefix Authorization.  In the messages
   used for renumbering, Message-Authenticator attribute is calculated
   as described in [RFC5176].

5.4.  Framed Interface Id

   Framed-Interface-Id attribute defined in [RFC3162] MUST be used in
   all messages defined above in Section 4.

5.5.  IPv6 Prefix Information

   IPv6-Prefix-Information attribute defined in
   [I-D.lourdelet-radext-ipv6-access] MUST be used in all messages
   defined above in Section 4.


6.  New Attributes

   This section defines new attributes.

6.1.  Prefix Authorization Type

   Prefix-Authorization-Type attribute contains the type of prefix
   authorization operation needed by PA Client.  The possible values are
   Request, Renew, Release and Renumber.

Internet-Draft         RADIUS Prefix Authorization            March 2009


   Prefix-Authorization attribute is defined as follows.


        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |   Type        |  Length       |     Prefix Authorization Type |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+





     Type        To be assigned by IANA.

     Length      The length, 4.

     Prefix Authorization Type is a 32-bit unsigned integer with the following values:
                1  Request
                2  Release
                3  Renew
                4  Renumber



7.  Table of Attributes

   The following tables provides a guide to which attributes may be
   found in RADIUS messages and in what number.  The following defines
   the meaning of the notation used in the following tables:


      0     An instance of this attribute MUST NOT be present.
      1     Exactly one instance of this attribute MUST be present
      0-1   Zero or one instance of this attribute MAY be present.
      0+    Zero or more instance of this attriubte MAY be present


   The table below describes the RADIUS messages used for bootstrapping
   and are exchanged between the NAS and the RADIUS Server.


Request  Accept  Reject  CoA Request  #        Attribute
 1        1      1       1            TBA      Prefix-Authorization-Type
 0+       0+     0+      0+           TBA      IPv6-Prefix-Information
 0+       0+     0+      0+           96       Framed-Interface-Id

8.  Diameter Considerations

   Prefix-Authorization-Type attribute defined in this specification.
   Diameter compatibility is assured.


9.  IANA considerations

9.1.  Registration of New AVPs

   This specification defines the following new RADIUS attribute.

   Prefix-Authorization is set to PREFIX-AUTHORIZATION-TYPE

9.2.  New Registry: Prefix Authorization Type

   This specification needs new values for Prefix-Authorization-Type.
   The value field is 4 octets.  The current values are listed in
   Section 6.1.

9.3.  Addition of Existing Values

   This specification requires a new value of AR6 to be assigned to NAS-
   Port-Type(61).


10.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the extension of RADIUS for Prefix
   Authorization.  The security considerations of the RADIUS protocol
   itself have been discussed in [RFC2865] and in [RFC5176].  Use of the
   attribute defined in this document MUST take into consideration the
   security issues and requirements of the RADIUS Base protocol.
