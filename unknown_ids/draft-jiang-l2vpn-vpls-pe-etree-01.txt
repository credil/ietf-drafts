Internet-Draft         VPLS PE Model for E-Tree               July 2010 
    

Abstract 

   The feasibility of VPLS as a general E-Tree solution is discussed. A 
   VPLS Provider Edge(PE) model for the E-Tree support is also proposed. 
   In this model, a Tree VSI and its PW processing is introduced which 
   can provide connectivity with dual VLANs for an E-Tree service. MAC 
   address based Ethernet forwarding engine works in the same way as 
   before in this architecture. As VLAN mapping may be needed in the 
   Ethernet PW for better scalability, control signaling needed for the 
   VLAN mapping is also discussed.

1. Introduction 

   E-Tree service is defined in Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) as rooted 
   multi-point EVC service, where traffic from a root can reach any root 
   or leaf, and traffic from a leaf can reach any root, but never reach 
   a leaf. Although VPMS or P2MP multicast is a somewhat simplified 
   version of this service, in fact there is no exact corresponding 
   terminology in IETF.  

   For a generic E-Tree service, connectivity shall be provided for:

   (1)    Multicast from a root to all leaves (and maybe all other 
          roots); 

   (2)    Unicast from a root to any leaf or any other root; 

   (3)    Unicast from a leaf to any root; 

   (4)    Multicast from a leaf to all roots; 

   Therefore, MAC address based forwarding is needed for a general E-
   Tree solution to distinguish between these packets and forward them 
   in a separate way. VSI in the VPLS can provide the needed 
   functionality of MAC address based forwarding. 

   [Etree-frwk] gives the requirements and a framework of a solution for 
   a E-Tree to filter leaf to leaf traffic in VPLS. [vpls-etree] shows 
   the details of the solution, where the Ethernet forwarder in the VPLS 
   is extended to filter the leaf-leaf traffic based on the <ingress 
   port, egress port, CW L-bit> tuple. This solution needs to change the 
   forwarding engine of the VSI, and the control word of the Ethernet PW. 

   Another solution was in discussion wherein root and leaf traffic are 
   classified and forwarded in two separate PWs. This is similar to the 
   hub & spoke L3VPN, wherein one PE attached with a root plays the role 
   of the hub, and all leaf traffic will take the way of this PE to 
   reach other roots. When a leaf co-sites with another root in a PE 
   different from the hub, the traffic must also make a detour to the 
   hub. Split horizon may also need to be extended to avoid loops in it. 

   This document introduces a dual VLAN solution for E-Tree support in 
   VPLS, which is more compatible with the traditional Ethernet and PW 
   technology, and VPLS scalability and simplicity is also well kept. 
   This also means it is possible to deploy a converged E-Tree solution 
   across both Ethernet and MPLS networks. 

   As an example, a new VPLS PE model is firstly introduced which 
   consists of a Tree VSI connected to the S-VLAN bridge with a dual-
   VLAN interface. This model also applies to a PE with C-VLAN or B-VLAN 
   as its provider's encapsulation. 

   This document then discusses the PW encapsulation and PW processing 
   such as VLAN mapping options for transporting E-Tree services in a 
   VPLS. 

   Finally the LDP extensions needed to support the optional VLAN 
   mapping mechanism are also discussed.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

3. Terminology 

   Most of the terminology used here is from [IEEE802.1Q], [IEEE802.1ad], 
   [RFC4664] and [RFC4762]. Terminology specific to this document is 
   introduced as needed in later sections.  

4. PE Model with E-Tree Support 

4.1. Existing PE Models with E-Tree Support 

   According to [RFC4664], there are at least three models for a VPLS PE, 
   including: 

   o  A single bridge module, a single VSI; 

   o  A single bridge module, multiple VSIs; 

   o  Multiple bridge modules, each attaches to a VSI. 

   The second PE model as depicted in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 is the most 
   suitable one for VPLS [vpls-interop], where the S-VLAN bridge module 
   is connected to multiple VSIs each with a single VLAN interface.

   In the above model, Ethernet service from the CEs will cross multiple 
   stages of bridge modules (i.e., C-VLAN and S-VLAN bridge) to access 
   the egress PWs. Therefore, the association of an AC port and an PW in 
   a single forwarding engine as required in [vpls-etree] is difficult, 
   sometimes even impossible. 

   Asymmetric VLAN is firstly introduced in IEEE 802.1Q, where traffics 
   from the root and the leaves are assigned with different VLANs, so 
   that the switch can filter on each leaf port all the traffic from the 
   VLANs associated with the leaves. 

   This model could be further enhanced by the introduction of trunk 
   VLAN and branch VLAN. All the traffics from the trunk VLAN are 
   received both on the roots and the leaves, while traffics from the 
   branch VLAN are received on the roots and dropped on the leaves. It 
   was demonstrated in [ETree-802.1Q] that E-Tree on Ethernet itself 
   could be well provisioned with this mechanism. It was anticipated 
   IEEE will further standardize this scheme in 802.1Q. 

   Should this mechanism be implemented in the bridge module, then it is 
   quite straightforward to infer the following VPLS PE model with E-
   Tree support (as shown in Fig. 3). But this model will require two

   is poorly scalable in a large MPLS/VPLS network.

4.2. A New PE Model with E-Tree Support 

   To provide for E-Tree support in a more scalable way, a new VPLS PE 
   model is proposed as depicted in  Fig. 4, where the S-VLAN bridge 
   module is connected to the Tree VSI (T-VSI, a VSI with E-Tree support) 
   with a dual-VLAN interface. That is, both the trunk S-VLAN and the 
   branch S-VLAN are connected to the Tree VSI (T-VSI). To be more 
   precise, they are called root and leaf S-VLAN respectively in this 
   document. In this way, only one VPLS instance and one set of PWs is 
   needed per E-Tree service. With this model, multiple E-Tree can also 
   be provided by the same T-VSI if needed, and further increase the 
   scalability of VPLS.

Internet-Draft         VPLS PE Model for E-Tree               July 2010 
    

   Both VLANs should share the same FIB and work in shared VLAN learning.  
   The traffic from the root UNIs are firstly tagged with root C-VLAN by 
   the C-VLAN bridge module, and then tagged with root S-VLAN by the S-
   VLAN bridge module, thus can only be transported on the root S-VLAN. 
   Similarly, the traffic from the leaves can only be transported on the 
   leaf S-VLAN. 
   In fact, this model also applies to a PE with C-VLAN (customer sites 
   attached with untagged ports), or B-VLAN (with a PBB bridge module in 
   the PE) as a provider's tag encapsulation. Therefore, the document 
   will use the VLAN tag as a generalized form in the latter sections. 
    
5. PW for E-Tree Support 

   T-VSIs from peer PEs in a VPLS are inter-connected with a PW, the 
   VLANs may be independently provisioned on each PE for better 
   scalability. That is, the assignment of VLANs in the PE may be local 
   to simplify the network provisioning. 

   In order to carry both VLANs (root and leaf VLAN) in a single PW and 
   map them into the remote peer's local VLANs, cares must be taken on 
   both the PEs associated with the PW.  

   Two options of VLAN mapping are possible for a PW: 

   o  local mapping, VLAN mapping is usually done when a frame exits the 
      PW. That is, the egress PE is responsible for mapping VLANs into 
      its local VLANs.  

   o  remote mapping, VLAN mapping is done when a frame enters the PW. 
      That is, the remote PE is responsible for mapping VLANs into the 
      local PE's VLANs. 

   Normally, each PE do its own local mapping. But when a PE is not 
   capable of VLAN mapping, then remote mapping must be done on its peer.  

5.1. Tagged Mode PW Encapsulation 

   For a VPLS instance to support E-Tree as described above, the 
   Ethernet PW should work in the tagged mode (PW type 0x0004) as 
   described in [RFC4448], and a C-VLAN, S-VLAN, or B-VLAN tag must be 
   carried in each frame in the PW, either the local or the remote VLAN 
   tag could be carried depending on the mapping option. In the local 
   mapping mode, the remote VLANs are carried with no change, while in 
   the remote mapping mode, the local mapped VLAN are carried instead. 

   The mapping between the local VLAN and the remote VLAN (local root

   should be provisioned by management or signaled by a control protocol 
   such as LDP. The LDP extension for E-Tree support is provided in 
   Section 6. 

5.2. PW Processing 

5.2.1. PW Processing in the Normal Mode 

   In the normal mode, two VPLS PEs both with T-VSI in it are inter-
   connected and both sides are miscellaneously attached with roots and 
   leaves, as shown in the scenario of Fig. 5. At the PE where a frame 
   exits the PW, if a frame with the remote leaf VLAN is received, then 
   it is mapped to the local leaf VLAN, otherwise, if a frame with the 
   remote root VLAN is received, then it is mapped to the local root 
   VLAN.

5.2.2. PW Processing in the Compatibility Mode 

   The new VPLS PE model can work in a traditional VPLS network 
   seamlessly in the compatibility mode. As shown in Fig. 5, the VPLS PE 
   with T-VSI can access both root and leaf node, while the VPLS PE with 
   VSI can only access the root node.

   In this case, the PE with a T-VSI in it must work in the 
   compatibility mode, that is, the egress PW of the T-VSI must 
   translate frames received over both local root and leaf VLAN into a 
   single VLAN (local root VLAN if the peer is capable of rewriting the 
   VLAN, or the remote peer's VLAN otherwise), while the ingress PW only 
   translates the frames received over the PW into the local root VLAN.

5.2.3. PW Processing in the Optimization Mode  

   When two VPLS PE with T-VSI are inter-connected and one side is 
   attached with pure leaves, as shown in the scenario of Fig. 6, the 
   egress PW of the miscellaneous attached PE then work in the 
   optimization mode, that is, the PE can drop all the frames received 
   over the local leaf VLAN rather than transport them over the PW and 
   be discarded on the remote PE. Thus bandwidth efficiency of the VPLS 
   can be improved.

6. LDP Extensions for E-Tree Support 

   To dynamically provision the E-Tree service using the signaling 
   procedures specified in [RFC4447], an E-Tree specific interface 
   parameter sub-TLV is proposed as follows:

   Where:  

   o  E-Tree is the sub-TLV identifier to be assigned by IANA. 

   o  Length is the length of the sub TLV in octets. 

   o  Reserved bits MUST be set to zero on transmit and be ignored on 
      receive. 

   o  P is a Pure Leaf bit, it is set to 1 to indicate that the PE is 
      attached with all leaves, and set to 0 otherwise. 

   o  R is a request bit of Remote VLAN Translation. If a PE is capable 
      of translating VLANs, then set R to 0, otherwise set R to 1. If a 
      PE receives R=1 from its peer, then it must do VLAN translation 
      for this peer, otherwise local mapping rule applies. 

   o  Root VLAN ID is the value of the local root VLAN. 

   o  Leaf VLAN ID is the value of the local leaf VLAN. 

   When the VPLS supporting an E-Tree service is setting up the PW, the 
   PW endpoints negotiate the E-Tree support using the above E-Tree sub-
   TLV. Note PW type of 0x0004 should be used during the PW negotiation. 

   A PE that wishes to support E-Tree service includes in its PW label 
   mapping message an E-Tree Sub-TLV, with its local root VLAN and leaf 
   VLAN carried in the Root VLAN ID and Leaf VLAN ID field respectively.  
   A PE that has E-Tree capability and willing to support it MUST 
   include an E-Tree Sub-TLV with its own local root VLAN and leaf VLAN. 
   A PE that is incapable of translating VLANs must set the R bit to 1. 
   And a PE is attached with pure leaves should set the P bit to 1. 

   If a PE has sent an E-Tree Sub-TLV and has received an E-Tree Sub-TLV, 
   then it must work as described in Section 5.2.1. If the bit "L" is 
   set, then it should work as described in Section 5.2.3.

   If a PE has sent an E-Tree Sub-TLV and does not receive an E-Tree 
   Sub-TLV, then it must work in the mode of compatibility as described 
   in Section 5.2.2. 

   BGP may also be used to distribute the VLAN mapping TLV.  

    

7. Security Considerations 

   To be added in the next version. 

8. IANA Considerations 

   IANA is requested to allocate a value for E-Tree in the Pseudowire 
   Interface Parameters Sub-TLV type registry.
