1. Introduction 

   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) defines a series of 
   protocols, including Open Shortest Path Fist - Traffic Engineering 
   (OSPF-TE) and Resource ReserVation Protocol - Traffic Engineering 
   (RSVP-TE), which can be used to create Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in 
   a number of deployment scenarios with various transport technologies.  

   The User-Network Interface (UNI) reference point is defined in the 
   Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON) [G.8080]. The GMPLS 
   overlay model, as per [RFC4208], can be applied at the UNI, as shown 
   in Figure 1.

              Figure 1 - Applying GMPLS overlay model at UNI 

   Assume that there is an end-to-end UNI connection passing through 
   EN1-CN1-CN2-CN3-EN3. For convenience, some terms used in this 
   document are defined below: 

   -  "source EN" refers to the edge-node who initiates the connection 
      (e.g., EN1);  

   -  "destination EN" refers to the edge-node where the connection is 
      terminated (e.g., EN3);

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-uni-app-00.txt                       March 2011 


   -  "ingress CN" refers to the core-node to which the source EN is 
      attached (e.g., CN1);  

   -  "egress CN" refers to the core-node to which the destination EN 
      is attached (e.g., CN3). 

   [RFC4208] provides mechanisms for UNI signaling, which are compatible 
   with GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling ([RFC3471] and [RFC3473]). A single end-
   to-end RSVP session between source EN and destination EN is used for 
   the user connection, which is similar to connection creation between 
   two core nodes. When considering the isolation of topology 
   information between core network and the overlay network, additional 
   processing of the ERO and RRO is required. For example, the ingress 
   CN should verify the ERO it received against its topology database 
   before forwarding the PATH message. And the ingress/egress CN may 
   edit or remove the RRO in order to hide the path segment used inside 
   the core network from the EN. 

   The UNI can be used in many application scenarios. For example, in a 
   multi-layer network, the interface between client layer node and 
   server layer node can be seen as a UNI. Or, when deploying VPN 
   services, users can connect to a service provider network via UNI. 

   This document examines a number of current and future GMPLS 
   application scenarios. It shows how techniques developed after the 
   GMPLS UNI was developed can be used to automate or enable critical 
   aspects of these application scenarios. It points out some potential 
   technology extensions that could improve UNI operation, and 
   highlights some existing unresolved issues. 

    

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",   
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this   
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

    

3. UNI Addressing 

   In [RFC4208], the GMPLS overlay model is applied at the UNI reference 
   point, and it is required that the edge-node and its attached core-
   node of the overlay network share the same address space that is used 
   by GMPLS to signal between the edge-nodes across the core network. 
   Under this condition, the user connection can be created using a 
 
 
Zhang                  Expires September 2011                  [Page 4] 

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-uni-app-00.txt                       March 2011 


   single end-to-end RSVP session, which is consistent with the RSVP 
   model. Therefore, RSVP-TE defined in [RFC3473] can be used for 
   support GMPLS UNI without any extensions.  

   However, in the practical deployment of GMPLS UNI, the requirement of 
   sharing the same address space between EN and its attached CN may not 
   be satisfied if the core network and the overlay network are designed 
   and deployed separately, especially if the two networks belong to 
   different carriers. For example, the core network may use IPv6 
   addresses, while the overlay network uses IPv4 addresses. Or, since 
   the core network is a closed system, the assignment of the IP 
   addresses of the CNs is independent of other IP addresses outside the 
   core network. This implies that the nodes in the core network may use 
   addresses which collide with the edge nodes in the overlay network. 

   In the cases above, due to the address space incompatibility issues, 
   the RSVP-TE [RFC3473] session may not be used to create the UNI 
   connection. Hence [RFC4208] needs to be extended to support the 
   different address space between Core network and Overlay network.  

    

4. UNI Auto Discovery 

   In most cases, the source EN does not have the knowledge of which CN 
   the destination EN is attached and TE information concerning the 
   destination UNI link. When creating the connection, information about 
   the destination EN is carried in the signaling message sent to the 
   ingress CN. 

   The ingress CN is then responsible for resolving the address of the 
   egress CN based on the destination EN information and examine whether 
   there is sufficient resources on the destination UNI link. In other 
   words, the CN should have the mapping relationship between CNs and 
   ENs and the TE information of the corresponding UNI links. Therefore, 
   some kind of UNI auto discovery or manual configuration is required. 

   We can avoid manual configuration if the UNI is applied in a Layer 1 
   Virtual Private Network (L1VPN, [RFC4847]) scenario. In this case the 
   auto discovery of UNI using OSPFv2 is provided in [RFC5252]. A new 
   L1VPN LSA is introduced to advertise the L1VPN information via the 
   L1VPN info TLV and the TE information of the CE-PE link (in the 
   language of UNI, it's the EN-CN link) via the TE link TLV.

5. UNI Path Computation 

   The end-to-end UNI path computation includes three parts: the 
   selection of source UNI link, the path computation inside the core 
   network and the selection of destination UNI link. 

   The selection of UNI link may not necessary in some scenarios. One 
   example is in case of single-homing with only one UNI link between EN 
   and CN, and another example is manual selection of UNI link. In such 
   cases, the CN to which the source EN is attached, or the PCE 
   ([RFC4655]) which is responsible for the core network, can perform 
   the path computation for traversing the core network when the UNI 
   signaling sent from the source EN reaches to the CN.  

5.1. UNI Link Selection 

   The source EN does not have the topology and TE information of the 
   core network in the overlay model. Therefore, in the case of multi-
   homing, the source EN does not have enough information to make a 
   correct choice among all the UNI links between itself and the core 
   network for an optimal end-to-end connection. 

   In this case, a PCE whose computation domain covers both the core 
   network and the ENs attached to it can be used. Note that the GMPLS 
   UNI predates PCE and hence a PCE was not available to solve this 
   problem in early GMPLS UNI deployments. The PCE can use the UNI 
   discovery mechanism described in Section 4.  to learn the EN-CN 
   relationship and the TE information of the UNI links, and therefore 
   has the ability to select the optimal UNI link for the connection.  

   Figure 2 shows an example of UNI path computation. The PCE can help 
   the source EN to compute the end-to-end connection when the UNI path 
   computation request is received, so that the source EN can learn 
   which UNI link to be selected.

                  Figure 2 - PCE for UNI path computation 

   In cases where the confidentiality of the topology within the core 
   network needs to be preserved, the Path Key Subobject (PKS) can be 
   used (See [RFC5520] and [RFC5553]). In the PCRep message returned to 
   EN1, the Confidential Path Segment (CPS) (i.e., CN4-CN5-CN6) is 
   encoded as a PKS by the PCE. Therefore, the EN1 only learns the 
   selected UNI link from PCE. When receiving the UNI signaling carrying 
   the PKS from EN1, CN4 can request the PCE to decode the PKS and then 
   continue to create the connection. 

   Note that the PCE should be visible to the ENs and there should be 
   control channel between PCE and EN for the transmission of PCEP 
   messages. An alternative implementation could be that the PCE is 
   located inside each CN to which the source EN is attached, so that 
   the source EN can use the UNI control channel to send and receive the 
   PCEP messages. 

6. UNI Path Provisioning 

   The basic GMPLS UNI application is to provide end-to-end connections 
   between edge-nodes through a core network via the overlay model. 

6.1. Flat Model 

   The edge-nodes may have the same switching capability and switching 
   capacity as the nodes in the core network. In this case, one single

   end-to-end RSVP session through the edge-nodes and a series of core-
   nodes can be used to create the connection, which forms a flat LSP 
   model (in the language of [RFC5251], such end-to-end RSVP session is 
   called Shuffling Session), as shown in Figure 3.

                           Figure 3 - Flat model 

   If the edge-nodes and their attached core-nodes share the same 
   address space, the GMPLS signaling described in [RFC3471], [RFC3473] 
   and other related standards, with  special ERO and RRO processing as 
   described in [RFC4208], can be used to create a connection. 

6.2. Stitching Model 

   Alternatively, in the above case, the stitching mechanism described 
   in [RFC5150] can be used to create an LSP segment (S-LSP) between the 
   ingress and the egress CN, and to stitch the end-to-end UNI 
   connection to the created S-LSP, as shown in Figure 4.

6.3. Hierarchy Model 

   In case that the ENs and the CNs have the same switching capability, 
   a tunnel between the ingress and egress core-nodes can be provisioned. 
   The tunnel may have a larger capacity than the end-to-end UNI 
   connection, which may depend on the policies configured at the 
   ingress of the core network. The end-to-end connection can be nested 
   into the tunnel, which forms the LSP hierarchy. 

   Another case is that the edge-nodes have different switching 
   capabilities with the core network. In such a case, the LSP hierarchy 
   model should also be used.

                        Figure 5 - Hierarchy model 

   In the hierarchy model, the end-to-end connection can be divided into 
   three hops: one for each UNI link and one hop across the core network. 
   The core network tunnel can be pre-provisioned via network planning, 
   or triggered by the UNI signal. For the latter case, the [RFC5212], 
   [RFC6001] and other multi-layer network related standards are 
   possible to be used to create the hierarchical LSP. 

    

7. UNI Recovery 

   One of the significant uses of GMPLS is to provide recovery 
   mechanisms for connections, which is also needed in many UNI 
   scenarios.

7.1. End-to-end Recovery 

   In the case of multi-homing, UNI end-to-end recovery is possible. As 
   shown in Figure 6, the working path (W) and the protection path (P) 
   are disjoint from each other not only inside the core network, but 
   also at both the source and destination sides of the UNI. Mechanisms 
   need to be provided to ensure the selection of disjoint working and 
   backup paths.

7.1.1. Serial Provisioning of Working & Protection Path 

   In the case that the working path is computed and created before the 
   protection path, path computation needs to compute a disjoint (or 
   maximally disjoint) protection path given this existing working path. 

   If the information concerning the working path segment traversing the 
   core network is known by the EN without considering the 
   confidentiality, then the EN can easily use the RRO to collect the 
   working path information, and use the XRO to exclude the working path 
   when creating the protection path, as described in [RFC4874]. 

   But in most cases, in order to preserve the confidentiality of 
   topology within the core network, the information of path segment 
   traversing the core network should be hidden from the EN. In such 
   case, the RRO & XRO mechanism in [RFC4874] cannot be used. An 
   alternative would be to only collect the Shared Risk Group (SRG) 
   information but not the full path information. This is because the 
   SRG information is normally less confidential than the information of

   node ID and link ID and can be allowed to be known outside the core 
   network. 

   In an application scenario where a PCE is involved inside the core 
   network, then the Path Key mechanism can be used. The confidential 
   path segment, i.e., the working path segment traversing the core 
   network, is encoded as a PKS by the PCE when computing the working 
   path. This PKS can be brought to the source EN, so when it request 
   that the PCE compute a protection path, the PKS can be used to 
   exclude the working path segment inside the core network. 

   [RFC5520] provides a mechanism to hide the CPS using PKS in the PCEP 
   message, while [RFC5553] makes extensions to RSVP-TE to carry the PKS 
   in ERO and RRO objects. It is required that the PKS should also be 
   allowed to be carried in the XRO in both PCEP message and RSVP-TE 
   signaling. 

    

7.1.2. Concurrent Computation of Working & Protection Path 

   Alternatively, the working and protection path can be computed at the 
   same time (e.g., by PCE or by one of the CNs to which the source EN 
   is attached).  

   [PCE-GMPLS] allows requesting the PCE for path computation with 
   specified protection type defined in [RFC4872]. Therefore, it's 
   possible that the source EN requests the edge CN or PCE to compute 
   both the working and the protection path at the same time. At this 
   time, the disjunction problem can be resolved inside the path 
   computation server. 

   Same as described in the previous section, the path segment 
   traversing the core network can be encoded as a PKS if 
   confidentiality is requested. 

    

7.2. Segment Recovery 

   The UNI connection may only request protection inside the core 
   network, especially in case of single-homing. One UNI segment 
   protection example is shown in Figure 7.

                      Figure 7 - UNI segment recovery 

   [RFC4873] provides the mechanism of segment recovery, in which the 
   PROTECTION Object is extended to indicate the segment recovery, and 
   the SERO object is introduced for the explicit control of the 
   protection LSP between the branch node and the merge node. 

   However, due to the overlay model, the source EN may not have the 
   information concerning the CN to which the destination EN is attached. 
   In other words, the source EN does not know which node is the merge 
   node of the UNI segment protection, so the SERO object cannot be used 
   to request the edge CN for the UNI segment recovery. Therefore, 
   segment recovery may not be controlled explicitly by the source EN. 

    

8. UNI Call 

   The GMPLS Call, defined in [RFC4974], provides a mechanism to 
   negotiate agreement between endpoints possibly in cooperation with 
   the nodes that provide access to the network. Typically the GMPLS 
   Call can be applied in the UNI scenario for access link capability 
   exchange, policy, authorization, security, and so on. 

8.1. Exchange of UNI Link Information 

   It is possible that the TE attributes of the access link (i.e., the 
   UNI link) are not shared across the core network. So the source EN 
   may not have the TE information of the destination access link as 
   well as the capability of the destination EN. For example, in case of 
   TDM network, the VCAT/LCAS capability of the destination EN may not 
   be known.  

   In this case, the source EN can raise a Call carrying the

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-uni-app-00.txt                       March 2011 


   LINK_CAPABILITY object to have a capability exchange with the 
   destination EN, as described in [RFC4974]. 

8.2. Control of Call Route 

   When applying the Call, it's possible that there are multiple core 
   network domains between the source EN (Call initiator) and the 
   destination EN (Call terminator), or there is more than one Call 
   manager in the core network (e.g., in the multi-homing scenario where 
   the CNs to which the ENs are attached act as the Call managers). 

   In the both cases, when establishing the Call, there may be multiple 
   alternative routes for the Call message to reach the destination EN. 
   One can simply use the hop-by-hop manner (i.e., each Call manager 
   determines the next Call manager to which the Call message will be 
   sent by itself) to control the path of the Call. 

   However, in the practical deployment of UNI Call, commercial and 
   policy motivations normally play an important role in selecting the 
   Call route, especially in the multi-domain scenario. In this case, 
   the hop-by-hop manner is not practical because the route of the Call 
   needs to be pre-determined in consideration of commercial and policy 
   factors before establishing the Call. 

   Therefore, it is desirable to allow full control of the Call by the 
   source EN. That is, the source EN can identify the full Call route 
   and signal it explicitly, so that the Call message can be forwarded 
   along the desired route. Moreover, the management plane needs to be 
   able to identify the Call route explicitly as an instruction to the 
   source EN. 

    

9. UNI Multicast 

   There is desired to support point-to-multipoint (P2MP) TE LSPs from 
   one source EN to multiple leaf ENs. 

   There are two cases for the UNI multicast. For the first case, only 
   the ingress and egress CNs in the core network support the multicast. 
   The core network has to provide multiple P2P connections between 
   ingress CN and each egress CN for the end-to-end UNI multicast, as 
   shown in Figure 8. 

   For example, in the PSC over TDM multi-layer scenario, the 
   ingress/egress CNs may have the packet multicast capability and 
   therefore can adapt the packets from EN into multiple TDM connections

   inside the core network, while other CNs inside the core network may 
   only support point-to-point (P2P) TDM connections.

   For example, in the Ethernet over OTN scenario, if the core network 
   can support ODU0 multicast, then an ODU0 P2MP LSP can be created 
   inside the core network to carry the client Gigabit Ethernet (GE) 
   signal for the ENs.  

9.1. UNI Multicast Connection Provisioning 

   The three UNI connection provisioning models, as described in Section 
   6, should also be applied in the UNI multicast scenario. 

   For the flat model, one end-to-end P2MP session as described in 
   [RFC4875] can be used directly to create the P2MP LSP from source EN 
   to leaf ENs. 

   For the stitching model, multiple P2P LSP segments or one P2MP LSP 
   segment between the ingress CN and each egress CNs needs to be 
   created and then stitched to the UNI P2MP LSP. GMPLS UNI signaling 
   should have the capability to convey the multicast information by 
   using stitching model. 

   For the hierarchy model, multiple P2P LSP tunnels or one P2MP LSP 
   tunnel between the ingress CN and each egress CNs needs be triggered 
   by the UNI signaling for creating P2MP LSP. GMPLS UNI signaling 
   should have the capability to convey the multicast information by 
   using hierarchy model.
