        Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) - MOVE extension
                    draft-krecicki-imap-move-00.txt

Abstract

   The MOVE extension of the Internet Message Access Protocol [IMAP4]
   provides a feature intended to reduce the amount of time and
   resources used by usual complicated methods of moving messages
   between mailboxes by providing the capability of directly moving
   messages.

1.  Conventions Used in this Document

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to
   be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].


2.  Introduction and Overview

   Most of IMAP clients are moving messages between mailboxes by use of
   sequence of COPY, STORE +FLAGS (\Deleted) and EXPUNGE commands.
   This, though functionally equivalent to moving messages, is a lot
   more complicated on the server side than simple move.  When moving
   large amounts of messages this can create unnecessary loads and
   delays on server side.  It also prohibits user from moving a message
   larger than remainings of his quota.

   The MOVE extension allows simple single-command moving of messages
   between mailboxes without creating additional unnecessary server-side
   loads and without requiring user consideration about his quota limits
   when simply moving message and not changing the overall amount of
   data stored in his account.

   The MOVE extension is present in any IMAP server implementation which
   returns "MOVE" as one of the supported capabilities to the CAPABILITY
   command.

   The MOVE extension defines one additional command which MUST be
   supported by server that returns supports MOVE extension.


3.  Additional commands

   The following command definition is an extension to [IMAP4] section
   6.4.

3.1.  MOVE command

       Arguments:  sequence set
                   mailbox name

       Data:       untagged responses: EXPUNGE

       Result:     OK - move completed
                   NO - move error: can't move those messages or to that
                        mailbox
                   BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

   The MOVE command moves messages from the currently selected mailbox
   to the end of the specified mailbox.  Messages that are moved are
   expunged from selected mailbox.  Any messages that are not included
   in the sequence set or do not exists are unaffected.  All flags
   (including \Deleted) and message internal date are persistent through
   move.

   If the server does not support the MOVE capability, the client should
   fall back to using the regular COPY, STORE, EXPUNGE sequence.

   Additionally, MOVE command can be directly preceeded by UID command,
   the sequence set argument is then treated as unique identifiers
   sequence instead of message sequence numbers as defined in [IMAP4]
   paragraph 6.4.8.

   Command EXPUNGE untagged responses reports that the specified message
   sequence number has been permanently removed from selected mailbox
   (and moved to specified mailbox) as defined in [IMAP4] paragraph
   7.4.1.


       Example:    C: A003 MOVE 3000:3002 Trash
                   S: * 3002 EXPUNGE
                   S: * 3001 EXPUNGE
                   S: * 3000 EXPUNGE
                   S: A003 OK MOVE completed
                   C: A004 UID MOVE 4000:* Trash
                   S: * 3010 EXPUNGE
                   S: * 3009 EXPUNGE
                   S: * 3008 EXPUNGE
                   S: A004 OK MOVE completed


4.  Response Codes

   If server supports both UIDPLUS and MOVE extensions it SHOULD return
   COPYUID response code as a part of tagged OK response to a MOVE
   command, as defined in [UIDPLUS] paragraph 4.3.

5.  Formal Syntax

   Formal syntax is defined using ABNF [ABNF], extending the ABNF rules
   defined in [IMAP4].  The IMAP4 ABNF should be imported first before
   attempting to validate these rules.


       capability      =/ "MOVE"

       command-select  =/ move

       move            = "MOVE" SP sequence-set SP mailbox

       uid             = "UID" SP (copy / fetch / search / store / move)
                           ; Unique identifiers used instead of message
                           ; sequence numbers



6.  IANA Considerations

   This document constitutes registration of the MOVE capability in the
   imap4-capabilities.
