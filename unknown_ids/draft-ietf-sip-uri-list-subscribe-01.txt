Abstract

   This document specifies a way to create subscription to a list of
   resources in SIP.  This is achieved by including the list of
   resources in the body of a SUBSCRIBE request.  Instead of having a
   subscriber send a SUBSCRIBE request for each resource individually,

   the subscriber defines the resource list, subscribes to it, and gets
   notifications about changes in the resources' state using a single
   SUBSCRIBE dialog.

Internet-Draft          SUBSCRIBE-Contained Lists           January 2007


1.  Introduction

   RFC 4662 [4] specifies how to establish subscriptions to a
   homogeneous resource list in SIP (which is specified in RFC 3261 [2])
   and defines the procedures for getting notifications about changes in
   the state of the associated resources.  Yet, list creation is outside
   the scope of RFC 4662 [4].

   This document specifies a way to create a list with a set of
   resources and subscribe to it using a single SIP request.  This is
   achieved by including the list of resources (as defined in RFC xxxx
   [5]) in the body of the SUBSCRIBE request.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].


3.  User Agent Client Procedures

   A UAC (User Agent Client) that wants to create a resource list and
   subscribe to it using the mechanism described in this document,
   constructs a SUBSCRIBE request with at least one body, whose
   disposition is type "recipient-list" as defined in RFC xxxx [5],
   containing the URI-list.  Additionally, the UAC MUST include the
   'recipient-list-subscribe' option-tag, which is registered with the
   IANA in Section 9, in a Require header field.  The UAC MUST build the
   remaining of the SUBSCRIBE request following the rules in RFC 3265
   [3].

   The UAC MUST support the "rlmi+xml" format defined in RFC 4662 [4]
   and signal this by including "rlmi+xml" in the Accept header.  The
   UAC MAY support additional formats and include them in the Accept
   header field of the SUBSCRIBE request.

3.1.  Response Handling

   The status code in the response to the SUBSCRIBE request does not
   provide any information about whether or not the resource list server
   was able to successfully subscribe to the URIs in the URI-list.  The
   UAC obtains this information in the notifications sent by the server.

Internet-Draft          SUBSCRIBE-Contained Lists           January 2007


3.2.  Subsequent SUBSCRIBE Requests

   The previous sections have specified how to include a URI-list in an
   initial SUBSCRIBE request to a resource list server in order to
   subscribe to the state of a set of resources.  Once the subscription
   has been created and a dialog between the UAC and the resource list
   server has been established, the UAC can send subsequent SUBSCRIBE
   requests to, for example, extend the duration of the subscription.

   At this point, there are no semantics associated with resource-list
   bodies in subsequent SUBSCRIBE requests (although future extensions
   can define them).  Therefore, UACs SHOULD NOT include resource-list
   bodies in subsequent SUBSCRIBE requests to a resource list server.

      Note that a difference between an initial SUBSCRIBE request and
      subsequent ones is that while the initial request is sent to the
      public URI of the resource list, subsequent ones are sent to the
      URI provided by the server when the dialog was established.
      Therefore, from the UAC's point of view, the resource identified
      by the former URI supports recipient-list bodies while the
      resource identified by the latter does not support them.


4.  URI-List Document Format

   RFC xxxx [5] mandates that each URI-list services specification, such
   as the subscription service defined here, specifies the default
   format for the recipient-list bodies used within the particular
   service.

   The default format for the recipient-list bodies for the subscription
   service defined in this document is the resource list format defined
   in RFC xxxx [6].  UAs (User Agents) generating recipient-list bodies
   MUST support this format and MAY support other formats.  Resource
   list servers able to handle recipient-list bodies MUST support this
   format and MAY support other formats.

   The Extensible Markup Language (XML) Configuration Access Protocol
   (XCAP) resource list document provides features, such as hierarchical
   lists and the ability to include entries by reference relative to the
   XCAP root URI, that are not needed by the subscription service
   defined here, which only needs to transfer a flat list of URIs
   between a UA and the resource list server.  Therefore, when using the
   default resource list document, UAs SHOULD use flat lists (i.e., no
   hierarchical lists) and SHOULD NOT use <entry-ref> elements.  A
   resource list server receiving a URI-list with more information than
   what has just been described MAY discard all the extra information.

   list document.

     <list>
       <entry uri="sip:bill@example.com" />
       <entry uri="sip:joe@example.org" />
       <entry uri="sip:ted@example.net" />
     </list>
   </resource-lists>

                            Figure 1: URI-List


5.  Resource List Server Behavior

   Resource list servers that are able to receive and process SUBSCRIBE
   requests with a recipient-list body SHOULD include a 'recipient-list-
   subscribe' option-tag in a Supported header field when responding to
   OPTIONS requests.

   On reception of a SUBSCRIBE request with a URI-list, a resource list
   server, which chooses to accept the "rlmi+xml" format, MUST comply
   with RFC 4662 [4] for creating the subscription and reporting the
   changes in the resources within the created dialog.

5.1.  Subsequent SUBSCRIBE Requests

   At this point, there are no semantics associated with resource-list
   bodies in subsequent SUBSCRIBE requests (although future extensions
   may define them).  Therefore, a resource list server receiving a
   subsequent SUBSCRIBE request with a resource-list body, following
   standard SIP procedures, rejects it with a 415 (Unsupported Media
   Type) response.


6.  Providing a URI to Manipulate a Resource List

   A UAC can manipulate a resource list at a resource list server.  The
   resource list server MAY provide a URI to manipulate the resource
   list associated with a subscription using the Call-Info header field
   in the NOTIFY request that establishes the subscription.  The
   "purpose" parameter of the Call-Info header field MUST have a value
   of 'list-management', which we register with the IANA in Section 9.
   The following is an example of such a header field.




Camarillo, et al.         Expires July 30, 2007                 [Page 5]


Internet-Draft          SUBSCRIBE-Contained Lists           January 2007


   Call-Info: <http://xcap.example.com/your-list.xml>
              ;purpose=list-management

   The life-time of a resource list to be manipulated by the URI
   provided by the server is bundled to the life-time of the
   subscription.  That is, the resource list SHOULD be destroyed when
   the subscription expires or is otherwise terminated.

   Section 7.1 of RFC 3265 [3] does not list the Call-Info header field
   in the table of header fields NOTIFY requests can carry.  This
   document updates that table so that the Call-Info header field can be
   optionally included in NOTIFY requests.


7.  Example

   The following is an example of a SUBSCRIBE request, which carries a
   URI-list in its body, sent by a UAC to a resource list server.

8.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations Section of RFC 4662 [4] discusses
   security issues related to resource list servers.  Resource list
   servers accepting request-contained URI-lists MUST also follow the
   security guidelines given in RFC 4662 [4].

   The Framework and Security Considerations for SIP URI-List Services
   (which is specified in RFC xxxx [5]) discusses issues related to SIP
   URI-list services.  Given that a resource list server sending
   SUBSCRIBE requests to a set of users acts as a URI-list service,
   implementations of resource list servers that handle request-
   contained URI-lists MUST follow the security-related rules in RFC
   xxxx [5].  These rules include mandatory authentication and

   authorization of clients, and opt-in lists.


9.  IANA Considerations

   The following sections request the IANA to register the 'list-
   management' value for the purpose parameter of the Call-Info header
   field and the 'recipient-list-subscribe' SIP option-tag.

9.1.  List-management Purpose Parameter Value

   This document defines the 'list-management' value for the purpose
   parameter of the Call-Info header field.  A reference to this RFC (in
   double brackets) needs to be added to the existing purpose Call-Info
   parameter entry in the SIP Parameters registry.

9.2.  Recipient-list-subscribe Option-Tag

   This document defines the SIP option tag "recipient-list-subscribe".

   The following row shall be added to the "Option Tags" section of the
   SIP Parameter Registry:


 +--------------------------+------------------------------+-----------+
 | Name                     | Description                  | Reference |
 +--------------------------+------------------------------+-----------+
 | recipient-list-subscribe | This option tag is used to   | [RFCXXXX] |
 |                          | ensure that a server can     |           |
 |                          | process the 'recipient-list' |           |
 |                          | body used in a SUBSCRIBE     |           |
 |                          | request.                     |           |
 +---------------------------------------------------------+-----------+

   Editor Note: [RFCXXXX] should be replaced with the designation of
   this document.
