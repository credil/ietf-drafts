1. Introduction 

   Networks may comprise multiple layers which have different switching 
   technologies or different switching granularity levels. The GMPLS 
   technology is required to support control of such network. 

   [RFC5212] defines the concept of MRN/MLN and describes the framework 
   and requirements of GMPLS controlled MRN/MLN. The GMPLS extension for 
   MRN/MLN, including routing aspect and signaling aspect, is described 
   in [MLN-EXT]. 

   [RFC4206] and [RFC4206bis] describe how to set up a hierarchy LSP 
   passing through multi-layer network and how to advertise the 
   forwarding adjacency LSP (FA-LSP) created in the server layer network 
   as a TE link via GMPLS signaling and routing protocols.  

   Based on these existing standards, this document further describes 
   the provisioning of FA-LSP when the region nodes supporting multiple 
   interface switching capabilities and multiple switching granularities, 
   and then provides the extensions to the RSVP-TE protocol in order to

   set up hierarchy LSP according to the modes of hierarchy LSP 
   provisioning. 

    

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",   
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

3. Provisioning of FA-LSP in Server Layer Network 

3.1. Selection of Switching Layers 

   As described in [RFC5212], the edge node of a region always has 
   multiple Interface Switching Capabilities (ISCs), i.e., it contains 
   multiple matrices which may be connected to each other by internal 
   links. Nodes with multiple Interface Switching Capabilities are 
   further classified as "simplex" or "hybrid" nodes by [RFC5212] and 
   [RFC5339], where the simplex node advertises several TE links each 
   with a single ISC value carried in its ISCD sub-TLV, while the hybrid 
   node advertises a single TE link containing more than one ISCD each 
   with a different ISC value. An example hybrid node with a link having 
   multiple ISCs is shown in Figure 1, copied from [RFC5339].

   It's possible that the edge node of a region is a hybrid node which 
   has multiple ISCs in the server layer. In this case, selection of 
   which server layer to create the FA-LSP is necessary. 

   Figure 2 shows an example multi-layer network, where node B and C are 
   region edge nodes having three switching matrices which support, for 
   instance, PSC, TDM and WDM switching, respectively. The three 
   switching matrices are connected to each other by the internal links. 
   Both the link between B and E and the link between E and C support 
   TDM and WDM switching capabilities.

              Figure 2 - MLN with multiple ISCs at edge node 

   As can be seen in Figure 2, there are two choices when providing FA 
   in the PSC layer network between node B and C: one is creating FA-LSP 
   with TDM switching matrix through node B, E and C, the other is 
   creating FA-LSP with WDM switching matrix through node B, E and C. 

   [MLN-EXT] introduces a new SC (Switching Capability) sub-object into 
   the XRO (ref. to [RFC4874]), which is used to indicate which 
   switching capability is not expected to be used. When one of the 
   switching capabilities is selected, the SC sub-object can be included 
   in the message to exclude all other SCs. 

3.2. Selection of Switching Granularity Levels 

   Even in the case that the edge node only has one switching capability 
   in the server layer, there may be still multiple choices for the 
   server layer network to set up FA-LSP to provide new FA in the client 
   layer network. This is because the server layer network may have the

        Figure 3a - Multiple switching granularities in server layer 

   Figure 3a shows an example multi-region network, where the edge node 
   B and C have PSC and TDM switching matrices, and where the TDM 
   switching matrix supports ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3 switching levels. 
   Therefore, when an FA between node B and C in the PSC layer network 
   is needed, either of ODU1, ODU2 or ODU3 connection (FA-LSP) can be 
   created in the TDM layer network.

   Figure 3b is another example multi-layer network within the same 
   region. When there is a need to set up an FA between node B and C for 
   the client layer ODU0 connection, the server layer has multiple 
   choices, e.g., ODU1 or ODU2 or ODU3, for the FA-LSP if the multi-
   stage multiplexing is supported at node B and C.

                  Figure 3c - PSC nested LSP provisioning 

   Figure 3c is a third example showing an LSP nesting scenario in a PSC 
   signal-layer network (e.g., an MPLS-TP network). A PSC tunnel passing 
   through node B, E and C is requested to carry the client layer LSP. 
   There are multiple choices of the bandwidth of the tunnel, on the 
   premise that the bandwidth of the FA-LSP is equal to or larger than 
   the client layer LSP. 

   The selection of server layer switching matrix and switching 
   granularity is based on both policy and bandwidth resources. The 
   selection can be performed by planning tool and/or NMS/PCE/VNTM 
   (Virtual Network Topology Manager, see [RFC5623]) and/or the network 
   node. 

    

4. Requirements of SC and Switching Granularity Selection 

   [RFC5623], the framework of PCE-based MLN, provides the models of 
   cross-layer LSP path computation and creation, which are listed below: 

   -  Inter-Layer Path Computation Models: 

      o  Single PCE 

 
 
Zhang                    Expires April 2011                    [Page 6] 

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-h-lsp-mln-02.txt                   October 2010 


      o  Multiple PCE with inter-PCE 

      o  Multiple PCE without inter-PCE 

   -  Inter-Layer Path Control Models: 

      o  PCE-VNTM cooperation 

      o  Higher-layer signaling trigger 

      o  NMS-VNTM cooperation (integrated flavor) 

      o  NMS-VNTM cooperation (separate flavor)   

   This session keeps align with [RFC5623] except that the restriction 
   of using PCE for path computation is not necessary (i.e., other 
   element, such as network node, may also have path computation 
   capability). 

   In this document, those models in [RFC4206] are reclassified into 3 
   models on the viewpoint of signaling: 

   -  Model 1: Pre-provisioning of FA-LSP 

   -  Model 2: Signaling trigger server layer path computation 

   -  Model 3: Full path computation at source node 

    

4.1. Model 1: Pre-provisioning of FA-LSP 

   In this model, the FA-LSP in the server layer is created before 
   initiating the signaling of the client layer LSP. Two typical 
   scenarios using this model are: 

   -  Network planning and building at the stage of client network 
      initialization. 

   -  NMS/VNTM triggering the creation of FA-LSP when computing the path 
      of client layer LSP. The path control models of PCE-VNTM 
      cooperation and NMS-VNTM cooperation (both integrated and separate 
      flavor) in [RFC5623] belong to this scenario. 

   In such case, the server layer selection and server layer selection 
   and path computation is performed by planning tool or NMS/PCE/VNTM or 
   the edge node. The signaling of client layer LSP and server layer FA-

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-h-lsp-mln-02.txt                   October 2010 


   LSP are separated. The normal LSP creation procedures ([RFC3471] and 
   [RFC3473]) are performed for these two LSPs and no new extension is 
   required. 

    

4.2. Model 2: Signaling trigger server layer path computation 

   In this model, the source node of client layer LSP only computes the 
   route in its layer network. When the signaling of the client layer 
   LSP reaches at the region edge node, the edge node performs server 
   layer FA-LSP path computation and then creates the FA-LSP. When PCE 
   is introduced to perform path computation in the multi-layer network, 
   this model is the same as the model of "Higher-layer signaling 
   trigger with Multiple PCE without inter-PCE" in [RFC5623]. 

   In such case, the edge node will receive a PATH message with a loose 
   ERO indicating an FA is requested, and may perform the server layer 
   selection (e.g., through the server layer PCE or the VNTM) and then 
   compute and set up the path of the FA-LSP. The signaling procedure of 
   client layer LSP and server layer FA-LSP is described detailedly in 
   [RFC4206] and [RFC4206bis]. 

   It's possible that the source node of the client layer LSP selects 
   the server layer SC and/or granularity when performing path 
   computation in the client layer, and requests or suggests the edge 
   node to use an appointed server layer to create the FA-LSP.  

   The XRO including SC sub-object ([MLN-EXT]) is adopted for the server 
   layer SC exclusion, which can be used indirectly to select server 
   layer SC. Such solution is not straightforward enough and further 
   more cannot be used for the server layer granularity selection. 
   Therefore, in this case, new extensions for server layer SC and 
   switching granularity selection are required. 

    

4.3. Model 3: Full path computation at source node 

   In this model, the source node of the client layer LSP performs a 
   full path computation including the client layer and the server layer 
   routes. The server layer FA-LSP creation is triggered at the edge 
   node by the client layer LSP signaling. When PCE is introduced to 
   perform path computation in the multi-layer network, this model is 
   the same as the model of "Higher-layer signaling trigger with Single 
   PCE" or "Higher-layer signaling trigger with Multiple PCE with inter-
   PCE" in [RFC5623].

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-h-lsp-mln-02.txt                   October 2010 


   In such case, the server layer selection and server layer path 
   computation is performed at the source node of the client layer LSP 
   (e.g., through VNTM or PCE), but not at the edge node.  

   In [RFC4206], the ERO which contains the list of nodes and links 
   (including the client layer and server layer) along the path is used 
   in the PATH message of the client layer LSP. The edge node can find 
   out the tail end of the FA-LSP based on the switching capability of 
   the node using the IGP database (see session 6.2 of [RFC 4206]). 

   Similar to the problem of model 2, the edge node is not aware of 
   which switching granularity to be selected for the FA-LSP because the 
   ERO and/or XRO do not contain such information. Therefore, the edge 
   node may not be able to create the FA-LSP, or may select another 
   switching granularity by itself which is different from the one 
   selected previously at the source node, which makes the creation of 
   hierarchy LSP out of control.  

   Therefore, new extensions for server layer SC and switching 
   granularity selection are also required in this model. 

    

5. ERO Sub-Object 

   In order to solve the problems described in the previous sessions, a 
   new sub-object named SERVER_LAYER_INFO sub-object is introduced in 
   this document, which is carried in the ERO and is used to indicate 
   which server layer to create the FA-LSP.  

   The SERVER_LAYER_INFO sub-object is put immediately behind the node 
   or link (interface) address sub-object, indicating the related node 
   is a region edge node on the LSP in the ERO.  

   The format of the SERVER_LAYER_INFO sub-object is shown below: 

    0                   1                   2                   3

   -  L bit: MUST be zero and MUST be ignored when received. 

   -  Type: The SERVER_LAYER_INFO sub-object has a type of xx (TBD). 

   -  Length: The total length of the sub-object in bytes, including the 
      Type and Length fields. The value of this field is always a 
      multiple of 4. 

   -  M (Mandatory) bit: When set, it means the edge node MUST set up 
      the FA-LSP in the appointed server layer; otherwise, the appointed 
      server layer is suggested and the edge node may select other 
      server layer by local policy. 

   -  LSP Encoding Type and Switching Type: These two fields are used to 
      point out which switching layer is requested to set up the FA-LSP. 
      The values of these two fields are inherited from the Generalized 
      Label Request in GMPLS signaling, referring to [RFC3471], [RFC3473] 
      and other related standards and drafts. Note that the G-PID of the 
      Server layer FA-LSP can be deduced from the type of client layer 
      LSP by these two fields. 

   -  Traffic Parameters: The traffic parameters field is used to 
      indicate the switching granularity of the FA-LSP. The format of 
      this field depends on the switching technology of the server layer 
      (which can be deduced from the LSP Encoding Type and Switching 
      Type fields in this sub-object) and is consistent with the 
      existing standards and drafts. For example, the Traffic Parameters 
      of Ethernet, SONET/SDH and OTN are defined by the [ETH-TP], 
      [RFC4606] and [OTN-ctrl] respectively.  

    

5.1. Application of SERVER_LAYER_INFO sub-object 

   When a node receives a PATH message containing ERO and finds that 
   there is a SERVER_LAYER_INFO sub-object immediately behind the node 
   or link address sub-object related to itself, the node determines 
   that it's a region edge node. Then, the edge node finds out the 
   server layer selection information from the sub-object: 

   -  Determine the switching layer by the LSP Encoding Type and 
      Switching Type fields; 

   -  Determine the switching granularity of the FA-LSP by the Traffic 
      Parameters field.

draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-h-lsp-mln-02.txt                   October 2010 


   The edge node MUST then determine the other edge of the region, i.e., 
   the tail end of the FA-LSP, with respect to the subsequence of hops 
   of the ERO. The node that satisfies the following conditions will be 
   treated as the tail end of the FA-LSP: 

   -  There is a SERVER_LAYER_INFO sub-object that immediately behind 
      the node or link address sub-object which is related to that node; 

   -  The LSP Encoding Type, Switching Type and the Traffic Parameters  
      fields of this SERVER_LAYER_INFO sub-object is the same as the 
      SERVER_LAYER_INFO sub-object corresponding to the head end; 

   -  The node is the first one that satisfies the two conditions above 
      in the subsequence of hops of the ERO. 

   If a match of tail end is found, the head end now has the clear 
   server layer information of the FA-LSP and then initiates an RSVP-TE 
   session to create the FA-LSP in the appointed server layer between 
   the head end and the tail end.
