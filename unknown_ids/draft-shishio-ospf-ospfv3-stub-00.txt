                      OSPFv3 Stub Router Advertisement
                      draft-shishio-ospf-ospfv3-stub-00

Abstract

 Open Shortest Path First for IPv6 has no transit capability,it is R-bit
 and V6-bit.
 The feature can avoid transit when the router does not ready to forward
 packets.This is very useful feature for operators.

 But Stub Router advertisment is very popular operation method on 
 Open Shortest Path First IPv4 enviroments.
 
 This document describe about OSPFv3 Stub Router Advertisemnt for easy 
 to operate OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 dual stack environments.

Internet-Draft       OSPFv3 Stub Router Advertisement               2010


1.  Motivation
  OSPF Stub Router Advertisement[RFC3137] describe when the operator  
  need this function.
      o  The router is in a critical condition (for example, has very
         high CPU load or does not have enough memory to store all LSAs
         or build the routing table).

      o  Graceful introduction and removal of the router to/from the
         network.

      o  Other (administrative or traffic engineering) reasons.
 Even if the network will be moved or migrated to IPv6 with OSPFv3
 [OSPFv3],but the motivation never change.
 

2.  OSPFv2 operation
 [RFC3137] described in section 2 in detail.
  Router X announce its Router LSA to the neighbor with costs of all 
  non-stub links are set to LSInfinity(0xFFFF).

 The operater will check interface metric of ospf database,if he would 
 like to confirm whether the router anounce LSInginity.
 
 Many operators are using [RFC3137] in OSPFv2.And a lot of venders 
 support this feature.
 Use cases are below;
 2.1 Wait for BGP when bootup.
 
 |R1|--|R2|---|R4|---internet
  |             |
  +----|R3|-----+
 R2 is best path for internet.
 When R2 reload,then R3 would be best for internet.
 R2 is bootup and OSPF converged,but BGP still not conveged.
 R1 should not send traffic to R3.
 So R2 sends LSInfinity(0xFFFF),R1 wait R2-R4's BGP converge.
 BGP converged,R2 sends correct metric value in OSPFv2 area.
 R2 back to primary path.
 
 2.2 LDP syncronization
 |R1|--|R2|---|R4|
  |             |
  +----|R3|-----+
 R2 is best path in this MPLS network.
 When R2 reload,then R3 would be best path.
 R2 is bootup and OSPF converged,but LDP not converged.
 R1 should not send traffic to R3.
 So R2 sends LSInfinity(0xFFFF),R1 wait R2 LDP converged.
 LDP converged,R2 sends correct metric value in OSPFv2 area.
 And OSPF and LDP converged.
 This operation is described in [LDP-Sync].

 2.3 Configuration change
 |R1|--|R2|---|R4|
  |             |
  +----|R3|-----+
 When operator needs R2 configuration change,R2 sends LSInfinity(0xFFFF)
 for traffic engineering.  
 R2 configuration completed,R2 sends correct metric value 
 in OSPFv2 area.
 
 
3.  OSPFv3 operation
 3.1  R-bit and v6-bit
  [RFC5340] explains section 2.7.
  If the "R-bit" is clear, an OSPF speaker can participate in OSPF 
  topology distribution without being used to forward transit traffic.
  The V6-bit specializes the R-bit; if the V6-bit is clear, an OSPF
  speaker can participate in OSPF topology distribution without
  being used to forward IPv6 datagrams.  If the R-bit is set and the
  V6-bit is clear, IPv6 datagrams are not forwarded but datagrams
  belonging to another protocol family may be forwarded.

  This protocol implementation is useful in multi address family 
  environment such as [OSPFv3 AF].
  Operetor have to check "R-bit" and "v6-bit" in this operations 
  not mettric.
  
  Also [RFC5340] described in  A.2.  The Options Field.
   
   R-bit
      This bit (the `Router' bit) indicates whether the originator is 
      an active router.  If the router bit is clear, then routes that
      transit the advertising node cannot be computed.  

  [RFC3137] is just maximum metric,the route is compted,
  but the worst.
  
 When R3 and R3's link failed in 2.3 Configuration change.
 R1 sends traffic to R2.
 But if R-bit clear,R1 can't sends traffic to R2.
 Because the route is not computed. 
 
 3.2.  OSPFv2 compatibility mode
  OSPFv3 has metric information of all of LSAs(except of Link-LSA.)
  So,the router can annouce set to LSInfinity(0xFFFF).
  This is simple implementation and operation.

   The technique described in this document does not introduce any new
   security issues into OSPF protocol.
