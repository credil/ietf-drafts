1. Introduction
  Many protocols of the Internet are used to transfer large amount of 
information which can be displayed at the receiver's computer only if 
required hardware is present or its configuration allow to do this. 
  Now if the receiver is not able to display the information, this 
information is being sent. This causes the overload of the network.
Using HCTP will solve this problem by preceding transfer of 
information about hadrware configuration of the client.


2. Review

2.2 Functional Description

  HCTP is used to request and transfer information about hardware
configuration of the computer. Moreover, it can be used like a
ping-tool by sending special types of messages.
  HCTP use packets to exchange information. Packets consist of header
and body.
  The format of packets is described by this document.
  Each side of the exchange mustn't open more than 256 connection
at the same time.

2.3 Modes of work

  HCTP has 3 modes of work:
   a) casual. If HCTP works in this mode, it just transfers the
information about hardware configuration.
   b) "If has". This mode allows to get known the fact of presence
of a device.
   c) trace. This mode is similar to ICMP Echo messages and is used
to check the availability of using HCTP.
  These modes will be described below more detalized.

2.4 Model of work
  HCTP is a client-server protocol. Each computer can be as server,
as client.
  A computer which requests information is a client. A computer which
answers the client is a server.
  After a server receives the HCTP request, it forms an answer and 
sends it to a client. Then a client should send Thank You Message
(TUm) in order a server close a transaction.
  While processing request some errors may occure. In this case a
server should send an Error Answer (EA). After receiving EA a client
may repeat the request.
  The information about requested hardware or errors is transfered
in the body.
  If the information is rerquested about the device which is not
present in the server's system, it should send EA with the
corresponding error code. In that case a client shouldn't repeat the 
request.
  HCTP trace messages can be used like ICMP Echo messages. Generally 
they are used to check if HCTP can be used. The text of body in HCTP 
trace request must be similar to the text in HCTP trace answer.

3.3 Error messages formation

  If an error occures while processing the request or a device 
is not present, the server should send the Error Answer (EA).
It is done by setting AT in 10 and putting the error code into 
the body of the packet.
  There are following error codes for HCTP:
100 - HCTP not used;
101 - it is restricted send information about this device;
102 - the requested device not present in the system;
103 - incorrect request;
104 - another error;
105-199 - reserved for future use.

4. IANA Considerations
 [TODO: IANA Considerations.]


5. Security Consiiderations.
  HCTP, as mentioned before, supports only 256 connection at the same
time on one of the side of exchange. It won't make possible DDoS
attacks using HCTP.
  Another security issues will be published in the next versions of this 
document.
