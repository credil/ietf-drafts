2.  Introduction

   "Multi-Topology Routing in OSPF", RFC4915, describes a mechanism for
   Open Shortest Path First protocol to support Multi-Topologies (MTs)
   in IP network where the Type of Service (TOS) based metric fields are
   redefined and are used to advertise different topologies, each with a
   separate link metric.  The classification of what type of traffic
   maps to which topology is not defined in RFC4915.  The interface can
   be configured to belong to a set of topologies.  Network topology
   changes will be advertised independently for each topology using a
   Multi-Topology Identifier (MT-ID), so that IP packets can be
   forwarded in the specific network topology independently.

   "M-ISIS: Multi Topology (MT) Routing in Intermediate System to
   Intermediate Systems (IS-ISs)", RFC5120, describes a mechanism within
   Intermediate System to Intermediate Systems (IS-ISs) to run a set of
   independent IP topologies.  The existing IS-IS protocol is extended
   so that the formation of adjacencies and advertising of prefixes and
   reachable intermediate system are performed independently within each
   topology.

   There is a need to support Multiple-Topologies in MPLS network where
   a label switch path (LSP) is established within one topology or
   across multiple topologies and the traffic can be forwarded along the
   LSP within each network topology or across multiple topologies.

   This document presents requirements for Multiprotocol Label Switching
   Multiple-Topology (MPLS-MT).  It identifies requirements that may
   apply to one or more individual approaches that a Service Provider
   may use to provision LSPs in MPLS-MT.  The specification of technical
   means to provide MPLS-MT services is outside the scope of this
   document.  Other documents are intended to cover this aspect.  This
   document is intended as a "checklist" of requirements, providing a
   consistent way to evaluate and document how well each approach
   satisfies specific requirements.  The applicability statement
   documents for each approach should provide the results of this
   evaluation.  This document is not intended to compare one approach to
   another.  This document presents requirements from several points of
   view.  It begins with some considerations from a point of view common
   to customers and service providers, continues with a customer
   perspective, and concludes with specific needs of a Service Provider
   (SP).

   There are three different deployment scenarios MPLS-MT services are
   considered in this document:

   1.  Single-provider, single-AS: This is the least complex scenario,
   where the MPLS-MT service is offered across a single service provider
   network spanning a single Autonomous System.

   2.  Single-provider, multi-AS: In this scenario, a single provider
   may have multiple Autonomous Systems (e.g., a global Tier-1 ISP with
   different ASes depending on the global location, or an ISP that has
   been created by mergers and acquisitions of multiple networks).  This
   scenario involves the constrained distribution of routing information
   across multiple Autonomous Systems.

   3.  Multi-provider: This scenario is the most complex, wherein trust
   negotiations need to be made across multiple service provider
   backbones in order to meet the security and service level agreements
   for the MPLS-MT customer.  This scenario can be generalized to cover
   the Internet, which comprises of multiple service provider networks.
   It should be noted that customers can construct their own MPLS-MTs
   across multiple providers.  However such MPLS-MTs are not considered
   here as they would not be "Providerprovisioned".

   MPLS-MT is set of extensions to existing MPLS signaling protocols
   that makes MPLS signaling protocols aware of multi-topology.  In the
   context of MPLS signaling the term "Multi-topology" is redefined to

   be protocol independent unlike IGP-MT, which is scoped inside a
   single flavor IGP (ex.  ISIS-MT or OSPF-MT).  In other words, a MPLS
   Multiple-Topologycan be mapped to a OSPFv2 based topology, OSPFv3
   based topology or ISIS based IGP topology.  Besides, a MPLS multi-
   topology can also be mapped to an instance of OSPF-MT or ISIS-MT.
   There are two major categories for MPLS-MT applications: a) MPLS
   RSVP-TE-MT applications, b) MPLS LDP-MT applications.  The following
   sections of the draft describe application scenarios and MPLS-MT
   signaling in general.  These application scenarios are useful for
   service providers who already have an MPLS network, or for service
   providers willing to migrate from IP to MPLS.

   The following Sections describe applicability and generic MPLS-MT
   requirements.


3.  Applicability

   There are two main scenarios for how MPLS-MT can be used as a value-
   adding tool: 1) It can be exposed to and used by the customer to suit
   particular needs.  For example, a customer might be given the option
   to select from a range of different topologies with different price
   and quality characteristics, and can select one (or more) that
   fulfils the given requirements.  This could allow a service provider
   to better exploit network resources, by using pricing as an
   incentive. 2) It can be used as a management tool by the network
   operator to achieve certain goals such as resilience, traffic
   isolation and congestion avoidance, without exposing this to
   customers.  Of course, one scenario does not exclude the other: an
   operator might want to offer MT routing to large customers, while
   also using it as a tool for "internal" purposes for its best effort
   services.

3.1.  Simplified Data-plane

   IGP-MT requires additional data-plane resources to maintain a
   separate forwarding table for each configured MT.  On the other hand,
   MPLS-MT does not change the data-plane system architecture, if an
   IGP-MT is mapped to an MPLS-MT.  In case MPLS-MT, the incoming label
   value itself can determine an MT, and hence it requires a single
   NHLFE space.  MPLS-MT requires only MT-RIBs in the control-plane, and
   there is no need to have extra MT-FIBs.  Forwarding IP packets over a
   particular MT requires either configuration or some external means at
   every node, to map an attribute of incoming IP packet header to
   IGP-MT, which is additional overhead for network management.  With
   MPLS-MT, mapping is required only at the ingress-PE of an MPLS-MT
   LSP, because each node identifies MPLS-MT LSP switching based on
   incoming label, hence no additional configuration is required at

Internet-Draft                   MPLS MT                      March 2011


   every node.

3.2.  Automation of inter-layer interworking

   With (G)MPLS-RSVP-MT extensions, an ingress-PE can signal a
   particular path (ERO) that can traverse different network layers to
   reach a egress-PE.  For instance, an ERO is associated with MT-ID
   RSVP subobject to indicate a "P" router to use a particular Layer-1
   TE- link-state topology, instead of the default Layer-3 link-state
   topology as illustrated in the following diagram.  With this
   mechanism a (G)MPLS-TE LSP can be offloaded to lower layers without
   service disruption and without complexity of configuration.

    nodes requires some auto-discovery mechanism.

3.3.  Migration without service disruption

   As stated above, MPLS-MT abstracts link state topology and identifies
   it by a unique MT-ID, which need not be the same as the IGP-MT ID.
   This characteristic is quite useful for service providers looking to
   migrate to a different flavor of IGP, e.g., OSPFv2 to ISIS6, OSPFv2
   to OSPFv3.  Service providers would like to incrementally upgrade
   their topologies, which requires an LSP to traverse multiple IGP



Li, et al.             Expires September 15, 2011               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                   MPLS MT                      March 2011


   domains (OSPFv2 to OSPFv3) or (OSPF to ISIS).  Migrating TE-LSPs to
   use a newly deployed link state topology requires a non-trivial
   effort.  This migration may involve service disruption, especially
   when a path includes loose-hops in the ERO.  For example: When an
   incoming PATH message requires an LSR to resolve loose-hop over a
   newly deployed IGP domain, which is not possible in the absence of
   MPLS-MT signaling.  MPLS-MT allows an ingress-PE to specify Multiple-
   Topology to be used at every hop.

3.4.  Protection using MT

   We know that [IP-FRR-MT] can be used for configuring alternate paths
   via backup-mt, such that if the primary link fails, then a backup-MT
   can be used for forwarding.  However, such techniques require special
   marking of IP packets that are forwarded using backup-MTs.
   MPLS-LDP-MT procedures simplify the forwarding of the MPLS packets
   over backup-MTs, as the MPLS-LDP-MT procedure distributes separate
   labels for each MT.  How backup paths are computed depends on the
   implementation, and the algorithm.  MPLS-RSVP-MT in conjunction with
   IGP-MT could be used to separate the primary traffic and backup
   traffic.  For example, service providers can create a backup MT that
   consists of links that are meant only for backup traffic.  Service
   providers can then establish bypass LSPs, standby LSPs, using backup
   MT, thus keeping undeterministic backup traffic away from the primary
   traffic.

   Another case is for mLDP.  Since mLDP is based on IGP, in a same
   topology(or AS), when a backup mLDP is construct, it is diffult for
   the backup mLDP to find physical links different from those in the
   primary mLDP.  With MPLS MT, the primary mLDP and backup mLDP can be
   construct in different topology with differnt links.  So it is quite
   easy to set up primary and secondary mLDP with differnt links.

3.5.  Service Separation

   MPLS-MT procedures allow establishing two distinct LSPs for the same
   FEC, by advertising a separate label mapping for each configured
   topology.  Service providers can implement CoS using MPLS-MT
   procedures without requiring to create a separate FEC address for
   each class.  MPLS-MT can also be used to separate multicast and
   unicast traffic.

3.6.  Load Balancing

   MPLS-MT can be used to construct several alternative LSPs between PE
   routers.  The LSPs in different topologies might follow partly
   overlapping routes through the network, or be completely disjoint.
   By smart assignment traffic to different MTs at the PE routers, it is

Internet-Draft                   MPLS MT                      March 2011


   possible to offload traffic from heavily loaded links, and hence
   reduce the risk of congestion and improve resource utilization.  This
   type of load balancing can be performed either in an offline way,
   where traffic is assigned to each MT according to a static split
   ratio, or in an online fashion, where the amount of traffic assigned
   to each MT according to a dynamic splitting function that depends on
   the current load situation.

3.7.  Inter-domain MPLS-TE and MPLS VPN

   Without MPLS MT, when a MPLS-TE tunnel is to be construct across
   multiple AS, PCE function has to be supported in each router in the
   MPLS-TE tunnel.  With MPLS MT, routers in different ASs can be
   included into a new AS.  In this way, MPLS-TE tunnels can be easily
   set up.

   MPLS VPNs can be constructed across differnet ASs.  In some case,
   when there are multiple ASs, it is quite difficult to manage the
   inter-as MPLS VPN.  With MPLS MT, all the PEs can be configured in a
   singe AS, so the MPLS VPN can be constructed and managed easily.


4.  Service requirements

   These are the requirements that a customer can observe or measure for
   verifying whether the MPLS-MT service that the Service Provider (SP)
   provides is satisfactory.  As mentioned before, each of these
   requirements apply equally across each of the three deployment
   scenarios unless stated otherwise.

4.1.  Availability

   MPLS-MT services MUST have high availability.  LSPs that cross over
   several MTs require connectivity to be maintained even in the event
   of network failures.

   This can be achieved via various redundancy techniques such as:

4.1.1.  Physical Diversity and FRR

   A single MT router may be connected to multiple MT routers.  For a
   LSP, both local protections and global protections can be set up.
   Thus when a network failure happens, the traffic carried by the LSP
   can continue to flow across the MTs from the head end of the LSP to
   the tail ends of the LSP.

   It should be noted that it is difficult to guarantee high
   availability when the MPLS-MT service is across multiple providers,



Li, et al.             Expires September 15, 2011               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                   MPLS MT                      March 2011


   unless there is a negotiation between the different service providers
   to maintain the service level agreement for the MPLS-MT customer.

4.2.  Stability

   In addition to availability, MPLS-MT services MUST also be stable.
   Stability is a function of several components such as MT routing and
   MPLS-MT signaling.  For example, in the case of MT routing, route
   flapping or routing loops MUST be avoided in order to ensure
   stability.  Stability of the MPLS-MT service is directly related to
   the stability of the mechanisms and protocols used to establish LSPs.
   It SHOULD also be possible to allow network upgrades and maintenance
   procedures without impacting the MPLS-MT service.

4.3.  Traffic types

   MPLS-MT services MUST support unicast (or point to point) traffic and
   SHOULD support multicast (or point-to-multipoint) traffic.  For
   multicast traffic, the network delivers a stream to a set of
   destinations that have registered interest in the stream through a
   P2MP LSP.  It is desirable to support multicast limited in scope to
   an intranet or extranet.  The solution SHOULD be able to support a
   large number of such intranet or extranet specific multicast groups
   in a scalable manner.  All MPLS-MT approaches SHALL support both IPv4
   and IPv6 traffic.

4.4.  Data isolation

   The MPLS-MT MUST support forwarding plane isolation.  The network
   MUST never deliver user data across MPLS-MT boundaries unless the two
   MPLS-MTs participate in an intranet or extranet.

   Furthermore, if the provider network receives signaling or routing
   information from one MPLS-MT, it MUST NOT reveal that information to
   another MPLS-MT unless the two MPLS-MTs participate in an intranet or
   extranet.  It should be noted that the disclosure of any signaling/
   routing information across an extranet MUST be filtered per the
   extranet agreement between the organizations participating in the
   extranet.

4.5.  Security

   A range of security features SHOULD be supported by the suite of
   MPLS-MT solutions in the form of securing customer flows, providing
   authentication services for temporary, remote or mobile users, and
   the need to protect service provider resources involved in supporting
   a MPLS-MT.  Each MPLS-MT solution SHOULD state which security
   features it supports and how such features can be configured on a per

   customer basis.  Protection against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
   is a key component of security mechanisms.

   Some security mechanisms may be equally useful regardless of the
   scope of the MPLS-MT.  Other mechanisms may be more applicable in
   some scopes than in others.  For example, in some cases of single
   -provider single-AS MPLS-MTs, the MPLS-MT service may be isolated
   from some forms of attack by isolating the infrastructure used for
   supporting MPLS-MTs from the infrastructure used for other services.
   However, the requirements for security are common regardless of the
   scope of the MPLS-MT service.

4.5.1.  User data security

   MPLS-MT solutions that support user data security SHOULD use standard
   methods to achieve confidentiality, integrity, authentication and
   replay attack prevention.  Such security methods MUST be configurable
   between different end points.  It is also desirable to configure
   security on a per-LSP basis.  User data security using encryption is
   especially desirable in the multi-provider scenario.

4.5.2.  Access control

   A MPLS-MT solution may also have the ability to activate the
   appropriate filtering capabilities upon request of a customer.  A
   filter provides a mechanism so that access control can be invoked at
   the point(s) of communication between different organizations
   involved in an extranet.  Access control can be implemented by a
   firewall, access control lists on routers, cryptographic mechanisms
   or similar mechanisms to apply policy-based access control.  Such
   access control mechanisms are desirable in the multi-provider
   scenario.

4.5.3.  MT router authentication and authorization

   A MPLS-MT solution requires authentication and authorization of the
   following:

   1. temporary and permanent access for users connecting to a MT router
   (authentication and authorization BY the MT router)

   2. the MT router itself (authentication and authorization FOR the MT
   router)

4.5.4.  Inter domain security

   The MPLS-MT solution MUST have appropriate security mechanisms to
   prevent the different kinds of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)



Li, et al.             Expires September 15, 2011              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                   MPLS MT                      March 2011


   attacks, misconfiguration or unauthorized accesses in inter domain
   MPLS-MT connections.  This is particularly important for multiservice
   provider deployment scenarios.  However, this will also be important
   in single-provider multi-AS scenarios.

4.6.  Topology

   An MPLS-MT implementation SHOULD support arbitrary, customer -defined
   connectivity to the extent possible, for example, from partial mesh
   to full mesh topology.  These can actually be different from the
   topology used by the service provider.  The MPLS-MT services SHOULD
   be independent of MPLS-MT technology.  To the extent possible, a
   MPLS-MT service SHOULD be independent of the geographic extent of the
   deployment.  Multiple MPLS-MTs per customer SHOULD be supported
   without requiring additional hardware resources.

4.7.  Addressing

   Each customer resource MUST be identified by an address that is
   unique within its MPLS-MT.  It need not be identified by a globally
   unique address.  Support for private addresses as described in
   [RFC1918], as well as overlapping customer addresses SHALL be
   supported.  One or more MPLS-MTs for each customer can be built over
   the same infrastructure without requiring any of them to renumber.
   The solution MUST NOT use NAT on the customer traffic to achieve that
   goal.  Interconnection of two networks with overlapping IP addresses
   is outside the scope of this document.

4.8.  Quality of Service

   A technical approach for supporting MPLS-MTs SHALL be able to support
   QoS via IETF standardized mechanisms such as Diffserv.  Support for
   best-effort traffic SHALL be mandatory for all MPLS-MT types.  The
   extent to which any specific MPLS-MT service will support QoS is up
   to the service provider.  In many cases single -provider single-AS
   MPLS-MTs will offer QoS guarantees.  Support of QoS guarantees in the
   multiservice- provider case will require cooperation between the
   various service providers involved in offering the service.

4.9.  Network Resource Partitioning and Sharing between MPLS-MTs
      (REWRITE with emphasis/focus on partition)

   Network resources such as memory space, FIB table, bandwidth and CPU
   processing SHALL be shared between MPLS-MTs and, where applicable,
   with non-MPLS-MT Internet traffic.  Mechanisms SHOULD be provided to
   prevent any specific MPLS-MT from taking up available network
   resources and causing others to fail.  SLAs to this effect SHOULD be
   provided to the customer.  Similarly, resources used for control



Li, et al.             Expires September 15, 2011              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                   MPLS MT                      March 2011


   plane mechanisms are also shared.  When the service provider's
   control plane is used to distribute MPLS -MT specific information and
   provide other control mechanisms for MPLS-MTs, there SHALL be
   mechanisms to ensure that control plane performance is not degraded
   below acceptable limits when scaling the MPLS-MT service, or during
   network events such as failure, routing instabilities etc.  Since a
   service provider's network would also be used to provide Internet
   service, in addition to MPLS-MTs, mechanisms to ensure the stable
   operation of Internet services and other MPLS-MTs SHALL be made in
   order to avoid adverse effects of resource hogging by large MPLS-MT
   customers.


5.  Provider requirements

   This section describes operational requirements for a cost
   -effective, profitable MPLS-MT service offering.

5.1.  Scalability

   The scalability for MPLS-MT solutions has many aspects.  The list
   below is intended to comprise of the aspects that MPLS-MT solutions
   SHOULD address.  Clearly these aspects in absolute figures are very
   different for different types of MPLS -MTs.  It is also important to
   verify that MPLS-MT solutions not only scales on the high end, but
   also on the low end - i.e., a MPLS-MT with three nodes and three
   users should be as viable as a MPLS-MT with hundreds of nodes and
   thousands of users.

5.1.1.  Service Provider Capacity Sizing Projections

   A MPLS-MT solution SHOULD be scalable to support a large number of
   MPLS-MTs per Service Provider network.

   A MPLS-MT solution SHOULD be scalable to support of a large number of
   routes per MPLS-MT.  The number of routes per MPLS-MT may range from
   just a few to (O(10^5)) exchanged between ISPs, with typical values
   being in the O(10^3) range.  The high end number is especially true
   considering the fact that many large ISPs may provide MPLS-MT
   services to smaller ISPs or large corporations.

   A MPLS-MT solution SHOULD support high values of the frequency of
   configuration setup and change.  Approaches SHOULD articulate scaling
   and performance limits for more complex deployment scenarios, such as
   single-provider multi-AS MPLS-MTs, multi -provider MPLS-MTs.
   Approaches SHOULD also describe other dimensions of interest, such as
   capacity requirements or limits, number of interworking instances
   supported as well as any scalability implications on management



Li, et al.             Expires September 15, 2011              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                   MPLS MT                      March 2011


   systems.  A MPLS-MT solution SHOULD support a large number of
   customer interfaces on a single PE or CE with current Internet
   protocols.

5.1.2.  MPLS-MT Scalability aspects

   This section describes the metrics for scaling MPLS-MT solutions.
   These numbers are only representative and different service providers
   may have different requirements for scaling.  Further discussion on
   service provider sizing projections is in Section 5.1.1.  It should
   also be noted that the numbers given below would be different
   depending on whether the scope of the MPLS-MT is single-provider
   single-AS, single-provider multi-AS, or multiprovider.  Clearly, the
   larger the scope, the larger the numbers that may need to be
   supported.  However, this also means more management issues.  The
   numbers below may be treated as representative of the single-provider
   case.

5.1.3.  Number of MPLS-MTs in the network

   The number of MPLS-MTs SHOULD scale linearly with the size of the
   access network and with the number of PEs.  The number of MPLS-MTs in
   the network SHOULD be O(10).  This requirement also effectively
   places a requirement on the number of tunnels that SHOULD be
   supported in the network.

5.1.4.  Number of MPLS-MTs per customer

   In some cases a service provider may support multiple MPLS-MTs for
   the same customer of that service provider.  For example, this may
   occur due to differences in services offered per MPLS-MT (e.g.,
   different QoS, security levels, or reachability) as well as due to
   the presence of multiple workgroups per customer.  It is possible
   that one customer will run up to O(10) MPLS-MTs.

5.1.5.  Number of addresses and address prefixes per MPLS-MT

   Since any MPLS-MT solution SHALL support private customer addresses,
   the number of addresses and address prefixes are important in
   evaluating the scaling requirements.  The number of address prefixes
   used in routing protocols and in forwarding tables specific to the
   MPLS-MT needs to scale from very few (for smaller customers) to very
   large numbers seen in typical Service Provider backbones.  The high
   end is especially true considering that many Tier 1 SPs may provide
   MPLS-MT services to Tier 2 SPs or to large corporations.  This number
   would be on the order of addresses supported in typical native
   backbones.

5.1.6.  Solution-Specific Metrics

   Each MPLS-MT solution SHALL document its scalability characteristics
   in quantitative terms.  A MPLS-MT solution SHOULD quantify the amount
   of state that a PE and P device has to support.  This SHOULD be
   stated in terms of the order of magnitude of the number of MPLS-MTs
   supported by the service provider.

5.2.  Management

   A service provider MUST have a means to view the topology,
   operational state, service order status, and other parameters
   associated with each customer's MPLS-MT.  Furthermore, the service
   provider MUST have a means to view the underlying logical and
   physical topology, operational state, provisioning status, and other
   parameters associated with the equipment providing the MPLS -MT
   service(s) to its customers.

   In the multi-provider scenario, it is unlikely that participating
   providers would provide each other a view to the network topology and
   other parameters mentioned above.  However, each provider MUST ensure
   via management of their own networks that the overall MPLS -MT
   service offered to the customers are properly managed.  In general
   the support of a single MPLS-MT spanning multiple service providers
   requires close cooperation between the service providers.  One aspect
   of this cooperation involves agreement on what information about the
   MPLS-MT will be visible across providers, and what network management
   protocols will be used between providers.  MPLS-MT devices SHOULD
   provide standards-based management interfaces wherever feasible.

5.3.  Customer Management of a MPLS-MT

   A customer SHOULD have a means to view the topology, operational
   state, service order status, and other parameters associated with his
   or her MPLS-MT.

   A customer SHOULD be able to make dynamic requests for changes to
   traffic parameters.  A customer SHOULD be able to receive real-time
   response from the SP network in response to these requests.  One
   example of such service is a "Dynamic Bandwidth management"
   capability, that enables real-time response to customer requests for
   changes of allocated bandwidth allocated to their MPLS-MT(s).  A
   possible outcome of giving customers such capabilities is Denial of
   Service attacks on other MPLS-MT customers or Internet users.  This
   possibility is documented in the Security Considerations section.

6.  Engineering requirements

   These requirements are driven by implementation characteristics that
   make service and provider requirements achievable.

6.1.  Forwarding plane requirements

   The SP is REQUIRED to provide per-MPLS-MT management, tunnel
   maintenance and other maintenance required in order to meet the SLA/
   SLS.

   By definition, MPLS-MT traffic SHOULD be segregated from each other,
   and from non-MPLS-MT traffic in the network.  After all, MPLS-MTs are
   a means of dividing a physical network into several logical or
   physical networks.  MPLS-MT traffic separation SHOULD be done in a
   scalable fashion.  However, safeguards SHOULD be made available
   against misbehaving MPLS-MTs to not affect the network and other
   MPLS-MTs.

   A MPLS-MT solution SHOULD NOT impose any hard limit on the number of
   MPLS-MTs provided in the network.

6.2.  Control plane requirements

   The plug and play feature of a MPLS-MT solution with minimum
   configuration requirements is an important consideration.  The
   MPLS-MT solutions SHOULD have mechanisms for protection against
   customer interface and/or routing instabilities so that they do not
   impact other customers' services or impact general Internet traffic
   handling in any way.

   A MPLS-MT SHOULD be provisioned with minimum number of steps.  For
   this to be accomplished, an auto-configuration and an auto-discovery
   protocol, which SHOULD be as common as possible to all MPLS-MT
   solutions, SHOULD be defined.  However, these mechanisms SHOULD NOT
   adversely affect the cost, scalability or stability of a service by
   being overly complex, or by increasing layers in the protocol stack.

   Mechanisms to protect the SP network from effects of misconfiguration
   of MPLS-MTs SHOULD be provided.  This is especially of importance in
   the multi-provider case, where misconfiguration could possibly impact
   more than one network.

6.3.  Control Plane Containment

   The MPLS-MT control plane MUST include a mechanism through which the
   service provider can filter MPLS-MT related control plane information
   as it passes between Autonomous Systems.  For example, if a service



Li, et al.             Expires September 15, 2011              [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                   MPLS MT                      March 2011


   provider supports a MPLS-MT offering, but the service provider's
   neighbors do not participate in that offering, the service provider
   SHOULD NOT leak MPLS-MT control information into neighboring
   networks.  Neighboring networks MUST be equipped with mechanisms that
   filter this information should the service provider leak it.  This is
   important in the case of multi-provider MPLS-MTs as well as
   singleprovider multi-AS MPLS-MTs.

6.4.  Requirements for commonality of MPLS-MT mechanisms

   The mechanisms used to establish a MPLS-MT service SHOULD re-use
   well-known IETF protocols as much as possible.  It should, however,
   be noted that the use of Internet mechanisms for the establishment
   and running of an Internet-based MPLS-MT service, SHALL NOT affect
   the stability, robustness, and scalability of the Internet or
   Internet services.  In other words, these mechanisms SHOULD NOT
   conflict with the architectural principles of the Internet, nor
   SHOULD it put at risk the existing Internet systems.

   In addition to commonality with generic Internet mechanisms,
   infrastructure mechanisms used in different MPLS-MT solutions SHOULD
   be as common as possible.

6.5.  Interoperability

   Each technical solution is expected to be based on interoperable
   Internet standards.

   Multi-vendor interoperability at network element, network and service
   levels among different implementations of the same technical solution
   SHOULD be ensured (that will likely rely on the completeness of the
   corresponding standard).  This is a central requirement for SPs and
   customers.

   The technical solution MUST be multi-vendor interoperable not only
   within the SP network infrastructure, but also with the customer's
   network equipment and services making usage of the MPLS-MT service.

   Inter-domain interoperability - It SHOULD be possible to deploy a
   MPLS-MT solution across domains, Autonomous Systems, or the Internet.
