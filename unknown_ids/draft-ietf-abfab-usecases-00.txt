 Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond web (ABFAB) Use Cases
                      draft-ietf-abfab-usecases-00

Abstract

   Federated authentication is most commonly associated with Web-based
   services, but there is growing interest in the application of
   federated authentication for non-Web services.  The goal of this
   document is to drive the development of requirements.

1.  Introduction

   Federated identity facilitates the controlled sharing of information
   about principals, commonly across organisational boundaries.  This
   avoids redundant registration of principals who operate in multiple
   domains, reducing administrative overheads and improving usability
   while addressing privacy-related concerns and regulatory and
   statutory requirements of some jurisdictions.

   This information may include authentication state that a consumer can
   use, for example, to make access management decisions.  A number of
   mechanisms support the transmission of this information for Web-based
   scenarios (see, for example [OASIS.saml-profiles-2.0-os]), but there
   is interest in the application of federated identity in non-Web use
   cases.  This document describes some of these.

3.  Context of Use Cases

   The use cases described in the present document are a result of work
   led by JANET(UK), the operator of the United Kingdom's education and
   research network, responding to requirements from that particular
   community.

   In the interest of promoting the development of technology of broad
   applicability, the present authors welcome use cases and requirements
   from other sectors and communities.

4.  Use Cases

4.1.  Cloud Services

   Many organisations are seeking to deliver services to their users
   using 'Cloud'-based providers.  This is typically motivated by a
   desire to avoid management and operation of commodity services which,
   through economies of scale and so forth, can often be delivered more
   efficiently by such providers.

   Many providers already provide web-based access using conventional
   federated authentication mechanisms; for example, to 'web-mail'
   applications.  The use of federated authentication enables
   organisations that consume cloud services to more efficiently
   orchestrate the delivery of these services to their users.

   Frequently, however, users will prefer to use desktop applications

   that do not use Web protocols.  For example, a desktop email client
   may use a variety of non-Web protocols including SMTP, IMAP and POP.
   Some cloud providers support access to their services using non-Web
   protocols.  However, the authentication mechanisms used by these
   protocols will typically require that the provider has access to the
   user's credentials.  Consequently, the provider will require that
   users' credentials are regularly synchronised from the user
   organisation to the provider, which may have obvious implications for
   security and privacy, or else be provisioned directly by the
   provider.

   The latter approach may be acceptable in the case where an
   organisation has relationships with only a small number of providers,
   but may become untenable if an organisation obtains services from
   many providers.  Consequently organisation with a requirement to use
   non-Web protocols would prefer to make use of the credentials that
   they have already provisioned their users with, and to utilise
   federated authentication with non-Web protocols to obtain access to
   Cloud providers.

4.2.  High Performance Computing

   High-performance computing (HPC) uses supercomputers and computer
   clusters to solve complex computation problems most commonly
   associated with scientific research or computational science.

   Access to HPC resources is typicaly managed through the use of user
   digital certificates.  This requires HPC operators to issue
   certificates to users using a registration process that often
   duplicates identity management processes that already exist within
   most user organisations.  The HPC community would like to utilise
   federated identity to perform both the user registration and
   authentication functions required to use HPC resources, and so reduce
   costs by avoiding this duplication of effort.

   The HPC community also have following additional requirements:

   o  Improved Business Continuity: In the event of operational issues
      at an HPC system at one organisation (for example, a power
      failure), users and jobs could be transparently moved to other HPC
      systems.

   o  Establish HPC-as-a-service: Many organisations who have invested
      in HPC systems want to make their systems easily available to
      external customers.  Federated authentication facilitates this by
      enabling these customers to use their existing identity
      management, user credentialing and support processes.

   o  Improve the user experience: Authentication to HPC systems is
      normally performed using user digital certificates, which some
      users find difficult to use.  Federated authentication can provide
      a better user experience by allowing the use of other types of
      credentials, without requiring technical modifications to the HPC
      system to support these.

4.3.  Grid Infrastructure

   Grids are large-scale distributed infrastructures, consisting of many
   loosely coupled, independently managed, and geographically
   distributed resources managed by organizationally independent
   providers.  Users of grids utilize these resources using grid
   middleware that allows them to submit and control computing jobs,
   manipulate datasets, communicate with other users, etc.  These users
   are organized into Virtual Organizations (VOs); each VO represents a
   group of people working collaboratively on a common project.  VOs
   facilitate both the management of its users and the meditation of
   agreements between its users and resource providers.

   Authentication and authorisation within most grids is performed using
   a Public Key Infrastructure, requiring each user to have an X.509
   public-key certificate.  Authentication is performed through
   ownership of a particular certificate, while authorization decisions
   are made based on the user's identity (derived from their X.509
   certificate), membership of a particular VO, or additional
   information assigned to a user by a VO.  While efficient and
   scalable, this approach has been found wanting in terms of usability
   - many users find certificates difficult to manage, for various
   reasons.

   One approach to ameliorating this issue, adopted to some extent by
   some grid communities already, is to abstract away direct access to
   certificates from users, instead using alternative authentication
   mechanisms and then converting the credential provided by these into
   standard grid certificates.  Some implementations of this idea use
   existing federated authentication techniques.  However, current
   implementations of this approach suffer from a number of problems,
   not the least of which is the inability to use the federated
   credentials used to authenticate to a credential-conversion portal to
   also directly authenticate to non-web resources such as secure shell
   daemons.

   The ability to use federated authentication directly, without the use
   of a credential conversion service, would allow users to authenticate
   to a grid and its associated services, allowing them to directly
   launch and control computing jobs, all without having to manage, or
   even see, an X.509 public-key certificate at any point in the

   process.  Authorization within the grid would still be performed
   using VO membership asserted issued by the user's identity provider
   through the federated transport.
