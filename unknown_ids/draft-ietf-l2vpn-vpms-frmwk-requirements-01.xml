		<section title="Introduction">

			<section title="Problem Statement">
				<t>
					<xref target="RFC4664"/> describes different types of
					Provider Provisioned Layer 2 VPNs (L2 PPVPNs, or L2VPNs).
					Some of them are widely deployed today, such as
					Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) and
					Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS).
					A VPWS is a VPN service that supplies a
					Layer 2 (L2) point-to-point service.
					A VPLS is an L2 service that emulates Ethernet LAN service across
					a Wide Area Network (WAN).  
				</t>

				<t>
					For some use cases described hereafter, there are
					P2MP (point-to-multipoint) type services for Layer 2 
					traffic.  However, there is no straightforward way to realize them
					based on the existing L2VPN specifications.
				</t>

				<t>
					In a VPWS, a SP can set up point-to-point connectivity
					per a pair of
					CEs but it is not possible to replicate traffic
					for point-to-multipoint
					services in the SP's network side.  A SP could build
					multiple Pseudowires (PWs) independently and have the CEs replicate traffic over
					them, but this is not only inconvenient for the customer, it’s a
					waste of bandwidth resources.

				</t>

				<t>
					   In a VPLS, SPs can natively offer multipoint connectivity across
					   their backbone.  Although it is seemingly applicable for point-to-
					   multipoint service as well, there remains extra complexity for SPs to
					   filter unnecessary traffic between irrelevant sites (i.e., from a
					   receiver PE to another receiver PE) because VPLS provides
					   multipoint-to-multipoint connectivity between CEs.  Moreover, VPLS's
					   MAC-based learning/forwarding operation is unnecessary for
					   some scenarios particularly if customers only need simple
					   unidirectional point-to-multipoint service, or if they require non-
					   Ethernet Layer 2 connectivity.
				</t>

				<t>
					Consequently, there is a real need for a solution
					that natively provides point-to-multipoint service in L2VPN.
				</t>
			</section>

			<section title="Scope of This Document">
				<t>
					  VPMS is defined as a Layer 2 service that provides point-to-
					   multipoint connectivity for a variety of Layer2 link layers across an
					   IP or MPLS-enabled PSN.  VPMS is categorized as a class of provider-
					   provisioned Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPN).

				</t>

				<t>
					This document introduces a new service framework, reference
					model and functional requirements for
					VPMS by extending the existing
					framework <xref target="RFC4664"/> and requirements
					<xref target="RFC4665"/> for L2VPNs.
				</t>

				<t>
					The technical specifications are outside the scope of this
					document. There is no intent to specify
					solution-specific details.

					This document provides requirements from both the Service Provider's

		<section title="Use Cases">
			<section title="Ethernet Use Case">
				<t>
					For multicast traffic delivery, there is a requirement to deliver a
					   unidirectional P2MP service in addition to the existing P2P service.
					   The demand is growing to provide private (P2MP native Ethernet) services, for various applications such as IP-
					   based delivery of TV broadcasting, content delivery networks, etc.
					   Moreover, many digital audio/video devices (e.g., MPEG-TS, HD-SDI)
					   that supports Ethernet interfaces are becoming available, which will
					   make Ethernet P2MP service more common.  Also there are some
					   applications that naturally suited to static transport of VPMS.  For
					   example, MPEG-TS/IP/ Ethernet in DVB-H is typically static broadcast
					   without any signaling in the upstream direction.  VPMS could be a
					   possible solution to provide these kinds of networking connectivity
					   over PSNs.
				</t>

				<t>
				   Currently VPLS <xref target="RFC4761"/><xref target="RFC4762"/>
					is able to give P2MP-type
				   replication for Ethernet traffic.  Native VPLS already supports this
				   capability via a full mesh of PWs, and an extension to optimize
				   replication is also proposed [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mcast] as an
				   additional feature. However, VPLS by nature requires MAC-based
				   learning and forwarding, which might not be needed in some cases by
				   particular users.  Generally, video distribution applications use unidirectional P2MP traffic, but may not always require any added
				   complexity of MAC address management.  In addition, VPLS is a service
				   that essentially provides any-to-any connectivity between all CEs in
				   a L2VPN as it emulates a LAN service. 
				    However, if only P2MP connectivity is required, the traffic between leaves
				    is not allowed. It might require extra efforts to guarantee this behavior
				    in VPLS.  And in some P2MP scenarios there no traffic from leafs to root.
				    In these cases, VPMS is a service that provides much simpler
				    operation.
				</t>
				<t>
					   Note that VPMS provides single coverage of receiver membership; that
					   is, there is no distinct differentiation for multiple multicast
					   groups.  All traffic from a particular Attachment Circuit (AC) will
					   be forwarded toward the same remote receivers, even if the destination MAC
					   address is changed.  Basically in VPMS, destination MAC addresses are
					   not used for forwarding, which is significantly different from VPLS.
					   If MAC-based forwarding is preferred (i.e., multicast/unicast
					   differentiation of MAC address), VPLS should be chosen rather than
					   VPMS.
				</t>


			</section>


			<section title="ATM-based Use Case">
				<t>
					A use case of ATM-based service in VPMS could be to offer the
					capability for 
					service providers to support IP multicast wholesale services over
					ATM
					in case the wholesale customer relies on ATM infrastructure. The 
					P2MP support alleviates the constraint in terms of replication for ATM to 
					support IP multicast services. 
				</t>
				<t>
					   Another use case of VPMS for ATM is for audio/video stream
					   applications.  Today many digital TV broadcasting networks adopt ATM-
					   based distribution systems with point-to-multipoint PVPs/PVCs.  The
					   transport network supports replicating ATM cells in transit nodes to
					   efficiently deliver programs to multiple terminals.  For migrating
					   such ATM-based networks onto IP/MPLS-based networks, VPMS is considered to be
					   a candidate solution.
				</t>
			</section>


			<section title="TDM-based Use Case">
				<t>
					   Today the existing VPWS already supports TDM emulation services
					   (SAToP, CESoPSN or TDMoIP).  It is a Layer 1 service, not Layer 2
					   service; however, a common architecture is being used since they are
					   all packet-based emulations over a SP's network.  VPMS is also considered to be a solution for such TDM applications that require
					   point-to-multipoint topology.
				</t>

				<t>
						One use case is
						TDM-based multicast video delivery.  That is, data duplication
						is simply provided by Layer 1, without using upper layer's multicast protocols.
				</t>


				<t>
					   A second use case is TDM clock distribution scenario.
						 In a PSN environment, the existing VPWS allows support for 2G/3G
					   mobile backhauling (e.g.  TDM traffic for GSM's Abis interface, ATM
					   traffic for Release 99 UMTS's Iub interface).  Currently, the
					   Mobile backhauling architecture is always built as a star topology
					   between the 2G/3G controller (e.g.  BSC or RNC) and the 2G/3G Base
					   Stations (BTS or NodeB).  VPWS (P2P service) can be used
					   between each Base Station and their corresponding controller,
					   nothing more is required.
				</t>
				<t>
					   As far as synchronization in a PSN environment is concerned,
					   different mechanisms are being considered to provide frequency and phase
					   synchronization required in the 2G/3G Mobile environment to guarantee mobile
					   handover and strict QoS.  One mechanism consists of using Adaptive
					   Clock Distribution and Recovery.  With this method a Master element
					   distributes a reference clock frequency at protocol level by regularly sending
					   TDM PW packets (SAToP, CESoPSN or TDMoIP) to Slave elements.  This
					   process is based on the fact that the volume of transmitted data
					   arrival is considered as an indication of the source frequency that
					   could be used by the Slave element to recover the source clock
					   frequency.  With the current methods, the PE connected
					   to the Master must setup and maintain as many VPWS (P2P) as there are
					   Slave elements, and the Master has to replicate the traffic.  A
					   more efficient solution to deliver the clock frequency would be to use a VPMS
					   which supports P2MP traffic.  This would scale better than P2P
					   services (VPWS) with regards to the forwarding plane at the Master
					   since the traffic is no longer needs to be replicated to individual VPWSes (P2P),
					   only a single copy needs to be sent on the AC associated to the VPMS (P2MP).
					   Also, it may ease the
					   provisioning process since only one source endpoint needs to be
					   configured at the Ingress PE.  This provisioning process
					   would simplify the introduction of new Base
					   Stations.  The most significant gain of using VPMS would be that it avoids
					   replication on the Master
					   and hence saves bandwidth consumption by the synchronization traffic
					   which typically requires the highest level of QoS.  This type of
					   traffic will be competing with equivalent QoS traffic like VoIP, which
					   is why it is critical to be able to efficiently use the bandwidth.

			<t>
				A VPMS instance is defined as a service entity manageable
				in the VPMS architecture.  A single VPMS instance provides
				an isolated service reachability domain to each CE, so it
				corresponds to a so-called "VPN" as it allows communication among a specific set of
				sites.
				A single VPMS instance provides a unique
				point-to-multipoint L2VPN service.  
				In Figure 1, there are two VPMS instances shown,
				VPMS A and VPMS B.  In principle, there is no traffic exchange
				allowed between these different instances, so they are treated
				as different VPNs.
			</t>

			<t>
				In a VPMS, a single CE-PE link connection is used for transmitting frames
				for delivery to multiple remote CEs, with point-to-multipoint duplication.
				The SP's network (PE as well as P) has a role to replicate frames so that
				the sender's CE does not need to send multiple frames to individual receivers.
			</t>

			<t>
				Like VPWS, an Attachment Circuit (AC) is provided to accommodate CEs
				in a VPMS.  In a VPMS, an AC attached to a VPMS MUST be configured as
				"root" (sender) or "leaf" (receiver) not both.  
				Any AC is associated with
				the role of either sending side (Tx) or receiving side (Rx) from the
				view of the CE.  
				These will be named the root (sender) AC and leaf (receiver) AC respectively.
				Unless reverse traffic is optionally supported, a root AC does not
				transmit traffic
				back to a CE at upstream side, likewise a leaf AC does not
				receive traffic from a CE at downstream side.
				In Figure 1, AC1 and AC3 are configured as root ACs while AC2,
				AC4, AC5 and AC6 are configured as leaf ACs.  In VPMS A, CE1 could send traffic
				via AC1, and CE2 and CE5 could receive the traffic.
				
			</t>

			<t>
				A CE which is locally connected to a root AC
				is called a root (sender) CE.  Also a CE which is locally
				connected to a leaf AC is called a leaf (receiver) CE.
				However, such CEs’s roles will not be 
				managed directly in VPMS because the configured AC’s role
				(root or leaf)
				will automatically determine them.
			</t>

			<t>
				Similarly, a PE which locally accommodates a root AC is called a root (sender) PE.
				A PE which locally accommodates a leaf AC is called a leaf (receiver) PE.
			</t>

			<t>
				Basically there is a one-to-one mapping between an
				attachment circuit and a VPMS instance. 
				For example, all traffic from CE1 to
				PE1 (thorough AC1) is mapped to VPMS A (to CE2 and CE5).
			</t>

			<t> 
				In a VPMS, P2MP tree-shaped reachability is given from 
				a single root AC to several leaf ACs.  This will be named
				a "P2MP connection" in this VPMS framework.  P2MP connection is
				a logical entity between PE/ACs in a given VPMS instance
				that transfers unidirectional traffic 
				transparently from one local ingress AC to one or more remote
				egress ACs.  
			</t>

			<t>
				Similar to other L2VPN mechanisms, the VPMS architecture is based on 
				PWs which may be using
				through IP or MPLS-enabled PSN tunnels over a routed backbone.
				That is, every P2MP connection can be instantiated by 
				PW technology that supports P2MP traffic optimization
				(i.e., P2MP PW.  See section 7.2.).
				P2MP traffic optimization will
				provide the benefit of traffic replication for high bandwidth efficiency.
				That is, the sender CE has only to transmit one stream towards the PE and
				it does not have to replicate traffic.  
			</t>

			<t>
				Regarding end-to-end traffic topology between the ACs,
				a single VPMS instance (i.e., one VPN) may correspond
				to a single P2MP connection. 
				In Figure 1, VPMS A (one instance) has one P2MP connection
				(from AC1 to AC2 and AC5).  However, there
				is also a case that a single VPMS consists of two or more P2MP connections
				grouped, which is typically used for redundancy.  The
				details are given in section 6.4.
			</t>

			<t>
				VPMS can support various Layer 2 protocol services
				such as Ethernet, ATM, etc.

						If there is only one receiver in the instance, it is considered equivalent to
						unidirectional point-to-point traffic.
					</t>
				</section>


				<section title="Reverse Traffic Support">

					<t>
						There are cases where a reverse traffic flow is needed.  A sender CE
						may need to receive traffic from receiver CEs.
						There are some usage scenarios for this, such as stream monitoring through a
						loopback mechanism, control channels which need feedback communication
						etc.  
						A possible way to accomplish this is to provide different
						VPMS instances for reverse traffic, i.e. a sender CE is a receiver
						of another VPMS instance.  However, provisioning
						different VPNs for a particular customer would
						make its management task more complex.
						It is desired to have an alternative solution for supporting reverse traffic flow.
						This section provides additional requirements for this optional capability.
					</t>

					<t>
						A VPMS solution 
						MAY support reverse traffic from a leaf AC to a root AC.
						Each reverse path is basically given in a P2P (unicast) manner.
						In other words, each leaf of the P2MP
						tree can individually send back traffic to the root.
						For this purpose a VPMS instance MAY have more than one 
						reverse P2P connections as network entity;
						However, such network entities MUST have a common field that enables
						themselves to be managed
						together in the same VPN.  Any PWs used for such
						connections are expected to
						be assigned a common VPMS instance ID.
					</t>

					<t>
						Note, a VPMS does not assume any-to-any multipoint reachability.
						Therefore, in principle, every leaf AC
						does not exchange traffic directly with other leaf ACs
						even if reverse traffic is supported.
					</t>
						
						
					<t>
						Figure 3 illustrates this kind of scenario,
						where CE1 is configured as a sender 
						in VPMS A.  AC1 is a root AC, and AC2/AC3/AC4 are leaf ACs.
						P2MP connection is given for forward traffic.
						Unidirectional P2P connection is
						also provided for reverse traffic from AC4 to AC1.    
						Other reverse P2P connections
						can be provided similarly. (from AC2 to AC1 / from AC3 to AC1).
					</t>

					<t>
						In this case, PEs need to deal with two types of traffic,
						locally-attached CE's sending (Tx) and receiving (Rx) flows.  In Figure 3, they are
						both passing through the same AC (AC1 and AC4). 
						But it is an implementation matter
						if Tx and Rx traffic are conveyed on the same physical link or separate links.
						It is also possible
						that a root PE multiplexes two ore more reverse traffic from different leaves
						and transmits it to an upstream CE over the same local link.
					</t>

					<t>
						Note, in most implementations of VPWS today, every AC is always
						considered bidirectional.  In contrast, in VPMS, every AC can be chosen
						unidirectional (if it is a totally unidirectional service), or bidirectional
						(if reverse traffic is supported).

			<section title="Transparency">
				<t>
					A solution is intended to provide Layer-2 traffic transparency.
					Transparency SHOULD be supported per VPMS instance basis.
					In other words, Layer 2 traffic can be transparently transported
					from a sender CE to receiver CEs in a given instance.  Note, however,
					if service delimiting fields (VLAN Id in Ethernet, VPI/VCI in ATM,
					DLCI in FR etc.) are assigned by the SP, the Layer 2 traffic is not necessarily
					transparent.  It will
					depend on the SP’s choice if they are assigned at each AC.  Hence, it
					could be that some of receiver CEs are getting traffic with different
					delimiting fields than the other receiver CEs.
				</t>

				<t>
					The VPMS solution SHOULD NOT require any special packet processing by the
					end users (CEs).
				</t>
			</section>

			<section title="Quality of Service (QoS)">
				<t>
					A customer may require that the VPMS service provide guaranteed QoS.
					In particular, for real time applications which are considered common
					in point-to-multipoint delivery, delay and loss sensitive traffic
					MUST be supported.  The solution SHOULD provide native QoS techniques
					for service class differentiation, 
					such as IEEE 802.1p CoS for Ethernet.
				</t>
				<t>
					For bandwidth committed services (e.g., ATM CBR),
					a solution SHOULD guarantee end-to-end bandwidth.
					It MAY provide flow admission control mechanisms to achieve that.
				</t>
			</section>


			<section title="High Availability">


				<t>
					A solution MUST provide protection and restoration mechanism
					for end-to-end services to ensure high availability.
				</t>

				<t>
					There are multiple parts of the connection that can support protection and restoration:
					(1) CE to PE, (2) between PEs (3) inside core (PSN backbone).
					It is expected that (3) is 
					fulfilled by existing PSN protection mechanisms
					(e.g., RSVP-TE FRR).  Following subsections will cover the requirements
					for redundancy support for (1) and (2).
				</t>

				<section title="Dual-homed Access Support">
					<t>
						A solution MUST allow dual-homed redundant access from a CE to
						multiple PEs.  This if beneficial to support reliable data delivery for
						customers.  Figure 3 provides an example of this access topology.

					<t>
						A solution SHOULD provide
						a protection mechanism between the redundant PEs to which a CE is dual-homed.
						This is because
						when an ingress root PE node fails whole traffic delivery will fail unless
						a backup root PE is provided, even in case of dual-homed access.
						Similarly, if an egress leaf PE node fails, traffic toward that CE is never
						received unless a backup leaf PE is provided.  
					</t>

					<t>
						In some cases, the data source is required to be highly reliable since
						it is often deployed as a centralized server that provides
						traffic to many receivers.
						Therefore, there is an additional requirement specifically
						about redundancy of root-side: each VPMS instance SHOULD be able to have
						multiple P2MP connections whose roots are 
						located at separate root ACs.  Those root ACs can be
						located at physically separate root PEs, whereas
						those trees will share common leaf ACs.
						This means that each P2MP connection has a single root AC, but
						several P2MP connections can be managed together
						inside a common VPN.
					</t>

					<t>
						For example, in Figure 4, traffic from root AC1 and AC2
						both reach receivers CE3 and CE4 while AC1, AC2, AC3 and AC4
						all are associated with a single VPMS instance.  This topology is reliable
						since there are redundant root PE/ACs.
						At the egress side, PE3 and  PE4 select traffic from either root,
						PE1 or PE2.  Each leaf
						PE has one leaf AC only (AC3 attached to PE3, and AC4 attached to PE4).
						Therefore, PEs will need to support PW protection and restoration
						mechanism so that two redundant P2MP connections are given
						among common ACs.

						Note, if the solution supports dual-homed sender scenario 
						by multiple root ACs,
						it is expected that such a mechanism can also be used
						in multi-source scenrio.
						For example, suppose in TV
						provisioning scenario, a receiver CE has the fixed one interface
						to the leaf PE, and the CE needs to receive many TV
						channel traffic from two video servers (the two servers 
						provide different TV channels).  The two video servers are in

				<section title="Single/Dual Traffic Support in Dual-homed Access">
					<t>
						When dual-homed access to root PEs is provided, a solution MAY allow a sender CE to 
						transmit just a single copy of the traffic to either one of the two root (ingress) PEs
						 or to
						transmit a copy of the traffic to both the PEs simultaneously.  The latter
						scenario consumes more resource of CE-PE link than
						the single traffic scenario, but it is usually applicable when a source device has only a simple
						forwarding capability without any switchover functionality.
						In the dual traffic case, the backup root (ingress) PE SHOULD be able to
						filter the incoming unnecessary traffic while the other root PE is active.
						In either case,
						single traffic or dual traffic, the switchover mechanism between
						root (ingress) PEs will be necessary to handle
						traffic appropriately in failure.
					</t>
					<t>
						In the case of dual-homed access to leaf PEs, a solution MAY allow a receiver CE to
						receive a single copy of the traffic from either one of the two leaf (egress) PEs, or receive
						a copy of the traffic from both PEs simultaneously.
						The dual
						traffic approach is applicable if CE has fast switchover capability
						as a receiver by selecting either one of incoming traffic,
						but note that additional traffic resources are always
						consumed at PE-CE link of backup side.
						Specifically in the single traffic case, it might be needed to
						support switchover mechanism between egress PEs in failure.

			<section title="Pseudo Wire Signaling and PSN Tunneling">
				<t>
					A VPMS solution SHOULD provide an efficient replication that can
					contribute to optimizing the bandwidth usage required in a
					SP's network.  For supporting efficient replication, it is expected
					to take advantage of PW and PSN mechanisms that are capable of
					P2MP traffic.
				</t>
				<t>
					Regarding PW mechanism, 
					<xref target="I-D.ietf-pwe3-p2mp-pw-requirements"/>
					introduces P2MP PW concept and its requirements, showing two basic approaches of providing
					replication.  One is SS (Single Segment)-PW model that
					provides replication by PSN tunnel such as P2MP LSP (i.e., by outer
					label layer), and the other is MS (Multi Segment)-PW model
					that provides replication by multiple interconnected PWs
					(i.e., by inner label layer).  In either case, end-to-end P2MP
					topology (i.e., P2MP connection) in VPMS is common from the view of ACs.
					Requirements as a provider service specified in this document
					will be commonly applied regardless of P2MP PW's signaling model.
				</t>

				<t>
					It is out of scope
					of this document how to extend and use PW mechanisms
					to realize P2MP connections.
					For example, it is under the scope of the solution work how to support
					forward/reverse traffic e.g., by a single PW signaling,
					coupling multiple PWs, or other ways.
				</t>

				<t>
					This document does not raise any specific requirements for
					particular PSN tunneling schemes (point-to-point, point-to-multipoint and
					multipoint-to-multipoint) that is applied to VPMS.
					The actual type of PSN tunnel used in VPMS
					will be dependent on individual deployment scenarios
					(e.g., which PSN protocol is available in the core and how much
					of the network resources that operators will want to optimize).

					The information related to remote sites will be as follows:
				</t>
					<t>
						<list style='hanging'>
							<t hangText='-'>
								Information to identify the VPMS instance
							</t>
							<t hangText='-'>
								PE router ID / IP address as location information
							</t>
							<t hangText='-'>
								Information to identify Attachment Circuits
								and their associated group information to 
								compose a unique service (i.e., VPMS instance). 
							</t>
							<t hangText='-'>
								AC role in each VPMS (Sender or Receiver)
							</t>
							<t hangText='-'>
								SP-related information (AS number, etc. for an inter-provider case)
							</t>
						</list>
					</t>

				<t>
					Following is an example scenario:  by default,
					every PE will have the association among the information
					described above.  Suppose a new PE having an AC is provisioned
					in the existing VPMS instance and this AC is configured as receiver.
					This information will be automatically discovered by the
					other existing remote PEs (i.e., ingress and egress PEs
					in the same VPMS instance). Once the ingress PE discovers
					this new PE/AC, it can automatically add it as the new leaf
					of P2MP topology according to P2MP PW signaling mechanism.
					This operation does not require any new configuration at
					the existing PEs.
				</t>

				<t>
					Note that VPMS instance is created when one root PE and at least one leaf
					PE are added.  In principle VPMS requires such minimum provisioning.  
					Hence in dual-homing case of sender, only backup root PE can be dynamically
					added/deleted to/from VPMS without destroying the VPN. 
				</t>
				<t>
					( Editor's note: This might be under study, including auto-discovery
					requirement if any when multiple roots (sender-side PEs) exist.)

			<section title="Activation and Deactivation">

				<t>
					This section raises generic requirements for handling related
					information about remote sites after the initial provisioning to ease the
					total operation of VPMS.
				</t>

				<t>
					A solution SHOULD provide a way to 
					activate/deactivate the administrative status of each AC.
					After initial provisioning, 
					a SP might change connectivity configuration 
					between particular CEs inside a single VPMS instance
					for operational reasons.  This feature will be beneficial to
					help such a scenario.
				</t>
				<t>
					For example, in Figure 5,
					AC1, AC3, AC4 and AC5 are initially provisioned 
					for VPMS A.  AC2 is not provisioned for any VPMSes.  In VPMS A, CE1 is
					a sender and CE3, CE4 and CE5 are receivers.
					Traffic will usually flow from CE1 to all
					receivers, CE3, CE4 and CE5.  However, for maintenance operation,
					application's request (e.g., stream program has changed) or some other reasons,
					AC4 needs to
					be set as administratively deactivated.  Then it becomes necessary to
					turn off traffic from PE4 to CE4.  This operation
					must be appropriately distinguished from failure cases.
				</t>

				<t>
					When deactivating a particular site, backbone PSN/PW resources (e.g.,
					admission control of PSN tunnel) MAY be released for that particular
					direction in order to provide that bandwidth to other services.  In
					Figure 5, AC3 is now administratively activated and receiving traffic.
					However, if AC3 comes to be administratively deactivated, and if
					RSVP-TE (including P2P and/or P2MP) is used for backbone PSN, then TE
					reserved resources from PE1 to PE3 may be released.
				</t>

				<t>
					In addition, a solution SHOULD allow single-sided activation
					operation at a root (ingress) PE.  In some scenarios, operators prefer
					centralized operation.  This is often considered natural for one-way
					digital audio/video distribution applications: SPs often want to
					complete their service delivery by a single operation at one source
					PE, not by multiple operations at many leaf (egress) PEs.  Figure 5
					illustrates this scenario, where a SP only has to do single-sided
					operation at PE1 (source) to administratively activate/deactivate
					various connections from AC1 to AC3, AC4 and/or AC5.  It is not
					needed to perform operations on PE3 and PE4 directly.

			<section title="Inter-AS Support">
				<t>
					A solution SHOULD support inter-AS scenarios, where there is more
					than one provider providing a common VPMS instance and VPN.  More
					specifically, it is necessary to consider the case where some of the
					PEs that compose one VPMS belong to several different ASes.
				</t>
			</section>


			<section title="Co-existence with Existing L2VPNs">
				<t>
					A solution MUST co-exist with the existing L2VPNs
					(e.g., VPWS, VPLS)
					across the same SP's network.  A solution MUST NOT impede
					the operation
					of auto-discovery and signaling mechanism that
					are already supported by the PEs for those existing L2VPNs.
				</t>
			</section>


			<section title="Operation, Administration and Maintenance">
				<section title="Fault Management">
					<section title="Fault Detection">
						<t>
							A solution MUST provide tools that detect reachability failure and traffic looping of data transport in a VPMS instance.  If multiple root ACs are supported (i.e., multiple P2MP connections are grouped together into a single VPMS instance), such tools MUST be able to perform distinguishing each P2MP connection. 
						</t>
					</section>
					<section title="Fault Notification">
						<t>
							A solution MUST provide fault notification and trouble tracking mechanisms. (e.g.  SNMP-trap and syslog that notify fault to remote NMS.)
						</t>
						<t>
							In VPMS one point of failure at upstream often affects a number of downstream PEs and ACs that might raise a notification message.  Hence notification messages MAY be summarized or compressed for operators' ease of management.
						</t>
						<t>
							In case of receiver-side failure (leaf PE or its AC), this fault status SHOULD be able to be monitored at root PE.  This will help an operator to monitor each leaf PE/AC in a centralized manner; that is, a root PE can collect leaf-side information.  How this status is transferred depends on a solution.
						</t>
						<t>
							In contrast, in case of sender-side failure (root PE or its AC), this fault status SHOULD also be able to be monitored at leaf PEs. This will help an operator to troubleshoot at leaf PEs (i.e., distinguish local AC’s failure from remote root AC’s failure easily). 
						</t>
						<t>
							In any case of failure at SP’s network, fault information MAY be notified to the customer.  Specifically, such fault MAY trigger generating customer OAM message toward CEs (e.g., AIS) and/or shutting down leaf ACs.
						</t>
					</section>
					<section title="Fault Isolation">
						<t>
							A solution MUST provide diagnostic/troubleshooting tools
							for data transport in a VPMS instance.  
						</t>
					</section>

				</section>

				<section title="Testing">
					<t>
						A solution MUST provide a mechanism for testing each data connectivity and verifying the associated information in a VPMS instance.  The connectivity is between a root and all leaf ACs (i.e., each P2MP connection can be tested).
					</t>
					<t>
						Operators will run testing before and after service activation.  Testing mechanism SHOULD support end-to-end testing of the data path used by customer's data.  End-to-end testing will have CE-to-CE path test and PE-to-PE path test.  A solution MUST support PE-to-PE path test and MAY support CE-to-CE path test.  In either case the minimum data path unit for each VPMS is unidirectional, hence if loopback testing is supported, additional consideration about reverse-path might also be needed (see section 6.1.3). 
					</t>

 					<t>
						If there are multiple P2MP connections for redundancy (active/backup tree) in  a common VPMS (like in Figure 4),
						testing mechanism MUST be able to check the connectivity over not only working P2MP connection but also protecting connection(s).  This testing MUST be able to be performed from 
						a root PE.  It MAY also be able to be performed from a sender CE.
					</t>

				</section>

				<section title="Performance Management">
					<t>
						A solution MUST offer mechanisms to monitor traffic performance parameters and statistics of data traffic in VPMS.   
					</t>
					<t>
						A solution MUST provide access to:
					</t>
					<t>
						<list style='hanging'>
							<t hangText='-'>
								Traffic statistics (total traffic forwarded, incoming, outgoing, dropped, etc., by period of time)
							</t>
						</list>
					</t>
					<t>
						A solution SHOULD provide access to:
					</t>
					<t>
						<list style='hanging'>
							<t hangText='-'>
								Performance information related to traffic usage, e.g., one-way delay, one-way jitter, one-way loss, delay variations (the difference of various one-way delay from a particular root PE to multiple leaf PEs) etc.
							</t>
						</list>
					</t>
					<t>
						All or part of this information SHOULD be made available through standardized SNMP MIB Modules (Management Information Base).
					</t>
					<t>
						It is expected that such information can be used for SLA monitoring between sender and receiver, to give the SP a clear picture of current service providing to the customer.
