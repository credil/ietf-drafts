      <t>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) defines a domain-level
        authentication framework for email to permit verification of the
        source and contents of messages. This document specifies an adjunct
        mechanism to aid in assessing messages that do not contain a DKIM
        signature for the domain used in the author's address. It defines a
        record that can advertise whether they sign their outgoing mail, and
        how other hosts can access those records. </t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) defines a mechanism by which email
        messages can be cryptographically signed, permitting a signing domain
        to claim responsibility for the introduction of a message into the
        mail stream. Message recipients can verify the signature by querying
        the signer's domain directly to retrieve the appropriate public key,
        and thereby confirm that the message was attested to by a party in
        possession of the private key for the signing domain.</t>

      <t>However, the legacy of the Internet is such that not all messages
        will be signed, and the absence of a signature on a message is not an
        a priori indication of forgery. In fact, during early phases of
        deployment it is very likely that most messages will remain unsigned.
        However, some domains might decide to sign all of their outgoing mail,
        for example, to protect their brand name. It is desirable for such
        domains to be able to advertise that fact to other hosts. This is the
        topic of Author Domain Signing Practices (ADSP).</t>

      <t>Hosts implementing this specification can inquire what Author Signing
        Practices a domain advertises. This inquiry is called an Author
        Signing Practices check.</t>

      <t>The basic requirements for ADSP are given in <xref target="RFC5016"
         />. This document refers extensively to <xref target="RFC4871" /> and
        assumes the reader is familiar with it.</t>

      <section title="Terms Imported from DKIM Signatures Specification">

        <t>Some terminology used herein is derived directly from <xref
            target="RFC4871" />. In several cases, references in that document
          to Sender have been changed to Author here, to emphasize the
          relationship to the Author address(es) in the From: header field
          described in <xref target="RFC2822" />. Briefly, <list
            style="symbols">

            <t>A "Signer" is the agent that signs a message, as defined in
              section 2.1 of <xref target="RFC4871" />.</t>

            <!--   
  Selectors have nothing to do with ADSP.
  
  <t>A "Selector" specifies which of the keys published by a signing
              domain is to be queried, as defined in section 3.1 of <xref
                target="RFC4871" />.</t>
-->
            <t>A "Local-part" is the part of an address preceding the @ sign,
              as defined in <xref target="RFC2822" /> and used in <xref
                target="RFC4871" />.</t>
          </list></t>

      </section>
      <section title="Valid Signature">

        <t>A "Valid Signature" is any signature on a message which correctly
          verifies using the procedure described in section 6.1 of <xref
            target="RFC4871" />.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Author Address">

        <t>An "Author Address" is an email address in the From header field of
          a message <xref target="RFC2822" />. If the From header field
          contains multiple addresses, the message has multiple Author
          Addresses.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Author Domain">

        <t>An "Author Domain" is everything to the right of the "@" in an
          Author Address (excluding the "@" itself).</t>

      </section>
      <!-- <section title="Alleged Signer">

	 <t>An "Alleged Signer" is the identity of the signer claimed in a DKIM-Signature
	   header field in a message received; it is
	   "alleged" because it has not yet been verified.</t>

       </section> -->
      <section title="Alleged Author">

        <t>An "Alleged Author" is an Author Address of a message; it is
          "alleged" because it has not yet been verified.</t>

      </section>
      <section title="Author Domain Signing Practices">

        <t>"Author Domain Signing Practices" (or just "practices") consist of
          a machine-readable record published by the domain of an Alleged
          Author which includes statements about the domain's practices with
          respect to mail it sends with its domain in the From: line.</t>

      </section>
      <section title="Author Signature">

        <t>An "Author Signature" is any Valid Signature where the identity of
          the user or agent on behalf of which the message is signed (listed
          in the "<spanx style="verb">i=</spanx>" tag or its default value
          from the "<spanx style="verb">d=</spanx>" tag) matches an Author
          Address in the message. When the identity of the user or agent
          includes a Local-part, the identities match if the Local-parts match
          and the domains match. Otherwise, the identities match if the
          domains match. </t>


        <t>For example, if a message has a Valid Signature, with the
          DKIM-Signature field containing <spanx style="verb"
            >i=a@domain.example</spanx>, then domain.example is asserting that
          it takes responsibility for the message. If the message's From:
          field contains the address <spanx style="verb"
          >b@domain.example</spanx> and an ADSP query produces a <spanx
            style="verb">dkim=all</spanx> or <spanx style="verb"
            >dkim=discardable</spanx> result, that would mean that the message
          does not have a valid Author Signature. Even though the message is
          signed by the same domain, its failure to satisfy ADSP could be
          problematic.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Operation Overview">

      <t>Domain owners can publish ADSP information via a query mechanism such
        as the Domain Name System; specific details are given in <xref
          target="dnsrep" />.</t>

      <t>Hosts can look up the ADSP information of the domain(s) specified by
        the Author Address(es) as described in <xref target="Lookup" />. If a
        message has multiple Author Addresses the ADSP lookups SHOULD be
        performed independently on each address. This standard does not
        address the process a host might use to combine the lookup results. </t>
      <section anchor="applicability" title="ADSP Applicability">
        <t> ADSP as defined in this document is bound to DNS. For this reason,
          ADSP is applicable only to Author Domains with appropriate DNS
          records (see Note below). The handling of other Author Domains is
          outside the scope of this document. However, attackers may use such
          domain names in a deliberate attempt to sidestep an organization's
          ADSP policy statements. It is up to the ADSP verifier implementation
          to return an appropriate error result for Author Domains outside the
          scope of ADSP. <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Note:  "> The results from DNS queries that are
              intended to validate a domain name unavoidably approximate
              the set of Author Domains that can appear in legitimate email.
              For example, a DNS A record could belong to a device that does
              not even have an email implementation. It is up to the verifier
              to decide what degree of approximation is acceptable.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>
      <section title="ADSP Usage">

        <t>Depending on the Author Domain(s) and the signatures in a message,
          a recipient gets varying amounts of useful information from each
          ADSP lookup. <list style="symbols">

            <t>If a message has no Valid Signature, the ADSP result is
              directly relevant to the message.</t>

            <t>If a message has a Valid Signature from an Author Domain, ADSP
              provides no benefit relative to that domain since the message is
              already known to be compliant with any possible ADSP for that
              domain.</t>

            <t>If a message has a Valid Signature from a domain other than an
              Author Domain, the receiver can use both the Signature and the
              ADSP result in its evaluation of the message.</t>

          </list></t>
      </section>



      <section title="ADSP Results">

        <t>An ADSP lookup for an Author Address produces one of four possible
          results: <list style="symbols">

            <t>Messages from this domain might or might not have an author
              signature. This is the default if the domain exists in the DNS
              but no record is found.</t>

            <t>All messages from this domain are signed.</t>

            <t>All messages from this domain are signed and discardable. </t>

    <section title="Detailed Description">

      <section anchor="dnsrep" title="DNS Representation">

        <t>ADSP records are published using the DNS TXT resource record type.</t>

        <!--        <t>NON-NORMATIVE DISCUSSION [to be removed before publication]: There
          has been considerable discussion on the DKIM WG mailing list
          regarding the relative advantages of TXT and a new resource record
          (RR) type. Read the archive for details.</t>-->

        <t>The RDATA for ADSP resource records is textual in format, with
          specific syntax and semantics relating to their role in describing
          ADSP. The "Tag=Value List" syntax described in section 3.2 of <xref
            target="RFC4871" /> is used. Records not in compliance with that
          syntax or the syntax of individual tags described in Section 4.3
          MUST be ignored (considered equivalent to a NODATA result) for
          purposes of ADSP, although they MAY cause the logging of warning
          messages via an appropriate system logging mechanism. If the RDATA
          contains multiple character strings, the strings are logically
          concatenated with no delimiters between the strings. </t>

        <t>The ADSP record for a domain is published at a location in the
          domain's DNS hierarchy prefixed by _adsp._domainkey.; e.g., the ADSP
          record for example.com would be a TXT record that is published at
            <spanx style="verb">_adsp._domainkey.example.com</spanx>. A domain
          MUST NOT publish more than one ADSP record; the semantics of an ADSP
          lookup that returns multiple ADSP records for a single domain are
          undefined. (Note that example.com and mail.example.com are different
          domains.) </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Publication of ADSP Records">

        <t>ADSP is intended to apply to all mail sent using the domain name

          do so for both itself and all of its "descendants" (child domains at
          all lower levels). Domains wishing to do so MUST publish ADSP records
          for the domain itself and any subdomains.</t>-->

        <t>Wildcards within a domain publishing ADSP records pose a particular

              degree of over-approximation is acceptable. The verifier MUST
              return an appropriate error result for Author Domains that are
              outside the scope of ADSP.</t>
            <t>One possible approach is to perform a single DNS MX query for
              an Author Domain, and to declare the domain out of scope for
              ADSP if the result is NXDOMAIN (i.e. no DNS record of any type
              exists for the domain). Another approach is to follow section 5
              of [SMTP], and to declare the domain out of scope for ADSP if
              the required DNS records do not exist. <list style="hanging">
                <t hangText="NOTE:  ">Because an ADSP-publishing domain owner
                  cannot tell which of the discussed methods will be used by a
                  verifier, the domain owner needs to be careful in publishing
                  ADSP records to ensure that their practices are communicated
                  correctly to all receivers, regardless of how receivers
                  decide to check for ADSP applicability. When a registered
                  domain name lacks a corresponding ADSP record, attackers can
                  use it as the Author Domain in unauthorized email, and
                  sidestep the domain owner's ADSP policies. To ensure that
                  ADSP will apply to all registered hostnames in a domain
                  sub-tree, the domain owner needs to publish ADSP records

    <section title="Security Considerations">

      <t>Security considerations in the ADSP are mostly related to attempts on
        the part of malicious senders to represent themselves as authors for
        whom they are not authorized to send mail, often in an attempt to
        defraud either the recipient or an Alleged Author.</t>

      <t>Additional security considerations regarding Author Domain Signing
        Practices are found in <xref target="RFC4686">the DKIM threat
        analysis</xref>.</t>
      <section title="ADSP Threat Model">

        <t>Email recipients often have a core set of content authors that they
          already trust. Common examples include financial institutions with
          which they have an existing relationship and Internet web
          transaction sites with which they conduct business.</t>

        <t>Email abuse often seeks to exploit the name-recognition that
          recipients will have, for a legitimate email author, by using its
          domain name in the From: header field. Especially since many popular
          MUAs do not display the author's email address, there is no
          empirical evidence of the extent that this particular unauthorized
          use of a domain name contributes to recipient deception or that
          eliminating it will have significant effect.</t>

        <t>However, closing this exploit could facilitate some types of
          optimized processing by receive-side message filtering engines,
          since it could permit them to maintain higher-confidence assertions
          about From: header field uses of a domain, when the occurrence is
          authorized.</t>

        <t>Unauthorized uses of domain names occur elsewhere in messages, as
          do unauthorized uses of organizations' names. These attacks are
          outside the scope of this specification.</t>

        <t>ADSP does not provide any benefit--nor, indeed, have any effect at
          all--unless an external system acts upon the verdict, either by
          treating the message differently during the delivery process or by
          showing some indicator to the end recipient. Such a system is out of
          scope for this specification.</t>

        <t>ADSP Checkers may perform multiple DNS lookups per Alleged Author
          Domain. Since these lookups are driven by domain names in email
          message headers of possibly fraudulent email, legitimate ADSP
          Checkers can become participants in traffic multiplication
        attacks.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="DNS Attacks">

        <t>An attacker might attack the DNS infrastructure in an attempt to
          impersonate ADSP records, in an attempt to influence a receiver's
          decision on how it will handle mail. However, such an attacker is
          more likely to attack at a higher level, e.g., redirecting A or MX
          record lookups in order to capture traffic that was legitimately
          intended for the target domain. These DNS security issues are
          addressed by <xref target="RFC4033">DNSSEC</xref>.</t>

        <t>Because ADSP operates within the framework of the legacy e-mail
          system, the default result in the absence of an ADSP record is that
          the domain does not sign all of its messages. It is therefore
          important that the ADSP clients distinguish a DNS failure such as
            <spanx style="verb">SERVFAIL</spanx> from other DNS errors so that
          appropriate actions can be taken.</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="wildcards" title="DNS Wildcards">

        <t>If a domain has valid wildcard MX, A, or AAAA records, then any
          subdomain that does not otherwise exist according to [RFC4592] is a
          valid mail domain. It is possible to add a wildcard TXT record
          alongside a wildcard MX that will provide suitable ADSP records for
          any domain chosen by an attacker, since if the wildcard synthesizes
          chosen-name.example.com IN MX, it will then also synthesize
          _adsp._domainkey.chosen-name.example.com IN TXT. However multiple
          wildcard TXT records produce an undefined ADSP result, which means
          you cannot also publish both ADSP records and records for any other
          TXT-using protocol (such as SPF) for a wildcard domain.</t>

    <references title="References - Informative"> &rfc5016; </references>
    <section title="Usage Examples">
      <t>These examples are intended to illustrate typical uses of ADSP. They
        are not intended to be exhaustive, nor to apply to every domain's or
        mail system's individual situation.</t>

      <t>Domain managers are advised to consider the ways that mail processing
        can modify messages in ways that will invalidate an existing DKIM
        signature, such as mailing lists, courtesy forwarders, and other paths
        that could add or modify headers, or modify the message body. In that
        case, if the modifications invalidate the DKIM signature, recipient
        hosts will consider the mail not to have an Author Signature, even
        though the signature was present when the mail was originally sent.</t>

      <section title="Single Location Domains">
        <t>A common mail system configuration handles all of a domain's users'
          incoming and outgoing mail through a single MTA or group of MTAs. In
          that case, the MTA(s) can be configured to sign outgoing mail with
          an Author Signature.</t>
        <t>In this situation it might be appropriate to publish an ADSP record
          for the domain containing "all", depending on whether the users also
          send mail through other paths that do not apply an Author Signature.
          Such paths could include MTAs at hotels or hotspot networks used by
          travelling users, or web sites that provide "mail an article"
          features.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Bulk Mailing Domains">
        <t>Another common configuration uses a domain solely for bulk or
          broadcast mail, with no individual human users, again typically
          sending all the mail through a single MTA or group of MTAs that can
          apply an Author Signature. In this case, the domain's management can
          be confident that all of its outgoing mail will be sent through the
          signing MTA. Lacking individual users, the domain is unlikely to
          participate in mailing lists, but could still send mail through
          other paths that might invalidate signatures.</t>

        <t>Domain owners often use specialist mailing providers to send their
          bulk mail. In that case, the mailing provider needs access to a
          suitable signing key in order to apply an Author Signature. One
          possible route would be for the domain owner to generate the key and
          give it to the mailing provider. Another would be for the domain to
          delegate a subdomain to the mailing provider, for example,
          bigbank.example might delegate email.bigbank.example to such a
          provider. In that case, the provider can generate the keys and DKIM
          DNS records itself and use the subdomain in the Author address in
          the mail.</t>

	<t>Regardless of the DNS and key management strategy chosen, whoever
	  maintains the DKIM records for the domain could also install an
	  ADSP record containing "all".</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Bulk Mailing Domains with Discardable Mail">
        <t>In some cases, a domain might sign all its outgoing mail with an
          Author Signature, but prefer that recipient systems discard mail
          without a valid Author Signature to avoid confusion from mail sent
          from sources that do not apply an Author Signature. (This latter
          kind of mail is sometimes loosely called "forgeries".) In that case,
          it might be appropriate to publish an ADSP record containing
          "discardable". Note that a domain SHOULD NOT publish a "discardable"
          record if it wishes to maximize the likelihood that mail from the
          domain is delivered, since it could cause some fraction of the mail
          the domain sends to be discarded.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Third Party Senders">

        <t>Another common use case is for a third party to enter into an
          agreement whereby that third party will send bulk or other mail on
          behalf of a designated author or author domain, using that domain in
          the RFC2822 From: or other headers. Due to the many and varied
          complexities of such agreements, third party signing is not
          addressed in this specification.
          <!-- The
	   authors anticipate that as mail systems gain experience
	   with DKIM, it will become possible to codify best practices
	   of this and other usages of DKIM. --></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Non-email Domains">
        <t>If a domain sends no mail at all, it can safely
          publish a "discardable" ADSP record, since any mail with an author
          address in the domain is a forgery.</t>
