Abstract 

   An extension to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) defines the 
   general notion of a "Typed Wildcard Forwarding Equivalence Class 
   (FEC) Element".  This can be used when it is desired to request all 
   label bindings for a given type of FEC Element, or to release or 
   withdraw all label bindings for a given type of FEC element.  
   However, a typed wildcard FEC element must be individually defined 
   for each type of FEC element.  This specification defines the typed 
   wildcard FEC elements for the Pseudowire Identifier (PW Id) and 
   Generalized Pseudowire Identifier (Gen. PW Id) FEC types.

Internet-Draft       LDP Typed Wildcard PW FEC Elements    January 2011 
    

1. Introduction 

   An extension [RFC5918] to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) 
   [RFC5036] defines the general notion of a "Typed Wildcard Forwarding 
   Equivalence Class (FEC) Element".  This can be used when it is 
   desired to request all label bindings for a given type of FEC 
   Element, or to release or withdraw all label bindings for a given 
   type of FEC element.  However, a typed wildcard FEC element must be 
   individually defined for each type of FEC element. 

   [RFC4447] defines the "PWid FEC Element" and "Generalized PWid FEC 
   Element" but it does not specify Typed Wildcard format for these 
   elements. This document specifies the format of the Typed Wildcard 
   FEC for the "PWid FEC Element" and the "Generalized PWid FEC 
   Element" defined in [RFC4447]. The procedures for Typed Wildcard 
   processing for PWid and Generalized PWid FEC Elements are same as 
   described in [RFC5918] for any typed wildcard FEC Element type. 

   
2. Typed Wildcard for PWid FEC Element 

   The format of the PWid FEC Typed Wildcard FEC is: 

    0                   1                   2 
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3  
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   | Typed Wcard   | Type = PWid   |   Len = 0     | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

     FEC Element Type (one octet): PWid FEC Element (type 0x80 
     [RFC4447]) 

     Len FEC Type Info (one octet):  Zero. (There is no additional FEC 
     info) 

3. Typed Wildcard for Generalized PWid FEC Element 

   The format of the Generalized PWid FEC Typed Wildcard FEC is:

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3   
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   | Typed Wcard   | Type=Gen.PWid |   Len = 0     | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   Figure 2: Format of Generalized PWid Typed Wildcard FEC Element 
    
   Where:   

     Typed Wcard (one octet): as specified in [RFC5918]     

     FEC Element Type (one octet): Generalized PWid FEC Element (type 
     0x81 [RFC4447]) 

     Len FEC Type Info (one octet):  Zero. (There is no additional FEC 
     info) 

  When Generalized PWid FEC Typed Wildcard is used, "PW Grouping ID 
  TLV" [RFC4447] MUST NOT be present in the same message.  
 
4. Operation 

   The use of Typed Wildcard FEC elements for PW can be useful under 
   several scenarios. This section describes two use cases to 
   illustrate their usage. The following use cases consider two LSR 
   nodes, A and B, with LDP session between them to exchange L2VPN PW 
   bindings. 

4.1. PW Consistency Check 

   A user may request a control plane consistency check at LSR A for 
   the PWid FEC and Generalized PWid FEC bindings that it had learnt 
   from LSR B over LDP session.  To perform this consistency check, LSR 
   A marks all its learnt PW bindings from LSR B as stale, and then 
   send a Label Request message towards LSR B with Typed Wildcard FEC 
   element for PWid FEC element and Generalized PWid FEC element. Upon 
   receipt of such request, LSR B replays its database related to PWid 
   FEC elements and Generalized PWid FEC element in Label Mapping 
   message. As a PW binding is received at LSR A, the associated 
   binding state is marked as refreshed (no stale).  When replay 
   completes for a given type of FEC, LSR B sends End-of-LIB 
   Notification [RFC5919] to mark the end of update for the given 
   FEC type. Upon receipt of this Notification at LSR A, any remaining 
   stale PW binding of given FEC type learnt from the peer LSR B, is

Internet-Draft       LDP Typed Wildcard PW FEC Elements    January 2011 
    

   cleaned up and removed from the database. This completes consistency 
   check with LSR B at LSR A for given FEC type. 

4.2. PW Graceful Shutdown 

   It may be desirable to perform shutdown/removal of existing PW 
   bindings advertised towards a peer in a graceful manner -- i.e. all 
   advertised PW bindings to be removed from a peer without session 
   flap.  For example, to request a graceful delete of the PWid FEC and 
   Generalized PWid FEC bindings at LSR A learnt from LSR B, LSR A 
   would send a Label Withdraw message towards LSR B with Typed 
   Wildcard FEC elements pertaining to PWid FEC element and Generalized 
   PWid FEC element. Upon receipt of such message, LSR B will delete 
   all PWid and Generalized PWid bindings learnt from LSR A. 
   Afterwards, LSR B would send Label Release message corresponding to 
   recieved Label Withdraw with Typed FEC element.  

5. Security Considerations 

  No new security considerations beyond that apply to the base LDP 
  specification [RFC5036], [RFC4447] and [MPLS_SEC] apply to the use of 
  the PW Typed Wildcard FEC Element types described in this document. 
   
6. IANA Considerations 

This document defines no new element for IANA Consideration.
