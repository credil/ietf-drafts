              Individual Session Control Feature for TWAMP
                 draft-ietf-ippm-twamp-session-cntrl-04

Abstract

   The IETF has completed its work on the core specification of TWAMP -
   the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol.  This memo describes an
   OPTIONAL feature for TWAMP, that gives the controlling host the
   ability to start and stop one or more individual test sessions using
   Session Identifiers.  The base capability of the TWAMP protocol
   requires all test sessions previously requested and accepted to start
   and stop at the same time.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft            TWAMP Session Control            February 2010


1.  Introduction

   The IETF has completed its work on the core specification of TWAMP -
   the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol [RFC5357].  TWAMP is an
   extension of the One-way Active Measurement Protocol, OWAMP
   [RFC4656].  The TWAMP specification gathered wide review as it
   approached completion, and the by-products were several
   recommendations for new features in TWAMP.  There are a growing
   number of TWAMP implementations at present, and wide-spread usage is
   expected.  There are even devices that are designed to test
   implementations for protocol compliance.

   This memo describes an OPTIONAL feature for TWAMP.  TWAMP (and OWAMP)
   start all previously requested and accepted test sessions at once.
   This feature allows the Control-Client to control individual test
   sessions on the basis of their Session Identifier (SID).  This
   feature permits a short duration TWAMP test to start (and/or stop)
   during a longer test.  This feature permits a specific diagnostic
   test to begin if intermediate results indicate that the test is
   warranted, for example.

   This feature requires a Mode bit position assignment and the
   assignment of two new TWAMP command numbers (for the augmented Start
   and Stop commands).  This feature also specifies a new Stop-ACK
   Server response, to complete the symmetry of the session stopping
   process in the same way as the Start-ACK response.

   Implementers of this feature MAY also wish to implement the "Reflect
   Octets" feature, described in [I-D.ietf-ippm-twamp-reflect-octets],
   once it has been published as an RFC.  This feature allows a Control-
   Client to insert a locally-specified request number into the Request-
   TW-Session command (in octets originally designated MBZ=Must Be
   Zero), and a compliant Server will return the request number in its
   reply (Accept message).

   This memo is intended to be an update to the TWAMP core protocol
   specified in [RFC5357].  It is not required to implement the feature
   described in this memo to claim compliance with [RFC5357].

   Throughout this memo, the bits marked MBZ (Must Be Zero) MUST be set
   to zero by senders and MUST be ignored by receivers.


2.  Purpose and Scope

   The purpose of this memo is to describe an additional OPTIONAL
   function and feature for TWAMP [RFC5357].  The feature needs a clear
   description so it can be discussed and (hopefully) adopted in the IP

   Performance Metrics Charter.

   The scope of the memo is currently limited to specifications of the
   following features:

   1.  Extension of the modes of operation through assignment of a new
       value in the Mode field to communicate feature capability and
       use,

   2.  the definitions of augmented start session and stop session
       commands (with corresponding acknowledgements), and

   3.  the definition of related procedures for TWAMP entities.

   The motivation for this feature is the ability to start and stop
   individual test sessions at will, using a single TWAMP-control
   connection.

   When the Server and Control-Client have agreed to use the Individual
   Session Control mode during control connection setup, then the
   Control-Client, the Server, the Session-Sender, and the Session-
   Reflector MUST all conform to the requirements of that mode, as
   identified below.  The original TWAMP-Control Start and Stop commands
   MUST NOT be used.


3.  TWAMP Control Extensions

   TWAMP-Control protocol is a derivative of the OWAMP-Control protocol,
   and provides two-way measurement capability.  TWAMP [RFC5357] uses
   the Modes Field to identify and select specific communication
   capabilities, and this field is a recognized extension mechanism.
   The following sections describe one such extension.

3.1.  Connection Setup with Individual Session Control

   TWAMP-Control connection establishment follows the procedure defined
   in section 3.1 of [RFC4656] OWAMP.  The Individual Session Control
   mode requires one new bit position (and value) to identify the
   ability of the Server/Session-Reflector to start and stop specific
   sessions (according to their Session Identifier, or SID).  This new
   feature requires an additional TWAMP mode bit assignment as follows:

   --------------------------------------------------------
   zzz    Individual Session      this memo, bit position (Z)
          Control


   In the original OWAMP mode field, setting bit positions 0, 1 or 2
   indicated the security mode of the Control protocol, and the Test
   protocol inherited the same mode (see section 4 of [RFC4656]).  In
   the [RFC5618] memo, bit position (3) allows a different security mode
   in the Test protocol and uses the unauthenticated test packet format.

   If the Server sets the new bit position (bit position Z) in the
   Server Greeting message to indicate its capabilities, then the Server
   and Session-Reflector MUST comply with the requirements of this memo
   to control sessions on an individual basis if desired.

   If the Control-Client intends to control sessions on an individual
   basis (according to the requirements in this memo), it MUST set the
   mode bit (Z, corresponding to the new mode) in the Setup Response
   message.  This means that:

   1.  The Control-Client and the Server MUST use the start and stop
       commands intended for individual session control and the
       corresponding acknowledgements, as defined in the sections that
       follow.

   2.  The Control-Client and the Server MUST NOT use the start and stop
       commands (2 and 3) and the acknowledgement defined in [RFC5357].

   The Control-Client MUST also set one mode bit to indicate the chosen
   security mode (currently bits 0, 1, 2, or 3), consistent with the
   modes offered by the Server.  The Control-Client MAY also set Modes
   bit Z with other features and bit positions (such as the reflect
   octets feature).

   If the Control-Client has selected the Reflect Octets feature
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-twamp-reflect-octets] in combination with the
   Individual Session Control feature (after the Server identified its
   capability), AND utilizes the feature to insert a locally-specified
   request number in the Request-TW-Session command, THEN the Control
   Client MAY send more than one Request-TW-Session command to a given

   Server without waiting for the corresponding Accept-Session message.
   In such a case the Access-Session response reflects the locally-
   specified request number.  Note that when the Reflect Octets feature
   is being used all Request-TW-Session command and Accept-Session
   responses MUST include the locally-specified request number.

3.2.  Start-N-Sessions Command with Individual Session Control

   Having

   o  initiated Individual Session Control mode in the Setup Response,

   o  requested one or more test sessions, and

   o  received affirmative Accept-Session response(s),

   a TWAMP Client MAY start the execution of one or more test sessions
   by sending a Start-N-Sessions message to the Server (note that "N"
   indicates that this command is applicable to one or more sessions,
   and does not change with the number of sessions identified in the
   command).

   The format of the Start-N-Sessions message is as follows:

   The Command Number value of 7 indicates that this is a Start-N-
   Sessions command.  The Control-Client MUST compose this command, and
   the Server MUST interpret this command, according to the field
   descriptions below.

   The Number of Sessions field indicates the count of sessions that
   this Start command applies to, and must be one or greater.  The
   number of SID fields that follow MUST be equal to the value in the
   Number of Sessions field (otherwise, the command MUST NOT be affirmed
   with a zero Accept field in the Start-N-Ack response).

   All SID fields are constructed as defined in the last paragraph of
   OWAMP section 3.5 [RFC4656] (and referenced in TWAMP).  Note that the
   SID is assigned by the Server during the session request exchange.

   The message is terminated with a single block HMAC, as illustrated
   above.

   The Server MUST respond with one or more Start-N-Ack messages (which
   SHOULD be sent as quickly as possible).  Start-N-Ack messages SHALL
   have the format defined in the next session.

   When using Individual Session Control mode and its Start-N-Ack
   command as described in the next section, multiple Start-N-Sessions
   commands MAY be sent without waiting for acknowledgement, and the
   Start-N-sessions commands MAY arrive in any order.

3.3.  Start-N-Ack Command with Individual Session Control

   The Server responds to the Start-N-Sessions command (for one or more
   specific sessions referenced by their SIDs) with one or more Start-N-
   Ack commands with Accept fields corresponding to one or more of the
   SIDs.  This allows for the possibility that a Server cannot
   immediately start one or more the sessions referenced in a particular
   Start-N-Sessions command, but can start one or more of the sessions.

   The format of the message is as follows.

   The Command Number value of 8 indicates that this is a Start-N-Ack
   message.  The Server MUST compose this command, and the Control-
   Client MUST interpret this command, according to the field
   descriptions below.

   The Accept Field values are defined in OWAMP section 3.3 [RFC4656].

   number of SID fields that follow MUST be equal to the value in the
   Number of Sessions field.

   All SID fields are constructed as defined in the last paragraph of
   OWAMP section 3.5 [RFC4656] (and referenced in TWAMP).  Note that the
   SID is assigned by the Server during the session request exchange.

   The message is terminated with a single block HMAC, as illustrated
   above.

   Note that the SIDs for all Sessions with the same 'Accept' code can
   be acknowledged using the same Start-N-Ack message.

   For example, say that the Server receives a Start-N-Sessions command
   for SIDs 1, 2, 3, and 4.  The Server determines that the resources
   for SID=3 are temporarily unavailable.  The Server responds with two
   Start-N-Ack commands with fields as follows:

   Accept = 0 Number of Sessions = 3 SIDs 1, 2, 4

   Accept = 5 Number of Sessions = 1 SID 3

3.4.  Stop-N-Sessions Command with Individual Session Control

   The Stop-N-Sessions command can only be issued by the Control-Client.
   The command MUST contain at least one SID.

   The TWAMP Stop-N-Sessions command for use in Individual Session
   Control mode is formatted as follows:

   The Command Number value of 9 indicates that this is a Stop-N-
   Sessions command.  The Control-Client MUST compose this command, and
   the Server MUST interpret this command, according to the field
   descriptions below.

   The Number of sessions field indicates the count of sessions that
   this Stop-N-Sessions command applies to.  The SID is as defined in
   OWAMP (and TWAMP) section 3.5 [RFC4656] and the value must be one or
   greater.  The number of SID fields that follow MUST be equal to the
   value in the Number of Sessions field.

   The message is terminated with a single block HMAC, as illustrated
   above.

   The Server MUST respond with one or more Stop-N-Ack messages (which
   SHOULD be sent as quickly as possible).  Stop-N-Ack messages SHALL
   have the format defined in the next session.

3.5.  Stop-N-Ack Command with Individual Session Control

   In response to the Stop-N-Sessions command (for one or more specific
   sessions referenced by their SIDs), the Server MUST reply with one or

   more Stop-N-Ack commands with Accept fields corresponding to one or
   more of the SIDs.  This allows for the possibility that a Server
   cannot immediately stop one or more the sessions referenced in a
   particular Stop-N-Sessions command, but can stop one or more of the
   sessions.

   The format for the Stop-N-Ack command is as follows:

   0                   1                   2                   3

   The Command Number value of 10 indicates that this is a Stop-N-Ack
   message.  The Server MUST compose this command, and the Control-
   Client MUST interpret this command, according to the field
   descriptions below.

   The Accept Field values are defined in OWAMP section 3.3 [RFC4656].

   The Number of Sessions field indicates the count of sessions that
   this Stop-N-Ack command applies to, and must be one or greater.  The
   number of SID fields that follow MUST be equal to the value in the
   Number of Sessions field.

   All SID fields are constructed as defined in the last paragraph of
   OWAMP section 3.5 [RFC4656] (and referenced in TWAMP).  Note that the

Internet-Draft            TWAMP Session Control            February 2010


   SID is assigned by the Server during the session request exchange.

   The message is terminated with a single block HMAC, as illustrated
   above.

   Note that the SIDs for all Sessions with the same 'Accept' code can
   be acknowledged using the same Stop-N-Ack message.

3.6.  SERVWAIT Timeout Operation

   Section 3.1 of [RFC5357] describes the operation of the optional
   SERVWAIT timer.  In normal TWAMP operation, the Server suspends
   monitoring the SERVWAIT timer while test sessions are in progress.
   When the Individual Session Control feature is utilized, this
   suspension is extended to cover the time when ANY test session is in
   progress.

   Thus, the Server SHALL suspend monitoring control connection activity
   after receiving any Start-N-Sessions command, and after receiving a
   Stop-N-Sessions command for all corresponding SIDs (and no test
   sessions are in-progress), OR when REFWAIT expires on ALL test
   sessions initiated by a TWAMP-Control connection, then the SERVWAIT
   monitoring SHALL resume (as though a Stop-N-Sessions command had been
   received).  An implementation which supports the SERVWAIT timeout
   option SHOULD also implement the REFWAIT timeout option.

   The diagram below illustrates the operation of timers SERVWAIT and
   REFWAIT.

3.7.  Additional considerations

   The value of the Modes field sent by the Server (in the Server
   Greeting message) is the bit-wise OR of the mode values that it is
   willing to support during this session.

   With the publication of this feature, bit positions 0 through (Z=4)
   of the Modes 32-bit field are used.  A Control-Client MAY ignore bit
   positions greater than 2 in the Modes Field, or it MAY support
   OPTIONAL features that are communicated in bit positions 3 and
   higher.  (The unassigned bits are available for future protocol
   extensions.)

   Other ways in which TWAMP extends OWAMP are described in [RFC5357].


4.  TWAMP Test with Individual Session Control

   The TWAMP test protocol is similar to the OWAMP [RFC4656] test
   protocol with the exception that the Session-Reflector transmits test
   packets to the Session-Sender in response to each test packet it
   receives.  TWAMP [RFC5357] defines two different test packet formats,
   one for packets transmitted by the Session-Sender and one for packets
   transmitted by the Session-Reflector.  As with OWAMP-Test protocol
   there are three security modes: unauthenticated, authenticated, and
   encrypted.  Unauthenticated mode has one test packet format, while
   authenticated and encrypted modes use another (common) format.

4.1.  Sender Behavior

   The individual session control feature requires that the sender MUST
   manage test sessions according to their SID.  Otherwise, the sender
   behavior is as described in section 4.1 of [RFC5357].

4.2.  Reflector Behavior

   The TWAMP Reflector follows the procedures and guidelines in section
   4.2 of [RFC5357], with the following additional functions required by
   this feature:

   o  The Session-Reflector MUST manage all test sessions accepted
      according to their SID.

   o  Upon receipt of a TWAMP-Control Stop-N-Sessions command
      referencing a specific session/SID, the Session-Reflector MUST
      ignore TWAMP-Test packets (in the same session/SID) that arrive at
      the current time plus the Timeout (in the Request-TW-Session
      command and assuming subsequent acknowledgement).  The Session-



Morton & Chiba          Expires September 1, 2010              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft            TWAMP Session Control            February 2010


      Reflector MUST NOT generate a test packet to the Session-Sender
      for packets that are ignored.

   o  If the RECOMMENDED REFWAIT timer is implemented, it SHOULD be
      enforced when any test session is in-progress (started and not
      stopped).


5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of
   live networks are relevant here as well.  See the security
   considerations in[RFC4656] and [RFC5357].


6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo requests assignment of one mode bit position/value to the
   IANA registry for the TWAMP Mode field, and describes behavior when
   the new mode is used.  This field is a recognized extension mechanism
   for TWAMP.

   This memo also requests assignment of four command numbers in the
   TWAMP-Control Command Number registry, and describes the use of the
   new commands.  The command number field is a recognized extension
   mechanism for TWAMP.

6.1.  Registry Specification

   IANA has created a TWAMP-Modes registry (as requested in [RFC5618]).
   TWAMP-Modes are specified in TWAMP Server Greeting messages and
   Set-up Response messages, as described in section 3.1 of [RFC5357],
   consistent with section 3.1 of [RFC4656], and extended by this memo.
   Modes are indicated by setting bits in the 32-bit Modes field.  Thus,
   this registry can contain a total of 32 possible values.

   IANA has also created a TWAMP-Control Command Number registry.
   TWAMP-Control commands are specified by the first octet in TWAMP-
   Control messages as specified in section 3.5 of [RFC5357], and
   augmented by this memo.  This registry may contain 256 possible
   values.

6.2.  Registry Management

   Because the TWAMP-Control Command Number registry can contain only
   256 values and TWAMP-Modes can only contain thirty-two values, and
   because TWAMP is an IETF protocol, these registries must be updated
   only by "IETF Consensus" as specified in [RFC5226] (an RFC

Internet-Draft            TWAMP Session Control            February 2010


   documenting registry use that is approved by the IESG).  Management
   of these registries is described in section 8.2 of [RFC5357] and
   [RFC5618].

   This memo proposes assignment of values 7, 8, 9 and 10 in the Command
   number Registry, and the next available bit position (indicated by
   "Z") and corresponding value (indicated by "zzz") in sections 3.1 and
   3.7 above.  Note that these values should be replaced by IANA or the
   RFC Editor when assigned.

6.3.  Experimental Numbers

   One experimental value has been assigned in the TWAMP-Control Command
   Number registry.

   No additional experimental values are assigned in the TWAMP-Modes
   registry.

6.4.  Registry Contents
