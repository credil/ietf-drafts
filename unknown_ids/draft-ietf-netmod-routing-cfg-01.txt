              A YANG Data Model for Routing Configuration
                    draft-ietf-netmod-routing-cfg-01

Abstract

   This document contains a specification of three YANG modules that
   together provide a data model for essential configuration of a
   routing subsystem.  It is expected that this module will serve as a
   basis for further development of data models for individual routing
   protocols and other related functions.  The present data model
   defines the common building blocks for such configurations - router
   instances, routes, routing tables, routing protocols and route
   filters.

Internet-Draft         YANG Routing Configuration         September 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document contains an initial specification of three YANG
   modules:

   o  Module "ietf-routing" provides generic components of a routing
      data model.

   o  Module "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing" augments the "ietf-routing"
      module with additional data specific to IPv4 unicast.

   o  Module "iana-afn-safi" contains two type definitions translating
      IANA registries "Address Family Numbers" [IANA-AFN] and
      "Subsequent Address Family Identifiers" [IANA-SAFI] to YANG
      enumerations.

   ED.  QUESTION: Would it be possible/useful to publish the "iana-afn-
   safi" module as a separate I-D, perhaps together with "iana-if-type"?

   The first two modules together define the so-called core routing data
   model.  This data model will serve as a basis for the development of
   data models for more sophisticated routing configurations.  While
   these two modules can be directly used for simple IPv4-only devices
   with static routing, their main purpose is to provide essential
   building blocks for more complicated setups involving other address
   families such as IPv6, multicast routing, multiple routing protocols,
   and advanced functions such as route filtering or policy routing.  To
   this end, it is expected that this module will be augmented by
   numerous modules developed by other IETF working groups.

   active route:  a route which is actually used for packet forwarding.
      If there are multiple candidate routes with a matching destination
      prefix, then it is up to the routing algorithm to select the
      active route.

   core routing data model:  YANG data model resulting from the
      combination of "ietf-routing" and "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing-cfg"
      modules.

2.2.  Prefixes in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes are used mostly without a
   prefix, as long as it is clear from the context in which YANG module
   each name is defined.  Otherwise, names are prefixed with their
   standard prefix associated with the corresponding YANG module, as
   shown in Table 1.

3.  Objectives

   The initial design of the core routing data model was driven by the
   following objectives:

   o  The data model should be suitable for the common address families,
      in particular IPv4 and IPv6, and for unicast and multicast
      routing, as well as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS).

   o  Simple routing setups, such as static routing, should be
      configurable in a simple way, ideally without any need to develop
      additional YANG modules.

   o  On the other hand, the core routing framework must allow for
      complicated setups involving multiple routing tables and multiple
      routing protocols, as well as controlled redistributions of
      routing information.

   o  Device vendors will want to map the data models built on this
      generic framework to their proprietary data models and
      configuration interfaces.  Therefore, the framework should be
      flexible enough to facilitate such a mapping and accommodate data
      models with different logic.

4.  The Design of the Core Routing Data Model

   The core routing data model consists of two YANG modules.  The first
   module, "ietf-routing", defines the generic components of a routing
   system.  The second module, "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing", augments the
   "ietf-routing" module with new data nodes that are needed for IPv4
   unicast routing.

   The combined data hierarchy defined by both YANG modules is shown in
   Figure 1.

   several generic components of a routing framework: routers, routing
   tables containing routes, routing protocols, route filters and RPC
   operations.  The following subsections provide further details about
   these components.

   By combining the components in various ways, and possibly augmenting
   them with appropriate contents defined in other modules, various
   routing setups can be realized.

             Figure 2: Example setup of the routing subsystem

   Figure 2 shows an example of a more complicated setup.  Several of
   its features are worth mentioning:

   o  Along with the main routing table, which must always be present,
      an additional routing table is configured.

   o  Each routing protocol instance, including the "static" and
      "direct" pseudo-protocols, is connected to exactly one routing

      table with which it can exchange routes (in both directions,
      except for the "static" and "direct" pseudo-protocols).

   o  Routing tables may also be connected to each other and exchange
      routes in one or both directions.

   o  The forwarding information base (FIB) is a special routing table
      which must always be present.  Typically, the FIB receives the
      active routes from the main routing table and the operating system
      kernel uses this information for packet forwarding.

   o  Route exchanges along all connections may be controlled by means
      of route filters, denoted by "F" in Figure 2.

4.1.  Router

   Each router instance in the core routing data model represents a
   (virtual) router whose configuration and operation is independent of
   other router instances.  Although it it not enforced by the data
   model, different router instances normally do not internally share
   any data.  They may, however, communicate with each other via routing
   protocols.

4.2.  Route

   Routes are basic units of information in a routing system.  The core
   routing data model defines only the following minimal set of route
   attributes:

   o  destination-prefix - IP prefix specifying the set of destination
      addresses for which the route may be used.  This attribute is
      mandatory.

   o  next-hop - IP address of the adjacent router or host to which
      packets with destination addresses belonging to destination-prefix
      should be sent.

   o  outgoing-interface - network interface that should be used for
      sending packets with destination addresses belonging to
      destination-prefix.

   The above list of route attributes is sufficient for a simple static
   routing configuration.  It is expected that future modules defining
   routing protocols will add other route attributes such as metrics or
   preferences.

   Routes and their attributes are used in both configuration data, for
   example as manually configured static routes, and in operational

Internet-Draft         YANG Routing Configuration         September 2011


   state data, for example as entries in routing tables.

4.3.  Routing Tables

   Routing tables are lists of routes complemented with administrative
   data, namely:

   o  source-protocol - name of the routing protocol from which the
      route was originally obtained.

   o  last-modified - date and time of last modification, or
      installation, of the route.

   In the core routing data model, the contents of routing tables (list
   of routes) are defined as operational state data.  Routing protocol
   operations result in route additions, removals and modifications.
   This also includes manipulations via the "static" pseudo-protocol.

   At least the following two routing tables MUST be configured for each
   router instance:

   1.  Forwarding information base (FIB) contains active routes that are
       used by the operating system kernel for forwarding datagrams.

   2.  Main routing table to which all routing protocol instances are
       connected by default.

   The main routing table SHOULD serve as the source of active routes
   for the FIB.

   One or more additional routing tables MAY be configured by creating
   new entries in the "routing-table" list, either being a part of
   factory-default configuration or configured by the client.

   The naming scheme for routing tables, as well as restrictions on the
   number and configurability of routing tables are implementation-
   specific.

   Every routing table can serve as a source of routes for other routing
   tables.  To achieve this, one or more recipient routing tables may be
   specified in the configuration of the source routing table.  In
   addition, a route filter may be configured for each recipient routing
   table, which selects and/or manipulates the routes that are passed on
   between the source and recipient routing table.

4.4.  Routing Protocols

   The core routing data model provides an open-ended framework for
   defining multiple routing protocol instances.  Each of them is
   identified by a name, which MUST be unique within a router instance,
   and MUST be assigned a type from a selection which includes all
   routing protocol types supported by the server, such as static, RIP,
   OSPF or BGP.

   Each routing protocol instance is connected to exactly one routing
   table.  By default, every routing protocol instance is connected to
   the main routing table, but any routing protocol instance can be
   configured to use a different routing table, provided such an extra
   table exists.

   Routes learned from the network by a routing protocol are passed to
   the connected routing table and vice versa - routes appearing in a
   routing table are passed to all routing protocols connected to the
   table (except "direct" and "static" pseudo-protocols) and advertised
   by that protocol to the network.

   Two independent route filters (see Section 4.5) may be defined for a
   routing protocol instance to control the exchange of routes in both
   directions between the routing protocol instance and the connected
   routing table:

   o  import filter controls which routes are passed from a routing
      protocol instance to the routing table,

   o  export filter controls which routes the routing protocol instance
      may receive from the connected routing table.

   Note that, for historical reasons, the terms import and export are
   used from the viewpoint of a routing table.

   The "ietf-routing" module defines two special routing protocols -
   "direct" and "static".  Both are in fact pseudo-protocols, which
   means that they are confined to the local device and do not exchange
   any routing information with neighboring routers.  Routes from both
   "direct" and "static" protocol instances are passed to the connected
   routing table (subject to route filters, if any), but an exchange in
   the opposite direction is not allowed.

   Every router instance MUST contain exactly one instance of the
   "direct" pseudo-protocol.  It is the source of routes to directly
   connected networks (so-called direct routes).  Such routes are
   supplied by the operating system kernel, based on the detected and
   configured network interfaces, and they usually appear in the main

   routing table.  However, using the framework defined in this
   document, the target routing table for direct routes can be changed
   by connecting the "direct" protocol instance to a non-default routing
   table, and the direct routes can also be filtered before they appear
   in the routing table.

   The "static" routing pseudo-protocol allows for specifying routes
   manually.  It MAY be configured in zero or multiple instances,
   although a typical implementation will have exactly one instance.

4.4.1.  Defining New Routing Protocols

   It is expected that future YANG modules will create data models for
   additional routing protocol types.  In order to do so, the new module
   has to define the protocol-specific information and fit it to the
   core routing framework in the following way:

   o  A new identity MUST be defined for the routing protocol and its
      base identity MUST be set to "rt:routing-protocol", or to an
      identity derived from "rt:routing-protocol".

   o  Additional route attributes MAY be defined.  Their definitions
      then have to be inserted as operational state data by augmenting
      the definition of "rt:route" inside "rt:routing-table", and
      possibly to other places in configuration data and RPC input or
      output.

   o  The recommended way of defining configuration data specific to a
      new protocol is to augment the "routing-protocol" list entry with
      a container that encapsulates the configuration hierarchy of the
      new protocol.  The "augment" statement SHOULD be made conditional
      by using a "when" substatement requiring that the new nodes be
      used only if the "type" leaf node is equal to the new protocol's
      identity.

   The above steps are implemented by the example YANG module for the
   RIP routing protocol in Appendix A.  First, the module defines a new
   identity for the RIP protocol:

   identity rip {
     base rt:routing-protocol;
     description "Identity for the RIP routing protocol.";
   }

   Second, new route attributes specific for the RIP protocol ("metric"
   and "tag") are defined in a grouping and then added to route
   definitions appearing in "routing-table" and in the output part of
   "get-route" RPC method:

   grouping route-content {
     description
       "RIP-specific route content.";
     leaf metric {
       type rip-metric;
     }
     leaf tag {
       type uint16;
       default "0";
       description
         "This leaf may be used to carry additional info, e.g. AS
          number.";
     }
   }

   augment "/rt:routing/rt:router/rt:routing-tables/rt:routing-table/"
         + "rt:routes/rt:route" {
     when "../../../../rt:routing-protocols/"
        + "rt:routing-protocol[rt:name=current()/rt:source-protocol]/"
        + "rt:type='rip:rip'" {
       description
         "This augment is only valid if the source protocol from which
          the route originated is RIP.";
     }
     description
       "RIP-specific route components.";
     uses route-content;
   }

   augment "/rt:get-route/rt:output/rt:route" {
     description
       "Add RIP-specific route content.";
     uses route-content;
   }

   The "when" substatement in the first "augment" guarantees that the
   new route attributes are only valid when the source protocol is RIP.

   Finally, RIP-specific configuration data are integrated into the "rt:
   routing-protocol" node by using the following "augment" statement,
   which applies only to routing protocol instances whose type is "rip:
   rip":

   augment "/rt:routing/rt:router/rt:routing-protocols/"
         + "rt:routing-protocol" {
     when "rt:type = 'rip:rip'";
     container rip-configuration {
       container rip-interfaces {
         list rip-interface {
           key "name";
           leaf name {
             type if:interface-ref;
           }
           leaf enabled {
             type boolean;
             default "true";
           }
           leaf metric {
             type rip-metric;
             default "1";
           }
         }
       }
       leaf update-interval {
         type uint8 {
           range "10..60";
         }
         units "seconds";
         default "30";
         description
           "Time interval between periodic updates.";
       }
     }
   }

4.5.  Route Filters

   The core routing data model provides a skeleton for defining route
   filters that can be used to restrict the set of routes being
   exchanged between a routing protocol instance and a routing table, or
   between a source and a recipient routing table.  Route filters may
   also manipulate routes, i.e., add, delete, or modify their
   properties.

   By itself, the route filtering framework defined in this document
   allows to establish only the two extreme routing policies in which
   either all routes are allowed or all routes are rejected.  It is
   expected that real route filtering framework(s) will be developed
   separately.

   Each route filter is identified by a name which MUST be unique within

   a router instance.  Its type MUST be specified by the "type" identity
   reference - this opens the space for multiple route filtering
   framework implementations.  The default value for route filter type
   is the identity "deny-all-route-filter" defined in the "ietf-routing"
   module, which represents a route filtering policy in which all routes
   are rejected.

4.6.  RPC Operation

   The "ietf-routing" module defines the "get-route" RPC operation.  It
   is used for querying the forwarding information base of a router
   instance.  The first input parameter is the name of the router
   instance whose FIB is to be queried, and the second parameter is a
   destination address.  Modules for particular address families are
   expected to augment the "destination-address" container with the
   "address" leaf, as it is done in the "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing"
   module.

   The server replies with an active route which is used for forwarding
   datagrams to the destination address within the selected router
   instance.  Again, modules for particular address families are
   expected to augment the definition of output parameters with AFN/
   SAFI-specific contents.

9.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules defined in this document are designed to be accessed
   via the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the
   secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is SSH [RFC6242].

   A number of data nodes defined in the YANG modules are writable/
   creatable/deletable (i.e., "config true" in YANG terms, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations to these data nodes,
   such as "edit-config", can have negative effects on the network if
   the operations are not properly protected.

   The vulnerable "config true" subtrees and data nodes are the
   following:

   /rt:routing/rt:router/rt:routing-protocols/rt:routing-protocol  This
      list specifies the routing protocols configured on a device.

   /rt:routing/rt:router/rt:route-filters/rt:route-filter  This list
      specifies the configured route filters which represent the
      administrative policies for redistributing and modifying routing
      information.

   Unauthorized access to any of these lists can adversely affect the
   routing subsystem of both the local device and the network.  This may
   lead to network malfunctions, delivery of packets to inappropriate
   destinations and other problems.

Appendix A.  Example - Adding a New Routing Protocol

   This appendix demonstrates how the core routing data model can be
   extended to support a new routing protocol.  Appendix A.1 contains
   the YANG module which is used for this purpose.  It is intended only
   as an illustration and not as a real definition of a data model for
   the RIP routing protocol.  Also, for the sake of brevity, we do not
   follow all the guidelines specified in [RFC6087].

   Appendix A.2 then contains a complete instance XML document - a reply
   to the NETCONF <get> message from a server that uses the RIP protocol
   as well as static routing.

A.2.  Sample Reply to the NETCONF <get> Message

   This section contains a sample reply to the NETCONF <get> message,
   which could be sent by a server supporting (and advertising in the
   NETCONF <hello> message) the following YANG modules:

   o  ietf-interfaces [YANG-IF],

   o  ex-ethernet [YANG-IF],

   o  ietf-ip [YANG-IP],

   o  ietf-routing (Section 6),

   o  ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing (Section 7),

   o  example-rip (Appendix A.1).

   We assume a simple network setup as shown in Figure 3: routers "ISP"
   and "A" use RIP for exchanging routing information whereas static
   routing is used in the private network.  In order to avoid the
   redistribution of the routes to the private subnetworks
   192.168.1.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24 in RIP, an export filter is used in
   the RIP protocol configuration preventing the routes from the main
   routing table from appearing in RIP updates.

Appendix B.  Change Log

   RFC Editor: remove this section upon publication as an RFC.

B.1.  Changes Between Versions -00 and -01

   o  AFN/SAFI-independent stuff was moved to the "ietf-routing" module.

   o  Typedefs for AFN and SAFI were placed in a separate "iana-afn-
      safi" module.

   o  Names of some data nodes were changed, in particular "routing-
      process" is now "router".

   o  The restriction of a single AFN/SAFI per router was lifted.

   o  RPC operation "delete-route" was removed.

   o  Illegal XPath references from "get-route" to the datastore were
      fixed.

   o  Section "Security Considerations" was written.
