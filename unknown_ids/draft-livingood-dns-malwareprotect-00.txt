                DNS Redirect for Protection from Malware
                 draft-livingood-dns-malwareprotect-00

Abstract

   The objective of this document is to describe the design of so-called
   DNS-based malware protection services deployed today by Internet
   Service Providers (ISPs), DNS Application Service Providers (ASPs),
   and other organizations providing so-called DNS-based malware
   protection services via their recursive DNS services, as well as to
   describe the recommended practices regarding such systems.  This
   document specifically and narrowly addresses those cases where DNS
   Redirect is being utilized to provide a service for end users which
   blocks domains hosting malicious software.

1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   Internet users typically are provided with several IP addresses for
   recursive DNS servers, as described in Section 2.3 of [RFC1591], by
   their respective ISPs, typically in an automated fashion via DHCP
   [RFC2131].  Some other users and organizations choose to use a
   different set of IP address for their DNS servers, which are hosted
   and managed by another organization, such as a DNS ASP.  It is also
   the case that a number of users and organizations choose to operate
   their own DNS servers, though those use cases are outside of the
   scope of this document.

   ISPs and DNS ASPs have discovered over time that their users would
   like &quot enhanced &quot DNS services which can protect those users
   from reaching domains or fully qualified domain names (FQDNs, Section
   5.1 of [RFC1035]) that would cause a user to inadvertently access
   malicious software, otherwise known simply as malware.

   This document describes the design and function of a DNS-based
   malware protection service which only provides protection from
   domains hosting malware, as well as recommended practices and
   practices to avoid.


3.  Document Scope

   This document focuses on the systems and practices of ISPs and DNS
   ASPs.  All other use cases, such as when an Internet user or
   organization chooses to operate their own DNS servers is outside of
   the scope of this document.

   There are several ways that such entities can provide users with
   these enhanced DNS services.  In addition to methods which rely
   primarily upon a recursive DNS server, alternate methods include (a)
   interception and replacement of a malware-hosting domain or FQDN by
   web browser client software, (b) interception and replacement of a
   malware-hosting domain or FQDN by a tool bar, plug-in, personal
   firewall security software or other web browser client add-on.  These
   alternate methods, which rely upon various types of client software,
   are also outside of the scope of this document.

   It is important to note that while these alternate methods are
   considered out of scope for this document, this should not be
   interpreted as a negative judgment of their suitability or
   applicability to the relevant problem space.  Instead, these should
   simply be considered as alternate methods since, as with most any
   technical problem, there are a variety of valid methods for solving a
   problem.

   While the Section 6 section indicates that users must be able to opt
   into or out of DNS-based malware protection services, the reasons for
   why an ISP or DNS ASP may choose one or the other as the default are
   out of scope.

   Lastly, in the Section 5 section of this document, the method by
   which FQDNs, domains, and/or sites are added or removed from malware
   lists is outside the scope of this document.  [EDITORIAL NOTE: THIS
   MAY CHANGE IN A FUTURE VERSION OF THE DOCUMENT]


4.  Terminology

   While these terms are generally well known, it is important to define
   them in the context of this document.

4.1.  Internet Service Provider (ISP)

   An Internet Service Provider, which provides Internet services,
   including basic network connectivity.  It is not germane to this
   document what the method of connection is, such as wired or wireless,
   what the speed of such a connection is, or what other services are
   included or available to users.  It is, however, assumed that the ISP
   is providing recursive DNS services to their users and is in some
   manner providing users with the IP addresses of these DNS servers,
   whether via DHCP, static assignment by users, or some other method.

4.2.  DNS Application Service Provider (ASP)

   A DNS Application Service Provider, which provides managed and/or
   hosted recursive DNS services (and possibly other DNS services) to
   their users.  In the case of managed services, the DNS ASP may
   remotely manage the recursive DNS servers in a user's network.  For a
   hosted recursive DNS service, these servers are typically located
   outside of the user's network and these hosted resources are shared
   across multiple users.  In most instances, these are hosted services
   and users are manually configuring either their DHCP server or their
   individual computing devices with the IP addresses of the recursive
   DNS servers operated by their ASP.

Internet-Draft  DNS Redirect for Protection from Malware  September 2010


4.3.  Internet User

   An Internet user, which is generally a person using a computing
   device to connect to and make use of the Internet.  Such users are
   typically connected at the edge of the network, though the method by
   which they connect to the Internet is not particularly relevant to
   this document.

4.4.  DNS Recursive Resolver

   A DNS recursive resolver processes fully qualified domain name
   queries (FQDN, Section 5.1 of [RFC1035]) into IP addresses by finding
   the resource records in the authoritative DNS servers for the domain
   associated with the FQDN.  The resource records are then cached on
   the recursive server for future requests until an expiration timer
   expires called time to live (TTL), as described in Section 5.2 of
   [RFC2181].  These servers are in most cases provided by ISPs for name
   resolution.

4.5.  Web Browser

   Client software operated by the user locally on their computing
   device, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Apple
   Safari, Google Chrome, etc.

4.6.  Malicious Domain Web Error Landing Server

   The web server that a user's web browser is directed to when the DNS
   Recursive Server matches a DNS query to a malicious domain or FQDN.
   The contents of the web page that the web server sends the user
   varies widely across different ISPs and DNS ASPs.  In most cases it
   simply explains that the attempted URL contains malware and that
   access has been prevented, though there are many other possibilities.

4.7.  User Options Web Server

   The web server that a user is directed to via a link on a page served
   by the Web Error Landing Server, the Malicious Domain Web Error
   Landing Server, from another system such as an account management
   system, or via direct access, which enables a user to control whether
   or not they are opted into or opted out of DNS-based malware
   protection services.  This is described in additional detail in the
   Section 6 section.

4.8.  NXDOMAIN Response

   In this document, an NXDOMAIN (nonexistent domain) response can be
   used interchangeably with an RCODE 3 response.  The RCODE 3 response



Creighton, et al.         Expires March 8, 2011                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft  DNS Redirect for Protection from Malware  September 2010


   was first documented in see Section 4.1.1 of [RFC1035]).  Subsequent
   RFCs introduced the term NXDOMAIN response, which is synonymous with
   RCODE 3 and tends to be used more frequently, as noted in Section 2.2
   of [RFC2136], Section 1 of [RFC2308], and Section 5.4 of [RFC2535].


5.  Malicious Site Protection

   Malware websites have proliferated recently, making malware and bot
   networks a major problem for users.  In many cases, the initial
   contact with a virus or malware occurs when an unsuspecting user
   visits a particular website.  This has even been observed to occur
   when a user visits an otherwise legitimate website, which contains
   external references that happen to contain malware, for example (such
   as advertisements served by a third party).  Many organizations
   maintain lists of domains and FQDNs which host malware.

5.1.  Malicious Site Protection Problem Statement

   A user, malware agent, or bot requests a URL www.example.net or
   domain example.net.  This site is associated with distributing
   malware or some other malicious activity that would not be desired by
   the user.  The correct IP address is returned by the DNS and the user
   accesses the malware site or domain and their computer is infected
   with a bot.

5.2.  Malicious Site Protection Solution Description

   By using Malicious Site Protection, a user may have their DNS
   response redirected from the IP address for the malicious URL
   www.example.net or domain example.net to a safe website that explains
   why the user was redirected.  Importantly, the application attempting
   to access a malicious resource may or may not be a web browser and,
   further, may be operating without the user's knowledge and/or
   permission.  This page on the aforementioned safe website that the
   user is directed to may also provide the user with a link to a method
   of opting out in the future.  See Figure 3 and Figure 9 for examples
   below.  There may also be limited cases where it could be harmful to
   the objective of Malicious Site Protection to redirect the user to a
   safe website, in which case the user may not be directed to any
   resource, and a NXDOMAIN response be provided.

5.3.  Malicious Site Protection Solution Considerations

   It is important to note that this technology can directly impact non-
   web clients such as instant messaging, VPNs, FTP, email filters-
   related DNS queries.  Thus, special exclusions may need to be made in
   order to prevent unintentional side effects.  Design considerations



Creighton, et al.         Expires March 8, 2011                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft  DNS Redirect for Protection from Malware  September 2010


   for the Web Error Search and Malicious Site Protection services
   should include properly and promptly terminating non-HTTP connection
   requests.  A range of resource records may be redirected, such as A,
   AAAA, MX, SRV, and NAPTR records, in order to fulfill the objective
   of preventing access to certain network elements containing malicious
   content or which and in some way used to transmit, relay, or
   otherwise transfer malicious content.  All other resource record
   types must be answered as if there was no redirection.

   Malicious domain protection is also only effective if a user is
   actually using the DNS IP addresses that have this functionality.
   Thus, should a user's computer become compromised with some type of
   bot or virus that changes their DNS IP addresses (typically without
   their knowledge), the malicious domain protection would have no
   effect since the user is now pointed to DNS servers which are
   presumably in the control of a third party with malicious intentions.


6.  Opt-In or Opt-Out Mechanisms

   ISPs and DNS ASPs MUST provide their users with a method to opt into
   (opt-in) or out (opt-out) of some or all DNS-based malware protection
   services.  Opt-out and opt-in methods should be reliable and should
   take into consideration the Section 7 section below.  Whether such
   services are offered on an opt-in or opt-out basis depends on a range
   of factors which are outside of the scope of this document.  The two
   different methods, opt-out and opt-in, are described below.

6.1.  Opt-Out

   Opt-Out is used when the users are by default offered all or some
   DNS-based malware protection services.  As a result, the user must
   take an action to disable some or all such services.  This is
   typically performed via a User Options Web Server.  Users that have
   chosen to opt-out should receive DNS responses which are
   indistinguishable from those responses provided by a DNS server with
   no DNS Redirect functionality.  In addition, opt-out should be
   persistent in nature, which means that opt-out should be tied to a
   fixed credential or attribute of some type, such as an account
   identifier, billing identifier, or equipment identifier, which is not
   typically subject to change on a regular basis.

6.2.  Opt-In

   Opt-In is used when the users are by default not offered any DNS-
   based malware protection services.  As a result, the user must take
   an action to enable some or all such services.  This is typically
   performed via a User Options Web Server.

Internet-Draft  DNS Redirect for Protection from Malware  September 2010


6.3.  Automated Mechanisms and Reasonable Processing Times

   Once a user has selected to opt-in or opt-out of DNS-based malware
   protection services, such changes should occur automatically, when
   this is technically possible, without requiring the user to manually
   change any settings on their computing device.  Such changes should
   also occur within a reasonable period of time.  In some cases,
   however, a user may be offered the ability to speed the period of
   time for these changes to take effect, such as by restarting the
   computing device or a piece of network equipment which connects them
   to their ISP's network, for example.

   While an automated mechanism may be the easiest for users, since it
   requires no manual reconfiguration of their network settings, the
   authors also recognize that there may be extenuating circumstances
   where this is not achievable.  In such cases, which may for example
   be due to the particular attributes of one or another ISP's network
   design, a fully automated mechanism may not be possible.  Another
   example is where a user is switching from their ISP's DNS server IP
   addresses to those of a DNS ASP.  As a result, a user in all of these
   cases, as well as other possible cases, must manually reconfigure
   their network with different DNS IP addresses.

6.4.  Type of Opt-Out Method

   There are several workable methods that can be employed to effect the
   actual opt-out for a given user.  These include setting a local user
   application attribute, such as via a cookie in a web browser, as well
   as setting a network attribute, via a DHCP change or manually
   configuring the DNS IP addresses (in the operating system, modem,
   home gateway device, or router) in order to change the DNS IP
   addresses for a particular user.

   While all of these methods are workable and can be made reliable, the
   best current method is via a network-based change of some sort.  In
   this way, all Internet-connected computing devices within a given
   household are included in the opt-out (these devices are generally
   connected in some manner to the LAN side of some type of customer
   premise device, such as a cable modem or DSL modem).  This is in
   contrast to a method which uses a local user application attribute,
   such as a cookie in a web browser, where deletion of cookies, upgrade
   to a new operating system, upgrade to a new web browser, use of a
   different web browser, or countless other factors on that device
   could cause the user to be opted back into a DNS-based malware
   protection service.  Thus, a network-based approach which sets opt-
   out-related attributes at the device, or household level, is the most
   inclusive and persistent method for providing a reliable opt-out
   method, and is the recommended practice.

7.  Practices to Avoid

   This document primarily focuses on the recommended practices for an
   ISP or ASP to provide users with DNS-based malware protection
   services.  However, it is important to note that some entities may
   not operate in accordance with such practices.  As such, some of
   these are catalogued below in order to contrast them with recommended
   practices and provide information which may be of interest and use to
   the community.

7.1.  Use of DNS Redirect with DNSSEC

   When DNSSEC has been implemented in a service provider's resolvers,
   DNS redirect MUST NOT be used, as it is technically incompatible with
   DNSSEC and breaks the chain of trust critical to proper DNSSEC
   validation functionality.

7.2.  Improper Redirect of Valid Responses

   It has been observed that some service providers improperly utilize
   DNS-based malware protection services when there is a valid DNS
   resource record returned in response to a DNS recursive query.  The
   effect is to redirect users to a server not maintained by the
   intended destination, such as a web site that looks like the intended
   web site but is not actually the intended site and is instead
   controlled by the service provider.  For example a DNS query for
   www.example.com results in a valid A record response, but this valid
   response is instead replaced with an A record controlled by the
   service provider.  In this case the intended server identified with
   the valid A record contained valid, lawful, non-malicious content,
   and there would otherwise appear to be no valid justification for a
   redirect to occur.  See Figure 12 for an example below.

   If there is a valid and reasonable justification for such a redirect
   to occur, examples of which are not currently known by the authors of
   this document, then the resulting connection to the server that the
   user has been redirected to should clearly and prominently disclose
   that this is not the intended site.  For example, in the case of an
   attempt by a user to connect to a web site, the site may contain a
   banner or frame which indicates that this is not the intended site or
   that the site is in some manner controlled by the service provider.
   In addition, such a notice should also offer a clear method to opt-
   out of this redirect function.

   Thus, to summarize, redirection of valid responses SHOULD NOT be
   performed.

Internet-Draft  DNS Redirect for Protection from Malware  September 2010


7.3.  Redirect of SERVFAIL Responses

   Redirection of SERVFAIL responses SHOULD NOT occur.  SERVFAIL
   responses may occur intermittently in an operational network for a
   variety of highly transient reasons.  As a result, a DNS Redirect
   should not be performed when a SERVFAIL response is received, as
   normal retry a short time later is likely to result in a valid
   response.

7.4.  Routinely Broken, Purposefully Broken, and Otherwise Unreliable
      Opt-Out Mechanisms

   There are several well known and dependable methods of opt-out
   mechanisms that ISPs and DNS ASPs can deploy for users to opt-out of
   their DNS-based malware protection services.  These methods can
   rather easily be employed and are highly recommended, as noted in
   Section 6.  However, some ISPs and DNS ASPs may instead choose to
   employ a less dependable mechanism, which routinely fails to work as
   expected by users or is known not to function properly.

   For example, one routinely unreliable method for opt-out is the
   cookie-based method.  When a user opts out of a DNS-based malware
   protection service, a cookie is installed in their web browser.  The
   problem with this method occurs when a user clears their cookies or
   the cookies are deleted for some reason.  In some cases, users may
   configure their web browsers to clear all cookies every time the
   close their web browser.  Thus, one possible effect upon the user in
   this case is that they are once again opted into the redirect
   service.  Furthermore, a cookie-based method has the effect of only
   opting out browser-based protocols (generally HTTP and HTTPS), which
   means that the user may have non-web applications affected by DNS
   Redirect, even though they believe they have opted-out.  As a result,
   there is no assured permanency with this opt-out method, nor does it
   work consistently across all applications and protocols, which can be
   aggravating to users who do not wish to utilize DNS-based malware
   protection services.

   Another example of an unreliable method for opt-out is one where opt-
   out is tied to the IP address of the user, where that address may be
   subject to change on a regular basis, such as via an ISP-based DHCP
   lease.  In such a case, if opt-out was tied to what can be considered
   a largely dynamic IP address, then the user would be opted-in every
   time they received a new IP address, forcing them to repeatedly opt-
   out.

   Thus, to summarize, the opt-out mechanism provided to users SHOULD be
   reliable and SHOULD NOT be routinely broken, purposefully broken, or
   otherwise unreliable.

7.5.  Markedly Slower DNS Query Performance

   An ISP or DNS ASP should also understand that DNS query latency, the
   time between when a user's stub resolver issues and DNS query and
   receives a DNS response, should be kept as low as is reasonably
   possible.  High DNS query latency is often perceived by users, and
   can have an adverse effect on a variety of applications where low DNS
   query latency may be especially important.  Any additional processing
   which must be performed in order to provide DNS-based malware
   protection services should be monitored closely, in order that DNS
   Redirect functionality does not markedly slow DNS query performance.

   Thus, to summarize, when DNS redirect is performed, DNS query
   performance SHOULD NOT suffer as a result, since this could provide
   an incrementally inferior user experience as compared to when DNS
   redirect is not performed.

7.6.  Override of a User's DNS Selection

   Some users may decide to use the DNS server IP addresses of a DNS ASP
   or other non-ISP-provided DNS servers.  Such selections should be
   preserved as the free choice of a user, particularly when DNS-based
   malware protection services are offered.  Thus, an ISP SHOULD NOT
   redirect port 53 DNS traffic from servers intended by the user via
   their selection of non-ISP DNS servers to the DNS servers of the ISP,
   except in reasonable and justifiable cases where a user has been
   placed into a so-called "walled garden" for reasons of abuse,
   security compromise, account non-payment, new service activation,
   etc.


8.  Functional Design

   The functional design described in this section is intended to be
   generally representative of the many different ways that DNS-based
   malware protection services are deployed today.  As such, they are
   necessarily high level and different implementations may vary
   somewhat, due to any number of factors.

8.1.  DNS Recursive Resolver

   The DNS Recursive Resolver is used by the host computer to translate
   fully qualified domain names into IP addresses, according to Section
   3.6.1 of [RFC1034].  When a FQDN does not exist in authoritative DNS
   a NXDOMAIN response, as described in Section 4.1.1 of [RFC1035] is
   normally returned (see Figure 1).  In the case of DNS Redirect, the
   NXDOMAIN response is changed to reply with a resource record (RR)
   response which instructs the host computer to send the original

8.2.  Web Error Landing Server

   When a user requests an invalid URL or Domain, their web client is
   redirected to a Web Error Landing Server which presents several
   possible helpful website views (see Figure 2).  The first is "Did you
   mean..." response which presents the user with possible correct
   results based on their original invalid request.  The search server
   can also present search engine results to the user.

8.3.  Web Browser Client

   The Web Browser Client is redirected to a Web Server Landing Page
   instead of presenting an error page when there is no valid DNS record
   present.

   Examples of common Web Browser Clients include:

   o  Microsoft Internet Explorer

   o  Mozilla Firefox

   o  Apple Safari

   o  Google Chrome

   o  Opera

8.4.  Domain White List

   There may be certain domains which should be not be redirected under
   any circumstances for legal, business, or other reasons.  The Domain
   White List can contain both domains, such as *.example.com, as well
   as specific FQDNs, such as www.example.com.  For instance, the owner
   of example.com may request that the ISP or DNS ASP not perform DNS
   Redirect for the example.com domain, so that there is no DNS Redirect
   resulting from queries to nonexistent names, such as
   invalid.example.com.

8.5.  Malicious Domain List

   Using a Malicious Domain List, a DNS server can redirect DNS requests
   that were intended for malicious websites or domains to a web server
   landing page (see Figure 3).  The Malicious Domain List can contain
   both domains, such as *.example.net, as well as specific FQDNs, such
   as www.example.net.

   Using a Content Protection List, a DNS server can redirect DNS
   requests that were intended for websites or domains containing
   content deemed inappropriate by a user, to a web server landing page

   contain both domains, such as *.inappropriate.example, as well as
   specific FQDNs, such as www.inappropriate.example.com.

9.7.  Improper Redirect of Valid Response Redirect and HTTP Flow

   This example represents an improper redirect occurring when a valid
   DNS RR should have been returned in response to a DNS recursive query
   for an example website, the resulting HTTP transaction, and that no
   DNS query or HTTP traffic was sent to the valid authoritative DNS
   server and valid web server.  Section 10 below shows one of the
   reasons why this practice is problematic.  Another reason is that a
   user intends to visit a valid resource with lawful and legitimate
   content, such as a web site, and is instead sent to a different
   destination (which may even closely resemble the intended site, in
   the pattern used by phishing sites).

   Figure 12: Improper Redirect of Valid Response Redirect and HTTP Flow


10.  DNSSEC Considerations

   DNS security extensions defined in [RFC4033], [RFC4034], and
   [RFC4035] use cryptographic digital signatures to provide origin
   authentication and integrity assurance for DNS data.  This is done by
   creating signatures for DNS data on a Security-Aware Name Server that
   can be used by Security-Aware Resolvers to verify the answers.  As
   the DNS redirections described herein take place on the recursive
   server there is no need to look into the communication between the
   recursive resolvers and name servers.  Depending on the security
   awareness of recursive server used to perform DNS-based malware
   protection services, as well as the security awareness of the stub
   resolvers the following impact is observed on DNS Redirect when
   giving out answers to fully secured zones or parent zones:

   o  Security-Oblivious Resolver with Validating and Non-Validating
      Stub Resolvers: Since the resolver is not security-aware, it will
      not pass any DNSSEC-related packets and, thus, even the validating
      stub resolver cannot validate the records and will present the DNS
      Redirect answers to the application.





Creighton, et al.         Expires March 8, 2011                [Page 23]

Internet-Draft  DNS Redirect for Protection from Malware  September 2010


   o  Security-Aware Resolver with Non-Validating Stub Resolver: As the
      security-aware resolver does not have the key generated the
      resource record signatures (RRSIG) for it's response it should
      give the redirected answer out as indeterminate or insecure.  As
      the stub resolver is not doing any validation it will use the DNS
      Redirect response and pass them on to the application.

   o  Security-Aware Resolver with Validating Stub Resolver: As the
      security-aware resolver does not have the key generated the
      resource record signatures (RRSIG) for it's response it should
      give the redirected answer out as indeterminate or insecure.
      However, as the validating stub has a DNSKEY record for the zone
      or a DS record for the parent zone it cannot validate the answer
      and will report it as bogus to the application leading to non-
      resolution for that domain.

   So the only case where DNS security extensions cause problems for DNS
   Redirect is with a validating stub resolver.  This case doesn't have
   widespread deployment now and could be mitigated by using trust
   anchor, configured by the applicable ISP or DNS ASP, that could be
   used to sign the redirected answers.  As noted above in Section 9.7,
   such improper redirection of valid responses may also cause DNSSEC
   trust verification problems.


11.  Security Considerations

   Security best practices should be followed regarding access to the
   opt-in and opt-out functions, in order that someone other than the
   user is able to change the user's DNS Redirect settings.  For
   example, the User Options Web Server must not permit someone to
   modify a page URI to access and change another user's options.  Thus,
   if the URI is
   "http://www.example.net/redirect-options.php?account=1234", someone
   must not be able to modify the account to be "=1235" and then be able
   to change the options for a different user with some other additional
   validation being performed.  While web site security practices are
   outside the scope of this document, the authors believe it is
   important to identify such problematic use cases to any ISPs and DNS
   ASPs offering and/or implementing DNS Redirect functionality.


12.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations in this document.

   1.  CRITICAL: THIS DOCUMENT HAS BEEN SPLIT OFF FROM A GENERAL DNS
       REDIRECT DOCUMENT.  THIS FIRST VERSION IS A SIMPLE REPURPOSING OF
       THE CONTENT FROM THE OLD DOCUMENT.  EXISTING AUTHORS NOW NEED TO
       PERFORM A FULL DOCUMENT REVIEW TO ENSURE THAT THE NEW CONTENT HAS
       CARRIED OVER CORRECTLY AND THAT IT MAKES SENSE AND THAT THEY
       STILL SUPPORT THE DOCUMENT AND CAN CONTRIBUTE TO IT.

   2.  REMOVE ALL LEGACY CONTENT REFERRING TO OTHER FORMS OF REDIRECTION
       THAT CARRIED OVER FROM THE OLD DOCUMENT

   3.  RW: Consider whether it is a good idea to add to section 4.9
       (NXDOMAIN RESPONSE) a reference to Authenticated Denial of
       Existence described in RFC4035 section 5.4 as these should be
       also redirected.

   4.  MB: Consider addressing how opt-out works when a user roams
       across a shared WiFi AP.

   5.  RH: Update reference to RFC2535, which is obsoleted by RFCs 4033,
       4034, 4035.

   6.  JL: Consider capitalizing RFC 2119 language used.

   7.  JL: What sort of DNSSEC section is needed?
