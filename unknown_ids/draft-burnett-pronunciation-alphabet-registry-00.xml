      <t>This document describes a new registry for Pronunciation Alphabets,
      such as pinyin, that can be used to describe pronunciations of words and
      phrases in a particular language.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Pronunciation Alphabet Registry contains a list of Pronunciation
      Alphabet tags. This allows implementers a straightforward and reliable
      way to validate Pronunciation Alphabet tags. The Pronunciation Alphabet
      Registry will be maintained so that it is possible to validate all of
      the Pronunciation Alphabet tags under the provisions of this document or
      its revisions or successors. In addition, the meaning of the various
      Pronunciation Alphabet tags will be unambiguous and stable over time.
      (The meaning of private use Pronunciation Alphabet, of course, is not
      defined here.)</t>

      <t>Pronunciation Alphabet tags can be used in the alphabet attribute of
      the phoneme element in the <xref
      target="W3C.CR-speech-synthesis11-20090827">Speech Synthesis Markup
      Language</xref>. At some point in the future they may also be usable
      within the alphabet attribute of the phoneme and lexicon elements in the
      <xref target="W3C.REC-pronunciation-lexicon-20081014">Pronunciation
      Lexicon Specification</xref>.</t>

        <t>The Pronunciation Alphabet Registry (PAR) consists of a text file
        including all registered Pronunciation Alphabet tags in the format
        defined in this section, plus copies of the registration forms
        approved in accordance with the process described in <xref
        target="sec.registrationProcedure"></xref>. The set of initial tags
        (see <xref target="sec.registration.pronunciation_alphabet"></xref>)
        will not have registration forms created for them.</t>

        <t>The format of the registry is described by the following ABNF (per
        <xref target="RFC5234">RFC5234</xref>):</t>

        </figure>

        <t>This format was based on the language tags format described in
        <xref target="RFC5646"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Each line of text is limited to 72 characters, including all
        whitespace. Records are separated by lines containing only the
        sequence "%%" (%x25.25).</t>

        <t>Each field can be viewed as a single, logical line of ASCII
        characters, comprising a field-name and a field-body separated by a
        COLON character (%x3A). For convenience, a field-body allowing text
        can be split into a multiple-line representation; this is called
        "folding".</t>

        <t>Characters from outside the US-ASCII <xref
        target="ISO.646.1991">ISO646</xref> repertoire, as well as the
        AMPERSAND character ("&amp;", %x26) when it occurs in field body text,
        are represented by a "Numeric Character Reference" using hexadecimal
        notation in the style used by <xref target="W3C.REC-xml-20081126">XML
        1.0</xref> (see &lt;http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#dt-charref&gt;).
        This consists of the sequence "&amp;#x" (%x26.23.78) followed by a
        hexadecimal representation of the character's code point in ISO 10646
        followed by a closing semicolon (%x3B). For example, the EURO SIGN,
        U+20AC, would be represented by the sequence "&amp;#x20AC;". Note that
        the hexadecimal notation MAY have between two and six digits.</t>

        <t>All fields whose field-body contains a date value use the
        "full-date" format specified in <xref target="RFC3339"></xref>. For
        example: "2004-06-28" represents June 28, 2004, in the Gregorian
        calendar.</t>

        <t>The first record in the file contains the single field whose
        field-name is "File-Date". The field-body of this record contains the
        last modification date of this copy of the registry, making it
        possible to compare different versions of the registry. The registry
        on the IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) website is the most
        current. Versions with an older date than that one are not
        up-to-date.</t>

        <t>Subsequent records represent tags in the registry. Each of the
        fields in each record MUST occur no more than once, unless otherwise
        noted below. Each record MUST contain the following fields unless
        otherwise noted:</t>

        <t><list hangIndent="15" style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Type"><vspace blankLines="0" />Type's field-value
            MUST consist of one of the strings "alphabet" or "alias", denoting
            the type of tag.</t>

            <t hangText="Tag"><vspace blankLines="0" />Tag's field-value
            contains a Pronunciation Alphabet tag.</t>

            <t hangText="Description"><vspace blankLines="0" />Description's
            field-value contains a non-normative description of the tag. This
            field MUST appear in records whose 'Type' is "alphabet" and MAY
            appear in records whose 'Type' is "alias".</t>

            <t
            hangText="Reference to published description of the pronunciation alphabet"><vspace
            blankLines="0" />This field-value contains normative information
            that identifies a reference defining the Pronunciation Alphabet
            associated with this tag, for example a national standard, an
            association's standard, a book, or an article. It is strongly
            RECOMMENDED that this reference be published, public, and stable.
            This field MUST appear in records whose 'Type' is "alphabet" and
            MUST NOT appear in records whose 'Type' is "alias".</t>

            <t hangText="Alias"><vspace blankLines="0" />Alias' field-value
            MUST be another registered Pronunciation Alphabet tag whose 'Type'
            is "alphabet". This field MUST appear in records whose 'Type' is
            "alias" and MUST NOT appear in records whose 'Type' is
            "alphabet".</t>

            <t hangText="Added"><vspace blankLines="0" />Added's field-value
            contains the date the record was added to the registry.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The 'Tag' field MUST use lowercase letters to form the tag.</t>

        <t>The field 'Description' MAY appear more than one time and contains
        a description of the tag in the record. At least one of the
        'Description' fields MUST be written or transcribed into the Latin
        script; the same or additional fields MAY also include a description
        in a non-Latin script.</t>

        <t>Note: The purpose of the "Reference to published description of the
        pronunciation alphabet" in the record is intended as an aid to people
        trying to verify whether a pronunciation alphabet is registered. The
        contents of this field SHOULD reference a published standard; if no
        such standard exists, other well known works describing that
        pronunciation alphabet MAY be provided instead. The Pronunciation
        Alphabet Tag Reviewer decides what constitutes "good enough" reference
        material.</t>

        <t>The field 'Alias' contains a mapping between the record in which it
        appears and another tag.</t>

        <t>A tag which is defined as an alias must always remain an alias,
        although the value of the Alias field may change.</t>

        <t>Each record MAY also contain the following fields:</t>

        <t></t>

        <t><list hangIndent="15" style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Deprecated"><vspace blankLines="0" />Deprecated's
            field-value contains the date the record was deprecated.</t>

            <t hangText="Comments"><vspace blankLines="0" />Comments contains
            additional information about the tag, as deemed appropriate for
            understanding the registry and implementing the associated
            Pronunciation Alphabet tag.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The field 'Deprecated' MAY be added to any record via the
        maintenance process described in <xref
        target="sec.maintenance"></xref>or via the registration process
        described in <xref target="sec.registrationProcedure"></xref>.
        Usually, the addition of a 'Deprecated' field is due to the action on
        the mailing list. Although valid as Pronunciation Alphabet tags, tags
        with a 'Deprecated' field are deprecated and document authors SHOULD
        NOT use these tags.</t>

        <t>The field 'Comments' MAY appear more than once per record. This
        field MAY be inserted or changed via the registration process and no
        guarantee of stability is provided. The content of this field is not
        restricted, except by the need to register the information, the
        suitability of the request, and by reasonable practical size
        limitations.</t>

        <t>The values for fields 'Tag' and 'Alias' MUST use the following
        syntax:</t>

        <t>The Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer moderates the
        &lt;ietf-par@iana.org&gt; mailing list, responds to requests for
        registration, and performs the other registry maintenance duties
        described in <xref target="sec.maintenance"></xref>. Except as
        described there, only the Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer is permitted
        to request IANA to change, update, or add records to the Pronunciation
        Alphabet Registry. The Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer MAY delegate
        list moderation and other clerical duties as needed.</t>

        <t>The Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer is appointed by the IESG for an
        indefinite term, subject to removal or replacement at the IESG's
        discretion. The IESG will solicit nominees for the position (upon
        adoption of this document or upon a vacancy) and then solicit feedback
        on the nominees' qualifications. Qualified candidates should be
        familiar with this document and its requirements; be willing to
        fairly, responsively, and judiciously administer the registration
        process; and be suitably informed about the issues of pronunciation
        alphabets so that the reviewer can assess the claims and draw upon the
        contributions of experts in the use and definition of pronunciation
        alphabets and tag requesters.</t>

        <t>The subsequent performance or decisions of the Pronunciation
        Alphabet Reviewer MAY be appealed to the IESG under the same rules as
        other IETF decisions (see <xref target="RFC2026">RFC2026</xref>). The
        IESG can reverse or overturn the decisions of the Pronunciation
        Alphabet Reviewer, provide guidance, or take other appropriate
        actions.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec.maintenance" title="Maintenance of the Registry">
        <t>The Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer MUST evaluate each suggested
        change, determine whether it conflicts with existing registry entries,
        and submit the information to IANA for inclusion in the registry. If a
        suggestion is submitted and the Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer does
        not do this in a timely manner, then any interested party MAY use the
        procedure in <xref target="sec.registrationProcedure"></xref> to
        register the appropriate update.</t>

        <t>The Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer MUST ensure that new tags meet
        the requirements in <xref target="sec.registrationProcedure"></xref>.
        When either a change or addition to the registry is needed, the
        Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer MUST prepare the complete record,
        including all fields, and forward it to IANA for insertion into the
        registry. Each record being modified or inserted MUST be forwarded in
        a separate message.</t>

        <t>If a record represents a new tag that does not currently exist in
        the registry, then the message's subject line MUST include the word
        "INSERT". If the record represents a change to an existing tag, then
        the subject line of the message MUST include the word "MODIFY".</t>

        <t>The message MUST contain both the record for the tag being inserted
        or modified and the new File-Date record. Here is an example of what
        the body of the message might contain:</t>

        <t>Whenever an entry is created or modified in the registry, the

        the most recent modification date in the <xref
        target="RFC3339"></xref> "full-date" format. Before forwarding a new
        registration to IANA, the Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer MUST ensure

      <section anchor="sec.stability"
               title="Stability of Pronunciation Alphabet Registry Entries">
        <t>The stability of entries and their meaning in the registry is
        critical to the long term stability of pronunciation alphabet tags.
        Once registered, a tag will not be removed from the registry and will
        remain a valid way in which to specify a specific pronunciation
        alphabet or variant. The rules in this section guarantee that a
        specific pronunciation alphabet tag's meaning is stable over time and
        will not change.</t>

        <t>While corrections to mistakes in the registry MAY be undertaken
        from time to time, attempts to provide translations or transcriptions
        of entries in the registry itself will probably be frowned upon by the
        community or rejected outright.</t>

        <t>Assignments to the Pronunciation Alphabet Registry MUST follow the

            description of the pronunciation alphabet' fields MUST NOT be
            changed in a way that would invalidate previously-existing tags.
            They MAY be broadened somewhat in scope, changed to add
            information, or adapted to the most common modern usage.</t>

            <t>The field 'Comments' MAY be added, changed, modified, or
            removed via the registration process or any of the processes or
            considerations described in this section.</t>

            <t>The field 'Alias' MAY be modified via the registration process

        <t>The procedure given here MUST be used by anyone who wants to use a

        <t>Registering a new tag or requesting modifications to an existing

        &lt;ietf-par@iana.org&gt; for a 90 day review period before it can be
        submitted to IANA. This is an open list and can be joined by sending a
        request to &lt;ietf-par-request@iana.org&gt;. Note that emails are not

        <t>When the 90 day period has passed the Pronunciation Alphabet
        Reviewer either forwards the record to be inserted or modified to
        IANA, with a CC to &lt;ietf-par@iana.org&gt;, according to the
        procedure described in <xref target="sec.maintenance"></xref>, or
        rejects the request because of significant objections raised on the
        list or due to problems with constraints in this document (which MUST
        be explicitly cited). The Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer MAY also
        extend the review period in 90 day increments to permit further
        discussion. The Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer MUST indicate on the
        list whether the registration has been accepted, rejected, or extended
        following each 90 day period.</t>

        <t>Note that the Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer MAY raise objections
        on the list if he or she so desires. The important thing is that the
        objection MUST be made publicly.</t>

        <t>The applicant is free to modify a rejected application with
        additional information and submit it again; this restarts the 90 day
        comment period.</t>

        <t>Individuals who disagree strongly with a decision SHOULD register
        with the Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer any Formal Objections. When
        individuals believe that their concerns are not being duly considered
        by the group, they MAY ask the IESG to confirm or deny the decision.
        The Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer MUST inform the IESG when a group
        participant has raised concerns about due process. Any requests to the
        IESG to confirm a decision MUST include a summary of the issue
        (whether technical or procedural), decision, and rationale for the
        objection. All counter-arguments, rationales, and decisions MUST be
        recorded. It is RECOMMENDED that all such communications include a CC
        to &lt;ietf-par@iana.org&gt;. The IESG can reverse or overturn the
        decision of the Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer, provide guidance, or
        take other appropriate actions.</t>

        <t>Updates or changes to existing records follow the same procedure as
        new registrations. The Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer decides whether
        there is consensus to update the registration following the 90 day
        review period; normally objections by the original registrant will
        carry extra weight in forming such a consensus.</t>

      <section title="Initialization of the Registries">
        <t>Upon adoption of this document an initial version of the
        Pronunciation Alphabet Registry is necessary. The initial
        Pronunciation Alphabet Registry contains the initial set of valid
        tags. This collection of tags is described in <xref
        target="sec.initial"></xref>.</t>

        <t>IANA SHALL publish the initial version of the registry described by
        this document from the content of <xref target="sec.initial"></xref>.
        Once published by IANA, the maintenance procedures, rules and
        registration processes described in this document will be available
        for new registrations or updates.</t>

      <section title="Choice of Pronunciation Alphabet Tags">
        <t>One is sometimes faced with the choice between several possible
        pronunciation alphabets for the same tag. It is strongly RECOMMENDED
        that the most widely accepted and used pronunciation alphabet is
        chosen for the specific tag. Pronunciation alphabets that refer to
        published national or association standards are preferred.</t>

        <t>Interoperability is best served when all users use the same
        pronunciation alphabet tag in order to represent the same
        pronunciation alphabet. If one pronunciation alphabet is registered
        with one tag, it MUST NOT be registered with other tags. The only
        exception to this is the use of Alias.</t>
