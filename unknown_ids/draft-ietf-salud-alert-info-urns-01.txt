       Alert-Info URNs for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
                  draft-ietf-salud-alert-info-urns-01

Abstract

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the capability to
   provide a reference to a specific rendering to be used by the UA when
   the user is alerted.  This is done using the Alert-Info header field.
   However, the reference addresses only network resources with specific
   rendering properties.  There is currently no support for predefined
   standard identifiers for describing the semantics of the alerting
   situation or the characteristics of the alerting signal, without
   being tied to a particular rendering.  To overcome this limitation
   and support new applications, a new family of URNs for use in SIP
   Alert-Info header fields is defined in this specification.

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs                  April 2011


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] includes a means to
   suggest to a user agent (UA) a particular ringback tone or ring tone
   to be used during session establishment.  In [RFC3261] this is done
   by including a URI in the Alert-Info header field, that specifies the
   tone.  The URI is most commonly the HTTP URL to the audio file.  On
   the receipt of the Alert-Info header field the user agent may fetch
   the referenced ringback tone or ring tone and play it to the user.

   This mechanism hinders interoperability when there is no common
   understanding of the meaning of the referenced tone, which might be
   country- or vendor-specific.  It can lead to problems for the user
   trying to interpret the tone and for the UA wanting to substitute its
   own tone (e.g., in accordance with user preferences) or provide an
   alternative alerting mode (e.g., for hearing-impaired users).  If
   caller and callee are from different countries, the understanding of
   the tones may vary significantly.  Hearing impaired users may not
   sense the specific tone if it is provided as an audio file.  The tone
   per se is also not useful for automata.

   There are currently interoperability issues around the use of the
   Alert-Info header field when not using an external ring file.  For
   example, consider the PBX special ring tone for an external (to the
   PBX) caller.  Different vendors use different approaches such as:
   Alert-Info: <file://ring.pcm>;alert=normal where ring.pcm is a dummy
   file or: Alert-Info: <file://normal.ring.pcm> or: Alert-Info:
   <sip:normal-ringtone@example.com>.  As a result, Alert-Info currently
   only works when the same vendor provides proxy and UA, as only then
   is the same "fake" proprietary URI convention used.

   Another limitation of the current solution is that the referenced
   tones are tied to particular rendering.  It is not possible to
   provide semantic indications or names for rendering characteristics
   that signals the intent and allows the recipient to decide how to
   render the received information in an appropriate way.

   To solve the described issues, this specification defines the new URN
   namespace 'alert' for the Alert-Info header field that allows for
   programmatic user interface adaptation and for conversion of
   equivalent alerting tones in the Public Switched Telephone Network
   (PSTN) when the client is a gateway.  The work to standardize an
   Alert-Info URN will increase SIP interoperability for this header
   field by replacing proprietary conventions used today.

   Using the 'alert' namespace provides syntax for several different

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs                  April 2011


   application spaces, e. g.:

   o  Names for service indications, such as call waiting or automatic
      callback, not tied to any particular rendering.

   o  Names for common ring tones generated by PBX phones for cases such
      as an internal enterprise caller, external caller, ringback tone
      after a transfer failure or expiration of a hold timer, etc.

   o  Names for country-specific ringback tones.

   o  Names for things with specific renderings that aren't purely
      audio.  They might be static icons, video sequences, text, etc.

   Some advantages of a URN rather than a URL of a downloadable
   resource:

   o  Do not need to download it or deal with security issues associated
      with dereferencing.

   o  No formatting or compatibility issues.

   o  No security risk of rendering something unexpected and
      undesirable.

   o  The tone can be stored locally in whatever format and at whatever
      quality level is appropriate, because it is specified "by name"
      rather than "by value".

   o  It is easier to make policy decisions about whether to use it or
      not.

   o  It facilitates translation for the hearing impaired.

   The downside is that if the recipient does not understand the URN
   then it will only be able to render a default ringback tone or ring
   tone.

   This document creates a new URN namespace and registry for alert
   indications and registers some initial values.

1.2.  Alert-Info Header Field Usage Change

   This specification changes the usage of the SIP Alert-Info header
   field defined in the [RFC3261] by additionally allowing its use in
   all provisional responses to INVITE (except the 100 response).

   In practice, this specification extends Alert-Info in that it will

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs                  April 2011


   cause the use of a new class of URIs and the use of multiple URIs.
   Backward compatibility issues are not expected, as devices that do
   not understand an Alert-Info URN should ignore it, and devices should
   not malfunction upon receiving multiple Alert-Info alert-params
   (which was syntactically permitted before, but rarely used).

1.3.  Terminology

   This specification uses a number of terms to refer to the roles
   involved in the use of alerting indications in SIP.  A "specifier"
   sends an "indication" or "identifier" (one or more URNs in an Alert-
   Info header) to a "renderer" which then "renders" a "signal" or
   "rendering" based on the indication to a human user.  A "category" is
   a characteristic whose "values" can be used to classify indications.

   This specification uses the terms "ring tone" and "ringback tone".  A
   "ring tone" or "calling signal" (terminology used in [ITU-T E.182])
   is a signal generated by the callee's end device, advising the callee
   about an incoming call.  A "ringback tone" or "ringing tone"
   (terminology used in [ITU-T E.182]) is a signal advising the caller
   that a connection has been made and that a ring tone is being
   rendered to the callee.


2.  Requirements

   This section discusses the requirements for an identifier to
   transport the semantics of the alerting situation or the
   characteristics of the rendering.

   REQ-1: The mechanism will allow user agents (UAs) and proxies to
   provide in the Alert-Info header field an indication which describes
   the semantics of the signaling situation or the characteristics of
   the rendering and allows the recipient to decide how to render the
   received information to the user.

   REQ-2: The mechanism will allow the identifier to be specified "by
   name" rather than "by value", to enable local policy decisions
   whether to use it or not.

   REQ-3: The mechanism will enable indications to represent a wide
   variety of signals, which have many largely-orthogonal
   characteristics.

   REQ-4: has been deleted.  To avoid confusion, the number will not be
   reused.

   REQ-5: The mechanism will enable the set of indications to be able to



Liess, et al.           Expires October 16, 2011                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs                  April 2011


   support extensibility by a wide variety of organizations that are not
   coordinated with each other.  Extensions will be able to:

   - add further values to any existing category

   - add further categories that are orthogonal to existing categories

   - semantically subdivide the meaning provided by any existing
   indication

   REQ-6: The mechanism will be flexible, so new identifiers can be
   defined in the future, when SIP-applications evolve.  E. g.  Alert-
   Info URNs could identify specific media by name, such as "Beethoven's
   Fifth", and the end device could render some small part of it as a
   ring tone.

   REQ-7: The mechanism will provide only an indication capability, not
   a negotiation capability.  The mechanism will not require an
   indication to depend on context provided by a previous indication in
   either direction.

   REQ-8: The mechanism will allow transmission in the Alert-Info header
   field of SIP INVITE requests and provisional 1xx responses excepting
   the 100 responses.

   REQ-9: The mechanism will be able to accommodate renderers that are
   customized with a limited or uncommon set of signals they can render
   and renderers that are provided with a set of signals that have
   uncommon semantics.  (The canonical example is a UA for the hearing-
   impaired, customized with an uncomon set of signals, video or text
   instead of audio.  By REQ-7, the renderer has no way of transmitting
   this fact to the specifier.)

   REQ-10: The mechanism will allow an indication to reliably carry all
   extensions if the specifier and the renderer have designs that are
   properly coordinated.

   REQ-11: The mechanism will allow a renderer to select a tone that
   approximates to that intended by the specifier if the renderer is
   unable to provide the precise tone indicated.

   REQ-12: The mechanism will support indications relating to services
   such as call waiting, forward, transfer-recall, auto-callback and
   hold-recall.

   REQ-13: The mechanism will allow rendering common PBX ring tone
   types.

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs                  April 2011


   REQ-14: The mechanism will allow rendering specific country ringback
   tones.

   REQ-15: The mechanism will allow rendering tones for emergency
   alerts.  (Use cases and values definition are not subject of this
   specification.)

   REQ-16: The mechanism will allow rendering using other means than
   tones, e.g. text or images.

   REQ-17: The mechanism will allow TDM gateways to map ring/ringback
   tones from legacy protocols to SIP at the edge of a network, e.g.
   national ring tones as defined in TIA/EIA-41-D and 3GPP2 A.S0014.
   (Use cases and values definition are not subject of this
   specification.)

   REQ-18: The mechanism will ensure that if an UA receives Alert-Info
   URNs or portions of an Alert-Info URN it does not understand, it can
   ignore them.

   REQ-19: The mechanism will allow storage of the actual encoding of
   the rendering locally rather than fetching it.

   REQ-20: The mechanism must provide a simple way to combine two
   indications to produce an indication that requests a combination of
   the intentions of the two indications, where any contradictions or
   conflicts between the two indications are resolved in favor of the
   intention of the first indication.


3.  Use Cases

   This section describes some use cases for which the Alert-Info URN
   mechanism is needed today.

3.1.  PBX Ring Tones

   This section defines some commonly encountered ring tones on PBX or
   business phones.  They are as follows:

3.1.1.  normal

   This tone indicates that the default or normal ring tone should be
   rendered.  This is essentially a no-operation Alert-Info URN and
   should be treated by the UA as if no Alert-Info URN is present.  This
   is most useful when Alert-Info header field parameters are being
   used.  For example, in [I-D.ietf-bliss-shared-appearances], an Alert-
   Info header field needs to be present containing the "appearance"

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs                  April 2011


   parameter, but no special ring tone needs to be specified.

3.1.2.  external

   This tone is used to indicate that the caller is external to the
   enterprise or PBX system.  This could be a call from the PSTN or from
   a SIP trunk.

3.1.3.  internal

   This tone is used to indicate that the caller is internal to the
   enterprise or PBX system.  The call could have been originated from
   another user on this PBX or on another PBX within the enterprise.

3.1.4.  priority

   A PBX tone needs to indicate that a priority level alert should be
   applied for the type of alerting specified (e.g. internal alerting).

3.1.5.  short

   In this case the alerting type specified (e.g. internal alerting)
   should be rendered shorter than normal.  In contact centers, this is
   sometimes referred to as "abbreviated ringing" or a "zip tone".

3.1.6.  delayed

   In this case the alerting type specified should be rendered after a
   short delay.  In some bridged line/shared line appearance
   implementations, this is used so that the bridged line does not ring
   at exactly the same time as the main line, but is delayed a few
   seconds.

3.2.  Service Tones

   These tones are used to indicate specific PBX and public network
   telephony services.

3.2.1.  call-waiting

   The Call Waiting Service [TS24.615] permits a callee to be notified
   of an incoming call while the callee is engaged in an active or held
   call.  Subsequently, the callee can either accept, reject, or ignore
   the incoming call.  There is an interest on the caller side to be
   informed about the call waiting situation on the callee side.  Having
   this information the caller can decide whether to continue waiting
   for callee to pickup or better to call some time later when it is
   estimated that the callee could have finished the ongoing



Liess, et al.           Expires October 16, 2011                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs                  April 2011


   conversation.  To provide this information, the callee's UAS ( or
   proxy) aware of the call waiting condition can add the call-waiting
   indication to the Alert-Info header field in the 180 Ringing
   response.  As call-waiting information may be subject to the callee's
   privacy concerns, the exposure of this information shall be done only
   if explicitly required by the user.

3.2.2.  forward

   This feature is used in a 180 Ringing response when a call forwarding
   feature has been initiated on an INVITE.  Many PBX system implement a
   forwarding "beep" followed by normal ringing to indicate this.  Note
   that a 181 response can be used in place of this URN.

3.2.3.  transfer-recall

   This feature is used when a blind transfer [RFC5589] has been
   performed by a server on behalf of the transferor and fails.  Instead
   of failing the call, the server calls back the transferor, giving
   them another chance to transfer or otherwise deal with the call.
   This service tone is used to distinguish this INVITE from any other
   normal incoming call.

3.2.4.  auto-callback

   This feature is used when a user has utilized a server to implement
   an automatic callback service.  When the user is available, the
   server calls back the user and utilizes this service tone to
   distinguish this from any other normal incoming call.

3.2.5.  hold-recall

   This feature is used when a server implements a call hold timer on
   behalf of an endpoint.  After a certain period of time of being on
   hold, the user who placed the call on hold is alerted to either
   retrieve the call or otherwise dispose of the call.  This service
   tone is used to distinguish this case from any other normal incoming
   call.

3.3.  Country-specific ringback tone indications for the public
      telephone network

   In the PSTN, different tones are used in different countries.  End
   users are accustomed to hear the callee's country ringback tone and
   would like to have this feature for SIP.

4.  Namespace Registration Template

   This section describes the registration template for the 'alert' URN
   namespace identifier (NID) according to the [RFC2141] and [RFC3406]

   Namespace ID:  alert

   Registration Information:

      Registration version:  1

      Registration date:  TBD

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

      Registering organization:  IETF

      Designated contact:  Laura Liess

      Designated contact email:  l.liess@telekom.de

   Declaration of syntactic structure:

      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) for the "alert" URNs is called
      alert-identifier and has a hierarchical structure.  The left-most
      label is called "alert-category" and is separated from the right-
      side of the alert-identifier, the alert-indication, by a colon.
      The general form is urn:alert:{alert-category}:{alert-indication}.

      In this specification, following alert-categories identifiers are
      described: "service" , "priority" , "source" , "duration", "delay"
      and "locale".  The alert-category set can be extended in the
      future.

      The categories are orthogonal.  Any Alert-Info URN defined in this
      specification is syntactically valid for ring and ringback tones
      and can be used in INVITE requests or in provisional 1xx responses
      excepting the 100 response.

      The alert-indications are hierarchical identifiers, consisting of
      one label or a sequence of labels separated by periods.  The set
      of allowable characters is the same as that for domain names
      [RFC1123].  Labels are case-insensitive, but MUST be specified in
      all lower-case.

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs                  April 2011






      The ABNF [RFC5234] for the Alert -Info URNs is shown below:



        alert-URN       = "URN:alert:" alert-identifier
        alert-identifier= alert-category ":" alert-indication
        alert-category  = name
        alert-indication= name *("." name)
        name = let-dig [ *let-dig-hyp let-dig ]
        let-dig-hyp     = let-dig / "-"
        let-dig         = ALPHA / DIGIT
        ALPHA           = %x41-5A / %x61-7A   ; A-Z / a-z
        DIGIT           = %x30-39 ; 0-9


   Relevant ancillary documentation:  None

   Community considerations:  The alert URN is believed to be relevant
      to a large cross-section of Internet users, including both
      technical and non-technical users, on a variety of devices and
      with a variety of perception capabilities.  The 'alert' URN will
      allow Internet users to receive more information and enable them
      to better make decisions about accepting an offered call, or get
      better feedback on the progress of a call they have made.  User
      interfaces for the perception impaired users can better render the
      ringback tone indication based on the Alert-Info URN.  The
      assignment of identifiers is described in Section 11.  The Alert-
      Info URN does not prescribe a particular resolution mechanism, but
      it is assumed that a number of different entities could operate
      and offer such mechanisms.

   Namespace considerations:  There do not appear to be other URN
      namespaces that serve the same need of uniquely identifying
      'alert' communication and information services.

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:  An Alert-Info URN identifies a
      logical service or tone, specified in the alert-indication
      registration (see Section 11).  Resolution of the registered URN
      will return a particular instance of the alert identifier.  Alert
      identifier URNs MUST be unique for each unique indication; this is
      guaranteed through the registration of each alert indication
      within this namespace, described in Section 11.

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs                  April 2011


   Identifier persistence considerations:  The Alert-Info URN for the
      same indication is expected to be persistent, as long as it is
      registered with IANA.

   Process of identifier assignment:  The process of identifier
      assignment is described in Section 11.

   Process for identifier resolution:  'Alert-Info URNs are statically
      resolved according to the IANA registry.

   Rules for lexical equivalence:  Alert-Info URNs are compared
      according to case-insensitive string equality.

   Conformance with URN syntax:  The BNF in the 'Declaration of
      syntactic structure' above constrains the syntax for this URN
      scheme.

   Validation mechanism:  Validation determines whether a given string
      is currently a validly-assigned URN [RFC3406].  Static validation
      is performed based on the currently registered Alert-Info URNs at
      IANA.

   Scope:  The scope for this URN is public and global.


5.  Alert-Info URN Values Definitions

5.1.  Alert-category Values Definitions

   Following alert-category values are defined in this document:

   - service

   - source

   - priority

   - duration

   - delay

   - locale

5.2.  Alert-indication Values Definitions

   This section describes the Alert-Info URN indication values for the
   alert-categories defined in this document.

Internet-Draft               Alert-Info URNs                  April 2011


   For each alert-category, a default indication is defined, which is
   essentially a no-operation Alert-Info URN and should be treated by
   the UA as if no Alert-Info URN for the respective category is
   present.  Alert-Info URN default indications are most useful when
   Alert-Info header field parameters are being used.  For example, in
   [I-D.ietf-bliss-shared-appearances], an Alert-Info header field needs
   to be present containing the "appearance" parameter, but no special
   ringtone need be specified.

5.2.1.  Alert-Info URN Indication Values for the alert-category
        'service'

   - normal (default)

   - call-waiting

   - forward

   - recall.callback

   - recall.hold

   - recall.transfer

   - private.<private-name>

   Examples: urn:alert:service:call-waiting or
   urn:alert:service:recall.transfer.

5.2.2.  Alert-Info URN Indication Values for the alert-category 'source'

   - unclassified (default)

   - internal

   - external

   - friend

   - family

   - private.<private-name>

   Examples: urn:alert:source:external.

5.2.3.  Alert-Info URN Indication Values for the alert-category
        'priority'

   - normal (default)

   - low

   - high

   - private.<private-name>

   Examples: urn:alert:priority:high.

   - normal (default)

   - short

   - long

   - private.<private-name>

   Examples: urn:alert:duration:short.

5.2.5.  Alert-Info URN Indication Values for the alert-category 'delay'

   - none (default)

   - yes

   - private.<private-name>

   Examples: urn:alert:delay:yes .

5.2.6.  Alert-Info URN Indication Values for the alert-category 'locale'

   - default (default)

   - country.<ISO 3166-1 country code>

   - private.<private-name>

   The ISO 3166-1 country code [ISO 3166-1] is used to inform the UA on
   the other side of the call that a country-specific rendering should
   be used.  For example, to indicate ringback tones from South Africa,
   the following URN would be used: <urn:alert:locale:country.za>.

6.  Extensibility Rules

6.1.  General Extensibility Rules

   TBD

6.2.  Extensions Rules for Independent Organizations

   The "private.<private-name>" syntax is for extensions specific to
   independent organizations.  The "<private-name>" is used in the form
   of a "reverse FQDN" such as is used for Java package names.  This
   gives a way of assigning unique names without the need for a new
   registry.  The namespace for each alert category is independent.
   Those assigning new names must ensure they are in a position to
   assign names uniquely for the FQDN they choose.  For example, a
   private company might want to define:
   urn:alert:source:private.com.example.customer

   Adding new categories and adding alert-indication values other than
   via the "private" mechanism is standards action.


7.  Combinations of URNs

   This chapter only describes combination rules for the case when all
   the Alert-Info header fields only contain Alert-Info URNs.
   Combinations of URNs and URIs in the Alert-Info header fields of the
   same SIP-message are not defined in this specification.

   In many cases, more than one URNs will be needed to fully define a
   particular tone.  This is done by including multiple Alert-Info URNs,
   in one or more Alert-Info header fields in a request or a response.
   For example, an internal, priority call could be indicated by Alert-
   Info: <urn:alert:source:internal>, <urn:alert:priority:high>.  A
   priority call waiting tone could be indicated by Alert-Info:
   <urn:alert:service:call-waiting>, <urn:alert:priority:high>.

   The categories are orthogonal.  Any Alert-Info URN defined in this
   specification is syntactically valid for ring and for ringback tones
   and can be used in an INVITE or in provisional 1xx responses
   excepting the 100 response.  There MUST be at most one instance of
   each alert-category in the Alert-Info header field(s) of a request or
   response.  In principle any combination of Alert-Info URNs with
   different "alert-category" is valid and can be used for either ring
   or ringback tones, though some combinations may not make sense.

   The receiving UA should make the decision about what to render to the
   user and what device it is rendered on depending on the value of the

   Alert-Info header field(s) content and of the kind of the received
   message (INVITE or provisional response).  Typically, the same UA
   will do the rendering of one or more particular Alert-Info header
   field(s) content received in an INVITE differently from the rendering
   of the same Alert-Info header field(s) content received in a
   provisional response.

   The exact way in which the various categories are combined for
   rendering is left as an implementation issue.  The implementation is
   free to ignore any or all parts of the received Alert-Info URNs.


8.  Priority Rules within Combinations of URNs

   TBD


9.  User Agent Behaviour

   Upon receiving a SIP INVITE request or a SIP provisional response
   with an Alert-Info header field that contains a single or multiple
   Alert-Info URNs, the User Agent (UA) attempts to match the received
   Alert-Info URNs with the known indications or indication
   combinations.  The User Agent (UA) ignores the Alert-Info URNs for
   which no match is found and proceeds with the normal operation.  If
   one or multiple URNs match(es) a known indication or a known
   indication combination, the User Agent (UA) renders the indication or
   the indication combination to the user accordingly.  The User Agent
   (UA) is responsible for the non disturbing rendering if multiple
   indications and network resources are to be rendered simultaneously.


10.  Proxy Behaviour

   A SIP proxy MAY add a URN or multiple URNs to the Alert-Info header
   field in a SIP request or a provisional 1xx response excepting 100
   response when it needs to provide additional information about the
   call or about the provided service.  A SIP Proxy SHOULD NOT add a
   mixture of Alert-Info URNs and URIs to the Alert-Info header field
   that may cause disturbing rendering interference at the recipient's
   User Agent (UA).

   Following example shows both the network audio resource referenced by
   the HTTP URI and the URN indication for the call-waiting service
   transported by the Alert-Info header field in a 180 Ringing
   provisional response.

11.  IANA Considerations

   This section registers a new URN namespace identifier (NID) in
   accordance with RFC 3406 with the registration template provided in
   Section 4 .

11.1.  New alert identifiers

   Alert URN identifiers are identified by labels managed by IANA,
   according to the processes outlined in [RFC5226] in a new registry
   called "Alert URN Labels".  Thus, creating a new Alert-Info URN
   identifier requires IANA action.  The policy for adding a new alert
   category is 'Standards Action'.  (This document defines the alert
   categories 'service', 'source', 'priority', 'duration', 'delay' and
   'locale'. ) The policy for assigning labels to alert-indications and
   the rules to combine them may differ for each alert-category and MUST
   be defined by the document describing the corresponding alert
   category.  The entries in the registration table have the following
   format:


      alert-category/      Reference    Description
      alert-identifier
      ---------------------------------------------------------------
      foo                  RFCxyz       Description of the 'foo'
                                        alert-category
      foo:bar              RFCabc       Description of the 'foo:bar'
                                        alert-identifier


   Each alert-category or alert-indication label MUST NOT exceed 27
   characters.

11.2.  Initial IANA Registration

11.2.1.   The "service" alert-category and alert-identifiers

   The following table contains the initial IANA registration for the
   "service" alert-category and alert-identifiers.  The value of this
   indicator is set to a value different from "normal" if the caller or
   callee is informed that a specific telephony service which has been
   initiated.

12.  Internationalization Considerations

   The alert-identifier labels are protocol elements [RFC3536] and are
   not normally seen by users.  Thus, the character set for these
   elements is restricted, as described in Section 11.


13.  Security Considerations

   As an identifier, the alert URN does not appear to raise any
   particular security issues.  The indications described by the 'alert'
   URN are meant to be well-known, so privacy considerations do not
   apply to the URN.

   Provision of the specific indications from callee to caller may raise
   privacy issues.  Such provision SHALL always be explicitly authorised
