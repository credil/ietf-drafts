Internet-Draft       DNS Extensions to Support IPv4 and IPv6      July 2009


Abstract

In the DNS architecture, two kinds of record types for maintaining
host's IP addresses are supported: one is A type which records IPv4
and AAAA for IPv6 addresses. This document defines a new TYPE, which
is mainly used in queries in order to get both IPv4 and IPv6
addresses. The main advantage is to avoid sending several requests
in order to resolve the location of a given resource. A single
request may be sufficient. The proposed solution does not require
the definition of any new record type.

1. Introduction

1.1 Current DNS operation

 There are mainly two resource record types to store IP addresses in
 the DNS system. One is A resource record, the other is AAAA
 resource record. An A resource record is defined to store an IPv4
 address, an AAAA is defined to store an IPv6 address.

1.2 Problem for current IPv6 DNS operation

 Due to large-scale applicable for IPv4, it will take a long time to
 fully transit from IPv4 to IPv6. During the transition period, IPv4
 network and IPv6 network will coexist.In most cases, the host will
 not know whether the address of the other side is IPv4 or IPv6.
 According to current practices, the host will send an AAAA query
 first. If there no IPv6 address has been retrieved, then an A query
 will be issued.

 The above mechanism has following disadvantages.
 1- It takes longer time to compare with only A or AAAA query which is
 needed.
 2- Both A and AAAA queries will waste bandwidth, especially the air
 interface bandwidth.
 3- More process resources in host and DNS server are needed.

 In order to solve the above problems, a new kind of query type is
 proposed.

2. New query type definition

 A new query type mainly used in queries is defined to get all
 available addresses (including IPv4 and IPv6). It is not intended
 to create new resource record.

2.1 v4v6 query type

 The v4v6 query type is specific to the Internet class.

2.2 v4v6 data format

 No new data format is defined. In fact, it is unnecessary to create
 new data format.

2.3 v4v6 query

Internet-Draft       DNS Extensions to Support IPv4 and IPv6       July 2009



 A v4v6 query for a specified domain name in the Internet class
 returns all associated A and AAAA resource records in the answer
 section of a response.

2.4 Textual format of v4v6 query type

 There is no new textual format for v4v6 query type.

3. Modifications to existing query types

 All existing query types that perform type A and AAAA processing
 must be updated to perform type A, type AAAA and v4v6 processing.
 These definitions mean that a name server must add relevant IPv4
 addresses and relevant IPv6 addresses available locally to the
 response when processing v4v6 queries.

4. Security Considerations

 Any information obtained from the DNS must be regarded as unsafe
 unless there are   some  new security mechanism. The definition of
 the v4v6 query type does not change the model for use of these
 techniques.

 So, this specification is not believed to cause any new security
 problem. Dedicated means to secure DNS communication should be
 encouraged.

5. IANA Considerations

There are no IANA assignment to be performed.
