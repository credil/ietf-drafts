Internet-Draft   IANA Registration for Enumservice 'iax'   February 2011


1.  Introduction

   The E.164 to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) [RFC3986] Dynamic
   Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Application (ENUM)
   [I-D.ietf-enum-3761bis] transforms E.164 [E164] numbers into Uniform
   Resource Identifiers (URIs) using the Domain Name System (DNS)
   [RFC1035].

   IAX (Inter-Asterisk eXchange) [RFC5456] is an "all in one" protocol
   for handling multimedia in IP networks.  It combines both control and
   media services in the same protocol.

   This document registers an Enumservice for the IAX [RFC5456] protocol
   according to the guidelines given in
   draft-ietf-enum-enumservices-guide
   [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide].


2.  IANA Registration

            <paragraph>
              The 'iax' Enumservice is used to map E.164 numbers to
              IAX URIs. Such URIs identify resources capable of being
              contacted to provide a communication session using the
              IAX protocol <xref target="RFC5456"/>.

              A client selecting this NAPTR needs to be able to support

          </functionalspec>
          <security>
            There are no specific security issues with this Enumservice.

3.  Examples

   The following examples are just for illustrative purposes and will in
   no way limit the usage of the 'iax' Enumservice to other usage
   scenarios.

Internet-Draft   IANA Registration for Enumservice 'iax'   February 2011


3.1.  Simple IAX URI

   The following NAPTR resource record is an example of the 'iax'
   Enumservice.

     $ORIGIN 8.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa.

     @     IN NAPTR ( 10 100 "u" "E2U+iax"
                  "!^.*$!iax:example.com/alice!" .   )

   This contact information indicates that the party addressed by the
   E.164 number +442079460148 can be contacted using the IAX protocol to
   domain 'example.com'.  The called party, service, or program on that
   domain is identified by 'alice'.

3.2.  IAX URI with a context

   The following is an example of the 'iax' Enumservice using an IPv6
   destination address and a destination 'context'.

   $ORIGIN 9.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa.

   @     IN NAPTR ( 10 100 "u" "E2U+iax"
                  "!^.*$!iax:[2001:db8::1]:4569/alice?friends!"  . )

   This NAPTR resource record indicates that +442079460149 may be
   contacted by using the IAX protocol at IPv6 address 2001:db8::1, port
   4569 with the called party 'alice' in the context (or user partition)
   'friends'.  For further usage of IAX URIs see Section 2 of [RFC5456].


4.  Security Considerations

   The 'iax' Enumservice does not introduce any new security issues
   beyond any already present in the ENUM, DNS and IAX protocols except
   that this Enumservice provides for disclosure of information that may
   facilitate an attack or a violation of user privacy in some way.  The
   primary result of these exploits is unwanted communications.  These
   issues are discussed in further detail in [RFC3833].

   The use of DNSSEC [RFC4033] is recommended to improve operational
   security.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests registration of the 'iax' Enumservice
   according to the guidelines and specifications in

   draft-ietf-enum-enumservices-guide [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide]
   and the definitions in Section 2 in this document.


6.  DNS Considerations

   Misconfiguration or delays in zone changes can result in call loops,
   perhaps with different protocols or networks.  Implementations should
   take care to ensure such loops can be detected without interrupting
   other services including SIP-based, IAX-based, and DNS itself.

   thanks to Michael Haberler, Bernie Hoeneisen and Richard Stastny for
   their support and guidance in writing this document.


8.  Draft Changes

   [Note to RFC-Editor: This section is to be removed before publishing.
   XML source is available upon request.]

8.1.  Changes since draft-ietf-enum-iax-08

   * KD: Changed the wording of the functionalspec

8.2.  Changes since draft-ietf-enum-iax-07

   * KD: Changed DNSSEC reference from RFC4035 to RFC4033, which gives
   an overview about DNSSEC

   * KD: in first example renamed "chas" to "alice" as it is IMO a more
   common and meaningful used term in examples

   * KD: Removed the example with priorities (this RFC is about the
   Enumservice registration and not about ENUM itself).  Remove the
   example with the context as the IPv6 example also uses a context.
   Changed description and title of remaining examples.

   * KD: Added introducery text to Examples section

   * KD: DNS considerations: removed reference to SIP ENUM RFC as the
   SIP ENUM RFC does not have a DNS Consideration section.

   * KD: ordered names in acknowledge section alphabetical

Internet-Draft   IANA Registration for Enumservice 'iax'   February 2011


   * KD: removed RFC3762 and RFC3764 from references, as they are not
   referenced in the text

8.3.  Changes since draft-ietf-enum-iax-06

   * KD: Changed title from "IANA Registration for IAX Enumservice" to
   "IANA Registration for Enumservice 'iax'" as the service type is in
   small letters

   * KD: Changed introduction (ENUM maps to URIs, not domains) - used
   wording from Enumservices draft [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide].

   * KD: Changed introduction: shortened IAX description - this RFC is
   not about IAX but about the ENUM service.

   * KD: Changed introduction: shortend description (the service field
   actually does not describe the class of functionality, but is mostly
   a pointer to supported communication protocols)

   * KD: Use the same wording in abstract and introduction: The
   Enumservice is not IAX but iax, thus used different wording.

   * KD: Fixed double-spaces

   * KD: IANA Registration: changed functional description: fixed
   wording, use 'communication' instead of 'call origination'

   * KD: IANA Registration: remove reference to URI registry (no clean
   way to reference) and moved reference to [RFC5456] one paragraph up

   * KD: Todo: Fix references "thisRFC" in IANA Registration

   * KD: Registration with multiple priorities: write "SIP", "H323" for
   the tokens, instead of "sip", "h323" and add 'mailto' to the
   protocols

   * KD: Examples: replaced "This contact information indicates that the
   domain 9.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa. may be contacted" with
   "This contact information indicates that +442079460149 may be
   contacted" as a domain is not contacted (although the previous text
   was from the ENUM RFC)

   * KD: Examples: Write IPv6 address in text without [] as the port is
   mentioned separately

   * KD: IANA Considerations: removed the sub-type as we do not register
   a sub-type

Internet-Draft   IANA Registration for Enumservice 'iax'   February 2011


   * KD: DNS Considerations: removed "Since IAX is typically deployed in
   a proxy configuration" as there is no "proxy" configuration in IAX

   * KD: DNS Considerations: removed reference to [RFC4759] as IMO it
   does not solve the loop problem on DNS changes and chached data (it
   does not even contain the word 'loop')

   * KD: Security Considerations: removed reference to RFC 4035
   regarding "unwanted communication" as DNSSEC is here not relevant.

   * KD: as suggested by Bernie: fixed references to RFC3761bis and
   draft-ietf-enum-enumservices-guide

   * KD: as suggested by Bernie: verified that all example numbers are
   UK drama numbers (http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/telecoms/
   numbering/guidance-tele-no/numbers-for-drama) and 2001:db8::1 is a
   "documentation" IPv6 address

   * KD: as suggested by Bernie: replaced "Editor" with "RFC-Editor"

   * KD: Acknowledgments: added Bernie

8.4.  Changes since draft-ietf-enum-iax-05

   * Changed to be compatible with [I-D.ietf-enum-enumservices-guide].

   * Added DNS Considerations section.

   * Per Dan Harkin's review, improved language in security
   considerations section and fixed typo.

   * Per Peter Koch's review, change DNS continuation character from \
   to ( ) form.

8.5.  Changes since draft-ietf-enum-iax-04


   * Removed the 'iax2' subtype per AD request.

   * Change from standards track to informational track.

   * Added citation to second paragraph.

8.6.  Changes since draft-ietf-enum-iax-03

   * Removed version number '2' from scheme name.

   * IDNITS: removed terminology section.

Internet-Draft   IANA Registration for Enumservice 'iax'   February 2011


   * Various rewordings per Alex Mayrhofer and idnits review.

   * Added E2U+email:mailto example to match text,

8.7.  Changes since draft-ietf-enum-iax-02

   * Clarifications suggested by Peter Koch.
