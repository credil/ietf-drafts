Internet-Draft          Reset Characterization             January 2010

1. Introduction

   An operational forwarding device may need to be re-configured or re-
   started for a variety of reasons, an event that we call a "reset" in
   this draft. Since there may be an interruption in the forwarding
   operation during a reset, it is useful to know how long a device
   takes to begin forwarding packets again.

   However, the answer to this question is no longer simple and
   straight-forward as the modern forwarding devices employ many
   hardware advancements (distributed forwarding etc.) and software
   advancements (graceful restart etc.) that influence the recovery
   time after the reset.

   Additionally, there are other factors that influence the recovery
   time after the reset:

     1. Type of reset - Hardware (line-card crash etc.) vs. Software
        (protocol reset, process crash etc.) or even complete power
        failures

     2. Manual vs. Automatic reset

     3. Local vs. Remote reset

     4. Scale - Number of line cards present vs. in-use

     5. Scale - Number of physical and logical interfaces

     6. Scale - Number of routing protocol instances

   This document specifies a methodology for characterizing reset
   during benchmarking of forwarding devices, and provides clarity and
   consistency in reset procedures beyond what's specified in
   [RFC2544]. These procedures may be used by other benchmarking
   documents such as [RFC2544], [RFC5180], [RFC5695], etc.

   This document updates Section 26.6 of [RFC2544].

1.1. Scope

   This document focuses on only the reset criterion of benchmarking,
   and presumes that it would be beneficial to [RFC2544], [RFC5180],
   [RFC5695], and other BMWG benchmarking efforts.

2. Key Words to Reflect Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].  RFC 2119 defines the use of these key words to help make
   the intent of standards track documents as clear as possible.  While
   this document uses these keywords, this document is not a standards
   track document.



3. Reset Test

   This section contains the description of the tests that are related
   to the characterization of DUT's (Device Under Test) / SUT's (System
   Under Test) speed to recover from a reset. There are three types of
   reset considered in this document:

     1. Hardware resets

     2. Software resets

     3. Power interruption

   Section 3.1 describes various hardware resets, whereas Section 3.2
   describes various software resets. Additionally, Section 3.3
   describes power interruption tests. These sections define and
   characterize these resets.

   Additionally, since device specific implementations may vary for
   hardware and software type resets, it is desirable to classify each
   test case as "mandatory" or "optional".



3.1. Hardware Reset

   A test designed to characterize the time it takes a DUT to recover
   from the hardware reset.

   A "hardware reset" generally involves the re-initialization of one
   or more physical components in the DUT, but not the entire DUT.

   A hardware reset is executed by the operator for example by physical
   removal of a physical component, or triggered from the command line
   interface.

Internet-Draft          Reset Characterization             January 2010

   For routers that do not contain separate Routing Processor and Line
   Card modules, the hardware reset tests are not performed and
   instead, the power interruption tests are mandatory (see Section
   3.3).

3.1.1. Routing Processor (RP) / Routing Engine reset

   The Routing Processor (RP) is the DUT module that is primarily
   concerned with Control Plane functions.

3.1.1.1. RP Failure for single RP device (mandatory)

   Objective

     To characterize the speed at which a DUT recovers from a Route
     processor hardware reset in a single RP environment.

   Procedure:

     Before beginning, the RP must be at a permanent state to which it
     will return to after the reset. To ensure this, operational tasks
     need to be completed: depending on the specific implementation
     these tasks may include: save the current DUT configuration,
     specify boot parameters, or perform additional Operating System or
     Hardware related task.

     First determine the throughput for the DUT for the minimum frame
     size on the media used in the testing. Traffic needs to be flowing
     at this stage and has to have been up running for at least 15
     seconds before any test activities are performed.

     The actual Route Processor (RP) hardware reset is performed at
     this point. This entails for example physically removing the RP to
     later re-insert it, or triggering a hardware reset by other means
     (e.g., command line interface, physical switch, etc).

     The characterization is taken by measuring the packet loss and
     recovery time from the moment the RP is re-initialized or
     reinserted.

   Reporting format

     The reset results are reported in a simple statement including the
     packet loss and recovery times.

     For each test case, it is RECOMMENDED that the following
     parameters be reported in these units:

Internet-Draft          Reset Characterization             January 2010

           Parameter                Units or Examples

           Throughput               Packets per second and

                                    bits per second

           Loss                     Packets

           Time                     Seconds, with sufficient resolution

                                    to convey meaningful info

           Frame Size               Octets

           Port Media               GigE (Gigabit Ethernet), POS, etc.

           Port Speed               1 Gbps, 100 Mbps, etc.

     The reporting of results MUST regard repeatability considerations
     from Section 4 of [RFC2544]. It is RECOMMENDED to perform multiple
     trials and report average results.



3.1.1.2. RP Failure for multiple RP device (optional)

   Objective

     To characterize the speed at which a "secondary" Route Processor
     (sometimes referred to as "backup" RP) of a DUT becomes active
     after a "primary" (or "active") Route Processor hardware reset.
     This process is often referred to as RP switchover. The
     characterization in this test should be done for the default DUT
     behavior as well as a DUT's non-default configuration that
     minimizes packet loss.

   Procedure

     This test characterizes "RP Switchover". Many implementations
     allow for optimized switchover capabilities that minimize the
     downtime during the actual switchover. This test consists of two
     sub-cases from a switchover characteristics standpoint: First, a
     default behavior (with no switchover-specific configurations); and
     second, a non-default behavior with switchover configuration to
     minimize packet loss. Therefore, the procedures hereby described
     are executed twice, and reported separately.

Internet-Draft          Reset Characterization             January 2010

     Before beginning, the multiple RPs must be at a permanent state
     such that the secondary will be activated to the same state as the
     active is. To ensure this, operational tasks need to be completed:
     depending on the specific implementation these tasks may include:
     save the current DUT configuration, specify boot parameters, or
     perform additional Operating System or Hardware related task.

     First determine the throughput for the DUT for the minimum frame
     size on the media used in the testing. Traffic needs to be flowing
     at this stage and has to have been up running for at least 15
     seconds before any test activities are performed.

     The actual primary Route Processor (RP) hardware reset is
     performed at this point. This entails for example physically
     removing the RP, or triggering a hardware reset by other means
     (e.g., command line interface, physical switch, etc). Is up to the
     Operator to decide if the active RP needs to be re-inserted after
     a grace period or not.

     The characterization is taken by measuring the complete packet
     loss and recovery time from the moment the active RP is hardware-
     reset.

   Reporting format

     The reset results are reported twice, one for the default
     switchover behavior and the other for the non-default one. For
     each, the report consists of a simple statement including the
     packet loss and recovery times, as well as any specific redundancy
     scheme in place.

     For each test case, it is RECOMMENDED that the following
     parameters be reported in these units:

           Parameter                Units or Examples

           Throughput               Packets per second and

                                    bits per second

           Loss                     Packets

           Time                     Seconds, with sufficient resolution

                                    to convey meaningful info

     trials and report average results.





3.1.2. Line Card (LC) Removal and Insertion (mandatory)

   The Line Card (LC) is the DUT component that is responsible with
   packet forwarding.

   Objective

     To characterize the speed at which a DUT recovers from a Line Card
     removal and insertion event.

   Procedure

     For this test, the Line Card that is being hardware-reset MUST be
     on the forwarding path and all destinations MUST be directly
     connected.

     At this stage operational tasks need to be completed: depending on
     the specific implementation these tasks may include: save the
     current DUT configuration, specify boot parameters, or perform
     additional Operating System or Hardware related task.

     First determine the throughput for the DUT for the minimum frame
     size on the media used in the testing. Traffic needs to be flowing
     at this stage and has to have been up running for at least 15
     seconds before any test activities are performed.

     The actual Line Card (LC) hardware reset is performed at this
     point. This entails for example physically removing the LC to
     later re-insert it, or triggering a hardware reset by other means
     (e.g., command line interface, physical switch, etc).

     The characterization is taken by measuring the packet loss and
     recovery time from the moment the LC is reinitialized or
     reinserted.

   Reporting Format

     The reset results are reported in a simple statement including the
     packet loss and recovery times.

     For each test case, it is RECOMMENDED that the following
     parameters be reported in these units:

           Parameter                Units or Examples

           Throughput               Packets per second and

                                    bits per second

           Loss                     Packets

           Time                     Seconds, with sufficient resolution

     The reporting of results MUST regard repeatability considerations
     from Section 4 of [RFC2544]. It is RECOMMENDED to perform multiple
     trials and report average results.



3.2. Software Reset

   To characterize the speed at which a DUT recovers from the software
   reset.

   In contrast to a "hardware reset", a "software reset" involves only
   the re-initialization of the execution, data structures, and partial
   state within the software running on the DUT.

   A software reset is initiated for example from the Command Line
   Interface (CLI).

3.2.1. Operating System (OS) reset (mandatory)

Internet-Draft          Reset Characterization             January 2010

     To characterize the speed at which a DUT recovers from an
     Operating System (OS) software reset.

   Procedure

     At this stage operational tasks need to be completed, depending on
     the specific implementation these tasks may include: save the
     current DUT configuration, specify software boot parameters, or
     perform additional Operating System task.

     First determine the throughput for the DUT for the minimum frame
     size on the media used in the testing. Traffic needs to be flowing
     through the DUT and has to have been up running for at least 15
     seconds before any test activities are performed.

     At this point, an Operating System re-initialization is triggered
     in the DUT, by operational means such as use of the Command Line
     Interface (CLI) or other management interface.

     The characterization is taken by measuring the complete packet
     loss and recovery time from the moment the reset instruction was
     given until the Operating System finished the reload and re-
     initialization (inferred by the re-establishing of traffic).

   Reporting format

     The reset results are reported in a simple statement including the
     packet loss and recovery times.

     For each test case, it is RECOMMENDED that the following
     parameters be reported in these units:

           Parameter                Units or Examples

           Throughput               Packets per second and

                                    bits per second

           Loss                     Packets

           Time                     Seconds, with sufficient resolution

3.2.2. Process reset (optional)

   Objective

     To characterize the speed at which a DUT recovers from a software
     process reset.

     Such speed may depend upon the number and types of process running
     in the DUT and which ones are tested. Different implementations of
     forwarding devices include various common processes. A process
     reset should be performed only in the processes most relevant to
     the tester.

   Procedure

     At this stage operational tasks need to be completed, depending on
     the specific implementation these tasks may include: save the
     current DUT configuration, specify software parameters or
     environmental variables, or perform additional Operating System
     task.

     First determine the throughput for the DUT for the minimum frame
     size on the media used in the testing. Traffic needs to be flowing
     through the DUT and has to have been up running for at least 15
     seconds before any test activities are performed.

     For each process running in the DUT and considered for testing, a
     process reset is triggered in the DUT from a management interface
     by an operator (e.g., by means of the Command Line Interface
     (CLI), etc).

   Reporting format

     The reset results are reported in a simple statement including the
     packet loss and recovery times for each process running in the DUT
     and tested. Given the implementation nature of this test, details
     of the actual process tested should be included along with the
     statement.

     For each test case, it is RECOMMENDED that the following
     parameters be reported in these units:

           Parameter                Units or Examples

           Throughput               Packets per second and

                                    bits per second

           Loss                     Packets

           Time                     Seconds, with sufficient resolution

                                    to convey meaningful info

           Frame Size               Octets

           Port Media               GigE (Gigabit Ethernet), POS, etc.

           Port Speed               1 Gbps, 100 Mbps, etc.

     The reporting of results MUST regard repeatability considerations
     from Section 4 of [RFC2544]. It is RECOMMENDED to perform multiple
     trials and report average results.





3.3. Power interruption

   "Power interruption" refers to the complete loss of power on the
   DUT. It can be viewed as a special case of a hardware reset,
   triggered by the loss of the power supply to the DUT or its
   components, and is characterized by the re-initialization of all
   hardware and software in the DUT.



3.3.1. Power Interruption (mandatory)



   Objective

     To characterize the speed at which a DUT recovers from a complete
     loss of electric power or complete power interruption. This test

     simulates a complete power failure or outage, and should be
     indicative of the DUT/SUT's behavior during such event.

   Procedure:

     Before beginning, the entire DUT must be at a permanent state to
     which it will return to after the power interruption. To ensure
     this, operational tasks need to be completed: depending on the
     specific implementation these tasks may include: save the current
     DUT configuration, specify boot parameters, or perform additional
     Operating System or Hardware related task.

     First determine the throughput for the DUT for the minimum frame
     size on the media used in the testing. Traffic needs to be flowing
     at this stage and has to have been up running for at least 15
     seconds before any test activities are performed.

     The actual power (AC or DC) that feeds the corresponding DUT's
     power supplies is interrupted at this point. This entails for
     example physically removing the power supplies in the DUT to later
     re-insert them, or simply disconnecting or switching off their
     power feeds (AC or DC as applicable). The actual power
     interruption should last at least 15 seconds.

     The characterization is taken by measuring the packet loss and
     recovery time from the moment the power is restored or the power
     supplies reinserted in the DUT.

   Reporting format

     The reset results are reported in a simple statement including the
     packet loss and recovery times.

     For each test case, it is RECOMMENDED that the following
     parameters be reported in these units:

           Parameter                Units or Examples

           Throughput               Packets per second and

                                    bits per second

           Loss                     Packets

           Time                     Seconds, with sufficient resolution

                                    to convey meaningful info

4. Security Considerations

   Benchmarking activities, as described in this memo, are limited to
   technology characterization using controlled stimuli in a laboratory
   environment, with dedicated address space and the constraints
   specified in the sections above.

   The benchmarking network topology will be an independent test setup
   and MUST NOT be connected to devices that may forward the test
   traffic into a production network or misroute traffic to the test
   management network.

   Furthermore, benchmarking is performed on a "black-box" basis,
   relying solely on measurements observable external to the DUT/SUT.

   Special capabilities SHOULD NOT exist in the DUT/SUT specifically
   for benchmarking purposes.  Any implications for network security
   arising from the DUT/SUT SHOULD be identical in the lab and in
   production networks.

   There are no specific security considerations within the scope of
   this document.



5. IANA Considerations

   There is no IANA consideration for this document.
