Abstract

   RFC documents contain a number of fixed elements such as the title
   page header, standard boilerplates and copyright/IPR statements.
   This document describes them and introduces some updates to reflect
   current usage and requirements of RFC publication.  In particular,
   this updated structure is intended to communicate clearly the source
   of RFC creation and review.

Internet-Draft     RFC Streams, Headers, Boilerplates       January 2009


1.  Introduction

   Previously RFCs (e.g.  [RFC4844]) contained a number of elements that
   were there for historical, practical, and legal reasons.  They also
   contained boilerplate material to clearly indicate the status of the
   document and possibly contained "Notes" to indicate how the document
   interacts with IETF Standards-Track documents.

   As the RFC Series has evolved over the years, there has been
   increasing concern over appropriate labelling of the publications to
   make clear the status of each RFC and the status of the work it
   describes.  Chiefly, there is a requirement that RFCs published as
   part of the IETF's review process not be easily confused with RFCs
   that may have had a very different review and approval process.
   Various adjustments have been made over the years, including evolving
   text of "Notes" included in the published RFC.

   With the definition of the different RFC streams [RFC4844] it is
   appropriate to formalize the definition of the various pieces of
   standard RFC boilerplate and introduce some adjustments to ensure
   better clarity of expression of document status, aligned with the
   review and approval processes defined for each stream.

   This memo identifies and describes the common elements of RFC
   boilerplate structure, and provides a comprehensive approach to
   updating and using those elements to communicate, with clarity, RFC
   document and content status.  Most of the historical structure
   information is collected from [RFC2223].

   The changes introduced by this memo should be implemented as soon as
   practically possible after the document has been approved for
   publication.


2.  RFC Streams and Internet Standards

   Users of RFCs should be aware that while all Internet standards-
   related documents are published as RFCs, not all RFCs are Internet
   standards-related documents.

   The IETF is responsible for maintaining the Internet Standards
   Process, which includes the requirements for developing, reviewing
   and approving Standards Track and BCP RFCs.  These, and any other
   standards-related documents (Informational or Experimental) are
   reviewed by appropriate IETF bodies and published as part of the IETF
   Stream.

   Documents published in streams other than the IETF Stream are not



Daigle, et al.            Expires July 20, 2009                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft     RFC Streams, Headers, Boilerplates       January 2009


   reviewed by the IETF for such things as security, congestion control,
   or inappropriate interaction with deployed protocols.  They have also
   not been subject to approval by the Internet Engineering Steering
   Group (IESG), including an IETF-wide last call.  Therefore, the IETF
   disclaims, for any of the non-IETF Stream documents, any knowledge of
   the fitness of those RFCs for any purpose.

   Refer to [RFC2026], [I-D.housley-iesg-rfc3932bis], and [RFC4844] and
   their successors for current details of the IETF process and RFC
   streams.


3.  RFC Structural Elements

3.1.  The title page header

   An RFC title page header can be described as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
<document source>                                          <author name>
Request for Comments: <RFC number>                [<author affiliation>]
[<subseries ID> <subseries number>]    [more author info as appropriate]
[<RFC relation>:<RFC number[s]>]
Category: <category>
                                                           <month year>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   For example, a sample earlier RFC header is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Network Working Group                                          T. Dierks
Request for Comments: 4346                                   Independent
Obsoletes: 2246                                              E. Rescorla
Category: Standards Track                                     RTFM, Inc.
                                                             April 2006

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The right column contains author name and affiliation information as
   well as RFC publication date.  Conventions and restrictions for these
   elements are described in RFC style norms and some individual stream
   definitions.

   This section is primarily concerned with the information in the left
   column:





Daigle, et al.            Expires July 20, 2009                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft     RFC Streams, Headers, Boilerplates       January 2009


   <document source>  This describes the area where the work originates.
      Historically, all RFCs were labeled Network Working Group.
      "Network Working Group" refers to the original version of today's
      IETF when people from the original set of ARPANET sites and
      whomever else was interested -- the meetings were open -- got
      together to discuss, design and document proposed protocols
      [RFC0003].  Here, we obsolete the term "Network Working Group" in
      order to indicate the originating stream.

      The <document source> is the name of the RFC stream, as defined in
      [RFC4844] and its successors.  At the time of this publication,
      the streams, and therefore the possible entries are:

      *  Internet Engineering Task Force

      *  Internet Architecture Board

      *  Internet Research Task Force

      *  Independent

   Request for Comments: <RFC number>  This indicates the RFC number,
      assigned by the RFC Editor upon publication of the document.  This
      element is unchanged.

   <subseries ID> <subseries number>  Some document categories are also
      labeled as a subseries of RFCs.  These elements appear as
      appropriate for such categories, indicating the subseries and the
      documents number within that series.  Currently, there are
      subseries for BCPs [RFC2026], STDs[RFC1311], and FYIs [RFC1150].
      These subseries numbers may appear in several RFCs.  For example,
      when a new RFC obsoletes or updates an old one, the same subseries
      number is used.  Also, several RFCs may be assigned the same
      subseries number: a single STD, for example, may be composed of
      several RFCs, each of which will bear the same STD number.  This
      element is unchanged.

   [<RFC relation>:<RFC number[s]>]  Some relations between RFCs in the
      series are explicitly noted in the RFC header.  For example, a new
      RFC may update one or more earlier RFCs.  Currently two
      relationships are defined: "Updates", and "Obsoletes" [RFC2223].
      Variants like "Obsoleted by" are also used (e.g in [RFC5143]).
      Other types of relations may be defined elsewhere.

   Category: <category>  This indicates the initial RFC document
      category of the publication.  These are defined in [RFC2026].
      Currently, this is always one of: Standards Track, Best Current
      Practice, Experimental, Informational, or Historic.  This element

Internet-Draft     RFC Streams, Headers, Boilerplates       January 2009


      is unchanged.

3.2.  The Status of this Memo

   The "Status of This Memo" describes the category of the RFC,
   including the distribution statement.  This text is included
   irrespective of the source stream of the RFC.

   From now on, the "Status of This Memo" will start with a single
   sentence describing the status.  It will also include a statement
   describing the stream-specific review of the material (which is
   stream-dependent).  This is an important component of status, insofar
   as it clarifies the breadth and depth of review, and gives the reader
   an understanding of how to consider its content.

3.2.1.  Paragraph 1

   The first paragraph of the Status of this Memo section contains a
   single sentence, clearly standing out.  It depends on the category of
   the document.

   For 'Standards Track' documents:  This is an Internet Standards Track
      document.

   For 'Best Current Practices' documents:  This memo documents an
      Internet Best Current Practice

   For other categories  This document is not an Internet Standards
      Track specification; <it is published for other purposes>.

   For Informational, Experimental, Historic and future categories of
   RFCs, the RFC editor will maintain an appropriate text for <it is
   published for other purposes>.  Initial values are:

   Informational:   it is published for informational purposes."

   Historic:   it is published for historical record."

   Experimental:   it is published for examination, experimental
      implementation, and evaluation."

3.2.2.  Paragraph 2

   The second paragraph of the "Status of This Memo" will now include a
   paragraph describing the type of review and exposure the document has
   received.  This is defined on a per-stream basis, although there is a
   specific structure defined here to ensure there is clarity about
   review processes and document types.  From now on, these paragraphs



Daigle, et al.            Expires July 20, 2009                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     RFC Streams, Headers, Boilerplates       January 2009


   will be defined as part of RFC stream definitions.  Initial text, for
   current streams, is provided below.

   The paragraph may include some text that is specific to the initial
   document category, as follows: when a document is Experimental or
   Historic the second paragraph opens with:

   Experimental:  "This document defines an Experimental Protocol for
      the Internet community.  Discussion and suggestions for
      improvement are requested."

   Historic:  "This document defines a Historic Document for the
      Internet community.

   The text that follows is stream dependent -- these are initial values
   and may be updated by stream definition document updates.

   IETF Stream:  "This document is a product of the Internet Engineering
      Task Force (IETF). "

      If there has been an IETF consensus call per IETF process, an
      additional sentence should be added: "It represents a consensus of
      the IETF community.  It has received public review and has been
      approved for publication by the Internet Engineering Steering
      Group (IESG)."

   IAB Stream:  "This document is a product of the Internet Architecture
      Board (IAB), and represents information that the IAB has deemed
      valuable to provide for permanent record.

   IRTF Stream:  "This document is a product of the Internet Research
      Task Force (IRTF).  The IRTF publishes the results of Internet-
      related research and development activities.  These results might
      not be suitable for deployment.

      In addition a sentence indicating the consensus base within the
      IRTF may be added: "This RFC represents the consensus of the
      <insert_name> Research Group of the Internet Research Task Force
      (IRTF)." or alternatively "This RFC represents the individual
      opinion(s) of one or more members of the <insert_name> Research
      Group of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF)".

   Independent Stream:  "This is a contribution to the RFC Series,
      independently of any other RFC stream.  The RFC Editor has chosen
      to publish this document at its discretion and makes no statement
      about its value for implementation or deployment.

   For non-IETF stream documents a reference to Section 2 of this RFC is



Daigle, et al.            Expires July 20, 2009                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     RFC Streams, Headers, Boilerplates       January 2009


   added with the following sentence: "Documents approved for
   publication by the [stream approver -- currently, one of: "IAB",
   "IRSG", or "RFC Editor"] are not a candidate for any level of
   Internet Standard; see Section 2 of RFCXXXX."

   For IETF stream documents a similar reference is added: "Further
   information on [BCPs or Internet Standards] is available in Section 2
   of RFCXXXX." for BCP and Standard Track docments; "Not all documents
   approved by the IESG are candidate for any level of Internet
   Standards see Section 2 of RFCXXXX." for all other categories.

3.2.3.  Paragraph 3

   The boilerplate ends with a reference to where further relevant
   information can be found: "Please see the 'Updates to the RFC'
   section of this document for information on where to find the status
   of this document and the availability of errata for this memo." the
   exact wording is subject to change by the RFC Editor.

3.2.4.  Noteworthy

   Note that the texts in paragraph 1 and 2 of the boilerplate indicate
   the initial status of a document.  During their lifetime documents
   can change status to e.g.  Historic.  This cannot be reflected in the
   document itself and will need be reflected in the information refered
   to in Section 3.4.

3.3.  Additional Notes

   Exceptionally, a review and publication process may prescribe
   additional notes that will appear as labelled notes after the "Status
   of This Memo".

   While this has been a common feature of recent RFCs, it is the goal
   of this document to make the overall RFC structure adequately clear
   to remove the need for such notes, or at least make their usage truly
   exceptional.

3.4.  Other structural information in RFCs

   RFCs contain other structural informational elements.  The RFC Editor
   is responsible for the positioning and layout of these structural
   element.  Note also that new elements may be introduced or obsoleted
   using a process consistent with [RFC4844].  These additions may or
   may not require documentation in an RFC.

   Currently the following structural information is available or is
   being considered for inclusion in RFCs

   Copyright Notice  A copyright notice with a reference to BCP78
      [BCP78] and an Intellectual Property statement referring to BCP78
      and BCP79 [BCP79].  The content of these statements are defined by
      those BCPs.

   ISSN  The International Standard Serial Number [ISO3297]: ISSN 2070-
      1721.  The ISSN uniquely identifies the RFC series as title
      regardless of language or country in which it is published.  The
      ISSN itself has no significance other than the unique
      identification of a serial publication.

   Updates to the RFC  A reference identifying where more information
      about the document can be found.  This may include information
      whether the RFC has been updated or obsoleted, the RFC's
      originating stream, a listing of possible errata, and information
      on how to submit errata as described in
      [I-D.rfc-editor-errata-process].


4.  Security considerations

   This document tries to clarify the descriptions of the status of an
   RFC.  Misunderstanding the status of a memo could cause
   interoperability problems, hence security and stability problems.


5.  IANA considerations

   None.


6.  RFC Editor Considerations

   The RFC Editor is responsible for maintaining the consistency of the
   RFC series.  To that end the RFC Editor maintains a style manual
   [RFC-style].  In this memo we mention a few explicit structural
   elements that the RFC editor needs to maintain.  The conventions for
   the content and use of all current and future elements are to be
   documented in the style manual.

   Adding a reference to the stream in the header of RFCs is only one
   method for clarifying from which stream an RFC originated.  The RFC
   editor is encouraged to add such indication in e.g. indices and
   interfaces.

   editing this document and can be removed before publication]

   The documents has two sections, including this one that need to be
   removed before publication as an RFC.  This one and Appendix D.

   This memo introduces a number of modifications that will have to be
   implemented in various tools, such as the xml2rfc tool, the nit
   tracker and the rfc-erratum portal.

   The number "XXXX" is to be replaced with RFC number of this memo.

   References [RFC-style], [BCP78] and [BCP79] have been constructed.
   Please bring these in line with RFC Editorial conventions.

   In section Section 3.4: For the final publication, it should be
   warranted that the ISSN is *not* split by a line break, for clarity.

Appendix D.  Document Editing Details

   [To Be Removed before publication]

   $Id: headers-boilerplates.xml 58 2009-01-16 07:38:34Z olaf $

D.1.  version 00->01

   Fixed the header so it appropriately shows that the document updates
   RFC 4844, 2223.  And added a link to 3932-bis that should appear in
   tandem with this publication.

   Introduced the "Other structural information in RFCs" section and
   moved the ISSN number from the front matter to this section.  The
   "Other structural information in RFCs" intends to give very rough
   guidance providing the RFC editor with sufficient freedom to move
   pieces around and edit them to please the eye and mind.

   Modified the last sentence 3rd paragraph of the Status of this memo
   section for the IRTF Stream in accordance to a suggestion by Aaron
   Falk; Indicating that review happened by the IRSG and not indicating
   that review did not happen by the IESG.

   Introduced the square brackets around the <author affiliation> in the
   header.  To highlight this is an optional element.

   The definition of the "Clarifies" relation has been taken out.  There
   are arguments that introducing the relation needs a bit more thought
   and is better done by a separate document.

   Provided the RFC Editor with responsibility to maintain several text
   pieces.

   In Section 3.2 some modifications were applied to the text.

   The <description> contains the full name of the stream.

   RFC2223 and 4844 moved to the informative reference section.
   Although I am not sure if those are not normative.  Guidance!!!

D.2.  version 01->02

   Fixed some editorial nits and missing references.

   Clarified that the status and category are initial.

   Added boilerplate text for documents that are initially published as
   Historic.

   Added members of IAB, and removed those members from acknowledgements

   Added References to BCP78 and BCP79.  The exact formatting of those
   references may need to be done by the RFC editor.

   Added text to recognize occurrences of variations of "Obsolete" and
   "Update"

D.3.  version 02->03

   Stray language in the "IAB members at time of approval" section
   removed.

D.4.  version 03->04

   Addressed the minor nit from Brian Carpenter.

   Reference to style guide stet to styleguide.html

D.5.  version 04->05

   References updated to reflect BCP78 being updated

   Submitted under new boilerplate
