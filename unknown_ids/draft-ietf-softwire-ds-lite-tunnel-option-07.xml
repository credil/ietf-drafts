      <t>This document specifies a DHCPv6 option which is meant 
	to be used by a Dual-Stack Lite Basic Bridging Broadband (B4)
        element to discover the IPv6 address of its corresponding Address

    </section>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="I-D.softwire-ds-lite">Dual-Stack Lite</xref> is a
	solution to offer both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity to customers which
	are addressed only with an IPv6 prefix (no IPv4 address is assigned to
	the attachment device). One of its key components is an IPv4-over-IPv6
	tunnel, commonly referred to as a Softwire.  A DS-Lite &quot;Basic
	Bridging BroadBand&quot; (B4) device will not know if the network it
	is attached to offers Dual-Stack Lite service, and if it did would not
	know the remote endpoint of the tunnel to establish a softwire.</t>

      <t>To inform the B4 of the Address Family Transition Router's (AFTR)
	location, a <xref target="RFC1035">DNS</xref> hostname may be used.
	Once this information is conveyed, the presence of the configuration
	indicating the AFTR's location also informs a host to initiate
	Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite) service and become a Softwire Initiator.</t>

      <t>To provide the conveyance of the configuration information, a single
        <xref target="RFC3315">DHCPv6</xref> option is used, expressing the
        AFTR's Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) to the B4 element.</t>

      <t>The details of how the B4 establishes an IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire
	to the AFTR are out of scope for this document.</t>
    </section>

    <section title='The AFTR-Name DHCPv6 Option' anchor='option-name'>
      <t>The AFTR-Name option consists of option-code and option-len fields
	(as all DHCPv6 options have), and a variable length
        tunnel-endpoint-name field containing a fully qualified domain name
        that refers to the AFTR which the client MAY connect to.</t>

      <t>The AFTR-Name option MUST NOT appear in any other than the
        following DHCPv6 messages: Solicit, Advertise, Request, Renew, Rebind,
        Information-Request and Reply.</t>

      <t>The format of the AFTR-Name option is shown in the following
	figure:</t>

    |                                                               |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+

        OPTION_AFTR_NAME: (TBD)

              option-len: Length of the tunnel-endpoint-name field in
                          octets.

    tunnel-endpoint-name: A fully qualified domain name of the AFTR
                          tunnel endpoint.
        </artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>The tunnel-endpoint-name field is formatted as
        required in <xref target="RFC3315">DHCPv6</xref> Section 8
        (&quot;Representation and Use of Domain Names&quot;).  Briefly, the
        format described is using a single octet noting the length of one
        DNS label (limited to at most 63 octets), followed by the label
        contents.  This repeats until all labels in the FQDN are exhausted,
        including a terminating zero-length label.  Any updates to Section 8
	of <xref target="RFC3315">DHCPv6</xref> also apply to encoding of this
	field.  An example format for this option is shown in
	<xref target="fqdn-example"/>, which conveys the FQDN
	&quot;aftr.example.com.&quot;.</t>

      <figure align="center" anchor="fqdn-example"
       title="Example tunnel-endpoint-name.">
        <artwork>
    +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
    | 0x04 |   a  |   f  |   t  |   r  | 0x07 |   e  |   x  |   a  |
    +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
    |   m  |   p  |   l  |   e  | 0x03 |   c  |   o  |   m  | 0x00 |
    +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
        </artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>Note that in the specific case of the
        <xref target="fqdn-example">example tunnel-endpoint-name</xref>,
	the length of the tunnel-endpoint-name is 18 octets, and so an
	option-len field value of 18 would be used.</t>

      <t>The option is validated by confirming that the option-len is greater
	than 3, that the option data can be contained by the option length
	(that the option length does not run off the end of the packet), that
	individual label lengths do not exceed the option length, and
	that the tunnel-endpoint-name is of valid format as described in
	<xref target="RFC3315">DHCPv6 Section 8</xref>; there are no
	compression tags, there is at least one label of nonzero length.</t>

    <section title="DHCPv6 Server Behavior">
      <t>A DHCPv6 server MUST NOT send more than one AFTR-Name
        option.  It SHOULD NOT permit the configuration of multiple names
        within one AFTR-Name option.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC3315">RFC 3315 Section 17.2.2</xref>
        describes how a DHCPv6 client and server negotiate configuration
        values using the Option Request Option (OPTION_ORO).  As a convenience
        to the reader, we mention here that a server will not reply with a
        AFTR-Name option if the client has not explicitly enumerated it on
        its Option Request Option.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="DHCPv6 Client Behavior">
      <t>A client that supports the B4 functionality of DS-Lite (defined
        in <xref target="I-D.softwire-ds-lite"/>) and conforms to 
	this specification MUST include OPTION_AFTR_NAME on its OPTION_ORO.</t>

      <t>Because it requires DNS name to address resolution, the client MAY
        also wish to include the
        <xref target="RFC3646">OPTION_DNS_SERVERS</xref> option on its
        OPTION_ORO.</t>

      <t>If the client receives the AFTR-Name option, it MUST verify the
        option contents as described in <xref target="option-name"/>.</t>

      <t>If the client receives more than one AFTR-Name option, it
        MUST use only the first instance of that option.</t>

      <t>If the AFTR-Name option contains more than one FQDN,
        as distinguished by the presence of multiple root labels, the client
        MUST use only the first FQDN listed in configuration.</t>

      <t>The client performs standard DNS resolution using the provided FQDN
        to resolve a AAAA Resource Record, as defined in
        <xref target="RFC3596"/> and STD 13 <xref target="RFC1034"/>
        <xref target="RFC1035"/>.</t>

      <t>If any DNS response contains more than one IPv6 address, the client
        picks only one IPv6 address and uses it as a remote tunnel endpoint for
        the interface being configured in the current message exchange.
        The client MUST NOT establish more than one DS-Lite tunnel at the
        same time per interface.  For a redundancy and high availability
        discussion, see Section 7.2 &quot;High availability&quot; of
        <xref target="I-D.softwire-ds-lite"/>.</t>

      <t>Note that a client may have multiple network interfaces, and these
        interfaces may be configured differently; some may be connected to
        networks that call for DS-Lite, and some may be connected to networks
        that are using normal dual stack or other means.  The client should
        consider the above on an interface-by-interface basis.  For example,
        if the client is attached to multiple networks that provide the AFTR
        Name option, then the client MUST configure a tunnel for each interface
        separately as each DS-Lite tunnel provides IPv4 connectivity for each
        distinct interface.
      </t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document does not present any new security issues, but as with
	all DHCPv6-derived configuration state, it is completely possible that
	the configuration is being delivered by a third party (Man In The
	Middle).  As such, there is no basis to trust that the access the
	DS-Lite Softwire connection represents can be trusted, and it should
	not therefore bypass any security mechanisms such as IP firewalls.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC3315">RFC 3315</xref> discusses DHCPv6-related
	security issues.</t>

	related security issues.</t>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA is requested to allocate single DHCPv6 option code referencing
        this document, delineating OPTION_AFTR_NAME.</t>
