   Adding a Flexible GetSize RPC Variant to the AFS-3 Volume Service
                     draft-deason-afs3-getsizev2-02

Abstract

   This document describes an additional Rx remote procedure call that
   may be used to obtain the size of an AFS-3 volume dump from an AFS-3
   Volume Service.  While an RPC already exists for this purpose
   (AFSVolGetSize), this document proposes a more flexible mechanism
   that is able to more accurately determine the size of a volume dump
   in a greater number of cases.

Internet-Draft        AFS-3 AFSVol Flexible GetSize           March 2011


1.  Introduction

   AFS-3 provides a service (the "Volume Service") [AFS3-VVL] which
   allows administrators to examine and manage AFS-3 volumes via several
   Rx remote procedure calls (RPCs) in the AFSVol package.  One of these
   RPCs, AFSVolDump, can be used to obtain a dump of an AFS-3 volume
   that can be stored on disk, usually for backup or archival purposes.
   Another RPC, AFSVolDumpV2, was later added to allow the caller to
   make slight modifications to what data is contained in the dump by
   way of specifying certain flags in an additional argument.

   To allow computation of the size of volumes returned by the
   AFSVolDump RPC, an AFSVolGetSize RPC was provided.  However, no
   analogous RPC exists to determine what the size of a volume dump
   obtained via AFSVolDumpV2 would be if any flags were specified in the
   AFSVolDumpV2 call.  This document describes a new RPC,
   AFSVolGetSizeV2, to fill this gap, to allow computation of the sizes
   of volume dumps generated by AFSVolDumpV2.


2.  Conventions Used in this Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Error Codes

   The existing VOLSERBAD_ACCESS, VOLSERTRELE_ERROR, and ENOENT error
   codes are used by the new RPC defined within this document.  The
   meaning and value of these error codes can be found in [AFS3-VVL],
   with the exception of ENOENT's value.  ENOENT is defined to have the
   value 2.


4.  Extant RPC Interface

   The newly-defined RPC AFSVolGetSizeV2 has very similar behavior to
   the RPCs AFSVolDumpV2 and AFSVolGetSize.  While these RPCs already
   exist and are in use, there is no existing document describing their
   behavior in significant detail.  Their behavior is briefly described
   here, so the role of AFSVolGetSizeV2 may be better understood.

4.1.  AFSVolDumpV2

   The AFSVolDumpV2 RPC generates a canonical dump of the contents of a
   volume associated with a volume transaction.  It is identical to the

Internet-Draft        AFS-3 AFSVol Flexible GetSize           March 2011


   AFSVolDump RPC [AFS3-VVL], except for the addition of the flags
   parameter.

       AFSVolDumpV2(IN afs_int32 fromTrans, IN afs_int32 fromDate,
                    IN afs_int32 flags) split = 65538;

   Input arguments:

   fromTrans

      A transaction ID as returned by the RPC AFSVolTransCreate.

   fromDate

      If 0, the generated volume dump will be a "full dump", and will
      contain all data in the volume.  Otherise, this represents a
      calendar date, represented as the number of seconds since the Unix
      Epoch.  The generated dump will then only contain files that have
      been modified on or after the specified calendar date.

   flags

      Zero or more flags combined via a bitwise OR operation.  The
      available flags are described below in Section 4.3.

   As with AFSVolDump, the generated volume dump for AFSVolDumpV2
   appears in the Rx stream for the split call [AFS3-RX] if there are no
   errors.  The call is aborted with an error for all of the same
   conditions where AFSVolDump aborts with an error as described in
   [AFS3-VVL], with the appropriate error code.

4.2.  AFSVolGetSize

   The AFSVolGetSize RPC calculates what the size of a volume dump
   obtained from calling AFSVolDump [AFS3-VVL] would be.  This allows
   dump sizes to be calculated without needing to generate and transfer
   the entire volume dump.

       struct volintSize {
           afs_uint64 dump_size;
       };

       AFSVolGetSize(IN afs_int32 fromTrans, IN afs_int32 fromDate,
                     OUT struct volintSize *size) = 65537;

   Input arguments:

Internet-Draft        AFS-3 AFSVol Flexible GetSize           March 2011


   fromTrans

      A transaction ID as returned by the RPC AFSVolTransCreate.

   fromDate

      The meaning and format of this argument is the same as the
      fromDate argument described in Section 4.1.

   Output arguments:

   size

      The size of the dump, represented in octets.

   The call is aborted with an error for all of the same conditions
   where AFSVolDump aborts with an error as described in [AFS3-VVL],
   with the appropriate error code.

4.3.  AFSVolDumpV2 Flags

   The AFSVolDumpV2 RPC allows the caller to optionally specify a set of
   0 or more flags which slightly alter the behavior of the AFSVolDumpV2
   call.  Only one such flag is currently defined:

   VOLDUMPV2_OMITDIRS = 1

      Normally, an incremental volume dump generated by AFSVolDump or
      AFSVolDumpV2 includes the data for all directories in the volume,
      even if nothing in that directory has changed.  This is to allow
      data in an incremental dump to still be easily accessible even if
      the incremental dump is the only dump available.  If the flag
      VOLDUMPV2_OMITDIRS is specified, the generated volume dump will
      only contain directory data if the directory was modified at or
      after the specified fromDate.  This reduces the size of the dump,
      but can make it more difficult to retrieve data from the dump if
      the original full volume dump is lost.


5.  RPC Interface

   One new RPC code is defined for the Volume Service: AFSVolGetSizeV2.
   Additionally, a new namespace for AFSVolGetSizeV2 flags is defined,
   and one flag in that namespace is defined.

5.1.  AFSVolGetSizeV2

   This behaves exactly the same way as the existing AFSVolGetSize RPC
   (Section 4.2), except for the addition of the flags argument, which
   behaves similarly to the flags argument of the existing AFSVolDumpV2
   RPC (Section 4.3).

       AFSVolGetSizeV2(IN afs_int32 fromTrans, IN afs_int32 fromDate,
                       IN afs_int32 flags,
                       OUT struct volintSize *size) = XXX;

   Input arguments:

   fromTrans

      A transaction ID as returned by the RPC AFSVolTransCreate.

   fromDate

      The meaning and format of this argument is the same as the
      fromDate argument described in Section 4.1.  Since this is
      represented as a signed 32-bit integer, problems may occur if
      dates beyond 2038 are specified.  A future protocol revision will
      improve the date representation in AFSVol RPCs to address this
      problem.

   flags

      Zero or more flags combined via a bitwise OR operation.  The
      available flags are described below in Section 5.2.

   Output arguments:

   size

      The size of the dump, represented in octets.

   The call is aborted with an error for all of the same conditions
   where AFSVolDump aborts with an error as described in [AFS3-VVL],
   with the appropriate error code.

5.2.  AFSVolGetSizeV2 Flags

   The intention of the AFSVolGetSizeV2 RPC is to provide an extension
   to the AFSVolGetSize RPC, similar to how AFSVolDumpV2 provided an
   analogous extension to AFSVolDump.  As such, the only defined
   AFSVolGetSizeV2 flag corresponds to the single existing AFSVolDumpV2
   flag, though there is no requirement that every AFSVolGetSizeV2 flag

Internet-Draft        AFS-3 AFSVol Flexible GetSize           March 2011


   have an AFSVolDumpV2 equivalent, or vice versa.

   VOLGETSIZEV2_OMITDIRS = 1

      This is the AFSVolGetSizeV2 analogue of the AFSVolDumpV2 flag
      VOLDUMPV2_OMITDIRS.  If this flag is set, the volume dump size
      will be calculated for a dump generated by an AFSVolDumpV2 call
      where the flag VOLDUMPV2_OMITDIRS (Section 4.3) was set.  Such a
      dump does not include directory information for directories that
      have not changed since the specified fromDate.


6.  Security Considerations

   The results of the AFSVolGetSize and AFSVolGetSizeV2 RPCs are not
   normally considered sensitive information, though they may be
   computationally intensive to calculate.  As such, current AFS-3
   implementations typically use some per-server superuser list (such as
   the AFS-3 Basic OverSeer UserList) to control access to the
   AFSVolGetSize RPC to reduce potential Denial of Service attack
   vectors.  While this practice is OPTIONAL for implementations and
   subject to site-specific policies, any access control restrictions
   that apply to the AFSVolGetSize RPC SHOULD also apply to
   AFSVolGetSizeV2 (and vice versa) for consistency.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of the IANA.


8.  AFS-3 Registry Considerations

   This document requires the registration of one RPC code point for the
   AFSVolGetSizeV2 RPC detailed above in Section 5.1 by the the AFS-3
   Assigned Numbers Registry.

   This document also requests that the AFS-3 Assigned Numbers Registry
   assumes control over the AFSVolGetSizeV2 flags namespace.  This
   document defines one flag in this namespace,
   AFSVOLGETSIZEV2_OMITDIRS, detailed above in Section 5.2, with the
   value of 1.
