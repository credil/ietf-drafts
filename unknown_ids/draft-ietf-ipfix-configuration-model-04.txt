Internet-Draft    IPFIX/PSAMP Configuration Data Model      October 2009


1.  Introduction

   IPFIX and PSAMP compliant Monitoring Devices (routers, switches,
   monitoring probes, Collectors etc.) offer various configuration
   possibilities that allow adapting network monitoring to the goals and
   purposes of the application, such as accounting and charging, traffic
   analysis, performance monitoring, security monitoring.  The use of a
   common vendor-independent configuration data model for IPFIX and
   PSAMP compliant Monitoring Devices facilitates network management and
   configuration, especially if Monitoring Devices of different
   implementers and/or manufacturers are deployed simultaneously.  On
   the one hand, a vendor-independent configuration data model helps
   storing and managing the configuration data of Monitoring Devices in
   a consistent format.  On the other hand, it can be used for local and
   remote configuration of Monitoring Devices.  However, this requires
   that Monitoring Devices natively support the configuration data
   model, or that a mapping between the configuration data model and the
   device-specific representation of configuration data is provided.

   The purpose of this document is the specification of a vendor-
   independent configuration data model that covers the commonly
   available configuration parameters of Selection Processes, Caches,
   Exporting Processes, and Collecting Processes.  The configuration
   data model is defined using UML (Unified Modeling Language) class
   diagrams [UML] while the actual configuration data is encoded in
   Extensible Markup Language (XML) [W3C.REC-xml-20040204].  An XML
   document conforming to the configuration data model contains the
   configuration data of one Monitoring Device.  In order to ensure
   compatibility with the NETCONF protocol [RFC4741], YANG
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang] is used as the modeling language.  If
   required, the YANG specification of the configuration data model can
   be converted into XML Schema language [W3C.REC-xmlschema-0-20041028]
   using the pyang tool [YANG-WEB].  YANG provides mechanisms to adapt
   the configuration data model to device-specific constraints and to
   augment the model with additional device-specific or vendor-specific
   parameters.

   For the configuration of remote Monitoring Devices, an appropriate
   protocol is needed to transfer the XML encoded configuration data.
   The configuration data model is compatible with the NETCONF protocol
   [RFC4741].  However, alternative protocols, such as the Simple Object
   Access Protocol (SOAP) [W3C.REC-soap12-part1-20070427], are also
   suitable for transferring XML data from a network management system
   to a Monitoring Device.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.1.  IPFIX Documents Overview

   The IPFIX protocol [RFC5101] provides network administrators with
   access to IP Flow information.  The architecture for the export of
   measured IP Flow information out of an IPFIX Exporting Process to a
   Collecting Process is defined in [RFC5470], per the requirements
   defined in [RFC3917].  The IPFIX protocol [RFC5101] specifies how
   IPFIX Data Records and Templates are carried via a number of
   transport protocols from IPFIX Exporting Processes to IPFIX
   Collecting Process.  IPFIX has a formal description of IPFIX
   Information Elements, their name, type and additional semantic
   information, as specified in [RFC5102].  [I-D.ietf-ipfix-mib]
   specifies the IPFIX Management Information Base (IPFIX MIB).
   Finally, [RFC5472] describes what type of applications can use the
   IPFIX protocol and how they can use the information provided.  It
   furthermore shows how the IPFIX framework relates to other
   architectures and frameworks.  The storage of IPFIX Messages in a
   file is specified in [I-D.ietf-ipfix-file].

1.2.  PSAMP Documents Overview

   The framework for packet selection and reporting [RFC5474] enables
   network elements to select subsets of packets by statistical and
   other methods, and to export a stream of reports on the selected
   packets to a Collector.  The set of packet selection techniques
   (Sampling, Filtering, and hashing) standardized by PSAMP are
   described in [RFC5475].  The PSAMP protocol [RFC5476] specifies the
   export of packet information from a PSAMP Exporting Process to a
   PSAMP Collector.  Instead of exporting PSAMP Packet Reports, the
   stream of selected packets may also serve as input to the generation
   of IPFIX Flow Records.  Like IPFIX, PSAMP has a formal description of
   its Information Elements, their name, type and additional semantic
   information.  The PSAMP information model is defined in [RFC5477].
   [I-D.ietf-psamp-mib] describes the PSAMP Management Information Base
   (PSAMP MIB).


2.  Terminology

   This document adopts the terminologies used in [RFC5101],
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-file], and [RFC5476].  As in these documents, all
   specific terms have the first letter of a word capitalized when used
   in this document.  The following listing indicates in which
   references the definitions of those terms that are commonly used
   throughout this document can be found:

   The terms Metering Process and Exporting Process have different
   definitions in [RFC5101] and [RFC5476].  In the scope of this
   document, these terms are used according to the following definitions
   which cover the deployment in both PSAMP Devices and IPFIX Devices:

   Metering Process:  The Metering Process generates IPFIX Flow Records
      or PSAMP Packet Reports, depending on its deployment as part of an
      IPFIX Device or PSAMP Device.  Inputs to the process are packets
      observed at one or multiple Observation Points belonging to a
      single Observation Domain, as well as characteristics describing
      the packet treatment at these Observation Points.  The function of
      the Metering Process is split into two types of functional blocks:
      Selection Processes and Caches.

   Exporting Process:  Depending on its deployment as part of an IPFIX
      Device or PSAMP Device, the Exporting Process sends IPFIX Flow
      Records or PSAMP Packet Reports to one or more Collecting
      Processes.  The IPFIX Flow Records or PSAMP Packet Reports are
      generated by one or more Metering Processes.




Muenz, et al.  draft-ietf-ipfix-configuration-model-04.txt      [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    IPFIX/PSAMP Configuration Data Model      October 2009


   In addition to the existing IPFIX and PSAMP terminology, the
   following terms are defined:

   Cache:  The Cache is a functional block in a Metering Process which
      maintains IPFIX Flow Records or PSAMP Packet Reports.  According
      to [RFC5101], the maintenance of Flow Records may include creating
      new records, updating existing ones, computing Flow statistics,
      deriving further Flow properties, detecting Flow expiration,
      passing Flow Records to the Exporting Process, and deleting Flow
      Records.  The maintenance of Packet Reports covers the same set of
      functions.

   Cache Layout:  The Cache Layout defines the superset of fields that
      are included in the Packet Reports or Flow Records maintained by
      the Cache.  The fields are specified by the corresponding
      Information Elements.  In general, the largest possible subset of
      the specified fields is derived for every Packet Report or Flow
      Record.  More specific rules about which fields must be included
      are given in Section 4.3.1.

   Cache Mode:  The Cache Mode specifies whether Packet Reports or Flow
      Records are generated by the Cache.  In the case of Flow Records,
      it also specifies the Flow expiration policy.

   Monitoring Device:  A Monitoring Device implements at least one of
      the functional blocks specified in the context of IPFIX or PSAMP.
      In particular, the term Monitoring Device encompasses Exporters,
      Collectors, IPFIX Devices, and PSAMP Devices.

   Selected Packet Stream:  The Selected Packet Stream is the set of all
      packets selected by a Selection Process.


3.  Structure of the Configuration Data Model

   The IPFIX reference model in [RFC5470] describes Metering Processes,
   Exporting Processes, and Collecting Processes as functional blocks of
   IPFIX Devices.  The PSAMP framework [RFC5474] provides the
   corresponding information for PSAMP Devices and introduces Selection
   Processes as functional blocks within Metering Processes.  In
   Section 2 of the document, the Cache is defined as another functional
   block within Metering Processes.  Further explanations about the
   relationship between Selection Processes and Caches are given later
   on in this section.  IPFIX File Reader and File Writer are defined as
   specific kinds of Exporting and Collecting Processes in
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-file].

   Monitoring Device implementations usually maintain the separation of



Muenz, et al.  draft-ietf-ipfix-configuration-model-04.txt      [Page 8]

Internet-Draft    IPFIX/PSAMP Configuration Data Model      October 2009


   various functional blocks although they do not necessarily implement
   all of them.  Furthermore, they provide various configuration
   possibilities; some of them are specified as mandatory by the IPFIX
   protocol [RFC5101] or PSAMP protocol [RFC5476].  The configuration
   data model enables the setting of commonly available configuration
   parameters for Selection Processes, Caches, Exporting Processes, and
   Collecting Processes.  In addition, it allows specifying the
   composition of functional blocks within a Monitoring Device
   configuration and their linkage with Observation Points.

   In a Monitoring Device implementation, the functionality of the
   Metering Process is commonly split into packet Sampling and Filtering
   functions performed by Selection Processes, and the maintenance of
   Flow Records and Packet Reports performed by Caches.  Figure 1
   illustrates this separation with the example of a basic Metering
   Process consisting of one Selection Process and one Cache.

               +-----------------------------------+
               | Metering Process                  |
               | +-----------+ Selected            |
      Observed | | Selection | Packet    +-------+ |  Stream of
      Packet  -->| Process   |---------->| Cache |--> Flow Records or
      Stream   | +-----------+ Stream    +-------+ |  Packet Reports
               +-----------------------------------+

     Figure 1: Selection Process and Cache forming a Metering Process

   The configuration data model adopts the separation of Selection
   Processes and Caches in order to support the flexible configuration
   and combination of these functional blocks.  As defined in [RFC5476],
   the Selection Process takes the Observed Packet Stream as its input
   and selects a subset of that stream as its output (Selected Packet
   Stream).  The action of the Selection Process on a single packet of
   its input is defined by a Primitive Selector or a Composite Selector.
   The Cache generates Flow Records or Packet Reports from the Selected
   Packet Stream, depending on the configured Cache Mode.

   The Observed Packet Stream at the input of a Selection Process MUST
   only contain packets originating from a single Observation Domain.
   Similarly, the Selected Packet Stream at the input of a Cache MUST
   only contain packets originating from a single Observation Domain.
   Packets from Observation Points belonging to different Observation
   Domains MUST NOT enter the same Selection Process or the same Cache.

   Beyond the basic Metering Process shown in Figure 1, the
   configuration data model enables the specification of more complex
   configurations.  A single Cache may process the output of multiple
   Selection Processes.  The Selected Packet Stream may be copied to



Muenz, et al.  draft-ietf-ipfix-configuration-model-04.txt      [Page 9]

Internet-Draft    IPFIX/PSAMP Configuration Data Model      October 2009


   enter several Caches, for example one Cache that generates Flow
   Records and another Cache that generates Packet Reports.  Selection
   Processes can also be cascaded, such that the Selected Packet Stream
   at the output of one Selection Process is passed to another Selection
   Process.  Cascading Selection Processes can be useful in specific
   contexts such as the example in Section 7.3.

   The selection of parameters in the configuration data model is based
   on configuration issues discussed in the IPFIX and PSAMP documents
   [RFC3917], [RFC5101], [RFC5470], [RFC5476], [RFC5474], and [RFC5475].
   Furthermore, the structure and content of the IPFIX MIB module
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-mib] and the PSAMP MIB module [I-D.ietf-psamp-mib]
   have been taken into consideration.  Consistency between the
   configuration data model and the IPFIX and PSAMP MIB modules is an
   intended goal.  Therefore, parameters in the configuration data model
   are named according to corresponding managed objects.  Certain IPFIX
   MIB objects containing state data have been adopted as state
   parameters in the configuration data model.  State parameters cannot
   be configured, yet their values can be queried from the Monitoring
   Device.

   The next section explains how UML class diagrams are deployed to
   illustrate the structure of the configuration data model.
   Thereafter, Section 3.2 and Section 3.3 explain the class diagrams
   for the configuration of Exporters and Collectors, respectively.
   Each of the presented classes contains specific configuration
   parameters which are specified in Section 4.  The formal definition
   of the configuration data model in YANG is given in Section 6.
   Section 7 illustrates the usage of the model with example
   configurations in XML.  Section 5 gives a short introduction to YANG
   concepts that allow adapting the configuration data model to the
   capabilities of a device.

3.1.  UML Representation

   We use UML class diagrams [UML] to explain the structure of the
   configuration data model.  The attributes of the classes are the
   configuration or state parameters of the Monitoring Device.

                 Figure 2: UML example: Destination class

   As an example, Figure 2 shows the UML diagram of the Destination
   class, which is specified in more detail in Section 4.4.1.  The upper
   box contains the name of the class.  The lower box lists the
   attributes of the class.  The only parameters that MUST be configured
   by the user are name, transportProtocol, and destinationIpAddress.
   The remaining parameters have either defaults values, specific
   properties, or a multiplicity indicator starting with zero

   A default value is indicated after the attribute behind the equality
   symbol ("=").  It means that this default value MUST be used by the
   Monitoring Device if the parameter is not configured by the user.  In
   the example, IPFIX version 10 must be used if not configured
   differently.  For destinationPort, two default values are indicated,
   namely the registered ports for IPFIX with and without transport
   layer security (i.e., DTLS or TLS), respectively.  Note that such
   alternative default values cannot be formally specified in YANG.
   Instead, they are described in the "description" statement.

   An attribute with property "{opt.}", such as sendBufferSize in the
   Destination class, represents a parameter that MAY be configured by
   the user.  Otherwise, the Monitoring Device will assign an
   appropriate value for this parameter.  As a result, the parameter
   will always exist in the configuration data, yet it is not mandatory
   for the user to configure it.  Note that this property cannot be
   formally specified in YANG.  Instead, it is described in the



Muenz, et al.  draft-ietf-ipfix-configuration-model-04.txt     [Page 11]

Internet-Draft    IPFIX/PSAMP Configuration Data Model      October 2009


   "description" statement.

   The property "{SCTP only}" ("{UDP only}") means that the
   corresponding parameters are only available if the transport protocol
   is SCTP (UDP).  In YANG, this is formalized in a "when" statement.

   Another property not shown in the example is "{readOnly}" specifying
   state parameters which cannot be configured by the user.

   An attribute with a multiplicity indicator of "[0..1]" represents an
   OPTIONAL configuration parameter.  The parameter is not included in
   the configuration data unless the user configures it.  Typically, the
   absence of the parameter has a specific meaning.  For example, not
   configuring rateLimit in the Destination class means that no rate
   limiting will be applied to the exported data.

   A multiplicity indicator of "[0..*]" means that this parameter MAY be
   configured multiple times with different values.  In the example,
   multiple local IP addresses may be configured if SCTP is transport
   protocol.  Note that attributes without this multiplicity indicator
   MUST NOT appear more than once in each object of the class.

   If some parameters are related to each other, it can make sense to
   group these parameters in a subclass.  This is especially useful if
   different subclasses represent choices of different parameter sets,
   or if the parameters of a subclass may appear multiple times.  For
   example, the Destination class MAY contain the parameters of the
   TransportLayerSecurity subclass.

   Classes define the structure of the objects of a specific
   configuration.  Objects and their parameters are encoded as XML
   elements.  So, one object of the Destination class corresponds to one
   occurrence of

     <destination>
       <name>my-destination</name>
       ...
     </destination>

   There are various possibilities how objects of classes can be related
   to each other.  In the scope of this document, we use two different
   types of relationship between objects: aggregation and unidirectional
   association.  In UML class diagrams, two different arrow types are
   used as shown in Figure 3.

             (a) Aggregation     (b) Unidirectional association

            Figure 3: Class relationships in UML class diagrams

   Aggregation means that one object is part of the other object.  In
   Figure 3 (a), an object of class B is part of an object of class A.
   This corresponds to nested XML elements:

     <a>
       <b>
         ...
       </b>
       ...
     </a>

   Note that we write class names starting with a capital letter
   throughout this document.  The corresponding XML elements use
   identical names starting with an uncapitalized letter because they
   represent objects, not classes.

   A unidirectional association is a reference to an object.  In
   Figure 3 (b), an object of class A contains a reference to an object
   of class B. This corresponds to separate XML elements that are not
   nested.  To distinguish different objects of class B, class B must
   have a key.  In the configuration data model, all keys are string
   parameters called "name", corresponding to XML elements <name>.  The
   names must be unique within the XML document.  The reference to a
   specific object of class B is encoded with an XML element <b> which
   contains the corresponding object name.  In the given example, this
   may look as follows:

     <a>
       ...
       <b>foo</b>
       ...
     </a>

     <b>
       <name>foo</name>
       ...
     </b>

   In Figure 3, the indicated numbers define the multiplicity:





Muenz, et al.  draft-ietf-ipfix-configuration-model-04.txt     [Page 13]

Internet-Draft    IPFIX/PSAMP Configuration Data Model      October 2009


      "1": one only
      "0..*": zero or more
      "1..*": one or more

   In the case of aggregation, the multiplicity indicates how many
   objects of one class may be included in one object of the other
   class.  In Figure 3 (a), an object of class A may contain an
   arbitrary number of objects of class B. In the case of unidirectional
   association, the multiplicity at the arrowhead specifies the number
   of objects of a given class that may be referred to.  The
   multiplicity at the arrow tail specifies how many different objects
   of one class may refer to a single object of the other class.  In
   Figure 3 (b), an object of class A refers to single object of class
   B. One object of class B can be referred to from an arbitrary number
   of objects of class A.

   Similar to classes that are referenced in UML associations, classes
   which contain configuration parameters and which occur with
   multiplicity greater than one in an aggregation relationship must
   have a key which allows distinguishing different objects.  This key
   is necessary because every configuration parameter must be
   addressable in order to manipulate or delete it.  The values of the
   key must be unique in the scope of the aggregating object.  Hence,
   under the assumption that class B in Figure 3 (a) contains at least
   one configuration parameter, all objects of class B belonging to the
   same object of class A must have different key values.  Again, the
   key appears as an attribute called "name" in all concerned classes.

   A class which contains state parameters but no configuration
   parameters, such as the Template class (see Section 4.7.1), does not
   have a key.  This is because state parameters cannot be manipulated
   or deleted, and therefore do not need to be addressable.

   Note that the usage of keys as described above is also required by
   YANG [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang] which mandates the existence of a key for
   all elements which appear in lists of configuration data.

   The configuration data model for IPFIX and PSAMP makes use of
   unidirectional associations to specify the data flow between
   different functional blocks.  For example, if the output of a
   Selection Process is processed by a Cache, this corresponds to an
   object of the SelectionProcess class that contains a reference to an
   object of the Cache class.  The configuration data model does not
   mandate that such a reference exists for every functional block that
   has an output.  If such a reference is absent, the output is dropped
   without any further processing.  Although such configurations are
   incomplete, we do not consider them as invalid as they may
   temporarily occur if a Monitoring Device is configured in multiple



Muenz, et al.  draft-ietf-ipfix-configuration-model-04.txt     [Page 14]

Internet-Draft    IPFIX/PSAMP Configuration Data Model      October 2009


   steps.  Also, it might be useful to pre-configure certain functions
   of a Monitoring Device in order to be able to switch to a new
   configuration more quickly.

3.2.  Exporter Configuration

   Figure 4 below shows the main classes of the configuration data model
   which are involved in the configuration of an IPFIX or PSAMP
   Exporter.  The role of the classes can be briefly summarized as
   follows:

   o  The ObservationPoint class specifies an Observation Point (i.e.,
      an interface or linecard) of the Monitoring Device at which
      packets are captured for traffic measurements.  An object of the
      ObservationPoint class may be associated with one or more objects
      of the SelectionProcess class configuring Selection Processes that
      process the observed packets in parallel.  As long as an
      ObservationPoint object is specified without any references to
      SelectionProcess objects, the Observation Point is not deployed
      for traffic measurements.

   o  The SelectionProcess class contains the configuration parameters
      of a Selection Process.  The Selection Process may be composed of
      a single Selector or a sequence of Selectors, defining a Primitive
      or Composite Selector, respectively.

      The Selection Process selects packets from an Observed Packet
      Stream originating from one or multiple Observation Points.
      Therefore, a SelectionProcess object MAY be referred to from
      multiple ObservationPoint objects.  The corresponding Observation
      Points must belong to the same Observation Domain.

      A Selection Process MAY pass the Selected Packet Stream to one or
      multiple Caches.  Therefore, the SelectionProcess class enables
      references to objects of the Cache class.

      It is possible to cascade different Selection Processes.  In this
      case, the Selected Packet Stream at the output of one or multiple
      Selection Processes is passed to the input of another Selection
      Process.  Therefore, a SelectionProcess object MAY be referred to
      from multiple SelectionProcess objects.  For the same reason, one
      SelectionProcess object may refer to other objects of the same
      class.  When cascading multiple Selection Processes, it must be
      ensured that all packets entering a Selection Process have been
      observed at Observation Points belonging to the same Observation
      Domain.  A configuration example is given later in Section 7.3.

      If a Selection Process is configured without any reference to



Muenz, et al.  draft-ietf-ipfix-configuration-model-04.txt     [Page 15]

Internet-Draft    IPFIX/PSAMP Configuration Data Model      October 2009


      Selection Processes or Caches that receive the selected packets,
      the selected packets are not accounted in any Packet Report or
      Flow Record.

   o  The Cache class contains configuration parameters of a Cache.  A
      Cache may receive the output of one or more Selection Processes
      and maintains corresponding Packet Reports or Flow Records.
      Therefore, an object of the Cache class MAY be referred to from
      multiple SelectionProcess objects.  However, the configuration
      MUST ensure that all packets entering the Selection Process have
      been observed at Observation Points belonging to the same
      Observation Domain.

      Configuration parameters of the Cache class specify the size of
      the Cache, the Cache Mode and Layout, and expiration parameters.
      The Cache Mode determines if Packet Reports or Flow Records are
      generated.

      A Cache MAY pass its output to one or multiple Exporting Process.
      Therefore, the Cache class enables references to one or multiple
      objects of the ExportingProcess class.  If a Cache object does not
      specify any reference to an ExportingProcess object, the Cache
      output is dropped.

   o  The ExportingProcess class contains configuration parameters of an
      Exporting Process.  It includes various transport protocol
      specific parameters and the export destinations.  An object of the
      ExportingProcess class MAY be referred to from multiple objects of
      the Cache class.

      An Exporting Process MAY be configured as a File Writer according
      to [I-D.ietf-ipfix-file].

   Figure 5 below shows the main classes of the configuration data model
   which are involved in the configuration of a Collector.  An object of
   the CollectingProcess class specifies the local IP addresses,
   transport protocols and port numbers of a Collecting Process.
   Alternatively, the Collecting Process MAY be configured as a File
   Reader according to [I-D.ietf-ipfix-file].

   An object of the CollectingProcess class may refer to one or multiple
   ExportingProcess objects configuring Exporting Processes that
   reexport the received data.  As an example, an Exporting Process can
   be configured as a File Writer in order to save the received IPFIX
   Messages in a file.

4.  Configuration Parameters

   This section specifies the configuration and state parameters of the
   configuration data model separately for each class.  Parameters
   serving as keys are depicted in brackets.

4.1.  ObservationPoint Class

    +-------------------------------+
    | ObservationPoint              |
    +-------------------------------+          1 +--------------------+
    | name                          |<>----------| Interface/Linecard |
    | observationPointId {readOnly} |            +--------------------+
    | observationDomainId           |
    |                               | 0..*  0..* +--------------------+
    |                               |----------->| SelectionProcess   |
    +-------------------------------+            +--------------------+

    +------------------+   +----------------------------------+
    | Interface        |   | Linecard                         |
    +------------------+   +----------------------------------+
    | ifIndex/ifName   |   | entPhysicalIndex/entPhysicalName |
    | direction = both |   | direction = both                 |
    +------------------+   +----------------------------------+

                     Figure 6: ObservationPoint class

   Figure 6 shows the ObservationPoint class that identifies an
   Observation Point of the Monitoring Device.  The Observation Point
   can either be an interface or a linecard.

   An object of the ObservationPoint class MUST specify the ID of the
   Observation Domain the Observation Point belongs to.  Observation
   Points that are configured with the same Observation Domain ID belong
   to the same Observation Domain.

   The Observation Point ID (i.e., the value of the Information Element
   observationPointId [RFC5102]) is assigned by the Monitoring Device.
   It appears as a state parameter in the ObservationPoint class.

   The configuration parameters to identify an interface or a linecard
   are as follows:

   ifIndex/ifName (interface only):  Either the index or name of the
      interface MUST be specified according to corresponding objects in
      the IF-MIB [RFC2863].





Muenz, et al.  draft-ietf-ipfix-configuration-model-04.txt     [Page 18]

Internet-Draft    IPFIX/PSAMP Configuration Data Model      October 2009


   entPhysicalIndex/entPhysicalName (linecard only):  Either the index
      or name of the linecard MUST be specified according to
      corresponding objects in the ENTITY-MIB [RFC4133].

   direction:  This parameter specifies if ingress traffic, egress
      traffic, or both ingress and egress traffic is captured, using the
      values "ingress", "egress", and "both", respectively.  If not
      configured, ingress and egress traffic is captured (i.e., the
      default value is "both").  If not applicable (e.g., in the case of
      a sniffing interface in promiscuous mode), the value of this
      parameter is ignored.

   An ObservationPoint object MAY refer to one or multiple
   SelectionProcess objects configuring Selection Processes that process
   the observed packets in parallel.

4.2.  SelectionProcess Class

         +--------------------------------+
         | SelectionProcess               |
         +--------------------------------+       1..* +----------+
         | name                           |<>----------| Selector |
         | selectionSequenceId {readOnly} |            +----------+
         |                                | 0..*
         |                                |<---+
         |                                |    |
         |                                |----+
         |                                | 0..*
         |                                |
         |                                | 0..*  0..* +----------+
         |                                |----------->| Cache    |
         +--------------------------------+            +----------+

                     Figure 7: SelectionProcess class

   Figure 7 shows the SelectionProcess class.  The SelectionProcess
   class contains the configuration parameters of a Selection Process
   which selects packets from the Observed Packet Stream at its input
   and outputs the Selected Packet Stream to one or multiple other
   Selection Processes or Caches.  A non-empty ordered list defines a
   sequence of Selectors.  The actions defined by the Selectors are
   applied to the stream of incoming packet in the specified order.

   The state parameter selectionSequenceId contains the Selection
   Sequence ID (i.e., the value of the Information Element
   selectionSequenceId [RFC5477]) which is assigned by the Monitoring
   Device.  The Selection Sequence ID MUST be unique within the
   Observation Domain as required by [RFC5477].

Internet-Draft    IPFIX/PSAMP Configuration Data Model      October 2009


   The output of one Selection Process MAY be processed by other
   Selection Processes.  Therefore, the SelectionProcess class allows
   references to itself, meaning that one SelectionProcess object MAY
   refer to other SelectionProcess objects.

   A SelectionProcess object MAY include references to one or more
   objects of the Cache class configuring Caches that receive the
   Selected Packet Stream and generate corresponding Packet Reports or
   Flow Records.

4.2.1.  Selector Class

    | Selector                             |

    +--------------------------------------+        +-----------------+

                         Figure 8: Selector class

   The Selector class in Figure 8 contains the configuration and state
   parameters of a Selector.  Standardized PSAMP Sampling and Filtering
   methods are described in [RFC5475]; their configuration parameters
   are specified in corresponding sampler (SampCountBased,
   SampTimeBased, SampRandOutOfN, SampUniProb) or filter (FilterMatch,
   FilterHash) classes.  In addition, the SelectAll class, which has no
   parameters, is used for a Selector that selects all packets.  The
   Selector class includes exactly one of these sampler and filter
   classes, depending on the applied method.

   The state parameter selectorId contains the Selector ID (i.e., the
   value of the Information Element selectorId [RFC5477]) assigned by
   the Monitoring Device.  The Selector ID MUST be unique within the
   Observation Domain as required by [RFC5477].

   As state parameters, the Selector class contains the Selector
   statistics packetsObserved and packetsDropped that correspond to the
   objects of the ipfixSelectorStatsTable in the IPFIX MIB module
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-mib].

        +----------------+

                         Figure 9: Sampler classes

   The Sampler classes in Figure 9 contain the configuration parameters
   of specific Sampling algorithms:

   packetInterval, packetSpace:  For systematic count-based sampling,
      packetInterval defines the number of packets that are
      consecutively sampled between gaps of length packetSpace.  These
      parameters correspond to the Information Elements
      samplingPacketInterval and samplingPacketSpace [RFC5477].

   timeInterval, timeSpace:  For systematic time-based sampling,
      timeInterval defines the time interval during which all arriving
      packets are sampled. timeSpace is the gap between two sampling
      intervals.  These parameters correspond to the Information
      Elements samplingTimeInterval and samplingTimeSpace [RFC5477].
      The unit is microseconds.

   size, population:  For n-out-of-N random sampling, size defines the
      number of elements taken from the parent population. population
      defines the number of elements in the parent population.  These
      parameters correspond to the Information Elements samplingSize and
      samplingPopulation [RFC5477].

   probability:  For uniform probabilistic sampling, probability defines
      the sampling probability.  This parameter corresponds to the
      Information Element samplingProbability [RFC5477].

                         Figure 10: Filter classes

   The Filter classes in Figure 10 contain the configuration parameters
   of specific Filtering methods.  For property match filtering, the
   configuration parameters are:

   ieId, ieName, ieEnterpriseNumber:  The property to be matched is
      specified by either ieId or ieName, specifying the ID or name of
      the Information Element, respectively. ieEnterpriseNumber MUST be
      used for enterprise-specific Information Elements.  If
      ieEnterpriseNumber is omitted or zero, this is Information Element
      is not enterprise-specific but registered at IANA.

   value:  Matching value.

   For hash-based filtering, the configuration parameters are:

   hashFunction:  Hash function to be used.  The following parameter
      values are defined by the configuration data model:
      *  BOB: BOB Hash Function as specified in [RFC5475], Appendix A.2
      *  IPSX: IP Shift-XOR (IPSX) Hash Function as specified in
         [RFC5475], Appendix A.1
      *  CRC: CRC-32 function as specified in [RFC1141]
      Default value is "BOB".

Internet-Draft    IPFIX/PSAMP Configuration Data Model      October 2009


   ipPayloadOffset, ipPayloadSize:  ipPayloadOffset and ipPayloadSize
      configure the offset and the size of the payload section used as
      input to the hash function.  Default values are 0 and 8,
      respectively, corresponding to the minimum configurable values
      according to [RFC5476], Section 6.2.5.6.  These parameters
      correspond to the Information Elements hashIPPayloadOffset and
      hashIPPayloadSize [RFC5477].

   digestOutput:  digestOutput enables or disables the inclusion of the
      packet digest in the resulting PSAMP Packet Report.  This requires
      that the Cache Layout of the Cache generating the Packet Reports
      includes a digestHashValue field.  This parameter corresponds to
      the Information Element hashDigestOutput [RFC5477].

   initialiserValue:  Initializer value to the hash function.  This
      parameter corresponds to the Information Element
      hashInitialiserValue [RFC5477].  If not configured by the user,
      the monitoring device arbitrarily chooses an initializer value.

   One or more ranges of matching hash values are defined by the min and
   max parameters of the SelectedRange subclass.  These parameters
   correspond to the Information Elements hashSelectedRangeMin and
   hashSelectedRangeMax [RFC5477].

                          Figure 11: Cache class

   Figure 11 shows the Cache class that contains the configuration and
   state parameters of a Cache.  The configuration parameters of the
   Cache class are as follows:




Muenz, et al.  draft-ietf-ipfix-configuration-model-04.txt     [Page 23]

Internet-Draft    IPFIX/PSAMP Configuration Data Model      October 2009


   cacheMode:  Configures the Cache Mode.  The following parameter
      values are specified by the configuration data model:
      *  immediate: Data Records expire after the first packet
      *  timeout: Data Records expire after active or inactive timeout
      *  permanent: Data Records never expire, but are periodically
         exported with interval set by the active timeout
      In the case of "immediate", PSAMP Packet Reports are generated.
      Otherwise, IPFIX Flow Records are generated.

   maxRecords:  Maximum number of Data Records in the Cache.  If not
      configured by the user, the Monitoring Device sets this parameter.

   activeTimeout:  This parameter configures the active timeout in
      milliseconds.  It is not available for Cache Mode "immediate".
      The parameter value zero indicates infinity, meaning that there is
      no active timeout.  If not configured by the user, the Monitoring
      Device sets this parameter.
      In the case of Cache Mode "timeout", the active timeout defines
      the time after which a Flow Record is expired even though packets
      matching this Flow are still received by the Cache.  In the case
      of Cache Mode "permanent", the active timeout defines the interval
      for periodical export of Flow Records.

   inactiveTimeout:  This parameter configures the inactive timeout in
      milliseconds.  It is not available for Cache Modes "immediate" and
      "permanent".  The parameter value zero indicates infinity, meaning
      that there is no inactive timeout.  If not configured by the user,
      the Monitoring Device sets this parameter.
      The inactive timeout defines the time after which a Flow Record is
      expired if no packets matching this Flow are received by the
      Cache.

   An object of the Cache class includes an object of the CacheLayout
   class that defines which fields are included in the Packet Reports or
   Flow Records.  A Cache object MAY refer to one or multiple
   ExportingProcess objects configuring different Exporting Processes.

   As state parameters, the Cache class contains the Metering Process
   statistics activeFlows, inactiveFlows, and cacheDataRecords that
   correspond to the objects of the ipfixMeteringProcessStatsTable of
   the IPFIX MIB module [I-D.ietf-ipfix-mib].

                       Figure 12: CacheLayout class

   A Cache generates and maintains Packet Reports or Flow Records
   containing information that has been extracted from the incoming
   stream of packets.  Using the CacheField class, the CacheLayout class
   specifies the superset of fields that are included in the Packet
   Reports or Flow Records (see Figure 12).

   If Packet Reports are generated (i.e., if Cache Mode is "immediate"),
   every field specified by the Cache Layout MUST be included in the
   resulting Packet Report unless the corresponding Information Element
   is not applicable or cannot be derived from the content or treatment
   of the incoming packet.

   If Flow Records are generated (i.e., if Cache Mode is "timeout" or
   "permanent"), every Flow Key field specified by the Cache Layout MUST
   be included as Flow Key in the resulting Flow Record unless the
   corresponding Information Element is not applicable or cannot be
   derived from the content or treatment of the incoming packet.  Two
   packets MUST be accounted by different Flow Records if different
   subsets of the Flow Key fields are applicable or derivable.  Every
   non-key field specified by the Cache Layout MUST be included in the
   resulting Flow Record unless the corresponding Information Element is
   not applicable or cannot be derived for the given Flow.

   For example, if a non-key field specifies an Information Element
   whose value is determined by the first packet observed within a Flow
   (which is the default rule according to [RFC5102]), this field MUST
   be included in the resulting Flow Record if it can be determined from
   the first packet of the Flow.

   The CacheLayout class does not have any parameters.  The
   configuration parameters of the CacheField class are as follows:




Muenz, et al.  draft-ietf-ipfix-configuration-model-04.txt     [Page 25]

Internet-Draft    IPFIX/PSAMP Configuration Data Model      October 2009


   ieId, ieName, ieEnterpriseNumber:  These parameters specify a field
      by the combination of the Information Element identifier or name,
      and the Information Element enterprise number.  Either ieId or
      ieName MUST be specified. ieEnterpriseNumber MUST be used for
      enterprise-specific Information Elements.  If ieEnterpriseNumber
      is omitted or zero, this is Information Element is not enterprise-
      specific but registered at IANA.

   ieLength:  This parameter specifies the length of the field in
      octets.  A value of 65535 means that the field is encoded as
      variable-length Information Element.  For Information Elements of
      integer and float type, the field length MAY be set to a smaller
      value than the standard length of the abstract data type if the
      rules of reduced size encoding are fulfilled (see [RFC5101],
      Section 6.2).  If not configured by the user, the field length is
      set by the Monitoring Device.

   isFlowKey:  If present, this field is a Flow Key.

   the Destination class and the FileWriter, respectively.  These two
   classes are described in Section 4.4.1 and Section 4.4.2.  If not
   configured by the user, the Exporting Process ID is assigned by the
   Monitoring Device.  The reporting of specific information with
   Options Templates is defined with objects of the Options class.

                       Figure 14: Destination class

   The Destination class shown in Figure 14 contains the configuration
   parameters of one export destination (i.e., Collector) the Exporting
   Process sends IPFIX Messages to.  Some of the parameters are only
   applicable if a specific transport protocol (SCTP, UDP, or TCP) is
   used.  The following parameters apply to all transport protocols:

   exportMemberType:  Configures the export member type that corresponds
      to the ipfixTransportSessionGroupMemberType object in
      [I-D.ietf-ipfix-mib].  The following parameter values are
      specified by the configuration data model:
      *  primary: primary target of the Exporting Process
      *  secondary: secondary target of the Exporting Process used when
         the primary target is not reachable
      *  parallel: parallel exporting to all destinations and files of
         the Exporting Process
      *  loadBalancing: load-balancing between different destinations
         and files of the Exporting Process
      "parallel" is the default value if this parameter is not
      configured.  If one destination or file is configured as "primary"



Muenz, et al.  draft-ietf-ipfix-configuration-model-04.txt     [Page 27]

Internet-Draft    IPFIX/PSAMP Configuration Data Model      October 2009


      target, all other destinations and files must be configured as
      "secondary" targets.  If "parallel" or "loadBalancing" is used,
      the same type must be configured for all destinations and File
      Writers of the Exporting Process.

   ipfixVersion:  Version number of the IPFIX protocol used.  If
      omitted, the default value is 10 (=0x000a) as specified in
      [RFC5101].

   transportProtocol:  One of "sctp", "udp", and "tcp".

   destinationIpAddress, destinationPort:  Destination IP address and
      destination port number to be used. destinationIpAddress is a
      mandatory parameter.  If destinationPort is omitted, standard port
      4739 (IPFIX without TLS and DTLS) or 4740 (IPFIX over TLS or DTLS)
      is used.

   sendBufferSize:  Size of the socket send buffer in bytes.

   rateLimit:  Maximum number of bytes per second the Exporting Process
      may export to the given destination as required by [RFC5476].  The
      number of bytes is calculated from the lengths of the IPFIX
      Messages exported.  If this parameter is not configured, no rate
      limiting is performed for this destination.

   The following parameters are applicable if SCTP is transport
   protocol:

   localIpAddress:  This optional parameter MAY appear multiple times to
      specify the list of eligible local IP addresses of the SCTP
      association [RFC4960].  If omitted, all locally assigned IP
      addresses are used by the SCTP endpoint.

   timedReliability:  Lifetime in milliseconds until an IPFIX Message
      containing Data Sets only is "abandoned" due to the timed
      reliability mechanism of PR-SCTP [RFC3758].  If this parameter is
      set to zero, reliable SCTP transport is used.

   numberOfStreams:  Number of outbound streams requested for SCTP
      associations [RFC4960].  If not configured by the user, this
      parameter is set by the Monitoring Device.

   The following parameters are applicable if UDP is transport protocol:








Muenz, et al.  draft-ietf-ipfix-configuration-model-04.txt     [Page 28]

Internet-Draft    IPFIX/PSAMP Configuration Data Model      October 2009


   sourceIpAddress:  This parameter sets the source IP address.  If this
      parameter is omitted, the address assigned to the outgoing
      interface is used.

   templateRefreshTimeout, optionsTemplateRefreshTimeout,
   templateRefreshPacket, optionsTemplateRefreshPacket:  Template
      refresh parameters when using UDP as transport protocol.
      templateRefreshTimeout and optionsTemplateRefreshTimeout are
      specified in seconds between resendings of (Options) Templates.
      If omitted, the default value of 600 seconds (10 minutes) is used
      [RFC5101]. templateRefreshPacket and optionsTemplateRefreshPacket
      are specified in number of IPFIX Messages.  If omitted, the
      (Options) Templates are only resent after timeout.

   Using the TransportLayerSecurity class, transport layer security is
   enabled and configured for this export destination.  If the transport
   protocol is SCTP or UDP, transport layer security is realized using
   DTLS.  In the case of TCP, TLS is used instead.

4.4.2.  FileWriter Class

                      +-----------------------------+
                      | FileWriter                  |
                      +-----------------------------+
                      | name                        |
                      | exportMemberType = parallel |
                      | ipfixVersion = 10           |

                      +-----------------------------+

                       Figure 15: FileWriter classes

   Instead of exporting IPFIX Messages to remote destinations, the
   Exporting Process can write them to a file as proposed in
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-file].  The FileWriter class contains the
   configuration parameters for writing the IPFIX Messages to a specific
   file:

   exportMemberType:  Same parameter as in the Destination class.  The
      File Writers of an Exporting Process belong to the same Transport
      Session group as any destination configured for the same Exporting
      Process.

   ipfixVersion:  Version number of the IPFIX protocol used.  If
      omitted, the default value is 10 (=0x000a) as specified in
      [RFC5101].

   file:  File name and location specified as URI.

4.4.3.  Options Class

                         +-----------------------+

                         Figure 16: Options class

   The Options class in Figure 16 defines the type of specific
   information to be reported, such as statistics, flow keys, Sampling
   and Filtering parameters etc.  [RFC5101] and [RFC5476] specify
   several types of reporting information which may be exported.  The
   following parameter values are specified by the configuration data
   model:

   meteringStatistics:  Export of Metering Process statistics using the
      Metering Process Statistics Options Template [RFC5101].

   meteringReliability:  Export of Metering Process reliability
      statistics using the Metering Process Reliability Statistics
      Options Template [RFC5101].

   exportingReliability:  Export of Exporting Process reliability
      statistics using the Exporting Process Reliability Statistics
      Options Template [RFC5101].

   flowKeys:  Export of the Flow Key specification using the Flow Keys
      Options Template [RFC5101].

   selectionSequence:  Export of Selection Sequence Report
      Interpretation and Selector Report Interpretation [RFC5476].

   selectionStatistics:  Export of Selection Sequence Statistics Report
      Interpretation [RFC5476].

   accuracy:  Export of Accuracy Report Interpretation [RFC5476].

   reducingRedundancy:  Export of common properties according to
      [RFC5473].

   The Exporting Process MUST choose a template definition according to
   the options type and available options data.



Muenz, et al.  draft-ietf-ipfix-configuration-model-04.txt     [Page 30]

Internet-Draft    IPFIX/PSAMP Configuration Data Model      October 2009


   The optionsTimeout parameter specifies the reporting interval (in
   milliseconds) for periodic export of the option data.  A parameter
   value of zero means that the export of the option data is not
   triggered periodically, but whenever the available option data has
   changed.  This is the typical setting for options types flowKeys,

   Figure 17 shows the CollectingProcess class that contains the
   configuration and state parameters of a Collecting Process.  Objects
   of the Receiver class specify how IPFIX Messages are received from
   remote Exporters.  The Collecting Process can also be configured as a
   File Reader using objects of the FileReader class.

   As state data, the CollectingProcess class contains the list of
   Transport Sessions that terminate at the Collecting Process.  The
   TransportSession class is specified in Section 4.7.

   An CollectingProcess object MAY refer to one or multiple
   ExportingProcess objects configuring Exporting Processes that export
   the received data without modifications to a file or to another
   Collector.

       +--------------------------------------+

                         Figure 18: Receiver class

   The Receiver class contains the configuration parameters of a
   listening socket of the Collecting Process.  Some of the parameters
   are specific to the transport protocol.  The parameters are as
   follows:

   transportProtocol:  One of "sctp", "udp", and "tcp".

   localIpAddress:  Local IP addresses the socket is bound to.  If
      ipAddress is omitted, the socket is bound to all local IP
      addresses.  In the case of SCTP, the local IP addresses correspond
      to the eligible local IP addresses used by the local SCTP endpoint
      [RFC4960].

   localPort:  Local port number.  If omitted, standard port 4739 (IPFIX
      without TLS and DTLS) or 4740 (IPFIX over TLS or DTLS) is used.

   maxAllowedStreams (available if transport protocol is SCTP):  Maximum
      number of allowed inbound streams per SCTP association.  If not
      configured by the user, this parameter is set by the Monitoring
      Device.

   templateLifetime (available if transport protocol is UDP):  Template
      lifetime if UDP is used as transport protocol.  If not configured,
      the default value 1800 is used, which is three times the default
      Template refresh timeout (see Section 4.4) as specified in
      [RFC5101].

   Using the TransportLayerSecurity class, transport layer security
   using DTLS and TLS is enabled and configured for this listening
   socket of the Collecting Process.  If the transport protocol is SCTP
   or UDP, transport layer security is realized using DTLS.  In the case
   of TCP, TLS is used instead.

                  +--------------------------------------+

                  Figure 20: TransportLayerSecurity class

   The TransportLayerSecurity class is used in the Exporting Process's
   Destination class and the Collecting Process's Receiver class to
   enable and configure transport layer security for IPFIX.  Transport
   layer security can be enabled without configuring any additional
   parameters.  In this case, an empty XML element
   <transportLayerSecurity /> appears in the configuration.  If
   transport layer security is enabled, the endpoint must use DTLS
   [RFC4347] if the transport protocol is SCTP or UDP, and TLS [RFC5246]
   if the transport protocol is TCP.

   [RFC5101] mandates strong mutual authentication of Exporting
   Processes and Collecting Process:

      "IPFIX Exporting Processes and IPFIX Collecting Processes are
      identified by the fully qualified domain name of the interface on
      which IPFIX Messages are sent or received, for purposes of X.509



Muenz, et al.  draft-ietf-ipfix-configuration-model-04.txt     [Page 33]

Internet-Draft    IPFIX/PSAMP Configuration Data Model      October 2009


      client and server certificates as in [RFC3280].

      To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks from impostor Exporting or
      Collecting Processes, the acceptance of data from an unauthorized
      Exporting Process, or the export of data to an unauthorized
      Collecting Process, strong mutual authentication via asymmetric
      keys MUST be used for both TLS and DTLS.  Each of the IPFIX
      Exporting and Collecting Processes MUST verify the identity of its
      peer against its authorized certificates, and MUST verify that the
      peer's certificate matches its fully qualified domain name, or, in
      the case of SCTP, the fully qualified domain name of one of its
      endpoints.

      The fully qualified domain name used to identify an IPFIX
      Collecting Process or Exporting Process may be stored either in a
      subjectAltName extension of type dNSName, or in the most specific
      Common Name field of the Subject field of the X.509 certificate.
      If both are present, the subjectAltName extension is given
      preference."

   In order to use transport layer security, appropriate certificates
   and keys have to be previously installed on the Monitoring Devices.
   For security reasons, the configuration data model does not offer the
   possibility to upload any certificates or keys on a Monitoring
   Device.  If transport layer security is enabled on a Monitoring
   Device which does not dispose of appropriate certificates and keys,
   the configuration MUST be rejected with an error.

   The configuration data model allows restricting the authorization of
   remote endpoints to certificates issued by specific certification
   authorities or identifying specific fully qualified domain names for
   authorization.  Furthermore, the configuration data model allows
   restricting the utilization of certificates identifying the local
   endpoint.  This is useful if the Monitoring Device disposes of more
   than one certificate for the given local endpoint.

   The configuration parameters are defined as follows:

   localCertificationAuthorityDN:  This parameter MAY appear one or
      multiple times to restrict the identification of the local
      endpoint during the TLS/DTLS handshake to certificates issued by
      the configured certification authorities.  Each occurrence of this
      parameter contains the distinguished name of one certification
      authority.
      To identify the local endpoint, the Exporting Process or
      Collecting Process MUST use a certificate issued by one of the
      configured certification authority.  Certificates issued by any
      other certification authority MUST NOT be sent to the remote peer



Muenz, et al.  draft-ietf-ipfix-configuration-model-04.txt     [Page 34]

Internet-Draft    IPFIX/PSAMP Configuration Data Model      October 2009


      during TLS/DTLS handshake.  If none of the certificates installed
      on the Monitoring Device fulfills the specified restrictions, the
      configuration MUST be rejected with an error.
      If localCertificationAuthorityDN is not configured, the choice of
      certificates identifying the local endpoint is not restricted with
      respect to the issuing certification authority.

   localSubjectDN, localSubjectFQDN:  Each of these parameters MAY
      appear one or multiple times to restrict the identification of the
      local endpoint during the TLS/DTLS handshake to certificates
      issued for specific subjects or for specific fully qualified
      domain names.  Each occurrence of localSubjectDN contains a
      distinguished name identifying the local endpoint.  Each
      occurrence of localSubjectFQDN contains a fully qualified domain
      name which is assigned to the local endpoint.
      To identify the local endpoint, the Exporting Process or
      Collecting Process MUST use a certificate that contains either one
      of the configured distinguished names in the subject field or at
      least one of the configured fully qualified domain names in a
      dNSName component of the subject alternative extension field or in
      the most specific commonName component of the subject field.  If
      none of the certificates installed on the Monitoring Device
      fulfills the specified restrictions, the configuration MUST be
      rejected with an error.
      If any of the parameters localSubjectDN and localSubjectFQDN is
      configured at the same time as the localCertificationAuthorityDN
      parameter, certificates MUST also fulfill the specified
      restrictions regarding the certification authority.
      If localSubjectDN and localSubjectFQDN are not configured, the
      choice of certificates identifying the local endpoint is not
      restricted with respect to the subject's distinguished name or
      fully qualified domain name.

   remoteCertificationAuthorityDN:  This parameter MAY appear one or
      multiple times to restrict the authentication of remote endpoints
      during the TLS/DTLS handshake to certificates issued by the
      configured certification authorities.  Each occurrence of this
      parameter contains the distinguished name of one certification
      authority.
      To authenticate the remote endpoint, the remote Exporting Process
      or Collecting Process MUST provide a certificate issued by one of
      the configured certification authority.  Certificates issued by
      any other certification authority MUST be rejected during TLS/DTLS
      handshake.
      If the Monitoring Device is not able to validate certificates
      issued by the configured certification authorities (e.g., because
      of missing public keys), the configuration must be rejected with
      an error.

      If remoteCertificationAuthorityDN is not configured, the
      authorization of remote endpoints is not restricted with respect
      to the issuing certification authority of the delivered
      certificate.

   remoteSubjectDN, remoteSubjectFQDN:  Each of these parameters MAY
      appear one or multiple times to restrict the authentication of
      remote endpoints during the TLS/DTLS handshake to certificates
      issued for specific subjects or for specific fully qualified
      domain names.  Each occurrence of remoteSubjectDN contains a
      distinguished name identifying a remote endpoint.  Each occurrence
      of remoteSubjectFQDN contains a fully qualified domain name which
      is assigned to a remote endpoint.
      To authenticate a remote endpoint, the remote Exporting Process or
      Collecting Process MUST provide a certificate that contains either
      one of the configured distinguished names in the subject field or
      at least one of the configured fully qualified domain names in a
      dNSName component of the subject alternative extension field or in
      the most specific commonName component of the subject field.
      Certificates not fulfilling this condition MUST be rejected during
      TLS/DTLS handshake.
      If any of the parameters remoteSubjectDN and remoteSubjectFQDN is
      configured at the same time as the remoteCertificationAuthorityDN
      parameter, certificates MUST also fulfill the specified
      restrictions regarding the certification authority in order to be
      accepted.
      If remoteSubjectDN and remoteSubjectFQDN are not configured, the
      authorization of remote endpoints is not restricted with respect
      to the subject's distinguished name or fully qualified domain name
      of the delivered certificate.

   The TransportSession class contains state data about Transport
   Sessions originating from an Exporting Process or terminating at a
   Collecting Process.  The names and semantics of the state parameters
   correspond to the managed objects in the ipfixTransportSessionTable
   and ipfixTransportSessionStatsTable of the IPFIX MIB module
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-mib].  Hence, if these state parameters are queried
   from the Monitoring Device, the corresponding IPFIX MIB values can be
   returned without any further processing.  The MIB object
   ipfixTransportSessionDeviceMode is not included in the
   TransportSession class because its value can be derived from the
   scope in which a TransportSession object appears: exporting(1) if it
   belongs to an Exporting Process, collecting(2) if it belongs to a
   Collecting Process.

   The state parameter exportMemberType is only available if the

   exportMemberType then contains the value of the MIB object
   ipfixExportMemberType of the ipfixExportTable of the IPFIX MIB
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-mib].

   The TransportSession class is also used for state data of File
   Readers and File Writers.  In this case, the "file" parameter
   specifies the name and location of the file as URI.  To avoid
   ambiguities, the parameters "protocol", "sourceAddress",
   "destinationAddress", "sourcePort", "destinationPort", and
   "sctpAssocId" MUST NOT appear if the parameter "file" is present.
   The parameter "file" MUST NOT appear if at least one of the

   parameters are queried from the Monitoring Device, the corresponding
   IPFIX MIB values can be returned without any further processing.


5.  Adaptation to Device Capabilities

   The configuration data model standardizes a superset of common IPFIX
   and PSAMP configuration parameters.  A typical Monitoring Device
   implementation will not support the entire range of possible
   configurations.  Certain functions may not be supported, such as the
   Collecting Process that does not exist on a Monitoring Device
   conceived as Exporter only.  The configuration of other functions may
   be subject to resource limitations.  For example, the Cache size is
   typically limited according to the available memory on the device.

   YANG [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang] offers several possibilities to restrict
   and adapt a configuration data model.  The current version of YANG
   defines the concepts of "features" and "deviations".

   The feature concept allows the modeler to make proportions of the
   model conditional in a manner that is controlled by the device.
   Devices do not have to support these conditional parts to conform to
   the model.  Those features that are supported by a device must be
   announced in the <hello> message of the NETCONF protocol [RFC4741].

   The configuration data model for IPFIX and PSAMP covers the
   configuration of Exporters, Collectors, and devices that may act as
   both.  As Exporters and Collectors implement different functions, the
   corresponding proportions of the model are conditional on the
   following features:

   exporter:  If this feature is supported, Exporting Processes can be
      configured.

   collector:  If this feature is supported, Collecting Processes can be
      configured.

   Exporters do not necessarily implement any Selection Processes,
   Caches, or even Observation Points in particular cases.  Therefore,
   the corresponding proportions of the model are conditional on the
   following feature:

   meter:  If this feature is supported, Observation Points, Selection
      Processes, and Caches can be configured.

   Additional features refer to different PSAMP Sampling and Filtering
   methods:




Muenz, et al.  draft-ietf-ipfix-configuration-model-04.txt     [Page 39]

Internet-Draft    IPFIX/PSAMP Configuration Data Model      October 2009


   psampSampCountBased:  If this feature is supported, Sampling method
      sampCountBased can be configured.

   psampSampTimeBased:  If this feature is supported, Sampling method
      sampTimeBased can be configured.

   psampSampRandOutOfN:  If this feature is supported, Sampling method
      sampRandOutOfN can be configured.

   psampSampUniProb:  If this feature is supported, Sampling method
      sampUniProb can be configured.

   psampFilterMatch:  If this feature is supported, Filtering method
      filterMatch can be configured.

   psampFilterHash:  If this feature is supported, Filtering method
      filterHash can be configured.

   The following features concern the support of UDP and TCP as
   transport protocols and the support of File Readers and File Writers:

   udpTransport:  If this feature is supported, UDP can be used as
      transport protocol by Exporting Processes and Collecting
      Processes.

   tcpTransport:  If this feature is supported, TCP can be used as
      transport protocol by Exporting Processes and Collecting
      Processes.

   fileReader:  If this feature is supported, Collecting Processes can
      be configured as File Readers.

   fileReader:  If this feature is supported, Exporting Processes can be
      configured as File Writers.

   The deviation concept enables a device to announce deviations from
   the standard model.  Deviations are typically used to specify
   limitations due to resource constraints.  Deviations concern existing
   parameters of the standard model and must not be confused with model
   extensions that are realized with the YANG statement "augment".  Just
   like features, deviations are announced in NETCONF's <hello> message.
   A usage example of deviations is given in Section 7.5.


6.  YANG Module of the IPFIX/PSAMP Configuration Data Model

   The YANG module specification of the configuration data model is
   listed below.  It makes use of common YANG types defined in

   revision 2009-10-23 {
     description "Version of draft-ietf-ipfix-configuration-model-04
       Changes in draft-ietf-ipfix-configuration-model-04:
       - descriptions and references added in various places,
         especially for state parameters
       - enum types cacheMode, exportMemberType, optionsType replaced
         by identities in order to facilitate the addition of new
         values using YANG deviations
       - Selector parameters revised:
         - parameter names now correspond to Information Element
           names
         - single matching value instead of range in filterMatch
           (which is consistent with Selector Report Interpretation)
         - filterHash parameters adapted to PSAMP RFCs
         - sampNonUniProb, sampFlowState, filterRState removed
           (a Selector Report Interpretation does not exist, yet)
       - some must statements replaced by choices, which is easier
         to read
       - orderedDelivery parameter removed, better add a parameter
         for activating per-sctp stream later
       - YANG data type timeticks replaced by uint32 and unit
         milliseconds
       - configuration of fields included in an Options Template
         removed because there is no real use-case
       - observationPointId, selectionSequenceId, and selectorId are
         now state parameters (i.e., not configurable any more)
         because there is no real use-case to configure them
       - meaning of configuration parameters activeTimeout and
         inactiveTimeout clarified
       - several additional must statements enforcing certain
         configuration restrictions
       Changes in draft-ietf-ipfix-configuration-model-03:
       - list of used or received templates now inside transport
         session container because templates are defined per transport

         session
       - transport session: removed 'index', added missing 'protocol'
       - exportingProcessId removed
       - Transport Session state data can be used for File Readers
         and File Writers
       - module name changed
       - Renaming: cacheType => cacheMode,
         Options' type => optionsType,
         Destination's/FileWriter's type => exportMemberType,
         uri => file, optionTemplate => optionsTemplate,
         optionField => optionsField
       - transport layer security parameters added to Destination
         class and Receiver class
       - must statements ensure that Selection Processes and Caches
         process packets of a single Observation Domain (as long as
         Selection Processes are not cascaded)
       - replaced default value of port by description because the
         value differs in the case of DTLS/TLS
       Changes in draft-ietf-ipfix-configuration-model-02:
       - conformance to draft-ietf-netmod-yang-03 and
         draft-ietf-netmod-yang-types-01
       - canonical form
       - observationDomainId is now mandatory parameter
       - usage of YANG features
       - renamed parameter 'idleTimeout' in 'inactiveTimeout'
       - state data: Selector statistics, Cache statistics, Templates,
         Transport Sessions
       - Exporting Process: new structure of destination, fileWriter
       - Collecting Process: new structure of receiver, fileReader
       - more groupings and typedefs
       - options configured per Exporting Process, not per
         destination
       - verified optional parameters, added default values or
         description clause if necessary
       Changes in draft-ietf-ipfix-configuration-model-01:
       - separation of Selectors and Selection Processes as in PSAMP
         documents
       - parameter modifications in filterMatch
       - new rateLimit parameter in destinations of Exporting Process
       - Cache Type 'normal' now called 'timeout'
       Changes in draft-ietf-ipfix-configuration-model-00:
       - Metering Process container replaced by direct reference to
         Selection Process
       - meteringProcessId parameter disappears together with the
         Metering Process container
       - concatenation of Selection Processes realize Selection
         Sequence
       - removal of premature support of

       - more SCTP parameters in SctpReceiver and SctpExport classes
       - sendBufferSize parameter for all *Export classes
       - templateId no longer configuration parameter

       - parameter for eligible local IP addresses for SCTP endpoint
       - all tags names uncapitalized, types names etc. capitalized
       - CacheParameters renamed as Cache
       - description attribute removed
       Changes in -03:
       - Linecard and Interface classes now have direction element
       - sec => s (SI unit)
       - optional description attribute for annotations
       - simplifications in ExportingProcess class
       - new parameters: observationPointId, meteringProcessId,
         selectorId, exportingProcessId (note that devices do not
         have to support the configuration of these parameters)
       - new FileExport class for exporting into a file
       - Reporting class renamed Options Class
       Changes in -02:
       - new structure without next pointers

7.  Examples

   This section shows example configurations conforming to the YANG
   module specified in Section 6.

7.1.  PSAMP Device

   This configuration example contains two Selection Processes
   configured for the same Observation Point.  The first Selection
   Process implements two Selectors: a filter for UDP packets and a



Muenz, et al.  draft-ietf-ipfix-configuration-model-04.txt     [Page 78]

Internet-Draft    IPFIX/PSAMP Configuration Data Model      October 2009


   random sampler.  The second Selection Process implements an ICMP
   filter.  The outputs of both Selection Processes enter the same
   Cache.  The Cache Mode is "immediate" resulting in the creation of a
   PSAMP Packet Report for every selected packet.

   The associated Exporting Process exports to one Collector using PR-
   SCTP and DTLS.  The transport layer security parameters specify that
   the collector must supply a certificate for the fully qualified
   domain name collector.example.net.  Valid certificates from any
   certification authority will be accepted.  As the destination
   transport port is omitted, the standard IPFIX-over-DTLS port 4740 is
   used.  Exporting Process reliability statistics are reported every
   five minutes.

7.2.  IPFIX Device

   This configuration example demonstrates the shared usage of a Cache
   for maintaining Flow Records from two different Observation Points.
   Packets are selected using different Sampling techniques: count-based
   Sampling for the first Observation Point and selection of all packets
   for the second Observation Point.  Note that both Observation Points
   belong to the same Observation Domain, as required.  The Exporting
   Process sends the Flow Records to a primary destination using SCTP.
   A UDP Collector is specified as secondary destination.  Exporting
   Process reliability statistics [RFC5101] are exported periodically
   every minute (60000 milliseconds).  Selection Sequence Report
   Interpretation and Selector Report Interpretation [RFC5476] are
   exported once after configuration of the Selection Processes has been
   made.

7.3.  Export of Flow Records and Packet Reports

   This configuration example demonstrates the combined export of Flow
   Records and Packet Reports for a single Observation Point.  A
   Selection Process (Selection Sequence ID = 1) applies random Sampling
   to the stream of observed packets.  The output is passed to a Cache
   generating Flow Records.  In parallel, the output is passed to a
   second Selection Process (Selection Sequence ID = 2) which discards
   all non-ICMP packets.  A second Cache generates Packet Reports of the
   retained ICMP packets.  The output of both caches is exported to a
   single Collector using SCTP.

   The Observed Packet Stream at the input of the Selection Process
   "ICMP" originates from the Selection Process "Sampling", which thus
   constitutes a pseudo Observation Point.  In order to inform the
   Collector about the cascaded Selection Processes, the Exporting
   Process exports two Selection Sequence Report Interpretations as
   defined in [RFC5476], section 6.5.1, including the following fields:

   Selection Process "Sampling":

     Scope:      selectionSequenceId = 1
     Non-scope:  ingressInterface = 4
                 selectorId = 1


   Selection Process "ICMP":

     Scope:      selectionSequenceId = 2
     Non-scope:  selectionSequenceId = 1
                 selectorId = 2

Internet-Draft    IPFIX/PSAMP Configuration Data Model      October 2009


   One possibility to link the Selection Sequence Report Interpretation
   of Selection Process "Sampling" to the Flow Record generated by the
   Cache named "Flow cache" is to include a field selectionSequenceId =
   1 to each Data Record.  Similarly, the Selection Sequence Report
   Interpretation of Selection Process "ICMP" can be linked to the
   Packet Reports generated by the Cache named "Packet cache" by
   including a field selectionSequenceId = 2 to each Data Record.

   The following modifications lead to a similar but not identical
   configuration of the Monitoring Device:

     ...

   In this case, the random sampler is implemented in two different
   Selection Processes, leading to different sets of selected packets.
   As a consequence, the set of packets accounted in the Flow Cache is
   not identical to the set of packets from which the ICMP Packet
   Reports are generated.

7.5.  Deviations

   Assume that a Monitoring Device does not support the configuration of
   Observation Domain ID and Observation Point ID.  It supports a single
   Observation Domain with ID=1 to which two interfaces can be assigned.
   The Observation Point ID is identical to the ifIndex.  Linecards are
   not installed.

   The following YANG module specifies these deviations.

8.  Security Considerations

   The IPFIX/PSAMP configuration data model does not introduce security
   issues.  Configuration data encoded according to the configuration
   data model may contain sensitive information.  Therefore, if
   configuration data is transmitted, the underlying protocol must apply
   appropriate procedures to guarantee the integrity and confidentiality
   of the data.  Particularly, if the NETCONF protocol is used to
   configure Monitoring Devices, the security considerations of the
   NETCONF protocol apply [RFC4741].


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
