Abstract

   In some IPv6/IPv4 translation scenarios it is necessary for an IPv6
   host to know the IPv6 prefix used by its address family translator.
   In some of the IPv6/IPv4 translation proposals, the prefix is not
   fixed; that is, the prefix is chosen by the network operator.  This
   specification provides several methods to learn the prefix and its
   length.

   AFT:  Address Family Translator.  A device that translates between IP
   address families.

   DNS64:  The function of synthesizing an AAAA response from an A
   record.


2.  Introduction

   Several variations of Address Family Translators (AFT) have been
   proposed for IPv6/IPv6 coexistence.  All of these operate by
   synthesizing DNS AAAA responses for hosts that do not have AAAA
   records -- this is generally called "DNS64" (also "DNS rewriting" or
   "DNS-ALG").  The DNS64 function, when used in conjunction with an
   AFT, allows a IPv6-only host to access IPv4-only hosts.  This access,
   for the most part, is transparent to the IPv6 host -- to much the
   same degree that today's widely-deployed NATs are transparent to IPv4
   hosts.  But, like with today's NATs, there are applications which do
   not work with AFT or do not work with DNS64, and require IPv6 hosts
   to implement additional functionality.

   So far, one application has been identified which requires an IPv6
   host to know the IPv6 prefix used by its address family translator
   (AFT):  A DNSSEC security-aware stub resolver needs to securly obtain
   the IPv6 prefix.  It uses this prefix to generate its own synthesized
   AAAA response from the un-translated A record [Sullivan-email], or to
   validate a synthesized AAAA response by removing the IPv6 prefix
   [Wing-email].


3.  Learning IPv6 Prefix and Length

   Both the IPv6 prefix and the prefix length need to be learned This
   can be done using DNS or DHCP, as described in the following
   sections.

3.1.  Using DNS to Learn IPv6 Prefix and Length

   In order for an IPv6 host to determine if a NAT64 is present on its
   network, it sends a DNS query.  Because a host doesn't always know
   its network's default domain name, the procedure described below
   provides a way for the host to learn it in order to authorize that

   network's address family translator:

   1.  Send a DNS AAAA query for "_aft_prefix", without a domain name.
       If this does not return an IPv6 address it means a address family
       translator is not present and processing MUST stop.

   2.  If validation of the returned IPv6 prefix is necessary, then:

       a.  Send a DNS PTR query for that IPv6 address.  This returns a
           fully-qualified hostname.

       b.  Verify the full-qualified hostname is on the host's
           configured list of authorized translators.

       c.  Send a DNS AAAA query for that hostname.

       d.  Verify the AAAA response matches the IPv6 address obtained in
           step 1.

       e.  Perform DNSSEC validation of the AAAA response.

       f.  Send a DNS TXT query for the fully-qualfied name to learn the
           number of bits of the prefix (e.g., a 48 bit prefix would
           return the string "48").

       g.  Perform DNSSEC validation of the TXT response.

   3.  If validation of this information is not necessary, then:

       a.  Send a DNS TXT query for "_aft_prefix", without the domain
           name, to learn the number of bits of the prefix.

      Note:  The DNS server being queried is the DNS64.  The DNS64
      performs the AAAA synthesis function, which means the DNS64 is
      already aware of the prefix of the address family translator and
      the prefix length.  Thus, is it already capable of returning
      information about the network's AFT.

      Discussion:  without a domain name, it is unavoidable that root
      nameservers will see this query.  Need to think about ways to
      reduce the effect of those queries (e.g., make them authoritative
      and return all 0's which will get cached).

3.2.  Using DHCP to Learn IPv6 Prefix and Length

   A new DHCP option, OPTION_AFT_PREFIX, is defined.  It contains the
   IPv6 prefix and its length.

                        Figure 1: OPTION_AFT_PREFIX

   In order to conserve space, it is RECOMMENDED that only the
   significant bits of the IPv6 prefix be sent in the DHCP option.

   If the host implements a security-aware DNSSEC validator, it must
   validate and authorize that translator.  To do this, it issues a
   ipv6.arpa PTR query on the IPv6 address learned via DHCPv6.  This
   returns a name.  The host then issues a AAAA query using that name,
   and DNSSEC validates the response.  If the query validates, and the
   AAAA response contains an IPv6 address that matches the AFT-PREFIX
   learned from DHCPv6, and the host's administrator has authorized use
   of that AFT translator name, DNSSEC can use that prefix.  Details of
   DNSSEC operation in conjunction with AFT are in [draft to be written
   providing DNSSEC details].


4.  Security Considerations

   After learning the IPv6 prefix of its translator by following the
   procedures in this specification, the IPv6 host will utilize this
   information for subsequent actions (e.g., sending a packet to it, or
   using that information to synthesize DNS records or to perform DNSSEC
   validation).  If an attacker provides a fraudulent IPv6 to the IPv6
   host, the attacker can become on-path for traffic to/from that IPv6

   host and preform passive or active eavesdropping or traffic analysis.
   To protect against this attack, it is RECOMMENDED that IPv6 hosts be
   configured with the names of authorized translators and RECOMMENDED
   that IPv6 hosts uses DNSSEC to validate that name matches the IPv6
   prefix learned via DNS or DHCPv6.


5.  IANA Considerations

   A new DHCPv6 option, OPTION_AFT_PREFIX, needs to be assigned by IANA.

   The name "_aft_translator" should be reserved by IANA for this
   purpose.
