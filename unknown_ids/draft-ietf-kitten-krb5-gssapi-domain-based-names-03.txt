1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Domain-Based Names for the Kerberos V GSS-API Mechanism

   In accordance with [I-D.ietf-kitten-gssapi-domain-based-names] this
   document provides the mechanism-specific details needed to implement
   GSS-API [RFC2743] domain-based service names with the Kerberos V GSS-
   API mechanism [RFC4121].

   GSS_C_NT_DOMAINBASED_SERVICE name SHOULD be mapped to Kerberos V
   principal names as follows:
   o  the <service> name becomes the first (0th) component of the
      Kerberos V principal name;
   o  the <hostname> becomes the second component of the Kerberos V
      principal name;
   o  the <domain> name becomes the third component of the Kerberos V
      principal name;
   o  the realm of the resulting principal name is that which
      corresponds to the domain name, treated as a hostname.

   The same name canonicalization considerations and methods as used
   elsewhere in the Kerberos V GSS-API mechanism [RFC4121] and Kerberos
   V [RFC4120] in general apply here.

   Implementations SHOULD use a Kerberos V name-type of NT-SRV-HST-
   DOMAIN (integral value to be assigned, possibly after WGLC?) but MAY
   use NT-UNKNOWN instead.


3.  Examples

   o  The domain based name, of generic form,
      "ldap@Example.TLD@ds1.Example.TLD" may map to a Kerberos V
      principal name like: "ldap/ds1.example.tld/
      example.tld@EXAMPLE.TLD"
   o  The domain based name, of generic form,
      "kadmin@Example.TLD@kdc1.Example.TLD" may map to a Kerberos V
      principal name like: "kadmin/kdc1.example.tld/
      example.tld@EXAMPLE.TLD"


4.  Security Considerations
