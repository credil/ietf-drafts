Internet-Draft                webm datagram                November 2010


1.  Introduction

   When transporting audio / video data between participants on the
   current Internet, there are a number of obstacles to be faced.

   Among them are NAT boxes, firewalls, connection interruptions, the
   availability of multiple paths between participants, and capacity
   issues.

   This memo describes a combination of existing protocols that can be
   used to achieve a seamless datagram transport service across this
   very heterogenous environment.

   An overview of the effort of which this is a part can be found in the
   overview document, [overview].


2.  Terminology

   This draft uses a couple of commonly used terms in quite specific
   ways.  The reader is advised to study these definitions carefully.

   (TODO: Agree on terminology to use)

   Session  An association with two endpoints, between which datagrams
      flow.

   Datagram  A sequence of octets, of a given length.  In this
      specification, a datagram does not carry addressing information.

   Channel  One means of transporting a datagram over a session.  A
      session may have multiple channels at any time.

   Endpoint  One end of a session.  This document does not distinguish
      between an initiator and a responder endpoint.

   Control channel  A means of communication between the endpoints of a
      session that does not require a transport to be active.
      Typically, authentication, authorization and negotiation is
      carried out over the control channel.  The specification of the
      control channel is out of scope for this specification.


3.  Service model

   The basic model presented is a datagram model.  On top of this one
   can layer various services, such as pseudoTCP (REF), RTP[RFC3550] or
   any other higher layer protocol that is capable of running across a

   datagram service.

   The addressing model departs from the traditional Internet model in
   that end point addresses are not used for endpoint identification,
   only for channel establisment; instead, an initial packet exchange,
   using ICE [RFC5245], is used to bind a channel to a prenegotiated
   session.

   The datagram service is not completely transparent; in particular, it
   is not possible to carry a datagram where the two highest bits of the
   first octet are zero and octet 5 to 8 contain the value 0x2112A442,
   since these datagrams are reserved for use of the STUN protocol (RFC
   5389 section 6).


4.  Channel types

4.1.  UDP channel

   An UDP channel is negotiated using ICE.  Each datagram is simply
   carried as the content of an UDP packet.

4.2.  TCP channel

   A TCP channel consists of a TCP connection, over which are sent
   datagrams packaged according to (REF).  The binding of a TCP channel
   is done by executing an ICE negotiation over the first few packets
   passed across the TCP channel.

4.3.  TLS channel

   A TLS channel consists of a standard TLS negotiation, followed by
   passing datagrams over the TLS record layer; the length fields of
   (REF) are not used.  A TLS channel is bound to its session by <insert
   process description>.

4.4.  DTLS channel

   A DTLS channel is created by executing a DTLS connection negotiation,
   followed by datagram exchange, where the datagrams are protected by
   DTLS mechanisms.  The DTLS channel is bound to its session by <insert
   process>.

4.5.  Channels with relay

   If there is no possibility of setting up a direct connection, a relay
   must be used.  The specification from TURN [RFC5766]is used.

5.  Channel setup, teardown and usage

   The service model envisioned here is that all datagrams arriving on a
   session are considered equally valid.  The session gives no
   guarantees against duplication, loss or reordering; such concerns are
   left to the higher protocol layers.

   The expected normal usage is that two endpoints will exchange
   addressing information that can be used for a series of potential
   channels, that the endpoints will probe for working channels using
   ICE (RFC 5245), and use the "best" candidate, while using the STUN
   probing facilities to keep some number of "second best" candidates
   alive if the "best" candidate stops working.

   A data-sending endpoint may unilaterally decide to start or stop
   using an established channel at any time.  No negotiation is
   necessary.

   A receiving endpoint will learn that a channel has been removed by
   not seeing any more STUN keepalive messages on that channel within
   <timeout>.

   A session is considered closed when all channels that have been
   successfully established have timed out.


6.  An URI scheme for datagram channels

   This URI scheme is mainly included in order to make it easy for APIs
   that normally use URIs as what they use to refer to objects.

   The DGSESSION URI scheme specifies the information required for a
   session; it consists of two parts:

   o  An absolute reference, which includes the user name and password
      used to establish the connection.

   o  A series of addressing hints, which include the data necessary to
      establish a channel.

   <TODO: Fill out an URI registration template for the scheme>

   Example:

   dgsession:username:password?ipv4:12.34.56:udp:12345&
   ipv6:2002::dead:beef:tcp:80&ipv4:12.34.56.78:tls:443

   The sequence of addressing hints is an indication of the preference

   of the URL constructor for the sequence in which to try these
   candidates; the most preferred address is the one to the left.

   Note that a DGSESSION URI is a capability; anyone with the URI will
   be able to connect to the entity.  They should therefore be handled
   in the same way as (short-term) passwords, and never passed in the
   clear.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the URI scheme from section Paragraph 1.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.


8.  Security Considerations

   As with all layered protocols, it is a matter for the application to
   decide which level security should be provided at.  For instance, an
   RTP session protected using SRTP <ref> can be considered to not need
   any further safeguards against interception, modification or replay,
   so can be passed "in the clear" across any channel type here.  For
   data without such protection, adequate measures need to be taken; in
   particular, it is trivially easy for someone with the ability to
   snoop and insert packets to insert fake packets into an established
   UDP channel.

   The main defense against denial-of-service attacks is the fact that
   the ICE mechanisms were designed for low cost refusal of unauthorized
   connections.
