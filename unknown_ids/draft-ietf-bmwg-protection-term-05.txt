Abstract 
  This document provides common terminology and metrics for benchmarking 
  the performance of sub-IP layer protection mechanisms. The performance 
  benchmarks are measured at the IP-Layer, avoiding dependence on 
  specific sub-IP protection mechanisms. The benchmarks and terminology 
  can be applied in methodology documents for different sub-IP layer 
  protection mechanisms such as Automatic Protection Switching (APS), 
  Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), Stateful High Availability 
  (HA), and Multi-Protocol Label Switching Fast Reroute (MPLS-FRR).

Internet-Draft         Benchmarking Terminology for      November 2008 
                          Protection Performance  

1. Introduction 

   The IP network layer provides route convergence to protect data  
   traffic against planned and unplanned failures in the internet. Fast 
   convergence times are critical to maintain reliable network 
   connectivity and performance.  Convergence Events [7] are recognized 
   at the IP Layer so that Route Convergence [7] occurs.  Technologies 
   that function at sub-IP layers can be enabled to provide further 
   protection of IP traffic by providing the failure recovery at the 
   sub-IP layers so that the outage is not observed at the IP-layer.  
   Such sub-IP protection technologies include, but are not limited to, 
   High Availability (HA) stateful failover, Virtual Router Redundancy 
   Protocol (VRRP) [11], Automatic Link Protection (APS) for SONET/SDH, 
   Resilient Packet Ring (RPR) for Ethernet, and Fast Reroute for 
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS-FRR) [8].   

   1.1 Scope         
   Benchmarking terminology was defined for IP-layer convergence in 
   [7].  Different terminology and methodologies specific to 
   benchmarking sub-IP layer protection mechanisms are required.  The 
   metrics for benchmarking the performance of sub-IP protection 
   mechanisms are measured at the IP layer, so that the results are 
   always measured in reference to IP and independent of the specific 
   protection mechanism being used. The purpose of this document is 
   to provide a single terminology for benchmarking sub-IP protection 
   mechanisms.  

   A common terminology for Sub-IP layer protection mechanism 
   benchmarking enables different implementations of a protection 
   mechanism to be benchmarked and evaluated.  In addition, 
   implementations of different protection mechanisms can be 
   benchmarked and evaluated.  It is intended that there can exist 
   unique methodology documents for each sub-IP protection mechanism
   based upon this common terminology document.  The terminology
   can be aplied to methodologies that benchmark sub-IP protection 
   mechanism performance with a single stream of traffic or 
   multiple streams of traffic.  The traffic flow may be 
   uni-directional or bi-directional as to be indicated in the
   methodology. 
     
   1.2 General Model    
   The sequence of events to benchmark the performance of Sub-IP 
   Protection Mechanisms is as follows:
   
   1. Failover Event - Primary Path fails
   2. Failure Detection-  Failover Event is detected
   3. Failover - Backup Path becomes the Working Path due to Failover 
                 Event
   4. Restoration - Primary Path recovers from a Failover Event 
   5. Reversion (optional) - Primary Path becomes the Working Path
   
   These terms are further defined in this document.

Internet-Draft         Benchmarking Terminology for      November 2008 
                          Protection Performance  
  
   Figures 1 through 5 show models that MAY be used when benchmarking 
   Sub-IP Protection mechanisms, which MUST use a Protection Switching 
   System that consists of a minimum of two Protection-Switching Nodes, 
   an Ingress Node known as the Headend Node and an Egress Node known 
   as the Merge Node.  The Protection Switching System MUST include 
   either a Primary Path and Backup Path, as shown in Figures 1 through 
   4, or a Primary Node and Standby Node, as shown in Figure 5.  A 
   Protection Switching System may provide link protection, node
   protection, path protection, local link protection, and high 
   availability, as shown in Figures 1 through 5 respectively.  A 
   Failover Event occurs along the Primary Path or at the Primary Node.  
   The Working Path is the Primary Path prior to the Failover Event and 
   the Backup Path after the Failover Event.  A Tester is set outside 
   the two paths or nodes as it sends and receives IP traffic along the 
   Working Path.  The tester MUST record the IP packet sequence numbers, 
   departure time, and arrival time so that the metrics of Failover 
   Time, Additive Latency, Packet Reordering, Duplicate Packets, and 
   Reversion Time can be measured.  The Tester may be a single device 
   or a test system.  If Reversion is supported then the Working Path is 
   the Primary Path after Restoration (Failure Recovery) of the Primary 
   Path.  

   Link Protection, as shown in Figure 1, provides protection when a 
   Failover Event occurs on the link between two nodes along the Primary 
   Path.  Node Protection, as shown in Figure 2, provides protection 
   when a Failover Event occurs at a Node along the Primary Path.  
   Path Protection, as shown in Figure 3, provides protection for link 
   or node failures for multiple hops along the Primary Path.  Local 
   Link Protection, as shown in Figure 4, provides Sub-IP Protection of 
   a link between two nodes, without a Backup Node.  An example of such 
   a Sub-IP Protection mechanism is SONET APS.  High Availability 
   Protection, as shown in Figure 5, provides protection of a Primary 
   Node with a redundant Standby Node.  State Control is provided 
   between the Primary and Standby Nodes.  Failure of the Primary Node 
   is detected at the Sub-IP layer to force traffic to switch to the 
   Standby Node, which has state maintained for zero or minimal packet
   loss.

3. Test Considerations 
   
  3.1. Paths  

    3.1.1 Path 
      
    Definition: 
       A unidirectional sequence of nodes, <R1, ..., Rn>, and links 
      <L12,... L(n-1)n> with the following properties: 
       
       a. R1 is the ingress node and forwards IP packets, which input 
       into DUT/SUT, to R2 as sub-IP frames over link L12. 
       
       b. Ri is a node which forwards data frames to R[i+1] over Link 
       Li[i+1] for all i, 1<i<n, based on information in the sub-IP 
       layer. 
       
       c. Rn is the egress node and it outputs sub-IP frames from 
       DUT/SUT as IP packets. 
                  
    Discussion: 
       The path is defined in the sub-IP layer in this document, unlike 
       an IP path in RFC 2026 [1].   One path may be regarded as being 
       equivalent to one IP link between two IP nodes, i.e., R1 and Rn.  
       The two IP nodes may have multiple paths for protection.  A 
       packet will travel on only one path between the nodes.  Packets 
       belonging to a microflow [9] will traverse one or more paths.  
       The path is unidirectional.  For example, the link between R1 
       and R2 in the direction from R1 to R2 is L12.  For traffic 
       flowing in the reverse direction from R2 to R1, the link is L21.
       Example paths are the SONET/SDH path and the label switched path 
       for MPLS. 
            
    Measurement units: 
       n/a 
      
    Issues: 
       "A bidirectional path", which transmits traffic in both 
       directions along the same nodes, consists of two unidirectional 
       paths.  Therefore, the two unidirectional paths belonging to 
       "one bidirectional path" will be treated independently when 
       benchmarking for "a bidirectional path".

    Definition: 
       The path that the DUT/SUT is currently using to forward 
       packets. 
      
    Discussion: 
       A Primary Path is the Working Path before occurrence of a  
       Failover Event.  A Backup Path SHALL become the Working Path 
       after a Failover Event.

       A Primary Path that is protected with a Backup Path.         
      
       Discussion: 
       A Protected Primary Path MUST include at least one Protection 
       Switching Node.

       Definition: 
       A path that exists to carry data traffic only if a Failover  
       Event occurs on a Primary Path. 
      
       Discussion: 
       The Backup Path SHALL become the Working Path upon a Failover
       Event.  A Path MAY have one or more Backup Paths.  A Backup 
       Path MAY protect one or more Primary Paths.  There are various 
       types of Backup Paths: 

          a. dedicated recovery Backup Path (1+1), which has 100% 
          redundancy for a specific ordinary path, 

          b. shared Backup Path (1:N), which is dedicated to the 
          protection for more than one specific Primary Path 

          c. associated shared Backup Path (M:N) for which a specific 
          set of Backup Paths protects a specific set of more than one 
          Primary Path. 
 
       A Backup Path may be signaled or unsignaled.  The Backup Path 
       MUST be created prior to the Failover Event.

         Definition: 
         A node capable of Failover along the Primary Path that is 
         also the ingress node for the Backup Path to protect another 
         node or link.

         Discussion: 
         Any node along the Primary Path from the ingress node to 
         the penultimate egress node MAY be a PLR.  The PLR MAY use 
         a single Backup Path for protecting one or more Primary 
         Paths.  There can be multiple PLRs along a Primary Path. 
         The PLR MUST be an ingress to a Backup Path.  The PLR can 
         be any node along the Primary Path except the egress node 
         of the Primary Path.  The PLR MAY simultaneously be a 
         Headend Node when it is serving the role as ingress to 
         the Primary Path and the Backup Path.  If the PLR is 
         also the Headend Node, then the Backup Path is a Disjoint 
         Path from the ingress to the Merge Node.

         SRLG is a set of links which share a physical resource. 
         
         Discussion: 
         SRLG is considered the set of links to be avoided when 
         the primary and secondary paths are considered disjoint.

        Discussion: 
        Redundant Node Protection is provided by Protection
        Switching Systems such as VRRP and HA.  The protection
        mechanisms occur at Sub-IP layers to switch traffic from
        a Primary Node to Backup Node upon a Failover Event at
        the Primary Node.  Traffic continues to traverse the 
        Primary Path through the Standby Node.  The failover MAY 
        be stateful, in which the state information MAY be 
        exchanged in-band or over an out-of-band state control 
        interface.  The Standby Node MAY be active or passive.

                          Protection Performance    
      
       Discussion: 
       Failover Events include, but are not limited to, link failure  
       and router failure.  Routing changes are considered Convergence  
       Events [7] and are not Failover Events.  This restricts  
       Failover Events to sub-IP layers. Failover may be at the PLR or 
       at the ingress. If the failover is at the ingress it is 
       generally on a disjoint path from the ingress to egress.  
            
       Failover Events may results from failures such as link failure 
       or router failure.  The change in path after Failover MAY have
       a Backup Span of one or more nodes.  Failover Events are 
       distinguished from routing changes and Convergence Events [7] 
       by the detection of the failure and subsequent protection 
       switching at a sub-IP layer.  Failover occurs at a Point of 
       Local Repair (PLR) or Primary Node.

       Definition: 
       The process to identify at a sub-IP layer a Failover Event 
       at a Primary Node or along the Primary Path.   
      
       Discussion: 
       Failure Detection occurs at the Primary Node or ingress node 
       of the Primary  Path.  Failure Detection occurs via a sub-IP 
       mechanism such as detection of a link down event or timeout for
       receipt of a control packet. A failure may be completely 
       isolated. A failure may affect a set of links which share a 
       single SRLG (e.g. port with many sub-interfaces). A failure may 
       affect multiple links that are not part of SRLG.

     3.3.4.  Failover 

        Definition: 
        The process to switch data traffic from the protected Primary 
        Path to the Backup Path upon Failure Detection of a Failover 
        Event. 
         
        Discussion: 
        Failover to a Backup Path provides Link Protection, Node 
        Protection, or Path Protection.  Failover is complete when 
        Packet Loss [7], Out-of-order Packets [4], and Duplicate 
        Packets [4] are no longer observed.  Forwarding Delay [4]
        may continue to be observed.

        Definition: 
        The state of failover recovery in which the Primary Path 
        has recovered from a Failover Event, but is not yet 
        forwarding packets because the Backup Path remains the 
        Working Path. 
      
        Discussion: 
        Restoration MUST occur while the Backup Path is the  
        Working Path.  The Backup Path is maintained as the  
        Working Path during Restoration.  Restoration produces 
        a Primary Path that is recovered from failure, but is 
        not yet forwarding traffic.  Traffic is still being 
        forwarded by the Backup Path functioning as the Working 
        Path.

     3.3.6.  Reversion 

        Definition: 
        The state of failover recovery in which the Primary Path has
        become the Working Path so that it is forwarding packets. 
      
        Discussion: 
        Protection Switching Systems may or may not support Reversion. 
        Reversion, if supported, MUST occur after Restoration.  
        Packet forwarding on the Primary Path resulting from Reversion
        may occur either fully or partially over the Primary Path.  A 
        potential problem with Reversion is the discontinuity in end to 
        end delay when the Forwarding Delays [4] along the Primary Path 
        and Backup Path are different, possibly causing Out of Order 
        Packets [4], Duplicate Packets [4], and increased Jitter [4].

        Definition:  
        A redundant node to a Primary Node that forwards traffic along
        the Primary Path upon Failure Detection of the Primary Node.
           
        Discussion:          
        The Standby Node MUST be used for Protection Switching 
        Systems that provide Redundant Node Protection, such as VRRP 
        and HA.  The Standby Node MUST provide protection along the 
        same Primary Path.  If the failover is to a Disjoint Path then 
        it is a Backup Node.  The Standby Node MAY be configured 
        for 1:1 or N:1 protection.  

        The communication between the Primary Node and Standby Node 
        MAY be in-band or across an out-of-band State Control 
        interface.  The Standby Node MAY be geographically dispersed 
        from the Primary Node.  When geographically dispersed, the 
        number of hops of separation may increase failover time.

        The Standby Node MAY be passive or active.  The Passive Standby 
        Node is not offered traffic and does not forward traffic until 
        Failure Detection of the Primary Node.  Upon Failure Detection 
        of the Primary Node, traffic offered to the Primary Node is 
        instead offered to the Passive Standby Node.  The Active 
        Standby Node is offered traffic and forwards traffic along the 
        Primary Path while the Primary Node is also active.  Upon 
        Failure Detection of the Primary Node, traffic offered to the 
        Primary Node is switched to the Active Standby Node.

      Definition: 
      The method to calculate Failover Time (or Reversion Time) using a 
      time scale on the Tester to measure the interval of Failover 
      Packet Loss.
 
      Discussion: 
      The Tester MUST provide statistics which show the duration of 
      failure on a time scale based on occurrence of packet loss on 
      a time scale.  This is indicated by the duration of non-zero 
      packet loss.  The TBLM includes failure detection time and 
      time for data traffic to begin traversing the Backup Path.  
      Failover Time and Reversion Time are calculated using the 
      TBLM as shown in Equation 2:

      (Equation 2)
          (Equation 2a)
          TBLM Failover Time = Time(Failover) - Time(Failover Event)

      Discussion: 
      PLBM includes failure detection time and time for data traffic to

      (Equation 3)
           (Equation 3a) 
           PLBM Failover Time = 
              Number of packets lost / 
                       (Offered Load rate * 1000) 

           (Equation 3b)

      Definition:
      The method to calculate Failover Time (or Reversion Time)
      using a time scale to quantify the interval between
      unimpaired packets arriving in the test stream.

      Discussion:
      The purpose of this method is to quantify the duration of
      failure or reversion on a time scale based on the 
      observation of unimpaired packets,  The TBM is calculated 
      from Equation 2 with the values obtained from the timestamp 
      in the packet payload, rather than from the Tester clock as 
      is used for the values when using the TBLM.

      Unimpaired packets are normal packets that are not lost, 
      reordered, or duplicated.  A reordered packet is defined in

      a sequence number in the payload, where the sequence number equals 
      the next expected number for an unimpaired packet.  A sequence gap
      or sequence reversal indicates impaired packets. 

      For calculating Failover Time, the TBM includes failure 
      detection time and time for data traffic to begin traversing the 
      Backup Path.  For calculating Reversion Time, the TBM includes 
      Reversion Time and time for data traffic to begin traversing the 
      Primary Path.
