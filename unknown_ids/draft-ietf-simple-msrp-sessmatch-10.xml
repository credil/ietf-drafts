			This document defines an extension, sessmatch, for the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP)
			session matching procedure of MSRP entities. The extension extends the applicability of MSRP 
			communication to network scenarios where Application Layer Gateway (ALG) functions modify the Session
			Description Protocol (SDP) MSRP address information.

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
		<t>
			The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) <xref target="RFC4975" pageno="false" format="default" /> is designed 
			to use MSRP relays <xref target="RFC4976" pageno="false" format="default" /> as a means for Network Address 
			Translation (NAT) traversal and policy enforcement.
		</t>       
		<t>     
			However, many Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <xref target="RFC3261" pageno="false" format="default" /> 
			networks, in which MSRP usage is emerging, also contain SIP Application Layer Gateways (ALGs), which 
			anchor and controls media, perform tasks such as NAT traversal, performance monitoring, lawful intercept, 
			address domain bridging, interconnect Service Layer Agreement (SLA) policy enforcement, etc. An example is the 
			Interconnect Border Control Function (IBCF) <xref target="3GPP.23.228" pageno="false" format="default" /> defined 
			by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), which controls a media relay that handles all types of SIP 
			session media (voice, video, MSRP, etc).
		</t>
		<t>
			MSRP, as defined in RFC 4975 <xref target="RFC4975" pageno="false" format="default" /> and RFC 4976 <xref 
			target="RFC4976" pageno="false" format="default" />, does not work when an MSRP entities communicate with 
			such ALGs, unless the ALGs implement MSRP Back-To-Back User Agent (B2BUA) functionality. The reason is that 
			entities use the MSRP URI comparison <xref target="RFC4975" pageno="false" format="default" /> procedure in 
			order to match an MSRP message to an MSRP session. That requires consistency between the address information 
			in the MSRP messages and the address information carried in the SDP a=path attribute. The matching will fail 
			if ALGs modify the address information of the SDP a=path attribute, but do not implement MSRP B2BUA functionality 
			and perform the corresponding modification in the associated MSRP messages. However, few ALGs implement MSRP B2BUA 
			functionality, due to complexity and poor scalability.
		</t>
		<t>
			This specification defines an MSRP extension, sessmatch, that allows MSRP entities to communicate
			with ALGs that do not implement MSRP B2BUA functionality. MSRP entities that support the sessmatch
			use a different mechanism for matching an MSRP message with an MSRP session, called session matching.
			Instead of using the MSRP URI comparison procedure defined in RFC 4975, only the MSRP session-id part 
			is used for the session matching by entities that support the sessmatch extension. 
		</t>
		<t>
			In case TLS with name based authentication is used, ALGs need to implement MSRP B2BUA functionality 
			also when communicating with MSRP entities that support the sessmatch extension, in order to prevent the MSRP 
			communication from failing due to a certificate mismatch.
		</t>
		<t>
			The sessmatch extension is backward compatible. In the absence of ALGs, MSRP entities that do not implement
			the sessmatch extension can interoperate with entities that do implement it. The reason is that the
			matching of an MSRP message to an ongoing session will not fail. MSRP entities that do not implement 
			the sessmatch extension, and communicate with ALGs that do not implement MSRP B2BUA functionality, can 
			normally not establish MSRP sessions, since the session matching will fail in case the address 
			information of the SDP a=path attribute has been modified by the ALGs.

    <section title="Conventions" toc="default">
		<t>
			The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", 
			and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119" 
			pageno="false" format="default" />.
		</t>
		<t>
			In this specification the terminology "fingerprint based TLS authentication" and "name based TLS authentication" 
			are used to refer to the two cases where:
		</t>
		<t>
			1.	An endpoint use a self-signed TLS certificate and sends a certificate fingerprint in SDP (fingerprint 
			based TLS authentication).
		</t>
		<t>
			2.	An endpoint use a certificate from a well known certificate authority and the other endpoint matches 
			the hostname in the received TLS communication SubjectAltName parameter towards the hostname received in the 
			MSRP URI in SDP (name based TLS authentication).
		</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Applicability statement" toc="default">
		<t>
			This document defines an MSRP extension, sessmatch. Support of the extension is optional. MSRP entities
			can implement the extension in order to allow MSRP communication in networks where ALGs that
			might modify the address information of the SDP a=path attribute, but do not implement MSRP B2BUA functionality,
			are present.

    <section title="Sessmatch mechanism" toc="default">
		<section title="General" toc="default">
			<t>
				This section defines how an MSRP entity that supports the sessmatch extension performs session matching, 
				i.e. matches an incoming MSRP message to an MSRP session.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Session matching" toc="default">
			<t>
				The difference between the session matching mechanism in RFC 4975, and the one defined in 
				this specification for the sessmatch extension, is that while the mechanism in RFC 4975 uses the 
				MSRP URI comparison rules for session matching, the sessmatch extension only uses the session-id 
				part of the MSRP URI.
			</t>
			<t>
				When an MSRP entity that receives the first MSRP request for an MSRP session, the To-Path header 
				field of the request should contain a URI with a session-id part that was provided in 
				the SDP associated with the MSRP session. The entity that accepted the connection looks up the 
				session-id part of the MSRP URI in the received requests, in order to determine which session 
				it matches. The session-id part is compared as case sensitive. If a match exists, the entity MUST 
				assume that the host that formed the connection is the host to which this URI was given. If no 
				match exists, the entity MUST reject the request with a 481 response. The entity MUST also check to 
				make sure the session is not already in use on another connection. If the session is already in 
				use, it MUST reject the request with a 506 response.			
			</t>
			<t>
				NOTE: As the sessmatch extension, in a peer to peer session, is backward compatible with the RFC 4975 
				mechanism, the SIMPLE WG did not see a need to define a SIP option-tag associated with the sessmatch 
				extension. In case the session path contains an intermediary that modifies the SDP MSRP routing 
				information, MSRP session establishments that contain RFC 4975 entities will fail. However, that is 
				the case even without the sessmatch extension. Also, an intermediary will normally make a decision 
				whether to insert itself in the session path when it receives the SDP offer. However, it will not be 
				aware about whether the MSRP endpoint acting as SDP answerer supports the sessmatch extension until it 
				receives the SDP answer.

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="sec-security" toc="default">		
		<section title="MSRP URI as shared secret" anchor="sec-security-secret" toc="default">
			<t>
				An MSRP entity that does not support the sessmatch extension uses the complete 
				MSRP URI (scheme, authority, transport, session-id) as a shared secret in order to 
				determine that an incoming transport connection originates from the intended peer device. 
				The shared secret needs to be hard to guess, but in reality only the session-id 
				part with it's minimum 80 bit of randomness is hard to guess. Using only the 
				MSRP URI session-id part as shared secret is therefore roughly as good as using the 
				complete URI.		
			</t>
		</section>
	
		<section title="Uniqueness of the session-id" anchor="sec-security-unique" toc="default">
			<t>
				The value of the MSRP URI session-id part only needs to be unique within the scope 
				of the MSRP entity that created it, so in order to make the session-id unique there 
				is no need to scope its namespace by the MSRP URI authority part.
			</t>
		</section>

		<section title="Man in the middle" anchor="sec-security-mitm" toc="default">
			<t>
				A man-in-the-middle (MiTM) that wants to insert itself in the MSRP communication path, in
				order to modify unprotected MSRP messages, needs to implement MSRP B2BUA functionality. 
				If the MiTM communicates with MSRP entities that support the sessmatch extension, it 
				does not need to modify the To-Path and From-Path header fields in the MSRP messages, 
				which is the case if it communicates with an MSRP entity that do not support the 
				extension. In both cases, however, the MiTM needs to terminate the TCP/TLS connection 
				used for the MSRP communication.
			</t>
			<t>
				The sessmatch extension makes it easier for a MiTM to monitor and record unprotected MSRP
				communication, as it allows the MiTM to anchor the MSRP communication even if it does not 
				implement MSRP B2BUA functionality. 
			</t>
			<t>
				The sessmatch extension does not make it easier for a MiTM to insert itself in the 
				SIP/SDP signaling path, neither does it make it easier for a MiTM to forward MSRP 
				messages towards malicious MSRP entities (as it does not require the MiTM to anchor 
				the MSRP communication).
			</t>
		</section>
		
		<section title="TLS" anchor="sec-security-tls" toc="default">
			<t>
				This specification does not in any way modify TLS security procedures as such. The sessmatch 
				extension allows the usage of ALGs that do not implement MSRP B2BUA functionality in MSRP 
				communications, unless TLS with name based authentication is used, and unless MSRP relays are 
				used. In such cases ALGs need to implement MSRP B2BUA functionality, to prevent the MSRP 
				communication from failing. That applies to MSRP in general, and is not specific to the 
				extension defined in this specification.
			</t>			
			<t>
				In case TLS with fingerprint based authentication is used, the sessmatch extension allows 
				usage of ALGs that modify the address information of the SDP a=path attribute, but no not 
				implement MSRP B2BUA functionality, to communicate with MSRP entities. In order to use 
				fingerprint authentication, the SDP that carries the fingerprint information needs to be
				integrity protected. In case an ALG needs to be able to modify SDP information, however, it 
				will not be possible to provide full end-to-end SDP integrity protection of the SDP. Integrity 
				protection can still be provided between MSRP entities and ALGs, however.
