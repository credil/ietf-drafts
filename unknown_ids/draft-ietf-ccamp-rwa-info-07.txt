Abstract

   This document provides a model of information needed by the routing
   and wavelength assignment (RWA) process in wavelength switched
   optical networks (WSONs).  The purpose of the information described
   in this model is to facilitate constrained lightpath computation in
   WSONs. This model takes into account compatibility constraints
   between WSON signal attributes and network elements but does not
   include constraints due to optical impairments. Aspects of this
   information that may be of use to other technologies utilizing a
   GMPLS control plane are discussed.

1. Introduction

   The purpose of the following information model for WSONs is to
   facilitate constrained lightpath computation and as such is not a
   general purpose network management information model. This constraint
   is frequently referred to as the "wavelength continuity" constraint,
   and the corresponding constrained lightpath computation is known as
   the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem. Hence the
   information model must provide sufficient topology and wavelength
   restriction and availability information to support this computation.
   More details on the RWA process and WSON subsystems and their
   properties can be found in [WSON-Frame]. The model defined here
   includes constraints between WSON signal attributes and network
   elements, but does not include optical impairments.

   In addition to presenting an information model suitable for path
   computation in WSON, this document also highlights model aspects that
   may have general applicability to other technologies utilizing a
   GMPLS control plane. We refer to the information model applicable to
   other technologies beyond WSON as "general" to distinguish from the
   "WSON-specific" model that is applicable only to WSON technology.

3. Routing and Wavelength Assignment Information Model

   We group the following WSON RWA information model into four
   categories regardless of whether they stem from a switching subsystem
   or from a line subsystem:

   o  Node Information

   o  Link Information

   o  Dynamic Node Information

   o  Dynamic Link Information

   Note that this is roughly the categorization used in [G.7715] section
   7.

   In the following we use, where applicable, the reduced Backus-Naur
   form (RBNF) syntax of [RBNF] to aid in defining the RWA information
   model.

   3.1. Dynamic and Relatively Static Information

   All the RWA information of concern in a WSON network is subject to
   change over time.  Equipment can be upgraded; links may be placed in
   or out of service and the like.  However, from the point of view of
   RWA computations there is a difference between information that can
   change with each successive connection establishment in the network
   and that information that is relatively static on the time scales of
   connection establishment. A key example of the former is link
   wavelength usage since this can change with connection setup/teardown
   and this information is a key input to the RWA process.  Examples of
   relatively static information are the potential port connectivity of
   a WDM ROADM, and the channel spacing on a WDM link.

   In this document we will separate, where possible, dynamic and static
   information so that these can be kept separate in possible encodings
   and hence allowing for separate updates of these two types of
   information thereby reducing processing and traffic load caused by
   the timely distribution of the more dynamic RWA WSON information.

4. Node Information (General)

   The node information described here contains the relatively static
   information related to a WSON node. This includes connectivity
   constraints amongst ports and wavelengths since WSON switches can
   exhibit asymmetric switching properties. Additional information could


   Bernstein and Lee Expires August 18, 2010                   [Page 6]

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks     February 2010


   include properties of wavelength converters in the node if any are
   present. In [Switch] it was shown that the wavelength connectivity
   constraints for a large class of practical WSON devices can be
   modeled via switched and fixed connectivity matrices along with
   corresponding switched and fixed port constraints. We include these
   connectivity matrices with our node information the switched and
   fixed port wavelength constraints with the link information.

   Formally,

   <Node_Information> ::= <Node_ID> [<ConnectivityMatrix>...]

   Where the Node_ID would be an appropriate identifier for the node
   within the WSON RWA context.

   Note that multiple connectivity matrices are allowed and hence can
   fully support the most general cases enumerated in [Switch].

   4.1. Connectivity Matrix

   The connectivity matrix (ConnectivityMatrix) represents either the
   potential connectivity matrix for asymmetric switches (e.g. ROADMs
   and such) or fixed connectivity for an asymmetric device such as a
   multiplexer. Note that this matrix does not represent any particular
   internal blocking behavior but indicates which ingress ports and
   wavelengths could possibly be connected to a particular output port.
   Representing internal state dependent blocking for a switch or ROADM
   is beyond the scope of this document and due to it's highly
   implementation dependent nature would most likely not be subject to
   standardization in the future. The connectivity matrix is a
   conceptual M by N matrix representing the potential switched or fixed
   connectivity, where M represents the number of ingress ports and N
   the number of egress ports. We say this is a "conceptual" matrix
   since this matrix tends to exhibit structure that allows for very
   compact representations that are useful for both transmission and
   path computation [Encode].

   Note that the connectivity matrix information element can be useful
   in any technology context where asymmetric switches are utilized.

   ConnectivityMatrix(i, j) ::= <MatrixID> <ConnType> <Matrix>

   Where

   <MatrixID> is a unique identifier for the matrix.

   <ConnType> can be either 0 or 1 depending upon whether the
   connectivity is either fixed or potentially switched.


   Bernstein and Lee Expires August 18, 2010                   [Page 7]

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks     February 2010


   <Matrix> represents the fixed or switched connectivity in that
   Matrix(i, j) = 0 or 1 depending on whether ingress port i can connect
   to egress port j for one or more wavelengths.

   4.2. Shared Risk Node Group

   SRNG: Shared risk group for nodes. The concept of a shared risk link
   group was defined in [RFC4202]. This can be used to achieve a desired
   "amount" of link diversity. It is also desirable to have a similar
   capability to achieve various degrees of node diversity. This is
   explained in [G.7715]. Typical risk groupings for nodes can include
   those nodes in the same building, within the same city, or geographic
   region.

   Since the failure of a node implies the failure of all links
   associated with that node a sufficiently general shared risk link
   group (SRLG) encoding, such as that used in GMPLS routing extensions
   can explicitly incorporate SRNG information.

5. Node Information (WSON specific)

   As discussed in [WSON-Frame] a WSON node may contain electro-optical
   subsystems such as regenerators, wavelength converters or entire
   switching subsystems. The model present here can be used in
   characterizing the accessibility and availability of limited
   resources such as regenerators or wavelength converters as well as
   WSON signal attribute constraints of electro-optical subsystems. As
   such this information element is fairly specific to WSON
   technologies. We refer to regenerator block or wavelength converter
   block as resource block.

   A WSON node may include regenerators or wavelength converters
   arranged in a shared pool. As discussed in [WSON-Frame] this can
   include OEO based WDM switches as well. There are a number of
   different approaches used in the design of WDM switches containing
   regenerator or converter pools. However, from the point of view of
   path computation we need to know the following:

   1. The nodes that support regeneration or wavelength conversion.

   2. The accessibility and availability of a wavelength converter to
      convert from a given ingress wavelength on a particular ingress
      port to a desired egress wavelength on a particular egress port.

   3. Limitations on the types of signals that can be converted and the
      conversions that can be performed.

   This leads to the following formal high level model:


   Bernstein and Lee Expires August 18, 2010                   [Page 8]

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks     February 2010


   <Node_Information> ::= <Node_ID> [<ConnectivityMatrix>...]
   [<ResourcePool>]

   Where

   <ResourcePool> ::= <ResourceBlockInfo>...
   [<ResourceBlockAccessibility>...] [<ResourceWaveConstraints>...]
   [<RBPoolState>]

   First we will address the accessibility of resource blocks then we
   will discuss their properties.

   5.1. Resource Accessibility/Availability

   A similar technique as used to model ROADMs and optical switches can
   be used to model regenerator/converter accessibility. This technique
   was generally discussed in [WSON-Frame] and consisted of a matrix to
   indicate possible connectivity along with wavelength constraints for
   links/ports. Since regenerators or wavelength converters may be
   considered a scarce resource we will also want to our model to
   include as a minimum the usage state (availability) of individual
   regenerators or converters in the pool. Models that incorporate more
   state to further reveal blocking conditions on ingress or egress to
   particular converters are for further study and not included here.

   The three stage model as shown schematically in Figure 1. In this
   model we assume N ingress ports (fibers), P resource blocks
   containing one or more identical resources (e.g. wavelength
   converters), and M egress ports (fibers). Since not all ingress ports
   can necessarily reach each resource block, the model starts with a
   resource pool ingress matrix RI(i,p) = {0,1} whether ingress port i
   can reach potentially reach resource block p.

   Since not all wavelengths can necessarily reach all the resources or
   the resources may have limited input wavelength range we have a set
   of ingress port constraints for each resource. Currently we assume
   that a resource with a resource block can only take a single
   wavelength on input. We can model each resource block ingress port
   constraint via a wavelength set mechanism.

   Next we have a state vector RA(j) = {0,...,k} which tells us the
   number of resources in resource block j in use. This is the only
   state kept in the resource pool model. This state is not necessary
   for modeling "fixed" transponder system or full OEO switches with WDM
   interfaces, i.e., systems where there is no sharing.

   After that, we have a set of resource egress wavelength constraints.
   These constraints indicate what wavelengths a particular resource


   Bernstein and Lee Expires August 18, 2010                   [Page 9]

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks     February 2010


   block can generate or are restricted to generating e.g., a fixed
   regenerator would be limited to a single lambda.

   Finally, we have a resource pool egress matrix RE(p,k) = {0,1}
   depending on whether the output from resource block p can reach
   egress port k. Examples of this method being used to model wavelength
   converter pools for several switch architectures from the literature
   are given in reference [WC-Pool].

   Formally we can specify the model as:

   <ResourceBlockAccessibility ::= <PoolIngressMatrix>
   <PoolEgressMatrix>

   [<ResourceWaveConstraints> ::= <IngressWaveConstraints>
   <EgressWaveConstraints>

   <ResourcePoolState> ::=(<ResourceBlockID><NumResourcesInUse>)...

   Note that except for <ResourcePoolState> all the other components of
   <ResourcePool> are relatively static.



   5.2. Resource Signal Constraints and Processing Capabilities

   The wavelength conversion abilities of a resource (e.g. regenerator,
   wavelength converter) were modeled in the <EgressWaveConstraints>
   previously discussed. As discussed in [WSON-Frame] we can model the
   constraints on an electro-optical resource in terms of input
   constraints, processing capabilities, and output constraints:

   <ResourceBlockInfo> ::=
   ([<ResourceSet>]<InputConstraints><ProcessingCapabilities><OutputCons
   traints>)*

   Where  <ResourceSet> is a list of resource block identifiers with the
   same characteristics. If this set is missing the constraints are
   applied to the entire network element.

   The <InputConstraints> are signal compatibility based constraints.
   The details of these constraints are defined in section 5.3.

   <InputConstraints> ::= <ModulationTypeList> <FECTypeList>
   <BitRateRange> <ClientSignalList>

   The <ProcessingCapabilities> are important operations that the
   resource (or network element) can perform on the signal. The details
   of these capabilities are defined in section 5.3.

   <ProcessingCapabilities> ::= <NumResources>
   <RegenerationCapabilities> <FaultPerfMon> <VendorSpecific>

   The <OutputConstraints> are either restrictions on the properties of
   the signal leaving the resource or network element or options
   concerning the signal properties when leaving the resource or network
   element.

   <OutputConstraints> := <ModulationTypeList><FECTypeList>

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks     February 2010


   5.3. Compatibility and Capability Details

      5.3.1. Modulation Type List

      Modulation type, also known as optical tributary signal class,
      comes in two distinct flavors: (i) ITU-T standardized types; (ii)
      vendor specific types. The permitted modulation type list can
      include any mixture of standardized and vendor specific types.

      <modulation-list>::=
      [<STANDARD_MODULATION>|<VENDOR_MODULATION>]...

      Where the STANDARD_MODULATION object just represents one of the
      ITU-T standardized optical tributary signal class and the
      VENDOR_MODULATION object identifies one vendor specific modulation
      type.

      5.3.2. FEC Type List

      Some devices can handle more than one FEC type and hence a list is
      needed.

      <fec-list>::= [<FEC>]

      Where the FEC object represents one of the ITU-T standardized FECs
      defined in [G.709], [G.707], [G.975.1] or a vendor-specific FEC.

      5.3.3. Bit Rate Range List

      Some devices can handle more than one particular bit rate range
      and hence a list is needed.

      <rate-range-list>::= [<rate-range>]...

      <rate-range>::=<START_RATE><END_RATE>

      Where the START_RATE object represents the lower end of the range
      and the END_RATE object represents the higher end of the range.

      5.3.4. Acceptable Client Signal List

      The list is simply:

      <client-signal-list>::=[<GPID>]...

      Where the Generalized Protocol Identifiers (GPID) object
      represents one of the IETF standardized GPID values as defined in
      [RFC3471] and [RFC4328].

      5.3.5. Processing Capability List

     We have defined ProcessingCapabilities in Section 5.2 as follows:

     <ProcessingCapabilities> ::= <NumResources>
     <RegenerationCapabilities> <FaultPerfMon> <VendorSpecific>

     The processing capability list sub-TLV is a list of processing
     functions that the WSON network element (NE) can perform on the
     signal including:

        1. Number of Resources within the block

        2. Regeneration capability

        3. Fault and performance monitoring

        4. Vendor Specific capability

     Note that the code points for Fault and performance monitoring and
     vendor specific capability are subject to further study.



6. Link Information (General)

   MPLS-TE routing protocol extensions for OSPF and IS-IS [RFC3630],
   [RFC5305] along with GMPLS routing protocol extensions for OSPF and
   IS-IS [RFC4203, RFC5307] provide the bulk of the relatively static
   link information needed by the RWA process. However, WSON networks
   bring in additional link related constraints. These stem from WDM
   line system characterization, laser transmitter tuning restrictions,
   and switching subsystem port wavelength constraints, e.g., colored
   ROADM drop ports.

   In the following summarize both information from existing GMPLS route
   protocols and new information that maybe needed by the RWA process.

   <LinkInfo> ::=  <LinkID> [<AdministrativeGroup>] [<InterfaceCapDesc>]
   [<Protection>] [<SRLG>]... [<TrafficEngineeringMetric>]
   [<PortLabelRestriction>]

   6.1. Administrative Group

   AdministrativeGroup: Defined in [RFC3630]. Each set bit corresponds
   to one administrative group assigned to the interface.  A link may
   belong to multiple groups. This is a configured quantity and can be
   used to influence routing decisions.

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks     February 2010


   6.2. Interface Switching Capability Descriptor

   InterfaceSwCapDesc: Defined in [RFC4202], lets us know the different
   switching capabilities on this GMPLS interface. In both [RFC4203] and
   [RFC5307] this information gets combined with the maximum LSP
   bandwidth that can be used on this link at eight different priority
   levels.

   6.3. Link Protection Type (for this link)

   Protection: Defined in [RFC4202] and implemented in [RFC4203,
   RFC5307]. Used to indicate what protection, if any, is guarding this
   link.

   6.4. Shared Risk Link Group Information

   SRLG: Defined in [RFC4202] and implemented in [RFC4203, RFC5307].
   This allows for the grouping of links into shared risk groups, i.e.,
   those links that are likely, for some reason, to fail at the same
   time.

   6.5. Traffic Engineering Metric

   TrafficEngineeringMetric: Defined in [RFC3630].  This allows for the
   definition of one additional link metric value for traffic
   engineering separate from the IP link state routing protocols link
   metric. Note that multiple "link metric values" could find use in
   optical networks, however it would be more useful to the RWA process
   to assign these specific meanings such as link mile metric, or
   probability of failure metric, etc...

   6.6. Port Label (Wavelength) Restrictions

   Port label (wavelength) restrictions (PortLabelRestriction) model the
   label (wavelength) restrictions that the link and various optical
   devices such as OXCs, ROADMs, and waveband multiplexers may impose on
   a port. These restrictions tell us what wavelength may or may not be
   used on a link and are relatively static. This plays an important
   role in fully characterizing a WSON switching device [Switch]. Port
   wavelength restrictions are specified relative to the port in general
   or to a specific connectivity matrix (section 4.1.  Reference
   [Switch] gives an example where both switch and fixed connectivity
   matrices are used and both types of constraints occur on the same
   port. Such restrictions could be applied generally to other label
   types in GMPLS by adding new kinds of restrictions.

   <PortLabelRestriction> ::= [<GeneralPortRestrictions>...]
   [<MatrixSpecificRestrictions>...]

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks     February 2010


   <GeneralPortRestrictions> ::= <RestrictionType>
   [<RestrictionParameters>]

   <MatrixSpecificRestriction> ::= <MatrixID> <RestrictionType>
   [<RestrictionParameters>]

   <RestrictionParameters> ::= [<LabelSet>...] [<MaxNumChannels>]
   [<MaxWaveBandWidth>]



   Where

   MatrixID is the ID of the corresponding connectivity matrix (section
   4.1.

   The RestrictionType parameter is used to specify general port
   restrictions and matrix specific restrictions. It can take the
   following values and meanings:

   SIMPLE_WAVELENGTH:   Simple wavelength set restriction; The
   wavelength set parameter is required.

   CHANNEL_COUNT: The number of channels is restricted to be less than
   or equal to the Max number of channels parameter (which is required).

   WAVEBAND1:   Waveband device with a tunable center frequency and
   passband. This constraint is characterized by the MaxWaveBandWidth
   parameters which indicates the maximum width of the waveband in terms
   of channels. Note that an additional wavelength set can be used to
   indicate the overall tuning range. Specific center frequency tuning
   information can be obtained from dynamic channel in use information.
   It is assumed that both center frequency and bandwidth (Q) tuning can
   be done without causing faults in existing signals.

   Restriction specific parameters are used with one or more of the
   previously listed restriction types. The currently defined parameters
   are:

     LabelSet is a conceptual set of labels (wavelengths).

     MaxNumChannels is the maximum number of channels that can be
     simultaneously used (relative to either a port or a matrix).

     MaxWaveBandWidth is the maximum width of a tunable waveband
     switching device.




   Bernstein and Lee Expires August 18, 2010                   [Page 15]

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks     February 2010


   For example, if the port is a "colored" drop port of a ROADM then we
   have two restrictions: (a) CHANNEL_COUNT, with MaxNumChannels = 1,
   and (b) SIMPLE_WAVELENGTH, with the wavelength set consisting of a
   single member corresponding to the frequency of the permitted
   wavelength. See [Switch] for a complete waveband example.

   This information model for port wavelength (label) restrictions is
   fairly general in that it can be applied to ports that have label
   restrictions only or to ports that are part of an asymmetric switch
   and have label restrictions. In addition, the types of label
   restrictions that can be supported are extensible.

7. Dynamic Components of the Information Model

   In the previously presented information model there are a limited
   number of information elements that are dynamic, i.e., subject to
   change with subsequent establishment and teardown of connections.
   Depending on the protocol used to convey this overall information
   model it may be possible to send this dynamic information separate
   from the relatively larger amount of static information needed to
   characterize WSON's and their network elements.

   7.1. Dynamic Link Information (General)

   For WSON links wavelength availability and wavelengths in use for
   shared backup purposes can be considered dynamic information and
   hence we can isolate the dynamic information in the following set:

   <DynamicLinkInfo> ::=  <LinkID> <AvailableLabels>
   [<SharedBackupLabels>]

   AvailableLabels is a set of labels (wavelengths) currently available
   on the link. Given this information and the port wavelength
   restrictions we can also determine which wavelengths are currently in
   use. This parameter could potential be used with other technologies
   that GMPLS currently covers or may cover in the future.

   SharedBackupLabels is a set of labels (wavelengths)currently used for
   shared backup protection on the link. An example usage of this
   information in a WSON setting is given in [Shared]. This parameter
   could potential be used with other technologies that GMPLS currently
   covers or may cover in the future.

   7.2. Dynamic Node Information (WSON Specific)

   Currently the only node information that can be considered dynamic is
   the resource pool state and can be isolated into a dynamic node
   information element as follows:

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks     February 2010


   <DynamicNodeInfo> ::=  <NodeID> [<ResourcePoolState>]



8. Security Considerations

   This document discussed an information model for RWA computation in
   WSONs. Such a model is very similar from a security standpoint of the
   information that can be currently conveyed via GMPLS routing
   protocols.  Such information includes network topology, link state
   and current utilization, and well as the capabilities of switches and
   routers within the network.  As such this information should be
   protected from disclosure to unintended recipients.  In addition, the
   intentional modification of this information can significantly affect
   network operations, particularly due to the large capacity of the
   optical infrastructure to be controlled.



9. IANA Considerations

   This informational document does not make any requests for IANA
   action.
