 RSVP-TE Signaling Extension For Management Plane To Control Plane LSP
             Handover In A GMPLS Enabled Transport Network.
                 draft-ietf-ccamp-pc-spc-rsvpte-ext-05

Abstract

   In a transport network scenario, where Data Plane connections are
   controlled either by a Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching
   (GMPLS) Control Plane (Soft Permanent Connections - SPC) or by a
   Management System (Permanent Connections - PC) may independently
   coexist, the ability of transforming an existing PC into a SPC and
   vice versa - without actually affecting Data Plane traffic being
   carried over it - is a requirement.  The requirements for the
   conversion between permanent connections and switched connections in
   a GMPLS Network are defined in [RFC5493].

   This memo describes an extension to GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling that
   enables the transfer of connection ownership between the Management
   and the Control Planes.  Such a transfer is referred to as a
   Handover.  This document defines all Handover related procedures.
   This includes the handling of failure conditions and subsequent
   reversion to original state.  A basic premise of the extension is
   that the handover procedures must never impact an already established
   Data plane.

Internet-Draft     RSVP-TE Ext for MP2CP LSP Handover       January 2010


1.  Introduction

   In a typical traditional transport network scenario, Data Plane (DP)
   connections between two endpoints are controlled by means of a
   Network Management System (NMS) operating within Management Plane
   (MP).  NMS/MP is the owner of such transport connections, being
   responsible of their set up, tear down and maintenance.

   The adoption of a Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) [RFC3945] Control Plane
   (CP) in a network that is already in service - controlled by NMS at
   MP level - introduces the need for a procedure able to coordinate a
   controlled handover of a data plane connection from MP to CP.

   In addition, the control handover in the opposite direction, from CP
   to MP should be possible as well.  The procedures described in this
   memo can be applied to an LSP in any DP switching technology and any
   network architecture.

   This memo describes an extension to GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling that
   enables the handover of connection ownership between the Management
   and the Control Planes.  All handover related procedures are defined
   below.  This includes the handling of failure conditions and
   subsequent reversion to original state.  A basic premise of the
   extension is that the handover procedures must never impact the
   exchange of user data on LSPs that are already established in the DP.

1.1.  Dedication

   We would like to dedicate this work to our friend and colleague Dino
   Bramanti, who passed away at the early age of 38.  Dino has been
   involved in this work since its beginning.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Motivation

   The main motivation behind this work is the definition of a simple
   and very low impact procedure that satisfies the requirements defined
   in [RFC5493].  Such a procedure is aimed at giving the transport
   network operators the chance to handover the ownership of existing
   LSPs provisioned by NMS from the MP to the CP without disrupting user
   traffic flowing on them.  Handover from MP to CP (i.e. when existing

   DP connection ownership and control is passed from MP to CP) has been
   defined as a mandatory requirement, while the opposite operation, CP
   to MP handover, has been considered as a nice-to-have feature that
   can be seen as an emergency procedure to disable the CP and take the
   manual control of the LSP.  For more details on requirements and
   motivations please refer to [RFC5493].


4.  Procedures

   The modification defined in this document refers only to the
   ADMIN_STATUS Object, that is, the message flow is left unmodified for
   both LSP set-up and deletion.  Moreover a new Error Value is defined
   to identify the failure of a Handover procedure.

   The following paragraphs give detailed description of the "MP to CP
   handover" and "CP to MP handover" procedures, based on the usage a
   newly defined bit called H bit.

   The MP to CP handover procedures support two different methods for
   retrieving required information.  The primary one consists of
   receiving the full Explicit Route Object (ERO) from the MP while the
   alternative one is described in Section 5.

   Please note that if the primary method is used the labels SHOULD be
   included in the ERO and for bidirectional LSPs both upstream and
   downstream labels SHOULD be included.  Per Section 5.1.1. of
   [RFC3473], the labels are indicated on an output basis.  As
   described, this means that the labels are used by the upstream node
   to create the LABEL_SET Object and, for bidirectional LSPs,
   UPSTREAM_LABEL Object used in the outgoing Path message.

4.1.  MP to CP handover: LSP Ownership Transfer From Management Plane To
      Control Plane

   The MP to CP handover procedure MUST create an RSVP-TE session along
   the path of the LSP to be moved from MP to CP, associating it to the
   existing cross-connected resources owned by the MP (e.g. lambdas,
   time slots or reserved bandwidth) and at the same time transferring
   their ownership to the CP.

   The operator instructs the ingress node to handover control of the
   LSP from the MP to the CP.  In this handover mode, it supplies the
   exact path of the LSP including any resource reservation and label
   information.

   The ingress MUST check that no corresponding Path state exists and
   that corresponding Data Plane state does exist.  If there is an



Caviglia, et al.          Expires July 12, 2010                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     RSVP-TE Ext for MP2CP LSP Handover       January 2010


   error, this MUST be reported to the operator and further protocol
   action MUST NOT be taken.

   The ingress signals the LSP using a Path message with the H bit and R
   bit set in the ADMIN_STATUS object.  In this mode of handover, the
   Path message also carries an ERO that includes Label subobjects
   indicating the labels used by the LSP at each hop.  The ingress MUST
   start the Expiration timer (see Section 4.2.1.2 for expiration of
   this timer).  Such timer SHOULD be configurable per LSP.

   Each LSR that receives a Path message with the H bit set checks to
   see whether there is any matching Path state.

      - If matching Path state is found with the H bit set, this is a
      Path refresh and should be treated accordingly [RFC3473].
      - If matching Path state is found with the H bit clear, this is an
      error and MUST be treated according to the error case description
      in Section 4.2.xx
      - If no Path state is found, the LSR goes on to check whether
      there is any matching Data Plane state.
      - If no matching Data Plane state is found (including only
      partially matching Data Plane state), this is an error or a race
      condition.  It MUST be handled according to the description in
      Section 4.2.xx
      - If matching Data Plane state is found, the LSR MUST save the
      Path state (including the set H bit), and MUST forward the Path
      message to the egress.  The LSR MUST retain any MP state
      associated with the LSP at this point.

   An egress LSR MUST act as any other LSR, except that there is no
   downstream node to which to forward the Path message.  If all checks
   are passed, the egress MUST respond with a Resv with the H bit set.

   A transit LSR MUST process each Resv according to the normal rules of
   [RFC3473].

   When an ingress LSR receives a Resv message carrying the H bit set,
   it checks the Expiration Timer.

   - If the timer is not running, the Resv is treated as a refresh and
   no special action is taken [RFC3473].

   - If the timer is running, the ingress MUST cancel the timer and MAY
   notify the operator that the first stage of handover is complete.
   The ingress MUST send a Path message that is no different from the
   previous message except that the H bit MUST be clear.

   The Path message with the H bit clear will travel the length of the

   LSP and will result in the return of a Resv with the H bit clear
   according to normal processing [RFC3473].  As a result, the H bit
   will be cleared in the stored Path state at each transit LSR and at
   the egress LSR.  Each LSR SHOULD release any associated MP state
   associated with the LSP when it receives the Path message with H bit
   clear.

   When the ingress receives a Resv with the H bit clear, the handover
   is completed.  The ingress SHOULD notify the operator that the
   handover is correctly completed.

4.2.  MP to CP Handover Procedure Failure Handling

   In the case of MP to CP Handover, two different failure scenarios can
   happen: Path Failure and Resv Failure.  Moreover, each failure can be
   due to two different causes: DP failure or Communication Failure.  In
   any case the LSP ownership MUST be immediately rolled back to the one
   previous to the handover procedure.  A section for each combination
   will be analyzed in the following.

4.2.1.  MP to CP Handover Failure - Path Failure

4.2.1.1.  MP to CP Handover Failure - Path message and Data Plane
          Failure

   In this paragraph we will analyze the case where the handover
   procedure fails during the Path message processing.



     |      Path      |                |                |

                      MP2CP - Path Msg and DP Failure

   If an error occurs in an LSR or a LER, the last node that has
   received the Path message MUST send a PathErr message in the upstream
   direction and the handover procedure is aborted.  Upon receiving the
   PathErr message the Path state of the node MUST be removed.  The
   PathErr message SHOULD have the Path_State_Removed flag set.

   Nodes receiving a PathErr message MUST follow standard PathErr

   message processing with the exception that when their local state
   indicates that a Handover is in progress (based on the H bit in the
   Path message) the associated DP resources MUST NOT be impacted during
   such processing and the LSR MUST revert the LSP ownership to the MP.

4.2.1.2.  MP to CP Handover Failure - Path message and Communication
          failure

   Other possible scenarios are shown in the following pictures and are
   based on the inability to reach a node along the path of the LSP.

   The below scenario postulates the usage of a reliable message
   delivery based on the mechanism defined in [RFC2961].



     |      Path      |                |                |
     |--------------->|      Path      |                |
     |                |---------------X|                |
     |                |---------------X|                |
     |                |      ...       |                |
     |                |---------------X|                |
     |                |                |                |
   Ingress LER      LSR A            LSR B       Egress LER

      MP2CP - Path Msg and Communication Failure (reliable delivery)

   The Path message sent from LSR A towards LSR B is lost or does not
   reach the destination for any reason.  As a reliable delivery
   mechanism is implemented, LSR A retransmits the Path message for a
   configurable number of times and if no ack is received the handover
   procedure will be aborted (via the Expiration timer).

   In the next scenario RSVP-TE messages are sent without reliable
   message delivery, that is, no [RFC2961] MessageID procedure is used.

     MP2CP - Path Msg and Communication Failure (no reliable delivery)

   If the Resv message is not received before the expiration of the
   Expiration timer the handover procedure is aborted as described in
   Section 4.1.  Please note that any node that has forwarded a Path
   (LSR A), i.e. has installed local path state, MUST send a PathTear
   when that state is removed.

4.2.2.  MP to CP Handover Failure - Resv Error

4.2.2.1.  MP to CP Handover Failure - Resv Error and Data Plane failure

   In the case of failure occurrence during the Resv message processing,
   (in case there has been any change in the data plane during the
   signaling) the node MUST send a PathErr message in the upstream
   direction.  The PathErr message is constructed and processed as
   defined above in Section 4.2.1.1.  The failure detection node MUST
   also send a PathTear message downstream.  The PathTear message is
   constructed and processed as defined above in Section 4.2.1.1.



     |      Path      |      Path      |      Path      |
     |--------------->|--------------->|--------------->|
     |                |                |      Resv      |

     |<---------------|--------------->|--------------->|

   Ingress LER      LSR A            LSR B       Egress LER

                     MP2CP - Resv Error and DP Failure

   In the case shown in the above picture, the failure occurs in LSR A.
   A PathTear message is sent towards B and a PathErr message (with
   ErrorCode set to "Handover Procedure Failure") is sent in the
   upstream direction.  The PathErr and PathTear messages remove the
   Path state established by the Path messages along the nodes of the
   LSP and abort the handover procedure.

   Please note that the failure occurred after the handover procedure
   was successfully completed in LSR B, but Handover state will still be
   maintained locally as, per Section 4.1, a Path message with the H bit
   clear will have not yet been sent or received.  A node that receives
   a PahTear when it has Path state with the H bit set MUST remove Path
   state, but MUST NOT change data plane state.  It MUST return LSP
   ownership to the MP.

   When a Resv message cannot reach one or more of the upstream nodes,
   the procedure is quite similar to the one previously seen about the
   Path message.  Even in this case it is possible to distinguish two
   different scenarios.

   In the first scenario we consider the utilization of a reliable
   message delivery based on the mechanism defined in [RFC2961].  After
   a correct forwarding of the Path message along the nodes of the LSP,
   the Egress LSR sends a Resv message in the opposite direction.  It
   might happen that the Resv message does not reach the ingress LER or
   an LSR, say LSR A. LSR B MUST send a Resv message again for a
   configurable number of times and then, if the delivery does not
   succeed, the adoption procedure will be aborted (via the Expiration
   timer).




     |      Path      |      Path      |      Path      |
     |--------------->|--------------->|--------------->|
     |                |                |      Resv      |
     |                |      Resv      |<---------------|

     |                |      X---------|                |
     |                |      ...       |                |
     |                |      X---------|                |
     |                |                |                |
   Ingress LER      LSR A            LSR B       Egress LER

     MP2CP - Resv Error and Communication Failure (reliable delivery)

   Considering that the Resv message did not manage to reach LSR A, it
   is highly probable that the PathErr would fail too.  Due to this
   fact, the Expiration timer is used on the Ingress LER after sending
   the path and on LSR A after forwarding it.  When the timer expires,
   if no Resv or PathErr message is received, the handover procedure is
   aborted as described in Section 4.1 and the LSP ownership returned to
   the Management Plane.

   The following picture, on the other hand, shows the scenario in which
   no reliable delivery mechanism is implemented.

   If non Resv message is received before the Expiration timer expires,
   the ingress LER follows the same procedure defined in Section 4.1.

4.2.2.3.  MP to CP Handover Failure - Node Graceful Restart

   In the case of node restart and graceful restart is enabled then one
   of the following scenarios will happen.

   Case I - Finite Restart Time

   In this case, the Restart Time (see [RFC3473]) is finite, i.e., not a
   value of 0xffffffff.  In the sequence diagram below, assume LSR A
   restarts.  If the ingress LER does not receive the Resv message in
   time it MUST abort the handover process by generating a PathTear
   message downstream.  Also, if LSR A does not complete the restart
   process within the restart time interval then LSR B MUST start
   tearing down all LSPs between LSR A and LSR B and this includes the
   LSP that is being used to carry out the handover of MP resources to
   CP.  LSP B MUST generate a PathTear message downstream and a PathErr
   message upstream.  Both LSR B and the egress LER MUST NOT release the
   DP resources because in both nodes the H bit is set in the local Path
   state.

                  MP2CP - Node graceful restart - Case I

   Case II - Infinite Restart Time

   In this case, the Restart Time (see [RFC3473]) indicates that the
   restart of the sender's control plane may occur over an indeterminate
   interval, i.e., is 0xffffffff.  The sequence is quite similar to the
   previous one.  In this sequence the restart timer will not expire in
   LSR B since it is run infinitely.  Instead after LSR A restarts LSR B
   MUST start the recovery timer.  The recovery timer will expire since
   there will be no Path message with the RECOVERY LABEL received from
   LSR A given the ingress node had already removed the local Path state
   after it aborts the handover process.  Thus LSR B MUST tear-down the
   specific LSP that is being used to convert the MP resources to CP by
   generating a PathTear message downstream and PathErr message
   upstream.  Similarly to the previous case both LSR B and the egress
   LER MUST NOT release the DP resources because the H bit is set in the
   local Path state.

   Ingress LER did not abort the handover process.  Once LSR A restarts
   the ingress LER MUST re-generate the Path message with the H bit set.
   When LSR B receives the Path message it MAY generate a PathErr since
   the RECOVERY LABEL may not be present.  The reason is LSR A may not
   have the label.  Similarly LSR B and egress LER MUST NOT release the
   DP resources since the H bit is set.

4.3.  CP to MP handover : LSP Ownership Transfer From Control Plane To
      Management Plane

   Let's now consider the case of LSP Ownership Transfer From Control
   Plane To Management Plane.  Also in this section we will analyze the
   handover procedure success and failure.

   The scenario is still a DP connection between two nodes acting as
   ingress and egress for a LSP, but in this case the CP has the
   ownership and control of the LSP.  The CP to MP handover procedure
   MUST delete the existing RSVP-TE session information and MUST NOT
   affect the cross-connected resources, but just move their ownership
   to the MP.

   In other words, after LSP ownership transfer from CP to MP, the LSP
   is no longer under control of RSVP-TE, which is no more able to "see"
   the LSP itself.  The CP to MP handover procedure MUST be a standard
   LSP deletion procedure as described in Section 7.2.1 of [RFC3473].
   The procedure is initiated at the ingress node of the LSP by a MP
   entity.  Ingress node and MP exchange the relevant information for
   this task and then propagate it over CP by means of RSVP-TE tear down
   signaling as described below.

   The ingress node MUST send a Path message in the downstream direction
   with Handover and Reflect bits set in the ADMIN_STATUS Object.  No
   action is taken over the DP and transit LSRs must forward such
   message towards the egress node.  All of the nodes MUST keep track of
   the procedure storing the H bit in their local Path and Resv states.
   Then every node waits for the H bit to be received within the related
   Resv message.  After the Resv message is received by the ingress LER,
   it MUST send a PathTear message in order to clear the whole LSP
   information recorded on the RSVP-TE data structures of the nodes.
   Downstream nodes processing a PathTear message which follows a Path
   message with the H bit set, MUST NOT remove any associated data plane
   state.  In other words, a normal LSP tear down signaling is exchanged
   between nodes traversed by the LSP, but H bit set in the Path message
   indicates that no DP action has to correspond to CP signaling.

4.4.  CP to MP Handover Procedure Failure

   Failures during CP to MP handover procedure MUST NOT result in the
   removal of any associated data plane state.  To that end, when a Resv
   message containing an ADMIN_STATUS Object with the H bit is not
   received during the period of time described in Section 7.2.2. of
   [RFC3473] different processing is required.  Specifically, the
   ingress node MUST NOT send a PathTear message before a Resv message
   containing the H bit is received.  The ingress node MAY choose to
   report the failure in the CP to MP handover procedure via the MP.

   The CP to MP handover procedure can fail also due to two causes:
   PathTear lost or node down.  In the former case, if the LSP is not
   under MP control after the Expiration Timer elapses, a manual
   intervention from the network operator is requested, while in the
   latter case different scenarios may happen:

   - CASE I - Path message and node down



           |      Path      |      Path      X                |
           |--------------->|--------------X                  |
           |                |                                 |
           |                |                X                |
           |                |                |                |
           |                |                |                |
      Ingress LER      LSR A            LSR B       Egress LER

   Per [RFC 3473] section 7.2.2 the ingress node should wait for a
   configurable amount of time (30 seconds by default) and then send a
   PathTear message.  In this case the normal deletion procedure MUST
   NOT be followed.  When the Expiration timer elapses a manual
   intervention from network operator is requested.

   - CASE II - Resv message and node down



           |      Path      |      Path      |      Path      |
           |--------------->|--------------->|--------------->|
           |                |                |      Resv      |
           |                |      Resv      |<---------------|
           |                X      X---------|                |
           |                                 |                |
           |                X                |                |
           |                |                |                |
      Ingress LER      LSR A            LSR B       Egress LER

   The procedure to be followed is the same depicted in CASE I. The
   network operator can ask for the automatic CP to MP procedure again
   after the failed node comes back up.  Per [RFC 3473] section 7.2 the
   nodes will forward the new Path and Resv messages correctly.

   - CASE III - PathTear message and node down

      Ingress LER      LSR A            LSR B       Egress LER

   This scenario can be managed as a normal PathTear lost described
   above in this section.


5.  Minimum Information for MP to CP Handover

   An alternative way of getting the LSP related information required
   for the MP to CP handover is also defined in this draft.  The
   rationale behind this way is that only a minimal set of information
   is handed over from MP to CP at LSPs Ingress node.  Instead of
   collecting within MP all the LSP relevant information down to the
   Label level, formatting it to an ERO and passing it to CP, as in
   previously described solution, it is possible to start with a minimum
   amount of information.  The full ERO method and the partial/no ERO
   one do not exclude each other; both methods are required.

   At the ingress node, the information needed to specify the LSP is the
   outgoing interface ID, upstream label and downstream label of this
   interface and the egress node ID.  The remaining information about an
   existing LSP can then be collected hop by hop, as the signaling is
   going on, by looking up the cross-connection table in DP at each node
   along the LSP path.

   Starting from the information available at ingress LER about the
   outgoing interface ID of that ingress node, the incoming interface ID
   of next hop can be found by looking up the link resource table/
   database in the LER itself.

   The Path message is hence built with the LABEL_SET Object ([RFC3473])
   and the UPSTREAM_LABEL Object ([RFC3473]), where the upstream label
   and downstream label of ingress outgoing interface of the LSP are
   included in these two objects.  In addition to above mentioned
   objects, the Path message MUST include the ADMIN_STATUS Object with H
   bit set, as already defined in previous chapters for the detailed ERO
   based way of proceeding.  Such handover Path is sent to the incoming
   interface of next hop.  When this Path message reaches the second
   node along the LSP path, the information about incoming interface ID

Internet-Draft     RSVP-TE Ext for MP2CP LSP Handover       January 2010


   and the upstream and downstream labels of this interface is extracted
   from it and it is used to find next hop outgoing interface ID and the
   upstream/downstream labels by looking up the DP cross-connection
   table.

   After having determined in this way the parameters describing the
   LSPs next hop, the outgoing Path message to be sent is built
   replacing the LABEL_SET Object and UPSTREAM_LABEL Object content with
   the looked-up values of upstream and downstream labels.

   By repeating this procedure for each transit node along the LSP, it
   is possible to make the handover Path message reach the egress node,
   exactly following the LSP that is in place over DP.  The ERO MAY in
   this case be included in the Path message as an optional object, and
   MAY be filled with the LSP relevant information down to either the
   port level with interface ID or the Label level with upstream and
   downstream labels.  The ERO can be used to check the consistency of
   resource in DP down to the port level or label level at each
   intermediate node along the LSP path.

   Where the DP path continues beyond the egress, by indicating the
   Egress label at the head-end of an LSP, the traffic can be directed
   to the right destination.  The GMPLS Signaling Procedure for Egress
   Control is described in [RFC4003]


6.  RSVP Message Formats

   This memo does not introduce any modification in RSVP messages object
   composition.


7.  Objects Modification

   The modifications required concern two RSVP objects: the ADMIN_STATUS
   and the ERROR_SPEC Object.

7.1.  Administrative Status Object

   This memo introduces a new flag into the ADMIN_STATUS object.  The
   ADMIN_STATUS Object is defined in [RFC3473].  This document uses the
   H bit of the ADMIN_STATUS Object.  The bit is bit number (TBD by
   IANA) (25).

7.2.  Error Spec Object

   It is possible that a failure, such as the loss of DCN connection or
   the restart of a node, occurs during the LSP ownership handing over.

   In this case the LSP handover procedure is interrupted, the ownership
   of the LSP must remain with the ownership prior to the initiation of
   the handover procedure.  It is important that the transaction failure
   does not affect the DP.  The LSP is kept in place and no traffic hit
   occurs.

   The failure is signaled by PathErr in the upstream direction and
   PathTear Messages in the downstream direction.  The PathErr messages
   include an ERROR_SPEC Object specifying the causes of the failure.

   This memo introduces a new Error Code (with different Error Values)
   into the ERROR_SPEC Object, defined in [RFC2205].

   The defined Error Code is "Handover Procedure Failure", and its value
   is (TBD by IANA)(35).  For this Error Code the following Error Values
   are defined:

      1 = Cross-connection mismatch

      2 = Other failure


8.  Compatibility

   The main requirement for Handover procedure to work is that all nodes
   along the path MUST support the extension defined in this draft.
   This requirement translates to an administrative requirement as it is
   not enforced at the protocol level.  As defined, non-supporting will
   simply propagate the H bit without setting local state.  This may
   result in an impact data traffic during the handover procedure.


9.  Acknowledgments

   We wish to thank Adrian Farrel and Lou Berger for their assistance
   and precious advices to prepare this draft for publication.  We also
   wish to thank Nicola Ciulli (Nextworks), that contributed to the
   initial stage of this draft.

11.  Security Considerations

   The procedures described in this document rely completely on RSVP-TE
   messages and mechanism.  The use of H bit set in ADMIN_STATUS Object
   basically informs the receiving entity that no operations are to be
   done over DP as consequence of such special signaling flow.  Using
   specially flagged signaling messages we want to limit the function of
   setup and tear down messages to CP, making them not effective over
   related DP resource usage.

   However the handover procedures allow the control plane to be used to
   take an LSP out of the control of the Management Plane.  This could
   cause considerable disruption and could introduce a new security
   concern.  As a consequence the use of GMPLS security techniques is
   more important.  For RSVP-TE Security please refer to [RFC3473],
   while for GMPLS security framework please refer to [sec-fwk].


12.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has been asked to manage the bit allocations for the
   ADMIN_STATUS Object ([RFC3473]).  This document requires the
   allocation of the Handover bit: the H bit.  IANA is requested to
   allocate a bit for this purpose.

   IANA has also been asked to allocate a new error code:

         This Error Code has the following globally-defined Error
         Value sub-code:
