               Things To Be Included in RFC 3484 Revision
                 draft-ietf-6man-rfc3484-revise-00.txt

Abstract

   RFC 3484 has several known issues to be fixed.  Deprecation of IPv6
   site-local unicast address and the coming of ULA brought some
   preferable changes to the rules.  Additionally, the rule 9 of the
   destination address selection rules, namely the longest matching
   rule, is known for its adverse effect on the round robin DNS
   technique.  This document covers these points to be fixed and
   proposes possible useful changes to be included in the revision of
   RFC 3484.

Internet-Draft               RFC3484 Revise               September 2010


1.  Introduction

   RFC 3484 [RFC3484] defines default address selection rules for IPv6
   and IPv4.  Because of the deprecation of IPv6 site-local unicast
   address[RFC3879] and the coming of ULA, [RFC4193] these rules in RFC
   3484 are known to cause communication failures depending on the
   network environment.

   Additionally, there was a discussion at v6ops and ietf mailing lists
   that the rule 9 of the destination address selection has a serious
   adverse effect on the round robin DNS technique.  [RFC1794] RFC 3484
   defines that the destination address selection rule 9 should be
   applied to both IPv4 and IPv6, which spoils the DNS based load
   balancing technique that is widely used in the IPv4 Internet today.

   Remi Denis-Courmont summarized NAT related address selection problems
   and possible solutions in [I-D.denis-v6ops-nat-addrsel].

   Problems related to IPv6 and IPv4 address selection are described in
   RFC 5220 [RFC5220].  Some of them can be fixed by updating RFC 3484,
   and some of the others are solved by address selection design team's
   proposal [I-D.chown-addr-select-considerations].

   This document covers these points to be fixed and proposes possible
   useful changes to be included in the revision of RFC 3484.

1.1.  Problem Example

   When an enterprise has IPv4 Internet connectivity but does not yet
   have IPv6 Internet connectivity, and the enterprise wants to provide
   site-local IPv6 connectivity, ULA is the best choice for site-local
   IPv6 connectivity.  Each employee host will have both an IPv4 global
   or private address [RFC1918] and a ULA.  Here, when this host tries
   to connect to Host-C that has registered both A and AAAA records in
   the DNS, the host will choose AAAA as the destination address and ULA
   for the source address.  This will clearly result in a connection
   failure.

                                [Fig. 1]

   This problem can be solved by changing the scope of ULA to site-
   local, or by adding one entry to the default policy table that sets
   lower priority for ULA than IPv4 address.

   This problem was mentioned at ipv6 mailing lists by Pekka Savola.


2.  Proposed Changes to RFC 3484

2.1.  Changes related to the default policy table

   The default policy table is defined in RFC 3484 Section 2.1 as
   follows:

         Prefix        Precedence Label
         ::1/128               50     0
         ::/0                  40     1
         2002::/16             30     2
         ::/96                 20     3
         ::ffff:0:0/96         10     4

   The changes that should be included into the default policy table are
   those rules that are universally useful and do no harm in every
   reasonable network envionment.  The changes we should consider for
   the default policy table are listed in this sub-section.

   The policy table is defined to be configurable.  The changes that are
   useful not universally but locally can be put into the policy table
   manually or by using the auto-configuration mechanism proposed as a
   DHCP option [I-D.fujisaki-dhc-addr-select-opt].

2.1.1.  Arrival of ULA

   RFC 5220 Section 2.1.4, 2.2.2, and 2.2.3 describes address selection
   problems related to ULA.  These problems can be solved by changing
   the scope of ULA to site-local, or by adding an entry for default
   policy table entry that has its own label for ULA.

   In its nature, ULA has global scope.  This is because ULA's scope is
   defined to be defined in routing mechanism.  It may be the case that
   ULA and global IPv6 address are used for source and destination
   addresses of communication.

   On the other hand, to prioritize ULA to ULA communication is
   basically reasonable.  ULA should not be exposed to outside of its
   routable routing domain, so if ULA is given from the application as a
   candidate destination address, it can be generally expected that the
   ULA is within or at least close to the source host.

   Therefore, the scope of ULA should be global, and prioritization of
   ULA to ULA communication should be implemented in policy table, by
   assigning its own label for ULA fc00::/7.

   Discussion:  Centrally assigned ULA [I-D.ietf-ipv6-ula-central] is
      proposed, and assigned fc00::/8.  Using the different labels for
      fc00::/8 and fd00::/8 makes sense if we can assume the same kind
      of address block is assigned in the same or adjacent network.
      However, the way of assignment and network adjancency may not have
      any relationships.

2.1.2.  Arrival of Teredo and harm of transitional mechanisms

   Teredo [RFC4380] is defined and has been assigned 2001::/32.
   Teredo's priority should be less or equal to 6to4, considering its
   characteristic of tunnel mechanism.  About Windows, this is already
   in the implementation.

   Discussion:  Regarding the prioritization between IPv4 and these
      transitional mechanisms, the connectivity of them are recently
      known to be worse than IPv4.  These mechiansms are said to be the
      last resort access to IPv6 resources.  While 6to4 should have
      higher precedence over Teredo, in that 6to4 host to 6to4 host
      communication can be over IPv4, which can result in more optimal
      path, and 6to4 does not need NAT traversal.

2.1.3.  Deprecated addresses

   IPv4-compatible IPv6 address is deprecated.  [RFC4291] IPv6 site-
   local unicast address is deprecated.  [RFC3879] Moreover, 6bone
   testing address was [RFC3701] The issue is how we treat these
   outdated addresses.

   Discussion:  These addresses was removed from the current
      specification.  So, it should not be treated differently,
      especially if we think about future re-use of these address
      blocks.

      Considering the inappropriate use of these address blocks
      especially in outdated implementations and bad effects brought by
      them, however, it should be labeled differently from the
      legitimate address blocks.

2.1.4.  Renewed default policy table

   When we apply these changes, the default policy table will be:

         Prefix        Precedence Label
         ::1/128               60     0
         fc00::/7              50     1
         ::/0                  40     2
         ::ffff:0:0/96         30     3
         2002::/16             20     4
         2001::/32             10     5
         ::/96                  1    10
         fec::/16               1    11
         3ffe::/16              1    12

2.2.  Source address selection for multicast packet

   Source address selection for a multicast packet easily fails.  It is
   suggested to add some notes describing this issue of multicast
   address selection.

   As described in RFC 5220 Section 2.1.6, by default, ULA will be
   chosen for a multicast packet of any scope.

Internet-Draft               RFC3484 Revise               September 2010


   This issue cannot be solved by changing a RFC 3484 rule.  This is
   because, multicast and unicast have different sets of scope and it is
   site-dependent which unicast address scope is appropriate for the
   site's multicast scope.  Therefore, this issue can be solved, for
   example, by configuring the policy table per-site.

2.3.  RFC 3484 Section 6 Rule 9 and DNS round robin

   There was a discussion at v6ops and ietf@ietf.org mailing lists that
   the rule 9 of the destination address selection has a serious adverse
   effect on the round robin DNS technique.  RFC 3484 defines that the
   destination address selection rule 9 should be applied to both IPv4
   and IPv6, which spoils the DNS based load balancing technique that is
   widely used in the IPv4 Internet today.

   When the destination address acquired from one FQDN are two or more,
   the Rule 9 defines that the longest matching destination and source
   address pair should be chosen.  As in RFC 1794, the DNS based load
   balancing technique is achived by not re-ordering the destination
   addresses returned from the DNS server.  The Rule 9 defines
   deterministic rule for re-ordering at hosts, hence the technique of
   RFC 1794 is not available anymore.

   Regarding this problem, there was discussion in IETF and other places
   like below.
      http://drplokta.livejournal.com/109267.html
      http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf/current/msg51874.html
      http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/discuss/current/msg01035.html
      http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/dnsop/current/msg05847.html
      http://lists.debian.org/debian-ctte/2007/11/msg00029.html
      http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf/current/msg55991.html

   Discussion: The possible changes to RFC 3484 are as follows:

   1.  To delete Rule 9 completely.
   2.  To apply Rule 9 only for IPv6 and not for IPv4.  In IPv6,
       hiearchical address assignment is general principle, hence the
       longest matchin rule is beneficial in many cases.  In IPv4, as
       stated above, the DNS based load balancing technique is widely
       used.
   3.  To apply Rule 9 for IPv6 conditionally and not for IPv4.  When
       the length of matching bits of the destination address and the
       source address is longer than N, the rule 9 is applied.
       Otherwise, the order of the destination addresses do not change.
       The N should be configurable and it should be 32 by default.
       This is simply because the two sites whose matching bit length is
       longer than 32 are probably adjacent.

   Now that IPv6 PI address is admitted in some RIRs, hierachical
   address assignment is not maintained anymore.  It seems that the
   longest matching algorithm may not worth the adverse effect of
   disalbing the DNS based load balance technique.

2.4.  RFC 3484 Section 6 Rule 9 and local DNS round robin

   There is another issue related to the longest matching rule, which
   was found by Dave Thaler.  It is also malfunction of DNS round robin
   technique.  It is common for both IPv4 and IPv6.

   When a destination address DA, DB, and the source address of DA
   Source(DA) are on the same subnet and Source(DA) == Source(DB), DNS
   round robin load-balancing cannot function.  By considering prefix
   lengths that are longer than the subnet prefix, this rule establishes
   preference between addresses that have no substantive differences
   between them.  The rule functions as an arbitrary tie-breaker between
   the hosts in a round robin, causing a given host to always prefer a
   given member of the round robin.

   By limiting the calculation of common prefixes to a maximum length
   equal to the length of the subnet prefix of the source address, rule
   9 can continue to favor hosts that are nearby in the network
   hierarchy without arbitrarily sorting addresses within a given
   network.  This modification could be written as follows:

   Rule 9: Use longest matching prefix.

   When DA and DB belong to the same address family (both are IPv6 or
   both are IPv4): If CommonPrefixLen(DA & Netmask(Source(DA)),
   Source(DA)) > CommonPrefixLen(DB & Netmask(Source(DB)), Source(DB)),
   then prefer DA.  Similarly, if CommonPrefixLen(DA &
   Netmask(Source(DA)), Source(DA)) < CommonPrefixLen(DB &
   Netmask(Source(DB)), Source(DB)), then prefer DB.

2.5.  Deprecation of site-local unicast address

   RFC3484 contains a few "site-local unicast" and "fec::" description.
   It's better to remove examples related to site-local unicast address,
   or change examples to use ULA.  Possible points to be re-written are
   below.
      - 2nd paragraph in RFC 3484 Section 3.1 describes scope comparison
      mechanism.
      - RFC 3484 Section 10 contains examples for site-local address.

2.6.  Private IPv4 address scope

   As detailed in Remi's draft [I-D.denis-v6ops-nat-addrsel], when a
   host is in NATed site, and has a private IPv4 address and
   transitional addresses like 6to4 and Teredo, the host chooses
   transitional IPv6 address to access most of the dual-stack servers.

   This is because private IPv4 address is defined to be site-local
   scope, and as in RFC 3484, the scope matching rules (Rule 2) set
   lower priority for private IPv4 address.

   By changing the address scope of private IPv4 address to global, this
   problem can be solved.  Considering the widely deployed NAT with IPv4
   private address model, this change works in most of the cases.  If
   not, this behavior can be overridden by configuring policy table, or
   by configuring routing table on a host.

   Moreover, some modern OSs have already implemented this change.


3.  Conclusion

   This document lists several issues that should be included in the
   revision of RFC 3484, which are useful universally and do no harm in
   reasonable network environments.

   As the deployment of IPv6 progresses, the role of the address
   selection mechanism is getting more important.  This situation
   revealed several important issues about the current address selection
   rules.

   It is much anticipated to provide the solutions for these issues.
   Part of them, which are common issues for most of the reasonable
   environment, should be done by updating the default address selection
   rules as stated in this document, and the lest of them should be done
   on per site basis by configuring the policy table manually, or using
   the proposed policy updating mechanism.


4.  Security Considerations

   No security risk is found that degrades RFC 3484.


5.  IANA Considerations

   Address type number for the policy table may have to be assigned by
   IANA.
