                        "X-" Considered Harmful
              draft-saintandre-xdash-considered-harmful-00

Abstract

   Many application protocols use named parameters to represent data
   (for example, header fields in Internet mail messages and HTTP
   requests).  Historically, protocol designers and implementers have
   often differentiated between "official" and "unofficial" parameters
   by prefixing unofficial parameters with the string "X-".  This
   document argues that on balance the "X-" convention has more costs
   than benefits.

Internet-Draft            X- Considered Harmful                July 2010


1.  Argument

   Many application protocols use named parameters to represent data
   (for example, header fields in Internet mail messages and HTTP
   requests).  Historically, protocol designers and implementers have
   often differentiated between "official" and "unofficial" parameters
   by prefixing unofficial parameters with the string "X-" (often
   pronounced "ex dash").  This document argues that on balance the "X-"
   convention has more costs than benefits.

   The "X-" prefix has been in use since at least the publication of
   [RFC1154] in 1990, which set forth the following rule:

      Keywords beginning with "X-" are permanently reserved to
      implementation-specific use.  No standard registered encoding
      keyword will ever begin with "X-".

   This convention continued with various specifications for MIME
   [RFC2045] [RFC2046] [RFC2047], email [RFC2821] [RFC5321], HTTP
   [RFC2068] [RFC2616], and other technologies.

   The primary objections to discarding the "X-" convention are:

   o  Implementers are easily confused.  However, implementers already
      are quite flexible about using both prefixed and non-prefixed
      names based on what works in the field, so the distinction between
      de facto names (e.g., "X-foo") and de jure names (e.g., "foo") is
      meaningless to them.

   o  Collisions are undesirable.  However, names are cheap, so an
      implementation-specific name of "foo" does not prevent a standards
      development organization from issuing a similarly creative name
      such as "bar".

   The primary problem with the "X-" convention is that implementation-
   specific parameters have a tendency to seep into the standardization
   space, introducing the need for migration from the "X-" name to the
   standardized name.  Migration, in turn, introduces interoperability
   issues because older implementations will support only the "X-" name
   and newer implementations might support only the standardized name.
   To preserve interoperability, newer implementations simply support
   the "X-" name forever, which means that the unofficial name is a
   standard de facto (if not de jure).  We can see this phenomenon at
   work in [RFC2068]:

      For compatibility with previous implementations of HTTP,
      applications should consider "x-gzip" and "x-compress" to be
      equivalent to "gzip" and "compress" respectively.

   Therefore, segregating implementation-specific parameters into an
   "X-" ghetto has few if any benefits and at least one significant
   interoperability cost.  The practice is at best useless and at worst
   harmful.


2.  Security Considerations

   Interoperability and migration issues with security-critical
   paramaters can result in unnecessary vulnerabilities.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for the IANA.
