             The Unicode code points and IDNA - Unicode 6.0
                     draft-faltstrom-5892bis-01.txt

Abstract

   This document specifies IETF consensus related to and changes made to
   Unicode when version 6.0 was released on Oct 11 2011.  The consensus
   is that no update is needed to RFC 5892 based on the changes made in
   Unicode 6.0.

Internet-Draft               IDNA Codepoints               December 2010


1.  Introduction

   RFC 5892 [RFC5892] specifies an algorithm that based on The Unicode
   Standard [Unicode6] defines a derived property value.  Unicode 6.0
   has changed GeneralCategory to three codepoints that in turn imply
   the derived property value changes when the IDNA 2008 algorithm is
   applied.

1.1.  U+0CF1 KANNADA SIGN JIHVAMULIYA

   The GeneralCategory changes for this character from So to Lo.  This
   implies the derived property value will change from DISALLOWED to
   PVALID.

1.2.  U+0CF2 KANNADA SIGN UPADHMANIYA

   The GeneralCategory changes for this character from So to Lo.  This
   implies the derived property value will change from DISALLOWED to
   PVALID.

1.3.  U+19DA NEW TAI LUE THAM DIGIT ONE

   The GeneralCategory changes for this character from Nd to No.  This
   implies the derived property value will change from PVALID to
   DISALLOWED.


2.  IETF Consensus

   No change to RFC 5892 is needed based on the changes made in Unicode
   6.

   This consensus does not imply that no changes will be made to RFC
   5892 for all future updates of The Unicode Standard.

   The IETF will produce a new RFC of this type for every change of The
   Unicode Standard even when there are no changes being made to RFC
   5892, such as is the case for this document.


3.  IANA Considerations

3.1.  IDNA derived property value registry

   IANA is to update the derived property value registry according to
   RFC 5892 and property values in The Unicode Standard.

4.  Security Considerations

   When the algorithm presented in RFC 5892 is applied to Unicode 6.0
   the result will be different from when it is applied to Unicode 5.2
   for the three codepoints discussed in this document.  IETF consensus
   is though that the changes are minor, and that it is important IDNA
   standard is aligned with the Unicode Standard.
