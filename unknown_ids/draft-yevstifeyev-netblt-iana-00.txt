      Network Block Transfer Protocol (NETBLT) IANA Considerations
                   <draft-yevstifeyev-netblt-iana-00>

Abstract

   This document defined IANA considerations for Network Block Transfer
   Protocol (NETBLT). This protocol uses several values that are to be
   assigned by IANA, but no appropriate registries have been created so
   far. This document serves as a foundation for such registries. It
   updates RFC 998.

INTERNET DRAFT          IRTP IANA Considerations       December 28, 2010


1.  Introduction

   Network Block Transfer Protocol (NETBLT) was originally defined in
   RFC 998 [RFC998]. This protocol uses several values that are to be
   assigned by IANA (such as port numbers or packet types), but no
   appropriate registries have been created so far. This document serves
   as a foundation for such registries.

     Reference - the reference document, that defines the packet type.

2.3. Registration Procedures

   New assignments to 'NETBLT Packet Types' registry are to be made
   following the 'IETF Consensus' policies [RFC5226].

2.4. The Initial Contents of the Registry

   This section contains the initial contents of the 'NETBLT Packet
   Types' registry.

4.  Security Considerations

   The creation of these registries is not believed to introduce any new
   security issues to NETBLT not discussed in RFC 998 [RFC998].

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned the IP Protocol Number 30 to NETBLT.

   IANA has created the 'NETBLT Packet Types' and 'NETBLT Port Numbers'
   registries following Section 2 and Section 3 of this document.
