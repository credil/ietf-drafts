Abstract

   This document proposes an update to the Datagram Congestion Control
   Protocol (DCCP) transport protocol.  It describes a method that adds
   support to assist traversal of firewalls, Network Address Translators
   and other middleboxes that require simultaneous packets to be sent
   from the client and server to establish middlebox state.

Internet-Draft             DCCP NAT Traversal            November 2007


1.  Introduction

   UDP Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal is well understood and
   widely implemented.  NAT traversal for connection-oriented protocols,
   such as TCP, uses similar principles, but in some cases requires more
   complex and expensive solutions, such as dedicated relay servers.

   DCCP RFC4340 is both datagram-based and connection-oriented and thus
   NAT traversal of DCCP faces the same problems as TCP NAT traversal,
   without being able to reap the benefits of datagram-based NAT
   traversal as in UDP.  In addition, DCCP suffers from the problem that
   it can not exploit the use of simultaneous-open, a TCP-inherent
   characteristic which greatly simplifies TCP NAT traversal.

   After discussing the problem space for DCCP NAT traversal, this
   document proposes a solution to natively support NAT traversal in
   DCCP.  Among the discussed solutions, it requires the least changes.
   It is based on an indicator message.  A new DCCP packet type is
   introduced that is sent by the server and addressed to the expected
   client.  Since the use of this packet type is tied to an optional
   condition, it facilitates robust and native support for NAT
   traversal, while at the same time leaving the standard operational
   procedure of DCCP untouched.

1.1.  Scope of this document

   The solution proposed by this document assists in connection
   establishment when one or both peers are located behind a middlebox.
   While the solution is specifically targeted at NAT traversal, due to
   the similarity of involved principles, it may also be of similar use
   to the traversal of other types of middlebox, such as firewalls.

   For the scope of this document we consider traditional (outbound)
   types of NAT as defined in RFC2663 and further discussed in RFC3022.
   We consider NAT traversal to involve one or more NAT devices of this
   type in the path (i.e. hierarchies of nested NAT devices are
   possible).  It is assumed that all NATs in the path between endpoints
   are BEHAVE-compliant [DRAFT-APP].

   We consider NAT devices which provide a minimum of DCCP protocol
   support, in that layer-4 checksums can be updated to account for
   changes in the pseudo-header.  Since this document tackles an
   inherent problem of DCCP NAT traversal, we do not specify any further
   requirements for DCCP support in NAT devices.  These may be described
   by a separate document.

   This discussion is relevant to both client/server and peer-to-peer
   applications, such as VoIP, file sharing, or online gaming.  The

   update assists connections that utilise prior out-of-band signaling
   between the client and server (e.g. a well-known rendezvous server,
   RFC3261"/>, [H.323]) to notify both endpoints of the connection
   parameters [RFC3235] [DRAFT-APP].

1.2.  Scope of the problem to be tackled

   We refer to DCCP hosts located behind one or more NAT devices as
   having "private" addresses and to DCCP hosts located in the global
   address realm as having "public" addresses.

   We consider DCCP NAT traversal with regard to the following example
   scenarios:

   1.  Private client connects to public server

   2.  Public server connects to private client

   3.  Private client connects to private server

   A defining characteristic of traditional NAT devices RFC 3022 is that
   private hosts can connect to external hosts, but not vice versa.
   Hence the case (1) is always possible, whereas cases (2) and (3)
   require NAT traversal techniques and update of the DCCP specification
   (as described in this document).  For the discussion of 2/3 we leave
   aside the possibility of configuring static NAT address maps to allow
   outside hosts to connect into the private network.

1.3.  Discussion of traversal techniques for traditional NAT devices

   This section is a brief review of some existing techniques to
   establish connectivity across NAT devices, the basic idea being to
   make peer-to-peer sessions look like "outbound" sessions on each NAT
   device.

   The term 'hole punching' was coined in [FSK05] and refers to creating
   soft state in a traditional NAT device by initiating an outbound
   connection.  A well-behaved NAT can subsequently exploit this to
   allow a reverse connection back to the host in the private address
   realm.

   Often a rendezvous server, located in the public address realm, is
   used to enable clients to discover their NAT topology and the
   addresses of peers.

   The adaptation of the basic hole punching principle to TCP NAT
   traversal was introduced in section 4 of [FSK05] and relies on the
   simultaneous-open feature of TCP RFC0793.  UDP and TCP hole punching

   use nearly the same protocol, the main difference lies in the way the
   clients perform connectivity checks after obtaining the address pairs
   from the server: whereas in UDP a single socket is sufficient, TCP
   clients require several sockets for the same address/port tuple:

   o  a passive socket to listen for connectivity tests from peers and

   o  multiple active connections from the same address to test
      connectivity of other peers.

   The SYN sent out by client A to its peer B creates soft state in A's
   NAT.  At the same time, B tries to connect to A:

   o  if the SYN from B has left B's NAT before the arrival of A's SYN,
      both endpoints perform simultaneous open (4-way handshake of SYN/
      SYNACK);

   o  otherwise A's SYN may not enter B's NAT, which leads to B
      performing a normal open (SYN_SENT => ESTABLISHED) and A
      performing a simultaneous open (SYN_SENT => SYN_RCVD =>
      ESTABLISHED).

   In the latter case it is necessary that the NAT does not interfere
   with a RST segment (REQ-4 in [GBF+07]).  The simultaneous-open
   solution is convenient due to its simplicity, and is thus a preferred
   mode of operation in the TCP extension for ICE [Ros07a, sec. 2].

   The considerations in this section and the following subsections
   motivate a discussion as to whether and how the DCCP state machine
   can be enhanced to natively facilitate easier midbox traversal.

1.3.1.  Near Simultaneous-open of Connections

   Among the various TCP NAT traversal approaches, simultaneous-open
   suggests itself due to its simplicity [GF05], [DRAFT-APP].  A
   characteristic of simultaneous-open is that the clear distinction
   between client and server is erased: both sides enter through active
   (SYN_SENT) as well as passive (SYN_RCVD) states.  This characteristic
   is in conflict with several ideas underlying DCCP, as a clear
   separation between client and server has been one of the initial
   design decisions ([RFC4340], 4.6).  Furthermore, several mechanisms
   implicitly rely on clearly-defined client/server roles:





Fairhurst & Renker        Expires April 3, 2008                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft             DCCP NAT Traversal            November 2007


   o  Feature Negotiation: with few exceptions, almost all of DCCP's
      negotiable feature use the "server-priority" reconciliation rule
      (section 6.3.1 of RFC4340), whereby peers exchange their
      preference lists of feature values, and the server decides the
      outcome.

   o  Closing States: only servers may generate CloseReq packets (asking
      the peer to hold timewait state), while clients are only permitted
      to send Close or Reset packets to terminate a connection
      ([RFC4340], 8.3)

   o  Service Codes: passive sockets may associate multiple service
      codes, while active/connecting sockets must have exactly one
      associated service code ([RFC4340], 8.1.2).

   o  Init Cookies: may only be used by the server and on DCCP-Response
      packets ([RFC4340], 8.1.4).

   The latter two points are not obstacles per se, but hinder the
   transition from a passive to an active socket.  The assumption that
   "all DCCP hosts are clients", on the other hand, must be dismissed
   since it limits application programming.  As a consequence, retro-
   fitting simultaneous open into DCCP does not seem a very sensible
   idea.

1.3.2.  Role reversal

   After the simultaneous-open, one of the simplest TCP NAT traversal
   schemes involves role traversal ([Epp05] and [GTF04]), where a peer
   first opens an active connection for the single purpose of punching a
   hole in the firewall, and then reverts to a listening socket to
   accept incoming connections arriving via the new path.

   This solution has several disadvantages for DCCP: First, A DCCP
   client would be required to change its role from initially 'client'
   to 'server'.  This makes common server processing difficult: it is
   not clear how to assign multiple service codes (this would have to be
   done after the transition), a similar issue arises with Init Cookies.
   Further, the the client must not yet have started feature
   negotiation, since its choice of initial options may rely on its role
   (i.e. if an endpoint knows it is the server, it can make a priori
   assumptions about the preference lists of features it is negotiating
   with the client, thereby enforcing a particular policy).  We
   therefore do not recommend this approach for DCCP.

2.  Solution for DCCP NAT traversal

   This section revises packet processing for a DCCP Client and Server,
   to assists in connection establishment when one or both peers are
   located behind a middlebox.  The method does not employ role
   reversal; both endpoints start out with their designated roles, as
   specified in RFC4340.

2.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The document uses the terms and definitions provided in RFC4340.
   Familiarity with this specification is assumed, and note that
   [RFC4340], 3.1 states:

      "Each DCCP connection runs between two hosts, which we often name
      DCCP A and DCCP B. Each connection is actively initiated by one of
      the hosts, which we call the client; the other, initially passive
      host is called the server"

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.2.  DCCP-Listen Packet format

   The document updates DCCP by adding a new packet type: DCCP-Listen.

   The format of the packet is:

   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |          Source Port          |           Dest Port           |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Data Offset  | CCVal | CsCov |           Checksum            |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Res | Type  |X|             Sequence Number                   |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                         DCCP-Listen Packet Format

   The Reserved (Res) field is specified by RFC4340, and it successors.
   This document does not modify this definition.

   The Type field has the value XX-IANA-assigned-XX, which indicates
   that this is a DCCP-Listen packet.

   For this type of packet the following protocol fields MUST be set to



Fairhurst & Renker        Expires April 3, 2008                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft             DCCP NAT Traversal            November 2007


   zero:

      Data Offset (the connection has not been established)

      CCVal (the connection has not been established)

      CsCov (there is no payload)

      X (extended mode is not permitted)

      Sequence Number (no initial sequence number has been negotiated)

   A DCCP-Listen Packet MUST NOT include any DCCP options (since this
   packet does not modify the receiver protocol state) and MUST NOT
   include a payload field.

2.3.  Protocol method

   A server in the DCCP-Listen state ([RFC4340], 4.3) that passively
   listens, but does not fully specify the DCCP connection (assigned a
   pair of IP addresses, a pair of port numbers, and a Service Code)
   MUST use the method defined in RFC4340.  It does not send a DCCP-
   Listen packet (the corresponding endpoint is anyway unspecified).

   A server in DCCP-Listen state that has been bound to a fully-
   specified connection SHOULD use this method to send a single DCCP-
   Listen packet to the remote endpoint.  The server SHOULD treat ICMP
   error messages received in response to a DCCP-Listen packet as "soft
   errors", that do not abort a connection.

   A DCCP Client that implements RFC4340 and receives a DCCP-Listen
   would issue a DCCP-Reset (as it would for all unknown types of
   packet).

   This document updates RFC4340, so that a DCCP Client in any state
   that receives a DCCP-Listen packet, MUST silently discard the packet.
   The packet indicates only a willingness to accept a connection, if
   the client has already established a connection, this has no meaning.
   If the client is awaiting the response to a DCCP-Request, the client
   does not need to take specific action, and should continue to use the
   protocol method defined in RFC4340.

   Receipt of a DCCP-Listen packet by a server in the LISTEN state must
   necessarily lead to a Reset (here Code 7, "Connection Refused" would
   also make sense).  This is the expected behaviour for RFC4340.

Internet-Draft             DCCP NAT Traversal            November 2007


2.4.  Processing by Routers and Middleboxes

   Routers and Middleboxes need to forward DCCP packets.  This document
   does not specify the rules for forwarding these packets, but notes
   that DCCP-Listen packets do not require special treatment and should
   be forwarded end-to-end across the internet path.  Middle boxes may
   utilise the connection information (address, port, Service Code) to
   establish local forwarding state.

2.5.  Examples of use

   In the examples below, DCCP A is the client and DCCP B is the server.
   NAT/Firewall device NA is placed before DCCP A, and NAT/Firewall
   device NB is placed before DCCP B. Both NA and NB use a policy that
   permits DCCP packets to traverse the device for outgoing links, but
   only permit incoming DCCP packets when a previous packet has been
   sent for the same connection.

   DCCP A and DCCP B decide to communicate using some out of band
   mechanism, and the client and server are started.  DCCP A initiates a
   connection by sending a DCCP-Request.  DCCP B actively indicates its
   state by sending a Listen message.  This fulfils the requirement of
   punching a hole in NB so that DCCP A can retransmit the DCCP-Request
   and connect through it.

   DCCP A                                       DCCP B

                                  client

2.6.  Backwards Compatibility with RFC4340

   This does not modify communication for a server that implements
   RFC4340 and a client that implements the update described in this
   document.

   This does not also does not modify communication for any server that
   implements a passive open without fully binding the addresses, ports
   and service codes to be used.

   A change in the protocol exchange does occur when a server implements
   this update and binds to a client that implements RFC4340:

   If DCCP A and B were not behind NAT devices, the receipt of a DCCP
   Listen packet at A by a Server that implements RFC 43430 would lead
   to a DCCP-Reset (presumably Code 3, "No Connection", since Code 7,
   "Connection Refused" applies to DCCP-Requests only).  This would
   abort the connection.

   Since the out-going DCCP-Listen packet is expected to open a hole in
   the firewall, the same conclusion is expected when using NATs, as in
   the examples presented in the previous section.

   The authors do not however expect these issues to introduce practical
   deployment problems.

3.  Discussion of design decisions

   This section identifies a number of design decisions that were made
   in defining the current approach.

3.1.  Generation of Listen Packets

   Since DCCP-Listen packets solve a particular problem (NAT and/or
   firewall traversal), the generation of DCCP-Listen packets on passive
   sockets has been tied to a condition (i.e. the server is aware of the
   expected client connection request), so as to not interfere with the
   general case of "normal" DCCP connections.

   In the TCP world, the analogue is a transition from LISTEN to
   SYN_SENT by virtue of sending data: "A fully specified passive call
   can be made active by the subsequent execution of a SEND" ([RFC0793],
   3.8).

   Unlike TCP, this proposal does not perform a role change from passive
   to active.  Like TCP, we require as condition for the generation of
   DCCP-Listen packets that the listening socket for DCCP B be fully
   specified, i.e. both source address/port and destination address/port
   are set.  In the above case, this would for example mean that DCCP B
   opens a passive socket listening on DCCP B's local address/port and
   bound to DCCP A's public address/port (as assigned on the public side
   of NA).

   If this condition were considered too weak (or introduces
   unacceptable backwards compatibility issues with RFC4340), it could
   be coupled with a socket option to trigger generation of DCCP-Listen
   packets on fully specified passive sockets.

3.2.  Repetition of Listen Packets

   Section 4.3 of RFC4340 defines the LISTEN state as:

      "Represents server sockets in the passive listening state.  LISTEN
      and CLOSED are not associated with any particular DCCP
      connection."

   This document revises this definition by establishing a specific case
   where a server that has been bound to a fully-specified DCCP
   connection (assigned a pair of IP addresses, a pair of port numbers,
   and a Service Code).

   In the current revision of this document, this is represented as an
   additional transition, but the authors also acknowledge the
   possibility of introducing a new state.  This state would allow a

   LISTEN packet to be re-issued periodically to refresh firewall state.
   This approach would ad robustness to the proposed mechanism, but has
   the disadvantage that the DCCP-Listen packets could then contribute
   unwanted load in a mis-configured network and procedures may be
   needed to limit the rate and number of packets sent.

3.3.  Client/Server relationship

   The DCCP protocol differentiates between client and server functions
   ([RFC4340, section 1.2.1).  It is therefore necessary that peer-to-
   peer connections are able to differentiate the two roles, which may
   be need to be signaled to the DCCP hosts as part of the address/port
   setup.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires IANA action by allocation of a new Packet Type
   from the IANA Packet Types Registry.  The Registry entry is to
   reference this document.  This allocation requires IESG review and
   approval and standards-track IETF RFC publication.

5.  Security Considerations

   The method specified in this document exposes the state of a DCCP
   server that has been explicitly configured to accept a connection
   from a client.  This requires prior out of band signaling between the
   client and server (e.g. via SIP) to establish this state.  The method
   generates a packet addressed to the expected client.

   This increases the vulnerability of the DCCP host by revealing which
   ports are in a passive listen state to the expected client (this
   information is not encrypted, and therefore could be seen on the path
   to the client through the network).  We do not believe this change
   significantly increases the complexity or vulnerability of a DCCP
   implementation that conforms to RFC 4340.

   Reception of a DCCP-Listen packet would trigger a DCCP-Reset in
   RFC4340, but is ignored by the method described in this protocol.
   This does not introduce new security concerns.
