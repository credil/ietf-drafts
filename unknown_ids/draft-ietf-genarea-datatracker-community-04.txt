Requirements for Draft Tracking by the IETF Community in the Datatracker
              draft-ietf-genarea-datatracker-community-04

Abstract

   The document gives a set of requirements for extending the IETF
   Datatracker to give individual IETF community members, including the
   IETF leadership, easy methods for tracking the progress of the
   Internet Drafts of interest to them.

Status of this Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list of current Internet-
   Drafts is at http://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

   This Internet-Draft will expire on July 21, 2011.

Internet-Draft     Datatracker Community Tracking Reqs      January 2011


1.  Introduction

   The IETF Datatracker is used by many IETF community members to find
   the status of Internet Drafts (I-Ds) and view drafts that meet
   particular criteria.  The current Datatracker, found at
   <https://datatracker.ietf.org/>, allows anyone to search for active
   I-Ds and get a list of drafts matching the given criteria.  (The
   Datatracker also allows for searching RFCs and expired I-Ds, but
   those are not relevant to this discussion.)

   Users can search in the Datatracker by the filename of the draft,
   words in the draft's title, author, associated Working Group (WG) or
   IETF area, the responsible Area Director (AD), or IESG status.  The
   returned list of drafts includes five columns: draft filename (with
   an active link to an HTMLized version of the draft maintained by the
   IETF tools team), the draft's title, the date it was submitted, its
   status in the IETF process, and the responsible AD (if any).  For
   example, the output of a search in the current Datatracker can be
   seen at <http://imgur.com/snfyl.png>.

   Instead of using the search capability of the Datatracker to manually
   find I-Ds of interest, users might want to create a list of drafts
   that they normally follow.  Some users will want to keep their list
   to themselves, but others will want to allow others to view their
   list.

   Different users in the IETF community will have different ways that
   they want to get information on draft updates and status.  Many users
   will want to be notified immediately, such as through an Atom feed
   (see [RFC4287]) or automatically-generated email.  Many users will
   want to only find out about updates when they go to a web page.  Many
   users might want to get the data for a list as input to other tools.
   And, of course, some users will want all three.  All of these desires
   are related to the overall desire to track drafts through their
   lifecycle.

1.1.  Usage Scenarios

   The main motivation for these proposed changes to the Datatracker is
   to allow a variety of potential users to be able to track drafts and
   thus be better able to see when important events happen.  A few
   examples include:

   o  A WG chair might want to keep a list of all the drafts from other
      WGs that relate to active drafts in his or her WG.

   o  That same WG chair might want to help WG members be able to follow
      the same drafts that he or she is following.

Internet-Draft     Datatracker Community Tracking Reqs      January 2011


   o  Someone who cares about an established topic such as the DNS may
      want to follow the various drafts that might make changes to the
      DNS.  This would include not only drafts that are in the many WGs
      that directly are changing the DNS (DNSEXT, DNSOP, BEHAVE, and so
      on), but also individual submissions, IAB drafts, and even IRTF
      research.

   o  Developers who are not active in the IETF process might want to
      lightly follow drafts on a particular topic to watch for things
      that might affect their implementations.

   o  An IETF "regular" might want to follow parts of the process by
      focusing on all the drafts that are being shepherded by a
      particular Area Director.

1.2.  Context for This Document

   This document describes the requirements for extending the
   Datatracker for such capabilities.  When complete, this document may
   be used to issue an RFP for the design and development of these
   enhancements to the Datatracker.  This document was prepared at the
   request of the IAOC.

   Some of the requirements in this document are listed as "later
   requirements".  This means that these requirements might not be part
   of the first RFP for adding these enhancements.

   The statement of work that led to this document says "The tools that
   will eventually be provided to individuals in the community include":

   o  the ability to create one or more (possibly large) lists of I-Ds
      that they want to follow

   o  the ability to get notifications when individual drafts from a
      list changes state

   o  the ability to see all of the state changes that have occurred on
      all the drafts in a list over a specified range of dates

   o  the ability to set the granularity of the changes (such as "every
      change", "just approvals and publication", and so on)

   o  the ability to organize their views of a list in many fashions
      that would be useful to different types of community members

   o  the ability to share and merge lists with other community members

   Note that [RFC2026] describes the process that Internet Drafts go



Hoffman                   Expires July 21, 2011                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     Datatracker Community Tracking Reqs      January 2011


   through before they either become RFCs or are abandoned.  The
   Datatracker does not control this process: instead, it simply reports
   on the current state of individual drafts as they go through the
   process.

   During the early discussion of these requirements, some community
   members proposed that it would be very useful to track other types of
   documents, such as WG charters.  Appendixes A through D list these
   proposals.  It is not clear currently if those sections will be part
   of the initial deployment of the requirements in the main body of
   this document.

1.3.  Definitions Used in This Document

   A "user" is an individual person who is member of the IETF community.

   A "list" is an unordered set of Internet Drafts and groups of
   Internet Drafts.  Lists are specified by users.  In some cases, the
   authors are role-based, such as a WG chair being the specifier of the
   list associated with that WG.

   An "attribute" is a feature of a draft, such as its filename, its
   current state in the IETF process, and so on.  Attributes are usually
   displayed as columns in the Datatracker.

   A "row" is a set of attributes about a single draft that is displayed
   in the Datatracker.

   A "significant change in status" is all approvals and disposition of
   the draft.  Assuming that the changes to the Datatracker specified in
   [WGSTATES] and [ALTSTREAMS] are made, "all approvals" means the
   following:

   o  IETF stream: the WG states "Adopted by a WG", "In WG Last Call",
      "WG Consensus: Waiting for Write-up", "Parked WG document", and
      "Dead WG document"; the IESG states "Publication Requested", "In
      Last Call", and "IESG Evaluation"

   o  IAB stream: "Active IAB Document", "Community Review", and "Sent
      to the RFC Editor"

   o  IRTF stream: "Active RG Document", "In RG Last Call", "Awaiting
      IRSG Reviews", "In IESG Review", "Sent to the RFC Editor", and
      "Document on Hold Based On IESG Request"

   o  ISE stream: "Submission Received", "In ISE Review", "In IESG
      Review", "Sent to the RFC Editor", and "Document on Hold Based On
      IESG Request"

Internet-Draft     Datatracker Community Tracking Reqs      January 2011


   o  All streams: in addition to the above, the disposition states
      "Approved", "RFC Published", and "Dead" are also included

1.4.  Expected user interactions

   When a user wants to follow a group of drafts, he or she goes to the
   Datatracker and creates a new list.  The requirements for lists are
   given in Section 2.1.  After a list is created, the user has three
   ways that he or she might see when drafts in the list are updated:

   o  By going to the Datatracker page for the list (see Section 2.3)

   o  By subscribing to the Atom feed for the list (see Section 2.2.2)
      in a feed reader that automatically fetches updates

   o  By subscribing to the mail stream for the list (see Section 2.2.3)
      and reading the stream in their mail reader

1.5.  Discussion of These Requirements

   This document is being discussed on the datatracker-rqmts@ietf.org
   mailing list.  For more information, see
   <https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/datatracker-rqmts>.

   There will probably be virtual interim meetings to discuss this
   document in early 2011.


2.  Requirements for Tools Features

   This section defines the requirements for the tool described earlier
   in this document.  The eventual tool, if implemented, may have more
   features than are listed here; however, before this document is
   finished, it should contain as many requirements as possible upon
   which the IETF community can agree.

2.1.  Lists

2.1.1.  Requirement: Lists of drafts can be large

   An active IETF participant might want to follow the status of
   hundreds of drafts.  For example, some ADs have 100 drafts in their
   area, and they may also want to follow drafts outside their area that
   affect documents in their area.

Internet-Draft     Datatracker Community Tracking Reqs      January 2011


2.1.2.  Requirement: Every Datatracker user can create a list

   When a user gets a Datatracker account, that account comes with an
   empty list pre-defined.  The list can nomrally be modified only by
   the owner of the account, although the Secretariat can also modify
   the list as part of its support role for the Datatracker.

   In order for this requirement to be met, it must be easy for any
   community member to get a Datatracker account.  Account setup must
   not involve any direct action on the part of the Secretariat.
   However, the Secretariat will be responsible for support of
   Datatracker accounts (lots passwords, odd interactions, and so on),
   so this addition of more Datatracker accounts will potentially
   increase the amount of work the Secretariat must do.

   The only person who can edit the contents of a private list is the
   person who knows the password to the account with which the list is
   associated.

2.1.3.  Requirement: Read-only views of private lists can be made
        visible to others

   Some users will want to make available a read-only view of their
   list.  Each private list will have a URL that leads to the
   Datatracker view of the list; that URL must be able to be safely
   shared with others.  In this case, "safely" means "will not help
   others be able to edit the list".  Similarly, the Atom feed
   associated with a private list should be able to be safely shared
   with others>

2.1.4.  Requirement: The Datatracker must support optional publicly-
        readable lists for WGs and Area Directors

   It is common in the IETF for users to follow the work of an entire
   WG, not just individual drafts within a WG.  It is also very common
   that some work that is related to a WG happens outside the WG, either
   in other WGs or as individual efforts.  Many WG chairs monitor this
   outside-the-WG activity for various reasons.

   A smaller number of community members to follow an entire Area's
   worth of topics.  Again, these topics often happen within the WGs of
   an area, but not always; for example, some topics related to the
   Security Area happen in WGs in the Applications Area.

   Because of this, it would be useful for community members to be able
   to find a list which corresponds to the WGs or Areas in which they
   are interested.  The WG lists could be maintained by the WG chairs;
   the Area lists would likely be maintained by the ADs.  Note that such



Hoffman                   Expires July 21, 2011                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft     Datatracker Community Tracking Reqs      January 2011


   lists are not mandatory; for example, a WG chair might not choose to
   maintain such a list for a WG whose topic is extremely broad.

   Both Working Group chairs and Area Directors currently already have
   Datatracker accounts, so fulfilling this requirement only involves
   associating those accounts with the role that controls the list.

   Proposed later requirements include having the Datatracker list all
   of the publicly-readable lists (or certainly at least the ones
   associated with IETF activities), and having links from WG pages in
   Datatracker to the publicly-readable lists maintained by the WG
   chairs.

2.1.5.  Requirement: Specifying the drafts that are in a list must be
        simple

   When a user creates a new list, it must be easy to add individual
   drafts to the list.  This could be done using the Datatracker's
   current search facility, and simply adding a "add to list" option for
   Further, when editing an existing list, it must be easy to add
   additional drafts, and it must be easy to remove drafts from a list.

2.1.6.  Requirement: Adding groups of drafts to a list by attribute must
        be simple

   Drafts have many attributes, and some users might want to follow all
   of the drafts that have a particular attribute.  Some, but not all,
   attributes have values that make sense in specifying lists.  It
   should be easy to add each of the following attributes when adding to
   or editing a list:

   o  All drafts associated with an individual WG

   o  All drafts associated with all WGs in an individual Area

   o  All drafts with a particular responsible AD

   o  All drafts with a particular author

   o  All drafts with a particular document shepherd

   o  All drafts that have a reference to a particular RFC

   o  All drafts that have a reference to a particular draft

   o  All drafts that are referenced by a particular RFC





Hoffman                   Expires July 21, 2011                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft     Datatracker Community Tracking Reqs      January 2011


   o  All drafts that are referenced by a particular draft

   o  All drafts that contain a particular text string

   These attributes are dynamic, and thus the list of drafts that have a
   particular attribute will change after the user adds that attribute
   to a list.  The Datatracker should update lists with dynamic
   attributes as often as is sensible for the server environment, such
   as once an hour or more.

   Note that some of these attributes are derived by programs created by
   the IETF Tools Team that parse drafts and are therefore inherently
   not completely reliable.

2.1.7.  Tombstone: lists dynamically including other lists

   Earlier versions of this draft had a requirement that lists needed to
   be able to include other lists.  While this may still be desired, it
   was decided that implementing this in a safe and understandable way
   would be too difficult.  Later versions of the Datatracker might
   include this feature.

2.1.8.  Later Requirement: Users can add comments to say why they added
        a draft or group

   In public lists, it might be useful for someone to be able to
   understand why particular drafts and/or groups are added.  Allowing
   the user who put together the list to add a comment field would help
   someone else see the motivation.

2.1.9.  Requirement: These extensions must not make the Datatracker take
        up too many resources

   Currently, the only state that the Datatracker keeps for its users is
   a very small set of attributes assigned to a username-password pair.
   The extensions described here will cause the Datatracker to need to
   keep more information, namely lists.  Each list might have additional
   associated state as well.  This could lead to the Datatracker needing
   a larger amount of storage and other resources.  When this document
   is near completion, it would probably be good to list exactly which
   new state will be kept on the Datatracker server.

   In order to reduce the chance that these extensions would strain the
   Datatracker, some sort of denial-of-service prevention should be used
   when the extensions are added.  A later requirement might be to cull
   lists if it seems that storing them on the Datatracker is taking too
   many resources.  The Datatracker can periodically send mail to the
   user reminding them to delete lists that are no longer needed.



Hoffman                   Expires July 21, 2011                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft     Datatracker Community Tracking Reqs      January 2011


   Culling presents a problem, however, for user-based lists that are
   made public.  The creator of a list might no longer be using it, but
   others might be.  Thus, it is likely that the Datatracker needs to be
   be able to maintain lists long-term even if their creators are no
   longer using them.

2.1.10.  Requirement: Private information must not be exposed in lists

   Any private information in the Datatracker must be excluded from any
   displays of the lists or streams created in this document.  This
   private information includes private notes in the IESG balloting for
   a draft, and probably other data that currently is restricted to
   being seen by certain members of the IETF leadership.

2.2.  Notifications

2.2.1.  Requirement: Users can be notified when a draft changes status

   Some users do not want to go to the Datatracker's display page to
   find out when a draft has been updated.  Instead, they want to be
   notified immediately after the draft is changed.  The Datatracker
   needs to support this type of immediate notification, where
   "immediate" means "within an hour of a change to any draft in the
   list".  This requirement can be met with Atom feeds and mail streams,
   as described in the next two sections.

   The Datatracker might create a generic "notifications engine" that
   can be used to generate the Atom feeds and mail streams.  This engine
   can then be used to later add other notification types, such as a
   Jabber feed.

2.2.2.  Requirement: Every list has Atom feeds associated with it

   The list will have two Atom feeds that are generated from the changes
   to the list: one for every change in status, and another for
   significant change of status.  Each Atom feed will have a stable URL
   that can be used by feed readers.

   Many IETF users are already using Atom feeds created by the IETF
   Tools Team for individual drafts.  Using the new feeds for lists
   described here will allow them to have better selection capabilities
   to reduce the number of feeds they need to follow.

2.2.3.  Requirement: Every list has mail streams associated with it

   A user can subscribe to two email streams that are generated from the
   changes to the list: one for every change in status, and another for
   significant change of status.

Internet-Draft     Datatracker Community Tracking Reqs      January 2011


   Note that the mail streams are for each change; they are not batched
   (such as one message per day).  Users who want less frequent but
   batched notifications need to use the Atom feeds instead of the mail
   streams.

2.2.4.  Requirement: Notifications need to specify which list caused the
        notification

   Users might have feeds and/or subscriptions to multiple lists.  In
   order to disambiguate duplicate notifications from multiple lists,
   the body of the message in the Atom feed or mail stream needs to say
   which list generated the notification.  (Ideally, a user who wants
   notifications will make one list based on multiple lists, but if they
   subscribe to multiple lists, this requirement will at least suggest
   to them that they want to limit their overlapping subscriptions.)

2.2.5.  Later Requirement: The tool must have instructions on how to use
        it Atom feeds

   Even though Atom feeds have been around for years, they are new to
   many Internet users, and even experienced users only know how to use
   them in limited ways.  The Datatracker should have at least a few
   paragraphs explaining how the Atom feeds that it provides can be used
   in different tools such as dedicated feed readers, online feed-
   display services, and so on.

2.3.  Display in the Datatracker

2.3.1.  Requirement: Users can define how the rows are sorted in a
        display

   There are many ways that a user might want to see the Datatracker's
   HTML view of a list.  For example, a user might want to normally see
   it in alphabetical order by the drafts' filenames, but after the user
   is of the net for a week, he or she might want to see the list in
   order of changes of status so that those drafts changed recently
   appear at the top of the list.

   The default is to first list the groups first in alphabetical order
   by group name, then individual drafts in alphabetical order by draft
   filename.  When displaying a list, the Datatracker should allow easy
   sorting of the drafts with the following collation orders:

   o  Alphabetical order by group name followed by individual drafts
      (default)

   o  Alphabetical by draft filename




Hoffman                   Expires July 21, 2011                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft     Datatracker Community Tracking Reqs      January 2011


   o  Alphabetical by draft title

   o  Alphabetical by associated WG

   o  Date of publication of current version of the draft

   o  Date of most recent change of status of any type

   o  Date of most recent significant change of status

   In displays, a particular draft should only included once; for
   example, if someone manually adds draft-ietf-cuteacronym-sometopic to
   his list and also specifies that all drafts from the "cuteacronym" WG
   are included in the list, that draft should only appear once in the
   display.  The column saying which included list(s) contain this draft
   helps alleviate this loss of information.

   The user might also want to group the files using the groupings in
   the list, such as "all drafts from this WG" and "all drafts that
   contain this word in the title".

   The Datatracker should save the last-chosen sorting for display with
   the definition of the list.

2.3.2.  Requirement: Users can choose which attributes to display

   There are many attributes that might be displayed, and different
   users will have different information that they want to see.  Also,
   users will have different display technologies: someone might
   normally use a web browser on a large screen, but at other times use
   the browser on their phone.

   Choosing which attributes should be displayed should be simple for
   the user.  The Datatracker should save the last-chosen set of
   attributes for display with the definition of the list.  The default
   is to display is draft filename, draft title, date of current draft,
   status in stream process, associated WG or RG, whether it was changed
   within the last 7 days, and included list(s) which contain this
   draft.

   The Datatracker should support display of the following attributes:

   o  Draft filename

   o  Draft title

   o  Date of current draft




Hoffman                   Expires July 21, 2011                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft     Datatracker Community Tracking Reqs      January 2011


   o  Status in the IETF process

   o  Associated WG or RG

   o  Associated AD, if any

   o  Changed within the last 1 day

   o  Changed within the last 2 days

   o  Changed within the last 7 days

   There is some leeway for how the Datatracker might display these
   attributes.  For example, the "changed within" attributes might be
   shown with a check mark or a colored box.

2.3.3.  Requirement: Users can flag drafts with dates in the future

   When tracking drafts, some users want to be able to say "tell me if
   this draft has not changes state by a particular date" such as when a
   draft is starting a two-week last call or a draft author has promised
   a new version by the end of the week.  This feature gives the user a
   "dashboard" style capability.

   For each draft in a list, the user should be able to set one date-
   based deadline.  When using the display version of the Datatracker,
   if that date has passed and no change in status happened between the
   time that the user set the deadline and the set date, the Datatracker
   will highlight the deadline in red.  It must also be easy to remove
   these deadlines.

2.3.4.  Requirement: Users can specify highlighting of drafts with
        recent changes

   The Datatracker cannot easily keep track of when a user last looked
   at the page for a particular list.  Thus, it instead needs to let a
   user say which range of dates they are most interested in.  To that
   end, the user needs to be able to easily specify the amount of time
   they consider recent, either as "the past nnn hours", "the past nnn
   days", or "since this particular date".

2.4.  File Output

2.4.1.  Requirement: Users can get their current list as a single file

   Some users have their own tools for displaying and otherwise
   processing lists of drafts.  To make this easier, users should be
   able to get a machine-parsable file that has a well-known format and



Hoffman                   Expires July 21, 2011                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft     Datatracker Community Tracking Reqs      January 2011


   syntax that contains all the data that was used to create the current
   display.  The order of the records in the file is not important
   because it is assumed that the user's program will sort the results
   themselves.  All attributes will be included because it is assumed
   that the user's programs will only deal with the ones the care about.

   When a list is marshaled into a data file, each record in the file
   format represents a single draft.  In a file, a particular draft is
   only included once; for example, if someone manually adds
   draft-ietf-cuteacronym-sometopic to his list and also specifies that
   all drafts from the "cuteacronym" WG are included in the list, that
   draft only appears once.

   This feature will allow anyone to create mash-ups of their own and
   create their own web sites based on the IETF data.  This is
   significantly easier than adding features to the Datatracker, and is
   able to cater to narrower audiences.

   The format of the file will be XML or JSON or tab-separated fields in
   a text file.  The decision on which format is supported will be based
   on the desires of the community while discussing this document.
   (Imagine how much fun that will be!)  Regardless of the format
   chosen, a syntax will need to be specified.


3.  IANA Considerations

   None.


4.  Security Considerations

   A tool for tracking the status of Internet Drafts can affect the
   privacy of its users.  The requirements for privacy of the
   Datatracker views are discussed earlier in the document.

   Web applications, particularly those that store data on a web server,
   are a common source of security issues such as cross-site scripting
   attacks.  The tool described in this document might also use access
   control for lists, and access control and authentication also cause
   security issues if not implemented properly.

Appendix A.  Possible Tracking of Non-draft Documents

   It is not at all clear if any of these will be a requirement, a later
   requirement, or a non-requirement.  Further, even if one or more of
   these non-draft items is made a requirement, it is not clear whether
   they will be included in the same lists with drafts.  That is, if
   tracking RFC status changes are considered a requirement, it is not
   clear whether a user would include the RFCs in a list that also
   contains draft, or whether they would need to create two lists, one
   for drafts and one for RFCs.

A.1.  Tracking RFC Status Changes and Errata

   The contents of RFCs never change after they are published.  However,
   that does not mean that nothing alters the meaning of the RFC.  In
   specific, an RFC can be updated or obsoleted by another RFC; also,
   errata can be made against RFCs.  A user who cares about the RFC
   might want to know when these changes are made.

Internet-Draft     Datatracker Community Tracking Reqs      January 2011


   Currently, the only way for the Datatracker to see these changes is
   by polling structured files on the RFC Editor site and parsing them.

A.2.  Tracking WG Charter Changes

   It will soon be easier to track changes in WG charters and
   milestones; see [CHARTERTOOL] for more information.  Someone
   subscribing to the stream for a WG would be able to see each of these
   changes.  With the expected changes, the Datatracker would be able to
   update WGs in a list without any polling.

A.3.  Tracking IANA Registry Changes

   Developers may need to get values from IANA registries for their
   software/hardware implementations.  They might want to know when the
   registry changes, such as additional entries or updates to current
   entries.  Thus, being able to be notified when a registry changes
   would be valuable to them.

   Adding this functionality may be tricky for some registries.  For
   example, if a developer cared about DKIM signature tags, they would
   have to subscribe to
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/dkim-parameters/> which (currently)
   covers a handful of registries, all related to DKIM.  Thus, a change
   to the DKIM hash algorithms would trigger a message showing that the
   registry had changed, even though the DKIM signature tags registry
   had not.

A.4.  Tracking Changes in the Liason Statement Directory

   Users might want to know when a new liaison statement is sent by the
   IETF, or when one is received by the IETF.

A.5.  Tracking Changes in Documents Outside the IETF Sphere

   Users might want to track documents that relate to IETF activities
   but are produced by other standards development organizations (SDOs)
   such as the W3C, the IEEE, the Unicode Consortium, the ITU, and
   others.  In order for the tracker to track these documents, it would
   need to poll occasionally and possibly scrape listings from HTML.


Appendix B.  Some Known Open Issues

   This list is mostly meant to remind the author of topics that need to
   be updated in future versions of the document, and to spur readers to
   think of even more open issues.

   o  When an AD agrees to sponsor an individual submission, does the
      Datatracker consider that draft associated with the AD?  If not,
      that needs to be dealt with here.


Appendix C.  Ideas that Might Be Implemented Later

   The following are ideas for the new tool that are not currently being
   considered for the first round of development, but are being
   documented for possible future use.  Items here might move between
   this list and the list of requirements that are expected to be in the
   first round.

   o  The normal Datatracker display could have a button to add a
      particular draft to the user's personal list.

   o  Allow each user to determine what "significant change in status"
      is for the list they create.  This could be done by a series of
      check boxes for every possible status change.

   o  A list creator can add a list-level comment about who might be
      interested in following the list.

   o  If the agendas for an upcoming meeting are scraped for draft
      names, it would be possible to add an attribute to a draft that
      lists that WG agenda(s) on which it appears.

   o  In the section on "Adding groups of drafts to a list by
      attribute", add an attribute for "all drafts that are referenced
      by any draft in a particular list".

   o  Make it possible to add all drafts that have a certain section to
      a list (non-trivial IANA considerations, ASN.1 modules in
      appendicies, ...).


Appendix D.  Differences Between -03 and -04

   Removed the "early" note from the intro.

   Added a requirement on private data not being exposed.

   Added an appendix of ideas that could possibly be added later.

   Removed the "legal issues for user data" open issue because no one
   listed any.

   Moved many open issues to the "possibly later" list.
