Abstract

   This document proposes a modification to the 6rd deployment model for
   IPv6.  This model extends existing access tunnels beyond an operator-
   owned gateway collocated with the operator's IPv4 network edge to the
   Border Router.  This modification makes it unnecessary to provide
   IPv4 routes to IPv6 UEs.  The gateway serves as an aggregation point
   for IPv4 routing.

1.  Introduction

   6rd [RFC5969] provides a transition tool for connecting IPv6 devices
   across an IPv4 network to an IPv6 network, at which point the packets
   can be routed natively.  The network topology is shown in Figure 1.

      | Customer LAN |     |                 |      |         |
      +--------------+     +-----------------+      +---------+

                     Figure 1: 6rd Deployment Topology

   In Figure 1, the CE is the customer edge router.  It is provisioned
   with a delegated IPv6 prefix, but also with an IPv4 address so that
   it is reachable through the IPv4 network.  As a consequence, the
   routers in the IPv4 network have to carry a route for every customer
   site.  In a large network, this can lead to very large routing
   tables.  The IPv6 prefix of all the users are the same for one ISP,
   which is less than 32 bits.

   In 6RD [RFC5969], the IPv4 address of CPE included in the host's IPv6
   address is allocated by ISP.  Every host needs an IPv4 address (even
   if the terminals in the Customer Network are all IPv6) which may
   bring great pressure of IPv4 address shortage for the operators with
   the number of broadband subscribers increasing at high speed.


2.  An Alternative Proposal

   To release the pressure of IPv4 address shortage, some ISP starts to
   provide IPv6 access.  The backbone network will first support IPv6 in
   this case.  The metro network is not easily to be upgraded to support
   IPv6 since many devices need to be modified and there may be some
   impact to the existing services.  This proposal only modifies the IP
   edge device to provide IPv6 access without changing other network
   devices in the metro network.

   The number of IPv4 routes can be drastically reduced if the customer
   end of the tunnel is moved to the gateway between IPv6 on the
   customer side and the IPv4 network.  There is only one tunnel
   initiated from each Gateway to the Border Router which greatly
   reduces the tunnel numbers.  There are two possible deployment
   scenarios.  The first, shown in Figure 2, collocates the gateway with

   the IP edge, with the IPv4 network immediately beyond.  This is the
   typical placement of the Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) in a fixed
   broadband network, where the metro network beyond the BNG is IPv4.
   Transport between the customer site and the gateway is over layer 2.

           +-------+     +-------------------+      +---------+

              Figure 2: Gateway-Initiated 6rd At the IP Edge

   An alternative deployment assumes that the IP network closest to the
   customer site is IPv6, but an IPv4 network further out has to be
   traversed to reached further IPv6 networks.  This is shown in
   Figure 3.  In terms comparable to Figure 2, in this case the metro
   network is running IPv6, the core network is running IPv4, and the
   Border Router is needed to pass onto adjacent IPv6 metro networks or
   IPv6 networks belonging other operators.  This deployment has a
   relatively straightforward solution and is out of scope of the
   present document.

   In both deployment scenarios, the Gateway serves as an IPv4
   aggregation point for all of the customer sites it serves.

2.1.  Prefix Delegation

   Referring back to Figure 2, prefix assignment to the customer
   equipment occurs in the normal fashion through the Gateway/IP edge,
   using either PPPoEv6 or DHCPv6.  For the bridged mode CPE, the prefix
   is delegated in the last 64 bits of IPCPv6 message in PPPoE method or
   acquired through DHCP Server with the BNG's IPv4 address (or IPv4
   address designated by BNG) included in the last 64 bits of the
   delegated 128 bits IPv6 address.  When the CPE is in routed mode,
   there are two ways to delegate the prefix.  The first is to allocate
   128 bits IPv6 address to the host and CPE should have the IPv4
   address in advance.  Another way is to allocate prefix only to the
   host and the host needs to know the BNG's IPv4 address (or the IPv4
   address designated by BNG).  In spirit of 6rd, the prefixes contain
   the 32-bit IPv4 address assigned to the gateway.  An example format
   (derived from the IPv6 unicast address structure [RFC3587]) is shown
   in Figure 4.

   +----------------------------------------------------------+
   |001 | Global IPv6    | Subnet | Indic | IPv4 addr |  Host |
   |    | routing prefix |        |       |           |   ID  |
   +----+----------------+--------+-------+-----------+-------+
   | 3  |    45 bits     |16 bits | N bits|  32 bits  | 32 - N|
   +----------------------------------------------------------+

             Figure 4: Suggested Customer Site Address Format

   The first 64 bits in Figure 4 are as defined in [RFC3587].  The N-bit
   Indicator field which comes next is defined for operator use.  The
   operator will assign a specific indicator value to designate the
   customer site address format which includes the IPv4 address of the
   Gateway/IP edge or the IPv4 address designated by the Gateway/IP edge
   as shown above.  Other indicator values could be used to designate
   alternative address formats.  The indicator field is followed by the
   32-bit IP address of the Gateway/IP edge (e.g., the BNG) and then by
   a host identifier that uses the remaining 32 - N bits.

   If prefix delegation to the customer site is a concern, one could use
   the format shown in [RFC5969].  However, this requires a much-
   shortened global IPv6 routing prefix, and hence a much higher degree
   of IPv6 route aggregation.  That may or may not be practical for a
   given operator.

   With the present proposal, there is no concern about DHCPv6 lease
   times.  The Gateway/IP edge will be assigned a permanent IPv4
   address, using the operator's normal network provisioning processes.

2.2.  Troubleshooting and Traceability

   The first paragraph of Section 5 of [RFC5969] on traceability applies
   equally well to the present proposal.  The second paragraph, on
   support of anycast addressing, applies with the substitution of the
   Gateway for the 6rd CE, and use of the Gateway's assigned IPv4
   address to derive the virtual interface address.

2.3.  Address Selection

   No change from [RFC5969].

2.4.  Gateway-Initiated 6rd Configuration

   It is the Gateway/IP edge rather than the 6rd CE that must be
   configured with the IPv4MaskLen, 6rdPrefix, 6rdPrefixLen, and
   6rdBRIPv4Address.

   The IPv4MaskLen is redefined to be the number of high-order bits that
   are identical across all IPv4 addresses assigned to network nodes in
   the IPv4 network.

   No special configuration of customer equipment, in particular,
   customer edge routers, is required.  Hence the 6rd DHCPv4 option is
   inapplicable.

   Border Relay configuration is unchanged.

   The discussion of Neighbour Unreachability Detection in [RFC5969] is
   inapplicable.

   The considerations on IPv6 in IPv4 encapsulation in Section 9 of
   [RFC5969] apply with the substitution of the Gateway/IP edge for the
   CE.

2.5.  Transition Considerations

   No change from [RFC5969].

2.6.  IPv6 Address Space Usage

   If the 6rd address format is used, there is no change from Section 11
   of [RFC5969].  If the address format follows the example given in
   Figure 4, the address space usage for 6rd is the same as that used
   for ordinary IPv6 address assignments.
