Abstract 
    
   The TLS protocol is widely deployed and used over the Internet. 
   Client and server nodes compute a set of keys called the key-block, 
   according to a pseudo random function (PRF). This draft proposes a 
   keying infrastructure based on the TLS protocol. It suggests 
   defining an additional Key Distribution Function (KDF) in order to 
   deliver a set of cryptographic keys. In a peer to peer mode keys are 
   directly produced as inputs of the KDF functions. For centralized 
   architectures they are delivered through containers, secured with 
   keys derived from the KDF function.

1 Introduction 
    
   The TLS protocol [TLS 1.0] [TLS 1.1] [TLS 1.2] is widely deployed 
   and used over the Internet. Client and server nodes compute a set of 
   keys called the key-block, according to a pseudo random function 
   (PRF) and two random values client-random and server-random, 
   respectively produced by these entities. 
    
   There is an increasing need in the Internet to set up efficient keys 
   distribution infrastructures, able to generate and to deliver 
   cryptographic material required by multiple applications, as 
   illustrated by section 6. 
    
   This draft proposes a keying infrastructure based on the TLS 
   protocol. 
    
   Full or abbreviated handshakes are performed according to the TLS 
   specification. 
    
   We suggest defining additional Key Distribution Functions (KDFi) in 
   order to deliver a set of cryptographic keys according to the 
   relation, 
    
   Keys = KDFi(master-secret, client-random, server-random, other-
   information). 
    
   Particular KDF MAY be negotiated by the client according to specific 
   TLS extensions [TLS-EXT] or dedicated cipher suites. 
    
   In a peer to peer mode keys are directly produced as inputs of the 
   KDF functions, this mode of operation is for example quite suitable 
   for distributed architecture, in which networks nodes are typically 
   equipped with certificates and RSA keys. 
    
   On the other hand, centralized architectures deliver keys from a 
   unique server to remotely managed nodes. In this later case 
   cryptographic keys MUST be delivered through application data, 
   according to cipher suites negotiated during the TLS handshake, but 
   working with keys computed with the KDF function.

2 Basic Exchanges 
    
2.1 Full handshake 
    
   The full handshake mode is a four ways handshake that performs one 
   way or mutual authentication between client and server entities. A 
   master secret is computed by both parties, and each of them proves 
   its knowledge of such value by Finished messages, which are 
   protected according to cryptographic algorithms negotiated between 
   client and server, and identified by the CipherSuite parameter.

   Figure 1. Full handshake 
    
   In the peer to peer mode, keys are computed according to the 
   selected KDF procedure and its associated information: 
    
   Keys = KDF(master-secret, client-random, server-random, other-
   information) 
    
    
   In centralized architecture, an AVP attribute conveys a set of keys, 
   protected according to cryptographic algorithms pointed by the 
   CipherSuite parameter, but dealing with keys produced by the KDF 
   function. 
    
2.2 Abbreviated Handshake 
    
   The abbreviated handshake mode is a three ways handshake that 
   performs a mutual authentication between client and server entities, 
   which share the knowledge of a previous master secret. Each of them 
   proves this assumption by Finished messages, which are protected

   Figure 3. AVP Container 
    
   The AVP format is imported from the [TTLS] document. 
    
   The AVP Code is four octets and, combined with the Vendor-ID field 
   if present, identifies the attribute (i.e. the container structure) 
   uniquely.

   The 'V' (Vendor-Specific) bit indicates whether the optional Vendor-
   ID field is present. 
    
   The 'M' (Mandatory) bit indicates whether support of the AVP is 
   required. If this bit is set to 0, this indicates that the AVP may 
   be safely ignored if the receiving party does not understand or 
   support it. 
    
   The 'r' (reserved) bits are unused and MUST be set to 0 by the 
   sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver. 
    
   The AVP Length field is three octets, and indicates the length of 
   this AVP including the AVP Code, AVP Length, AVP Flags, Vendor-ID 
   (if present) and Data. 
    
   Data Length is two octets and indicates the size of data without 
   padding bytes. According to selected cryptographic algorithms 
   padding byte MAY be added in order to get a length compatible with 
   ciphered blocs. 
    
2.4 Data encryption and integrity 
    
   Cryptographic keys (Kc and Ki), used by encryption algorithms (Kc) 
   and MAC procedures (Ki), are derived according to TLS 
   specifications, by use KDF in place of the TLS PRF function. 
    
   A message M is concatenated to L null bytes, where L is the output 
   length (in bytes) of the HMAC procedure, and optional padding bytes. 
   If a cipher bloc algorithm is used, then the total length MUST be a 
   multiple of the bloc size. 
    
   M1 = M || 0:L || Pad* 
    
   A HMAC is computed over M1 
    
   MAC = HMAC(Ki, M1) 
    
   A M2 message is built, M2 = M || MAC || Pad* 
    
   This M2 message is encrypted in order to produce the data field 
    
   Data = {M2}Kc 
    
3 Key Derivation Functions (KDF) 
    
3.1 TLS PRF function 
    
   In [TLS extractor] it is suggested to use the TLS PRF function, 
   according to the relation: 
    
    

   Urien                         Expires June 2009           [Page 6] 
 
                              TLS Key Generation         December 2008 
 
   KDF= PRF(master_secret, label, 
            client-random || server-random ||  
            context-value-length || context-value) 
    
    
3.2 HMAC KDF 
    
   We suggest using a HMAC based instantiation for KDF, as introduced 
   in [HMAC KDF]. 
    
   The HMAC procedure is identical to the MAC algorithm negotiated 
   during the handshake session (e.g. HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA1, HMAC-
   SHA256). 
    
   Notations. 
    
   - The first argument to a keyed function denotes the key, the value 
   K is the key to PRF and x its input. 
   - The symbol || denotes concatenation. 
   - Given two numbers N and n the symbol N:n represents the value N 
   written as n-bit integer. 
   - L is the length in bits, of this output value delivers by the HMAC 
   procedure 
    
   Pseudo Random Key = PRK = HMAC(client-random || server-random, 
   master-secret) 
    
   Keying material, whose length in bits is D, required D/L operations.  
    
   First is expressed as 
    
   K(1) =   HMAC(PRK, 0:L || KeyLabel || 0:32), 
    
   Further operations (whose number is i) are computed according to 
    
   K(i+1) = HMAC(PRK, K(i)|| KeyLabel || i:32), 
    
   where KeyLabel is an ASCII string. 
    
3.3 NIST compatible KDF 
    
  3.3.1 PRF functions 
    
   The [NIST KDF] standard proposes two candidates for PRF functions: 
    
   - PRF = HMAC(s,x), and  
   - PRF = CMAC(s,x) 
    
   Where s is a seed (a secret key in this draft context) and x an 
   input data (a stream of bytes) 
    

   Urien                         Expires June 2009           [Page 7] 
 
                              TLS Key Generation         December 2008 
 
   We suggest to compute s according to [HMAC KDF] 
    
   s = PRK = HMAC(client-random || server-random, master-secret) 
    
  3.3.2 KDF functions 
    
   Two methods are proposed by the [NIST KDF] standard: 
    
   - KDF in counter mode, and 
   - KDF in feedback mode 
    
   KDF functions are based on PRF using the PRK key and additional data 
   such as 
    
   - The length (L) of the generated cryptographic material, 
   - The Label (a binary string) of the derived keying material, 
   - The Context (a binary string) of the derived keying material (for 
   example identities of parties who want to compute/use this key) 
    
   KDF = PRF(PRK, f(L, Label, context)) 
    
4 Use cases 
    
4.1 Hierarchical Model for Content/Service Protection 
    
   The ETSI 102 474 standard [TS 102.474] introduces a hierarchical 
   model for content/service protection mechanisms, targeting digital 
   IP datacast over video broadcasting. This scheme is a nice 
   illustration of a centralized architecture, in which cryptographic 
   keys are securely pushed from head-ends towards terminal devices. 
    
   Each terminal device holds a Right Encryption Key (REK). 
    
   This cryptographic material is used in conjunction with Keys 
   Management protocol (KMM) in order to push from head-ends to 
   terminals Services Rights Keys (SEK). 
    
   In turn the Key Stream Message (KSM) protocol, associated to the SEK 
   key, transport Traffic Encryption Keys (TEK) from head-ends to 
   terminals. 
    
   At last, clear content is encrypted with TEK, and is broadcasted 
   from head-ends to terminals 
    
   As an illustration the TLS protocol MAY be used in order to collect 
   the SEK keys. The REK cryptographic material can be instantiated 
   either by a terminal certificate (authenticated by a Certificate-
   Verify message) or by a pre-shared key [RFC 4279]. A SEK key is 
   securely pushed and transported in an AVP container.
