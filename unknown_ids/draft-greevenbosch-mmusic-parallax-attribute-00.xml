        This document introduces a "ParallaxInfo" attribute in SDP.
	This attribute can be used in stereoscopic applications,
        to signal the depth positioning of 2D media data within the 3D space.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        To see a 3D scene,
        the human brain interprets two different views as perceived by the left and right eyes,
        and fuses these views into a single 3D perception.
        The depth of the object is perceived by interpreting the horizontal shift of that object between the views.
        This shift is called "parallax".
      </t>
      <t>
        In stereoscopic 3D multimedia applications,
        there are various ways to transmit media streams in 3D.  
        One way is to transmit two different streams, one for the left eye and one for the right eye.
        These streams are then projected to the relevant eyes using the appropriate technology.
      </t>
      <t>
        When sending text streams in 3D,
        the solution mentioned above would imply sending the same text stream twice.
        Since the two streams would only differ in horizontal positioning,
        this introduces a lot of unnecessary overhead.
      </t>      
      <t>
        This document specifies a "ParallaxInfo" attribute in SDP 
        <xref target="RFC4566"/>,
        which is used to transfer the parallax information.
        It eliminates the need to send two different streams separately,
        as they can be calculated from a single stream and the "ParallaxInfo" attribute value.
      </t>
      <t>      
        The attribute transfers this information as two parameters: 
        one indicating which view (left/right/centre) is carried by the stream,
        and another to signal the parallax between the objects.
      </t>
      <t>
        The attribute is not restricted for signalling the parallax of text streams,
        but it can also be used to place other 2D objects in the 3D space.
        Examples include a channel logo,
        an electronic programme guide and on-screen display of an audio volume indicator.

    <section title="The ParallaxInfo attribute">
       <t>
         The SDP attribute "ParallaxInfo" is used to transmit the depth positioning of 2D media data, 
         such as a text stream,
         in the 3D space.        
       </t>
       <t>
         The attribute has the following syntax:
         <figure title="">
           <artwork>
   a=ParallaxInfo:&lt;transmitted position&gt; &lt;parallax&gt;
           </artwork>
         </figure>
         The &lt;transmitted position&gt; indicates whether the L-, C- or R-stream is transmitted,
         whereas &lt;parallax&gt; indicates the parallax (i.e. shift) between corresponding L- and R-views in pixels.
       </t>
       <t>
         The &lt;transmitted position&gt; can have the following values:
         <list style="hanging">
           <t hangText="&quot;L&quot;">
             indicates that the transmitted stream is the L-stream. 
             A stereoscopic device MUST calculate the corresponding R-views by shifting the L-views &lt;parallax&gt; pixels towards the right.
           </t>
           <t hangText="&quot;C&quot;">
             indicates that the transmitted stream is the C-stream.
             A stereoscopic device MUST calculate the corresponding L-views by shifting the C-views &lt;parallax&gt;/2 pixels towards the left,
             and the R-views by shifting the C-views &lt;parallax&gt;/2 pixels towards the right.
             &lt;parallax&gt; SHOULD be even.
             If it is odd, the divided value MUST be rounded off towards zero.
           </t>
           <t hangText="&quot;R&quot;">
             indicates that the transmitted stream is the R-stream.
             A stereoscopic device MUST calculate the corresponding L-views by shifting the R-views &lt;parallax&gt; pixels towards the left.
           </t>
         </list>
       </t>
       <t>
	 &lt;parallax&gt; MAY be negative.
         In this case, the shift direction is reversed.
       </t>
       <t>
         The "ParallaxInfo" attribute can be a session-level attribute or a media-level attribute. 
         As a session-level attribute, 
         it specifies the default parallax value which can be applied to all the 2D media streams in the session being described.  
         As a media-level attribute, 
         it specifies the parallax value which can be applied to the associated 2D media stream, 
         overriding any session-level parallax value specified. 
       </t>
       <t>
         The stereoscopic device MAY use the session-level attribute value for on-screen display,
         for example an audio volume indicaton, 
         channel indication or electronic programme guide.
       </t>
       <t>
         Notice that a 2D device that does not support the "ParallaxInfo" attribute will ignore it, 
         and therefore display the 2D media data on the position as transmitted.
       </t>     
     </section>
     <section title="Example">
       <t>
         The following is an example of an SDP description of a session with 
         an audio stream, a video stream and a 3GPP timed text stream (see <xref target="3gpp-tt"/>),
         streamed using RTP as per <xref target="RFC4396"/>.
         The 3GPP timed text stream
         is the L-stream,
         and each R-view is 16 pixels on the left of the L-view.
         Notice that this corresponds to the virtual positioning of the text in front of the screen.
       </t>

           </artwork>
         </figure>        
       <t>
         Notice that the default value "-20" is overridden by the value "-16" for the text stream.
         However the "-20" value is still signalled for on-screen display of e.g. volume control and other 2D graphics.
       </t>
       <t>
         In case each R-view is 24 pixels on the right of the associated L-view,
         i.e. the virtual positioning of the text is behind the screen, 
         then the  three lines defined for 3gpp-tt can be replaced as follows:
         <figure title="">
           <artwork>
   m=video 52888 RTP/AVP 97
   a=rtpmap:97 3gpp-tt/1000
   a=ParallaxInfo:L 24
           </artwork>
         </figure>
       </t>
     </section>
     <section title="Remarks">
       <t>
         A positive parallax value indicates virtual positioning of the 2D media data behind the screen.
         This is the case when the objects in the L-view are on the left of the same objects in the R-view.
         Similarly, 
         a negative parallax value indicates that  the objects in the R-view are on the left of the same objects in the L-view,
         and corresponds to virtual positioning in front of the screen.
       </t>
       <t>
         Since the "ParallaxInfo" attribute indicates a shift of the transmitted stream,
         it might happen that the L- or R-view trespasses the bounderies of the display.
         In this case, clipping is necessary, as illustrated by <xref target="3Dpic"/>.
       </t>
       <t>
         Similarly,
         there are areas which are covered by the L-view but not by the R-view and vice versa.
         These areas need to be filled in a sensible way.
         Since the "ParallaxInfo" attribute is designed for objects that overlay other video data
         (e.g. subtitles),
         it is trivial to fill in uncovered areas by using the underlying video data.
         However, if there is no underlying video data,
         other mechanisms to fill in the uncovered areas need to be defined.
         Definition of these mechanisms are out of scope of this document.
