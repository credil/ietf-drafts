                  Lightweight 4over6 in access network
              draft-cui-softwire-b4-translated-ds-lite-03

Abstract

   The dual-stack lite mechanism provide an IPv4 access method over IPv6
   ISP network for end users.  Dual-Stack Lite enables an IPv6 provider
   to share IPv4 addresses among customers by combining IPv4-in-IPv6
   tunnel and Carrier Grade NAT.  However, in dual-stack lite, CGN has
   to maintain active NAT sessions, which could become the performance
   bottom-neck due to high dynamic s of NAT entries, memory cost and log
   issue.  This document propose the lightweight 4over6 mechanism which
   moves the translation function from tunnel concentrator (AFTR) to
   initiators (B4s), and hence reduce the mapping scale on the
   concentrator to per-customer level.  For NAT44 translation usage, the
   mechanism will allocate port restricted IPv4 addresses to initiators
   in a flexible way independent of IPv6 network in the middle.

1.  Introduction

   Dual-stack lite technology[RFC6333] provides IPv4 access over IPv6
   access network.  Dual-Stack lite (DS-lite) also mitigates IPv4
   address exhaustion by sharing public IPv4 addresses amongst users.
   The B4 element establishes an IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire to the AFTR and
   encapsulates the IPv4 packets into the softwire.  When AFTR receives
   the IPv6 packets, it will decapsulate them and perform NAT-44 on the
   packets.  This procedure allows AFTR to dynamically assign sessions
   to users when needed; hence, increases port-sharing radio and
   utilization.  There is a trade-off, though.  The AFTR is required to
   maintain active NAT sessions.  In a centralized deployment models
   where one AFTR serves thousands of users, the large numbers of NAT
   sessions may become performance bottom-neck.  First, maintaining
   active NAT sessions requires AFTR constantly creating and purging NAT
   sessions.  Second, a large NAT table demands more processing power
   for searching and more memory space.  In addition, dynamic session-
   based NAT will create large number of log entries, which will also be
   a challenging problem.

   To address these issues, we propose an extension to DS-lite.  We
   propose to create rule mapping in the AFTR and distributes the
   dynamic NAT table into B4 elements.  The B4 element will be
   provisioned with an IPv6 address, an IPv4 address and a port-range.
   The IPv6 address will be used to create the Softwire.  The IPv4
   address and port-range will be used for NAT-44 in the home
   gateway(CPE).  Most CPE have been performing NAT-44 today.  The CPE
   will perform PAT on user's packets with the IPv4 address and port-
   range provisioned by the ISP.  The packets are forwarded between the
   CPE and the AFTR by IPv6 encapsulation over the tunnel.  The AFTR
   will maintain a static mapping entry with the IPv6 address, IPv4
   address and port-range per user.  For inbound IPv4 packet on AFTR, it
   would use the IPv4 destination address and port as the index and use
   the forwarding rule in the static mapping table to encapsulate the
   packets to the destination CPE.  The AFTR would not create NAT entry
   per sessions.  This will significantly reduce the AFTR's NAT table
   size.

   Compared to DS-lite, this extension reduces the AFTR NAT table size.
   Each entry represents a B4 element.  This also relaxes the
   requirement to create a log entry per dynamic session.  AFTR only
   needs to keep a log entry per B4 element.  This is also an extended
   case which covers addressing sharing for
   [I-D.cui-softwire-host-4over6].  However, the extension will decrease
   IPv4 address utilization.  Moreover, since port randomization
   algorithm must use ports within this port-range, it may cause the
   port randomization algorithm more predictable.

   Compared to stateless solutions with port range/set allocation such
   as 4rd, this mechanism is suitable for operators who prefers to keep
   IPv6 and IPv4 addressing separated.  For example, an operator may
   want to provide IPv4 with an on-demand way in its IPv6 network, the
   dynamic allocation of IPv4 address and port makes more efficient
   usage of IPv4 resource.  Another example is that an operator may only
   have many small and discontinuous IPv4 blocks available to provide
   IPv4 over IPv6, rather than a few big IPv4 blocks.  This mechanism
   keeps dynamic feature of IPv4-IPv6 address binding as in DS-Lite, so
   it won't require to administrate and manage many 4rd domains in the
   network and mapping rules in the CPEs.

3.  Terminology

   Starting from here, the document will use the terminologies of
   lightweight 4over6 instead of DS-lite for distinction.

   Lightweight 4over6: lightweight 4over6 is an IPv4-over-IPv6 hub and
   spoke mechanism proposed in this document, which supports address
   sharing to deal with IPv4 address exhaustion, and places the IPv4
   translation on the initiator side.

   Lightweight 4over6 initiator (or "initiator" for short): the tunnel
   initiator in lightweight 4over6 mechanism.  The lightweight 4over6
   initiator could be a host directly connected to IPv6, or an dual-
   stack CPE in front of an IPv4 local network.  It is responsible for
   IPv4 public-private translation besides tunnel encapsulation and
   decapsulation.

   Lightweight 4over6 concentrator (or "concentrator" for short): the
   tunnel concentrator in lightweight 4over6 mechanism.  The lightweight
   4over6 concentrator connects the ISP IPv6 network and IPv4 Internet.
   It provides tunnel encapsulation and decapsulation but no IPv4
   public-private translation.

4.  Lightweight 4over6 Overview

   Figure 1 provides an overview of the lightweight 4over6 mechanism.  A
   lightweight 4over6 initiator which can be either an IPv6 hosts or
   CPE, and the lightweight 4over6 concentrator are separated by the
   IPv6 network in the middle, so they use IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel to build
   IPv4 connectivity.  An initiator uses IPv4 address with restricted
   port range for this IPv4 connectivity, which is acquired through
   either DHCPv4 with the concentrator, or through PCP with the PCP
   server.  The concentrator keeps the mapping between initiator's IPv6
   address and the allocated IPv4 address + port range.

5.  Port Restricted IPv4 Address Allocation

   As is described above, a lightweight 4over6 initiator needs the
   public address and port for stateful translation.  This is be
   achieved by basic PCP mechanism [I-D.ietf-pcp-base].  It's obvious
   that individual address + port allocation when required is not
   efficient due to round-trip time delay and high signaling volume
   caused.  A practical manner would be allocating a group of address +
   port at one time beforehand, i.e., allocating IPv4 address with a
   port range, which is known as "restricted address".

   To our knowledge there're two methods which are probably suitable for
   restricted address allocation from concentrator to initiator.  One is
   extending DHCP to support address allocation with port range
   embedded.  [I-D.bajko-pripaddrassign] discusses this DHCP usage.  In
   this special context, we need to build the DHCPv4 procedure over IPv6
   [I-D.cui-softwire-dhcp-over-tunnel].  The other is extending PCP to
   support port range control.  See [I-D.tsou-pcp-natcoord] for details.
   Adopting either method, An initiator can get port restricted IPv4
   addresses allocated dynamically from the concentrator, i.e. the
   dynamic mapping rule between IPv4 address, port range and IPv6
   address can be passed down to the initiator in the initiation phase.
   Unlike stateless 4over6 solutions such as
   [I-D.murakami-softwire-4rd], the port restricted address allocation
   in lightweight 4over6 has no requirement on careful planning of the
   IPv6 domain range, IPv4/IPv6 mapping relationship, prefix length and
   multiplex ratio, etc.  It is quite flexible for ISPs to manage the
   IPv6 access network and have no impact on IPv6 routing.

6.  Lightweight 4over6 Initiator Behavior

   A lightweight 4over6 initiator should support either extended DHCP
   client, or extended PCP client, as is described above.  When
   requiring IPv4 access, the initiator would run either client to get a
   dynamic port restricted IPv4 address, and renew/extend it when the
   lease/lifetime is about to expire.

   The data plane functions of the initiator includes translation and
   encapsulation/decapsulation.  For CPE initiator case, the initiator
   runs a standard local NAT44 with the address pool consist of the
   allocated port restricted address.  When sending out an IPv4 packet
   with private source address, it performs NAT44 function and
   translates the source address into public.  Then it encapsulates the
   packet with concentrator's IPv6 address as destination IPv6 address,
   and forward it to the concentrator.  When receiving an IPv4-in-IPv6
   packet from the concentrator, the initiator decapsulates the IPv6
   packet to get the IPv4 packet with public destination IPv4 address.
   Then it performs NAT44 function and translates the destination
   address into private.

   For host initiator case, the host gets public address directly.  It
   is also suggested that the host run a local NAT to map randomly
   generated ports into the restricted, valid port range.  Private-
   public address translation would not be needed in this NAT.  Another
   solution is to have the IP stack to only assign ports within the
   restricted, valid range to applications.  Either way the host
   guarantees that every port number in the packets sent out by itself
   falls into the allocated port range.

7.  Lightweight 4over6 Concentrator Behavior

   The lightweight 4over6 concentrator should either allocate port
   restricted addresses directly(perform an extended DHCPv4 server, or
   an extended PCP server), or leave the allocation to dedicated DHCP/
   PCP server(and perform a relay in DHCP case).  When accomplishing one
   such allocation, the concentrator simultaneously install a mapping
   entry into the mapping table.  This entry consists of the public IPv4
   address, the port range and initiator's IPv6 address.  Its lifetime
   is set according to the allocation.  It'll be used for encapsulation
   of inbound packets.  This mapping entry would be deleted when the
   lifetime expires, and refresh its lifetime when the initiator renews/
   extends the allocation.

   The data plane functions of the concentrator is purely encapsulation
   and decapsulation.  When receiving an IPv4-in-IPv6 packet from an
   initiator, the concentrator decapsulates it and forwards it to IPv4
   Internet.  When receiving an IPv4 packet from the Internet, it uses
   the destination address and port from this packet to lookup the
   destination initiator's IPv6 address in the mapping table.  Then the
   concentrator encapsulates this packet using the IPv6 address found in
   the table as IPv6 destination address, and forwards it to the correct
   initiator based on native IPv6 routing.  Hence there is no port-range
   routing in IPv6 network anymore.

   behavior.

10.  ICMP processing

   ICMP availability would become a challenge in port restricted address
   environment.  To support ICMP "session" initiated from a lightweight
   4over6 initiator, the mechanism divides ICMP id field in the same way
   with dividing port space, i.e. each initiator will get the ICMP id
   range which is identical to the allocated port range.  An initiator
   only uses the allocated address and restricted id range when send out
   an ICMP request.  Hence the concentrator can encapsulate the
   corresponding ICMP reply correctly according to the ICMP id field.
   The inbound ICMP request would be left unsupported on the
   concentrator, which is the similar behavior of NAT/CGN.  See details
   about ICMP processing in section 4.2 of [I-D.sun-v6ops-laft6]

11.  Mechanism Analysis

   Compared with original dual-stack lite, lightweight 4over6 removes
   the translation burden from the concentrator and distribute the job
   to initiators on user-side.  Also it decreases the state scale on
   concentrator from per-session level down to per-user level.  This
   would significantly reduce the hardware cost of the concentrator, and
   relieve the situation that the concentrator becomes the performance
   bottleneck.  Leveraging lightweight 4over6, one concentrator can
   serve a lot more customers.

   Besides, since this mechanism reduces the number of simultaneous
   address mappings of each customer on concentrator to one, it makes
   concentrator logging much more feasible.  Moreover, locating the
   translation on user side eases the ALG and NAT referral problem since
   it'll be no different from the situation of local NAT in today's IPv4
   network.  Solutions like uPnP already exist for quite a long time.
   Most current CPEs have already implemented NAT44 functionalities,
   lightweight 4over6 would not bring a lot more complexity to existing
   CPEs.

   Lightweight 4over6 allocates port restricted address independent of
   the IPv6 network in the middle.  No specific IPv6 address format is
   required.  IPv4 and IPv6 addressing and routing remain separated.
   The ISP can provide IPv4 in a flexible, on-demand way, as well as
   manage the native IPv6 network without the influence of IPv4-over-
   IPv6 requirements.  And it would also be easy to achieve future
   adjustment of IPv4 address pool.

   The costs of lightweight 4over6 for achieving all these benefits are
   lower IPv4 address utilization ratio and extra signaling behavior.
   The address multiplexing manner of port restricted address is
   relatively more static than the CGN manner.  This may cause the port
   randomization algorithm more predictable.  There are solutions which
   increase the prediction difficulty at the cost of more sophisticated
   port rule mapping [I-D.bsd-softwire-stateless-port-index-analysis].
   And dual-stack lite doesn't require address and port allocation
   between concentrator and initiators.  When compared to stateless
   solutions, lightweight 4over6 still keeps per-user states rather than
   becoming purely stateless.

12.  Security Consideration

   Since port randomization algorithm must use ports within this port-
   range, it may cause the port randomization algorithm more
   predictable.  Therefore, non-continuous port set algorithms (e.g. as
   defined in [I-D.mdt-softwire-mapping-address-and-port]) can be
   introduced to further improve the security.
