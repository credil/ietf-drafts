1.  Introduction

   This document describes the architecture of OMA mobile email (MEM)
   using Internet Mail protocols defined by the IETF.  Many of these
   protocols have been enhanced by the LEMONADE work group for use in
   the mobile environment and are summarized in the LEMONADE profile [5]
   and its revision LEMONADE profile bis [6].  This document shows how
   the OMA MEM Requirement document [3] , OMA MEM Architecture [2] and
   OMA MEM Technical Specification [4] relate to the work of LEMONADE.

2.  OMA Mobile Email (MEM)

   The OMA Mobile Email (MEM) sub-working group has spent some time
   studying the requirements and architecture of mobile email.  IETF
   LEMONADE has been liaising with them and have based much of our
   Internet Mail enhancements based on their input.  This section
   summarizes the output of the OMA.

2.1.  OMA MEM Requirements

   The OMA MEM activity has collected a set of use cases and derived
   requirements for a mobile email enabler (MEM). the resulting work is
   summarized in OMA MEM Requirements [3].  Some requirements relates to
   email protocols, some involve other OMA technologies outside the
   scope of IETF and some relate to implementations and normative
   interoperability statements for clients and servers.

2.2.  OMA MEM Architecture

   This section gives a brief introduction to the OMA MEM Architecture.

2.2.1.  OMA MEM logical Architecture

   The OMA MEM activity has derived a logical architecture from the
   requirements and use cases described in [3].  A simplification for
   illustrative purposes is shown inFigure 1, where arrows indicate
   content flows.

   o  The MEM client which implements the client-side functionality of
      the OMA Mobile Email Enabler.  It is also responsible for
      providing the mobile email user experience and interface to the
      user and storing the email and data to be sent to the MEM server
      when not connected.

   o  The MEM server which implements the server-side functionality of
      the OMA Mobile Email Enabler (MEM).

   o  The MEM protocol between the MEM Client and MEM Server.  It is
      responsible for all the inband data exchanges that take place
      between the MEM client and server in order to update the MEM
      client with email server changes, the email server with changes in
      the MEM client and to send new email from the email server.

   o  Other OMA enablers are needed to directly support the mobile email
      enabler.  They are out of scope of IETF but they may include
      support for:

      *  Client provisioning and management for over the air
         installation of the MEM client on the device, provisioning of
         its settings and revocation

      *  Messaging enablers for outband notification, where outband
         notifications that are server to client event exchanges not
         transported by the MEM protocol but via other channels.

   OMA identifies different interfaces:

   o  ME-1: MEM client interface to interact via the MEM protocol with
      the MEM server

   o  ME-2: Corresponding interface of the MEM server

   o  ME-3: Outband MEM server interfaces (e.g. to support generation of
      server to client notifications).

   o  ME-4: Outband MEM client interfaces (e.g. to receive server to
      client notifications).

   o  ME-5: Interface for management of MEM enabler server settings,
      user preferences and filters (globally and per account)

   The MEM server enables an email server.  In a particular
   implementation, the email server may be packaged with (internal to
   it) the MEM server or be in a separate component.  In such cases,
   interfaces to the email server are out of scope of the OMA MEM
   specifications.  In the present document, we focus on the case where

Internet-Draft            LEMONADE architecture            November 2007


   the backend consists of IETF IMAP and Submit servers.  However,
   relationship to other cases are also discussed.  The I2 interface is
   an OMA notation to designate protocol / interfaces that are not
   specified by the MEM enabler but may be standardized elsewhere.

2.2.2.  OMA MEM Deployment Issues

   The OMA MEM Architecture document [2] further identifies deployment
   models.

2.2.2.1.  OMA MEM proxy

   The OMA MEM Architecture document [2] identifies OMA MEM server
   proxies as server components that may be deployed ahead of firewalls
   to facilitate traversa of firewalls.

2.2.2.2.  OMA MEM deployment cases

   OMA MEM identifies that each component (MEM client, MEM servers,
   Other enablers and email server) may be deployed in different
   domains, possibly separated by firewalls and other network
   intermediaries.  MEM proxies may be involved in front of firewall
   that protects the MEM server domain.

   OMA MEM target support of configurations where:

   o  All components are within a same domain (Mobile operator)

   o  MEM client and other enablers are in the mobile operator domain, a
      MEM proxy is involved and MEM server and email server are in the
      domain of the email service provider

   o  MEM client and other enablers as well as a MEM proxy are in the
      mobile operator domain, MEM server and email server are in the
      domain of the email service provider

   o  MEM client and other enablers are in the mobile operator domain, a
      MEM proxy is in a third party service provider domain and MEM
      server and email server are in the domain of the email service
      provider

   o  MEM client, other enabler and MEM server are in the mobile
      operator domain and email server is in the domain of the email
      service provider

   o  MEM client and other enablers are in the mobile operator domain,
      MEM server is in a third party service provider domain and the
      email server is in the domain of the email service provider

2.3.  OMA MEM Technical Specification

   The OMA MEM activity will conclude with a specification for a mobile
   email enabler (MEM).  The ongoing work is in OMA MEM Technical
   Specification [4].  LEMONADE is a basis for the mechanism, however,
   some additional details that are outside the scope of IETF will also
   be included.

   OMA provides ways to perform provisioning via OMA client provisioning
   and device management.  Other provisioning specifications are
   available (e.g.  SMS based).

   OMA provides enablers to support outband notifications: the outband
   notification mechanisms.  Also, OMA XDM may be considered also for
   outband filter changes. .

                  Figure 2: LEMONADE logical architecture

   The LEMONADE profile [5] assumes:

   o  IMAP protocol [7] including LEMONADE profile extensions [5]

   o  SUBMIT protocol (SMTP [9], ...) including LEMONADE profile
      extensions

   o  LEMONADE profile compliant IMAP store connected to MTA (Mail
      Transfer Agent) via ESMTP [8]

   o  LEMONADE profile compliant Submit server connected to MTA via
      ESMTP

   o  Lemonade profile message store / submit server protocols (URLAUTH)
      (see [5]).

   o  Outband server to client notifications relying on external
      notification mechanisms (and notification protocols) that may be
      out of scope of the LEMONADE profile.

   o  A LEMONADE aware MUA (Mail User Agent).  While use of outband
      notification is described in the LEMONADE profile, support for the
      underlying notifications mechanisms/protocols is out of scope of
      the LEMONADE specifications.

   Figure 3: Mapping of LEMONADE logical architecture  onto the OMA MEM
                           logical architecture.

   As described in Section 3, the LEMONADE profile assumes LEMONADE
   profile compliant IMAP stores and Submit servers.  Because the
   LEMONADE profile extends the IMAP store and the submit server, the
   mobile enablement of email provided by the LEMONADE profile is
   directly provided in these server.  Mapped to OMA MEM logical
   architecture, for the case considered and specified by the LEMONADE
   profile, the MEM server and email server logically combined.  They
   are however split into distinct LEMONADE message store and LEMONADE
   submit server.  ME-2 consists of two interfaces ME-2a and ME-2b
   associated respectively to IMAP extended according to the LEMONADE
   profile and SUBMIT extended according to the LEMONADE profile.

   The MUA is part of the MEM client.

   External notifications mechanism can be part of the other OMA enabler

   specified by OMA (or other activities).

3.2.  LEMONADE realization of OMA MEM with non-LEMONADE compliant
      servers

   The OMA MEM activity is not limited to enabling Lemonade compliant
   servers.  It explicitly identifies the need to support other
   backends.

3.2.1.  LEMONADE realization of OMA MEM with non-LEMONADE IMAP servers

   Figure 4 illustrates the case of IMAP servers that are not (yet)
   LEMONADE compliant.  In such case, the I2 interface between the MEM
   server components and the IMAP store and submit server are IMAP and
   SUBMIT.

4.  Filters and server to client notifications and LEMONADE

   OMA MEM RD [3] and AD [2] emphasize the need to provide mechanisms
   for server to client notifications of email events and filtering.
   Figure 6 illustrates how notification and filterings are introduced
   in LEMONADE profile [5].

      Figure 6: Filtering mechanism defined in LEMONADE architecture

   In Figure 6, four categories of filters are defined:

   o  AF: Administrative Filters - Set up by email service provider.  AF
      are typically not configured by the user and set to apply policies
      content filtering, virus protection, spam filtering etc...

   o  DF: Deposit Filters - Filters that are executed on deposit of new
      emails.  They can be defined as SIEVE filters [10].  They can
      include vacation notices.

   o  VF: View Filters - Filters that define which emails are visible to
      the MUA.  View filters can be performed via IMAP using the
      facilities described in [6].

Internet-Draft            LEMONADE architecture            November 2007


   o  NF: Notification Filters - Filters that define for what email
      server event an outband notification is sent to the client, as
      described in [6].

   The filters are manageable from the MUA:

   o  NF and DF: via SIEVE management protocol

5.  Notifications objectives

   According to these analyses, there is a need to support: # Mechanisms
   for event-based (server to client) synchronization: * Defines the
   relationship between notification mechanisms and the IMAP4 protocol -
   To minimize the latency observed for email events on the email server
   to be reflected in the email client. - To avoid unnecessary polling
   and requests from the e-mail clients: .  To reduce the total amount
   of data to be exchanged between email server and client, e.g. by
   allowing the email client to select which messages to synchronize and
   how to synchronize. .  To reduce the amount of transactions. * Needs
   to cope with possible lost or delayed notifications * Support in-band
   (within IMAP band) and out-band notifications (Exchanged via other
   servers / enablers). - Specified in ways that are network transport
   independent but may contain some bindings to particular notification
   channels (e.g.  SMS binary, WAP Push, SIP Notification, ...) - When
   the email client is connected to the email server, only inband
   notifications is expected take place * Defines notification payload
   for inband and outband mechanisms. # Server-side filtering to decide
   which messages will be accessible by the email client. * Filtering
   results into the following logical types: - Type A: Messages filtered
   out and not accessible by the email client (no notification, no
   header access, no access) - Type B: Messages that are accessible by
   the mobile e-mail enabler client but no outband notification takes
   place.  Inband notification might however take place if email client
   is already connected to email server. - Type C: Messages that are
   accessible by the e-mail client for which notifications (outband or
   inband) are always sent to the email client. # Notions of Filters: *
   View filters: Filters that determine which email messages are of type
   B and C or A * Notification filters: Filters that determine which
   email messages are of type C or B * Event filters: Filters that
   determines what events are to be notified to the client # Mechanisms
   to allow the user to update the filters from the email client #
   Mechanisms to allow configuration and exchange of settings between
   the client and the server in band or outband: - Server to client:
   e.g. server ID, account name, policies, ... - Client to server: e.g.
   rules filters vacation notices, notification channel, ...

6.  Security considerations

   This specification provides no security measures beyond those in the
   referenced Internet Mail and LEMONADE documents.

   We note however that there are security risks associated to:

   o  Outband notifications

   o  Server configuration by client

   o  Client configuration by server

   o  Presence of MEM proxy servers

   o  Presence of MEM servers as intermediaries

   o  Measures to addess the need to traverse firewalls
