Internet-Draft        6LoWPAN Routing Requirements            March 2009


1.  Problem Statement

   In the context of this document, low-power wireless personal area
   networks (LoWPANs) are formed by devices that are compatible with the
   IEEE 802.15.4 standard [6].  Most of the LoWPAN devices are
   distinguished by their low bandwidth, short range, scarce memory
   capacity, limited processing capability and other attributes of
   inexpensive hardware.  The characteristics of nodes participating in
   LoWPANs are assumed to be those described in RFC 4919 [3].

   IEEE 802.15.4 networks support star and mesh topologies.  However,
   neither the IEEE 802.15.4 standard nor the 6LoWPAN format
   specification ("IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4" [4]) define how mesh
   topologies could be obtained and maintained.  Thus, the 6LoWPAN
   formation and multi-hop routing should be supported by higher layers,
   either the 6LoWPAN adaptation layer or the IP layer.  A number of IP
   routing protocols have been developed in various IETF working groups.
   However, these existing routing protocols may not satisfy the
   requirements of multi-hop routing in 6LoWPANs, for the following
   reasons:

   o  6LoWPAN nodes have special types and roles, such as primary
      battery-operated nodes, power-affluent nodes, mains-powered and
      high-performance gateways, data aggregators, etc. 6LoWPAN routing
      protocols should support multiple device types and roles.

   o  The more stringent requirements apply to LoWPANs, as opposed to
      higher performance or non-battery-operated networks. 6LoWPAN nodes
      are characterized by small memory sizes, low processing power, and
      are running on very limited power supplied by primary non-
      rechargeable batteries (a few KBytes of RAM, a few dozens of
      KBytes of ROM/flash memory, and a few MHz of CPU is typical).  A
      node's lifetime is usually defined by the lifetime of its battery.

   o  Handling sleeping nodes is very critical in LoWPANs, more than in
      traditional ad-hoc networks.  LoWPAN nodes might stay in sleep-
      mode for most of the time.  Time synchronization is important for
      efficient forwarding of packets.

   o  Routing in 6LoWPANs might possibly translate to a simpler problem
      than routing in higher-performance networks.  LoWPANs might be
      either transit networks or stub networks.  Under the assumption
      that LoWPANs are never transit networks (as implied by [4]),
      routing protocols may be drastically simplified.  This document
      will primarily focus on stub networks.  Based on the necessity,
      this document may be extended with 6LoWPAN network configurations
      that include transit networks.

   o  Routing in LoWPANs might possibly translate to a harder problem
      than routing in higher-performance networks.  Routing in LoWPANs
      requires power-optimization, stable operation in harsh
      environments, data-aware routing, etc.  These requirements are not
      easily satisfiable all at once.

   This creates new challenges on obtaining robust and reliable routing
   within LoWPANs.

   The 6LoWPAN problem statement document ("6LoWPAN Problems and Goals"
   [3]) briefly mentions four requirements on routing protocols;

      (a) low overhead on data packets

      (b) low routing overhead

      (c) minimal memory and computation requirements

      (d) support for sleeping nodes considering battery saving

   These four high-level requirements describe the basic need for
   6LoWPAN routing.  Based on the fundamental features of 6LoWPAN, more
   detailed routing requirements are presented in this document, which
   can lead to further analysis and protocol design.

   Using the 6LoWPAN header format [4], there are two layers routing
   protocols can be defined at, commonly referred to as "Mesh Under" and
   "Route Over".  The Mesh Under approach supports routing under the IP
   link and is directly based on the link-layer IEEE 802.15.4 standard
   in 6LoWPAN, therefore using (64-bit or 16-bit short) MAC addresses.
   On the other hand, the Route Over approach relies on IP routing and
   therefore supports routing over possibly various types of
   interconnected links (see also Figure 1).  Most statements in this
   document consider both the Mesh Under and Route Over cases.
   Note: The ROLL WG is now working on Route Over approaches for Low
   power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), not specifically for 6LoWPAN.  This
   document is focused on 6LoWPAN-specific requirements, in alignment
   with the ROLL WG.

   Considering the problems above, detailed 6LoWPAN routing requirements
   must be defined.  Application-specific features affect the design of
   6LoWPAN routing requirements and the corresponding solutions.
   However, various applications can be profiled by similar technical
   characteristics, although the related detailed requirements might
   differ (e.g., a few dozens of nodes for home lighting system need
   appropriate scalability for the applications, while billions of nodes
   for a highway infrastructure system also need appropriate
   scalability).  This document states the routing requirements of

   6LoWPAN applications in general, while trying to give examples for
   different cases of routing.  This routing requirements document does
   not imply that a single routing solution may be the best one for all
   6LoWPAN applications.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

   Readers are expected to be familiar with all the terms and concepts
   that are discussed in "IPv6 over Low-Power  Wireless Personal Area
   Networks (6LoWPANs): Overview, Assumptions,  Problem Statement, and
   Goals" [3], and " Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4
   Networks" [4].

   This document defines additional terms:

   LoWPAN Coordinator Node

      A logical functional entity that performs the special role of
      coordinating its child nodes for local data aggregation, status
      management of local nodes, etc.  Thus, the Coordinator Node does
      not need to coincide with a link-layer PAN coordinator and there
      may be multiple instance in a LoWPAN.

   LoWPAN Mesh Node

      A LoWPAN node that forwards data between arbitary source-
      destination pairs in 6LoWPAN adaptation layer using link address
      (and thus only exist in Mesh Under LoWPANs).  A Mesh Node may also
      serve as a LoWPAN Host.

   Additionally, in alignment with all other 6LoWPAN drafts, this
   document uses the same terms and definitions as provided by the
   6LoWPAN ND draft [8]:

   LoWPAN Host

      A node that only sources or sinks IPv6 datagrams.  Referred to as
      a host in this document.  The term node (see LoWPAN Node) is used
      when the the differentiation between host and router is not
      important.

   LoWPAN Edge Router

      An IPv6 router that interconnects the LoWPAN to another network.
      Referred to as an edge router in this document.

Internet-Draft        6LoWPAN Routing Requirements            March 2009


   LoWPAN Router

      A node that forwards datagrams between arbitrary source-
      destination pairs using a single 6LoWPAN interface performing IP
      routing (and thus only exist in route over LoWPANs).  A LoWPAN
      Router may also serve as a LoWPAN Host - both sourcing and sinking
      IPv6 datagrams.  Refered to as a router in 6LoWPAN documents.  All
      LoWPAN Routers perform ND message relay on behalf of other nodes.

   LoWPAN Node

      A node that composes a LoWPAN.  In mesh under, each intermidiate
      node performs multi-hop forwarding at L2.  In route over, each
      intermidiate node serves as a LoWPAN router performing IP routing.

   Mesh Under

      A LoWPAN configuration where the link-local scope is defined by
      the boundaries of the LoWPAN and includes all nodes within.
      Forwarding and multihop routing functions are achieved at L2
      between mesh nodes.

   Route Over

      A LoWPAN configuration where the link-local scope is defined by
      those nodes reachable over a single radio transmission.  Due to
      the time-varying characteristics of wireless communication, the
      neighbor set may change over time even when nodes maintain the
      same physical locations.  Multihop is achieved using IP routing.

   Backbone Link

      This is an IPv6 link that interconnects two or more edge routers.
      It is expected to be deployed as a high speed backbone in order to
      federate a potentially large set of LoWPANs.

   Extended LoWPAN

      This is the aggregation of multiple LoWPANs as defined in [3]
      interconnected by a backbone link via Edge Routers and forming a
      single subnet.

   LoWPAN Link

      A low-power wireless link which is shared by a link-local scope in
      a LoWPAN.  In a LoWPAN, a link can be a very instable set of
      nodes, for instance the set of nodes that can receive a packet
      that is broadcast over the air in a route over LoWPAN, or the set

      of nodes currently reachable in an L2 mesh in a mesh under LoWPAN.
      Such a set may vary from one packet to the next as the nodes move
      or as the radio propagation conditions change.

   LoWPAN Subnet

      A subnet including a LoWPAN or an Extended LoWPAN, together with
      the backbone link with the same subnet prefix and prefix length.

3.  Design Space

   Apart from a wide variety of routing algorithms possible for 6LoWPAN,
   the question remains as to whether routing should be performed Mesh
   Under (in the adaptation layer defined by the 6lowpan format document
   [4]), or by the IP-layer using a Route Over approach.  The most
   significant consequence of Mesh Under routing is that the inherited
   stringent characteristics of IEEE 802.15.4 would directly affect the
   6LoWPAN routing mechanisms, therefore using (64-bit or 16-bit short)
   MAC addresses instead of IP addresses, and a 6LoWPAN would be seen as
   a single IP link.  In case a Route Over mechanism is to be applied to
   a 6LoWPAN it must also support 6LoWPAN's unique properties using
   global IPv6 addressing.

   Figure 1 shows the place of 6LoWPAN routing in the entire network
   stack.

    +-----------------------------+    +-----------------------------+

        Figure 1: Mesh-under (left) and route-over routing (right)

   In order to avoid packet fragmentation and the overhead for
   reassembly, routing packets should fit into a single IEEE 802.15.4
   physical frame and application data should not be expanded to an
   extent that they no longer fit.

3.1.  6LoWPAN Headers for Routing

   In the simplest case for a Mesh Under where predefined layer two
   forwarding is appropriate, the mesh-header defined in RFC 4944 [4] is
   sufficient.  Frame Delivery in a Link-Layer Mesh is described in the
   Section 11 in RFC 4944.  The mesh type and header defined in RFC 4944
   are as follows:

Internet-Draft        6LoWPAN Routing Requirements            March 2009


   A 6LoWPAN Mesh Header:

                    1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                       Figure 2: 6LoWPAN Mesh Header

   However, the mesh header is not sufficient when it needs full routing
   functionalities applying more routing metrics and functions.  If a
   Mesh Under routing protocol is built for operation in 6LoWPAN's
   adaptation layer, routing control packets with MAC addresses are
   placed after the 6LoWPAN Dispatch.  A new Dispatch value is REQUIRED
   to be assigned for Mesh Under routing.  As shown in Figure 3,
   multiple routing protocols can be supported by the usage of different
   Dispatch bit sequences.

   A 6LoWPAN encapsulated Mesh Under Routing packet:

    +---------------------+----------------+---------+----
    | Dispatch (new val.) | Routing header |   ...
    +---------------------+----------------+---------+----

          Figure 3: 6LoWPAN packet format and Mesh Under routing

   When a Route Over protocol is built over the IPv6 layer, the Dispatch
   value can be chosen as one of the Dispatch patterns for 6LoWPAN,
   followed by a compressed or uncompressed IPv6 header, and Route Over
   routing header will be included in the payload of IPv6 packet.

   Figure 4 depicts an example of 6LoWPAN encapsulated Route Over
   routing packets for HC1 defined in RFC 4944:

    +----------------+-------------+------------------------+---
    | Dispatch + HC1 | IPv6 Header | Payload(Routing packet)| ...

3.2.  Reference Network Model

   When a 6LoWPAN follows the Mesh Under configuration, the LoWPAN Edge
   Router (ER) is the only IPv6 router in the 6LoWPAN (see Figure 6).
   This means that the IPv6 link-local scope includes all nodes in the
   LoWPAN.  A Mesh Under routing mechanism MUST be provided to support
   multi-hop transmission.

   If a Route Over routing is used in the stub-network, not only the ER
   but also other intermediate nodes become LoWPAN Routers and perform
   standard layer 3 routing (see Figure 7).  The link-local scope is
   defined by one radio hop.

   in the 6LoWPANs, and node (a) of 6LoWPAN [A] wants to communicate
   with node (b) of 6LoWPAN [B], the normal IPv6 mechanisms can be
   employed.  For Mesh Under, there is one IP hop from a node (a) to ER
   of [A], no matter how many radio hops stay apart from each other.
   This, of course, assumes the existence of a Mesh Under routing
   protocol in order to reach the ER.  For Route Over, the IPv6 address
   of (b) is set as the destination of the packets, and the nodes
   perform IP routing to the ER for these outgoing packets.  In this
   case, one radio hop is one IPv6 link.  Additionally, a default route
   to the ER could be inserted into the 6LoWPAN routing system.

4.  Scenario Considerations and Parameters for 6LoWPAN Routing

   IP-based LoWPAN technology is still in its early stage of
   development, but the range of conceivable usage scenarios is
   tremendous.  The numerous possible applications of sensor networks
   make it obvious that mesh topologies will be prevalent in LoWPAN
   environments and robust routing will be a necessity for expedient
   communication.  Research efforts in the area of sensor networking
   have put forth a large variety of multi-hop routing algorithms [7]
   and [21].  Most related work focuses on optimizing routing for
   specific application scenarios, which can largely be categorized into
   several models of communication, including the following ones:

   o  Flooding (in very small networks)

   o  Hierarchical routing

   o  Geographic routing

   o  Self-organizing coordinate routing

   Depending on the topology of a 6LoWPAN and the application(s) running
   over it, different types of routing may be used.  However, this
   document abstracts from application-specific communication and
   describes general routing requirements valid for overall routing in
   6LoWPANs.

   The following parameters can be used to describe specific scenarios
   in which the candidate routing protocols could be evaluated.

   a.  Network Properties:

       *  Number of Devices, Density and Network Diameter:
          These parameters usually affect the routing state directly
          (e.g. the number of entries in a routing table or neighbor
          list).  Especially in large and dense networks, policies must
          be applied for discarding "low-quality" and stale routing
          entries in order to prevent memory overflow.

       *  Connectivity:
          Due to external factors or programmed disconnections, a
          6LoWPAN can be in several states of connectivity; anything in
          the range from "always connected" to "rarely connected".  This
          poses great challenges to the dynamic discovery of routes
          across a 6LoWPAN.

       *  Dynamicity (including mobility):
          Location changes can be induced by unpredictable external

Internet-Draft        6LoWPAN Routing Requirements            March 2009


          factors or by controlled motion, which may in turn cause route
          changes.  Also, nodes may dynamically be introduced into a
          6LoWPAN and removed from it later.  The routing state and the
          volume of control messages may heavily dependent on the number
          of moving nodes in a LoWPAN and their speed.

       *  Deployment:
          In a 6LoWPAN, it is possible for nodes to be scattered
          randomly or to be deployed in an organized manner.  The
          deployment can occur at once, or as an iterative process,
          which may also affect the routing state.

       *  Spatial Distribution of Nodes and Gateways:
          Network connectivity depends on the spatial distribution of
          the nodes, and on other factors like device number, density
          and transmission range.  For instance, nodes can be placed on
          a grid, or can be randomly placed in an area (bidimensional
          Poisson distribution), etc.  In addition, if the 6LoWPAN is
          connected to other networks through infrastructure nodes
          called gateways, the number and spatial distribution of
          gateways affects network congestion and available data rate,
          among others.

       *  Traffic Patterns, Topology and Applications:
          The design of a LoWPAN and the requirements on its application
          have a big impact on the network topology and the most
          efficient routing type to be used.  For different traffic
          patterns (point-to-point, multipoint-to-point, point-to-
          multipoint) and network architectures, various routing
          mechanisms have been introduced, such as data-aware, event-
          driven, address-centric, and geographic routing.

       *  Classes of Service:
          For mission-critical applications, support of multiple classes
          of service may be required in resource-constrained LoWPANs and
          may require a certain degree of routing protocol overhead.

       *  Security:
          LoWPANs may carry sensitive information and require a high
          level of security support where the availability, integrity,
          and confidentiality of data are primordial.  Secured messages
          cause overhead and affect the power consumption of LoWPAN
          routing protocols.

   b.  Node Parameters:

       *  Processing Speed and Memory Size:
          These basic parameters define the maximum size of the routing



Kim, et al.             Expires September 9, 2009              [Page 14]

          state.  LoWPAN nodes may have different performance
          characteristics.

       *  Power Consumption and Power Source:
          The number and topology of battery- and mains-powered nodes in
          a LoWPAN affect routing protocols in their selection of
          optimal paths for network lifetime optimization.

       *  Transmission Range:
          This parameter affects routing.  For example, a high
          transmission range may cause a dense network, which in turn
          results in more direct neighbors of a node, higher
          connectivity and a larger routing state.

       *  Traffic Pattern: This parameter affects routing since high-
          loaded nodes (either because they are the source of packets to
          be transmitted or due to forwarding) may incur a greater
          contribution to delivery delays and may consume more energy
          than lightly loaded nodes.  This applies to both data packets
          and routing control messages.

   c.  Link Parameters:
       This section discusses link parameters that apply to IEEE
       802.15.4 legacy mode (i.e. not making use of improved schemes).

       *  Throughput:
          The maximum user data throughput of a bulk data transmission
          between a single sender and a single receiver through an
          unslotted IEEE 802.15.4 2.4 GHz channel in ideal conditions is
          as follows [20]:

          +  64-bit MAC addresses, unreliable mode: 13.9 kbps

          +  64-bit MAC addresses, reliable mode: 12.8 kbps

       *  Latency:
          The range of latencies of a frame transmission between a
          single sender and a single receiver through an unslotted IEEE
          802.15.4 2.4 GHz channel in ideal conditions are as shown next
          [20].  For unreliable mode, the actual latency is provided.
          For reliable mode, the round-trip-time including transmission

5.  6LoWPAN Routing Requirements

   This section defines a list of requirements for 6LoWPAN routing.  The
   most important design property unique to low-power networks is that
   6LoWPANs have to support multiple device types and roles, for
   example:

   o  primarily battery-operated host nodes (called "power-constrained
      nodes" in the following)

   o  mains-powered host nodes (an example for what we call "power-
      affluent nodes")

   o  power-affluent (but not necessarily mains-powered) high-
      performance gateway(s)

   o  nodes with various functionality (data aggregators, relays, local
      manager/coordinators, etc.)

   Due to these unique device types and roles LoWPANs need to consider
   the following two primary attributes:

   o  Power conservation: some devices are mains-powered, but most are
      battery-operated and need to last several months to a few years
      with a single AA battery.  Many devices are mains-powered most of
      the time, but still need to function for possibly extended periods
      from batteries (e.g. on a construction site before building power
      is switched on for the first time).

   o  Low performance: tiny devices, small memory sizes, low-performance
      processors, low bandwidth, high loss rates, etc.

   These fundamental attributes of LoWPANs affect the design of routing
   solutions, so that existing routing specifications should be
   simplified and modified to the smallest extent possible when there
   are appropriate solutions to adapt, otherwise, new solutions should
   be introduced in order to fit the low-power requirements of LoWPANs,
   meeting the requirements described in the following.

5.1.  Support of 6LoWPAN Device Properties

   The general objectives listed in this section should be followed by
   6LoWPAN routing protocols.  The importance of each requirement is
   dependent on what node type the protocol is running on and what the
   role of the node is.  The following requirements are based on
   battery-powered LoWPAN nodes.

   [R01] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD allow to be implemented with



Kim, et al.             Expires September 9, 2009              [Page 17]

Internet-Draft        6LoWPAN Routing Requirements            March 2009


   small code size and require low routing state to fit the typical
   6LoWPAN node capacity (e.g., code size considering its typical flash
   memory size, and routing table less than 32 entries).

      A 6LoWPAN routing protocol solution should consider the limited
      memory size typically starting at 4KB.  RAM size of LoWPAN nodes
      often ranges between 2KB and 10KB, and program flash memory
      normally consists of 48KB to 128KB. (e.g., in the current market,
      MICAz has 128KB program flash, 4KB EEPROM, 512KB external flash
      ROM; TIP700CM has 48KB program flash, 10KB RAM, 1MB external flash
      ROM).

      Due to these hardware restrictions, code length should be
      considered to fit within a small memory size; no more than 48KB to
      128KB of flash memory including at least a few tens of KB of
      application code size.  A routing protocol of low complexity helps
      to achieve the goal of reducing power consumption, improves
      robustness, requires lower routing state, is easier to analyze,
      and may be implicitly less prone to security attacks.

      In addition, operation with low routing state (such as routing
      tables and neighbor lists) SHOULD be maintained since some typical
      memory sizes preclude to store state of a large number of nodes.
      For instance, industrial monitoring applications need to support
      at maximum 20 hops [16].  Small networks can be designed to
      support a smaller number of hops.  It is highly dependent on the
      network architecture, but considering the 6LoWPAN device
      properties, there should be at least one mode of operation that
      can function with 32 forwarding entries or less.

   [R02] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD cause minimal power
   consumption by the efficient use of control packets (e.g., minimize
   expensive IP multicast which causes link broadcast to the entire
   LoWPAN) and by the efficient routing of data packets.

      One way of battery lifetime optimization is by achieving a minimal
      control message overhead.  Compared to functions such as
      computational operations or taking sensor samples, radio
      communications is by far the dominant factor of power consumption
      [10].  Power consumption of transmission and/or reception depends
      linearly on the length of data units and on the frequency of
      transmission and reception of the data units [13].

      The energy consumption of two example RF controllers for low-power
      nodes is shown in [11].  The TR1000 radio consumes 21mW when
      transmitting at 0.75mW, and 15mW on reception (with a receiver
      sensitivity of -85dBm).  The CC1000 consumes 31.6mW when
      transmitting 0.75mW, and 20mW for receiving (with a receiver



Kim, et al.             Expires September 9, 2009              [Page 18]

Internet-Draft        6LoWPAN Routing Requirements            March 2009


      sensitivity of -105dBm).  The power continuation under the concept
      of an idealized power source is explained in [11].  Based on the
      energy of an idealized AA battery, the CC1000 can transmit for
      approximately 4 days straight or receive for 9 consecutive days.
      Note that availability for reception consumes power as well.

      Multicast may causes flooding in the LoWPAN.  On consideration
      this, 6LoWPAN routing protocol SHOULD minimize the control cost by
      the routing packets.  Another document discusses control cost of
      routing protocols in low power and lossy networks [19].

5.2.  Support of 6LoWPAN Link Properties

   6LoWPAN links have the characteristics of low data rate and possibly
   high loss rates.  The routing requirements described in this section
   are derived from the link properties.

   [R03] 6LoWPAN routing protocol control messages SHOULD NOT exceed a
   single IEEE 802.15.4 frame size in order to avoid packet
   fragmentation and the overhead for reassembly.

      In order to save energy, routing overhead should be minimized to
      prevent fragmentation of frames.  Therefore, 6LoWPAN routing
      should not cause packets to exceed the IEEE 802.15.4 frame size.
      This reduces the energy required for transmission, avoids
      unnecessary waste of bandwidth, and prevents the need for packet
      reassembly.  As calculated in RFC4944 [4], the maximum size of a
      6LoWPAN frame, in order not to cause fragmentation, is 81 octets.
      This may imply the use of semantic fragmentation and/or algorithms
      that can work on small increments of routing information.

   [R04] The design of routing protocols for LoWPANs must consider the
   fact that packets are to be delivered with sufficient probability
   according to application requirements.

      Requirements on successful end-to-end packet delivery ratio (where
      delivery may be bounded within certain latency) vary depending on
      applications.  In industrial applications, some non-critical
      monitoring applications may tolerate successful delivery ratio of
      less than 90% with hours of latency; in some other cases, a
      delivery ratio of 99.9% is required [16].  In building automation
      applications, application layer errors must be below 0.01% [18].

      Successful end-to-end delivery of packets in a IEEE 802.15.4 mesh
      depends on the quality of the path selected by the routing
      protocol and on the ability of the routing protocol to cope with
      short-term and long-term quality variation.  The metric of the
      routing protocol strongly influences performance of the routing



Kim, et al.             Expires September 9, 2009              [Page 19]

Internet-Draft        6LoWPAN Routing Requirements            March 2009


      protocol in terms of delivery ratio.

      The quality of a given path depends on the individual qualities of
      the links (including the devices) that compose that path.  IEEE
      802.15.4 settings affect the quality perceived at upper layers.
      In particular, in IEEE 802.15.4 reliable mode, if an
      acknowledgment frame is not received after a given period, the
      originator retries frame transmission up to a maximum number of
      times.  If an acknowledgment frame is still not received by the
      sender after performing the maximum number of transmission
      attempts, the MAC layer assumes the transmission has failed and
      notifies the next higher layer of the failure.  Note that
      excessive retransmission may be detrimental, see RFC 3819 [5].

   [R05] The design of routing protocols for LoWPANs must consider the
   latency requirements of applications and IEEE 802.15.4 link latency
   characteristics.

      Latency requirements may differ from a few hundreds milliseconds
      to minutes, depending on the type of application.  Real-time
      building automation applications usually need response times below
      500 ms between egress and ingress, while forced entry security
      alerts must be routed to one or more fixed or mobile user devices
      within 5 seconds [18].  Non-critical closed loop applications for
      industrial automation have latency requirements that can be as low
      as 100 ms but many control loops are tolerant of latencies above
      1s [16].  In contrast to this, urban monitoring applications allow
      latencies smaller than the typical intervals used for reporting
      sensed information; for instance, in the order of seconds to
      minutes [17].

      The range of latencies of a frame transmission between a single
      sender and a single receiver through an ideal unslotted IEEE
      802.15.4 2.4 GHz channel is between 2.46ms and 6.02ms in 64 bit
      MAC address unreliable mode and 2.20 ms to 6.56ms in 64 bit
      address reliable mode.  The range of latencies of 868 MHz band is
      from 11.7 ms to 63.7 ms, depending on the address type and
      reliable/unreliable mode used.  Note that the latencies may be
      larger than that depending on channel load, MAC layer settings ,
      and reliable/unreliable mode choice.  Note that other MAC
      approaches than the legacy 802.15.4 may be used (e.g.  TDMA).
      Duty cycling may further affect latency (see [R08 ]).

      Note that a tradeoff exists between [R05] and [R04].

   [R06] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD be robust to dynamic loss
   caused by link failure or device unavailability either in short-term
   (e.g. due to RSSI variation, interference variation, noise and



Kim, et al.             Expires September 9, 2009              [Page 20]

Internet-Draft        6LoWPAN Routing Requirements            March 2009


   asynchrony) or in long-term (e.g. due to a depleted power source,
   hardware breakdown, operating system misbehavior, etc).

      An important trait of 6LoWPAN devices is their unreliability due
      to limited system capabilities, and also because they might be
      closely coupled to the physical world with all its unpredictable
      variation.  In harsh environments, LoWPANs easily suffer from link
      failure.  Collision or link failure easily increases Send Queue/
      Receive Queue (SQ/RQ) and it can lead to queue overflow and packet
      losses.

      For home applications, where users expect feedback after carrying
      out actions (such as handling a remote control while moving
      around), routing protocols must converge within 2 seconds if the
      destination node of the packet has moved and must converge within
      0.5 seconds if only the sender has moved [15].  The tolerance of
      the recovery time can vary depending on the application, however,
      the routing protocol must provide the detection of short-term
      unavailability and long-term disappearance.  The routing protocol
      has to exploit network resources (e.g. path redundancy) to offer
      good network behavior despite of node failure.

   [R07] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD be designed to correctly
   operate in the presence of link asymmetry.

      Link asymmetry occurs when the probability of successful
      transmission between two nodes is significantly higher in one
      direction than in the other one.  This phenomenon has been
      reported in a large number of experimental studies and it is
      expected that 6LoWPANs will exhibit link asymmetry.

5.3.  Support of 6LoWPAN Network Characteristics

   6LoWPANs can be deployed in different sizes and topologies, adhere to
   various models of mobility, tolerate various levels of interference,
   etc.  In any case, LoWPANs must maintain low energy consumption.  The
   requirements described in the following subsection are derived from
   the network attributes of 6LoWPANs.

   [R08] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD be reliable despite
   unresponsive nodes due to periodic hibernation.

      Many nodes in LoWPAN environments might periodically hibernate
      (i.e. disable their transceiver activity) in order to save energy.
      Therefore, routing protocols must ensure robust packet delivery
      despite nodes frequently shutting off their radio transmission
      interface.  Feedback from the lower IEEE 802.15.4 layer may be
      considered to enhance the power-awareness of 6LoWPAN routing



Kim, et al.             Expires September 9, 2009              [Page 21]

Internet-Draft        6LoWPAN Routing Requirements            March 2009


      protocols.

      CC1000-based nodes must operate at a duty cycle of approximately
      2% to survive for one year from idealized AA battery power source
      [11].  For home automation purposes, it is suggested that that the
      devices have to maximize the sleep phase with a duty cycle lower
      than 1% [15], while in building automation applications, batteries
      must be operational for at least 5 years when the sensing devices
      are transmitting data (e.g. 64 bytes) once per minute [18].

      Dependent on the application in use, packet rates differ from
      1/sec to 1/day.  Routing protocols need to know the cycle of the
      packet transmission and utilize the information to calculate
      routing paths.

   [R09] The metric used by 6LoWPAN routing protocols MAY utilize a
   combination of the inputs provided by the lower layers and other
   measures to obtain the optimal path considering energy balance and
   link qualities.

      In homes, buildings, or infrastructure, some nodes will be
      installed with mains power.  Such power-installed nodes MUST be
      considered as a relay points for more roles in packet delivery.
      6LoWPAN routing protocols MUST know the power constraints of the
      nodes.

      Simple hop-count-only mechanisms may be inefficient in 6LoWPANs.
      There is a Link Quality Indication (LQI), or/and RSSI from IEEE
      802.15.4 that may be taken into account for better metrics.  The
      metric to be used (and its goal) may depend on applications and
      requirements.

      The numbers in Figure 8 represent the Link Delivery Ratio (LDR) of
      each pair of nodes.  There are studies that show a piecewise
      linear dependence between LQI and LDR [14].

      In this simple example, there are two options in routing from node
      A to node C, with the following features:

      A.  Path AC:

          +  (1/0.6) = 1.67 avg. transmissions needed for each packet

          +  one-hop path

          +  good in energy consumption and end-to-end latency of data
             packets, bad in delivery ratio (0.6)

          +  bad in probability of route reconfigurations

      B.  Path ABC

          +  2*(1/0.81) = 2.47 avg. transmissions needed for each packet

          +  two-hop path

          +  bad in energy consumption and end-to-end latency of data
             packets, good in delivery ratio (0.81)

      If energy consumption of the network must be minimized, path AC is
      the best (this path would be chosen based on a hop count metric).
      However, if the delivery ratio in that case is not sufficient, the
      best path is ABC (it would be chosen by an LQI based metric).
      Combinations of both metrics can be used.

      The metric also affects the probability of route reconfiguration.
      Route reconfiguration, which may be triggered by packet losses,
      may require transmission of routing protocol messages.  It is
      possible to use a metric aimed at selecting the path with low
      route reconfiguration rate by using LQI as an input to the metric.
      Such a path has good properties, including stability and low
      control message overhead.

   [R10] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD be designed to achieve both
   scalability from a few nodes to millions of nodes and minimality in
   terms of used system resources.

      A LoWPAN may consist of just a couple of nodes (for instance in a
      body-area network), but may expand to much higher numbers of
      devices (e.g. monitoring of a city infrastructure or a highway).
      For home automation applications it is envisioned that the routing
      protocol must support 250 devices in the network [15], while
      routing protocols for metropolitan-scale sensor networks must be
      capable of clustering a large number of sensing nodes into regions

Internet-Draft        6LoWPAN Routing Requirements            March 2009


      containing on the order of 10^2 to 10^4 sensing nodes each [17].
      It is therefore necessary that routing mechanisms are designed to
      be scalable for operation in various network sizes.  However, due
      to a lack of memory size and computational power, 6LoWPAN routing
      might limit forwarding entries to a small number, such as at
      maximum 32 routing table entries.

   [R11] The procedure of route repair and related control messages
   should not harm overall energy consumption from the routing
   protocols.

      Local repair improves throughput and end-to-end latency,
      especially in large networks.  Since routes are repaired quickly,
      fewer data packets are dropped, and a smaller number of routing
      protocol packet transmissions are needed since routes can be
      repaired without source initiated Route Discovery [12].  One
      important consideration here may be to avoid premature depletion,
      even in case that impairs other requirements.

   [R12] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD allow for dynamically adaptive
   topologies and mobile nodes.  When supporting dynamic topologies and
   mobile nodes, route maintenance should keep in mind the goal of a
   minimal routing state and routing protocol message overhead.

      Building monitoring applications, for instance, require that the
      mobile devices SHOULD be capable of leaving (handing-off) from an
      old network joining onto a new network within 15 seconds [18].
      More interactive applications such as used in home automation
      systems, where users are giving input and expect instant feedback,
      mobility requirements are also stricter and a convergence time
      below 0.5 seconds is commonly required [15].  In industrial
      environments, where mobile equipment such as cranes move around,
      the support of vehicular speeds of up to 35 km/h are required to
      be supported by the routing protocol [16].  Currently, 6LoWPANs
      are not being used for such a fast mobility, but dynamic
      association and disassociation MUST be supported in 6LoWPAN.

      There are several challenges that should be addressed by a 6LoWPAN
      routing protocol in order to create robust routing in dynamic
      environments:

      *  Mobile nodes changing their location inside a LoWPAN:
         If the nodes' movement pattern is unknown, mobility cannot
         easily be detected or distinguished by the routing protocols.
         Mobile nodes can be treated as nodes that disappear and re-
         appear in another place.  Movement pattern tracking increases
         complexity and can be avoided by handling moving nodes using
         reactive route updates.

Internet-Draft        6LoWPAN Routing Requirements            March 2009


      *  Movement of a LoWPAN with respect to other (inter)connected
         LoWPANs:
         Within stub networks, more powerful gateway nodes need to be
         configured to handle moving LoWPANs.

      *  Nodes permanently joining or leaving the LoWPAN:
         In order to ease routing table updates, reduce their size, and
         minimize error control messages, nodes leaving the network may
         announce their disassociation to the closest edge router or if
         any, to a specific node which takes charge of local association
         and disassociation.

   [R13] 6LoWPAN routing protocol SHOULD support various traffic
   patterns; point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and multipoint-to-
   point, while avoid excessive multicast traffic in a LoWPAN.

      6LoWPANs often have point-to-multipoint or multipoint-to-point
      traffic patterns.  Many emerging applications include point-to-
      point communication as well. 6LoWPAN routing protocols should be
      designed with the consideration of forwarding packets from/to
      multiple sources/destinations.  Current WG drafts in the ROLL
      working group explain that the workload or traffic pattern of use
      cases for LoWPANs tend to be highly structured, unlike the any-to-
      any data transfers that dominate typical client and server
      workloads.  In many cases, exploiting such structure may simplify
      difficult problems arising from resource constraints or variation
      in connectivity.

5.4.  Support of Security

   The routing requirement described in this subsection allows secure
   transmission of routing messages.  Solutions may take into account
   the specific features of IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layers.

   [R14] 6LoWPAN protocols SHOULD support secure delivery of control
   messages.  A minimal security level can be achieved by utilizing AES-
   based mechanism provided by IEEE 802.15.4.

      Security threats within LoWPANs may be different from existing
      threat models in ad-hoc network environments.  Neighbor Discovery
      in IEEE 802.15.4 links may be susceptible to threats as listed in
      RFC3756 [2].  Bootstrapping may also impose additional threats.
      Security is also very important for designing robust routing
      protocols, but it should not cause significant transmission
      overhead.  While there are applications which require very high
      security, such as in traffic control, other applications are less
      easily harmed by wrong node behavior, such as a home entertainment
      system.

Internet-Draft        6LoWPAN Routing Requirements            March 2009


      The IEEE 802.15.4 MAC provides an AES-based security mechanism.
      Routing protocols need to define how this mechanism can be used to
      obtain the intended security.  Byte overhead of the mechanism,
      which depends on the security services selected, must be
      considered.  In the worst case in terms of overhead, the mechanism
      consumes 21 bytes of MAC payload.

      IEEE 802.15.4 does not specify protection for acknowledgement
      frames.  Since the sequence numbers of data frames are sent in the
      clear, an adversary can forge an acknowledgement for each data
      frame.  This weakness can be combined with targeted jamming to
      prevent delivery of selected packets.  In consequence, IEEE
      802.15.4 acknowledgements cannot be relied upon.  In applications
      that require high security, the routing protocol must not exploit
      feedback from acknowledgements (e.g. to keep track of neighbor
      connectivity, see [R16]).

5.5.  Support of Mesh-under Forwarding

   One LoWPAN may be built as one IPv6 link.  In this case, Mesh Under
   forwarding/routing mechanisms must be supported.  The routing
   requirements described in this subsection allow optimization and
   correct operation of routing solutions taking into account the
   specific features of the mesh-under configuration.

   [R15] In case a routing protocol operates in 6LoWPAN's adaptation
   layer, routing tables and neighbor lists MUST support 16-bit short
   and 64-bit extended addresses.

   [R16] In order to perform discovery and maintenance of neighbors,
   LoWPAN Nodes SHOULD avoid sending "Hello" messages of NS, NA, RS or
   RA messages.  Instead, link-layer mechanisms (such as
   acknowledgments) MAY be utilized to keep track of active neighbors.

      Reception of an acknowledgement after a frame transmission may
      render unnecessary the transmission of explicit Hello messages,
      for example.  In a more general view, any frame received by a node
      may be used as an input to evaluate the connectivity between the
      sender and receiver of that frame.

   [R17] In case there are one or more nodes allocated for the specific
   role of local management, the nodes MAY take the role of keeping
   track of node association and de-association within the charging area
   of the LoWPAN.

   [R18] If the routing protocol functionality includes enabling IP
   multicast, then it may want to employ relay points of group-targeting
   messages instead of using link-layer multicast (broadcast).
