<t>
   This draft defines a new block type to augment those defined
   in <xref target='RFC3611'/>, for use in a range of RTP applications.
</t><t>
   The new block type provides information on Packet Delay Variation using one of several standard metrics.
</t>
<t>
The metrics belong to the class of transport metrics defined in [MONARCH] (work in progress).
</t>
<t>
Instances of this Metrics Block refer by tag to the separate auxiliary Measurement Identity block 
<xref target='MEASIDENT'/> which contains information 
such as the SSRC of the measured stream, and RTP sequence numbers and time intervals indicating the span of the report.

<section anchor='intro2' title="RTCP and RTCP XR Reports">
<t>
   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in <xref target='RFC3550'/>. 
   <xref target='RFC3611'/> defined an extensible structure for reporting using
   an RTCP Extended Report (XR).  This draft defines
   a new Extended Report block that MUST be used as defined in
   <xref target='RFC3550'/> and <xref target='RFC3611'/>.
</t>
</section>
<section anchor='intro3' title="Performance Metrics Framework">
<t>
   The Performance Metrics Framework <xref target='PMOLFRAME'/> provides guidance on the

</t>
<t>
   Interval Metric flag (I): 1 bit
</t>
<t>
<list style='empty'>
<t>
This field is used to indicate whether the Packet Delay Variation metrics block is an Interval or a Cumulative report, 
that is, whether the reported values apply to the most 
recent measurement interval duration between successive metrics reports (I=1) (the Interval Duration) or to the accumulation period 
characteristic of cumulative 
measurements (I=0) (the Cumulative Duration). Numerical values for both these intervals are provided in the Measurement Identifier block 
referenced by the tag field below.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
   Measurement Identifier association (tag): 3 bits
</t>
<t>
<list style='empty'>
<t>
This field is used to identify the Measurement Identifier block <xref target='MEASIDENT'/> which describes this measurement. The relevant 
Measurement Identifier block has the same tag value as the Packet Delay Variation Metrics block. Note that there may be 
more than one Measurement Identifier block per RTCP packet.

The term Positive is associated
   with packets arriving later than the expected time.
</t><t>
   If the measured value is more negative than -2047.9375 (the value
   which would be coded as 0x8001), the value 0x8000 SHOULD be reported
   to indicate an over-range negative measurement.  If the measured
   value is more positive than +2047.8125 (the value which would be
   coded as 0x7FFD), the value 0x7FFE SHOULD be reported to indicate an
   over-range positive measurement.  If the measurement is unavailable,
   the value 0x7FFF SHOULD be reported.

<t>
Positive PDV Percentile: 16 bit, 8:8 format

Negative Threshold/Peak PDV: 16 bit, S11:4 format
</t>
<t>
<list style='empty'>
<t>
   The PDV associated with the Negative PDV percentile expressed in milliseconds.  
The term Negative is associated

   If the measured value is more negative than -2047.9375 (the value
   which would be coded as 0x8001), the value 0x8000 SHOULD be reported

</t>
<t>
Negative PDV Percentile: 16 bit, 8:8 format

</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
   If the PDV Type indicated is 2-point PDV and the Positive and Negative PDV
   Percentiles are set to 100.0 then the Positive and Negative
   Threshold/Peak PDV values are the peak values measured during the
   reporting interval (which may be from the start of the call for
   cumulative reports).  In this case, the difference between the
   Positive and Negative Threshold/Peak values defines the range of
   2-point PDV.

Mean PDV: (16 bit, S11:4 format) expressed in milliseconds
</t>
<t>
<list style='empty'>
<t>
   For MAPDV2 this value is generated according to Clause 6.2.3.2 of <xref target='G.1020'/>.  For
   interval reports the MAPDV2 value is reset at the start of the
   interval.
</t><t>
   For interarrival jitter, the value reported is the value of J(i) calculated according
   to <xref target='RFC3550'/> at the time the report is generated.
</t><t>
For 2-point PDV, the value reported is the mean of per-packet 2-point PDV values. This metric 
indicates the arrival time of the first media packet of the session with respect to the 
mean of the arrival times of every packet of the session. A single value of the metric (for a
single session) may not be
useful by itself, but its average over a number of sessions may be useful in diagnosing media 
delay at session startup. For example, this might occur if media packets are often delayed behind 
signalling packets due to head-of-line blocking.
</t><t>
   If the measured value is more negative than -2047.9375 (the value
   which would be coded as 0x8001), the value 0x8000 SHOULD be reported
   to indicate an over-range negative measurement.  If the measured
   value is more positive than +2047.8125 (the value which would be
   coded as 0x7FFD), the value 0x7FFE SHOULD be reported to indicate an
   over-range positive measurement.  If the measurement is unavailable,
   the value 0x7FFF SHOULD be reported.

<section anchor='guide' title="Guidance on use of PDV metrics">
<t>
This subsection provides informative guidance on when it might be appropriate to use each of the
PDV metric types.
</t>
<t>
Interarrival jitter (Section 6.4.1 of <xref target='RFC3550'/>) allows comparison of results with those from RTP 
end systems which support only RTCP as defined in <xref target='RFC3550'/>.
</t>
<t>
MAPDV2 (Clause 6.2.3.2 of <xref target='G.1020'/>) compares instantaneous (per-packet) delay variation against a moving average delay 
variation. This metric could be useful in determining residual impairment when an RTP end system uses an adaptive de-jitter 
buffer which tracks the average delay variation, provided the MAPDV2 algorithm and the adaptive de-jitter buffer have similar 
averaging behaviour.
</t>
<t>
2-point PDV (Clause 6.2.4 of <xref target='Y.1540'/>) reports absolute packet delay variation with respect to the time of arrival of the 
first packet of the connection. In an RTP context, the two "points" are at the sender (the synchronization source which applies RTP timestamps) 
and at the receiver. 
The value of this metric for the packet with index j is identical to the quantity D(i,j) defined in Section 6.4.1 of <xref target='RFC3550'/> 
if the packet index i is set equal to 1, that is, the reference packet for the metric is the first packet of the connection. The metric includes
the effect of the frequency offsets of clocks in both the 
sender and receiver end systems, so it is useful mainly in network where synchronisation is distributed. As well as 
measuring packet delay variation in such networks, it may be used to ensure that synchronisation is effective, for 
example where the network carries ISDN data traffic over RTP <xref target='RFC4040'/>. The metric is likely to be useful in networks 
which use fixed de-jitter buffering, because it may be used to determine the length of the required de-jitter buffer, or to determine 
if network performance has deteriorated such that existing de-jitter buffers are too small to accommodate the observed delay variation.
</t>
</section>
<section anchor='examples' title="Examples of use">
<t>
   (a) To report interarrival jitter <xref target='RFC3550'/>:
</t><t>
   Threshold PDV = FFFF (Undefined); PDV Percentile = FFFF (Undefined);
   PDV type = 0 (interarrival jitter)
</t><t>
   causes interarrival jitter to be reported in the Mean PDV field.
</t><t>
   (b) To report MAPDV2 <xref target='G.1020'/>:
</t><t>
   Pos Threshold PDV = 50.0; Pos PDV Percentile = 95.3; Neg Threshold
   PDV = 50.0 (note this implies -50ms); Neg PDV Percentile = 98.4; PDV
   type = 1 (MAPDV2)
</t><t>
   causes average MAPDV2 to be reported in the Mean PDV field.
</t><t>
   Note that implementations may either fix the reported percentile and
   calculate the associated PDV level OR may fix a threshold PDV level
   and calculate the associated percentile.  From a practical
   implementation perspective it is simpler to use the second of these
   approaches (except of course in the extreme case of a 100%
   percentile).
</t><t>
   2-point PDV, according to <xref target='Y.1540'/> is the difference in delay between the current
   packet and the first packet of the stream.  If the sending and
   receiving clocks are not synchronized, this metric includes the
   effect of relative timing drift.

   <xref target='RFC4566'/> for signaling the use of XR blocks.  XR blocks MAY be used without

<t>
When SDP is used in offer-answer, a system sending SDP may request a specific type of PDV measurement. In addition, they 
may state a specific percentile or threshold value, and expect to receive the corresponding threshold or 
percentile metric, respectively. The system receiving the SDP SHOULD send the PDV metrics requested, but 
if the metric is not available, the system receiving the SDP SHOULD send the flag value indicating that the 
metric is unavailable.

</t>
<t>
<list style='symbols'>

The information required to support an assignment is an unambiguous definition of the new metric, covering the base measurements
and how they are processed to generate the reported metric. This should include the units of measurement, how values of the metric
are reported in the three 16-bit fields "Pos Threshold/Peak PDV", "Neg Threshold/Peak PDV" and "Mean PDV" within the report block,
