1. Introduction

   P2P media streaming is one of the most popular p2p system and is a
   new developing trend for modern video system. More and more users,
   vendors as well as researchers have been attracted to it. Currently,
   there are many such systems on Internet, such as PPLive, PPStream,
   UUSee, etc. Usually all of them can provide Live and VoD programs to
   users. They have a similar system structures according to our
   measurement. In good network conditions, all of them can bring good
   experiences to users; once the stable condition is broken, the p2p
   applications will present different performance.

2. Motivation and Target of the Measurement

   Naturally, we care about how to evaluate system performance, what the
   performance limitations are under current system models, how to
   decrease the pressure on the network. In order to answer these
   questions, we study the following aspects of p2p streaming systems:

   1. To extract the general p2p media streaming system structure;

   2. To analyze and evaluate the signaling (protocol) messages (types,
   format, function, exchange sequence);

   3. To study and model the core mechanism such as initial buffer lag
   policy, buffer cache schedule policy, data fetching policy, etc;

   4. To optimize the system performance and improve network robustness;

   5. To study its effect on physical layer network, transport lay
   protocol (TCP and UDP );

   6. To study new p2p suitable transport protocol instead of
   application lay p2p transportation;

   7. To study the availability of current p2p streaming systems on
   mobile ip;

   8. To present related standard suggests.

3. Methodology of Our Measurement

   Real network based measurement is important in studying p2p media
   streaming systems. However all current commercial p2p media streaming
   systems are propriety protocol systems without any public document
   about system' working mechanism available. Although some researchers
   report some useful finds, most of our concerns are not resolved yet.
   We have to firstly deeply understand how the system works. Usually we
   use certain reverse-engineering method to analyze its working
   principle. In the protocol cracking, we mainly focus on the top 2 of
   very popular p2p streaming systems - PPLive and PPStream. Beside
   their popular degree, several other reasons make them as the starting:
   Both of them use plain text in their protocol exchanging; both udp
   and tcp are adopted; both of them are the new generation data driven
   p2p streaming systems.

   Our reverse engineering are conducted in following 3 stages:

   Firstly, by tracing a standard client, we capture interactive packets
   between the local peer and others with ethereal/windump tool. Based
   on our experience on the p2p streaming system, some basic protocol
   types must be included such as buffer map, chunk request/response,
   shake hand packet, etc. For each udp packet, it is reasonable to
   assume that each packet is a completed protocol message, while for
   tcp packets we must extract messages from all application data stream.
   Usually we can get the rough protocol format by matching traced
   packets to the known basic protocol types. But there are still many
   unknown details left.

   Secondly, the traced data is fed into our dumping tool, which can
   filter data into a text file with composed conditions, such as source
   ip/port, destination ip/port, VoD/Live protocol type. Through
   inspecting the text file of different channels, we find many regular
   changes that help us in parsing the protocol format in details. Of
   course, there is still one-third irregular data. In this case, we
   guess and try it based on our experiences in next step. At last, we
   parse about nearly 90% of PPLive and PPStream while 50% UUSee
   protocols(mostly because its signaling is encrypted). In PPLive
   system, there are about 15 message types, all of that haven't any
   clearly protocol marks in order to escape from restrictions ISPs may
   imposed on as we guess. Among these types, buffermap and peerlist
   messages are the most useful messages for us to measure and analyze
   the system.

   At the third stage, we analyze the time sequences of the protocol
   messages. Some communication time sequence is obvious, such as chunk

   request/response, while others are not. In later case, we guess and
   try differently composed events until a sequence makes right sound.
   Ultimately, all time sequences in communications are resulted
   successfully.

4. Measurement Platforms

   For different analysis, we take different measurement methods. In
   general, our environment consists of 4 dell pc servers in a private
   ip space (LAN) behind a 6mbps ADSL NAT router. each of which has
   2.8Hz Pentium CPU, 1MB memory, 80GB hard disk, 10/100Mbps Ethernet,
   windows OS, mysql database.

   session limitation enlargement.

   3. Long term multi online peers probe: different from topology
   crawler, it will probe a certain online peers in a long term in order
   to collect the detail information of these peers. Usually more
   complete protocol set should be realized in it.

   4. P2P streaming client measurement in mobile ip: A fix position PC
   is used as the mobile device, where three types of software have been
   installed: p2p streaming client software; packet capture software;
   our mobile ip simulation software.

   5. Special client accessing to official network in order to evaluate
   the system robusticity and optimize the protocol: based on
   protocols,we build the legal p2p client to join in the official p2p
   network. By this client, we can test and evaluate new protocol design
   and new core system models.

5. Data Analysis and Modeling

   As for data analysis and modeling, we have made some progress and
   published some papers [1]~[6]. Interested readers can refer to them
   for more details.



6. Study of P2P Media Streaming Protocols by the Measurement

   We have measurement PPLive and PPstream and guessed the protocols
   both for live streaming and VoD streaming respectively. However due
   to some encryption(It's said to be Scrambling), VoD streaming data
   from PPStream hasn't been analyzed yet. We list the signaling
   transaction of pplive live streaming and VoD and ppstream live
   streaming as follows:

   systems have similar process. We have depicted the interactions
   between peers and peers as well as trackers in the problem statement
   draft. Interested readers can refer to draft-zhang-ppsp-problem-
   statement for details.

   However, there are still some difference between pplive,UUsee and
   ppstream which belongs to their high secrets. For example, in the
   buffer aspect, pplive and UUSee have a large buffer, which can smooth
   time delay jitters but contributes to relative large startup delay.
   The chunk fetch policy is seqential fetcing and rarest first at same
   time. The schema of the buffer is a variable length in chunks but
   fixed length in playback time. The buffer map schedule is simple
   based on chunksid. On the other hand, PPStream is a small buffer
   system (early version), which has small startup delay but leads to
   video freeze with large jitters. The chunk fetch is randomly in each
   buffer window. The schema of the buffer is of multi playable media
   blocks with fixed playback time (mulit buffers) for each of them.
   Hence its buffer schedule is based on multi buffer windows, where
   each chunk is uniquely marks indicated by the buffer window offset
   and the internal chunk id. According to our understanding, the
   mechanism of PPStream is a litter complex.
