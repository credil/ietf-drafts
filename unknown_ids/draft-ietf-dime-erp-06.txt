       Diameter support for EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP)
                       draft-ietf-dime-erp-06.txt

Abstract

   The EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP) defines extensions to the
   Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) to support efficient re-
   authentication between the peer and an EAP Re-authentication (ER)
   server through a compatible authenticator.  This document specifies
   Diameter support for ERP.  It defines a new Diameter ERP application
   to transport ERP messages between an ER authenticator and the ER
   server, and a set of new AVPs that can be used to transport the
   cryptographic material needed by the re-authentication server.

Internet-Draft          Diameter ERP Application                May 2011


1.  Introduction

   RFC5296 [RFC5296] defines the EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP).
   It consists of the following steps:

   Bootstrapping

      A root key for re-authentication is derived from the Extended
      Master Session Key (EMSK) created during EAP authentication
      [RFC5295].  This root key is transported from the EAP server to
      the ER server.

   Re-authentication

      A one-round-trip exchange between the peer and the ER server,
      resulting in mutual authentication.  To support the EAP
      reauthentication functionality, ERP defines two new EAP codes -
      EAP-Initiate and EAP-Finish.

   This document defines how Diameter transports the ERP messages during
   the re-authentication process.  For this purpose, we define a new
   Application Identifier for ERP, and re-use the Diameter EAP commands
   (DER/DEA).

   This document also discusses the distribution of the root key during
   bootstrapping, in conjunction with either the initial EAP
   authentication (implicit bootstrapping) or the first ERP exchange
   (explicit bootstrapping).  Security considerations for this key
   distribution are detailed in RFC 5295 [RFC5295].

2.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology defined in RFC3748 [RFC3748], RFC5295
   [RFC5295], RFC5296 [RFC5296], and RFC4072 [RFC4072].

   "Root key" (RK) or "bootstrapping material" refer to the rRK or rDSRK
   derived from an EMSK, depending on the location of the ER server in
   home or foreign domain.

   We use the notation "ERP/DER" and "ERP/DEA" in this document to refer
   to Diameter-EAP-Request and Diameter-EAP-Answer commands with the
   Application Id set to "Diameter ERP Application" Section 11.1; the
   same commands are denoted "EAP/DER" and "EAP/DEA" when the
   Application Id in the message is set to "Diameter EAP Application"
   [RFC4072].

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Assumptions

   This document assumes the existence of at most one logical ER server
   entity in a domain.  If several physical servers are deployed for
   robustness, a replication mechanism must be deployed to synchronize
   the ERP states (root keys) between these servers.  This replication
   mechanism is out of the scope of this document.  If multiple ER
   servers are deployed in the domain, we assume that they can be used
   interchangeably.

4.  Protocol Overview

   The following figure shows the components involved in ERP, and their
   interactions.

           +-------------+   ERP   +-----------+  (*)  |  Home  |
   Peer <->|Authenticator|<=======>| ER server | <---> |  EAP   |
           +-------------+         +-----------+       | server |
                                                       +--------+
   (*) Diameter EAP application,  explicit bootstrapping scenario only.

                     Figure 1. Diameter ERP Overview.

   The ER server is located either in the home domain (same as EAP
   server) or in the visited domain (same as authenticator, when it
   differs from the home domain).

   When the peer initiates an ERP exchange, the authenticator creates a
   Diameter-EAP-Request message [RFC4072].  The Application Id of the
   message is set to that of the Diameter ERP application (code: TBD) in
   the message.  The generation of the ERP/DER message is detailed in
   Section 6.

   If there is an ER server in the same domain as the authenticator
   (local domain), Diameter routing must be configured so that this ERP/
   DER message reachs this server, even if the Destination-Realm is not
   the local domain.

   If there is no local ER server, the message is routed according to
   its Destination-Realm AVP content, extracted from the realm component
   of the keyName-NAI attribute.  As specified in RFC5296 [RFC5296],

Internet-Draft          Diameter ERP Application                May 2011


   this realm is the home domain of the peer in case of bootstrapping
   exchange ('B' flag is set in ERP message) or the domain of the
   bootstrapped ER server otherwise .

   If no ER server is available in the home domain either, the ERP/DER
   message cannot be delivered, and an error DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_DELIVER
   is generated as specified in [RFC3588] and returned to the
   authenticator.  The authenticator may cache this information (with
   limited duration) to avoid further attempts for ERP with this realm.
   It may also fallback to full EAP authentication to authenticate the
   peer.

   When an ER server receives the ERP/DER message, it searches its local
   database for a root key matching the keyName part of the User-Name
   AVP.  If such key is found, the ER server processes the ERP message
   as described in [RFC5296] then creates the ERP/DEA answer as
   described in Section 6.  The rMSK is included in this answer.

   Finally, the authenticator extracts the rMSK from the ERP/DEA as
   described in RFC5296 [RFC5296], and forwards the content of the EAP-
   Payload AVP, the EAP-Finish/Re-Auth message, to the peer.

   If the EAP-Initiate/Re-Auth message has its 'B' flag set
   (Bootstrapping exchange), the ER server should not possess the root
   key in its local database.  In this case, the ER server acts as a
   proxy, and forwards the message to the home EAP server after changing
   its Application Id to Diameter EAP and adding the ERP-RK-Request AVP
   to request the root key.  See section Section 5 for more detail on
   this process.

5.  Bootstrapping the ER Server

   The bootstrapping process involves the home EAP server and the ER
   server, but also impacts the peer and the authenticator.  In ERP, the
   peer must derive the same keying material as the ER server.  To
   achieve this, it must learn the domain name of the ER server.  How
   this information is acquired is outside the scope of this
   specification, but it may involves that the authenticator is
   configured to advertize this domain name, especially in the case of
   re-authentication after a handover.

   The bootstrapping of an ER server with a given root key happens
   either during the initial EAP authentication of the peer when the
   EMSK -- from which the root key is derived -- is created, during the
   first re-authentication, or sometime between those events.  We only
   consider the first two possibilities in this specification, in the
   following sub-sections.

5.1.  Bootstrapping During the Initial EAP authentication

   Bootstrapping the ER server during the initial EAP authentication
   (also known as implicit bootstrapping) offers the advantage that the
   server is immediatly available for re-authentication of the peer,
   thus minimizing the re-authentication delay.  On the other hand, it
   is possible that only a small number of peers will use re-
   authentication in the visited domain.  Deriving and caching key
   material for all the peers (for example, for the peers that do not
   support ERP) is a waste of resources and should be avoided.

   To achieve implicit bootstrapping, the ER server acts as a Diameter
   EAP Proxy , and Diameter routing must be configured so that Diameter
   EAP application messages are routed through this proxy.  The figure
   bellow illustrates this mechanism.

        Figure 2: ERP Bootstrapping During Full EAP Authentication

   The ER server proxies the first DER of the full EAP authentication
   and adds the ERP-RK-Request AVP inside, if this AVP is not already in
   the message (which might happen if there are several ER servers on
   the path), then forwards the request.

Internet-Draft          Diameter ERP Application                May 2011


   If the EAP server does not support the ERP extensions, it simply
   ignores the ERP-RK-Request AVP and continues as specified in RFC 4072
   [RFC4072].  If the server supports the ERP extensions, it saves the
   value of the ERP-Realm AVP found inside the ERP-RK-Request AVP, and
   continues with the EAP authentication.  When the authentication
   completes, if it is successful and the EAP method has generated an
   EMSK, the server MUST derive the rRK as specified in RFC 5296
   [RFC5296], using the saved domain name.  It then includes the rRK
   inside a Key AVP Section 8.3 with the Key-Type AVP set to rRK, before
   sending the DEA as usual.

   When the ER server proxies a Diameter-EAP-Answer message with a
   Session-Id corresponding to a message to which it added an ERP-RK-
   Request AVP, and the Result-Code is DIAMETER_SUCCESS, it MUST examine
   the message and save and remove any Key AVP Section 8.3 with Key-Type
   AVP set to rRK.  If the message does not contain such Key AVP, the ER
   server may cache the information that ERP is not possible for this
   session to avoid possible subsequent attempts.  In any case, the
   information stored in ER server concerning a session should not have
   a lifetime greater than the EMSK for this session.

   If the ER server is successfully bootstrapped, it should also add the
   ERP-Realm AVP after removing the Key AVP with Key-Type of rRK in the
   EAP/DEA message.  This ERP-Realm information can be used by the
   authenticator to notify the peer that ER server is bootstrapped, and
   for which domain.  How this information can be transmitted to the
   peer is outside the scope of this document.  This information needs
   to be sent to the peer if both implicit and explicit bootstrapping
   mechanisms are possible, because the ERP message and the root key
   used for protecting this message are different in bootstrapping
   exchanges and non-bootstrapping exchanges.

5.2.  Bootstrapping During the First Re-authentication

   Bootstrapping the ER server during the first re-authentication (also
   known as explicit bootstrapping) is less resource-consuming, since
   root keys are generated and cached only when needed.  On the other
   hand, in that case first re-authentication requires a one-round-trip
   exchange with the home EAP server, which is less efficient than the
   implicit bootstrapping scenario.

   The ER server receives the ERP/DER message containing the EAP-
   Initiate/Re-Auth message with the 'B' flag set.  It proxies this
   message, and performs the following processing in addition to
   standard proxy operations:

      Changes the Application Id in the header of the message to
      Diameter EAP Application (code 5).

Internet-Draft          Diameter ERP Application                May 2011


      Change the content of Application-Auth-Id accordingly.

      QUESTION: Is it better to leave it unmodified, so that the server
      can easily differenciate between ERP and standard EAP message?

      Add the ERP-RK-Request AVP, which contains the name of the domain
      where the ER server is located.

      PROBLEM: Add the Destination-Host AVP to reach the appropriate
      Diameter EAP server in case there is more than one in destination
      domain, the one with the EMSK.  How does the ER server know this
      information?  Or can we require that all Diameter EAP servers can
      be used interchangeably for this purpose?

   Then the proxied EAP/DER request is sent and routed to the home
   Diameter EAP server.

   If the home EAP server does not support ERP extensions, it replies
   with an error since the encapsulated EAP-Initiate/Re-auth command is
   not understood.  Otherwise, it processes the ERP request as described
   in [RFC5296].  In particular, it includes the Domain- Name TLV
   attribute with the content from the ERP-Realm AVP.  It creates the
   EAP/DEA reply message [RFC4072]. including an instance of the Key AVP
   Section 8.3 with Key-Type AVP set to rRK.

   The ER server receives this EAP/DEA and proxies it as follows, in
   addition to standard proxy operations:

      Set the Application Id back to Diameter ERPApplication Id (code
      TBD)

      Extract and cache the content of the Key AVP with Key-Type set to
      rRK, as described in implicit scenario.

   The ERP/DEA message is then forwarded to the authenticator, that can
   use the rMSK as described in RFC 5296 [RFC5296].

   The figure below captures this proxy behavior:

             Figure 4: Diameter ERP Re-authentication Exchange

   The peer sends an EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message to the ER server via
   the authenticator.  Alternatively, the authenticator may send an EAP-
   Initiate/Re-auth-Start message to the peer to trigger the mechanism.
   In this case, the peer responds with an EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message.

   If the authenticator does not support ERP (pure Diameter EAP
   [RFC4072] support), it discards the EAP packets with an unknown ERP-
   specific code (EAP-Initiate).  The peer should fallback to full EAP
   authentication in this case.

   When the authenticator receives an EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message from
   the peer, it process as described in [RFC5296] with regards to the
   EAP state machine.  It creates a Diameter EAP Request message
   following the general process of Diameter EAP [RFC4072], with the
   following differences:

      The Application Id in the header is set to Diameter ERP (code TBD
      ).

      The value in Auth-Application-Id AVP is also set to Diameter ERP
      Application.

      The keyName-NAI attribute from ERP message is used to create the
      content of User-Name AVP and Destination-Realm AVP.



      The Auth-Request-Type AVP content is set to [Editor's note: FFS].

      The EAP-Payload AVP contains the EAP-Initiate/Re-Auth.

   Then this ERP/DER message is sent as described in Section 4.

   The ER server receives and processes this request as described in
   Section 4.  It then creates an ERP/DEA message following the general
   processing described in RFC4072 [RFC4072], with the following
   differences:

      The Application Id in the header is set to Diameter ERP (code
      TBD).

      The value of the Auth-Application-Id AVP is also set to Diameter
      ERP Application.

      The EAP-Payload AVP contains the EAP-Finish/Re-auth message.

Internet-Draft          Diameter ERP Application                May 2011


      In case of successful authentication, an instance of the Key AVP
      containing the Re-authentication Master Session Key (rMSK) derived
      by ERP is included.

   When the authenticator receives this ERP/DEA answer, it processes it
   as described in Diameter EAP [RFC4072] and RFC5296 [RFC5296]: the
   content of EAP-Payload AVP content is forwarded to the peer, and the
   contents of the Keying-Material AVP [I-D.ietf-dime-local-keytran] is
   used as a shared secret for Secure Association Protocol.

7.  Application Id

   We define a new Diameter application in this document, Diameter ERP
   Application, with an Application Id value of TBD.  Diameter nodes
   conforming to this specification in the role of ER server MUST
   advertise support by including an Auth-Application-Id AVP with a
   value of Diameter ERP Application in the of the Capabilities-
   Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-Answer commands [RFC3588].

   The primary use of the Diameter ERP Application Id is to ensure
   proper routing of the messages, and that the nodes that advertise the
   support for this application do understand the new AVPs defined in
   Section 8 , although these AVP have the 'M' flag cleared.

8.  AVPs

   This section discusses the AVPs used by the Diameter ERP application.

8.1.  ERP-RK-Request AVP

   The ERP-RK-Request AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type grouped AVP.  This
   AVP is used by the ER server to indicate its willingness to act as ER
   server for a particular session.

   This AVP has the M and V bits cleared.

         ERP-RK-Request ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
                            { ERP-Realm }
                          * [ AVP ]

                       Figure 5: ERP-RK-Request ABNF

8.2.  ERP-Realm AVP

   The ERP-Realm AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type DiameterIdentity.  It
   contains the name of the realm in which the ER server is located.

   This AVP has the M and V bits cleared.

Internet-Draft          Diameter ERP Application                May 2011


8.3.  Key AVP

   The Key AVP [I-D.ietf-dime-local-keytran] is of type "Grouped" and is
   used to carry the rRK or rMSK and associated attributes.  The usage
   of the Key AVP and its constituent AVPs in this application is
   specified in the following sub-sections.

8.3.1.  Key-Type AVP

   The value of the Key-Type AVP MUST be set to 2 for rRK or 3 for rMSK.

8.3.2.  Keying-Material AVP

   The Keying-Material AVP contains rRK sent by the home EAP server to
   the ER server, in answer to a request containing an ERP-RK-Request
   AVP, or the rMSK sent by ER server to authenticator.  How this
   material is derived and used is specified in RFC 5296 [RFC5296].

8.3.3.  Key-Name AVP

   This AVP contains the EMSKname which identifies the keying material.
   The derivation of this name is specified in RGC 5296 [RFC5296].

8.3.4.  Key-Lifetime AVP

   The Key-Lifetime AVP contains the lifetime of the keying material in
   seconds.  It MUST NOT be greater than the remaining lifetime of the
   EMSK from which the material was derived.

9.  Open issues

   This document does not address some known issues in Diameter ERP
   mechanism.  The authors would like to hear ideas about how to address
   them.

   The main issue is the use of ERP for authentication after a handover
   of the peer to a new authenticator (or different authenticator port).
   Diameter ERP is not meant to be a mobility application.  A number of
   issues appear when we try to do handover while using Diameter ERP:

      how to manage the Session-Id AVP -- is it a new session each time,
      or do we try to reuse the same Diameter session?;

      how does the ER authenticator acquire the Authorization AVPs?  Is
      it cached in the Diameter ER server (received during
      bootstrapping) or do we use first Authenticate-Only with ER
      server, then Authorize-Only with home domain (and in that case how
      does the ER authenticator learn what the home domain is?)

Internet-Draft          Diameter ERP Application                May 2011


      how does the peer learn the ERP domain of the new authenticator --
      this is being addressed in HOKEY architecture draft;

      how does the home server reachs the peer to for example terminate
      the session if there is no notification sent to the home domain;

   Another issue concerns the case where the home realm contains several
   EAP servers.  In multi rounds full EAP authentication, the
   Destination-Host AVP provides the solution to reach the same server
   across the exchanges.  Only this server possess the EMSK for the
   session.  In case of explicit bootstrapping, the ER server must
   therefore be able to reach the correct server to request the DSRK.  A
   solution might consist in saving the Origin-Host AVP of all
   successful EAP/DEA in the ER server, which is a bit similar to the
   implicit bootstrapping scenario described here -- only we save the
   server name instead of the root key, and we must then be able to
   match the DSRK with the user name.

   In roaming environments, it might be useful that a broker provides
   ERP services.  The security implications of storing the DSRK
   generated for the visited domain into the broker's server should be
   studied.

   Finally, this document currently lacks a description of what happens
   when a Re-Auth-Request is received for a peer on the authenticator.

11.1.  Diameter Application Identifier

   This specification requires IANA to allocate a new value "Diameter
   ERP" in the "Application IDs" registry using the policy specified in
   Section 11.3 of RFC 3588 [RFC3588].

11.2.  New AVPs

   This specification requires IANA to allocate new values from the "AVP
   Codes" registry according to the policy specified in Section 11.1 of
   RFC 3588 [RFC3588] for the following AVPs:

      ERP-RK-Request

      ERP-Realm

   These AVPs are defined in Section 8.

12.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations from the following documents apply here:

   o  RFC3588 [RFC3588]

   o  RFC4072 [RFC4072]

   o  RFC5247 [RFC5247]

   o  RFC5295 [RFC5295]

   o  RFC5296 [RFC5296]

   FFS: Do we really respect these security considerations with the
   mechanism we describe here?  Is it safe to use ERP-RK-Request & Key
   AVPs?  What is the worst case?  For example if a domain tricks the
   peer into beliving it is located in a different domain?

   EAP channel bindings may be necessary to ensure that the Diameter
   client and the server are in sync regarding the key Requesting
   Entity's Identity.  Specifically, the Requesting Entity advertises
   its identity through the EAP lower layer, and the user or the EAP
   peer communicates that identity to the EAP server (and the EAP server
   communicates that identity to the Diameter server) via the EAP method
   for user/peer to server verification of the Requesting Entity's
   Identity.
