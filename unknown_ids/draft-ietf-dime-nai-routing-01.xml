    This specification clarifies the Diameter realm based request
    routing. We focus on the case where a Network Access Identifier in the
    User-Name AVP is used to populate the Destination-Realm AVP and
    the Network Access Identifier contains
    more than one realm. This particular case is possible when the
    Network Access Identifier decoration is used to force a routing of
    request messages through a predefined list of
    realms. However, this functionality is not unambiguously specified in the
    Diameter Base Protocol specification.

      <t>This specification clarifies the Diameter realm based request
         routing defined in RFC 3588 <xref target="RFC3588"/>. We focus
         on the case where the Network Access Identifier (NAI) <xref target="RFC4282"/> in the
         User-Name AVP is used to populate the Destination-Realm AVP and
         the NAI contains  more than one realm. This particular case is possible when the
         NAI decoration is used to force a routing of request messages through a predefined list of
         realms.
      </t>
      <t>According to the Diameter request routing processing rules in RFC 3588,
         the request originator may populate the Destination-Realm AVP
         with the realm part of the NAI available in the User-Name
         AVP. Unfortunately, there is no unambiguous mandatory language in RFC
         3588 how Diameter agents participating to the request routing should
         update the Destination-Realm AVP at each realm based on the content of
         the decorated NAI..
      </t>

      <t>This specification presents both the issue regarding to the
         Diameter realm based request routing with NAI decoration and
         also a solution for the problem. The
         solution would only apply to Diameter Base Protocol
         implementations that take the solution presented in this
         specification into account. The solution, however, is fully
         backwards compatible with the RFC 3588 Diameter Base Protocol.

    <section title="Problem Overview">
      <t>The Diameter Base Protocol RFC 3588 Section 6.1
         defines the request routing in detail. This specification
         concerns only those cases in which a Destination-Realm AVP is
         included in a request message.  A Diameter peer
         originating a request message MAY retrieve the realm information from
         the User-Name AVP and use that realm to populate the
         Destination-Realm AVP. In that case, the User-Name AVP contains
         a NAI in the form of "username@realm".
         The realm based request routing, as described in RFC 3588, does
         not discuss how to handle Decorated NAIs. The original NAI
         RFC 2486 <xref target="RFC2486"/> that RFC 3588 references
         to, does not defined how to construct a NAI with multiple 
         realms. Since then RFC 2486 has been obsoleted by RFC 4282
         which in turn defines how to construct Decorated NAIs.
      </t>
      <t>Decorated NAIs are used to force routing of messages to the home
         realm through a predefined list  of realms and in that way enable
         certain inter-realm roaming arrangements, see Section 2.7. of
         RFC 4282 <xref target="RFC4282"/>. For example, a terminal
         (e.g., a mobile host) learns based on some application or
         implementation  specific manner that its network access
         authentication signaling must go through certain realms
         in order to reach the home realm. In this case the terminal
         decorates its NAI during the network access
         authentication with the list of intermediating realms 
         and the home realm. As a result, the network access server
         (NAS) and intermediating Diameter agents will ensure that
         all subsequent request messages go through the desired
         realms as long as the request messages contain the User-Name
         AVP with a Decorated NAI.
      </t>

      <t>NAI Decoration has been previously used,
         for example, in RADIUS <xref target="RFC2865"/>
         based roaming networks using RFC 2486 NAIs in a proprietary
         manner. There is a 
         need to replicate the same NAI based routing enforcement
         functionality also in Diameter based roaming networks.
         There are also publicly available specifications (e.g., see
         <xref target="3GPP.23.234"/>, <xref target="3GPP.24.234"/>,
         <xref target="3GPP.23.003"/>, <xref target="3GPP.29.273"/> and
         <xref target="WiMAX"/>) that assume NAI Decoration
         based request routing enforcement is fully supported by RFC
         3588. The same assumption is carried over to NASREQ <xref
         target="RFC4005"/> and EAP <xref target="RFC4072"/> Diameter
         applications. 
      </t>
      <t><xref target="realms"/> illustrates an example of deployment scenario
         where Decorated NAIs is used to force a certain route through
         desired realms. A roaming terminal (e.g., a mobile host) discovers a
         number of Network Access Providers (NAP): NAP A and NAP B.
         None of the NAPs are able to provide direct connectivity to roaming
         terminals home realm (i.e. Realm-H). However, the roaming terminal
         learns, somehow, that NAP B is able to provide connectivity to the
         Realm-H through the Realm-X (i.e. the visited realm from the roaming
         terminal point of view). Therefore, for the network access authentication,
         the roaming terminal decorates its NAI as 
         Realm-H!username@Realm-X. The roaming terminal has also an alternative
         route to its home realm through NAP A, Realm-Z and Realm-X. If the roaming
         terminal had chosen to use NAP A, it would have decorated
         its NAI as Realm-X!Realm-H!username@Realm-Z. Diameter agents should now
         be able to route the request message through desired realms using
         the Decorated NAI originally found in the User-Name AVP.

      <t>NAI Decoration is not limited to the network access
         authentication and authorization procedures. It can be used
         with any Diameter application in which commands are proxiable
         and include the User-Name AVP with a NAI. Generally NAI Decoration can
         be used to force a certain route for all request messages at
         a realm granularity. 
      </t>

      <t>As a problem summary there are two main issues with the handling of
         Decorated NAI:

            done by intermediating Diameter agents that participate to
            realm based request routing. Specifically, this 
            concerns Diameter proxies.

         <t>How do Diameter agents implement the handling of the NAI
            Decoration based routing enforcement in a way that is
            still backwards compatible with RFC 3588.

    <section title="Solution Overview">
      <t>This specification defines a solution for Diameter realm
         based request routing with routing enforcement using the
         User-Name AVP NAI Decoration. Diameter proxy agent
         implementations can claim compliance using the solution
         described in this specification. 
      </t>

      <section title="Interpretation of Decorated NAIs">
        <t>Implementations compliant to this specification MUST have a
           uniform way of interpreting decorated NAIs. That is, in this
           case, the character '!' is used to separate
           realms in the list of decorated realms in the NAI (as shown
           in examples in <xref target="RFC4282"/>).

      </section>

      <section title="Enhanced Request Routing Solution" anchor="enhanced">
      <t>When a
         Diameter agent receives a request message containing a
         Destination-Realm AVP with a realm that the agent is configured to
         process locally (and, for Diameter proxies, the Diameter
         application is locally supported), it MUST do the following
         further processing before handling the message locally: 
      </t>
      <t><list style="symbols">
         <t>If the User-Name AVP is available in the request message,
            then the Diameter agent MUST inspect whether the User-Name
            AVP contains a Decorated NAI. If the NAI is not decorated
            then the Diameter agent proceeds with a normal RFC 3588
            message processing.
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
         </t>
         <t>If the User-Name AVP contains a Decorated NAI, then the
            Diameter agent MUST process the NAI as defined in RFC 4282
            and update the value of the User-Name AVP
            accordingly. Furthermore, the Diameter agent MUST update
            the Destination-Realm AVP to match the new realm part of the
            NAI in the User-Name AVP. 
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
         </t>
         <t>The request message is then sent to the next hop

         AVP and the Destination-Realm AVP change at each realm before
         reaching the final destination. If the signaling were
         originated from the NAS/NAP only, then the step 1) can be omitted.

      <t>Obviously, the functionality described in <xref
         target="enhanced"/> cannot be guaranteed to work with implementations
         based on RFC 3588 or any Diameter application strictly based on RFC 3588
         (such as NASREQ and
         EAP). An implementation not compliant with the present specification
         would automatically fall
         back to the normal RFC 3588 request routing
         behavior that, unfortunately, cannot offer desired enhanced
         request routing functionality. Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED 
         that the solution defined in this specification is only
         applied to newly specified Diameter applications. A Diameter
         agent MAY implement the solution defined in this
         specification also for the existing application. A Diameter
         client SHOULD NOT assume the functionality described in 
         <xref target="enhanced"/> from Diameter applications that do
         not comply with this specification.

        <t>This specification has no actions to IANA.

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>A malicious node initiating (or indirectly causing
         initiation of) a Diameter
         request may purposely create malformed list of realms in the
         NAI. This may cause the routing of requests through realms
         that would normally have nothing to do with the initiated
         Diameter message exchange. Furthermore, a malformed list of
         realms may contain non-existing realms causing the routing of
         Diameter messages that cannot ultimately be routed
         anywhere. However, the request message might get routed
         several hops before such non-existent realms are discovered
         and thus creating unnecessary overhead to the routing system
         in general.
      </t>
      <t>The NAI decoration is used in AAA infrastructures where the
         Diameter messages are transported between the NAS and the
         Diameter server via one or more AAA brokers or Diameter
         proxies.  In this case the NAS to the Diameter server AAA
         communication relies on the security properties of the
         intermediate AAA brokers and Diameter proxies.
