	This document requests IANA to recategorize several entries in
	the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Extended Communities registry
	from "Experimental Use" to non-experimental.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Extended Communities
	registry lists Extended Communities 0x8000-0x8fff as
	Experimental Use, in keeping
	with <xref target="RFC4360"></xref>.  In practice, the use of
	Extended Communities 0x8006-0x8009, defined
	in <xref target="RFC5575"></xref> and 0x800a, defined
	in <xref target="RFC4761"></xref> is not Experimental. The
	most straightforward solution to this problem is to
	recategorize those code points as Standards Action.
      </t>

      <!-- Don't need this.
      <t>
	The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
        NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
        "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
        in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.
      </t>
      </section> -->
    </section> 

    <section title="Discussion">
      <t>The other solution to this issue would be to update the 
      relevant specifications to use code points from the currently
      defined Standards Action space.  Given that there is 
      deployment of the currently-allocated code points, there would
      be non-negligible development, testing and operational expense to
      migrate to new code points, without any significant benefit
      being derived.  Given that there is no evident disadvantage to
      simply recategorizing the current code points, that solution is
      to be preferred.
