 Recommendations for the transition of email services from IPv4 to IPv6
                     for Internet Service Providers
            draft-oreirdan-rosenwald-ipv6-mail-transition-00

Abstract

   This document contains recommendations on how providers of email
   services can effect and manage the transition of email services from
   IPv4 to IPv6.  It is expected that this will be effected over a
   period of years and it is unlikely that any transition will
   completely exclude the ongoing possibility of using IPv4 as a
   transport mechanism for email.  This provides one possible plan for
   transitioning email services on the Internet from a predominantly
   IPv4-based connectivity model to a predominantly IPv6-based
   connectivity model.

Internet-Draft    Transition of email services to IPv6         July 2011


1.  Key Terminology

   This section defines the key terms used in this document.

1.1.  Email

   Email is a method of exchanging digital messages from an author to
   one or more recipients.

1.2.  Web mail

   A service which offers web based access to email services which would
   otherwise be accessed by dedicated email programs running on the
   device used to access the email.

1.3.  Host

   An end user's host, or computer, as used in the context of this
   document, is intended to refer to a computing device that connects to
   the Internet.  This encompasses devices used by Internet users such
   as personal computers, including laptops, desktops, and netbooks, as
   well as mobile phones, smart phones, home gateway devices, and other
   end user computing devices which are connected or can connect to the
   public Internet and/or private IP networks.

   Increasingly, other household systems and devices contain embedded
   hosts which are connected to or can connect to the public Internet
   and/or private IP networks.  However, these devices may not be under
   interactive control of the Internet user, such as may be the case
   with various smart home and smart grid devices.

1.4.  SMTP

   As defined in RFC2821

1.5.  POP

   As defined in RFC1939 and updated by RFCs 1957, 2449 and 6186


2.  Introduction and Problem Statement

   With the depletion of IPv4 address space and the transition of
   Internet infrastructure to IPv6, it is necessary to address the way
   in which email services can be transitioned from an IPv4 transport to
   that of IPv6.  It is anticipated that IPv4 will continue for a long
   time as a major transport mechanism for email services of all sorts.
   There are significant issues to be addressed around the matter of

   abuse in an IPv6 based environment which have been addressed and
   largely resolved when operating using IPv4 as a transport mechanism.
   The successful resolution of abuse issues may well be a key
   limitation on the transition of email to an IPv6 environment from the
   point of view of Internet Service providers.


3.  Important Notice of Limitations and Scope

   The issues of abuse specific to IPv6 are not yet fully resolved and
   will need much additional work.  The consideration given to abuse
   issues here should be considered as preliminary and incomplete.


4.  A Phased Transition Model

   It is not reasonable to specify the changes that each and every email
   system connected to the Internet must undergo in order to achieve the
   desired transition, as the number of connected systems precludes
   creating one plan that contains such a level of detail.  Further,
   while there are common scenarios that may be specified for
   transitioning individual email systems, the specific timeline and
   mechanisms utilized for a given email system will be unique.  Despite
   these challenges, it is necessary to coordinate expectations on an
   overall basis so that Internet-wide email services are maintained
   throughout the transition.  This document specifies a three-phase
   transition plan that includes preparation, transition, and post-
   transition phases, and delineates the necessary activities within
   each phase based on the role that an organization plays in the
   provision and use of email services.

   An important distinction made in this transition plan is identifying
   the explicit requirement for existing end-site organizations to add
   IPv6-based connectivity to their email servers during a transition
   phase.  An accelerated adoption of IPv6 for email servers enables new
   organizations in the post-transition phase to be connected to the
   Internet only via IPv6 and still have access to the overall set of
   email servers.

   For nearly every organization, the task of IPv6-enabling their email
   servers is far easier than undertaking an organization-wide adoption
   of IPv6.  Still, the requirement for existing Internet-connected
   organizations to add IPv6 connectivity (even to a small number of
   email systems) will be a significant hurdle and require a level of
   effort that may not be achievable given the lack of compelling
   additional benefits to these organizations [RFC1669].  This
   transition plan presumes that "connectivity is its own reward"
   [RFC1958] and that there still exists a sufficient level of

   cooperation among Internet participants to make this evolution
   possible.

   The three proposed phases are: Preparation Phase, Transition Phase,
   and Post-Transition Phase.


5.  Preparation Phase--Present to January 2013

   In the Preparation Phase, Service Providers pilot test their IPv6
   email services, and end-site organizations prepare to provide email
   services via IPv6-based connectivity while continuing to provide
   email services via IPv4 connectivity.  During the Preparation Phase,
   the following principles apply:

   PREP1: Service Providers SHOULD offer pilot IPv6-based email service
   to their Internet customers for outbound sending.  IPv6-based email
   services MAY be provided via IPv6 transition mechanisms (such as
   those described in [RFC4213], for example) or via native IPv6 network
   service.

   PREP2: Organizations SHOULD arrange for IPv6-based Internet
   connectivity for any Internet facing email servers sending or
   receiving email.  Internet-facing email servers in this phase SHOULD
   use separate service names per [RFC4472] to avoid impact to
   production IPv4-based services unless the organization supports
   production IPv6 connectivity.

   PREP3: Organizations MAY provide IPv6-based email services to
   internal user communities.


6.  Transition Phase--February 2013 to January 2014

   In the Transition Phase, Service Providers offer production IPv6 and
   IPv4 services to their Internet customers.  End-site organizations
   provide Internet-facing services in a production manner via IPv6-
   based connectivity in addition to IPv4-based connectivity.  During
   the Transition Phase, the following principles apply:

   TRANS1: Service Providers MUST offer IPv6-based email service to
   their Internet customers.  IPv6-based email service SHOULD be via
   native IPv6 network service but MAY be via IPv6 transition mechanisms
   if necessary.

   TRANS2: Organizations MUST arrange for IPv6-based Internet
   connectivity for any Internet-facing servers (e.g., web, email, and
   domain name servers).  Internet-facing IPv6 servers SHOULD be treated

   as production by the organization, and SHOULD be treated as
   production by other Internet organizations.

   TRANS3: Organizations SHOULD provide IPv6-based email service to
   their internal user communities.


7.  Post Transition Phase--February 2014 to the future

   In the Post-Transition Phase, end-site organizations MUST provide all
   email services via IPv6-based connectivity, thus allowing for new
   Internet customers connected solely by IPv6.  During the Post-
   Transition Phase, the following principles apply:

   POST1: Service Providers MUST offer IPv6-based email service to their
   Internet customers.  IPv6-based email service SHOULD be via native
   IPv6 network service.

   POST2: Organizations MUST arrange for IPv6-based Internet
   connectivity for any Internet-facing email servers.  Internet-facing
   IPv6 email servers MUST be treated as production by the organization,
   and SHOULD be treated as production by other Internet organizations.

   POST3: Organizations SHOULD provide IPv6-based email service to
   internal user communities.

   POST4: Service Providers MAY continue to offer IPv4-based email
   service to their Internet customers.  Organizations MAY continue to
   use IPv4-based email service.

11.  Issues specific to the handling of email inbound including abuse
     issues

   Domain Authentication will be required and will be utilizing the
   mechanisms outlined in RFC4871, RFC5585 and RFC5617

   Consideration should be given to a white-list environment for a
   limited number of email servers which are verified as belonging to
   authorized sources of email.  It is likely that these would be the
   email servers of large ISPs, well known email senders such as major
   Email service providers and other verified sources

   Given the scale of the IPv6 address space, the possibility that a
   connection exhaustion scenario may develop where the number of
   attempted connections to an individual email service may overwhelm
   its ability to provide service.  This may occur either deliberately
   as part of an abusive scenario or inadvertently due to
   misconfiguration.

   Common filtering techniques that are critical for early decision
   making such as real-time blocklists and IP reputation will need to be
   amended for practical use in an IPv6 environment.  Other reputation
   keys such as CIDR reputation and domain reputation should be
   considered.


12.  Issues specific to the handling of email outbound including abuse
     issues

   Submitting of unauthenticated port 25 mail to outbound IPv6 email
   servers MUST be prohibited.  User authentication MUST be required to
   allow users to submit email for delivery.

   In environments where IP reputation is tracked for outbound
   customers, this is likely to occur for ISPs that do not require
   authentication for sending email outbound.  Consideration will have
   to be made for tracking reputation per CIDR.  CIDR reputation would
   continue to track reputation at the lowest unit currently maintained
   which is the customer residence.

   Public announcement and aggregation of IPv6 addresses into the
   delegated CIDR blocks will be required for the purpose of identity
   identification.  CIDR reputation can then be applied to the whole
   entity.

   Throttling, particularly when off-net sending is allowed, should be
   considered.

Internet-Draft    Transition of email services to IPv6         July 2011


   Utilization of 6to4 conversion (modem to server (6) and server to
   external server (4)) can be an intermediate step as described above.
   Utilization of NAT technologies may also obscure the source IP
   address.

   Given the scale of the IPv6 address space, the possibility that a
   connection exhaustion scenario may develop where the number of
   attempted connections to an individual email service may overwhelm
   its ability to provide service.  This may occur either deliberately
   as part of an abusive scenario or inadvertently due to
   misconfiguration.


13.  Security Considerations

   This document does not address any security issues inherent in IPv6
   itself.  It acknowledges that there are as yet unresolved abuse
   issues specific to deploying email infrastructures based on an IPv6
   transport.  Abuse issues includes spam, phishing and spoofing of
   email addresses.


14.  Privacy Considerations

   This document describes at a high level activities that ISPs should
   be sensitive to, where the collection or communication of PII may be
   possible.  In addition, when performing this transition, ISPs should
   be careful to protect any PII collected whether deliberately or
   inadvertently.

   As noted, any sharing of data from the user to the ISP and/or
   authorized third parties should be done on an opt-in basis.
   Additionally the ISP and or authorized third parties should clearly
   state what data will be shared and with whom the data will be shared
   with.

   Lastly,there my be legal requirements in particular legal
   jurisdictions concerning how long any subscriber-related or other
   data is retained, of which an ISP operating in such a jurisdiction
   should be aware and with which an ISP should comply.


15.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations in this document.
