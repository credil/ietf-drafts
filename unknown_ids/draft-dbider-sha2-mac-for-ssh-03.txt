Abstract

   This memo defines algorithm names and parameters for use of some of
   the SHA-2 family of secure hash algorithms for data integrity
   verification in the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol.

   This document adds new Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithms
   to the set defined in RFC 4253 [RFC4253].

1.  Overview and Rationale

   SSH [RFC4251] is a very common protocol for secure remote login on
   the Internet.  Currently, SSH defines data integrity verification
   using SHA-1 and MD5 algorithms [RFC4253].  Due to recent security
   concerns with these two algorithms [RFC6151][RFC6194], implementors
   and users request support for data integrity verification using some
   of the SHA-2 family of algorithms.

   Please send comments on this draft to ietf-ssh@NetBSD.org.

1.1.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Data Integrity Algorithms

   This memo adopts the style and conventions of [RFC4253] in defining
   new data integrity algorithms.

   The following new data integrity algorithms are defined:

   hmac-sha2-256     RECOMMENDED   HMAC-SHA2-256
                                   (digest length = 32 bytes,
                                    key length    = 32 bytes)

   hmac-sha2-256-96  OPTIONAL      first 96 bits of HMAC-SHA2-256
                                   (digest length = 12 bytes,
                                    key length    = 32 bytes)

   hmac-sha2-512     OPTIONAL      HMAC-SHA2-512
                                   (digest length = 64 bytes,
                                    key length    = 64 bytes)

   hmac-sha2-512-96  OPTIONAL      first 96 bits of HMAC-SHA2-512
                                   (digest length = 12 bytes,
                                    key length    = 64 bytes)

Internet-Draft              SHA-2 MAC for SSH              November 2011


   The HMAC mechanism is defined in [RFC2104].

   The SHA-2 family of algorithms are defined in [FIPS-180-3].

   Sample code for the SHA-based HMAC algorithms are available in
   [RFC6234].  The variants HMAC-SHA2-224 and HMAC-SHA2-384 algorithms
   were considered, but not added to this list as they have the same
   computational requirements of HMAC-SHA2-256 and HMAC-SHA2-512
   respectively and do not seem to be much used in practise.

   Test vectors for use of HMAC with SHA-2 are provided in [RFC4231].

   Users, implementors, and administrators may choose to put these new
   Macs into the proposal ahead of the REQUIRED hmac-sha1 algorithm
   defined in [RFC4253] so that they would be negotiated first.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document augments the MAC Algorithm Names in [RFC4253] and
   [RFC4250].

   IANA is requested to updte the SSH algorithm registry with the
   following entries:

   MAC Algorithm Name      Reference       Note
   hmac-sha2-256           This draft      Section 2
   hmac-sha2-256-96        This draft      Section 2
   hmac-sha2-512           This draft      Section 2
   hmac-sha2-512-96        This draft      Section 2

                                 Figure 2

   Section 4.6.2 in [RFC4250] specifies that new names MUST be done
   through the IETF CONSENSUS method, as described in [RFC2434].

   Users, implementors, and administrators may choose to put these new
   Macs into the proposal ahead of the REQUIRED hmac-sha1 algorithm
   defined in [RFC4253] so that they would be negotiated first.


4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of RFC 4253 [RFC4253] apply to the is
   document.

   The current attacks on HMAC-SHA1 do not yet seem to indicate a
   practical vulnerability when used as a message authentication code.

Internet-Draft              SHA-2 MAC for SSH              November 2011


   NIST publications NIST SP 800-107 [800-107] and NIST SP 800-131
   [800-131] suggest that HMAC-SHA1 and HMAC-SHA2-256 have a security
   strength of 128 bits and 256 bits respectively.

   Even so, many users seem to be interested in the perceived safety of
   using a stronger algorithm.
