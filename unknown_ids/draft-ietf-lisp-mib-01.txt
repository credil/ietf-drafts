1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   This draft describes the Management Information Base (MIB) module for
   use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   Specifically, the MIB for managing Locator/ID Separation Protocol
   (LISP) devices is described.

   LISP [LISP] specifies a network-based architecture and mechanisms
   that implement a new semantic for IP addressing using two separate
   name spaces: Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs), used within sites, and
   Routing Locators (RLOCs), used on the transit networks that make up
   the Internet infrastructure.  To achieve this separation, LISP
   defines protocol mechanisms for mapping from EIDs to RLOCs.  In
   addition, LISP assumes the existence of a database to store and
   globally propagate those mappings [LISP-MS] [LISP-ALT].

   From a data plane perspective, LISP traffic is handled exclusively at
   the network layer by devices performing Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR)
   and Egress Tunnel Router (ETR) LISP functions.  Data plane operations
   performed by these devices are described in [LISP].  Additionally,
   data plane interworking between legacy (Internet) and LISP sites is
   implemented by devices performing Proxy ITR (PITR) and Proxy ETR
   (PETR) functions.  The data plane operations of these devices is
   described in [INTERWORK].

   From a control plane perspective, LISP employs mechanisms related to
   creating, maintaining, and resolving mappings from EIDs to RLOCs.
   LISP ITRs, ETRs, PITRs, and PETRs perform specific control plane
   functions, and these control plane operations are described in
   [LISP].  Additionally, LISP infrastructure devices supporting LISP
   control plane functionality include Map-Servers and Map-Resolvers,
   and the control plane operations of these devices are described in
   [LISP-MS].  Finally, while not specifically required, this document
   assumes that a LISP+ALT database mapping infrastructure exists as
   part of the LISP control plane.  The control plane operations of the
   ALT are described in [LISP-ALT].  Note that this MIB does not provide
   support for the ALT since ALT statistics may be obtained through
   existing BGP and tunnel MIBs.

3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

4.  Definition of Terms

   Endpoint ID (EID):  a 32-bit (for IPv4) or 128-bit (for IPv6) value
      used in the source and destination address fields of the first
      (inner-most) IP header of a LISP packet.  A source EID is
      allocated to a host from an EID-prefix block associated with the
      site where the host is located.  A host determines a destination
      EID in the same way that it determines a destination address
      today, for example through a DNS lookup or SIP exchange.

   Routing Locator (RLOC):  a 32-bit (for IPv4) or 128-bit (for IPv6)
      value used in the source and destination address fields of the
      second (outer-most) IP header of a LISP packet.  RLOC addresses
      are allocated to an egress tunnel router (ETR) and numbered from
      topologically-aggregatable blocks assigned to a site at each point
      to which it attaches to the global Internet.

   EID-to-RLOC Map-Cache:  a short-lived, on-demand table maintained
      locally in an ITR or PITR that stores, tracks, and is responsible
      for timing-out and otherwise validating EID-to-RLOC mappings.
      This table is distinct from the full "database" of EID-to-RLOC
      mappings in that it is dynamic and relatively small.  At a given
      moment in time, it consists only of entries for those sites to
      which the ITR or PITR is currently communicating or has
      communicated with within the configured TTL period.

   EID-to-RLOC Mapping-Database:  a global distributed database that
      contains all known EID-to-RLOC mappings.  Each potential ETR
      typically contains a small piece of the database consisting of
      only the EID-to-RLOC mappings for the EID prefix(es) for which the
      ETR is "authoritative" and the RLOC(s) by which those EID
      prefix(es) are reachable from the global Internet.

Internet-Draft                  LISP MIB                      March 2011


   Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR):  a router that accepts an IP packet with
      a single IP header (more precisely, an IP packet that does not
      contain a LISP header), treats this "inner" IP destination address
      as an EID and performs an EID-to-RLOC mapping lookup, and then
      prepends an "outer" IP header with one of its own globally-
      routable RLOCs in the source address field and the RLOC resulting
      from the mapping lookup in the destination address field.  That
      is, in general an ITR receives an IP packet from site end-systems
      on one side and sends a LISP-encapsulated IP packet toward the
      Internet on the other side.

   Egress Tunnel Router (ETR):  a router that accepts an IP packet where
      the destination address in the "outer" IP header is one of its own
      RLOCs, strips the "outer" header, and forwards the packet based on
      the next IP header found.  That is, in general an ETR receives
      LISP-encapsulated IP packets from the Internet on one side and
      sends decapsulated IP packets toward site end-systems on the other
      side.

   xTR:  is a general reference to an ITR or ETR when direction of data
      flow is not part of the context description. xTR refers to the
      router that is the tunnel endpoint and performs both ITR and ETR
      functionality.  For example, "An xTR can be located at the
      Customer Edge (CE) router", meaning both ITR and ETR functionality
      is activated at the CE router.

   Proxy ITR (PITR):  a router that acts like an ITR but does so on
      behalf of non-LISP sites which send packets to destinations at
      LISP sites.  The PITR, also known as a PTR, is defined and
      described in [INTERWORK].

   Proxy ETR (PETR):  a router that acts like an ETR but does so on
      behalf of LISP sites which send packets to destinations at non-
      LISP sites.  The PETR is defined and described in [INTERWORK].

   LISP Site:  is a set of routers in an edge network that are under a
      single technical administration.  LISP routers which reside in the
      edge network are the demarcation points to separate the edge
      network from the core network.

   Map-Server:  a LISP network infrastructure component which learns
      EID-to-RLOC mapping entries from an authoritative source such as
      an ETR though static configuration, or another out-of-band
      mechanism.  A Map-Server advertises these mappings into the
      distributed mapping database such as that described in [LISP-ALT].

Internet-Draft                  LISP MIB                      March 2011


   Map-Resolver:  a LISP network infrastructure component which accepts
      LISP Encapsulated Map-Requests, typically from an ITR, and quickly
      determines whether or not the destination IP address is part of
      the EID namespace.  If it is, the Map-Resolver finds the
      appropriate EID-to-RLOC mapping by consulting the distributed
      mapping database system such as that described in [LISP-ALT].  If
      it is not, a Negative Map-Reply is immediately returned.

   Map-Reply:  a LISP Map-Reply message type returned in response to a
      Map-Request for a destination EID that exists in the mapping
      database and contains the locator-set and associated policy for
      the queried EID.  Information returned in a Map-Reply is stored in
      the EID-to-RLOC Map-Cache.

   Negative Map-Reply:  a LISP Map-Reply message type that contains an
      empty locator-set.  Returned in response to a Map-Request if the
      destination EID does not exist in the mapping database.
      Typically, this means that the "EID" being requested is an IP
      address connected to a non-LISP site.  Information returned in a
      Negative Map-Reply is stored in the EID-to-RLOC Map-Cache.

   LISP+ALT:  a static network built using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP,
      [RFC4271]), BGP multi-protocol extension [RFC4760], and Generic
      Routing Encapsulation (GRE, [RFC2784]) to construct an overlay
      network of devices (ALT Routers) which operate on EID-prefixes and
      use EIDs as forwarding destinations.  This LISP+ALT network may,
      but is not required to be, used by LISP to find EID-to-RLOC
      mappings.  LISP+ALT is described in [LISP-ALT].

5.  LISP MIB Objectives

   The objectives for defining this LISP MIB module are as follows:

   o  Provide a means for obtaining a list of enabled LISP features and
      the current status of configuration attributes related to those
      features.  As an example, LISP capabilities which could be enabled
      include ITR, ETR, PITR, PETR, MS or MR support for IPv4 or IPv6
      address families.  Other examples include, indicating whether
      rloc-probing is enabled, and indicating the configured map-cache
      limit value.

   o  Provide a means for obtaining the current attributes of various
      LISP tables, such as the EID-to-RLOC policy data contained in the
      Map-Cache, or the local EID-to-RLOC policy data contained in the
      Mapping-Database.

   o  Provide a means for obtaining the current operational statistics
      of various LISP functions, such as the number of packets

      encapsulated and decapsulated by the device.  Other counters of
      operational interest, depending on LISP function, include things
      like the current number of map-cache entries, and the total number
      and rate of map-requests received and sent.

6.  Structure of LISP MIB Module

6.1.  Overview of Defined Notifications

   No LISP MIB notifications are defined.

6.2.  Overview of Defined Tables

   The LISP MIB module is composed of ten tables of objects, as follows:

   Lisp -  This table provides information representing the various lisp
      features that can be enabled on LISP devices.

   LispMappingDatabase -  This table represents the EID-to-RLOC database
      that contains the EID-prefix to RLOC mappings configured on an
      ETR.  In general, this table would be representative of all such
      mappings for a given site that this device belongs to.

   LispMappingDatabaseLocator -  This table represents the set of
      routing locators contained in the EID-to-RLOC database configured
      on an ETR.

   LispMapCache -  This table represents the short-lived, on-demand
      table on an ITR that stores, tracks, and is responsible for
      timing-out and otherwise validating EID-to-RLOC mappings.

   LispMapCacheLocator -  This table represents the set of locators per
      EID prefix contained in the map-cache table of an ITR.

   LispSite -  This table provides the properties of each lisp site that
      is served by this device when configured to be a Map-Server.

   LispSiteLocator -  This table provides the properties of all locators
      per lisp site that is served by this device when configured to be
      a Map-Server.

   LispMapServers -  This table provides the properties of all Map-
      Servers that this device is configured to use.

   LispMapResolvers -  This table provides the properties of all Map-
      Resolvers that this device is configured to use.

         the following four-tuple:
          1. IANA Address Family Number: A field of length
             2-octets, whose value is of the form following the
             assigned AddressFamilyNumbers textual-convention
             described in [IANA]. The enumerations are listed
             in [IANA].  Note that this list of address family
             numbers is maintained by IANA.
          2. Length of LISP address: A field of length 1-octet,
             whose value indicates the octet-length of the next
             (third) field of this LispAddressType four-tuple.
          3. Lisp address: A field of variable length as
             indicated in the previous (second) field, whose
             value is an address of the IANA Address Family
             indicated in the first field of this LispAddressType
             four-tuple.  Note that any of the IANA Address
             Families can be represented. Particularly when the
             address family is LISP Canonical Address Format
             (LCAF) [LCAF] with IANA assigned Address Family
             Number 16387, then the first octet of this field
             indicates the LCAF type, and the rest of this field
             is same as the encoding format of the LISP Canonical
             Address after the length field, as defined in [LCAF].
          4. Mask-length of address: A variable-length field
             comprised of the remaining octets of this
             LispAddressType four-tuple, whose value is the
             mask-length to be applied to the lisp address
             specified in the previous (third) field.

          To illustrate the use of this object, consider the
          LISP MIB Object below entitled lispMapCacheEntry.
          This object begins with the following entities:

          lispMapCacheEntry ::= SEQUENCE {
             lispMapCacheEidLength          INTEGER,
             lispMapCacheEid                LispAddressType,
             ---[skip]---

          Example 1: Suppose that the IPv4 EID prefix stored is
          10.10.10.0/24. In this case, the values within
          lispMapCacheEntry would be:

             lispMapCacheEidLength  = 8
             lispMapCacheEid = 1, 4, 10.10.10.0, 24
             ---[skip]---

          where 8 is the total length in octets of the next
          object (lispMapCacheEID of type LispAddressType). Then,
          the value 1 indicates the IPv4 AF (per [IANA]), the



Schudel, et al.        Expires September 12, 2011               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                  LISP MIB                      March 2011


          value 4 indicates that the AF is 4-octets in length,
          10.10.10.0 is the IPv4 address, and the value 24 is the
          mask-length in bits. Note that the lispMapCacheEidLength
          value of 8 is used to compute the length of the fourth
          (last) field in lispMapCacheEid to be 1 octet -- as
          computed by 8 - (2 + 1 + 4) = 1.

          Example 2: Suppose that the IPv6 EID prefix stored is
          2001:db8:a::/48. In this case, the values within
          lispMapCacheEntry would be:

             lispMapCacheEidLength  = 20
             lispMapCacheEid = 2, 16, 2001:db8:a::, 48

          where 20 is the total length in octets of the next
          object (lispMapCacheEID of type LispAddressType). Then,
          the value 2 indicates the IPv4 AF (per [IANA]), the
          value 16 indicates that the AF is 16-octets in length,
          2001:db8:a:: is the IPv6 address, and the value 48 is the
          mask-length in bits. Note that the lispMapCacheEidLength
          value of 20 is used to compute the length of the fourth
          (last) field in lispMapCacheEid to be 1 octet -- as
          computed by 20 - (2 + 1 + 16) = 1.

          Example 3: As an example where LCAF is used, suppose
          that the IPv4 EID prefix stored is 10.10.10.0/24 and it
          is part of LISP instance id 101. In this case, the values
          within lispMapCacheEntry would be:

             lispMapCacheEidLength  = 11
             lispMapCacheEid = 16387, 7, 2, 101, 1, 10.10.10.0, 24
             ---[skip]---

          where 11 is the total length in octets of the next object
          (lispMapCacheEID of type LispAddressType). Then, the value
          16387 indicates the LCAF AF (see [IANA]), the value 7
          indicates that the LCAF AF is 7-octets in length in this
          case, 2 indicates that LCAF Type 2 encoding is used (see
          [LCAF]), 101 gives the instance id, 1 gives the AFI (per
          [IANA]) for an IPv4 address, 10.10.10.0 is the IPv4
          address, and 24 is the mask-length in bits. Note that the
          lispMapCacheEidLength value of 11 octets is used to compute
          the length of the last field in lispMapCacheEid to be 1 octet,
          as computed by 11 - (2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4) = 1."

Internet-Draft                  LISP MIB                      March 2011


8.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

8.1.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The LISP MIB imports the textual-convention AddressFamilyNumbers from
   the IANA-ADDRESS-FAMILY-NUMBERS-MIB [IANA].

9.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  As long as
   these MIB modules are implemented correctly, there are no risks that
   any management objects of this MIB module can modify device settings
   via direct SNMP SET operations.

   There are no readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with
   a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) that are considered
   sensitive.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of these MIB modules is properly configured to give access
   to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

10.  IANA Considerations

   LISP is an experimental protocol and the LISP MIB is an experimental
   MIB.  No IANA actions are required by this document.
