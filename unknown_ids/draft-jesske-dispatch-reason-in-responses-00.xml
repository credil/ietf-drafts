    <abstract>
      <t>Although the use of the Reason header in responses is considered in
      RFC3326, doing so is not specified for any existing response code. This
      document specifies the use of the Reason header field in SIP responses
      to carry Q.850 reason codes for the failure of an INVITE. Although the
      use of the Reason header field in responses is considered in RFC3326,
      doing so is not specified for any existing response code. Nonetheless,
      the Reason header field has been widely used in responses to carry Q.850
      reason codes for failure responses to INVITEs that have been gatewayed
      to PSTN systems. This document specifies and formally permits the use of
      the Reason header field in SIP responses to carry Q.850 reason codes for
      this and other purposes.</t>

      <t>This document uses terms from <xref target="RFC3261"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Overview ">
      <t>With introducing the Session Initiation Protocol <xref
      target="RFC3261"></xref>into the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) which is
      defined by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project the it was required to
      interoperate with the PSTN/ISDN. The European Telecommunication
      Standards Institute (ETSI) has defined a Next Generation Network (NGN)
      where a substantial part of it is based on the IMS.</t>

      <t>ETSI has developed a number of requirements to support the usage of
      SIP in Next Generation Networks that interoperate, at the service level,
      with the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), the Integrated
      Services Digital Network (ISDN), the 3GPP IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS),
      and SIP networks and terminals that implement the service logic.</t>

      <t>Also ITU-T has specified an interworking between SIP and PSTN/ISDN
      networks <xref target="ITU.Q1912.5.2004"></xref> where reason within
      responses are allready supported.</t>

      <t>In order to provide full support in SIP of existing services,
      extensions to SIP are needed.</t>

      <t>This document proposes the use of the Reason header field in
      responses. This is needed for creating services that must be
      interoperable with the PSTN/ISDN network and the interoperability of
      traversing communications through SIP not using SIP-I.</t>

      <t>The main used case for reason header within responses are
      interworking situations with PSTN/ISDN networks where the ISUP cause In
      many cases the mapping of specific cause values will result in a generic
      SIP Response like it is shown below.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC3398"></xref> and other Interworking specifications
      like <xref target="3GPP.29.163"></xref> are describing the mapping of
      ISUP Cause Values to SIP and vice versa. Looking on the specific mapping
      shows that information will be lost when the call traverses ISUP without
      using SIP-T.</t>

      <t>Example:</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC3398"></xref> describes the mapping of following
      ISUP Causes to 503 and 408 like follows.</t>

      <t><figure>
          <preamble></preamble>

      <t>The Example with 503 shows that a couple of different ISUP Cause
      values are interworked to only one SIP response. With 408 the meaning of
      the release cause is changed when interworked back to ISUP. Also
      Services built on Cause 18 (e.G. a 2nd call attempt on an other number,
      this service is like a sequential forking) will not work.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements">
      <t>REQ-1:</t>

      <t>It should be possible to support PSTN-SIP-PSTN scenarios where the
      reason of a call release can be transferred though the SIP domain
      without any loss of information and no change of reason.</t>

      <t>REQ-2:</t>

      <t>It should be possible to provide correct announcements to a SIP user
      based on the reason for call clearing within the PSTN network or the
      PSTN user. The PSTN does normally not provide announcements to
      originating user when clearing the call.</t>

      <t>REQ-3:</t>

      <t>A UA may have the ability to display ISUP specific release causes or
      show a equivalent text. A inclusion of <xref target="Q.850"></xref>
      causes is out of scope.</t>

      <t>REQ-4:</t>

      <t>A application server providing specific PSTN like services may have
      the possibility to include ISUP specific release causes</t>

      <section title="Used Cases for the requirements">
        <t>REQ-1 shows the scenario between two ISUP Gateways where SIP-I is
        not a solution to be used. A IMS network defined by 3GPP where SIP-I
        is not part of the framework is such an example. A used case is shown
        in Figure 2.</t>

        <t>REQ-2 identifies the scenario the gateway passes on the cause and
        some announcement server translates the cause into the appropriate
        announcement.</t>

        <t>REQ-3 excludes that a SIP UA includes <xref target="Q.850"></xref>
        cause values because that is not needed due to the different context
        of a SIP UA and of course the existing SIP response codes. Also the
        possibility of displaying Q.850 causes should be used very restrictive
        and is not recommended. A used case could be a used case could be a
        Integrated Access Device where a POTS Phone is connected to. It is
        recommended to ignore the cause value if received be a UA.</t>

        <t>REQ-4: allows an Apllication Server that is providing specific
        Services simulating PSTN services to include Q.850 Causes. This is
        needed specific for IMS operartors which are substituting their PSTN
        to IMS. These operators may run Services in the SIP domain that are
        provided to PSTN endusers.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Overall Applicability">
      <t>The SIP procedures specified in this document are foreseen for
      networks providing simulation services and/or interworking to the
      PSTN/ISDN.</t>

      <t>The document is describing the use of the Reason header in SIP
      responses. These procedures are only valuable if the reason contained in
      the element "protocol" is "Q.850". A inclusion of a SIP reason
      (protocol="SIP") is not helpful due to the fact that the response
      already provides the SIP reason. The Release Causes are described within
      <xref target="Q.850"></xref>. (Note: The ETSI specifications can be
      downloaded under http://pda.etsi.org/pda/queryform.asp free of
      charge.)</t>

      <t>The appearance of the Reason header is applicable to final responses
      4xx, 5xx and 6xx and in addition for 199 Responses as defined within
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-sipcore-199"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Procedures">
      <section title="Procedures at the UA">
        <t>A UA that supports the Reason header field can process the <xref
        target="Q.850"></xref> Cause Value and display it or an equivalent
        text. The inclusion of a Reason header field by UA is only for B2B UA
        interworking with the PSTN/ISDN or providing services foreseen.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Procedures at a SIP proxy">
        <t>SIP proxies that receive a response containing a Reason header
        field is forwarding the response without changing the reason.</t>

        <t>A SIP proxy receiving a request that includes a Reason header field
        can route the request to an application server for further analysis
        and base services on it.</t>

        <t>Based on network policy a Proxy can remove a Reason header field
        send from a UAC.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Procedures at an application server">
        <t>An application server that receives a SIP request that contains a
        response including a Reason header MAY analyze the SIP Reason and base
        further procedures on this analyses.</t>

        <t>For Example the application server could use the reason for sending
        a announcement towards the originating entity of the session.</t>

        <t>As an example the Anonymous Communication Rejection (ACR) service
        defined by ETSI Telecommunications and Internet converged Services and
        Protocols for Advanced Networking (TISPAN)</t>

      <t>For interoperability reasons the Q.850 Cause Value of a Release shall
      be mapped to the Reason Header.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The presence of the Reason header in a response does not affect the
      treatment of the response.</t>

      <t>Including such a header by an untrusted entity could adulterate the
      reactions of the originating entities. E.G. sending back a cause value
      "87" can cause an announcement within the PSTN/ISDN saying that the call
      was rejected due to the Closed User Group service.</t>

      <t>Therefore it is RECOMMENDED to include the Reason header information
      in Responses only by trusted entities as it is described within <xref
      target="RFC3325"></xref>.</t>
