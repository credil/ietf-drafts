Abstract

   When deploying IPv6, whether IPv6-only or dual-stack, routers are
   configured to send IPv6 Router Advertisements to convey information
   to nodes that enable them to autoconfigure on the network.  This
   information includes the implied default router address taken from
   the observed source address of the Router Advertisement (RA) message.
   However, unintended misconfigurations or possibly malicious attacks
   on the network may lead to bogus RAs being present, which in turn can

   cause operational problems for hosts on the network.  In this draft
   we summarise the scenarios in which rogue RAs may be observed and
   present a list of possible solutions to the problem.  The goal of
   this text is to be Informational, and as such to present a framework
   around which solutions can be proposed and discussed.

Internet-Draft      Rogue IPv6 Router Advertisements       November 2008


1.  Introduction

   The Neighbor Discovery protocol [7] describes the operation of IPv6
   Router Advertisements (RAs), which are used during the IPv6
   autoconfiguration process, whether a node's configuration is stateful
   (via DHCPv6 [2]) or stateless (as per RFC4862 [8], possibly in
   combination with DHCPv6 Light [3]).

   In observing the operation of deployed IPv6 networks, it is apparent
   that there is a problem with undesired or 'bogus' IPv6 Router
   Advertisements (RAs) appearing on network links or subnets.  By
   'bogus' we mean RAs that were not the intended configured RAs, rather
   RAs that have appeared for some other reason.

   The problem with rogue RAs is that they can cause partial or complete
   failure of operation of hosts on an IPv6 link.  For example, the
   default router address is drawn directly from the source address of
   the RA message.  As such, rogue RAs are an operational issue for
   which solution(s) are required, and for which best practice needs to
   be conveyed.  This not only includes preventing or detecting rogue
   RAs, but also where necessary the ability to quickly recover from a
   state where host configuration is incorrect as a result of processing
   such an RA.

   In the next section, we discuss the scenarios that may give rise to
   rogue RAs being present.  In the following section we present some
   candidate solutions for the problem, some of which may be more
   practical to deploy than others.


2.  Bogus RA Scenarios

   There are three broad classes of scenario in which bogus RAs may be
   introduced to an IPv6 network.

2.1.  Administrator misconfiguration

   Here an administrator incorrectly configures RAs on a router
   interface, causing incorrect RAs to appear on links and hosts to
   generate incorrect or unintended IPv6 address, gateway or other
   information.  In such a case the default gateway may be correct, but
   a host might for example become multi-addressed, possibly with a
   correct and incorrect address based on a correct and incorrect
   prefix.  There is also the possibility of other configuration
   information being misconfigured, such as the lifetime option.

   In the case of a Layer 2 VLAN misconfiguration, RAs may 'flood' to
   unintended links, causing hosts or more than one link to potentially



Chown & Venaas             Expires May 7, 2009                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft      Rogue IPv6 Router Advertisements       November 2008


   become incorrectly multiaddressed, with possibly two different
   default routers available.

2.2.  User misconfiguration

   In this case a user's device 'accidentally' transmits RAs onto the
   local link, adding an additional default gateway and associated
   prefix information.

   This seems to typically be seen on wireless (though sometimes wired)
   networks where a laptop has enabled the Windows Internet Connection
   Sharing service (ICS) which turns a host into a 6to4 [1] gateway;
   this can be a useful feature, unless of course it is run when not
   intended.  We have had reports that hosts may not see the genuine RAs
   on link due to host firewalls, and then turning on a connection
   sharing service and 6to4 as a result.  In some cases more technical
   users may also use a laptop as a home gateway (e.g. again a 6to4
   gateway) and then connect to another network with the gateway
   configuration still active.

   There are also reported incidents in enterprise networks of users
   physically plugging Ethernet cables into the wrong sockets and
   bridging two subnets together, causing an problem similar to VLAN
   flooding.

2.3.  Malicious misconfiguration

   Here an attacker is deliberately generating RAs on the local network
   in an attempt to perform some form of denial of service or man-in-
   the-middle attack.


3.  Methods to Mitigate against Rogue RAs

   In this section we present a summary of methods suggested to date for
   reducing or removing the possibility of rogue RAs being seen on a
   network.

3.1.  Manual configuration

   The default gateway and host address can usually be manually
   configured on a device.  This is of course a resource intensive
   solution, and also prone to administrative mistakes in itself.

3.2.  Secure Neighbor Discovery

   The SeND [4] protocol provides a method for hosts and routers to
   perform secure Neighbor Discovery.  At present there are very few

Internet-Draft      Rogue IPv6 Router Advertisements       November 2008


   SeND implementations available, and SeND is perceived as a complex
   protocol to deploy.  It is also likely that not all scenarios will be
   able to use SeND, for various reasons.  In particular SeND may be
   best suited for fully managed enterprise networks, rather than those
   where administrative control is not present.

3.3.  Introduce RA snooping

   It should be possible to implement 'RA snooping' in Layer 2 switches
   in a similar way to DHCP snooping, such that RAs observed from
   incorrect sources are blocked or dropped, and not propagated through
   a subnet.  One candidate solution in this space called RA-Guard [9]
   has recently been proposed.  This type of solution has appeal because
   it is a familiar model for enterprise network managers, but it can
   also be used to complement SeND.

   This type of solution may not be applicable everywhere, e.g. in
   environments where there are not centrally controlled switches.

3.4.  Use ACLs on Managed Switches

   Certain switch platforms can already implement some level of rogue RA
   filtering by the administrator configuring Access Control Lists
   (ACLs) that block RA ICMP messages that might be inbound on 'user'
   ports.  Again this type of 'solution' depends on the presence of such
   configurable switches.

3.5.  Use the Router Preference Option

   RFC4191 [5] introduced router preference options, such that an RA
   could carry one of three router preference values: High, Medium
   (default) or Low. Thus an administrator could use High settings for
   managed RAs, and hope that 'accidental' RAs would be medium priority.
   This of course would only work in some scenarios - an attacker would
   certainly seek to use High priority anyway - and would also rely on
   clients having implementations of the protocol.

3.6.  Rely on Layer 2 admission control

   In principle, if a technology such as IEEE 802.1x is used, devices
   would first need to authenticate to the network before being able to
   send or receive IPv6 traffic.  Ideally authentication would be
   mutual.

   Improving Layer 2 security may help to mitigate against a malicious
   attacker's capability to join the network to send RAs, but it doesn't
   prevent misconfiguration issues.

Internet-Draft      Rogue IPv6 Router Advertisements       November 2008


3.7.  Use host-based packet filters

   In a managed environment hosts could be configured via their
   'personal firewall' to only accept RAs from trusted sources.  Hosts
   could also potentially be configured to discard 6to4-based RAs in a
   managed enterprise environment.

   However, the problem is then pushed to keeping this configuration
   maintained and correct.  If a router fails and is replaced, possibly
   with a new Layer 2 interface address, the link local source address
   in the filter may become incorrect and no thus no method would be
   available to push the new information to the host over the network.

3.8.  Use an 'intelligent' deprecation tool

   It could be possible to run a daemon on a link (perhaps on the router
   on the link) to watch for incorrect RAs and to send a deprecating RA
   with router lifetime of zero when such an RA is observed.  The KAME
   rafixd is an example of such a tool, which has been used at IETF
   meetings with some success.  A slightly enhanced ramond has since
   been developed from this code.  As with host based firewalling, the
   daemon would need to somehow know what 'good' and 'bad' RAs are, from
   some combination of known good sources and/or link prefixes.

   In contrast, an attacker might use such a tool to learn about
   prefixes being advertised on a link and to deprecate the 'good' RA(s)
   in favour of their bogus RA(s).

   Whether or not use of such a tool is the preferred method, monitoring
   a link for observed RAs seems prudent from a network management
   perspective.  Some such tools exist already, e.g. ndpmon.

3.9.  Wait before using new advertisements

   It might be possible, in networks where configurations are very
   static and systems generally remain up, to configure an option such
   that any new RAs that are seen are not acted upon for a certain
   period, e.g. 2 hours.  This might allow time for a misconfiguration
   or accidental RA to be detected and stopped, before hosts use the
   data in the RA.  Of course this would add delays where genuine new
   RAs are required, while new hosts appearing on a network would still
   be vulnerable (or be unable to configure at all).

3.10.  Use Layer 2 Partitioning

   If each system or user on a network is partitioned into a different
   Layer 2 medium, then the impact of rogue RAs can be limited.  In
   broadband networks RFC1483 bridging may be available, for example.



Chown & Venaas             Expires May 7, 2009                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      Rogue IPv6 Router Advertisements       November 2008


   The benefit may be scenario-specific, e.g. whether a given user or
   customer has their own network prefix or whether the provisioning is
   in a shared subnet or link.  It is certainly desirable that any given
   user or customer's system(s) are unable to see RAs that may be
   generated by other users or customers.

   However, such partitioning would certainly increase address space
   consumption significantly if applied in enterprise networks, and in
   many cases hardware costs and software licensing costs to enable
   routing to the edge can be quite significant.

3.11.  Add a Default Gateway Option to DHCPv6

   It may be possible to define a new Default Gateway Option for DHCPv6
   that would allow network administrators to only have hosts use DHCPv6
   for default gateway configuration in managed networks.  While such an
   option could be defined, its ramifications remain unclear, and such a
   fundamental change to the IPv6 model of autoconfiguration would need
   very careful consideration.

   In the absence of RAs, other configuration information would also be
   missing, e.g. on-link prefix information.  Of course, it may be that
   an RA is still required to inform the host to use DHCPv6, and that
   may introduce a Catch-22 unless hosts are configured directly to only
   use DHCPv6.

   An advantage of DHCPv6 is that should an error be introduced, only
   hosts that have refreshed their DHCP information since that time are
   affected, while a multicast rogue RA will most likely affect all
   hosts immediately.  DHCPv6 also allows different answers to be given
   to different hosts.


4.  Scenarios and mitigations

   In this section we summarise the scenarios and mitigations described
   above in a summary matrix.  We consider, for the case of a rogue
   multicast RA, which of the mitigation methods protects against each
   cause:

   What the above summary does not consider is the practicality of
   deploying the measure.  An easy-to-deploy method that buys improved
   resilience to rogue RAs without significant administrative overhead
   is attractive.  On that basis the RA snooping proposal, e.g.  RA
   Guard, has merit, while approaches like manual configuration and
   perhaps SeND may be less appealing.  However RA Guard is not yet
   fully defined or available, while only certain managed switch
   equipment may support the required ACLs.

   Methods that involve changes to IPv6 protocols such as delays in
   processing RAs or a new DHCPv6 option have rather reduced appeal,
   regardless of their merits or complications.


5.  Other related considerations

   There are a number of related issues that have come out of
   discussions on the rogue RA topic, which the authors believe are
   worth capturing in this document.

Internet-Draft      Rogue IPv6 Router Advertisements       November 2008


5.1.  Unicast RAs

   The above discussion was initially held on the assumption that rogue
   multicast RAs were the cause of problems on a shared network subnet.
   However, the specifications for Router Advertisements allow them to
   be sent unicast to a host, as per Section 6.2.6 of RFC4861.  It is
   thus possible for an attacker to target one or more hosts on a shared
   medium without (potentially) a rogue multicast RA being observed
   elsewhere on the network (e.g. by a monitoring daemon).

5.2.  The DHCP vs RA threat model

   Comparing the threat model for rogue RAs and rogue DHCPv6 servers is
   an interesting exercise.  In the case of Windows ICS causing rogue
   6to4-based RAs to appear on a network, it is very likely that the
   same host is also acting as a rogue IPv4 DHCP server.  The rogue
   DHCPv4 server can allocate a default gateway and an address to hosts,
   just as a rogue RA can lead hosts to learning of a new (additional)
   default gateway and address.  In the case of multicast rogue RAs
   however, the impact is potentially immediate to all hosts, while the
   rogue DHCP server's impact will depend on lease timers for hosts.

   In principle Authenticated DHCP can be used to protect against rogue
   DHCPv4 servers, just as SeND could be used to protect against rogue
   IPv6 RAs.  However use of Authenticated DHCP is currently minimal,
   while SeND is in its infancy in implementation status.

   Were a new DHCPv6 default gateway option to be defined as described
   above, then without Authenticated DHCP the (lack of) security is just
   pushed to another place, albeit one that site administrators are more
   familiar and (rightly or wrongly) comfortable with.

   The RA Guard approach is essentially using a similar model to DHCP
   message snooping to protect against rogue RAs in network (switch)
   equipment.  It is worth noting that DHCPv6 message snooping would
   also be very desirable in IPv6 networks.

5.3.  IPv4-only networks

   The rogue RA problem should also be considered by administrators and
   operators of IPv4-only networks, where IPv6 monitoring, firewalling
   and other related mechanisms may not be in place.

   For example a comment has been made that in the case of 6to4 being
   run by a host on a subnet that is not administratively configured
   with IPv6, some OSes or applications may begin using IPv6 to the 6to4
   host (router) rather than IPv4 to the intended default IPv4 router,
   because they have IPv6 enabled by default and some applications

Internet-Draft      Rogue IPv6 Router Advertisements       November 2008


   prefer IPv6 by default.  Technically aware users may also
   deliberately choose to use IPv6, possibly for subversive reasons.
   Mitigating against this condition can also be seen to be important.

5.4.  Network monitoring tools

   It would generally be prudent for network monitoring or management
   platforms to be able to observe and report on observed RAs, and
   whether unintended RAs (possibly from unintended sources) are present
   on a network.  Further, it may be useful for individual hosts to be
   able to report their address status (assuming their configuration
   status allowed it of course), e.g. this could be useful during an
   IPv6 renumbering phased process as described in RFC4192 [6].

5.5.  Recovering from bad configuration state

   An important issue is how readily a host can recover from bad
   configuration information, e.g. considering the '2 hour rule' of
   Section 5.5.3 of RFC4862 (though this applies to the prefix lifetime
   not the router lifetime).  We should ensure that methods exist for a
   network administrator to correct bad configuration information on a
   link or subnet, and that OS platforms support these methods.  At
   least if the problem can be detected, and corrected promptly, the
   impact is minimised.

5.6.  Behaviour of a node after receiving a rogue RA

   After a host receives and processes a rogue RA, it may have multiple
   default gateways, global addresses, and potentially clashing RA
   options (e.g.  M/O bits).  The host's behaviour may then be
   unpredictable, in terms of the default router that is used, and the
   (source) address(es) used in communications.  A host that is aware of
   protocols such as shim6 may believe it is genuinely multihomed.


6.  Conclusions

   In this text we have described scenarios via which rogue Router
   Advertisements (RAs) may appear on a network, and some measures that
   could be used to mitigate against these.  We have also noted some
   related issues that have arisen in the rogue RA discussions.

   While SeND perhaps offers the most robust solution, implementations
   are not widely available, and the solution is perceived as complex
   (parallels can possibly be drawn with Authenticated DHCP in terms of
   likely deployment).  Adding a new DHCPv6 Default Gateway Option would
   allow configuration by DHCP, and be a method that IPv4 administrators
   are comfortable with (for better or worse), but such an option would

Internet-Draft      Rogue IPv6 Router Advertisements       November 2008


   have significant impacts elsewhere, and in any event one must
   recognise that the security risk is then simply shifted elsewhere.

   Further work on the solutions is certainly welcome.  In the meantime,
   the simplest initial step would be for RA snooping to be defined and
   deployed for Layer 2 devices, in such a way that can address (shared)
   wireless as well as wired networks.  One draft proposal in this
   space, RA-Guard, has recently been published [9].  Alternatively,
   certain switch platforms allow configuration of Access Control Lists
   (ACLs) that can achieve a similar function.

   In the longer term wider experience of SeND will be beneficial, while
   the use of RA snooping (and DHCPv6 snooping) will remain useful
   either to complement SeND or to assist in scenarios that do not lend
   themselves to SeND deployment.
