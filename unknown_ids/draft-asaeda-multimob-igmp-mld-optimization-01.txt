Internet-Draft   IGMP and MLD Optimization for Mobility     October 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) [2] for IPv4 and the
   Multicast Listener Discovery Protocol (MLD) [3] for IPv6 are the
   standard protocols for hosts to initiate joining or leaving multicast
   sessions.  These protocols must be also supported by multicast
   routers or IGMP/MLD proxies [7] that serve multicast member hosts on
   their downstream interfaces.  Conceptually, IGMP and MLD work on
   wireless networks.  However, wireless access technologies operate on
   a shared medium or a point-to-point link with limited frequency and
   bandwidth.  In many wireless regimes, it is desirable to minimize
   multicast-related signaling to preserve the limited resources of
   battery powered mobile devices and the constrained transmission
   capacities of the networks.  A mobile host may cause initiation and
   termination of a multicast service in the new or the previous
   network.  Slow multicast service activation following a join may
   degrade reception quality.  Slow service termination triggered by
   IGMP/MLD querying or by a rapid departure of the mobile host without
   leaving the group in the previous network may waste network
   resources.

   To create the optimal condition for mobile hosts and routers, it is
   required to "ease processing cost or battery power consumption by
   eliminating transmission of a large number of IGMP/MLD messages via
   flooding" and "realize fast state convergence by successive
   monitoring whether downstream members exist or not".

   This document describes the ways of IGMPv3 and MLDv2 protocol
   optimization for mobility.  The optimization includes a query timer
   tuning and an explicit membership notification operation.  The
   selective optimization that provides tangible benefits to the mobile
   hosts and routers is given by "keeping track of downstream hosts'
   membership status", "varying IGMP/MLD Query types and values to tune
   the number of responses", and "using a source filtering mechanism in
   a lightweight manner".  Aside from a modified protocol semantic,
   optional "Notification function" for the IGMPv3 and MLDv2 protocols
   is introduced.  The proposed optimization interoperates with the
   IGMPv3 and MLDv2 protocols.

3.  Optimization

3.1.  Tracking of Membership Status

   Mobile hosts use IGMP and MLD to request to join or leave multicast
   sessions.  When the adjacent upstream routers receive the IGMP/MLD
   Report messages, they recognize the membership status on the link.
   To update the membership status, the routers send IGMP/MLD Query
   messages periodically as a soft-state approach does, and the member
   hosts reply IGMP/MLD Report messages upon reception.

   IGMP/MLD Query is therefore necessary to obtain the up-to-date
   membership information, but a large number of the reply messages sent
   from all member hosts may cause network congestion or consume network
   bandwidth.  To escape from the trouble, a membership report
   suppression mechanism was proposed in the traditional IGMP and MLD
   [4][5][6].  By the report suppression mechanism, a host cancels
   sending a pending membership report requested by IGMP/MLD Query if it
   observes the report that includes the same membership information on
   the network.  However, the report suppression mechanism precluded the
   function for an upstream router to track membership status.  In
   IGMPv3 [2] and MLDv2 [3], hence the membership report suppression
   mechanism has been removed, and all downstream member hosts must send
   their membership reports to an upstream router.

   The "explicit tracking function" is the possible approach to create
   the optimal condition for mobile communications.  This enables the
   router to keep track of the membership status of the downstream
   IGMPv3 or MLDv2 member hosts.

   The explicit tracking function reduces the number of solicited
   membership reports by periodical IGMP/MLD Query, and finally the
   total number of transmitted IGMP/MLD messages can be drastically
   reduced.  This is beneficial especially to mobile hosts that do not
   have enough battery power, since flooding IGMP/MLD messages on a
   wireless link makes all multicast members give significant attention
   and induces power consumption to the member hosts.  This also allows
   the upstream router to proceed fast leaves, because the router can
   immediately converge and update the membership information, ideally.

   On the other hand, routers still need to maintain downstream
   membership status by sending IGMPv3/MLDv2 query messages due to the
   following reasons.

   o  IGMP/MLD messages are non-reliable and may be lost in the
      transmission, therefore routers need to confirm the membership by
      sending query messages.

Internet-Draft   IGMP and MLD Optimization for Mobility     October 2009


   o  Routers need additional processing capability and a possibly large
      memory to keep track of membership status, and therefore the
      routers usually disable the function for keeping track of
      membership status.

   o  To preserve compatibility with older versions of IGMP/MLD, routers
      need to support downstream hosts that are not upgraded to the
      latest versions of IGMP/MLD and run the report suppression
      mechanism.

   o  It is impossible to identify mobile hosts when hosts have the same
      IPv6 link-local address in some mobile routing environment such as
      PMIPv6 [11].

   This document recommends to enable the explicit tracking function at
   multicast routers if their resources are enough to handle downstream
   membership information and all hosts membership report messages do
   not affect wireless communications.  While this document defines the
   new [Multicast Query Interval] value (described in Section 6), the
   standard [Query Interval] value and [Multicast Query Interval] value
   can be tuned to be longer when the explicit tracking function is
   enabled at adjacent upstream multicast routers.

3.2.  IGMP/MLD Query Processing

   IGMP and MLD are non-reliable protocols; to cover the possibility of
   a State-Change Report being missed by one or more multicast routers,
   a host retransmits the same State-Change Report [Robustness Variable]
   - 1 more times, at intervals chosen at random from the range (0,
   [Unsolicited Report Interval]) [2][3].  However, this manner does not
   guarantee that the State-Change Report is reached to the routers.
   The routers therefore need to refresh the downstream membership
   information by receiving Current-State Report periodically solicited
   by IGMP/MLD General Query, in order to be robust in front of host or
   link failures and packet loss.  It supports the situation that mobile
   hosts turn off or move from the wireless network to other wireless
   network managed by the different router without any notification
   (e.g., leave request).

   A multicast router periodically transmits IGMP/MLD General Query in
   the [Query Interval] sec.  In general, the all-hosts multicast
   address (224.0.0.1) or link-scope all-nodes multicast address
   (FF02::1) is used as the IP destination address of IGMP/MLD General
   Query.  Unfortunately, flooding periodical message whose destination
   address is the all-hosts/all-nodes multicast address consumes bettery
   power of mobile hosts.  Only the active hosts that have been
   receiving multicast contents should respond the Query message.

Internet-Draft   IGMP and MLD Optimization for Mobility     October 2009


   IGMPv3 and MLDv2 specifications [2][3] mention that a host MUST
   accept and process any Query whose IP Destination Address field
   contains any of the addresses (unicast or multicast) assigned to the
   interface on which the Query arrives.  According to the scenario, a
   router can unicast the message to tracked member hosts in the [Query
   Interval], if the router keeps track of membership information
   (Section 3.1).  Unicasting IGMP/MLD General Query is effective
   especially when a small number of mobile hosts attaches to a network.

   If a multicast router attached on a wireless link enables an explicit
   tracking function and unicasts IGMP/MLD General Query for each member
   host, the router may configure longer [Multicast Query Interval]
   value, which is newly defined in this document and described in
   Section 6, in order to reduce the number of IGMP/MLD General Query
   messages via multicast.

   If either a multicast router does not track the member hosts or a
   large number of mobile hosts attaches the network, the router
   multicasts IGMP/MLD General Query with shorter [Multicast Query
   Interval].

   Note that it is necessary to multicast IGMP/MLD General Query even if
   a router keeps track of member hosts, in order to be robust from lost
   IGMP/MLD messages sent from downstream hosts.  In addition, longer
   query interval will increase join latency when an unsolicited Join
   message with State-Change Record requesting joining a multicast
   session is not reached to the router, or it will increase leave
   latency when an unsolicited Leave message with State-Change Record
   requesting leaving a session is not reached to the router.

   IGMP/MLD Group-Specific and Group-and-Source Specific Queries defined
   in [2][3] are sent to verify whether there are hosts that desire
   reception of the specified group or a set of sources or to rebuild
   the desired reception state for a particular group or a set of
   sources.

   These specific Queries build and refresh multicast membership state
   of hosts on an attached network.  These specific Queries should be
   sent to each corresponding multicast address (not the all-hosts/
   all-nodes multicast address) as their IP destination addresses,
   because hosts that do not join the multicast session do not pay
   attention these specific Queries, and only active member hosts that
   have been receiving multicast contents with the specified address
   reply IGMP/MLD reports.

3.3.  IGMP/MLD Report Processing

   An IGMPv3 Report is sent with a valid IP source address, and an MLDv2
   Report MUST be sent with a valid IPv6 link-local source address.

   Note that the IGMPv3 specification [2] permits that a host uses the
   0.0.0.0 source address, as it happens that the host has not yet
   acquired an IP address, and routers MUST accept a report with a
   source address of 0.0.0.0.  On the other hand, the MLDv2
   specification [3] describes that an MLDv2 Report can be sent with the
   unspecified address (::), if the sending interface has not acquired a
   valid link-local address yet.  However, routers MUST silently discard
   a message that is not sent with a valid link-local address, without
   taking any action.  Thus, an MLDv2 Report sent with the unspecified
   address is also discarded by the router, because of the security
   consideration.

   In summary, routers permit that multiple mobile hosts simultaneously
   use the same IPv4 address, including the 0.0.0.0 source address, for
   an IGMPv3 Report, or simultaneously use the same IPv6 link-local
   address, but not the unspecified address, for an MLDv2 Report.  When
   routers receive IGMPv3/MLDv2 Reports with duplicate source addresses
   or the 0.0.0.0 or the unspecified address, they should disable the
   explicit tracking function (described in Section 3.1) even if it has
   been enabled.

3.4.  Multicast Source Filter

   IGMPv3 and MLDv2 provide the ability for hosts to report source-
   specific subscriptions.  With IGMPv3/MLDv2, a mobile host can specify
   a channel of interest, using multicast group and source addresses
   with INCLUDE filter mode in its join request.  Upon reception, the
   upstream router establishes the shortest path tree toward the source
   without coordinating a shared tree.  This function is called the
   source filtering function and required to support Source-Specific
   Multicast (SSM) [8].

   IGMPv3 and MLDv2 support another operation with EXCLUDE filter mode.
   When a mobile host specifies multicast and source addresses with
   EXCLUDE filter mode in the join request, an upstream router forwards
   the multicast packets sent from all sources *except* the specified
   sources.

   However, practical applications do not use EXCLUDE mode to block
   sources very often, because a user or application usually wants to
   specify desired source addresses, not undesired source addresses.  In
   addition, this scheme leads an implementation cost to mobile hosts
   and complex procedures to maintain coexisting situation of the



Asaeda                   Expires April 29, 2010                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft   IGMP and MLD Optimization for Mobility     October 2009


   interesting source address lists with INCLUDE filter mode or non-
   interesting source address lists with EXCLUDE filter mode.

   Furthermore, specifying non-interesting source addresses with EXCLUDE
   filter mode reduces the advantage of scalable routing tree
   coordination produced by SSM.  An upstream router needs to maintain a
   shared tree (e.g., RPT in PIM-SM [10]) whenever the router receives
   join request with EXCLUDE filter mode from the downstream hosts.
   This increases the tree maintenance cost to the multicast routers on
   the routing paths.  While the mobile multicast communication does not
   prohibit a traditional (*,G) join request (which is a join request
   with EXCLUDE filter mode without specifying any source address), all
   other join requests with EXCLUDE filter mode should be eliminated
   from the mobile multicast communication.

   Recently, Lightweight-IGMPv3 (LW-IGMPv3) and Lightweight-MLDv2 (LW-
   MLDv2) [9] are proposed in the IETF MBONED working group.  These
   protocols are the simplified versions of IGMPv3 and MLDv2, and
   eliminate an EXCLUDE filter mode operation.  Not only are LW-IGMPv3
   and LW-MLDv2 fully compatible with the full version of these
   protocols (i.e., the standard IGMPv3 and MLDv2), but also the
   protocol operations made by hosts and routers are simplified in the
   lightweight manner, and complicated operations are effectively
   reduced.  LW-IGMPv3 and LW-MLDv2 give the opportunity to grow SSM
   use.

   In the lightweight protocols, EXCLUDE mode on the host part is
   preserved only for EXCLUDE (*,G) join/leave, which denotes a non-
   source-specific group report (known as the traditional (*,G) join/
   leave or Any-Source Multicast (ASM)) and is equivalent to the group
   membership join/leave triggered by IGMPv2/IGMPv1/MLDv1.  This
   document hence recommends to adopt LW-IGMPv3 and LW-MLDv2 to mobile
   hosts and routers and eliminate EXCLUDE filter mode operation from
   mobile hosts.

4.  Explicit Membership Notification

   This document proposes an IGMP/MLD Notification operation, in which a
   mobile host *periodically* sends Current-State Record messages
   expressing which multicast sessions the host is joining, even the
   host is not requested to report the membership information by its
   upstream router (i.e., no reception of General Query message).

   The IGMP/MLD Notification operation enables the longer [Multicast
   Query Interval] value for IGMP/MLD General Query than the default
   [Query Interval].  If mobile hosts support the IGMP/MLD Notification
   operation, a multicast router can obtain downstream membership
   information without periodical and spontaneous membership
   solicitation by IGMP/MLD General Query.  The router only needs to
   refresh downstream membership information by solicited IGMP/MLD
   General Query to the hosts that do not support the IGMP/MLD
   Notification operation or leave from network without sending any
   message to the router.

   If timers are tuned by dynamic nature of membership, the IGMP/MLD
   Notification operation reduces the number of IGMP/MLD General Query
   periodically sent by a router and the total number of IGMP/MLD
   messages.  Since a router only needs to refresh downstream membership
   information by solicited General Query to hosts that do not support
   the Notification operation, both [Unicast Query Interval] and
   [Multicast Query Interval] can be set to longer values.  This
   mechanism may conserve battery power of sleeping hosts, as these
   hosts do not pay attention to the General Query messages at short
   intervals.

   The IGMP/MLD Notification operation also contributes to fast
   handover, because a host receiving data immediately sends unsolicited
   reports without waiting for IGMP/MLD General Query at the new
   network.

   The [Notification Interval] value (described in Section 6) is the
   interval of Current-State Records periodically sent by a member host
   that joins at least one multicast session.  Since a mobile host
   periodically unicasts Current-State Record in [Notification Interval]
   that is shorter than the regular General Query interval (i.e.  [Query
   Interval] value) and [Multicast Query Interval] and [Unicast Query
   Interval], even if a router tracking membership status misses State-
   Change Report that requests a leave operation, the router can operate
   a leave procedure faster than the regular case.  When mobile hosts
   receive IGMP/MLD General Query, they reset their [Notification
   Interval] timer value and restart it.

   When a multicast router works with the Notification operation, it

   must maintain the following information for each multicast session to
   recognize receiver host's membership status;

   1      Receiver address - indicates an address of a receiver host
          sending the Current-State Report.

   2      Last membership report - indicates the time that the router
          receives the last Current-State Report.

   3      Filter mode - indicates either INCLUDE or EXCLUDE as defined
          in [2][3].

   4      Source addresses and multicast address - indicates the address
          pair that the receiver joins.

5.  Interoperability

   This document assumes multicast routers that deal with mobile hosts
   MUST be IGMPv3/MLDv2 capable (regardless whether the protocols are
   the full or lightweight version).  Therefore all interoperability
   conditions are inherited from [2][3][9], and this document does not
   need to consider interoperability with older version protocols.

   An IGMP/MLD Notification operation is a simple optimization for
   mobile hosts to spontaneously send IGMP/MLD Current-State Report to
   their upstream multicast routers.  Since a multicast router solicits
   downstream membership information by IGMP/MLD General Query, non-
   upgraded mobile hosts can coexist in the network.  However, join and
   leave latency for non-upgraded mobile hosts may become longer due to
   the longer [Query Interval] timer configuration for multicast
   routers.  Note that the IGMP/MLD Notification operation does not
   require any modification to multicast routers.

6.  Timers, Counters, and Their Default Values

   The [Query Interval] is the interval between General Queries sent by
   the regular IGMPv3/MLDv2 querier, and the default value is 125
   seconds [2][3].  By varying the [Query Interval], multicast routers
   can tune the number of IGMP messages on the network; larger values
   cause IGMP Queries to be sent less often.

   The Querier's Query Interval Code (QQIC) field specifies the [Query
   Interval] in the IGMP/MLD query message, and will be tuned by the
   querier.  The actual interval, called the Querier's Query Interval
   (QQI), is derived from QQIC.  Multicast routers that are not the
   current querier adopt the QQI value from the most recently received
   Query as their own [Query Interval] value.  The [Multicast Query
   Interval] value is calculated from the [Query Interval] value

   [TODO: We will provide the appropriate [Query Interval] and
   [Multicast Query Interval] values that would fit in the mobile
   communication environment based on some experimental results.
   Tentatively, this document currently defines the default [Query
   Interval] value is 90 sec. and the default [Multicast Query Interval]
   value is 180 sec.]

   The [Query Response Interval] is the Max Response Time (or Max
   Response Delay) used to calculate the Max Resp Code inserted into the
   periodic General Queries, and the default value is 10 seconds [2][3].
   By varying the [Query Response Interval], multicast routers can tune
   the burstiness of IGMP/MLD messages on the network; larger values
   make the traffic less bursty, as host responses are spread out over a
   larger interval.

   [TODO: We will provide the appropriate [Query Response Interval]
   value that would fit in the mobile communication environment based on
   some experimental results.]

   To cover the possibility of unsolicited reports being missed by
   multicast routers, unsolicited reports are retransmitted [Robustness
   Variable] - 1 more times, at intervals chosen at random from the
   defined range [2][3].  The QRV (Querier's Robustness Variable) field
   in IGMP/MLD Query contains the [Robustness Variable] value used by
   the querier.  Routers adopt the QRV value from the most recently
   received Query as their own [Robustness Variable] value, whose range
   SHOULD be set between "1" to "7".  While the default [Robustness
   Variable] value defined in IGMPv3 [2] and MLDv2 [3] is "2", the
   [Robustness Variable] value announced by the querier MUST NOT be "0"

   The default [Notification Interval] value is 60 sec.  The
   [Notification Interval] value MUST be shorter than both [Query
   Interval] and [Multicast Query Interval] values.
