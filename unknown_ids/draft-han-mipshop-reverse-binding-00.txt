Internet-Draft         Reverse Binding for PMIPv6          February 2009


1.  Introduction

   The PMIPv6 (Proxy Mobile IPv6) [RFC5213] protocol provides local
   mobility management to a mobile node without requiring any
   modification of the mobile node.  But, PMIPv6's handover could cause
   undesirable delay to the mobile nodes running real time applications
   like VoIP.  This memo proposes a scheme that supports a fast handover
   effectively in PMIPv6 by optimizing the associated data and signaling
   flows during the handover.

   FMIPv6 (Fast Handover for Mobile IPv6) [RFC5268] is a well-known fast
   handover scheme for the host-based Mobile IPv6.  It may be harnessed
   to enhance PMIPv6's handover performance.  Actually, a scheme has
   been proposed based on the FMIPv6's strategy (see
   [I-D.draft-ietf-mipshop-pfmipv6]).  However, they induce unnecessary
   processing overhead for re-tunneling at the MAGs, as well as
   inefficient usage of network bandwidth if there are no direct secure
   links between them.  The main reason for this is that the data
   transport of PMIPv6 is based on the tunneling from the LMA to the
   MAG, not between MAGs, while the FMIPv6 and the existing scheme
   [I-D.draft-ietf-mipshop-pfmipv6] use the tunneling between the
   previous MAG and new MAG to forward the data in transit during
   handover.

   We propose a new PMIPv6's fast handover scheme to overcome such
   ineffectiveness by defining the signaling messages, Fast PBU/PBA and
   Reverse PBU/PBA, exchanged between LAM and MAGs.  The proposed scheme
   utilizes only pre-established bi-directional tunnels between LMA and
   MAGs.  Because any signaling messages exchanged by two MAGs are
   neither created nor utilized and thus bi-directional tunnel between
   MAGs is not created, the proposed scheme put less overload upon
   network than the existing fast handover scheme for PMIPv6.  It can
   also tackle effectively with the so-called ping-pong movement of
   mobile nodes.

   During handover procedure, the FMIPv6 and the existing scheme
   [I-D.draft-ietf-mipshop-pfmipv6] compell a mobile node's uplink
   traffic to be tunnelled to the previous MAG, and then to the LMA.
   This zigzag path of data traffic can produce poor throughput.
   Besides, as [I-D.draft-ietf-mipshop-transient-bce-pmipv6-01]
   mentioned, currently and as per PMIPv6 base protocol [RFC5268], the
   LMA forwards a mobile node's uplink traffic received from a tunnel
   only as long as the source IP address of the node's uplink traffic
   matches the IP address of the node's registered Proxy-CoA in the
   associated binding cache entry.  As a result, packets received at the
   LMA from the node's previous MAG after the LMA has already switched
   the tunnel to point to the new MAG will be dropped.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
   [RFC5213], in addition to the ones specified in this section:

   o  Previous Mobile Access Gateway (PMAG): The MAG that manages
      mobility related signaling for the MN before handover.

   o  New Mobile Access Gateway (NMAG): The MAG that manages mobility
      related signaling for the MN after handover.

   o  Previous Point of Attachment (P-PoA): The access network device to
      which the MN is attached before handover.

   o  New Point of Attachment (N-PoA): The access network device to
      which the MN is attached after handover.

   o  Fast Proxy Binding Update (Fast PBU): A request message sent by an
      MAG to a mobile node's LMA for expediting the handover procedure.

   o  Fast Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (Fast PBA): A reply message
      sent by the LMA in response to a Fast PBU message that it received
      from a MAG.

   o  Reverse Proxy Binding Update (Reverse PBU): A request message sent
      by the LMA to a mobile node's new MAG after establishing a binding
      between the home network prefix assigned to the mobile node and
      its new care-of address (Proxy-CoA).

   o  Reverse Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (Reverse PBA): A reply
      message sent by an MAG in response to a Reverse PBU message that
      it received from the LMA.


3.  Protocol Operation

   Because a mobile node is not directly involved with IPv6 mobility
   management, it is also unaware of fast handover procedure defined in
   this memo.  All new signaling messages defined in this memo are
   exchanged by MAGs and the LMA.  The proposed scheme is not based on
   the fast handover strategy defined in [RFC5268].

   To reduce the handover latency due to signaling between the MAGs and
   the LMA, this memo only utilizes the bi-directional tunnels between

   the LMA and the PMAG/NMAG.  That is, no tunnel creation between MAGs
   is required.  The bi-directional tunnel between the LMA and the PMAG
   has been already established to provide a visited mobile node with
   the packet delivery service.  The bi-directional tunnel between the
   LMA and the NMAG may be also already established because the tunnels
   are shared for multiple mobile nodes in PMIPv6.  If there is no
   tunnel between the LMA and the NMAG, a new one should be created
   during the proposed procedure.

   It is recommended that the bi-directional tunnels between the LMA and
   all MAGs should be statically pre-established to make the proposed
   scheme operate efficiently.

                                 Figure 1

   The procedure is as follows (see Figure 1):

   (a)     A handover is imminent and a link-specific pre-handover
           procedure is performed.  The pre-handover procedure can be
           host-initiated or network-initiated.  The exact procedure is
           out of scope.

   (b)     P-PoA, to which the MN is currently attached, indicates the
           handover of the mobile node to the PMAG.  The exact procedure
           of this indication is also out of scope.

   (c)     The PMAG sends the Fast PBU to the LMA.  The Fast PBU message
           MUST include the MN ID and the new PCoA, the address of NMAG,
           which is resolved by the New AP ID.

   (d)     The LMA sends back the Fast PBA to the PMAG.

   (e)     The LMA establishes a binding between the home network prefix
           (HNP) assigned to the mobile node and its new PCoA.  The LMA
           sends the Reverse PBU to the NMAG.  The Reverse PBU message
           MUST include the MN ID and the HNP of the mobile node.

   (f)     The NMAG sends back the Reverse PBA to the LMA.

   (g)     If the bi-directional tunnel is not established between the
           NMAG and the LMA, a new tunnel is established.  The LMA
           starts to transfer packets destined for the mobile node via
           the NMAG.  If the mobile node has not established a
           connection with NMAG at this time, the NMAG starts to buffer
           the packets.

   (h)     The mobile node hands over to the New Access Network.

   (i)     The mobile node establishes a connection (e.g. radio channel)
           with the N-PoA, which in turn triggers the establishment of
           the connection between the N-PoA and NMAG.  The exact
           procedure of this procedure is also out of scope.

   (j)     The NMAG starts to transfer packets destined for the mobile
           node via the N-PoA.

   (k)     The uplink packets from the mobile node are sent to the NMAG
           via the N-PoA and the NMAG forwards them to the LMA.

   As the name implies, the reverse PBU message is sent by the LMA and
   the recipient of it is the NMAG.  Upon receiving it, the NMAG creates

   a new binding cache entry and establishes a new bi-directional tunnel
   if it does not exist.  After doing them, the NMAG replies to the LMA
   by sending the reverse PBA message.

   It is also noted that the Reverse PBU and PBA are the alternates of
   the original PBU and PBU of PMIPv6.  That is, the proposed scheme
   incorporates the main part of PMIPv6 procedure in the fast handover
   procedure, and thus any subsequent PMIPv6 procedure may be not
   necessary.
