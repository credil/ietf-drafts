Abstract

   This Internet Draft describes an enhanced way to exchange prefix
   information, to permit multiple copies of a prefix with different
   paths to be announced and withdrawn.

   This negotiated capability provides faster local (inter-AS) and
   global (intra-AS) convergence, reduces path-hunting, improves route-
   reflector behaviour, including eliminating both persistent
   oscillations and BGP "wedgies".

   Additional prefix instances have new optional transtive BGP
   attributes, to control path selection.

   Withdrawl of prefixes will require path attributes.

   Benefits are seen both when deployed intra-AS, and on inter-AS
   peering.

1.  Background

   Even when all the best current practises are observed, operational
   problems may be experienced when running a BGP network.

   These include slow convergence due to path-hunting, persistant
   oscillations [1], and BGP "wedgies" [2].

   Standardization of MRAI timers helps this, as well as RFC 5004 [4].

   These RFCs identify the above issues as needing further work.

1.1.  Localized Information

   The problems listed above occur as a result of additional information
   not being available (either on a transient basis, or permanently.)

   In the case of "path hunting", the information needed for achieving a
   stable final state is eventually received, but until it is, sub-
   optimal forwarding will occur, and possibly even transient routing
   loops.

   The "problem" mechanisms involved are:

   o  the suppression of announcement of "second-best" paths, because of
      IBGP-received "best" paths;

   o  the suppression by route-reflectors, of IBGP non-best paths (i.e.
      those normally seen directly by IBGP peers)

   o  the suppression of announcement of "second-best" paths, because of
      EBGP-received "best" paths.

   o  the lack of explicit global mechanism for expressing de-prefering
      announcements via "back-up" providers.

   When a prefix+path received is better than the local "best", the new
   "best" is normally sent.

   However, once a new "best" is received, the side-effect is to force
   the speaker to WITHDRAW the previous best path within the same
   "regime" (IBGP mesh or EBGP peers).

   When we consider the extra (e.g. suppressed) information, with
   special rules on what to send and how to treat it, the specified
   problems may go away, or be reduced in scope, duration, or
   likelihood.

1.2.  The Withdrawl Problem

   When a prefix (plus path) is withdrawn, the desired stable state is
   for the next-best path for that prefix (if one exists) to be chosen
   at each BGP speaker per its local policy.

   If that second-best path is already on hand, the delay and
   intermediate states can be reduced or entirely avoided.  This is
   especially true for both intra-AS and inter-AS "path hunting".

   To avoid inconsistent behavior, routing loops, and routing-
   information loops, the second-best path received from a neighbor,
   should never be selected as a best path locally.

   The second-best path from a neighbor MUST ONLY be considered as a
   candidate for best path, when the previous best path from that
   neighbor is withdrawn.  When this occurs, the path in question is
   promoted to "best" status.

1.3.  The Uniqueness Problem

   Currently, for each prefix, only one path for that prefix is ever
   announced from one peer to another (except in the instance of Route
   Reflectors).  Because of this property, uniqueness, a withdrawl on a
   prefix does not require path information.  This also means that a
   change of best path is accomplished via an update for a prefix with
   the new path information.

   If, however, more than one path for a given prefix was sent, then any
   attempt to withdraw a prefix+path would require that the specific
   path for the prefix being withdrawn be supplied in the withdrawl
   update message.

   In an environment where multiple paths per prefix are possible, but
   only one path per prefix is maintained, then two steps would be
   involved in changing the "best" path.  In no particular order, that
   would be the withdrawl of the old prefix+path, and the announcement
   of the new prefix+path.

2.  Proposed Changes

2.1.  New Negotiated Option: USE_SECOND_BEST

   This is a new BGP Capabilities value, which can be optionally
   included in the capabilities negotiation.  The specific value is a
   code-point to be assigned by IANA.

2.2.  New Optional Path Attribute: SECOND_BEST

   This is a new BGP Path Attribute type.  It may only be used if the
   USE_SECOND_BEST capability has been negotiated.  It will generally be
   required for up to half of the Update messages sent to a peer with
   whom USE_SECOND_BEST has been negotiated.  The type value is a new
   code point to be assigned by IANA.

   This is an Optional, Non-Transitive, Non-Extended, Non-Partial
   attribute.  All the "attr flag bits" (from BGP [3]) are zero.  The
   length is 1, and the value is 1.

2.3.  New Negotiated Option: USE_BACKUP_ONLY

   This is a new BGP Capabilities value, which can be optionally
   included in the capabilities negotiation.  The specific value is a
   code-point to be assigned by IANA.

2.4.  New Optional Path Attribute: BACKUP_ONLY

   This is a new BGP Path Attribute type.  The type value is a new code
   point to be assigned by IANA.  This is an Optional, Transitive, Non-
   Extended, Non-Partial attribute, with the "attr flag bits" (from BGP
   [3]) set to appropriate values.  The length is 1, and the value is 1.

2.5.  New Update Format

   Update messages are identical to existing format, with the exception
   of the new optional Path Attributes, SECOND_BEST and/or BACKUP_ONLY.
   If BGP capability USE_SECOND_BEST has been negotiated, any Update MAY
   have a Path Attribute which include SECOND_BEST.  Likewise, if the
   BGP capability USE_BACKUP_ONLY has been negotiated, any Update MAY
   have a Path Attribute which includes BACKUP_ONLY.  More than one
   instance of a given prefix, with distinct values of Path Attributes,
   MAY be sent between BGP speakers.

   At most four instances may be sent, specifically one of each
   combination of with/without SECOND_BEST and BACKUP_ONLY: One with
   neither, one with SECOND_BEST only, one with just BACKUP_ONLY, and
   one with both SECOND_BEST and BACKUP_ONLY.

Internet-Draft         BGP Second-Best and Back-up         February 2008


   Two prefix paths are considered identical if they differ only in the
   presence or absence of either of the new attributes (SECOND_BEST
   and/or BACKUP_ONLY).  An Update which contains a path which differs
   by either or both of these, will result in the path information for
   the prefix being modified.

2.6.  New Withdraw Format

   Since it is no longer possible to identify which instance of an
   prefix is affected by an update containing a withdrawl, all
   withdrawls SHOULD contain path information.  Where a withdrawl would
   not be ambiguous, implementations MAY send withdrawls without path
   information.  Where a withdrawl is not amibiguous, implementations
   MUST send path information with any withdrawl.  Withdrawl Update
   messages do not require either SECOND_BEST or BACKUP_ONLY attributes,
   and if either is present, it MUST be ignored.

3.  Modifications to BGP Behavior

3.1.  Changes to Path Selection Rules

   The path selection rules for BGP (section 9.1.2.2 of BGP4 [3]) are
   changed as follows:

   o  The following rule is placed before step (a): If paths with and
      without BACKUP_ONLY are both available, those with BACKUP_ONLY are
      eliminated

   o  The following rule is a modification to step (c): Step (c) is
      first performed INCLUDING paths with SECOND_BEST.  If, at the end
      of the first attempt at step (c), only paths with SECOND_BEST
      remain, re-run step (c), this time EXCLUDING the paths with
      SECOND_BEST.  After this modified version of step (c), the
      remaining paths MUST NOT have the SECOND_BEST attribute.  In other
      words, Step (c) MUST remove any SECOND_BEST paths.

   o  The remainder of the usual BGP path selection rules are applied as
      normal

   o  If the final path selected has the BACKUP_ONLY attribute, that
      attribute is preserved.

   The path selection rules for "Second Best" path are as follows:

   o  The already-selected "best" path is removed from the set of paths
      to compare

   o  The same rules are applied as for the "best" path

   o  The selected path is advertised with the attribute SECOND_BEST
      applied

   o  If the selected path had the BACKUP_ONLY attribute, that attribute
      is preserved

   The prefix instances for consideration of second-best path are the
   REMAINDER of non-SECOND_BEST instances, and the SECOND_BEST instance
   received on the in-RIB from which the best path was selected (if one
   exists).  Only one SECOND_BEST instance received may be considered
   for the local (and out-RIB) SECOND_BEST path.

3.2.  Second Best - Basic Method

   Once the capabality for doing so has been negotiated between a pair
   of BGP speakers, each sends the best two paths for each prefix.  The



Dickson                  Expires August 8, 2008                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         BGP Second-Best and Back-up         February 2008


   path information will include the additional SECOND_BEST attribute on
   the second best path.

   When the current "best" path is withdrawn, the withdrawl MAY be
   propogated without having to perform a full BGP table path selection.
   The current "second best" path in the local-RIB is promoted to
   "best".  This is because the alternate candidates have already been
   evaluated and "second-best" has already been selected.

   Whenever an AS consists of a mesh of BGP speakers who have negotiated
   this capability, the withdrawl will propogate through the entire AS.
   This will either have no effect, or with a change in "best" without
   requiring non-local information to choose the new "best" path.

3.3.  Second Best - Route Reflector

   The "best" and "second best" are reflected.  The same mechanism is
   used for determining both best and second-best per prefix.  Updates
   must be reflected whenever the choice of either or both of the "best"
   or "second best" change.  Withdrawls may be propogated immediately.

3.4.  Second Best - Inter-AS Hybrid Method

   When a withdrawl of the current best path is received from a peer
   doing USE_SECOND_BEST, and the rules for sending updates require that
   an update for this prefix be sent to a peer who does not support
   USE_SECOND BEST, the current second-best instance of the prefix is
   sent to that peer in an Update.  The neighbor does not need the
   withdraw, since the new path replaces the old path.

3.5.  Backup Only - Basic Method

   The main reason for establishing the BACKUP_ONLY attribute is to
   permit the global implementation of actual "backup only"
   announcements.  It is not to facilitate change of policies, or to
   circumvent local policies, instead it is to make possible the
   implementation of policies where those have been negotiated by two or
   more parties.

   Currently, there are several documented scenarios in the "Wedgies"
   RFC [2] where the mutually desired policy is either unable to be
   implemented, or does not deterministically reach the desired state.

   Use of the BACKUP_ONLY attribute on announcements sent to a backup
   provider, permit these problems to be resolved.

   The same prefix is announced to both the primary and backup provider.
   When announced to the primary provider, the BACKUP_ONLY attribute is

Internet-Draft         BGP Second-Best and Back-up         February 2008


   NOT set.  When announced to the backup provider, the BACKUP_ONLY
   attribute IS set.

   The propogation of the BACKUP_ONLY instance will be limited by the
   availability of multiple paths and the use of SECOND_BEST peerings.

   In Figure 6 (of Appendix C), the BACKUP_ONLY instance will be seen by
   the backup provider, and be passed with both SECOND_BEST and
   BACKUP_ONLY to the backup provider's transit provider.  The latter
   will prefer any other instace without BACKUP_ONLY, even if it has
   applied a LOCAL_PREFERENCE to the received prefix instance.  Should
   the other instance be withdrawn, the BACKUP_ONLY will be selected and
   subsequently propogated.  The withdrawl will also eventually result
   in an Update with the BACKUP_ONLY attribute but WITHOUT the
   SECOND_BEST attribute (since the prefix will now only be reachable
   via the backup provider.)

3.6.  Backup Only - Route Reflector

   Route Reflectors operate the same as always.  The BACKUP_ONLY
   attribute MUST be preserved during reflection.  Thus, if "Second
   Best" is in operation, then the BACKUP_ONLY attribute of both best
   and second-best MUST be preserved on both instances.  And, if "Second
   Best" is not in use, then the selected "best" prefix, if it has
   BACKUP_ONLY set, must be reflected with BACKUP_ONLY as well.

3.7.  IBGP vs EBGP

   The same rules apply for EBGP->EBGP, EBGP->IBGP, IBGP->EBGP, and
   IBGP->IBGP.  If a particular peering has had USE_SECOND_BEST
   negotiated, then any update for a particular prefix that results in
   new selection of either or both of best and second-best, the new
   selections (and possible withdrawl of old selections) is sent to the
   appropraite peers.  If a particular peering has had USE_BACKUP_ONLY
   negotiated, then updates which have BACKUP_ONLY MAY be sent.

   By including the second_best in the best path calculation, the
   persistent oscillation problem is resolved.

Appendix C.  BGP Wedgie Examples

   The following examples from RFC 4264 [2] show the effects of the
   proposed changes, in resolving "wedgie" issues.

   +----+                +----+
   |AS 3|----------------|AS 4|
   +----+ peer      peer +----+
     |provider             |provider
     |                     |
     |customer             |
   +----+                  |
   |AS 2|                  |
   +----+                  |
     |provider             |
     |                     |
     |customer             |customer
     +-------+  +----------+
       backup|  |primary
            +----+
            |AS 1|
            +----+

                                 Figure 6

   In Figure 6 above, the announcement via the backup link is sent with
   BACKUP_ONLY.

   o  AS 4 sends the "best" (the direct link to AS 1) to AS 3.

   o  AS 2 sends its "best", which is the BACKUP_ONLY path from AS 1, to
      AS 3, also with BACKUP_ONLY (since it is a transitive attribute).

   o  AS 3 and AS 4 exchange their respective "best" paths.

   o  AS 3 prefers the path "4 1" over "2 1" because "2 1" is
      BACKUP_ONLY.

   o  AS 3 sends a revised BACKUP_ONLY update to AS 4 as SECOND_BEST.

   o  AS 3 sends the new "best" to AS 2.

   o  AS 2 sends a revised BACKUP_ONLY update to AS 3 as SECOND_BEST.

   This state will be reached regardless of sequence of disconnects and
   reconnects.

   Link failures will also result in propogation of withdrawls of "best"

   and the SECOND_BEST promotions will result in immediate correct
   behavior.

            +----+

                                 Figure 7

   In Figure 7 above, the announcements via the backup links will work
   the same as in Example 1.

   +----+                +----+
   |AS 3|----------------|AS 4|
   +----+ peer      peer +----+
    ||provider             |providerS
    |+-----------+         |
    |customer    |customer |

   |AS 2|-------|AS 5|     |
   +----+ peer  +----+     |
     |provider   |provider |

       backup| ||primary
            +----+
            |AS 1|
            +----+

                                 Figure 8

   In Figure 8 above, the announcements via both backup links will

   result in:

   o  AS 2 selecting its best path via "3 4 1" (the only path it hears
      from AS 3)

   o  AS 2 hearing two paths from AS 5:

      *  its "second best" path "5 3 4 1"

      *  another path marked SECOND_BEST and BACKUP_ONLY with path "5 1"

   o  AS 2 hearing a BACKUP_ONLY directly from AS 1

   Any announcement that AS 3 hears from AS 2 or AS 5 will always be
   marked BACKUP_ONLY.  Thus, any combination of break/restore on any
   links in any order, will always result in the desired state being
   reached.
