Internet-Draft           Additional Private IPv4          September 2009


1.  Introduction

   [RFC1918] sets aside three blocks of IPv4 address space for use in
   private networks: 192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12 and 10.0.0.0/8.
   These blocks can be used simultaneously in multiple, separately
   managed networks without registration or coordination with IANA or
   any Internet registry.  Very large networks can find that they need
   to connect more interfaces than the number of addresses available in
   these three ranges.  It has occasionally been suggested that
   additional private IPv4 address space should be reserved for use by
   these networks.  Although such an action might address some of the
   needs for these very large network operators it is not without
   consequences, particularly as we near the date when the IANA free
   pool will be fully allocated.


2.  Large Networks

   The main categories of very large networks using private address
   space are: cable operators, wireless (cell phone) operators, private
   internets and VPN service providers.  In the case of the first two
   categories, the complete address space reserved in [RFC1918] tends to
   be used by a single organization.  In the case of private internets
   and VPN service providers there are multiple independently managed
   and operated networks and the difficulty is in avoiding address
   clashes.


3.  Network Address Translation

   The address space set aside in [RFC1918] is a finite resource which
   can be used to provide limited Internet access via Network Address
   Translation (NAT).  A discussion of the advantages and disadvantages
   of NATs is outside the scope of this document.  Nonetheless, it must
   be acknowledged that NAT is adequate in some situations and not in
   others.  For instance, it is often technically feasible to use NAT or
   even multiple layers of NAT within the networks operated by
   residential users or corporations where peer to peer communication is
   not needed.  Where peer to peer communication is needed or where
   services or applications do not work properly behind NAT, globally
   unique address space is required.

   In many cases it is possible to use multiple layers of NAT to re-use
   parts of the address space defined in [RFC1918].  In particular, the
   tendency for low-cost CPEs to use 192.168.0.0/16 as the default
   address range for the LAN allows providers to make full use of
   172.16.0.0/12 and 10.0.0.0/8.

4.  Available Options

   When a network operator has exhausted the private address space set
   aside in [RFC1918] but needs to continue operating a single routing
   domain a number of options are available.  These include:

4.1.  Unique Globally Scoped IPv6 Unicast Addresses

   Using unique, globally scoped IPv6 unicast addresses is the preferred
   option as it removes any concerns about address scarcity.  In some
   cases implementing a new network protocol on a very large network
   takes more time than is available, based on network growth and the
   proportion of private space that has already been used.  In these
   cases, there is a call for additional private address space that can
   be shared by all network operators.

4.2.  Unique Locally Scoped IPv6 Unicast Addresses

   Using the unique, locally scoped IPv6 unicast addresses defined in
   [RFC4193] is another approach and does not require coordination with
   an Internet registry.  Although the addresses defined in [RFC4193]
   are probabilistically unique, network operators on private internets
   and those providing VPN services might not want to use them because
   there is a very low probability of non-unique locally assigned global
   IDs being generated by the algorithm.  Also, in the case of private
   internets, it can be very challenging to coordinate the introduction
   of a new network protocol to support the internet's continued growth.

4.3.  Address Transfers or Leases From Organizations with Available
      Address Space

   The Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) have recently been developing
   policies to allow organizations with available address space to
   transfer such designated space to other organizations.  In other
   cases, leases might be arranged.  This approach is only viable for
   operators of very large networks if enough address space is made
   available for transfer or lease and if the very large networks are
   able to pay the costs of these transfers.  It is not possible to know
   how much address space will become available in this way, when it
   will be available and how much it will cost.  For these reasons,
   address transfers will not be an attractive proposition to many large
   network operators.  Leases might not be attractive to some
   organizations if both parties cannot agree a suitable length of time.
   Also, the leasor might worry about its own unanticipated needs for
   additional IPv4 address space.

4.4.  Using Unannounced Address Space Allocated to Another Organization

   Some network operators have considered using IP address space which
   is allocated to another organizatiobn but is not publicly visible in
   BGP routing tables.  This option is very strongly discouraged as the
   fact that an address block is not visible from one view does not mean
   that it is not visible from another.  It is also possible that the
   registrant of the address block might want to increase its visibility
   to other networks in the future, causing problems for anyone using it
   unofficially.  In some cases there might also be legal risks involved
   in using address space officially allocated to another organization.

4.5.  Unique IPv4 Space Registered by an RIR

   The policy framework shared by the RIRs does not discriminate based
   on what an address is used to do, just on how efficiently the
   assigned addresses are used.  Unique IPv4 addresses registered by an
   RIR are potentially available to organizations whose networks have
   used all the addresses set aside in [RFC1918].  Nonetheless, network
   operators are naturally disinclined to request unique IPv4 addresses
   for a purpose that could be met with private addresses were it not
   for the size of the network.  Addresses assigned in this way are not
   available for anyone else to use and so their registration denies
   them to new entrants, including potential customers.


5.  Options and Consequences for Defining New Private Use Space

5.1.  Redefining Additional Unicast Space as Private Address Space

   It would be possible to re-designate a portion of the current global
   unicast IPv4 address space as private unicast address space.  Doing
   this could benefit a number of operators of large network for the
   short period before they complete their IPv6 roll-out.  However, this
   benefit incurs a cost by reducing the pool of global unicast
   addresses available to end users.

   When considering re-designating a portion of the current global
   unicast IPv4 address space as private unicast address space it is
   important to consider how much space would be used and for how long
   it would be sufficient.  Not all of the large networks making full of
   of the space defined in [RFC1918] would have their needs met with a
   single /8.  In 2005, [I-D.hain-1918bis] suggested reserving three /8s
   for this purpose.

   A further consideration is which of the currently unallocated IPv4
   unicast /8 blocks should be used for this purpose.  Using address
   space which is known to be used unofficially is tempting.  For

Internet-Draft           Additional Private IPv4          September 2009


   instance, 1.0.0.0/8, which was proposed in [I-D.hain-1918bis] is
   known to be used by a number of different users.  These include
   networks making use of HIP LSIs [RFC4423], [WIANA], [anoNet] and
   others.  There is anecdotal [VEGODA] and research [WESSELS] evidence
   to suggest that several other IPv4 /8s are used in this fashion.

   Although new IPv4 /8s are allocated approximately once a month, they
   are not easy to bring into use because network operators are slow to
   change their filter configurations.  This is despite long-running
   awareness campaigns [CYMRU], [LEWIS] and active work [ripe-351] to
   notify people whose filters are not changed in a timely fashion.
   Updating code that recognises private address space in deployed
   software and infrastructure systems is likely to be far more
   difficult as many systems have these ranges hard-coded and cannot be
   quickly changed with a new configuration file.

5.1.1.  Unique IPv4 Space Shared by a Group of Operators

   Where a group of networks find themselves in a position where they
   each need a large amount of IPv4 address space from an RIR in
   addition to that defined in [RFC1918] they might cooperatively agree
   to all use the same address space to number their networks.  The
   clear benefit to this approach is that it significantly reduces the
   potential demand on the pool of unallocated IPv4 address space.

   This approach has the potential to create an unofficial new private
   address range without proper scrutiny.

5.2.  Potential Consequences of Not Redefining Additional Unicast Space
      as Private Address Space

   If additional private address space is not defined and the large
   network operators affected by this problem are not able to solve
   their problems with IPv6 address space or by segmenting their
   networks into multiple routing domains, those networks will need
   unique IPv4 addresses.  It is possible and even likely that a single
   network could consume a whole IPv4 /8 in a year.  At the time of
   writing there are just 28 unallocated IPv4 /8s, so it would not take
   many such requests to make a major dent in the available IPv4 address
   space.

5.3.  Redefining Future Use Space as Unicast Address Space

   There have also been proposals to re-designate the former Class E
   space (240.0.0.0/4) as unicast address space.  [I-D.wilson-class-e]
   suggests that it should be privately scoped while
   [I-D.fuller-240space] does not propose a scope.  Both proposals note
   that existing deployed equipment may not be able to use addresses



Azinger & Vegoda         Expires March 12, 2010                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           Additional Private IPv4          September 2009


   from 240.0.0.0/4.  Potential users would need to be sure of the
   status of the equipment on their network and the networks with which
   they intend to communicate.

   It is not immediately clear how useful 240.0.0.0/4 could be in
   practice.  While [I-D.fuller-240space] documents the status of
   several popular desktop and server operating systems, the status of
   the most widely deployed routers and switches is less clear and it is
   possible that 240.0.0.0/4 might only be useful in very large, new
   greenfield deployments where full control of all deployed systems is
   available.  However, in such cases it might well be easier to deploy
   an IPv6 network.
