      <t>Middleboxes are defined as any intermediary box performing functions apart from normal,
        standard functions of an IP router on the data path between a source host and destination
        host. Two such functions are network address translation and firewalling.</t>
      <t>When Application Layer Gateways, such as SIP entities, interact with NATs and
        firewalls, as described in the MIDCOM architecture, then problems may occur
        in the transport of media traffic when signaling protocol interaction takes place along the
        media path, as it is the case for recent key exchange proposals (such as DTLS-SRTP).
        This document highlights problems that may arise.
        Unfortunately, it is difficult for the end points to detect or predict problematic behavior
        and to determine whether the media path is reliably available for packet exchange. </t>
      <t>This document aims to summarize the various sources and effects of NAT and firewall
        control, the reasons that they exist, and possible means of improving their behavior to
        allow protocols that rely upon signaling along the media path to operate effectively.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>According to by RFC 3234 <xref target="RFC3234"/> middleboxes are defined as any
        intermediary box performing functions apart from normal, standard functions of an IP router
        on the data path between a source host and destination host.</t>

      <t>In the context of SIP a SIP ALG may interact with a node along the media path to control
        network address translation, firewalling, and other functions. </t>
      <t>
        <list style="empty">

          <t> With firewall control packet filters are installed based on the SIP signaling
            interaction to implement a behavior of 'deny by default' in order to reduce the risk of
            unwanted traffic. This function is often referred to as 'gating'. Depending on the
            timing of the packet filter installation and the content of the packet filter signaling
            traffic along the media, such as DTLS-SRTP or ICE, may be treated in an unexpected way. </t>
          <t>In cases where the middlebox is involved in overcoming unmanaged NAT traversal the case
            is similar. The key feature of this type of NAT traversal is a desire to overcome the
            possible lack of information about any <xref target="RFC4787"/> address and/or port
            mapping by a possibly unknown NAT device (server reflexive address and filtering
            properties). In particular, a NAT binding for an endpoint may not exist yet for the
            address and port identified in the endpoint's SDP. As such, a pilot packet sent by that
            endpoint behind the NAT is required to create the necessary mappings in the NAT for the
            media relay to deliver media destined for that endpoint. Until that pilot packet is
            received no media packets may be reliably forwarded to the endpoint by the relay. </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t> This document presents a summary of these two techniques, discusses their impact upon
        other protocols such as ICE and DTLS-SRTP, and proposes a set of recommendations to mitigate
        the effects of gating and latching on in-band negotiation mechanisms. </t>

      <t>We use the terms filter, policy action (or action), policy rule(s), MIDCOM agent, and
        MIDCOM Policy Decision Point (PDP) as defined in <xref target="RFC3303"/>. The MIDCOM agent
        is co-located with a SIP ALG that comunicates with the firewall or the media relay.</t>

    <section anchor="gating" title="Architecture">
      <t><xref target="architecture"/> shows the architecture that is being considered in this
        document with respect to firewall and NAT traversal using media relaying. The timing and
        directionality with which media packets are allowed to traverse a particular edge device is
        the subject of this investigation. The MIDCOM agent thereby pushes policy rules to the
        middlebox that allow or deny certain flows to bypass. Additionally, in case of media
        relaying it is important for the MIDCOM agent to adjust the signaling messages.</t>

    </section>



    <section anchor="packet-filter" title="Packet Filtering">

      <t><xref target="architecture"/> highlights the interaction between the MIDCOM agent and the
        middlebox. These two elements inspect call control signaling and media path packets and
        determine when packets from a given source to a given destination are allowed to flow
        between endpoints. It is common for the gate controller to be the local outbound proxy for a
        given SIP UA being gated. </t>

      <t>The primary responsibility of the MIDCOM agent, which is co-located with a SIP entity, is
        to examine the call control signaling to determine the media addresses and ports used to
        define the media path between the gated device and the endpoint(s) with which it is
        corresponding. For SIP, this would correspond to the media addresses described within SDP
        after at least one full offer/answer exchange. </t>
      <t>This information is used to create one or more packet filters that describe the expected
        media path(s) for the call. These packet filters are combined with an algorithmic
        determination, typically based on the state of the call, as to which direction(s) media
        packets are allowed to flow between the endpoints, if at all. The filter and the action that
        is being installed by the MIDCOM agent at the middlebox may change during the lifetime of a
        SIP signaling session, depending on the state of the call or on changes of the address and
        port information of one (or even both) of the end points.</t>
      <t>It is possible that the gate controller may not be able to establish an exact address or
        port for one endpoint involved in the call in which case it may wildcard the address and/or
        port for the source and/or destination endpoint in the packet flow filter. In such a case,
        the packet flow filter is considered to have matched against a given media packet for the
        wildcarded field. </t>
      <t>Note that it is possible to specify the filter using wildcards, for example, if some end
        point address information is not known at a given point in time. Additonally, the default
        firewalling policy is subject to local configuration ('deny per default' vs. 'permit per
        default'). For a given SIP signaling sessions the policy at the MIDCOM agent might be very
        strict with respect to the packets that are allowed to flow in a particular direction. For
        example, packets may be allowed to flow in both directions, only in one direction for a
        specific media stream. No particular behavior can be assumed. </t>
      <t>When a media session is destroyed (end of call, deleted from the session description,
        etc.), the MIDCOM agent removes policy rules created for that media session at the
        middlebox.</t>

      <section title="Protocol Interaction">
        <t>MIDCOM agents may employ a variety of models to determine when to change the status of a
          particular policy rule. This is especially true when a call is being established. For SIP,
          this would be when an early dialog is established between endpoints. Although there is the
          potential for a great deal of variability due to an intentional lack of specification,
          typically, one of two models is used by the MIDCOM agent to determine the state of a
          policy rule during call setup: single-stage and two-stage commit. The term 'commit' here
          refers to the point at which a policy rule is setup that allows media traffic to flow. For
          example, this would be the point at which packets for a media stream marked a=sendrecv in
          SDP was allowed to flow bi-directionally by the middlebox.</t>

        <section title="Single-Stage Commit">
          <t>Single stage commit is commonly used when the MIDCOM agent is most involved only in
            firewalling. For SIP, MIDCOM agents use a single-stage commit model typically install
            policy rules for the call when the 200 OK to the INVITE is received in the case that the
            INVITE contained an SDP offer, or when the ACK is received if the initial offer was sent
            in the 200 OK itself.</t>
          <t>This model is often used to prevent media from being sent end-to-end prior to the call
            being established.</t>

          <t>In the example above, policy is created in steps 4 and 5 to allow bi-directional media
            flow based on the SDP exchanged in steps 1 and 3. In this example, the MIDCOM agent
            installes the policies after the 200 OK to the INVITE arrives in step 3. With a
            firewalling policy of 'deny by default' media sent prior to steps 5 and 4 by the UAC or
            UAS is discarded by the middleboxes. </t>
          <t>Noted that early media that arrives before the 200 OK would require special treatement
            since otherwise it would be dropped as well. </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Two-Stage Commit">
          <t>Two-stage commit is used when the MIDCOM agent also providers functionality, such as
            Quality of Service signaling that may require resources to reserved early on in the call
            establishment process before it is known if the call will be answered. An example of
            this would be where the MIDCOM agent is responsible for guaranteeing a minimum level of
            bandwidth along the media path. In this case an initial set of policies may be sent by
            the MIDCOM agent to the middlebox even though they are put into a pending state but
            trigger a resource reservation. Later, when the call is accepted, the gate controller
            may update the state of the policies to active them.</t>

          <t>In the example above, policies are created in steps 5 and 6 based off of the SDP sent
            in steps 1 and 3 in an initial inactive state (no packets are allowed to flow) despite
            the SDP indicating the media should be bi-directional. This interaction with the
            middlebox, however, triggers a QoS reservation to take place. Later, when the 200 OK to
            the INVITE comes in step 7, the policies are updated in steps 8 and 9 to indicate that
            packets should be allowed to flow bi-directionally. Although functionally equivalent to
            the single-stage commit example given earier in <xref target="single-stage-commit"/>,
            other operations at the gate agent may have been performed simultaneously in steps 5 and
            6 that justifies the early explicit definition of the gates in an inactive state. The
            full usage of PRACK here is not shown for purposes of brevity.</t>

      <section title="Further Reading">
        <t>Packet filtering based on the approach described in this document has been described in a
          number of documents. Although the usage of this architecture can also be found on the
          Internet their behavior is largely specified only in documents that relate to IMS
          standardization. The behavior of the devices deployed on the Internet is therefore largely
          undocumented. Nevertheless, the following documents give the reader a better idea of the
          functionality and the signaling interaction. These documents may also specify an
          additional behavior in relation to how packet filtering is used when the MIDCOM agent is
          responsible for processing SIP/SDP call control signaling and the middlebox is responsible
          for a variety of activities beyond pure filtering. For example, it is common for
          middleboxes to exempt RTCP flows from being blocked even though the associated RTP flows
          are not allowed to flow in order to support RTCP signaling while a call is on hold. These
          references are given here for the reader to gather a better understanding of how this is
          mechanism is used in various forums and is non-exhaustive:</t>

        <t>Note that different terms are used for the MIDCOM agent and the middlebox. For example,
          in an IMS context the MIDCOM agent would be part of the P-CSCF and PCRF elements or in
          TISPAN it would be part of the P-CSCF, A-RACF and SPDF that are involved in controlling
          gating operations. Many different elements perform the role of a middlebox: GSM GGSN, CDMA
          PDSN, SAE serving gateway, TISPAN A-BGF/C-BGF/I-BGF, PacketCable CMTS, etc. These

    <section anchor="nat-traversal" title="NAT Traversal">
      <t>One NAT traversal technique that is being used is based on media relay. As shown in <xref
          target="architecture"/> the MIDCOM agent that is being co-located with the SIP ALG
        functionality interacts with the middlebox that is also a NAT in order to request and
        allocate NAT bindings. A side effect of the interaction with a (double) NAT is that the
        media traffic is forced to traverse a certain NAT in both directions (also called media
        anchoring). </t>
      <t>This architecture could be compared with a STUN relay <xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-turn"/>
        that is being controlled by the MIDCOM agent rather than the end point itself. The
        motivation why this technique is being used in favor to other NAT traversal techniques is
        that clients do not have to support anything beyond RFC 3261 <xref target="RFC3261"/> and
        network administrators can control and apply local policy to the relay binding process in a
        centralized manner. </t>

      <section title="Protocol Interaction">
        <t>The MIDCOM agent's role is to inspect call control signaling and update media address and
          port values based upon media relay binding information allocated with the middlebox/media
          relay. For SIP, this minimally involves updating the c= and m= lines in the SDP, although
          some implementations may update other elements of the SDP for various reasons. </t>
        <t>Because the endpoints may not be able to gather a server reflexive address for their
          media streams, the MIDCOM agent employs the following algorithm to ensure that media can
          flow to the given endpoint:</t>

        <t>
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>Give the corresponding endpoint an address and port on the middlebox for them to send
              media to for the endpoint served by the MIDCOM agent.</t>
            <t>Give the served endpoint a different address and/or port on the middlebox for it to
              send media to for the corresponding endpoint.</t>
            <t>Use the address and port the corresponding endpoint supplies for media streams as the
              destination for packets sent to the middlebox by the served endpoint.</t>
            <t>Use the address and port of the first packet received from the served endpoint at the
              middlebox as the destination for packets sent to the middlebox by the corresponding
              endpoint.</t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>An example of this algorithm is shown in <xref target="latching_callflow"/> using SIP and
          SDP. In this example the UAC is the endpoint served by the MIDCOM agent, which is also
          acting as a local outbound proxy, and the UAS is the corresponding endpoint.</t>

    <section title="Interactions between Media Path Signaling and Middlebox Behavior">

      <t>This section points to the problems that occur when signaling exchanges are performed along
        the media path when middleboxes are present that behave in the way described in this
        document. </t>

      <section title="Firewalling">

        <t>The description in <xref target="packet-filter"/> highlighted that the timing of the policy rule
          installation by the MIDCOM agent towards the middlebox has an impact on when and what
          media traffic is allowed to traverse.</t>

        <t> Hence, the middlebox prevents the exchange of packets in the media path until the
          session establishment signaling has reached a pre-configured milestone where the MIDCOM
          agent signals to the middlebox that packets are allowed to traverse in both directions.
          Prior to this, packets may be allowed to flow uni-directionally to satisfy certain service
          requirements or may be entirely blocked by the middlebox. For SIP <xref target="RFC3261"/>
          the typically milestone that must be reached is offer/answer exchange <xref
            target="RFC3264"/> accompanied by an acknowledgement that the dialog has been accepted
          by the UAS (i.e., 200 OK to the INVITE). A concrete example of the impact can be found
          with the case of key exchange along the media path, as it is provided by DTLS-SRTP. Figure
          2 of <xref target="I-D.fischl-sipping-media-dtls"/> shows that the arrival of the SIP
          INVITE at the UAS triggers the DTLS handshake. This message would be blocked by the
          middlebox, as described in <xref target="packet-filter"/> since the MIDCOM agent has not
          yet installed policy rules. The consequence is that the DTLS key exchange is delayed until
          the policy rules are installed and that media traffic that is sent before the DTLS
          exchange is completed may be dropped and the user experiences clippping.</t>
        <t> Unlike with the pilot packet used for NAT traversal, the bi-directional media path is
          established via the signaling path, not via packets sent along the media path. In some
          deployment models, RTCP is always available bi-directionally regardless of the installed
          policy rules. Obviously, this is not a property that can be guaranteed to be true in the
          future.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="NAT Traversal">
        <t>The described NAT traversal interaction prevents asynchronous exchange of packets in the
          media path until a pilot packet has been received by the middlebox from the endpoint being
          served. It can be employed for both the <xref target="RFC3264"/> offerer and/or answerer.
          Therefore, in the worst case, both endpoints must generate a pilot packet towards each
          other to ensure a bi-directional media path exists. Any signaling on the media path that
          relies upon a uni-directional handshake in the reverse direction may not complete until
          media in the forward direction by the other endpoint. If signaling on the media path is
          required to complete prior to media generation the handshake may stall indefinitely.</t>

    <section title="Preliminary Recommendations">
      <t>The following preliminary recommendations are suggested:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="REC #1: ">It is recommended that any protocol handshake on the media path
            ensure that a mechanism exists that causes both endpoints to send at least one packet in
            the forward direction as part of, or prior to, the handshake process. Retransmission of
            STUN connectivity checks (see <xref target="I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis"/>) as part of
            ICE <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice"/> is an example of such a mechanism that
            satisfies this recommendation.</t>
          <t hangText="REC #2: ">It is recommended that middleboxes present on the media path allow
            a nominal amount of traffic to be exchanged between endpoints to enable completion of
            media path signaling prior to the session being established. The amount of traffic
            necessary to complete the signaling between endpoints is expected to be orders of
            magnitude smaller than that of any sufficiently interesting fraudulent traffic.</t>
          <t hangText="REC #3: ">It is recommended that failure to complete signaling on the media
            path not automatically cause the session establishment to fail unless explicitly
            specified by one or more endpoints. A fallback scenario where signaling on the media
            path is retried after the session has been established is recommended.</t>
