<abstract>
	<t>
	The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) has an IANA registry to allocate
	cryptographic algorithm suites for use in generating digital signatures over DNS data.
	Newly introduced cryptographic algorithms to DNSSEC mean implementors need to
	know which algorithms need to be implemented, which are optional, and which are obsolete.
	This document adds a column to the IANA registry table for Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC)
	Algorithm Numbers which lists their current status for use.

<section title="Introduction">
	<t>
	The Domain Name System (DNS) Security Extensions (DNSSEC) <xref target="RFC4033" />, <xref target="RFC4034" />,
	and <xref target="RFC4035" /> uses digital signatures over DNS data
	to provide source authentication and integrity protection.  DNSSEC uses an IANA registry
	to allocate codes for digital signature algorithms (consisting of a cryptographic
	algorithm and one-way hash function).   
	</t>
	<t>
	The original list of algorithm status is found in <xref target="RFC4034" />.
	Other DNSSEC documents have added new algorithms or changed the status of
	algorithms in the registry.  However, implementors
	must read through all the documents in order to discover which algorithms are mandatory to
	implement and which are optional or no longer used.  
	</t>
	<t>
    This document requests a column to be added to the IANA registry for Domain Name
	System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers.  This column will list the current status of each digital
	signature algorithm in the registry at the time of writing and assigns status for algorithms 
	used with DNSSEC that did not have a status when they were originally specified.  This 
	document updates the following: <xref target="RFC2536" />, <xref target="RFC2539" />, <xref target="RFC3110" />, 
	<xref target="RFC4034" />, <xref target="RFC4398" />, <xref target="RFC5155" />, <xref target="RFC5702" />, and [RFCTBD].
	</t>
<section title="Terms Used in this Document to Indicate Status">
	<t>The following terms are used within this document to indicate the current implementation
	   status of the given digital signature algorithm as of the time of writing.  Here, "implementation" 
	   refers to any component (e.g. validator, signer, etc.) that conforms to this document. Some of these
	   terms were used without definition in previous documents and are defined here.
	</t>
	<t><list style="hanging">
<t hangText="  ">MANDATORY:  Implementations MUST support this algorithm to be considered 
		currently inter-operable.  
	</t>
	<t hangText="  ">OPTIONAL:  Implementation MAY support this algorithm.  The presence
	or lack thereof this algorithm MUST NOT be used to judge conformance to this document.
	</t> 
	<t hangText="  ">ENCOURAGED: Implementations SHOULD support this algorithm, but like DISCRETIONARY, 
	lack of support MUST NOT be used to judge conformance to this document.  This term is also used to hint
	of a possible status change in the future to MANDATORY.
	</t>
	<t hangText="  ">OBSOLETE:  New implementations SHOULD NOT support this algorithm.  
	</t>
	</list>
	</t>
	<t>These words are also defined in <xref target="I-D.ogud-iana-protocol-maintenance-words" />, but 
	the definitions above are used for this document.
	</t>
</section>
<section title="Requirements Language">
    <t>The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;,
&quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
&quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;,
&quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be
interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />.
	</t>
</section>
</section>
<section title="DNS Security Algorithm Number Subregistry Fixes">
	<t>
	The DNS Security Algorithm Number subregistry (part of the Domain Name
	System (DNS) Security Number registry) will be modified to include a new column.
	This column will contain the current implementation requirements of the given 
	algorithm. This document does not make any changes to any other column in the 
	registry table.
	</t>
	<t>
        There are additional fixes to entries that are described in sub-section 2.1.
	The overall new registry table is in sub-section 2.2.  The values for the status
	were obtained from <xref target="RFC4034" /> with updates for algorithms
	specified after the original DNSSEC specification.  The status of algorithms marked
    OPTIONAL in <xref target="RFC4034" /> are changed to DISCRETIONARY as defined in 
    <xref target="I-D.ogud-iana-protocol-maintenance-words" />.  The status of algorithms
        marked NOT RECOMMENDED in <xref target="RFC4034" /> are changed to OBSOLETE as 
	defined in <xref target="I-D.ogud-iana-protocol-maintenance-words" />.
	</t>
  <section title="Individual Fixes">
        <t>
        This document changes three entries in the Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC)
	Algorithm Registry.  They are:
	</t>
	<t>
        The description for assignment number 4 is changed to "Reserved until 2020".
	</t>
	<t>
        The description for assignment number 9 is changed to "Reserved until 2020".
	</t>
	<t>
        The description for assignment number 11 is changed to "Reserved until 2020".</t> 
	<t>Registry entries 13-251 remains Unassigned.</t>
    <t>
        The status of RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1 and DSA-NSEC3-SHA1 are both set to DISCRETIONARY.
        The status of RSA/SHA-256 and RSA/SHA-512 are set to ENCOURAGED as it is believed 
        that these algorithms will replace older algorithms (e.g. RSA/SHA-1) that have a 
	perceived weakness in their hash algorithm (SHA-1).

<section title="Specifying New Algorithms and Updating Status of Existing Entries">
	<t>
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsext-dnssec-alg-allocation" /> establishes a parallel procedure for
	obtaining an algorithm number for new algorithms other than a standards track document.  
	Algorithms entered into the registry using that procedure are always OPTIONAL.
    	</t>
	<t>
	Adding a newly specified algorithm to the registry with any status other than OPTIONAL 
	SHALL entail an update of this document in order to specify new content to the registry.
	</t>

	Altering the status of any existing algorithm in the registry SHALL entail an update to

	<t>
	This document seeks to add a column (titled "Status") to the Domain Name System (DNS) Security Algorithm Numbers registry to
	indicate each algorithm's status for implementations seeking to conform to this document.  
	The new table is in Section 2.2 and includes the additional following changes detailed in Section 2.1:
	</t>
	<t>
        The description of assignment 4 is changed from "Reserved for ECC" to
        "Reserved until 2020".
	</t>
	<t>
        The description of assignment 9 is changed from "Unassigned" to "Reserved
	until 2020".

	<t>
        The description for assignment number 11 is changed from "Unassigned" to "Reserved until 2020".</t> 
	<t>Registry entries 13-251 remains Unassigned.</t>
	<t>
	The references for current algorithms in the table in Section 2.2 have been
	updated to remove obsolete RFC's and replaced with the current reference.
	</t>	
	<t>
	The references to FIPS 180 and FIPS 186 have been updated (to FIPS 180-3 and
	FIPS 186-3 respectively) to reflect the latest versions.  These revisions 
	are maintenance updates and the relevant content of the FIPS documents have 
	not changed.

	This draft updates the references of the entries that have an assigned status, in the table in Section 2.2, 
	the text '(this memo)' should be replaced with the final RFC when published.
