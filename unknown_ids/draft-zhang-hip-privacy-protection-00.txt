 1. Introduction  

    The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) [RFC5201] was proposed as a 
    comprehensive solution to address multiple critical issues (e.g., 
    mobility, multi-homing, and security) which the current Internet 
    infrastructure suffers from. In order to achieve this objective, HIP 
    separates the semantics of host identifier from IP addresses by 
    intercepting an "ID" layer in the middle of the network layer and 
    the transport layer. Compared with other ID/Locator separating 
    solutions (e.g., LISP, GSE, ILNP, etc.), HIP is security-inherent. 
    Each HIP host has a public key pair; the public key is used as the 
    Host Identifier (HI) transported over the Internet while the private 
    key is maintained locally. Additionally, a HIP host also needs to 
    generate a 128-bits long Host Identity Tag (HIT) by hashing its HI. 
    HITs are transported in the common parts of HIP headers and regarded 
    by upper layer protocols (e.g., TCP) as ordinary IPv6 addresses. 
    Before two HIP hosts communicate with each other, they use the HIP 
    Base Exchange protocol (HIP BEX) to verify each other's identity and 
    distribute secret materials for subsequent communications. Normally, 
    the HIT and HI of a host are supposed to be steadier than its 
    locator (i.e., IP address). Therefore, the changes in the location 
    of a host will not be detected by upper layer protocols. 

    In the current version of HIP BEX, the identities (i.e., HITs and 
    HIs) of communicating partners are transported in plaintexts. This 
    caused an identity privacy issue. In many scenarios, a user may want 
    to keep its identity confidential to other unrelated principals. 
    However, by eavesdropping HIP BEXs, it is possible for a third party 
    to identify a HIP host even when the host is attached to different 
    locations in the network. As a consequence, the activities of the 
    host can be glued to reason more useful information. The identity 
    privacy issue mentioned here is closely related with the location 
    privacy issues. As illustrated in [RFC4882], the roam of a mobile 
    host can be detected if any constant information related with the

 Internet-Draft      An Extension of HIP Base Exchange      March 2010 
                       to Support Identity Privacy                       
  
    host is detected by a third party. Such information can be a 
    Security Parameter Index (SPI) in an IPsec [RFC4301] header, an 
    Interface Identifier (IID) [RFC2462] in an IPv6 address that remains 
    unchanged across networks, the home address of a host supporting 
    mobile IP, the MAC address of a mobile host, an identifier of a 
    mobile host adopted in a upper layer protocol, and so on. Therefore, 
    in order to protect the privacy of a mobile host, a comprehensive 
    solution which cover multiple layers must be provided.  

    However, rather than attempting to address the overall privacy 
    problem, the solution specified in this document is only considered 
    with the identity privacy in the context of HIP, that is, it should 
    provide protection against the attempts to track HIP hosts by 
    inspecting the HITs and HIs transported in HIP BEXs.

 3. Overview of the Protocol  

    The proposed solution is an extension of BLIND, a framework for 
    protecting the identity privacy of hosts that are identified with 
    their public keys. In our solution, if an initiator of a HIP base 
    exchange intends to protect its identity privacy, it will not 
    transport its HI and HIT in plaintexts over the network. Instead, it 
    generates a scramble HIT, called the blinded HIT, for itself. If the 
    initiator intends to protect the identity privacy of its 
    communicating partner, it also needs to generate a blinded HIT for 
    the partner as well. A blinded HIT is generated by hashing the 
    concatenation of a nonce and the associated HIT. In an extended HIP 
    BEX, blinded HITs are transported in plaintext to distribute keying 
    materials, while the permanent HITs and HIs are transported only 
    after being encrypted with the symmetric keys shared between 
    communicating hosts.  

 4. Protocol Description 

    In order to benefit the discussion, assume there is a HIP host 
    called Initiator which intends to communicate with a HIP host called

    Responder. The HITs of Initiator are referred to as HIT-Is, and the 
    HITs of Responder are referred to as HIT-Rs. Additionally, the 
    blinded HITs of Initiator and Responder are referred to as B-HIT-Is 
    and B-HIT-Rs respectively. It is assumed that Initiator has got a 
    HIT-R and the associated public key through an out-of-band method 
    before initiating a BEX. 

 4.1. Base Exchange Extensions  

    In order to distinguish the proposed approach from the ordinary BEX 
    protocol, two control header bits, S and R are introduced. S 
    indicates that the unencrypted HI and HIT of the sender transported 
    in the HIP header are scrambled. R indicates that the unencrypted HI 
    and HIT of the sender transported in the HIP header are scrambled. 

 4.1.1. Blind Initiator and Responder 

    In the scenarios where the identity privacy of both communicating 
    partners needs to be protected, Initiator needs to generate a blind 
    HIT for itself and blind HIT for Responder before initiating a BEX.  

    In order to achieve this, Initiator first selects a random number 
    nonce, N. Then, Initiator generates a B-HIT-I by SHA-1 hashing the 
    concatenation of N and HIT-I, that is, B-HIT-I=SHA-1(N, HIT-I). In 
    the same way, Initiator generates a B-HIT-I for Responder. B-HIT-
    R=SHA-1(N, HIT-R). 

    An extended BEX handshake is illustrated in Figure 1. In the I1 
    packet, the blinded HITs of Initiator and Responder, and the nonce, 
    N, are transported in plaintexts. After receiving I1 packet, 
    Responder needs to calculate an SHA-1 hash value from the 
    concatenation of N and HIT-R, and compare it with the B-HIT-R 
    transported in the I1 packet. Note that if the Responder has 
    multiple HITs, this process may need to be performed recursively. If 
    there is no hash identical to the B-HIT-R, I1 packet will be 
    discarded. If a hash value matches the B-HIT-R, Responder sends a 
    pre-generated R1 packet of the associated HI to Initiator. In order 
    to protect the identity privacy, the HOST_ID parameter of the R1 
    packet contains a pseudonym (i.e., a random number) instead of the 
    HI. Responder needs to maintain the mapping from the pseudonym and 
    the associated HI. Because Initiator has already obtained an HI of 
    Responder, it can use the HI to assess the validity of the signature 
    of the R1 packet. If the signature is valid, Initiator generates a 
    symmetric key, KDH, using the Diffie-Hellman algorithm and adopts it 
    to calculate the keying material with the HIT-R and B-HIT-I:

                       to Support Identity Privacy                       
  
    Key1=SHA1 (KDH, HIT-R, B-HIT-I, 1), ...

    Keyn=SHA1 (KDH, HIT-R, B-HIT-I, n), 

    Keying material=Key1 XOR ... XOR Keyn. 

    The keying material is then used to generate a symmetric key to 
    encrypt the HIT-I and the associated identifier. The encrypted 
    information is sent to Responder in an I2 packet. Additionally, the 
    I2 packet also contains the nonce used to be transported in I1 and 
    the pseudonym used to be transported in R1. After receiving the I2 
    packet, Responder computes a key in the same way as the Initiator. 
    Using the key, Responder decrypts the HIT and HI information of 
    Initiator, and verifies the correctness of B-HIT-I. Moreover, 
    Responder encrypts its HI and transported it to Initiator in a R2 
    packet. After Initiator receives the R2 packets, it decrypts and 
    verifies Responder's HI. To this step, the whole BEX handshake 
    completes successfully. In the packets transported in the exchange, 
    both R and S are set.

 4.1.2. Blind Initiator 

    In the many circumstances, only the identity privacy of Initiator 
    needs to be protected. For instance, a client may want to keep its 
    identity untraceable to any third party, while a public server needs 
    not to. In this case, Initiator only needs to generate a blind HIT 
    for itself before initiating a BEX. The process of generating B-HIT-
    I is as same as that illustrated in section 4.1.1. Then Initiator 
    sends an I1 packet to Responder (see Figure 2). The packet consists 
    of B-HIT-I, the actual HIT of Responder (HIT-R), and the nonce used

    in generating B-HIT-I. After receiving I1, Responder sends back 
    Initiator a R1 packet. The process of generating the R1 packet is 
    identical to what has specified in the ordinary BEX. Upon receiving 
    R1, Initiator verifies the validity of R1 and calculates the keying 
    material in the same way illustrated in section 4.1.1. In addition, 
    Initiator encrypts its HIT and HI using a key derived from the 
    keying material and transports the encrypted information in I2. 
    Therefore, after receiving I2, Responder can compute a symmetric key 
    to verify the correctness of B-HIT-I. The symmetric key is also used 
    to calculate the HMAC of the R2 packet sent to Initiator. Therefore, 
    by verifying the HMAC of R2, Initiator can prove that Responder has 
    share a symmetric key with it. In this exchange, the control flag S 
    of I1 and I2 is set while the control flag R of R1 and R2 is set.

 4.1.4. Blind not Supported at Initiator or Responder 

    If Initiator uncovers the HIT or HI of Responder in I1, there is no 
    opportunity left for Responder to decide whether to protect its 
    identity privacy. Thus, if Initiator does not know whether its 
    communicating partner needs to keep its identity private or not, it 
    can generate a blind HIT for the partner and transport it in I1. If 
    the partner does not need to protect the privacy of its identity, it 
    finds out the associated HIT and HI, and sends them back in R1 
    without encryption. In R1, only the control flag R in R1 is set. 
    Thus, the overheads in encrypting and transporting the HIT and HI in 
    R2 are avoided.

    In some circumstances, the responder in a BEX may expect the 
    identity of the initiator to be kept unrevealed. Such a host can 
    discard the I1 packets whose control flag bit S is zero and reply 
    with ICMP messages or notifications.

 5.1. Control header flags 

    In order to distinguish the packets in extended BEX from those in 
    ordinary BEX, two control header flags are defined here: 

          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

          | | | | | | | | | | | | | |R|S| | 

          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

    S: if this bit is set to 1, the sender's HIT and HI in this packet 
    are not transported in plaintexts. Otherwise, the sender sends its 
    ordinary HIT and HI in the common part of the packet header in 
    plaintext. 

    R: if this bit is set to 1, the receiver's HIT and HI in this packet 
    are not transported in plaintexts. Otherwise, the receiver's HIT and 
    HI are transported in the common part of the packet header without 
    encryption.

 6.2. Comparison of Disposable Identities vs. Blind 

    During the design of the proposed approach, the solutions using 
    ephemeral identities are also considered. A host can attempt to 
    prevent itself from being tracked by using different HIs in 
    different BEXs. However, some upper layer server applications may 
    use HIs or HITs to identify hosts. When a host uses ephemeral HI, it 
    may be difficult for the applications to find proper state to 
    provide service correctly. To avoid this problem, the Initiator can 
    use an ephemeral HIT to initiate a HIT to transport its permanent HI 
    an HIT in the encrypted part of I2. The Responder in the BEX can 
    also use an ephemeral HIT to distribute keying material securely and 
    transport its permanent HI an HIT in the encrypted part of R2, in 
    order to protect its identity privacy. Compared with our approach, 
    this solution is also effective in protecting identity privacy but 
    relatively inefficient. This solution needs to keep generating 
    ephemeral public key pairs, which is much more cumbersome than our 
    hash based approach. In addition, in this solution a host may have 
    to maintain multiple public key pairs when it simultaneously 
    communicates with different hosts. In our solution, a host can use a 
    single key pair to communicate with different hosts while keeping 
    the identity private, which largely simplifies key management. 
    Moreover, in our approach, communicating partners can use their 
    permanent private keys to sign the packets transported within a BEX. 
    Therefore, a host can easily verify whether its communicating 
    partner possesses the HI and HIT as it claimed in BEX. In this 
    solution, however, communicating partners use their ephemeral 
    private keys to sign such packets. Because the ephemeral HI key 
    pairs and permanent HI key pairs are cryptographically unassociated, 
    a host needs to spend additional efforts to prove its possession on 
    the permanent HI transported in the encrypted part of HIP packets.
