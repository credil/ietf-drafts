            Header Field Parameter for Media Plane Security
             draft-dawes-dispatch-mediasec-parameter-00.txt

Abstract

   Negotiating the security mechanisms used between a Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) user agent and its next-hop SIP entity is already
   described in an RFC.  This document extends negotiation of a security
   mechanism to the media plane by defining a new Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) header field parameter to label security mechanisms
   that apply to the media plane.

Internet-Draft          Media Security Parameter           February 2010


1.  Introduction

   RFC 3329 [1] describes negotiation of a security mechanism for SIP
   signalling between a UAC and its first hop proxy.  This document
   extends the concept of security negotiation by added exchange of
   security capability for the media plane.  Similar to the signalling
   plane, the evolution of security mechanisms for media often
   introduces new algorithms, or uncovers problems in existing ones,
   making negotiation of mechanisms a necessity.

   The purpose of this specification is to define negotiation
   functionality for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [1].  This
   negotiation is intended to work only between a UA and its first-hop
   SIP entity.

1.1.  Motivations

   RFC3329 describes why security is needed to protect SIP signalling
   from man-in-the-middle attacks, and to accomodate the expected wide
   variation in security mechanism support by SIP entities.  The media
   plane requires similar protection and capability, for example to
   prevent eavesdropping in environments such as public wireless access
   networks that have no inherent security.

1.2.  Design Goals

   Security on the media plane differs from security for signalling,
   because it is applied per media stream and also because multiple
   media streams can be started and stopped within a single SIP session.
   For a single media stream, any one of the media plane security
   mechanisms supported by client and server may be applied, or no media
   plane security may be applied at all.  Therefore, this specification
   defines secure capability exchange and use of security mechanisms for
   media, but with no obligation to use the indicated security
   mechanisms.

   1.  The entities involved in the security agreement process need to
       find out exactly which security mechanisms to apply, preferably
       without excessive additional roundtrips.

   2.  The selection of security mechanisms itself needs to be secure.
       Traditionally, all security protocols use a secure form of
       negotiation.  For instance, after establishing mutual keys
       through Diffie-Hellman, IKE sends hashes of the previously sent
       data including the offered crypto mechanisms [8].  This allows
       the peers to detect if the initial, unprotected offers were
       tampered with.

Internet-Draft          Media Security Parameter           February 2010


   3.  The security agreement process should not introduce any
       additional state to be maintained by the involved entities.


2.  Solution

   This document defines the "mediasec" header field parameter that
   labels any of the Security-Client:, Security-Server:, or Security-
   Verify: header fields as applicable to the media plane and not the
   signalling plane.  Any one of the mechanisms labelled with the
   "mediasec" header field parameter can be applied on-the-fly as a
   media stream is started, unlike mechanisms for signalling one of
   which is chosen and then applied throughout a session.

2.1.  Relationship to RFC3329

   As stated earlier, RFC 3329 [1] defines security mechanism agreement
   for signalling, including the "sec-agree" option tag that can appear
   in Supported:, Require:, and Proxy-Require: header fields.  The
   "mediasec" header field parameter defined in this document places no
   requirements to support any function in RFC 3329 [1].  In other
   words, media plane security can be supported without implementing any
   of RFC 3329 [1], it is only the header field names that are re-used.
   A user agent or proxy that does not implement RFC 3329 [1] or this
   document and receives the Security-Client;, Security-Server; and
   Security-Verfiy; header fields containing only media plane security
   mechanisms, labelled with the "mediasec" header field parameter, will
   ignore them as unknown, and will not include these header fields in
   its response, thereby informing the entity that sent them that this
   document is not supported.  This document adds 200 (OK) to the SIP
   responses that can contain the Security-Client, Security-Server, and
   Security-Verfiy header fields; RFC 3329 [1] allows Security-Server
   only in SIP responses 421 (Extension Required) and 494 (Security
   Agreement Required).

2.2.  Overview of Operation

   The message flow is identical to the flow in RFC 3329 [1], with the
   exceptions that it is not mandatory for the user agent to apply media
   plane security immediately after it receives the list of supported
   media plane mechanisms from the server, or any timer after that, nor
   will the lack of a mutually supported media plane security mechanism
   prevent SIP session setup.  In the message flow below, only Step 3
   differs from RFC 3329 [1].

   Step 1: Clients wishing to use this specification can send a list of
   their supported security mechanisms along the first request to the
   server.

   Step 2: Servers wishing to use this specification can challenge the
   client to perform the security agreement procedure.  The security
   mechanisms and parameters supported by the server are sent along in
   this challenge.

   Step 3: The client may then proceed to select any media security
   mechanism they have in common and to turn on the selected security.

   Step 4: The client contacts the server again, now using the selected
   security mechanism.  The server's list of supported security
   mechanisms is returned as a response to the challenge.

   Step 5: The server verifies its own list of security mechanisms in
   order to ensure that the original list had not been modified.

2.3.  Syntax

2.4.  Protocol Operation

2.4.1.  The "mediasec" Header Field Parameter

   The "mediasec" header field parameter may be used in the Security-
   Client;, Security-Server; or Security-Verfiy; header fields defined
   in RFC 3329 [1] to indicate that a header field applies to the media
   plane.  Any one of the media plane security mechanisms supported by
   both client and server, if any, may be applied when a media stream is
   started.  Or, a media stream may be set up without security.

   The value of the "mediasec" header field parameter will be specific
   to the security mechanism applied and the secure media transport
   protocol.  This document defines the following value:

3.  Backwards Compatibility

   Security mechanisms that apply to the media plane only MUST NOT have
   the same name as any signalling plane mechanism.  If a signalling
   plane security mechanism name is re-used for the media plane and
   distinguished only by the "mediasec" parameter, then implementations
   that do not understand the "mediasec" parameter may incorrectly use
   that security mechanism for the signalling plane.


4.  Examples

   tbd.

4.1.  Client Initiated

   As per RFC 3329 [1], a UA negotiates the security mechanism for
   signalling to be used with its outbound proxy without knowing
   beforehand which mechanisms the proxy supports as shown below.

   Indication of media security mechanisms is added and identified by
   the "mediasec" header field parameter.  Media security mechanisms are
   returned by the client to the server in the Security-Verify: header
   field in the same way as for signalling security mechanisms.
