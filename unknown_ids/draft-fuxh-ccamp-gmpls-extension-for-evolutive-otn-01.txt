Internet-Draft      GMPLS Extension for Evolutive OTN          July 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the extensions of GMPLS signaling to control
   Optical Transport Networks (OTN) including ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU2e,
   ODU3, ODU3e1, ODU3e2, ODU4 and ODUflex.  It also covers the
   interworking of control plane between pre-G.709 controlling and G.709
   Amendment3 controlling.  The control of ODUflex resizing is for
   further study.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  GMPLS Extension for G.709 Amendment3 and G.sup43-Overview

   The concept of Lower Order (LO) ODUk and High Order (HO) ODUk in the
   G.709 Amendment3 multiplex hierarchy is introduced as same
   information structures but with different client signals.  LO-ODUk
   can be considered as the service layer and the HO-ODUk can be
   considered as the Tunnel Layer.  LO-ODUk can be multiplexed into the
   HO-ODUk or can be mapped directly to OTUk layer.

   The LO-ODUk into HO-ODUk multiplexing and OCh into OMSn multiplexing
   provide a two stage multiplexing capability.  ODU0 are to be
   transported over ODUk (k=1,2,3,4) and ODU2e are to be transported
   over ODUk ( k=3,3e1,3e2,4).

   The ability to accommodate any client bit rate into a variable bit
   rate LO-ODU and map into any number of Tributary Slots of HO-ODU i.e.
   being agnostic to the service bit rate and provide flexibility to the
   mapping process creates a future proof multi service OTN evolution.
   ODUflex is a LO-ODU that enhances bit transparent transport over OTN.
   It can be of any rate of ODU0 rate or higher and has a generic
   capacity.

   GMPLS signaling extensions for pre-G.709 has been described in
   [RFC4328].  It extended the Generalized Label Request, the
   Generalized Label and Traffic Parameter.  This document give more
   extension for the G.709 Amendment3 and G.sup43.  It covers the
   Generalized Label, Traffic Parameters.  It also give some
   consideration about the interworking of control plane between pre-
   G.709 controlling and G.709 Amendment3 controlling.

   To support the application of ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU2e, ODU3, ODU3e1,
   ODU3e2 and ODU4, the extensions based on [RFC4328] are needed.  The

   first extension defines signal Type of these ODUk in G.709 Traffic
   Parameters.  The second extension provides the compatible definition
   of ODUk Label.

   ODUflex should be more further study in the future (e.g., Control of
   ODUflex resizing).


3.  Generalized Label Request

   [RFC4328] extends the LSP Encoding Type, the Switching Type, and
   G-PID (Generalized-PID) values to accommodate G.709 Recommendation
   [ITUT-G.709].  Signaling of ODU0, ODU1, ODU2e, ODU4, ODUflex, ODU3e1
   and ODU3e2 LSP must comply with these extensions.  Additional LSP
   Encoding Type code-point for the OTN Digital Path layer must be used
   for these new ODUk types LSP and their switching types belong to the
   TDM class.

   G.709 Amendment3 clarifies that the layer stack of the OTN contains a
   Lover Order ODU layer in which each LO-ODU signal carries a customer
   service instance, and a Higher Order ODU layer in which each HO-ODU
   signal carries a multiplex of LO-ODU signals.  But the Encoding Types
   of LO and HO layer are aslo G.709 ODUk (Digital Path) which is
   defined in [RFC4328].

   When the client payload is transported over the Optical Channel
   layer, [RFC4328] defines the Generalized-PID with respect to the LSP
   Encoding Type for G.709 OTUk at 2.5, 10, 40 Gbps.  This G-PID type
   should be extended to support the transport of Digital Section at
   100G Gbps.

3.1.  Traffic Parameters

   G.709 traffic parameters has been defined in [RFC4328].  The
   backwards compatibility must be considered.  Backwards compatibility
   considerations for each feature will be covered in this document.
   The definition of Number of Virtual Components (NVC) and Multiplier
   (MT) is same as [RFC4328]

3.1.1.  Signal Type (ST)

   Pre-G.709 defines the OPU2 and OPU3 with 2.5G tributary slots
   multiplex structure.  G.709 Amendment3 defines the OPU1, OPU2, OPU3,
   OPU4 with 1.25G tributary slots multiplex structure.  G.sup43 defines
   the OPU3e1 with 2.5G tributary slots multiplex structure and OPU3e2
   with 1.25G tributary slots multiplex structure.

   Following is the Signal Type extended for G.709 Amendment3 and

   G.sup43.  Values from 0 to 8 are defined in [RFC4328].  The size of
   OPU2 and OPU3 tributary slots which are define in [RFC4328] is 2.5G.
   Other new Signal Types are extended for G.709 Amendment3 and G.sup43.

4.  Backward Compatibility Considerations

   Equipment supporting a 1.25G TS structure for OPU2 or OPU3 must be
   backward compatible with equipment which supports only the 2.5G TS
   structure.  Also, the extension defined in this document is backward
   compatible with [RFC4328] for ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3.  So the extension
   defined in this document is a supplement and extension of [RFC4328].

   In terms of G.709 Amendment3, a one-byte payload type signal is
   defined in the PSI[0] byte of the payload structure identifier to
   indicate the composition of the OPUk signal.  The code points can
   differentiate whether the ODU multiplex structure supports 2.5G
   tributary slots or 1.25G tributary slots.  Also, in order to be
   backward compatible with [RFC4328] for ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3, it needs
   the Signal Type charactering the ODU multiplex structure to
   differentiate the size of tributary slots and the Generalized Label
   format.

   When a downstream (upstream)node receive Path (Resv) message in which
   Signal Type (i.e., ODU1, ODU2 or ODU3) characters ODU multiplex

   structure supporting 2.5G tributary slots, it must identifies the
   Generalized Label format based on [RFC4328].

   When a downstream (upstream) node receive Path (Resv) message in
   which Signal Type (i.e., ODU1, ODU2 or ODU3) characters ODU multiplex
   structure supporting 1.25G tributary slots, it must identifies the
   Generalized Label format based on this document.

   Following is a example of backward compatibility for ODU1, ODU2 and
   ODU3.  For instance, we need to setup a ODU1 (2.5G bandwidth) LSP
   between node 1 and nodes 3.  Node 2 must identify the Generalized
   Label format based on [RFC4328] after receiving the Path message.
   Node 2 must identify the Generalized Label format based on this
   document after receiving the Resv message.  In other hand, node 3
   must identify the Generalized Label format based on this document.

                      Backward Compatibility Scenario

   Control plane designed for G.709 Amendment3 and G.sup43 should have
   the ability to synchronously process the different Generalized Label
   format of ODU2 and ODU3 defined in [RFC4328] and this document.  The
   Generalized Label format is identified by the Signal Type in Traffic
   Parameters.

   When a downstream node receive Path message in which Signal Type is
   ODU0, ODU2e, ODUflex, ODU4, ODU3e1 or ODU3e2, it must identifies the
   Generalized Label format based on this document.

   If one node receives a Path message in which the Signal Type
   characters the ODU multiplex structure, it must check the local
   mapping capability.  If it can not support this ODU multiplex
   structure, the Path message will be terminated, and a PathErr message
   with a "Traffic Control Error/Service unsupported" indication will be
   generated.


5.  Generalized Label

5.1.  Label Space

   G.709 Amendment3 has been added many different client payload bit
   rates which are mainly based on Gigabit Ethernet.  An Optical Data
   Unit (ODU) frame has been defined for each of these bit rates.  ODUk
   refers to the frame at bit rate k, where k = 0 (for 1.2G Gbps which
   is sepecially introduced for GE client signal), 1 (for 2.5 Gbps CBR),
   2 (for 10 Gbps including CBR and GE LAN), 2e (also for 10 Gbps which
   is sepecially introduced for FC1200 and GE LAN client signal), 3 (for
   40 Gbps including CBR and GE) or 4 (for 100 Gbps which is sepecially
   introduced for GE client signal).  ODU0 can be mapped into ODU1,
   ODU2, ODU3, ODU4.  ODU1, ODU2 and ODU3 can be mapped into ODU4.
   ODU2e can be mapped into ODU3, ODU3e1, ODU3e2 and ODU4.  ODU1 can be
   is mapped into 1.25G tributary slots of OPU2 and OPU3.  ODU2 can be
   is mapped into 1.25G tributary slots of OPU3.

   The ODUflex can be used for CBR clients and for packet clients.  The
   existing G.709 mappings for CBR clients into ODU0, 1, 2, 3 will
   continue to be used.  New ODUflex mappings will not be defined for
   these clients.  The CBR ODUflex rate should be 239/238*client bit
   rate.  The Packet ODUflex bit rate is based on an incremental number
   of tributary slots of the ODUk (k=2, 3, 4) expected to carry the
   ODUflex.  The Packet ODUflex rate should be n*1.24416 Gbps+/-20ppm
   (1<=n<=80).  CBR ODUflex and Packet ODUflex are transported by
   mapping into an integer number of TS of an OPUk (of a High Order
   ODUk) for k>1.  There is no OTUflex.

   Most Lower Order ODUk signals have the same number of tributary slots
   in all High Order ODUk(i.e.  HO OPUk signals).  There are however a
   few exceptions; the most well known is LO ODU2e (i.e.  LO ODU
   10.399G).  ODU2e fits into 5*2.5G tributary slots of OPU3, 9*1.25G
   tributary slots of OPU3, or 8*1.25G tributary slots of OPU4.

   Following is the ODUk label format for the G.709 Amendment3 and
   G.sup43.


    0                   1                   2                   3

   The specification of the fields t1, t2, t3 and t4 self-consistently
   characterizes the ODUk label space.  The value space for the t1, t2,
   t3, t4, t5 and t6 fields is defined as follows:

   1.  t1 (2-bit):

       *  t1=[1..2] indicates the tributary slot (t1th) used by the ODU0
          in an ODTUG1 (via ODTU01) mapped into an ODU1 (via OPU1).
          ODU0 is mapped into 1.25G tributary slots of OPU1.

       *  t1 is not significant for the other ODUk signal types (i.e.,
          t1 value MUST be set to 0 and ignored).

   2.  t2 (5-bit):

       *  t2=[1..8] indicates the tributary slot (t2th) used by the ODU0

          OPU3e1.  Four labels need to be allocated for one ODU2e
          connection.  They may be continuous or non-continuous.

          The mapping of ODU2e into four 2.5G tributary slots is defined
          in the non normative G.sup43.  Two control planes controlling
          G.sup43 network elements which will be interworked should base
          on this Generalized Label format.

          OPU3e2.  Eight labels need to be allocated for one ODU2e
          connection.

          The mapping of ODU2e into eight 1.25G tributary slots is
          defined in the non normative G.sup43.  Two control planes

          the ODU2e in an ODTUG3 (via ODTU2e3)mapped into an ODU3 (via
          OPU3).  ODU2e is mapped into 2.5G tributary slots of OPU3.
          Five labels need to be allocated for one ODU2e connection.
          They may be continuous or non-continuous.

          The option of mapping clients into 2.5G tributary slots of
          ODU3 using GMP would be removed from consideration and from
          the draft revised G.709 (resulting in the mapping for ODU2e
          into five 2.5G tributary slots would not be supported in
          favour of using GMP mapping into nine 1.25G tributary slots).
          So this label definition may be removed in the future.

5.2.  Label Distribution Rules

   It was noted that VCAT is only defined currently for ODU1, ODU2, and
   ODU3.  The draft revision of G.709 Amendment3 will not define VCAT
   for ODU1, ODU2e and ODU4.  So there is no any necessary extension for
   the new ODUk signal.  The label distribution rules must be same as
   [RFC4328].

5.3.  Calculation of Label Number for ODUflex

   For an ODUflex that is based on transport of a particular physical
   layer client (e.g., ODU2e) the size of the ODUflex depends on that
   client.  In general, it is a bit-synchronous mapping of the client
   with the ODUflex bit-rate being 239/238 times the bit-rate of the
   client. for this type of ODUflex, the number of tributary slots is
   chosen to fit.

   For example, ODU2e fits into 5*2.5G tributary slots of OPU3 (i.e.,
   Five labels need to be allocated for one ODUflex connection when
   ODUflex is mapped into 2.5G tributary slots of ODU3), 9*1.25G
   tributary slots of OPU3 (i.e., Nine labels need to be allocated for
   one ODUflex connection when ODUflex is mapped into 1.25G tributary
   slots of OPU3), or 8*1.25G tributary slots of OPU4 (i.e., Eight
   labels need to be allocated for one ODUflex connection when ODUflex
   is mapped into 1.25G tributary slots of OPU4).

   For an ODUflex to provide flexibly sized trunks for packet transport,
   the granularity is selected to provide a reasonably efficient mapping
   into tributary slots of high order OPU2, OPU3, and OPU4.  A good
   choice here seems to be to allow these trunks to be provisioned in
   sizes of n*1.24416G+/-20ppm (1<=n<=80).  The number of labels is from
   1 to 80.

5.4.  Example of Generalized Label

   The following examples are given in order to illustrate the
   processing described in this document.

   1.   ODU2e in OTU2e mapping or ODU4 in OTU4 mapping: when one ODU2e
        (ODU4) signal is directly transported in an OTU2e (OTU4),the
        upstream node requests results simply in an ODU2e (ODU4) signal
        request.

        In such conditions, the downstream node has to return a unique
        label because the ODU2e (ODU4) is directly mapped into the
        corresponding OTU2e (OTU4).  Because a single ODUk signal is
        requested, the downstream node has to return a single ODUk
        label, which can be, for instance, one of the following:

       - Signal type=14, t4=1, t3=0, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates a single ODU4 mapped into an OTU4

       - Signal type=15, t4=0, t3=0, t2=31, t1=0;
         indicates a single ODU2e mapped into an OTU2e

   2.   ODU0 into ODUk multiplexing (k = 1, 2, 3 or 4): when one ODU0 is
        multiplexed into the payload of a structured ODU1 (ODU2, ODU3 or
        ODU4), the upstream node requests results simply in an ODU0
        signal request.

        In such conditions, the downstream node has to return a unique
        label because the ODU0 is multiplexed into one ODTUG1 (ODTUG2,
        ODTUG3 or OTDUG4).  The latter is then mapped into the ODU1
        (ODU2, ODU3 or ODU4) via OPU1 (OPU2, OPU3 or OPU4) and then
        mapped into the corresponding OTU1 (OTU2, OTU3 or OTU4).
        Because a single ODU0 multiplexed signal is requested (Signal
        Type = 10 and NMC = 1), the downstream node has to return a
        single ODU0 label, which can take, for instance, one of the
        following values:

       - t4=0, t3=0, t2=0, t1=2;
         indicates the ODU0 in the 1st TS of the ODTUG1

       - t4=0, t3=0, t2=5, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU0 in the 4th TS of the ODTUG2

       - t4=0, t3=27, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU0 in the 26th TS of the ODTUG3

       - t4=69, t3=0, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU0 in the 68th TS of the ODTUG4

   3.   ODU1 into 1.25G tributary slots of OPUk (k = 2, 3, 4)
        multiplexing: when one ODU1 is multiplexed into the payload of a
        structured ODU2 (ODU3 or ODU4), the upstream node requests
        results simply in an ODU1 signal request.

        In such conditions, the downstream node has to return two labels
        because the ODU1 is multiplexed into one ODTUG2 (ODTUG3 or
        ODTUG4).  The latter is then mapped into the ODU2 (ODU3 or ODU4)
        via OPU2 (OPU3 or OPU4) and then mapped into the corresponding
        OTU2 (OTU3 or OTU4).  Because a single ODU1 multiplexed signal
        is requested (Signal Type = 11 and NMC = 2), the downstream node
        has to return two ODU1 labels, which can take, for instance, the
        following values:

       - t4=0, t3=0, t2=14, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU1 in the 5th 1.25G TS of the ODTUG2

         or

       - t4=0, t3=59, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU1 in the 26th 1.25G TS of the ODTUG3

         or

       - t4=83, t3=0, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU1 in the 1st 1.25G TS of the ODTUG4

   4.   ODU2 into 1.25G tributary slots of OPU3: when one ODU2 is
        multiplexed into the payload of a structured ODU3, the upstream
        node requests results simply in an ODU2 signal request.

        In such conditions, the downstream node has to return eight
        labels because the ODU2 is multiplexed into one ODTUG3.  The
        latter is then mapped into the ODU3 via OPU3 and then mapped
        into the corresponding OTU3.  Because a single ODU1 multiplexed
        signal is requested (Signal Type = 12 and NMC = 8), the
        downstream node has to return eight ODU2 labels, which can take,
        for instance, the following values:

       - t4=0, t3=68, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU1 in the 3rd 1.25G TS of the ODTUG3

       - t4=0, t3=74, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU1 in the 9th 1.25G TS of the ODTUG3

       - t4=0, t3=83, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU1 in the 18th 1.25G TS of the ODTUG3

   5.   ODU2/ODU2e into ODU4 multiplexing: when one ODU2 (or ODU2e) is
        multiplexed into the payload of a structured ODU4, the upstream
        node requests results simply in an ODU2 (or ODU2e) signal
        request.

        In such conditions, the downstream node has to return eight
        labels because the ODU2 (ODU2e) is multiplexed into one ODTUG4.
        The latter is then mapped into the ODU4 via OPU4 and then mapped
        into the corresponding OTU4.  Because a single ODU2 (or ODU2e)
        multiplexed signal is requested (Signal Type = 12 and NMC = 8 or
        Signal Type = 15 and NMC = 8), the downstream node has to return
        eight ODU2 (or ODU2e) labels, one of which can take, for
        instance, the following values:

       - Signal type=12, t4=183, t3=0, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2 in the 21st TS of the ODTUG4

       - Signal type=15, t4=321, t3=0, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2e in the 79th TS of the ODTUG4

   6.   ODU3 into ODU4 multiplexing: when one ODU3 is multiplexed into
        the payload of a structured ODU4, the upstream node requests
        results simply in an ODU3 signal request.

        In such conditions, the downstream node has to return thirty-two
        labels because the ODU3 is multiplexed into one ODTUG4.  The
        latter is then mapped into the ODU4 via OPU4 and then mapped
        into the corresponding OTU4.  Because a single ODU3 multiplexed
        signal is requested (Signal Type = 13 and NMC = 32), the
        downstream node has to return thirty-two ODU3 labels, one of
        which can take, for instance, the following values:

       - t4=409, t3=0, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU3 in the 7th TS of the ODTUG4

       - t4=450, t3=0, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU3 in the 48th TS of the ODTUG4

       - t4=473, t3=0, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU3 in the 71st TS of the ODTUG4

   7.   ODU2e into 1.25G tributary slots of OPU3: when one ODU2e is
        multiplexed into the payload of a structured ODU3, the upstream
        node requests results simply in an ODU2e signal request.

        In such conditions, the downstream node has to return nine
        labels because the ODU2e is multiplexed into one ODTUG3.  The
        latter is then mapped into the ODU3 via OPU3 and then mapped
        into the corresponding OTU3.  Because a single ODU2e multiplexed
        signal is requested (Signal Type = 15 and NMC = 9), the
        downstream node has to return nine ODU2e labels, one of which
        can take, for instance, the following values:

       - t4=0, t3=101, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2e in the 4th 1.25G TS of the ODTUG3

       - t4=0, t3=113, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2e in the 16th 1.25G TS of the ODTUG3

       - t4=0, t3=121, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2e in the 24th 1.25G TS of the ODTUG3

   8.   ODU2e into ODU3e1 multiplexing: when one ODU2e is multiplexed
        into the payload of a structured ODU3e1, the upstream node
        requests results simply in an ODU2e signal request.

        In such conditions, the downstream node has to return four
        labels because the ODU2e is multiplexed into one ODTUG3e1.  The
        latter is then mapped into the ODU3e1 via OPU3e1 and then mapped
        into the corresponding OTU3e1.  Because a single ODU2e
        multiplexed signal is requested (Signal Type = 15 and NMC = 4),
        the downstream node has to return four ODU2e labels, which can
        take, for instance, the following values:

       - t4=0, t3=162, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2e in the 1st TS of the ODTUG3e1

       - t4=0, t3=167, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2e in the 6th TS of the ODTUG3e1

       - t4=0, t3=171, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2e in the 10th TS of the ODTUG3e1

       - t4=0, t3=176, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2e in the 15th TS of the ODTUG3e1

   9.   ODU2e into ODU3e2 multiplexing: when one ODU2e is multiplexed
        into the payload of a structured ODU3e2, the upstream node
        requests results simply in an ODU2e signal request.

        In such conditions, the downstream node has to return eight
        labels because the ODU2e is multiplexed into one ODTUG3e2.  The
        latter is then mapped into the ODU3e2 via OPU3e2 and then mapped
        into the corresponding OTU3e2.  Because a single ODU2e
        multiplexed signal is requested (Signal Type = 15 and NMC = 8),
        the downstream node has to return eight ODU2e labels, one of
        which can take, for instance, the following values:

       - t4=0, t3=182, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2e in the 5th TS of the ODTUG3e2

       - t4=0, t3=198, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2e in the 21st TS of the ODTUG3e2

       - t4=0, t3=208, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODU2e in the 31st TS of the ODTUG3e2

   10.  ODUflex is mapped into 1.25G tributary slots of OPU2 (OPU3 or
        OPU4). when one ODUflex is multiplexed into the payload of a
        structured ODU2 (ODU3 or ODU4), the upstream node requests

        results simply in an ODUflex signal request.

        In such conditions, the downstream node has to return some
        labels whose number is determined in terms of NMC value.
        Because the ODUflex is multiplexed into one ODTUG2 (ODTUG3 or
        ODTUG4).  The latter is then mapped into the ODU2 (ODU3 or ODU4)
        via OPU2 (OPU3 or OPU4) and then mapped into the corresponding
        OTU2 (OTU3 or OTU4).  Because a single ODUflex multiplexed
        signal is requested (Signal Type = 18), the downstream node has
        to return some labels (i.e., the number of labels is NMC), which
        can take, for instance, the following values:

       - t4=0, t3=0, t2=22, t1=0;
         indicates the ODUflex in the 5th 1.25G TS of the ODTUG2

         or

       - t4=0, t3=151, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODUflex in the 22nd 1.25G TS of the ODTUG3

         or

       - t4=369, t3=0, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODUflex in the 47th 1.25G TS of the ODTUG4

   11.  ODUflex is mapped into 2.5G tributary slots of OPU2 (or OPU3).
        when one ODUflex is multiplexed into the payload of a structured
        ODU2 (or ODU3), the upstream node requests results simply in an
        ODUflex signal request.

        In such conditions, the downstream node has to return some
        labels whose number is determined in terms of NMC valuce.
        Because the ODUflex is multiplexed into one ODTUG2 (or ODTUG3).
        The latter is then mapped into the ODU2 (or ODU3) via OPU2 (or
        OPU3) and then mapped into the corresponding OTU2 (or OTU3).
        Because a single ODUflex multiplexed signal is requested (Signal
        Type = 19), the downstream node has to return some labels (i.e.,
        the number of labels is NMC), which can take, for instance, the
        following values:

       - t4=0, t3=0, t2=27, t1=0;
         indicates the ODUflex in the 2nd 2.5G TS of the ODTUG2

         or

       - t4=0, t3=215, t2=0, t1=0;
         indicates the ODUflex in the 12nd 2.5G TS of the ODTUG3

6.  Interworking Considerations

   Equipment supporting a 1.25G TS structure for OPU2 or OPU3 must be
   backward compatible with equipment which supports only the 2.5G TS
   structure.  There must be some considerations on interworking between
   pre-G.709 and new OTN equipment.  Following figure is a interworking
   example between pre-G.709 and G.709 Amendment3.

        Figure 2: Interworking Scenario between pre-G.709 and G.709
                                Amendment3

   Interworking can probably be accomplished by requiring the new
   equipment to support the pre-G.709 payload mappings onto link that
   are attached to another equipment.  One approach that may satisfy
   this is to represent the capacity of a link in terms of the number of
   timeslots and the time slot bandwidth.  This can be reflected in the
   Interface Switching Capability Descriptor.  In the this scenario,
   node DXC2, DXC4 and DXC5 should have the interworking capability.

   With the introduction of many new Lower Order ODU bit rates, TE links
   should be represented by means of either their bandwidth or their
   number of tributary slots, the bandwidth per tributary slot and the
   set of client ODU signals supported.  Traffic Engineering Database
   (TED) should be compose of the following TE link for this scenario.


                  Max LSP Bandwidth  Minimum LSP Bandwidth
   OTU2(DXC1-DXC2)     ODU2 (10G)       ODU1 (2.5G)
   OTU2(DXC5-DXC6)     ODU2 (10G)       ODU0 (1.25G)
   OTU3(DXC2-DXC3)     ODU3 (40G)       ODU1 (1.25G)
   OTU3(DXC4-DXC5)     ODU3 (40G)       ODU1 (2.5G)
   OTU4(DXC3-DXC4)     ODU4 (100G)      ODU0 (1.25G)

   When we need to setup a ODU1 (2.5G) LSP between DXC1 node and DXC6
   nodes, the path computation entiy may computate an DXC1-DXC2-DXC3-
   DXC4-DXC5-DXC6 route by the ODU1 bandwidth request in an G.709
   network.

       connection must be based on the section "Backward Compatibility

   2.  The end-to-end connection also can be setuped with multiple
       segment session (i.e., ODU1 LSP1, ODU1 LSP2, ODU1 LSP3, ODU1
       LSP4).

                          Figure 4: Stitching TE LSP

       Druing setup of each segment lsp, tributary slot size should be
       known to control plane.  One approach that may satisfy this is
       based on the Signal Type in Traffic Parameters.  Signal Type and
       NMC in each segment LSP don't need to be changed any more.
       Following is the value of Signal Type for different segment LSP.


              Value     Type
   ODU1 LSP1  1         ODU1 (i.e., 2.5 Gbps is not further sub-divided)
   ODU1 LSP2  11        ODU1 /*The size of OPUk TS is 1.25G*/
   ODU1 LSP3  1         ODU1 (i.e., 2.5 Gbps is not further sub-divided)
   ODU1 LSP4  11        ODU1 /*The size of OPUk TS is 1.25G*/

       editor note: If the segment LSP can be created and prepaired for
       stitching by signaling, the end-to-end connection is stitched to
       several segment LSPs (i.e., ODU1 LSP1, ODU1 LSP2, ODU1 LSP3, ODU1
       LSP4).  The traffic parameters of this end-to-end session is TBD.
