Internet-Draft     Tuning the Behavior of IGMP and MLD         July 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) [2] for IPv4 and the
   Multicast Listener Discovery Protocol (MLD) [3] for IPv6 are the
   standard protocols for hosts to initiate joining or leaving multicast
   sessions.  These protocols must be also supported by multicast
   routers or IGMP/MLD proxies [11] that maintain multicast membership
   information on their downstream interfaces.  Conceptually, IGMP and
   MLD work on wireless networks.  However, wireless access technologies
   operate on a shared medium or a point-to-point link with limited
   frequency and bandwidth.  In many wireless regimes, it is desirable
   to minimize multicast-related signaling to preserve the limited
   resources of battery powered mobile devices and the constrained
   transmission capacities of the networks.  A mobile host may cause
   initiation and termination of a multicast service in the new or the
   previous network upon its movement.  Slow multicast service
   activation following a join may degrade reception quality.  Slow
   service termination triggered by IGMP/MLD querying or by a rapid
   departure of the mobile host without leaving the group in the
   previous network may waste network resources.

   To create the optimal multicast membership management condition, IGMP
   and MLD protocols could be tuned to "ease a mobile host's processing
   cost or battery power consumption by IGMP/MLD Query transmission
   timing coordination by routers" and "realize fast state convergence
   by successive monitoring whether downstream members exist or not".

   This document describes the ways of tuning the IGMPv3 and MLDv2
   protocol behavior for mobility, including a query and other timers
   tuning.  The selective optimization that provides tangible benefits
   to the mobile hosts and routers is given by "keeping track of
   downstream hosts' membership status" and "varying IGMP/MLD Query
   types and values to tune the number of responses".  A source
   filtering mechanism in a lightweight manner is also described for
   enabling Source-Specific Multicast.  The proposed behavior
   interoperates with the IGMPv3 and MLDv2 protocols.

3.  Explicit Tracking of Membership Status

3.1.  Advantages

   Mobile hosts use IGMP and MLD to request to join or leave multicast
   sessions.  When the adjacent upstream routers receive the IGMP/MLD
   Report messages, they recognize the membership status on the link.
   To update the membership status, the routers send IGMP/MLD Query
   messages periodically as a soft-state approach does, and the member
   hosts reply IGMP/MLD Report messages upon reception.

   IGMP/MLD Query is therefore necessary to obtain the up-to-date
   membership information, but a large number of the reply messages sent
   from all member hosts may cause network congestion or consume network
   bandwidth.  The traditional IGMP and MLD [5][6][7] provide a
   membership report suppression mechanism to escape from the network
   congestion.  The report suppression mechanism enables a host to
   cancel sending a pending membership report requested by IGMP/MLD
   Query if it observes the report that includes the same membership
   information on the network.  However, the report suppression
   mechanism precludes the function for an upstream router to track
   membership status.  Hence the membership report suppression mechanism
   has been removed from IGMPv3 [2] and MLDv2 [3], and all downstream
   member hosts must send their membership reports to an upstream
   router.

   The "explicit tracking function" is the possible approach to create
   the optimal condition for mobile communications.  It enables the
   router to keep track of the membership status of the downstream
   IGMPv3 or MLDv2 member hosts.

   Routers that enable the explicit tracking function can unicast IGMP/
   MLD General Query messages.  (The possibility of unicast General
   Query is described in Section 4.)  This is beneficial especially to
   mobile hosts that do not have enough battery power, since flooding
   IGMP/MLD messages on a wireless link makes all multicast members pay
   attention the messages and induces power consumption to the member
   hosts.  This also allows the upstream router to proceed fast leaves
   by tuning [Query Interval] value, because the router can immediately
   converge and update the membership information, ideally.  (Section 4
   details the point and Section 6 show the potential timer value.)

   This document therefore recommends to enable the explicit tracking
   function on adjacent upstream multicast routers.  However, this
   function requires router resources and does not completely eliminate
   the query-and-report communication between a router and host.
   Details are described in the following sections.

3.2.  Considerations

   Even with the explicit tracking function, routers need to maintain
   downstream membership status by sending IGMPv3/MLDv2 Query messages
   because of the following reasons.

   o  IGMP/MLD messages are non-reliable and may be lost in the
      transmission, therefore routers need to confirm the membership by
      sending Query messages.

   o  To preserve compatibility with older versions of IGMP/MLD, routers
      need to support downstream hosts that are not upgraded to the
      latest versions of IGMP/MLD and run the report suppression
      mechanism.

   o  It is impossible to identify mobile hosts when hosts have the
      unspecified address (::) or the same IPv6 link-local address.

   Regarding the last bullet, the IGMPv3 specification [2] mentions that
   an IGMPv3 Report is usually sent with a valid IP source address,
   although it permits that a host uses the 0.0.0.0 source address (as
   it happens that the host has not yet acquired an IP address), and
   routers MUST accept a report with a source address of 0.0.0.0.  The
   MLDv2 specification [3] mentions that an MLDv2 Report MUST be sent
   with a valid IPv6 link-local source address, although an MLDv2 Report
   can be sent with the unspecified address (::), if the sending
   interface has not acquired a valid link-local address yet.  However,
   routers MUST silently discard a message that is not sent with a valid
   link-local address or sent with the unspecified address, without
   taking any action, because of the security consideration.

   Another concern is that the explicit tracking function requires
   additional processing capability and a possibly large memory for
   routers to keep all membership status.  Especially when a router
   needs to maintail a large number of receiver hosts, this resource
   requirement may be potentially-impacted.  Operators may decide to
   disable this function when their routers do not have enough
   resources.

4.  IGMP/MLD Query Processing

   IGMP and MLD are non-reliable protocols; to cover the possibility of
   a State-Change Report being missed by one or more multicast routers,
   a host retransmits the same State-Change Report [Robustness Variable]
   - 1 more times, at intervals chosen at random from the range (0,
   [Unsolicited Report Interval]) [2][3].  However, this manner does not
   guarantee that the State-Change Report is reached to the routers.
   The routers still need to refresh the downstream membership
   information by receiving Current-State Report periodically solicited
   by IGMP/MLD General Query, in order to be robust in front of host or
   link failures and packet loss.  It supports the situation that mobile
   hosts turn off or move from the wireless network to other wireless
   network managed by the different router without any notification
   (e.g., leave request).

   A multicast router periodically transmits IGMP/MLD General Query in
   the [Query Interval] sec., whose default value is 125 seconds [2][3].
   In general, the all-hosts multicast address (224.0.0.1) or link-scope
   all-nodes multicast address (FF02::1) is used as the IP destination
   address of IGMP/MLD General Query.  Unfortunately, flooding
   periodical message whose destination address is the all-hosts/
   all-nodes multicast address consumes bettery power of mobile hosts.
   Only the active hosts that have been receiving multicast contents
   should respond the Query message.

   IGMPv3 and MLDv2 specifications [2][3] describe that a host MUST
   accept and process any Query whose IP Destination Address field
   contains any of the addresses (unicast or multicast) assigned to the
   interface on which the Query arrives.  According to the scenario, a
   router can unicast General Query to tracked member hosts in [Query
   Interval] (or [Unicast Query Interval] newly defined in [9]), if the
   router keeps track of membership information (Section 3).  Unicasting
   IGMP/MLD General Query would be effective especially when a wireless
   link is heavily loaded.

   If a multicast router attached to a wireless link enables an explicit
   tracking function and unicasts IGMP/MLD General Query for each member
   host, the General Query messages do not affect resources of non-
   member hosts.  And since the router recognizes the (mostly) actual
   member hosts, whether IGMP/MLD General Query messages are transmitted
   by unicast or multicast, the router can configure longer [Query
   Interval] value and send IGMP/MLD Group-Specific and Group-and-Source
   Specific Queries when it recognizes the last member has left from the
   network.  This will reduce the number of both IGMP/MLD General Query
   and Current-State Report messages.

   Note that longer query interval may increase join latency and leave

   latency when an unsolicited message with State-Change Record is not
   reached to the router.

   There is another concern in unicast General Query.  If a multicast
   router sends General Query "only" by unicast, it cannot discover
   potential member hosts whose join requests were lost.  Since the
   hosts do not send the same join requests (i.e., unsolicited Report
   messages) again, they loose the chance to join the channels unless
   the upstream router asks the membership information by sending
   General Query by multicast.  It will be solved by using both unicast
   and multicast General Queries and configuring the [Query Interval]
   timer value for multicast General Query and the [Unicast Query
   Interval] timer value for unicast General Query as proposed by [9],
   whereas it will require the protocol extension this document does not
   focus on.

   IGMP/MLD Group-Specific and Group-and-Source Specific Queries defined
   in [2][3] are sent to verify whether there are hosts that desire
   reception of the specified group or a set of sources or to rebuild
   the desired reception state for a particular group or a set of
   sources.  These specific Queries build and refresh multicast
   membership state of hosts on an attached network.  These specific
   Queries should be sent to each corresponding multicast address (not
   the all-hosts/all-nodes multicast address) as their IP destination
   addresses, because hosts that do not join the multicast session do
   not pay attention these specific Queries, and only active member
   hosts that have been receiving multicast contents with the specified
   address reply IGMP/MLD reports.

5.  Interoperability

   IGMPv3 [2] and MLDv2 [3] provide the ability for hosts to report
   source-specific subscriptions.  With IGMPv3/MLDv2, a mobile host can
   specify a channel of interest, using multicast group and source
   addresses in its join request.  Upon its reception, the upstream
   router that supports IGMPv3/MLDv2 establishes the shortest path tree
   toward the source without coordinating a shared tree.  This function
   is called the source filtering function and required to support
   Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) [8].

   Recently, the Lightweight-IGMPv3 (LW-IGMPv3) and Lightweight-MLDv2
   (LW-MLDv2) [4] protocols have been proposed in the IETF.  These
   protocols provide protocol simplicity for mobile hosts and routers,
   as they eliminate a complex state machine from the full versions of
   IGMPv3 and MLDv2, and promote the opportunity to implement SSM in
   mobile communications.

   This document assumes multicast routers that deal with mobile hosts
   and mobile hosts MUST be IGMPv3/MLDv2 capable, regardless whether the
   protocols are the full or lightweight version.  Therefore all
   interoperability conditions are inherited from [2][3][4].  This
   document does not consider interoperability with older version
   protocols.

6.  Timers, Counters, and Their Default Values

   The [Query Interval] is the interval between General Queries sent by
   the regular IGMPv3/MLDv2 querier, and the default value is 125
   seconds [2][3].  By varying the [Query Interval], multicast routers
   can tune the number of IGMP messages on the network; larger values
   cause IGMP Queries to be sent less often.

   This document proposes to inherit the default [Query Interval] value,
   125 seconds, in case that a router enables the explicit tracking
   function and sends General Query to tracked member hosts by unicast.
   Nevertheless, the last-hop router may want to configure longer [Query
   Interval] value such as 150 seconds when operators expect the router
   will potentially maintains a large number of member hosts such as
   1000 hosts on the wireless link.

   This document also proposes 180 seconds for the [Query Interval]
   value in case that a router enables the explicit tracking function
   and sends General Query by multicast.  This longer value contributes
   to minimizing traffic of Report messages and battery power
   consumption for mobile hosts.  Multicast General Query is necessary
   to update membership information if it is not correctly synchronized
   due to missing Reports.

   The [Query Response Interval] is the Max Response Time (or Max
   Response Delay) used to calculate the Max Resp Code inserted into the
   periodic General Queries.  Its default value is 10 seconds expressed
   by "100" for IGMPv3 [2] and "10000" for [3].  By varying the [Query
   Response Interval], multicast routers can tune the burstiness of
   IGMP/MLD messages on the network; larger values make the traffic less
   bursty as host responses are spread out over a larger interval, but
   will increase join latency when State-Change Report is missing.

   This document proposes 5 seconds (expressed by "50" for IGMPv3 and
   "5000" for MLDv2) for the [Query Response Interval] value in case
   that a router enables the explicit tracking function and sends
   General Query by unicast.  This shorter value introduces quick
   response, which is valuable for the use of unicast General Query.
   Note that the shorter [Query Response Interval] value may cause
   sudden increase in a traffic especially when a large number of member
   hosts attaches on the network; therefore it SHOULD NOT be 1 or
   smaller second.

   In case that a router multicasts General Query, the default [Query
   Response Interval] value, 10 seconds, can be reasonablly used.

   To cover the possibility of unsolicited reports being missed by
   multicast routers, unsolicited reports are retransmitted [Robustness

   Variable] - 1 more times, at intervals chosen at random from the
   defined range [2][3].  The QRV (Querier's Robustness Variable) field
   in IGMP/MLD Query contains the [Robustness Variable] value used by
   the querier.  Routers adopt the QRV value from the most recently
   received Query as their own [Robustness Variable] value, whose range
   SHOULD be set between "1" to "7".  The default [Robustness Variable]
   value defined in IGMPv3 [2] and MLDv2 [3] is "2".  This document
   proposes "2" for the [Robustness Variable] value for mobility.  And
   whether the explicit tracking function is enabled or not, the
   [Robustness Variable] value SHOULD NOT be bigger than "2".

   The [Startup Query Interval] is the interval between General Queries
   sent by a Querier on startup.  The default value is 1/4 of [Query
   Interval]; however, this document recommends the use of its
   shortended value such as 1 second since the shorter value would
   contribute to smooth handover for mobile hosts using e.g., PMIPv6
   [12].  Note that the [Startup Query Interval] is a static value and
   cannot be changed by any external signal.  Therefore operators who
   maintain routers and wireless links must properly configure this
   value.
