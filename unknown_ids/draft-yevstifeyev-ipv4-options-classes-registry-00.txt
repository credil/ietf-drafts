INTERNET DRAFT     Registry for IPv4 Options Classes   November 10, 2010


1  Introduction

   This document creates an IANA registry for IPv4 options classes. At
   the moment if somebody wants to create a new class for IPv4 options,
   they should make the document, which updates a RFC 791 [1]. The
   registry, created by this document, allows them to assign a new class
   of IPv4 options by editing it.

   IPv4 refers to Internet Protocol defined in RFC 791 [1]

2  Motivation and Overview

   Making a registry for IPv4 options classes will allow developers to
   assign the options classes without changes or updates to RFC 791 [1].

   Any options classes for IPv4 will be assigned by IANA. Assigning such
   options classes will be made by changing the registry for options
   classes.

3  Security Considerations

   This memo does not define any protocol, and raises no security
   issues.


4  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to create a registry for IPv4 options classes named
   "IPv4 Options Classes Registry". The registry consists of 2 fields -
   number and description. Initial values for the IPv4 registry are
   given below (see also RFC 791 [1]); future assignments are to be made
   through Expert Review. RFC is requires to assign a value to this
   registry.

     Value | Description   
   --------+--------------------------
       0   | Control
       1   | Reserved
       2   | Debugging and Measurement
       3   | Reserved
