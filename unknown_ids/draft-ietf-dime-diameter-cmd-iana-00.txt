Internet-Draft   Diameter Command Code Allocation Policy       June 2009


Abstract

   The Diameter Base specification, described in RFC 3588, provides a
   number of ways to extend Diameter, with new Diameter commands, i.e.
   messages used by Diameter applications, and applications as the most
   extensive enhancements.  RFC 3588 illustrates the conditions that
   lead to the need to define a new Diameter application or a new
   command code.  Depending on the scope of the Diameter extension IETF
   actions are necessary.  Although defining new Diameter applications
   does not require IETF consensus, defining new Diameter commands
   requires IETF consensus per RFC 3588.  This has lead to questionable
   design decisions by other Standards Development Organizations which
   chose to define new applications on existing commands rather than
   asking for assignment of new command codes for the pure purpose of
   avoiding bringing their specifications to the IETF.  In some cases
   interoperability problems were causes as an effect of the poor design
   caused by overloading existing commands.

   This document aligns the extensibility rules of Diameter application
   with the Diameter commands offering ways to delegate work on Diameter
   to other SDOs to extend Diameter in a way that does not lead to poor
   design choices.

Internet-Draft   Diameter Command Code Allocation Policy       June 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Diameter Base specification, described in RFC 3588 [RFC3588],
   provides a number of ways to extend Diameter, with new Diameter
   commands, i.e. messages used by Diameter applications, and
   applications as the most extensive enhancements.  RFC 3588
   illustrates the conditions that lead to the need to define a new
   Diameter application or a new command code.  Depending on the scope
   of the Diameter extension IETF actions are necessary.  Although
   defining new Diameter applications does not require IETF consensus,
   defining new Diameter commands requires IETF consensus per RFC 3588.
   This has lead to questionable design decisions by other Standards
   Development Organizations which chose to define new applications on
   existing commands rather than asking for assignment of new command
   codes for the pure purpose of avoiding bringing their specifications
   to the IETF.  In some cases interoperability problems were causes as
   an effect of the poor design caused by overloading existing commands.

   This document aligns the extensibility rules of Diameter application
   with the Diameter commands offering ways to delegate work on Diameter
   to other SDOs to extend Diameter in a way that does not lead to poor
   design choices.

   This is achieved by splitting the command code space into an IANA
   administered code space, and a vendors-specific code space with
   different rules of allocation as per [RFC5226].

   A revision of RFC 3588 is currently in development in the IETF DIME
   WG [I-D.ietf-dime-rfc3588bis]. and when approved will obsolete RFC
   3588 as well as this document.  This document has as a goal providing
   in advance the change in the command codes allocation policy, so that
   interoperability problems as the ones described above are avoided as
   soon as possible.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Security Considerations

   This document modifies the IANA allocation of Diameter Command Codes
   in relationship to RFC 3588.  This process change itself does not
   raise security concerns, but the command codes space is split into a
   standards commands space and a vendor-specific command codes space,
   the later being allocated on a First Come, First Served basis by IANA
   at the request of vendors or other standards organizations.  Whenever
   work gets delegated to organizations outside the IETF there is always
   the chance that fewer security reviews are conducted and hence the
   quality of the resulting protocol document is weaker compared to the
   rather extensive reviews performed in the IETF.  The members of the
   DIME working group are aware of the tradeoff between better
   specification quality and the desire to offload work (e.g., to reduce
   the workload in the IETF) to other organizations.  Other
   organizations are therefore made responsible for the quality of the
   specifications they produce.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This section describes changes to the IANA consideration sections
   outlined in RFC 3588 regarding the allocation of Command Codes by
   IANA.

   The Command Code namespace is used to identify Diameter commands.
   The values 0-255 (0x00-0xff) are reserved for RADIUS backward
   compatibility, and are defined as "RADIUS Packet Type Codes" in
   [RADTYPE].  Values 256 - 8,388,607 (0x100 to 0x7fffff) are for
   permanent, standard commands, allocated by IETF Review [RFC5226].
   [RFC3588] defines the Command Codes 257, 258, 271, 274-275, 280 and
   282.  See Section 3.1 in [RFC3588] for the assignment of the
   namespace in this specification.

   The values 8,388,608 - 16,777,213 (0x800000 - 0xfffffd) are reserved
   for vendor-specific command codes, to be allocated on a First Come,
   First Served basis by IANA [RFC5226].  The request to IANA for a
   Vendor-Specific Command Code SHOULD include a reference to a publicly
   available specification which documents the command in sufficient
   detail to aid in interoperability between independent
   implementations.  If the specification cannot be made publicly
   available, the request for a vendor-specific command code MUST
   include the contact information of persons and/or entities
   responsible for authoring and maintaining the command.

   The values 16,777,214 and 16,777,215 (hexadecimal values 0xfffffe -
   0xffffff) are reserved for experimental commands.  As these codes are
   only for experimental and testing purposes, no guarantee is made for
   interoperability between Diameter peers using experimental commands,
   as outlined in [RFC3692].

5.  Acknowledgements

   The content of this document is the result of the work in the IETF
   Diameter Maintenance and Extensions (dime) working group.  We would
   therefore like to thank all the working group members who were
   involved in that discussion.  While it appears to be a fairly small
   change in the allocation policy the effect on implementations is
   rather dramatic.
