Internet-Draft            Email Greylisting BCP             January 2012


1.  Introduction

   There are many techniques in use for dealing with email abuse.  One
   is a set of techniques known as "greylisting".  Broadly, this refers
   to any degradation of service for an unknown or suspect source, over
   a period of time.  The narrow use of the term refers to generation of
   an SMTP temporary failure reply code for traffic from such sources.

   There are diverse implementations of this general technique, and,
   predictably therefore, some blurred terminology.

   This memo documents common greylisting techniques and discusses their
   benefits and costs.  It also defines terminology to enable clear
   distinction and discussion of these techniques.

2.  Definitions

2.1.  Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

2.2.  E-Mail Architecture Terminology

   Readers should be familiar with the material and terminology
   discussed in [MAIL] and [EMAIL-ARCH].

3.  Background

   For many years, large amounts of spam have been sent through purpose-
   built software, or "spamware", rather than conventional Mail Transfer
   Agents (MTAs).  If recipient hosts can identify distinctive
   characteristics of spamware that differ from legitimate MTAs, the
   recipient hosts can reject mail from spamware during the SMTP
   session, avoiding the need to receive the spam.

   Spamware consistently does little or no error recovery.  If it can't
   deliver a message, it just goes on since, in spamming, volume counts
   for far more than reliability.  Greylisting tries to detect spamware
   by rejecting mail from unfamiliar sources with a "soft fail" (4xx)
   [SMTP] error code, on the theory that standard MTAs will retry, and
   spamware won't.  Another, less well-developed, application of
   greylisting is to delay mail from newly seen IP addresses on the
   theory that, if it's a spam source, then by the time it retries, it
   will appear in a list of sources to be filtered, and the mail will
   not be accepted.

4.  Connection-Level Greylisting

   Connection-level greylisting involves deciding whether to accept the
   connection from a new [SMTP] client.  At this point in the
   communication between the client and the server, the only information
   known is the incoming IP address.  This, of course, is often (but not
   always) translatable into a host name.

   The typical application of greylisting here is to keep a record of
   SMTP client IP addresses and/or host names (collectively, "sources")
   that have been seen.  Such a database may or may not expire records
   after some period.  If the source is not in the database, or the
   record of the source has not reached some required minimum age, the
   server does one of the following, inviting a later retry:

   o  returns a 421 SMTP reply, and closes the connection;

   o  returns a different 4yz SMTP reply to all further commands in this
      SMTP session

5.  SMTP HELO/EHLO Greylisting

   HELO/EHLO greylisting refers to the first [SMTP] command verb in an
   SMTP session.  It includes a single, required parameter that is
   supposed to contain the client's fully-qualified host name or its
   literal IP address.

   Greylisting implemented at this phase involves retaining a record of
   sources coupled with HELO/EHLO parameters, and returning 4yz SMTP
   replies to all commands until the end of the SMTP session if that
   tuple has not previously been recorded or if the record exists but
   has not reached some configured minimum age.

6.  SMTP MAIL Greylisting

   MAIL greylisting refers to the [SMTP] command verb in an SMTP session
   that initiates a new transaction.  It includes at least one required
   parameter that indicates the return email address of the message
   being relayed from the client to the server.

   Greylisting implemented at this phase involves retaining a record of
   sources coupled with return email addresses, and returning 4yz SMTP
   replies to all commands for the remainder of the SMTP session if that
   tuple has not previously been recorded or if the record exists but
   has not met some configured minimum age.

7.  SMTP RCPT Greylisting

   RCPT greylisting refers to the [SMTP] command verb in an SMTP session
   that specifies intended recipients of an email transaction.  It
   includes at least one required parameter that indicates the email
   address of an intended recipient of the message being relayed from
   the client to the server.

   Greylisting implemented at this phase involves retaining a record of
   tuples that combine the provided recipient address with any
   combination of the following:

   o  the source, as described above;

   o  the return email address;

   o  other recipients of the message

   If the selected tuple is not found in the database, or if the record
   is present but has not reached some configured minimum age, the
   greylisting MTA returns 4yz SMTP replies to all commands for the
   remainder of the SMTP session.

8.  SMTP DATA Greylisting

   DATA greylisting refers to the [SMTP] command verb in an SMTP session
   that contains the actual message content as opposed to its envelope
   details (see [MAIL]).

   Some implementations do filtering here because there are clients that
   don't bother checking SMTP reply codes to commands other than DATA.

   Numerous implementations of greylisting are possible at this point.
   All of them involve retaining a record of tuples that combine the
   various parts of the SMTP transaction in some combination, including:

   o  the source, as described above;

   o  the return email address;

   o  the recipients of the message, as a set or individually;

   o  identifiers in the message, such as the contents of the
      RFC5322.From or RFC5322.To fields;

   o  other prominent parts of the content, such as the RFC5322.Subject
      field;

Internet-Draft            Email Greylisting BCP             January 2012


   o  a digest of some or all of the message content, as a test for
      uniqueness;

   If the selected tuple is not found in the database, or if the record
   exists but has not reached some configured minimum age, the
   greylisting MTA returns 4yz SMTP replies to all commands for the
   remainder of the SMTP session.

9.  Exceptions

   Most greylisting systems provide for an exception mechanism, allowing
   one to specify IP addresses, CIDR blocks, hostnames or domain names
   that are exempt from greylisting checks and thus whose SMTP client
   sessions are not subject to such interference.

10.  Benefits and Costs

   The most obvious benefit to any of the above techniques is that
   spamware deliveries, since they don't retry, are less likely to
   succeed as they are unlikely to make an attempt when a record of a
   previous delivery attempt has been made.

   The most obvious detriment to implementing greylisting is the
   imposition of delay on legitimate mail.  Some popular MTAs don't
   retry failed delivery attempts for an hour or more, which can cause
   expensive delays when delivery of mail is timely.  The
   counterargument to this is that email has always been a "best-effort"
   mechanism, and thus this cost is ultimately low in comparison to the
   cost of dealing with high volumes of unwanted mail.

   Another obvious cost is the database needed.  It has to be large
   enough to keep enough history to do an effective job, and fast enough
   to avoid introducing delay into the delivery.  The primary
   consideration is the maximum age of records in the database.  If
   records age out too soon, then hosts that do retry per [SMTP] will be
   periodically subjected to greylisting even though they are well-
   behaved; if records age out after too long a period, then eventually
   spamware that launches a new campaign will not be identified as
   "unknown" in this manner, and will not be required to retry.

11.  Unintended Effects On Deliveries

   There are a few failure modes worth considering.  For example,
   consider an email message intended for user@example.com.  The
   example.com domain is served by two mail servers, one called
   mail1.example.com and one called mail2.example.com.  On the first
   delivery attempt, mail1.example.com greylists the client, and thus
   the client places the message in its outgoing queue for later retry.



Kucherawy                 Expires July 23, 2012                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft            Email Greylisting BCP             January 2012


   Later, when a retry is attempted, mail2.example.com is selected for
   the delivery, either because mail1.example.com is unavailable or
   because a round-robin [DNS] evaluation produced that result.
   However, the two example.com hosts do not share greylisting
   databases, so the second host again denies the attempt.  Thus,
   although example.com has sought to improve its email throughput, it
   has in fact amplified the problem of legitimate mail delay introduced
   by greylisting.

   Similarly, consider a site with multiple outbound MTAs that share a
   common queue.  On a first outbound delivery attempt to example.com,
   the attempt is greylisted.  On a later retry, a different outbound
   MTA is selected, which means example.com sees a different source, and
   once again greylisting occurs on the same message.

   For systems that do DATA-level greylisting, if any part of the
   message has changed since the first attempt, the tuple constructed
   might be different than the one for the first attempt, and the
   delivery is again greylisted.

   All of these and other similar cases can cause greylisting to be
   applied inproperly to legitimate MTAs multiple times, leading to long
   delays in delivery or ultimately the return of the message to its
   sender.  Other side effects include out-of-order delivery of related,
   sequenced messages.

12.  Unintended Effects On Clients

   Atypical client behaviours also need to be considered when deploying
   greylisting.

   Some clients do not retry messages for very long periods.  Popular
   open source MTAs implement increasing backoff times when messages
   receive temporary failure messages, and/or degrade queue priority for
   very large messages.  This means greylisting introduces even more
   delay for MTAs implementing such schemes, and the delay can become
   large enough to become a nuisance to users.

   Some clients do not retry messages at all.  This means greylisting
   will cause outright delivery failure right away for sources,
   envelopes, or messages that it has not seen before, regardless of the
   client attempting the delivery, essentially treating legitimate mail
   and spam the same.

   If a greylisting scheme requires a database record to have reached a
   certain age rather than merely testing for the presence of the record
   in the database, and the client has a retry schedule that is too
   aggressive, the client could be subjected to rate limiting by the MTA

Internet-Draft            Email Greylisting BCP             January 2012


   independent of the restrictions imposed by greylisting.

   There exist SMTP implementations that make the error of treating all
   error codes as fatal; that is, a 4yz [SMTP] response is treated as if
   it was a 5yz response, and the message is returned to the sender as
   undeliverable.

   Some clients encode message-specific details in the address parameter
   to the [SMTP] MAIL command.  If doing so causes the parameter to
   change between retry attempts, a greylisting implementation could see
   it as a new delivery rather than a retry, and disallow the delivery.
   In such cases, the mail will never be delivered, and will be returned
   to the sender after the retry timeout expires.

13.  Recommendations

   This section will provide some general recommendations about when and
   how to deploy greylisting in various conceptual environments.

   Some points to discuss:

   o  logging of a greylisting server vs. one not greylisting can be a
      good measure of how effective it is

   o  can also compare greylisting results to DNSBLs and content
      filtering

   o  greylisting is more expensive than not greylisting

   o  time limits for greylisting

   o  special actions to take if the same message is retried before the
      time limit expires

   o  recommended termination methods (421 vs. 4xx)

   o  affects/requirements on MXes other than the lowest

   o  ability to share information between servers

14.  IANA Considerations

   No actions are requested of IANA in this memo.

15.  Security Considerations

   This section discusses potential security issues related to
   greylisting.

15.1.  Exceptions

   The discussion above highlights the fact that, although greylisting
   provides some obvious and valuable defenses, it can introduce
   unintentional but detrimental consequences to email delivery.  Where
   timely delivery of email is essential, especially for security-
   related applications, the possible consequences of such systems need
   to be carefully considered.

   Specific sources can be excepted from greylisting, but of course that
   means they have elevated privilege in terms of access to the
   mailboxes on the greylisting system, and malefactors may seek to
   exploit this.

15.2.  Database

   The database that has to be maintained as part of any greylisting
   system will grow as the diversity of its SMTP clients grows, and of
   course is larger in general depending on the nature of the tuple
   stored about each delivery attempt.  Even with a record aging policy
   in place, such a database can grow large enough to interfere with the
   system hosting it, or at least to a point where greylisting service
   is degraded.  Moreover, an attacker knowing which greylisting scheme
   is in use could rotate parameters of SMTP clients under its control
   in an attempt to inflate the database to the point of denial-of-
   service.

   Implementers could consider configuring an appropriate failure policy
   so that something locally acceptable happens when the database is
   attacked or otherwise unavailable.
