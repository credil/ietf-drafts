Abstract 
    
   An Emergency Telecommunications Service (ETS) requires the ability to 
   provide an elevated probability of session establishment to an 
   authorized user in times of network congestion (typically, during a 
   crisis). When supported over the Internet Protocol suite, this may be 
   facilitated through a network layer admission control solution, which 
   supports prioritized access to resources (e.g., bandwidth). These 
   resources may be explicitly set aside for emergency services, or they 
   may be shared with other sessions.

1.  Introduction 
    
   [EMERG-RQTS] and [EMERG-TEL] detail requirements for an Emergency 
   Telecommunications Service (ETS), which is an umbrella term 
   identifying those networks and specific services used to support 
   emergency communications. An underlying goal of these documents is to 
   present requirements that elevate the probability of session 
   establishment from an authorized user in times of network congestion 
   (presumably because of a crisis condition). In some extreme cases, 
   the requirement for this probability may reach 100%, but that is a 
   topic subject to policy and most likely local regulation (the latter 
   being outside the scope of this document). 
    
   Solutions to meet this requirement for elevated session establishment 
   probability may involve session layer capabilities prioritizing 
   access to resources controlled by the session control function. As an 
   example, entities involved in session control (such as SIP user 
   agents, when the Session Initiation Protocol, SIP [SIP], is the 
   session control protocol in use) can influence their treatment of 
   session establishment requests (such as SIP requests). This may 
   include the ability to "queue" call requests when those can not be 
   immediately honored (in some cases with the notion of "bumping", or 
   "displacement", of less important call request from that queue). It 
   may include additional mechanisms such as exemption from certain 
   network management controls, and alternate routing. 
    
   Solutions to meet the requirement for elevated session establishment 
   probability may also take advantage of network layer admission 
   control mechanisms supporting admission priority. Networks usually 
   have engineered capacity limits that characterize the maximum load 
   that can be handled (say, on any given link) for a class of traffic 
   while satisfying the quality of service requirements of that traffic 
   class. Admission priority may involve setting aside some network 
   resources (e.g. bandwidth) out of the engineered capacity limits for 
   the emergency services only. Or alternatively, it may involve 
   allowing the emergency related sessions to seize additional resources 
   beyond the engineered capacity limits applied to normal calls. 
    
   Note: Below, this document references several examples of IP 
   telephony and its use of "calls", which is one form of the term 
   "sessions" (Video over IP and Instant Messaging being other examples 
   that rely on session establishment). For the sake of simplicity, we 
   shall use the widely known term "call" for the remainder of this 
   document. 
    
1.1. Related Technical Documents 
    
   [EMERG-IMP] is patterned after [ITU.I.225] and describes an example 
   of one type of prioritized network layer admission control procedure 
 
 
Le Faucheur, et al.                                           [Page 3] 
                RSVP Extensions for Emergency Services    January 2008 
 
 
   that may be used for emergency services operating over an IP network 
   infrastructure. It discusses initial call set up, as well as 
   operations after call establishment through maintenance of a 
   continuing call model of the status of all calls. [EMERG-IMP] also 
   describes how these network layer admission control procedures can be 
   realized using the Resource reSerVation Protocol [RSVP] along with 
   its associated protocol suite and extensions, including those for 
   policy based admission control ([FW-POLICY], [RSVP-POLICY]), for user 
   authentication and authorization ([RSVP-ID]) and for integrity and 
   authentication of RSVP messages ([RSVP-CRYPTO-1], [RSVP-CRYPTO-2]). 
    
   Furthermore, [EMERG-IMP] describes how the RSVP Signaled Preemption 
   Priority Policy Element specified in [RSVP-PREEMP] can be used to 
   enforce the call preemption that may be needed by some emergency 
   services. 
    
   In contrast to [EMERG-IMP], this document specifies new RSVP 
   extensions to increase the probability of call completion without 
   preemption. Engineered capacity techniques in the form of bandwidth 
   allocation models are used to satisfy the "admission priority" 
   required by an RSVP capable ETS network. In particular this document 
   specifies two new RSVP Policy Elements allowing the admission 
   priority to be conveyed inside RSVP signaling messages so that RSVP 
   nodes can enforce selective bandwidth admission control decision 
   based on the call admission priority. Appendix A of this document 
   also provides three examples of a bandwidth allocation model, which 
   can be used by RSVP-routers to enforce such admission priority on 
   every link. 
    
1.2. Terminology 
 
   This document assumes the terminology defined in [FW-POLICY]. For 
   convenience, the definition of a few key terms is repeated here: 
    
   - Policy Decision Point (PDP): The point where policy decisions are 
   made. 
    
   - Local Policy Decision Point (LPDP): PDP local to the network 
   element 
    
   - Policy Enforcement Point (PEP): The point where the policy 
   decisions are actually enforced. 
    
   - Policy Ignorant Node (PIN): A network element that does not 
   explicitly support policy control using the mechanisms defined in 
   [FW-POLICY].

2.  Overview of RSVP extensions and Operations 
    
   Let us consider the case where a call requiring ETS type service is 
   to be established, and more specifically that the preference to be 
   granted to this call is in terms of network layer "admission 
   priority" (as opposed to preference granted through preemption of 
   existing calls). By "admission priority" we mean allowing that 
   priority call to seize network layer resources from the engineered 
   capacity that have been set-aside and not made available to normal 
   calls, or alternatively by allowing that call to seize additional 
   resources beyond the engineered capacity limits applied to normal 
   calls.  
    
   As described in [EMERG-IMP], the session establishment can be 
   conditioned to resource-based and policy-based network layer 
   admission control achieved via RSVP signaling. In the case where the 
   session control protocol is SIP, the use of RSVP-based admission 
   control by SIP is specified in [SIP-RESOURCE]. 
    
   Devices involved in the session establishment are expected to be 
   aware of the application-level priority requirements of emergency 
   calls. Again considering the case where the session control protocol 
   is SIP, the SIP user agents can be made aware of the resource 
   priority requirements in the case of an emergency call using the 
   Resource-Priority Header mechanism specified in [SIP-PRIORITY]. The 
   end-devices involved in the upper-layer session establishment simply 
   need to copy the application-level resource priority requirements 
   (e.g. as communicated in SIP Resource-Priority Header) inside the new 
   RSVP Application-Level Resource-Priority Policy Element defined in 
   this document.  
    
   Conveying the application-level resource priority requirements inside 
   the RSVP message allows this application level requirement to be 
   mapped/remapped into a different RSVP "admission priority" at every 
   administrative domain boundary based on the policy applicable in that 
   domain. In a typical model (see [FW-POLICY]) where PDPs control PEPs 
   at the periphery of the policy domain (e.g., in border routers), PDPs 
   would interpret the RSVP Application-Level Resource-Priority Policy 
   Element and map the requirement of the emergency session into an RSVP 
   "admission priority" level. Then, PDPs would convey this information 
   inside the new Admission Priority Policy Element defined in this 
   document. This way, the RSVP admission priority can be communicated 
   to downstream PEPs (ie RSVP Routers) of the same policy domain, which 
   have LPDPs but no controlling PDP. In turn, this means the necessary 
   RSVP Admission priority can be enforced at every RSVP hop, including 
   all the (many) hops which do not have any understanding of 
   Application-Level Resource-Priority semantics.  
    

 
 
Le Faucheur, et al.                                           [Page 5] 
                RSVP Extensions for Emergency Services    January 2008 
 
 
   As an example of operation across multiple administrative domains, a 
   first domain might decide to provide network layer admission priority 
   to calls of a given Application Level Resource Priority and map it 
   into a high RSVP admission control priority inside the Admission 
   Priority Policy Element; while a second domain may decide to not 
   provide admission priority to calls of this same Application Level 
   Resource Priority and hence map it into a low RSVP admission control 
   priority.  
    
   As another example of operation across multiple administrative 
   domains, we can consider the case where the resource priority header 
   enumerates several namespaces, as explicitly allowed by [SIP-
   PRIORITY], for support of scenarios where calls traverse multiple 
   administrative domains using different namespace. In that case, the 
   relevant namespace can be used at each domain boundary to map into an 
   RSVP Admission priority for that domain. It is not expected that the 
   RSVP Application-Level Resource-Priority Header Policy Element would 
   be taken into account at RSVP-hops within a given administrative 
   domain. It is expected to be used at administrative domain boundaries 
   only in order to set/reset the RSVP Admission Priority Policy  
   Element. 
    
   The existence of pre-established inter-domain policy agreements or 
   Service Level Agreements may avoid the need to take real-time action 
   at administrative domain boundaries for mapping/remapping of 
   admission priorities.   
    
   Mapping/remapping by PDPs may also be applied to boundaries between 
   various signaling protocols, such as those advanced by the NSIS 
   working group. 
    
   As can be observed, the framework described above for 
   mapping/remapping application level resource priority requirements 
   into an RSVP admission priority can also be used together with [RSVP-
   PREEMP] for mapping/remapping application level resource priority 
   requirements into an RSVP preemption priority (when preemption is 
   indeed needed). In that case, when processing the RSVP Application-
   Level Resource-Priority Policy Element, the PDPs at boundaries 
   between administrative domains (or between various QoS signaling 
   protocols) can map it into an RSVP "preemption priority" information. 
   This Preemption priority information comprises a setup preemption 
   level and a defending preemption priority level. This preemption 
   priority information can then be encoded inside the Preemption 
   Priority Policy Element of [RSVP-PREEMP] and thus, can be taken into 
   account at every RSVP-enabled network hop as discussed [EMERG-IMP]. 
   Appendix B provides examples of various hypothetical policies for 
   emergency call handling, some of them involving admission priority, 
   some of them involving both admission priority and preemption 
   priority. Appendix B also identifies how the Application-Level 
 
 
Le Faucheur, et al.                                           [Page 6] 
                RSVP Extensions for Emergency Services    January 2008 
 
 
   Resource Priority need to be mapped into RSVP policy elements by the 
   PDPs to realize these policies. 
    
    
2.1.  Operations of Admission Priority  
    
   The RSVP Admission Priority policy element defined in this document 
   allows admission bandwidth to be allocated preferentially to an 
   authorized priority service. Multiple models of bandwidth allocation 
   MAY be used to that end.  
    
   A number of bandwidth allocation models have been defined in the IETF 
   for allocation of bandwidth across different classes of traffic 
   trunks in the context of Diffserv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering. 
   Those include the Maximum Allocation Model (MAM) defined in [DSTE-
   MAM] and the Russian Dolls Model (RDM) specified in [DSTE-RDM]. These 
   same models MAY however be applied for allocation of bandwidth across 
   different levels of admission priority as defined in this document.  
   Appendix A provides an illustration of how these bandwidth allocation 
   models can be applied for such purposes and introduces an additional 
   bandwidth allocation model that we term the Priority Bypass Model 
   (PrBM). It is important to note that the models described and 
   illustrated in Appendix A are only informative and do not represent a 
   recommended course of action. 
    
   We can see in these examples, that the RSVP Admission Priority may 
   effectively influence the fundamental admission control decision of 
   RSVP (for example by determining which bandwidth pool is to be used 
   by RSVP for performing its fundamental bandwidth allocation). In that 
   sense, we observe that the policy control and admission control are 
   not separate logics but instead somewhat blended. 
    
    
3.  New Policy Elements 
    
   The Framework document for policy-based admission control [FW-POLICY] 
   describes the various components that participate in policy decision 
   making (i.e., PDP, PEP and LPDP). 
    
   As described in section 2 of the present document, the Application-
   Level Resource Priority Policy Element and the Admission Priority 
   Policy Element serve different roles in this framework:  
    
      - the Application-Level Resource Priority Policy Element conveys 
        application level information and is processed by PDPs 
    
      - the emphasis of Admission Priority Policy Element is to be 
        simple, stateless, and light-weight such that it can be 
        processed internally within a node's LPDP. It can then be 
 
 
Le Faucheur, et al.                                           [Page 7] 
                RSVP Extensions for Emergency Services    January 2008 
 
 
        enforced internally within a node's PEP. It is set by PDPs 
        based on processing of the Application-Level Resource Priority 
        Policy Element. 
 
    
   [RSVP-POLICY] defines extensions for supporting generic policy based 
   admission control in RSVP. These extensions include the standard 
   format of POLICY_DATA objects and a description of RSVP handling of 
   policy events.  
    
   The POLICY_DATA object contains one or more of Policy Elements, each 
   representing a different (and perhaps orthogonal) policy. As an 
   example, [RSVP-PREEMP] specifies the Preemption Priority Policy 
   Element.  
    
   This document defines two new Policy Elements called: 
      - the Admission Priority Policy Element 
      - the Application-Level Resource Priority Policy Element 
    
3.1.  Admission Priority Policy Element 
    
   The format of the Admission Priority policy element is as follows: 
    
          0           0 0           1 1           2 2           3

   reception. 
    
   Adm. Priority (Admission Priority): 8 bits (unsigned) 
   The admission control priority of the flow, in terms of access to 
   network bandwidth in order to provide higher probability of call 
   completion to selected flows. Higher values represent higher  
   Priority. A given Admission Priority is encoded in this information 
   element using the same value as when encoded in the Admission 
   Priority parameter defined in section 6.2.9 of [NSIS-QSPEC], or in 
   the Admission Priority parameter defined in section 4.10 of [DIME-
   PARAM]. In other words, a given value inside the Admission Priority 
   information element defined in the present document, inside the 
   [NSIS-QSPEC] Admission Priority parameter or inside the [DIME-PARAM] 
   Admission Priority parameter, refers to the same Admission Priority. 
    
   Bandwidth allocation models such as those described in Appendix A are 
   to be used by the RSVP router to achieve such increased probability 
   of call completion. The admission priority value effectively 
   indicates which bandwidth constraint(s) of the bandwidth constraint 
   model in use is(are) applicable to admission of this RSVP  
   reservation. 
    
        
   Note that the Admission Priority Policy Element does NOT indicate 
   that this RSVP reservation is to preempt any other RSVP reservation. 
   If a priority session justifies both admission priority and 
   preemption priority, the corresponding RSVP reservation needs to 
   carry both an Admission Priority Policy Element and a Preemption 
   Priority Policy Element. The Admission Priority and Preemption 
   Priority are handled by LPDPs and PEPs as separate mechanisms. They 
   can be used one without the other, or they can be used both in 
   combination.  
    
3.1.1.        Admission Priority Merging Rules 
    
   This section discusses alternatives for dealing with RSVP admission 
   priority in case of merging of reservations. As merging is only 

 
 
Le Faucheur, et al.                                           [Page 9] 
                RSVP Extensions for Emergency Services    January 2008 
 
 
   applicable to multicast, this section also only applies to multicast 
   sessions. 
    
   The rules for merging Admission Priority Policy Elements are the same 
   as those defined in [RSVP-PREEMP] for merging Preemption Priority 
   Policy Elements. In particular, the following merging strategies are 
   supported: 
      - Take priority of highest QoS 
      - Take highest priority 
      - Force Error on heterogeneous merge. 
   The only difference with [RSVP-PREEMP] is that this document does not 
   recommend any merge strategies for Admission Priority while [RSVP-
   PREEMP] recommends the first of these merge strategies for Preemption 
   Priority. 
    
   Note that with the Admission Priority (as is the case with the 
   Preemption Priority), "Take highest priority" translates into "take 
   the highest numerical value". 
        
3.2.  Application-Level Resource Priority Policy Element 
    
   The format of the Application-Level Resource Priority policy element

3.2.1.        Application-Level Resource Priority Modifying and Merging        Rules 
    
   When POLICY_DATA objects are protected by integrity, LPDPs should not 
   attempt to modify them. They MUST be forwarded as-is to ensure their 
   security envelope is not invalidated.  
    
   In case of multicast, when POLICY_DATA objects are not protected by 
   integrity, LPDPs MAY merge incoming Application-Level Resource 
   Priority elements to reduce their size and number. When they do merge 
   those, LPDPs MUST do so according to the following rule: 
    
       The ALRP List in the outgoing APP_RESOURCE_PRI element MUST list 
       all the ALRPs appearing in the ALRP List of an incoming 
       APP_RESOURCE_PRI element. A given ALRP MUST NOT appear more than 
       once. In other words, the outgoing ALRP List is the union of the 
       incoming ALRP Lists that are merged. 
    
   As merging is only applicable to Multicast, this rule only applies to 
   Multicast sessions. 

    
3.3.  Default Handling

   As specified in section 4.2 of [RSVP-POLICY], Policy Ignorant Nodes 
   (PINs) implement a default handling of POLICY_DATA objects ensuring 
   that those objects can traverse PIN nodes in transit from one PEP to 
   another. This applies to the situations where POLICY_DATA objects 
   contain the Admission Priority Policy Element and the ALRP Policy 
   Element specified in this document, so that those can traverse PIN 
   nodes. 
    
   Section 4.2 of [RSVP-POLICY] also defines a similar default behavior 
   for policy-capable nodes that do not recognized a particular Policy 
   Element. This applies to the Admission Priority Policy Element and 
   the ALRP Policy Element specified in this document, so that those can 
   traverse policy-capable nodes that do not support this document. 
    
    
4.  Security Considerations 
    
   The ADMISSION_PRI and APP_RESOURCE_PRI are Policy Elements that can 
   be signaled by RSVP through encapsulation in a Policy Data object as 
   defined in [RSVP-POLICY]. Therefore, like any other Policy Elements, 
   their integrity can be protected as discussed in section 6 of [RSVP-
   POLICY] by two optional security mechanisms. The first mechanism 
   relies on RSVP Authentication as specified in [RSVP-CRYPTO-1] and 
   [RSVP-CRYPTO-2] to provide a chain of trust when all RSVP nodes are 
   policy capable. With this mechanism, the INTEGRITY object is carried 
   inside RSVP messages. The second mechanism relies on the INTEGRITY 
   object within the POLICY_DATA object to guarantee integrity between 
   RSVP Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs) that are not RSVP neighbors. 
     
4.1.  Use of RSVP Authentication between RSVP nighbors 
    
   This mechanism can be used can be used between RSVP neighbors that 
   are policy capable. The RSVP neighbors use shared keys to compute the 
   cryptographic signature of the RSVP message. [RSVP-GROUPKEYING] 
   discusses key types, key provisioning methods as well as their 
   respective applicability. 
    
     
4.2.  Use of INTEGRITY object within the POLICY_DATA object 
     
   The INTEGRITY object within the POLICY_DATA object can be used to 
   guarantee integrity between non-neighboring RSVP PEPs. 
     
   Details for computation of the content of the INTEGRITY object can be 
   found in Appendix B of [RSVP-POLICY]. This states that the Policy 
   Decision Point (PDP), at its discretion, and based on destination 
   PEP/PDP or other criteria, selects an Authentication Key and the hash 
   algorithm to be used. Keys to be used between PDPs can be distributed 

 
 
Le Faucheur, et al.                                          [Page 12] 
                RSVP Extensions for Emergency Services    January 2008 
 
 
   manually or via standard key management protocol for secure key 
   distribution. 
     
   Note that where non-RSVP hops may exist in between RSVP hops, as well 
   as where RSVP capable Policy Ignorant Nodes (PINs) may exist in 
   between PEPs, it may be difficult for the PDP to determine what is 
   the destination PDP for a POLICY_DATA object contained in some RSVP 
   messages (such as a Path message). This is because in those cases the 
   next PEP is not known at the time of forwarding the message. In this 
   situation, key shared across multiple PDPs may be used. This is 
   conceptually similar to the use of key shared across multiple RSVP 
   neighbors discussed in  [RSVP-GROUPKEYING]. We observe also that this 
   issue may not exist in some deployment scenarios where a single (or 
   low number of) PDP is used to control all the PEPs of a region (such 
   as an administrative domain). In such scenarios, it may be easy for a 
   PDP to determine what is the next hop PDP, even when the next hop PEP 
   is not known, simply by determining what is the next region that will 
   be traversed (say based on the destination address). 
    
    
5.  IANA Considerations  
    
   As specified in [RSVP-POLICY], Standard RSVP Policy Elements (P-type 
   values) are to be assigned by IANA as per "IETF Consensus" following 
   the policies outlined in [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS]. 
    
   IANA needs to allocate two P-Types from the Standard RSVP Policy 
   Element range: 
           - one P-Type to the Admission Priority Policy Element 
           - one P-Type to the Application-Level Resource Priority 
             Policy Element 
    
   The present document defines an ALRP Namespace field in section 3.2 
   that contains a numerical value identifying the namespace of the 
   application-level resource priority. The IANA already maintains the 
   Resource-Priority Namespaces registry (under the SIP Parameters) 
   listing all such namespace. However, that registry does not currently 
   allocate a numerical value to each namespace. Hence, this document 
   requests the IANA to extend the Resource-Priority Namespace registry 
   in the following ways: 
           - a new column should be added to the registry 
           - the title of the new column should be "Namespace Numerical 
             Value *" 
           - in the Legend, add a line saying "Namespace Numerical 
             Value = the unique numerical value identifying the 
             namespace" 
           - add a line at the bottom of the registry stating the 
             following "* : [RFCXXX] " where XXX is the RFC number of 
             the present document 
 
 
Le Faucheur, et al.                                          [Page 13] 
                RSVP Extensions for Emergency Services    January 2008 
 
 
           - allocate an actual numerical value to each namespace in 
             the registry and state that value in the new "Namespace 
             numerical Value *" column. 
   A numerical value should be allocated immediately by IANA to all 
   existing namespace. Then, in the future, IANA should automatically 
   allocate a numerical value to any new namespace added to the  
   registry.  
    
    
   The present document defines an ALRP Priority field in section 3.2 
   that contains a numerical value identifying the actual application-
   level resource priority within the application-level resource 
   priority namespace. The IANA already maintains the Resource-Priority 
   Priority-values registry (under the SIP Parameters) listing all such 
   priorities. However, that registry does not currently allocate a 
   numerical value to each priority-value. Hence, this document requests 
   the IANA to extend the Resource-Priority Priority-Values registry in 
   the following ways: 
           - for each namespace, the registry should be structured with 
             two columns 
           - the title of the first column should read "Priority Values 
             (least to greatest)" 
           - the first column should list all the values currently 
             defined in the registry (e.g. for the drsn namespace: 
             "routine", "priority", "immediate", "flash", "flash-
             override", "flash-override-override" for the drsn 
             namespace) 
           - the title of the second column should read "Priority 
             Numerical Value *" 
           - At the bottom of the registry, add a "Legend" with a line 
             saying "Priority Numerical Value = the unique numerical 
             value identifying the priority within a namespace" 
           - add a line at the bottom of the registry stating the 
             following "* : [RFCXXX] " where XXX is the RFC number of 
             the present document 
           - allocate an actual numerical value to each and state that 
             value in the new "Priority Numerical Value *" column. 
   A numerical value should be allocated immediately by IANA to all 
   existing priority. Then, in the future, IANA should automatically 
   allocate a numerical value to any new namespace added to the  
   registry. The numerical value must be unique within each namespace. 
   Within each namespace, values should be allocated in decreasing order 
   ending with 0 (so that the greatest priority is always allocated 
   value 0). For example, in the drsn namespace, "routine" would be 
   allocated numerical value 5 and "flash-override-override" would be 
   allocated numerical value 0.

Appendix A: Examples of Bandwidth Allocation Model for Admission 
Priority 
 
   Sections A.1 and A.2 respectively illustrate how the Maximum 
   Allocation Model [DSTE-MAM] and the Russian Dolls Model (RDM) [DSTE-
   RDM] can be used for support of admission priority. Section A.3 
   illustrates how a simple "Priority Bypass Model" can also be used for 
   support of admission priority. 
    
   For simplicity, operations with only a single "priority" level 
   (beyond non-priority) are illustrated here; However, the reader will 
   appreciate that operations with multiple priority levels can easily 
   be supported with these models.  
    
   In all the charts below: 
      x represents a non-priority session 
      o represents a priority session 
    
 A.1  Admission Priority with Maximum Allocation Model (MAM) 
    
   This section illustrates operations of admission priority when a 
   Maximum Allocation Model (MAM) is used for bandwidth allocation 
   across non-priority traffic and priority traffic. A property of the 
   Maximum Allocation Model is that priority traffic can not use more 
   than the bandwidth made available to priority traffic (even if the 
   non-priority traffic is not using all of the bandwidth available for 
   it).

           Chart 1. MAM Bandwidth Allocation

   Chart 1 shows a link within a routed network conforming to this 
   document. On this link are two amounts of bandwidth available to two 
   types of traffic: non-priority and priority.   
   If the non-priority traffic load reaches the maximum bandwidth 
   available for non-priority, no additional non-priority sessions can 
   be accepted even if the bandwidth reserved for priority traffic is 
   not currently fully utilized. 
    
   With the Maximum Allocation Model, in the case where the priority 
   load reaches the maximum bandwidth reserved for priority calls, no 
   additional priority sessions can be accepted. 
    
   As illustrated in Chart 1, an operator may map the MAM model onto the 
   Engineered Capacity limits according to different policies. At one 
   extreme, where the proportion of priority traffic is reliably known 
   to be fairly small at all times and where there may be some safety 
   margin factored in the engineered capacity limits, the operator may 
   decide to configure the bandwidth available for non-priority use to 
   the full engineered capacity limits; effectively allowing the 
   priority traffic to ride within the safety margin of this engineered 
   capacity. This policy can be seen as an economically attractive 
   approach as all of the engineered capacity is made available to non-
   priority calls. This policy illustrated as (1) in Chart 1. As an 
   example, if the engineered capacity limit on a given link is X, the 
   operator may configure the bandwidth available to non-priority 
   traffic to X, and the bandwidth available to priority traffic to 5% 
   of X. 
    
   At the other extreme, where the proportion of priority traffic may be 
   significant at times and the engineered capacity limits are very 
   tight, the operator may decide to configure the bandwidth available 
   to non-priority traffic and the bandwidth available to priority 
   traffic such that their sum is equal to the engineered capacity 
   limits. This guarantees that the total load across non-priority and 
   priority traffic is always below the engineered capacity and, in  
   turn, guarantees there will never be any QoS degradation. However, 
   this policy is less attractive economically as it prevents non-
   priority calls from using the full engineered capacity, even when 
   there is no or little priority load, which is the majority of time. 
   This policy illustrated as (3) in Chart 1. As an example, if the 
   engineered capacity limit on a given link is X, the operator may 
   configure the bandwidth available to non-priority traffic to 95%  
   of X, and the bandwidth available to priority traffic to 5% of X. 
    
   Of course, an operator may also strike a balance anywhere in between 
   these two approaches. This policy illustrated as (2) in Chart 1. 
    
   Chart 2 shows some of the non-priority capacity of this link being 
   used.

A.2  Admission Priority with Russian Dolls Model (RDM) 
    
   This section illustrates operations of admission priority when a 
   Russian Dolls Model (RDM) is used for bandwidth allocation across 
   non-priority traffic and priority traffic. A property of the Russian 
   Dolls Model is that priority traffic can use the bandwidth which is 
   not currently used by non-priority traffic. 
    
   As with the MAM model, an operator may map the RDM model onto the 
   Engineered Capacity limits according to different policies. The 
   operator may decide to configure the bandwidth available for non-
   priority use to the full engineered capacity limits; As an example, 
   if the engineered capacity limit on a given link is X, the operator 
   may configure the bandwidth available to non-priority traffic to X, 
   and the bandwidth available to non-priority and priority traffic to 
   105% of X.  
    
   Alternatively, the operator may decide to configure the bandwidth 
   available to non-priority and priority traffic to the engineered 
   capacity limits; As an example, if the engineered capacity limit on a 
   given link is X, the operator may configure the bandwidth available 
   to non-priority traffic to 95% of X, and the bandwidth available to 
   non-priority and priority traffic to X.  
    
   Finally, the operator may decide to strike a balance in between. The 
   considerations presented for these policies in the previous section 
   in the MAM context are equally applicable to RDM.  
    
   Chart 6 shows the case where only some of the bandwidth available to 
   non-priority traffic is being used and a small amount of priority 
   traffic is in place. In that situation both new non-priority sessions 
   and new priority sessions would be accepted.

 A.3  Admission Priority with Priority Bypass Model (PrBM) 
 
   This section illustrates operations of admission priority when a 
   simple Priority Bypass Model (PrBM) is used for bandwidth allocation 
   across non-priority traffic and priority traffic. With the Priority 
   Bypass Model, non-priority traffic is subject to resource based 
   admission control while priority traffic simply bypasses the resource 
   based admission control. In other words: 
      - when a non-priority call arrives, this call is subject to 
   bandwidth admission control and is accepted if the current total load 
   (aggregate over non-priority and priority traffic) is below the 
   engineered/allocated bandwidth.  
      - when a priority call arrives, this call is admitted regardless 
   of the current load.  
    
   A property of this model is that a priority call is never rejected.

                RSVP Extensions for Emergency Services    January 2008 
 
 
   The rationale for this simple scheme is that, in practice in some 
   networks: 
      - the volume of priority calls is very low for the vast majority 
        of time, so it may not be economical to completely set aside 
        bandwidth for priority calls and preclude the utilization of 
        this bandwidth by normal calls in normal situations 
      - even in emergency periods where priority calls are more heavily 
        used, those always still represent a fairly small proportion of 
        the overall load which can be absorbed within the safety margin 
        of the engineered capacity limits. Thus, even if they are 
        admitted beyond the engineered bandwidth threshold, they are 
        unlikely to result in noticeable QoS degradation. 
    
   As with the MAM and RDM model, an operator may map the Priority 
   Bypass model onto the Engineered Capacity limits according to 
   different policies. The operator may decide to configure the 
   bandwidth limit for admission of non-priority traffic to the full 
   engineered capacity limits; As an example, if the engineered capacity 
   limit on a given link is X, the operator may configure the bandwidth 
   limit for non-priority traffic to X. Alternatively, the operator may 
   decide to configure the bandwidth limit for non-priority traffic to 
   below the engineered capacity limits (so that the sum of the non-
   priority and priority traffic stays below the engineered capacity); 
   As an example, if the engineered capacity limit on a given link is X, 
   the operator may configure the bandwidth limit for non-priority 
   traffic to 95% of X. Finally, the operator may decide to strike a 
   balance in between. The considerations presented for these policies 
   in the previous sections in the MAM and RDM contexts are equally 
   applicable to the Priority Bypass Model.  
    
   Chart 10 shows illustrates the bandwidth allocation with the Priority 
   Bypass Model.

Appendix B: Example Usages of RSVP Extensions        
    
   This section provides examples of how RSVP extensions defined in this 
   document can be used (in conjunctions with other RSVP functionality 
   and SIP functionality) to enforce different hypothetical policies for 
   handling Emergency sessions in a given administrative domain. This 
   Appendix does not provide additional specification. It is only 
   included in this document for illustration purposes. 
    
   We assume an environment where SIP is used for session control and 
   RSVP is used for resource reservation. 
    
   In a mild abuse of language, we refer here to "Call Queueing" as the 
   set of "session" layer capabilities that may be implemented by SIP 
   user agents to influence their treatment of SIP requests. This may 
   include the ability to "queue" call requests when those can not be 
   immediately honored (in some cases with the notion of "bumping", or 
   "displacement", of less important call request from that queue). It 
   may include additional mechanisms such as exemption from certain 
   network management controls, and alternate routing. 
    
   We only mention below the RSVP policy elements that are to be 
   enforced by PEPs. It is assumed that these policy elements are set at 
   administrative domain boundaries by PDPs. The Admission Priority and 
   Preemption Priority RSVP policy elements are set by PDPs as a result

   of processing the Application Level Resource Priority Policy Element 
   (which is carried in RSVP messages). 
    
   If one wants to implement an emergency service purely based on Call 
   Queueing, one can achieve this by signaling emergency calls: 
      * using "Resource-Priority" Header in SIP 
      * not using Admission-Priority Policy Element in RSVP 
      * not using Preemption Policy Element in RSVP 
    
   If one wants to implement an emergency service based on Call 
   Queueing and on "prioritized access to network layer resources", one 
   can achieve this by signaling emergency calls: 
      * using "Resource-Priority" Header in SIP 
      * using Admission-Priority Policy Element in RSVP 
      * not using Preemption Policy Element in RSVP 
   Emergency calls will not result in preemption of any session. 
   Different bandwidth allocation models can be used to offer different 
   "prioritized access to network resources". Just as examples, this 
   includes strict setting aside of capacity for emergency sessions as 
   well as simple bypass of admission limits for emergency sessions. 
    
   If one wants to implement an emergency service based on Call  
   Queueing, 
   on "prioritized access to network layer resources", and ensures that 
   (say) "Emergency-1" sessions can preempt "Emergency-2" sessions, but 
   non-emergency sessions are not affected by preemption, one can do 
   that by signaling emergency calls: 
      * using "Resource-Priority" Header in SIP 
      * using Admission-Priority Policy Element in RSVP  
      * using Preemption Policy Element in RSVP with: 
            o setup (Emergency-1) > defending (Emergency-2) 
            o setup (Emergency-2) <= defending (Emergency-1) 
            o setup (Emergency-1) <= defending (Non-Emergency) 
            o setup (Emergency-2) <= defending (Non-Emergency) 
    
   If one wants to implement an emergency service based on Call  
   Queueing, 
   on "prioritized access to network layer resources", and ensure that 
   "emergency" sessions can preempt regular sessions, one could do that 
   by signaling emergency calls: 
      * using "Resource-Priority" Header in SIP 
      * using Admission-Priority Policy Element in RSVP 
      * using Preemption Policy Element in RSVP with: 
            o setup (Emergency) > defending (Non-Emergency) 
            o setup (Non-Emergency) <= defending (Emergency) 
    
   If one wants to implement an emergency service based on Call  
   Queueing, 
   on "prioritized access to network layer resources", and ensure that

   "emergency" sessions can partially preempt regular sessions (ie 
   reduce their reservation size), one could do that by signaling 
   emergency calls: 
      * using "Resource-Priority" Header in SIP 
      * using Admission-Priority Policy Element in RSVP 
      * using Preemption in Policy Element RSVP with: 
            o setup (Emergency) > defending (Non-Emergency) 
            o setup (Non-Emergency) <= defending (Emergency) 
      * activate RFC4495 RSVP Bandwidth Reduction mechanisms
