                    Making Route Flap Damping Usable
                        draft-ymbk-rfd-usable-00

Abstract

   Route Flap Damping (RFD) was first proposed to reduce BGP churn in
   routers.  Unfortunately, RFD was found to severely penalize sites for
   being well-connected because topological richness amplifies the
   number of update messages exchanged.  Many operators have turned RFD
   off.  This document recommends adjusting a few RFD algorithmic
   constants and limits, to reduce the high risks with RFD, with the
   result being damping a non-trivial amount of long term churn without
   penalizing well-behaved prefixes' normal convergence process.

1.  Suggested Reading

   It is assumed that the reader understands BGP, [RFC4271] and Route
   Flap Damping, [RFC2439].  This work is based on the measurements in
   the paper [pelsser2011].


2.  Introduction

   Route Flap Damping (RFD) was first proposed (see [ripe178] and
   [RFC2439]) and subsequently implemented to reduce BGP churn in
   routers.  Unfortunately, RFD was found to severely penalize sites for
   being well-connected because topological richness amplifies the
   number of update messages exchanged, see [mao2002].  Subsequently,
   many operators turned RFD off, see [ripe378].  This document
   recommends adjusting a few RFD algorithmic constants and limits, with
   the result being damping of a non-trivial amount of long term churn
   without penalizing well-behaved prefixes' normal convergence process.

   Very few prefixes are responsible for a large amount of the BGP
   messages received by a router, see [huston2006] and [pelsser2011].
   For example, [pelsser2011] showed that only 3% of the prefixes were
   responsible for 36% percent of the BGP messages at a router with real
   feeds from a Tier-1 and an Internet Exchange Point during a one week
   experiment.  Only these very frequently flapping prefixes should be
   damped.  The values recommended in Section 6 achieve this.  Thus, RFD
   can be enabled, and some churn reduced.

   The goal is to, with absolutely minimal change, ameliorate the danger
   of current RFD implementations and use.  It is not a panacea, nor is
   it a deep and thorough approach to flap reduction.


3.  Suppress Threshold Versus Churn

   By turning RFD back on with the values recommended in Section 6 churn
   is reduced.  Moreover, with these values, prefixes going through
   normal convergence are generally not damped.

   [pelsser2011] estimates that, with a suppress threshold of 6,000, the
   BGP update rate is reduced by 19% compared to a situation without RFD
   enabled.  With this 6K suppress threshold, 90% fewer prefixes are
   damped compared to use of a 2K threshold.  I.e. far fewer well-
   behaved prefixes are damped.

   Setting the suppress threshold to 12K leads to very few damped
   prefixes (1.7% of the prefixes damped with a threshold of 2K, in the
   experiments in [pelsser2011] yielding an average hourly update

5.  Maximum Penalty

   It is important to understand that the parameters shown in Table 2,
   and the implementation's sampling rate, impose an upper bound on the
   penalty value, which we can call the 'computed maximum penalty'.

   In addition, BGP implementations have an internal constant which we
   will call the 'maximum penalty' which the current computed penalty
   may not exceed.


6.  Recommendations

   The following changes are recommended:

   Router Maximum Penalty:  The internal constant for the maximum
      penalty value MUST be raised to at least 50,000.

   Default Configurable Parameters:  In order not to break existing
      operational configurations, BGP implementations SHOULD NOT change
      the default values in Table 2.

   Minimum Suppress Threshold:  Operators wishing damping which is much
      less destructive than current, but still somewhat aggressive
      SHOULD configure the Suppress Threshold to no less than 6,000.

   Conservative Suppress Threshold:  Conservative operators SHOULD
      configure the Suppress Threshold to no less than 12,000.

   Calculate But Do Not Damp:  Implementations MAY have a test mode
      where the operator could see the results of a particular
      configuration without actually damping any prefixes.  This will
      allow for fine tuning of parameters without losing reachability.


7.  Security Considerations

   It is well known that an attacker can generate false flapping to
   cause a victim's prefix(es) to be damped.

   As the recommendations merely change parameters to more conservative
   values, there should be no increase in risk.

   In fact, the parameter change to more conservative values should
   slightly mitigate the false flap attack.
