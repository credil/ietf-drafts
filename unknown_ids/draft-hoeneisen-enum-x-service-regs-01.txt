Abstract

   This document provides a guide to the creation of new IANA
   registrations of experimental, private or trial ENUM (E.164 Number
   Mapping) services.  It is also to be used for updates of those
   experimental, private or trial Enumservice (X-Enumservice)
   registrations.

Internet-Draft         X-Enumservice Registrations              Jun 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document provides a guide to the creation of new IANA
   registrations of X-Enumservices.  This document aims to enhance
   section 3 of RFC 3761 [2], where the registration procedure for
   Enumservices was initially documented at a high level.  It further
   complements the Guide and Template for IANA Registrations of
   Enumservices [3].

   The X-Enumservice registration is intended to allow people to use the
   normal Enumservice template to describe what X-Enumservice strings
   exist in NAPTR Resource Records and to describe how they are used,
   but not (yet) to require a full IETF review and change control.

   This is needed as some trials use URL schemes that are not
   registered, and so cannot be used in Standards Track Enumservice
   registrations.  Also, until trials have been completed, it may not be
   appropriate to produce a Standards Track document, as Enumservice
   syntax details, use and issues of security / privacy may not have
   been analyzed fully at that point.

   For the purpose of this document, 'registration document' and
   'registration' refers to an Internet Draft proposing the IANA
   registration of an X-Enumservice following the procedures outlined
   above.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].


3.  Required Sections and Information

   A document for registration of an X-Enumservice is similar to a
   ordinary Enumservice registration as described in Guide and Template
   for IANA Registrations of Enumservices [3] except for the following:

   o  Enumservice Name:

         The Enumservice Name MUST either contain a string
         "experimental", "private" or "trial", or the Name is prefixed
         with "X-".

         e.g.  "X-Foo"

Internet-Draft         X-Enumservice Registrations              Jun 2007


   o  Enumservice Type:

         The Type MUST be prefixed with "x-".

         e.g. "x-foo"

   o  URI Schemes:

         The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) [5] Schemes, which are
         used with an X-Enumservice do not necessarily need to be
         documented in an IETF document.  If a publicly referenceable
         document is available it MUST be referenced in the registration
         document.  In case there is no publicly referenceable document,
         the URI Scheme MUST be sufficiently described in the
         registration document.

   o  Functional Specification:

         This section quite depends on how much publicly available
         documentation about the service already exists.

   o  Intended Usage:

         For the Intended Usage RFC 3761 [2] is extended with
         "EXPERIMENTAL", "PRIVATE", and "TRIAL".  One of those is to be
         used.

         e.g.  "TRIAL"


4.  Expert Review

   A new X-Enumservice MUST undergo Expert Review before publication.
   This expert review will include an initial evaluation of whether this
   specification will have issues in transferring to a Standards Track
   document (for example, if it uses an unregistered URL scheme, or that
   the security and privacy analysis is incomplete at this stage).

   It will also indicate whether the use of this X-Enumservice will
   clash with any other (X-)Enumservices or cause damage to other
   compliant ENUM components, and should be used only in private
   configurations where all involved components are aware of its use.

   The results of such an expert review SHOULD be appended to the
   registration document and will be recorded along with the
   specification itself.

   However, the exact expert review process is to be defined.  This

   process will be a simplified variant of the process for normal
   Enumservice registrations, which is still under specification.


5.  Security Considerations

   Since this document does not introduce any technology or protocol,
   there are no security issues to be considered for this memo itself.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces three new strings for Intended Usage as
   defined in RFC 3761 [2].  These new strings are: "EXPERIMENTAL",
   "PRIVATE", and "TRIAL".  The revision of RFC 3761 [2] RFC3761bis [4]
   shall contain these new strings.  Furthermore the dash in the 'X-'
   string needs to be put into the set of allowed characters in an
   Enumservice Type.  In case the revision of RFC 3761 is not yet ready
   at publication time of this memo, an intermediary regime needs to be
   defined.

   An IANA Registry for X-Enumservices is to be defined.
