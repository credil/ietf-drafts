    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The BGP4 protocol specifies the selection and propagation of a single
   best path for each prefix.  Apart from BGP Add-Paths Proposal , today BGP has no 
   other mechanisms to  distribute paths other then best path between its speakers. BGP Divrsepath
    proposal does  not specify any changes to the BGP protocol  definition as specificed by BGP 
    Add-Paths 
  proposal.  It does not require  upgrades to provider edge or core  routers nor does
    it need network wide
  upgrades.  Diverse Path attempts do solve the  addpath problem and
    provision an interim
 solution to the customers who cannot deploy addpath solution on certain
    networks. Due to the simple
 natiure of Diverse Path with  simple upgrades and configuration
     to the  Route Reflectors without 
  any configurations on the edge routers,  
     Diverse Path becomes very easy to deploy</t>

      <t>This document provides an implementation report for  Diverse Path 
      as defined in draft-ietf-grow-diverse-bgp-path-dist-03</t>

      <t>The editor did not verify the accuracy of the information provided by
      respondents or by any alternative means. The respondents are experts
      with the implementations they reported on, and their responses are
      considered authoritative for the implementations for which their
      responses represent.</t>

      <section title="Support for multiple RRs">
        <t>Does the implementation support Sec.4.
            [draft-ietf-grow-diverse-bgp-path-dist-03] Provision for Multi plane
            route reflection?</t>

        <t>Cisco: YES</t>

      
        <t>Does the implementation provide support for
	Sec4.1[draft-ietf-grow-diverse-bgp-path-dist-03 ]  Co-located best
	and backup path RRs?</t>

          <t>Cisco: YES</t>

  	<section title="Path Selection">

        <t>Does BGP diverse Path implementation follow the
 	procedures for selection of the bestpath outlined in Section
 	9.1.Decision Process in RFC 4271?  </t>

  <t>Cisco: YES</t>
    
  </section>


<section title="Deployment Consideration">

        <t>Does BGP diverse Path implementation be easily enabled by
	introduction of a new route reflector, route server plane dedicated to
	the selection and distribution of Nth best-path?</t>

       <t>Cisco: YES</t>
            

        <t>Does BGP diverse Path implementation require any upgrades to the
	edge/core routers?</t>

          <t>Cisco: NO</t>

         <t>Can BGP diverse Path implementation be deployed on multiple RR
	clusters? </t>
	
	
<t>Cisco: YES</t>
	
     <t>Does your BGP diverse Path implementation involve major modification
	to BGP implementations in the entire network?</t>

 
  	<t>Cisco: NO</t>
  </section>
  
  
<section title="Usage of Diverse Path">


  <t>Does BGP diverse Path implementation require any modifications to
	BGP4 protocol?</t>

        <t>Does it help in the Multi-path load balancing applications for both
	IBGP and EBGP?</t>

 	<t>Cisco: YES</t>
       <t>Does the implementation support second session from RR to the same
	RR-client preferably terminated at a different loopback address of the
	route reflector and provide second bestpath to the RR-client?</t>

          <t>Cisco: NO</t>

 <section title="Bestpath algorithm">
        <t>Does it add any modifications to the 9.1.Decision Process in RFC
	4271? Does it skip any steps in the decision process?</t>

       <t>Cisco: NO. No modifications to the algorithm are done except when  RRs are
	not co-located and have different metric to reach the edge routers. A configurable CLI command is
	provided for the user to control the disabling of  the IGP metric check in the
	Decision Process to select bestpath and backupath </t>
      
      
    <t>Does the implementation provide support for disabling IGP metric for
	bestpath selection on Sec 4.2 [draft-ietf-grow-diverse-bgp-path-dist-03] 
	randomly located best and backup path RRs?</t>

          <t>Cisco: YES</t>

      <section title="Interoperable Implementations">
        <t>List other implementations that you have tested interoperability of
        Diverse Path</t>

        <t>Cisco: The implementation should be interoperable with other vendor BGP implementations
        	as no BGP Protocol changes are needed</t>
