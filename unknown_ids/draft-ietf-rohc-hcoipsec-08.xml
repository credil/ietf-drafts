   IP Security (IPsec) provides various security services for IP
   traffic.  However, the benefits of IPsec come at the cost of
   increased overhead.  This document outlines a framework for
   integrating Robust Header Compression (RoHC) over IPsec (RoHCoIPsec).

   to reduce the amount of overhead associated with the transmission of
   traffic over IPsec Security Associations (SAs).

      <t>
   This document outlines a framework for integrating RoHC [ROHC] over
   IPsec [IPSEC] (RoHCoIPsec).  The goal of RoHCoIPsec is to reduce the
   protocol overhead associated with packets traversing between IPsec SA
   endpoints.  This can be achieved by compressing the transport layer
   header (e.g., UDP, TCP, etc.) and inner IP header of packets at the
   ingress of the IPsec tunnel, and decompressing these headers at the
   egress.
			</t>
      <t>
   For RoHCoIPsec, this document assumes that RoHC will be used to
   compress the inner headers of IP packets traversing an IPsec tunnel.
   However, since current specifications for RoHC detail its operation
   on a hop-by-hop basis, it may require extensions to enable its
   operation over IPsec SAs.  This document outlines a framework for
   extending the usage of RoHC to operate at IPsec SA endpoints.
			</t>
      <t>
   RoHCoIPsec targets the application of RoHC to tunnel mode SAs.
   Transport mode SAs only encrypt/authenticate the payload of an IP
   packet, leaving the IP header untouched.  Intermediate routers
   subsequently use this IP header to route the packet to a decryption
   device.  Therefore, if RoHC is to operate over IPsec transport-mode
   SAs, (de)compression functionality can only be applied to the
   transport layer headers, and not to the IP header.  Because current
   RoHC specifications do not include support for the compression of
   transport layer headers alone, the RoHCoIPsec framework outlined by
   this document describes the application of RoHC to tunnel mode SAs.

    <section title="Problem Statement: IPsec Packet Overhead" toc="default">
      <t>
   IPsec mechanisms provide various security services for IP networks.
   However, the benefits of IPsec come at the cost of increased per-
   packet overhead.  For example, traffic flow confidentiality
   (generally leveraged at security gateways) requires the tunneling of
   IP packets between IPsec implementations.  Although these IPsec
   tunnels will effectively mask the source-destination patterns that an
   intruder can ascertain, tunneling comes at the cost of increased per-
   packet overhead.  Specifically, an ESP tunnel mode SA applied to an
   IPv6 flow results in at least 50 bytes of additional overhead per
   packet.  This additional overhead may be undesirable for many
   bandwidth-constrained wireless and/or satellite communications
   networks, as these types of infrastructure are not overprovisioned.
   RoHC applied on a per-hop basis over bandwidth-constrained links will
   also suffer from reduced performance when encryption is used on the
   tunneled header, since encrypted headers can not be compressed.
   Consequently, the additional overhead incurred by an IPsec tunnel may
   result in the inefficient utilization of bandwidth.
			</t>
      <t>
   Packet overhead is particularly significant for traffic profiles
   characterized by small packet payloads (e.g. various voice codecs).
   If these small packets are afforded the security
   services of an IPsec tunnel mode SA, the amount of per-packet
   overhead is increased.  Thus, a mechanism is needed to reduce the
   overhead associated with such flows.
			</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Overview of the RoHCoIPsec Framework" toc="default">
      <section title="RoHCoIPsec Assumptions" toc="default">
        <t>
   The goal of RoHCoIPsec is to provide efficient transport of IP
   packets between IPsec devices, without compromising the security
   services offered by IPsec.  The RoHCoIPsec framework has
   been developed based on the following assumptions:
			</t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
RoHC will be leveraged to reduce the amount of overhead associated with packets traversing an IPsec SA
				</t>
        </list>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
RoHC will be instantiated at the IPsec SA endpoints, and will be applied on a per-SA basis
				</t>
        </list>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
Once the decompression operation completes, decompressed packet headers will be identical to the original packet headers before compression
				</t>
        </list>
      </section>
      <section title="Summary of the RoHCoIPsec Framework" toc="default">
        <t>
   RoHC reduces packet overhead in a network by exploiting intra- and
   inter-packet redundancies of network and transport-layer header
   fields of a flow.
			</t>
        <t>Current RoHC protocol specifications compress packet headers on a hop-by-hop basis.  However, IPsec SAs are instantiated between two IPsec endpoints.  Therefore, various extensions to both RoHC and IPsec need to be defined to ensure the successful operation of the RoHC protocol at IPsec SA endpoints.	</t>
        <t>The migration of RoHC over IPsec SAs is straightforward, since SA endpoints provide source/destination pairs where (de)compression operations can take place.  Compression of the inner IP and upper layer protocol headers in such a manner offers a reduction of per-packet protocol overhead between the two SA endpoints.  Since RoHC will now operate between IPsec endpoints (over multiple intermediate nodes which are transparent to an IPsec SA), it is imperative to ensure that its performance will not be severely impacted due to increased packet reordering and/or packet loss between the compressor and decompressor.</t>
        <t>
   In addition, RoHC can no longer rely on the underlying link layer for
   RoHC parameter configuration and packet identification.  The
   RoHCoIPsec framework proposes that RoHC channel parameter
   configuration is accomplished by an SA management protocol (e.g.,
   IKEv2 [IKEV2]), while identification of compressed header packets is
   achieved through the Next Header field of the security protocol
   (e.g., AH [AH], ESP [ESP]) header.
			</t>
        <t>Using the RoHCoIPsec framework proposed below, outbound and inbound IP traffic processing at an IPsec device needs to be modified. For an outbound packet, a RoHCoIPsec implementation will compress appropriate packet headers, and subsequently encrypt and/or integrity-protect the packet.  For tunnel mode SAs, compression may be applied to the transport layer protocol and the inner IP header.  For inbound packets, an IPsec device must first decrypt and/or integrity-check the packet.  Then decompression of the inner packet headers is performed.  After decompression, the packet is checked against the access controls imposed on all inbound traffic associated with the SA (as specified in [IPSEC]).

			</t>
        <t>
          <list style="empty">
            <t>Note: Compression of inner headers is independent from compression of the security protocol (e.g., ESP) and outer IP headers.  RoHC is capable of compressing the security protocol and the outer IP header on a hop-by-hop basis.  The applicability of RoHCoIPsec and hop-by-hop RoHC on an IPv4 ESP-processed packet [ESP] is shown below in Figure 1.</t>

          </figure>
        </t>
        
   <t>The process illustrated in Figure 2 augments the IPsec processing
   model for outbound IP traffic (protected-to-unprotected).  Initial
   IPsec processing is consistent with [IPSEC] (Steps 1-2, Section 5.1).</t>

   <t>Block A: The RoHC data item (part of the SA state information) retrieved from
   the "relevant SAD entry" ([IPSEC], Section 5.1, Step3a) determines if
   the traffic traversing the SA is handed to the RoHC module.  Packets selected to a RoHC-disabled SA must
   follow normal IPsec processing and must not be sent to the RoHC
   module (Figure 1, Path 3).  Conversely, packets selected to a RoHC-enabled 
   SA must be sent to the RoHC module.</t>

   <t>Block B: This step determines if the packet can be compressed.  If it is determined
   that the packet will be compressed, an Integrity Algorithm is used to
   compute an Integrity Check Value (ICV) for the uncompressed packet
   ([IPSEC-ROHC], Section 3.2 [IKE-ROHC], Section 2.1).  The
   Next Header field of the security protocol header (e.g., ESP, AH) is
   populated with a "RoHC" identifier, the packet headers are
   compressed, and the computed ICV is appended to the packet (Figure 1, Path 1).  
   However, if it is
   determined that the packet will not be compressed (e.g., due to one
   the reasons described in Section 6.1.3), the Next Header field is
   populated with the appropriate value indicating the next level
   protocol (Figure 1, Path 2).</t>

   <t>After the RoHC process completes, IPsec
   processing resumes, as described in Section 5.1, Step3a, of [IPSEC].</t>

   <t>The process illustrated in Figure 2 also augments the IPsec
   processing model for inbound IP traffic (unprotected-to-protected).
   For inbound packets, IPsec processing is performed ([IPSEC], Section
   5.2, Steps 1-3) followed by AH or ESP processing ([IPSEC], Section
   5.2, Step 4).</t>

   <t>Block A: After AH or ESP processing, the RoHC data item
   retrieved from the SAD entry will indicate if traffic traversing the
   SA is processed by the RoHC module ([IPSEC], Section 5.2, Step 3a).
   Packets traversing an RoHC-disabled SA must follow normal IPsec
   processing and must not be sent to the RoHC module.  Conversely,
   packets traversing an RoHC-enabled SA must be sent to the RoHC
   module.</t> 

   <t>Block B: The decision at Block B is determined by the value of the
   Next Header field of the security protocol header.  If the
   Next Header field does not indicate a RoHC header, the decompressor
   must not attempt decompression (Figure 1, Path 2).  If the Next Header 
   field indicates a RoHC header, decompression is applied.  After decompression, the RoHCoIPsec
   Integrity Algorithm is used to compute an ICV value for the decompressed 
   packet.  This ICV is compared to the ICV that was calculated at the 
   compressor:  if the ICVs match, the packet is forwarded by the RoHC 
   module (Figure 1, Path 1); otherwise, the packet is dropped.  Once the RoHC
   module completes processing, IPsec processing resumes, as described
   in Section 5.2, Step 4 of [IPSEC].</t>

   <t>Note that to further reduce the size of an IPsec-protected packet,
   RoHCoIPsec and IPcomp [IPCOMP] can be implemented in a nested
   fashion.  This process is detailed in [IPSEC-ROHC], Section 3.2.
			</t>
   
   <section title="Header Compression Protocol Considerations" toc="default">
   <t>RoHCv2 [ROHCV2] profiles include various mechanisms that provide 
   increased robustness over reordering channels.  These mechanisms must 
   be adopted for RoHC to operate efficiently over IPsec SAs.</t>

   <t> A RoHC decompressor
   implemented within IPsec architecture may leverage additional
   mechanisms to improve performance over reordering channels (either
   due to random events, or to an attacker intentionally reordering
   packets).  Specifically, IPsec's sequence number may be used by the
   decompressor to identify a packet as "sequentially late".  This
   knowledge will increase the likelihood of successful decompression of
   a reordered packet.</t>

   <t>Additionally, RoHCoIPsec implementations should minimize the amount
   of feedback sent from the decompressor to the compressor.  If a ROHC
   feedback channel is not used sparingly, the overall gains from
   RoHCoIPsec can be significantly reduced.  More specifically, any
   feedback sent from the decompressor to the compressor must be
   processed by IPsec, and tunneled back to the compressor (as
   designated by the SA associated with FEEDBACK_FOR).  As such, several implementation considerations are offered:
			<list style="symbols"><t>Eliminate feedback traffic altogether by operating only in RoHC Unidirectional mode (U-mode)</t></list><list style="symbols"><t>Piggyback RoHC feedback messages on traffic that normally traverses the SA designated by FEEDBACK_FOR.</t></list></t>
   </section>
   
   <section title="Initialization and Negotiation of the RoHC Channel" toc="default">
          <t>
   RoHC can use the underlying link layer (e.g., PPP) to automatically RoHC
   channel parameters.  In the case of RoHCoIPsec, channel parameters
   can be achieved manually (i.e., administratively
   configured for manual SAs), or by IKEv2.  The extensions required for IKEv2 to support RoHC
   parameter negotiation are detailed in [IKE-ROHC].
				</t>
          <t>
   If the RoHC protocol requires bi-directional communications, two SAs
   must be instantiated between the IPsec implementations.  One of the
   two SAs is used for carrying RoHC-traffic from the compressor to the
   decompressor, while the other is used to communicate RoHC-feedback
   from the decompressor to the compressor.  Note that the requirement
   for two SAs aligns with the operation of IKE, which creates SAs in
   pairs by default.  However, IPsec implementations will dictate how decompressor
   feedback received on one SA is associated with a compressor on the
   other SA.
				</t>
   </section>
   
   <section title="Encapsulation and Identification of Header Compressed Packets" toc="default">
          <t>
   As indicated in Section 6.1, new state information (i.e., a new RoHC
   data item) is defined for each SA.  The RoHC data item is used by the
   IPsec process to determine whether it sends all traffic traversing a
   given SA to the RoHC module (RoHC-enabled) or bypasses the RoHC
   module and sends the traffic through regular IPsec processing (RoHC-
   disabled).
				</t>
          <t>
   The Next Header field of the IPsec security protocol (e.g., AH or
   ESP) header is used to demultiplex header-compressed traffic from
   uncompressed traffic traversing an RoHC-enabled SA.  This
   functionality is needed in situations where packets traversing a
   RoHC-enabled SA do not contain compressed headers.  Such situations
   may occur when, for example, a compressor supports strictly n
   compressed flows and can not compress the n+1 flow that arrives.
   Another example is when traffic (e.g., TCP/IP) is selected (by IPsec)
   to a RoHC-enabled SA, but cannot be compressed by the RoHC process
   (e.g., because the compressor does not support TCP/IP compression).
   Similarly, the decompressor must be
   able to identify packets with uncompressed headers and not attempt to
   decompress them.  The Next Header field is used to demultiplex these
   header-compressed versus uncompressed packets, as a RoHC protocol
   identifier will indicate the packet contains compressed headers.  To
   accomplish this, an official IANA allocation from the Protocol ID
   registry [PROTOCOL] is required.
				</t>
          <t>
   The RoHC Data Item, IANA Protocol ID allocation, and other IPsec
   extensions to support RoHCoIPsec, are specified in [IPSEC-ROHC].

   end-hosts.  Such a scenario will result in a decreased efficiency
   between compressor and decompressor.  Furthermore, this may result in
   Denial of Service, as the decompression of a significant number of
   invalid packets may drain the resources of an IPsec device.
