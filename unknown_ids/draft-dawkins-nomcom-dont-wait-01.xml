<abstract>
	<t>This document updates RFC 3777, Section 4, Bullet 13 to allow announcement of open positions 
		and solicitation of volunteers to be issued before a Nominating and Recall Committee 
		Chair has been named by the Internet Society President.
	</t>
</abstract>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

	<t>The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), 
		and at-large IETF representatives to the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) are 
		selected by a "Nominating and Recall Committee" (universally abbreviated as "NomCom").
		<xref target='RFC3777' /> defines how the NomCom is selected, and the processes it follows as
		it selects candidates for these positions.
	</t>

	<t>This document describes an issue with <xref target='RFC3777' /> that has arisen in practice, and 
		proposes a normative update to resolve the issue.
	</t>

</section>

<section anchor="background" title="Background of this document" >

	<t><xref target='RFC3777' /> is the latest in a series of revisions to the NomCom process. 
		<xref target='RFC3777' /> has been updated once since 2004,
		but this update (<xref target='RFC5078' /> did not change normative text (it replaced a
		sample timeline).
	</t>

	<t><xref target='RFC5078' /> identified a serial delay in the process described in 
		<xref target='RFC3777' />, in section 4, 
		"Nominating Committee Selection", bullet 13, which states:
	</t>

	<t><list>
		<t>The Chair obtains the list of IESG and IAB positions to be
       			reviewed and announces it along with a solicitation for names of
       			volunteers from the IETF community willing to serve on the
       			nominating committee.
			<vspace blankLines='1' />

		</t>
		
		<t>The solicitation must permit the community at least 30 days
       			during which they may choose to volunteer to be selected for the
      			nominating committee.
			<vspace blankLines='1' />
		</t>
	
		<t>The list of open positions is published with the solicitation to
  			facilitate community members choosing between volunteering for an
   			open position and volunteering for the nominating committee.
		</t>
	</list></t>

	<t>The result is that the Chair is the only person who can announce the list of open positions 
		and solicitation for names
		of volunteers, a process that requires 30 days for public solicitation.

	</t>
	
	<t>Since this is the first step in 
		organizing the NomCom committee, delays in selecting a NomCom Chair translate 
		directly into delays in issuing the solicitation and organizing the NomCom.
	</t>

	<t>This proved problematic in practice in 2008-2009, when Joel Halpern was named NomCom Chair less 
		than 30 days prior to the Second IETF meeting. If the 30-day solicitation had already taken 
		place, Joel could have organized the NomCom at the Second IETF
		meeting, face to face, but since the required 30-day solicitation didn't start until Joel 
		was named, 
		Joel was forced to organize the NomCom by e-mail and conference call.
	</t>

	<t>It is desirable to allow the solicitation and announcement to take place in a timely manner 
		so that when 
		a NomCom Chair IS named, the NomCom Chair can immediately announce the source of selection
		randomness and quickly select voting volunteer members of the NomCom.
	</t>

</section>

<section anchor="discussion" title="Discussion" >

	<t>This document proposes that the IETF Secretariat, not the current NomCom Chair,
		will issue the announcement of open positions and the solicitation for
		names of volunteers on behalf of the NomCom Chair who will be named by the ISOC
		President. This allows the 
		search for NomCom Chair and volunteers to proceed in parallel.
	</t>

	<t>This process change covers only the announcement of open positions and the solicitation for names
		of volunteers. The announcement of the pool of volunteers and the source of randomness used
		to select voting volunteers
		is still the responsibility of the current Chair. The goal of this process change is 
		*not* to allow the NomCom process to move to completion without a current Chair, 
		it is only to ensure that a current Chair can begin
		organizing the NomCom without an avoidable delay, and can use face-to-face time at 
		the Second IETF meeting effectively for this purpose.
	</t>

	<t>Note: Some of the comments on version 00 of this draft asked "why isn't the solution
		just to pick the NomCom Chair sooner?" That's a reasonable question, and this proposal
		isn't intended to make NomCom Chair selection any less urgent. On the other hand, 
		the RFC 5078 timeline for 2008 recommended sending out the announcement and 
		solicitation on 2008/05/25, and Joel sent out his announcement and solicitation 
		on 2008/07/15 - nearly two months later. If that's a one-time occurrance, 
		obviously this proposal isn't necessary. On the other hand, the RFC 5078 dates
		are almost exactly the same in 2009-2010, so we'll know if there's a problem
		by 2009-05-24... :-|
	</t>

	<t>Note: Some of the comments on version 00 of this draft talked about a "slippery slope" - 
		how far can the NomCom process go without a NomCom Chair? Although it may make sense to
		assign additional administrative responsibilities to the IETF Secretariat (for 
		example, publish a timeline or publish a mechanism for 
		random selection of voting NomCom members), I've resisted
		proposing these changes, simply to limit the scope of changes to the NomCom process.
