        <abstract>
        <t>This document specifies a value for the extendedKeyUsage X.509
        extension that may be used to create a certificate that would be
        used to sign attribute assertions. This allows the differentiation
        of certificates used to identify a particular server (which would
        have a serverAuth EKU), from the certificate used by that server to
        sign attribute assertions, and would easily allow a policy to be
        developed for issuance of such a certificate to an identity provider.</t>

        <section title="Introduction">
	
	<t><xref target="RFC5280"/> defines the extendedKeyUsage X.509
        extension for the PKIX Internet Certificate Profile.  This document
        extends that definition, and defines a new value for
        extendedKeyUsage (id-kp-assertionSigning) which allows for a relying
        party to know that the holder of the Certificate has been certified
        according to the Issuing Certification Authority's (CA) requirements
        for a provider of attribute information.</t>
        
        <t>This value MAY be used instead of requiring a dedicated
        Federation Enabler Certification Authority for issuing certificates
        to Identity Providers or Attribute Providers in a WS-Fed or SAML
        federation.  A conformant CA MAY set up a particular Certificate
        Profile which is only issued after ensuring that the subject of the
        certificate is operating according to a given set of guidelines, as
        established by a given federation.  By including this
        extendedKeyUsage, a conformant CA can distinguish certificates
        issued to an Identity Provider or Attribute Provider as distinct
        from any other certificates issued to devices such as web servers,
        etc.  A Relying Party MAY use this to be certain that the presenter
        of the certificate containing this is an authorised Identity
        Provider within a given federation.  Federation Realm determination
        is out of scope of this document.</t>
	
	<t>If id-kp-assertionSigning is declared in extendedKeyUsage, then
	no other extendedKeyUsage values SHOULD be set.  If
	id-kp-assertionSigning is declared in extendedKeyUsage, a conformant
	CA SHALL set the digitalSignature bit in the keyUsage extension.  A
	conformant CA MAY also set the nonRepudiation bit of the keyUsage
	extension.  A conformation CA SHOULD NOT set the keyEncipherment,
	keyAgreement, or dataEncipherment bits in keyUsage.  The Certificate
	MUST NOT have crlSign, or certSign bits set in keyUsage.</t>
        
        <t>Certificates with this bit set SHOULD NOT be used as the primary
        identity certificate for the identity provider (e.g.: Should not be
        the same Certificate as used for SSL Authentication).</t>

                <t>This memo defines a new value 'id-kp-assertionSigning' to
