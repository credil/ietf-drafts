     Abstract 

        RBridges are link layer (L2) devices that use routing protocols 
        as a control plane. They combine several of the benefits of the 
        link layer with network layer routing benefits. RBridges may use 
        existing link state routing (without requiring configuration) to 
        improve RBridge to RBridge aggregate throughput. RBridges also

        provide support for IP multicast and IP address resolution 
        optimizations. They are intended to be applicable to similar L2 
        network sizes as conventional bridges and are intended to be 
        backward compatible with those bridges as both ingress/egress 
        and transit. They also support VLANs (although this generally 
        requires configuration) and otherwise attempt to retain as much 
        'plug and play' as is already available in existing bridges. 
        There has been a lot of discussion within the TRILL working 
        group about the potential for scaling issues when using IS-IS in 
        combination with (possibly as many as 4K) VLANs. This document 
        is intended to provide information on potential scaling issues 
        and the possible solutions that may be applied in deploying 
        RBridges.

     Internet-Draft       Scaling RBridge Deployments      November 2007 
         

      Introduction 

        This document describes issues with, and potential solutions 
        for, scaling deployments of RBridge standard implementations in 
        combination with standard VLANs. 

     1.1. Terminology 

        The following terminology is used, as described in this section, 
        throughout this document. 

        o  IS-IS: Intermediate System to Intermediate System routing 
           protocol. See [2] for further information on IS-IS. 

        o  LAN: Local Area Network, is a computer network covering a 
           small geographic area, like a home, office, or group of 
           buildings, e.g., as based on IEEE 802.3 technology, see also 
           IEEE 802.1Q-2005, Section 3.11 [3]. 

        o  Spanning Tree Protocol (STP): an Ethernet (802.1D) protocol 
           for establishing and maintaining a single spanning tree among 
           all the bridges on a local Ethernet segment. Also, Rapid 
           Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP). In this document, STP and RSTP 
           are considered to be the same. 

        o  SPF: Shortest Path First - an algorithm name associated with 
           routing, used to determine a shortest path graph traversal. 

        o  TRILL: Transparent Interconnect over Lots of Links - the 
           working group and working name for the problem domain to be 
           addressed in this document. 

        o  VLAN: Virtual Local Area Network, see IEEE 802.1Q-2005 [3]. 

        o  Adjacent RBridges: RBridges that communicate directly with 
           each other without relay through other RBridges.  

        o  Designated RBridge (DR): the RBridge that is elected to 
           handle ingress and egress traffic to a particular Ethernet 
           link having shared access among multiple RBridges; that 
           RBridge is such a link's "Designated RBridge". The Designated 
           RBridge is determined by an election process among those 
           RBridges having shared access via a single LAN.

        o  Edge RBridge (edge of a TRILL Campus): describes RBridges 
           that serve to ingress frames into the TRILL Campus and egress 
           frames from the TRILL Campus. L2 frames transiting an TRILL 
           Campus enter, and leave, it via an edge RBridge. 

        o  Peer RBridge: The term "Peer RBridge", or (where usage is not 
           ambiguous) the term "Peer", are used in the RBridge context 
           to refer to any of the RBridges that make up a TRILL campus. 

        o  RBridge: a logical device as described in this document, 
           which incorporate both routing and bridging features, thus 
           allowing for the achievement of TRILL Architecture goals. A 
           single RBridge device which can cooperate with other RBridge 
           devices to create a TRILL Campus.  

        o  TRILL Campus: this term, or the term "Campus" (where usage is 
           not ambiguous) is used in the RBridge context to refer to the 
           set of cooperating RBridges and TRILL Links that connect them 
           to each other. 

        o  TRILL Link: this term, or the term "Link" (where its usage is 
           not ambiguous) is used in the RBridge context to refer to the 
           Layer 2 connection that exists either between RBridges, or 
           between an RBridge and Ethernet end stations.
