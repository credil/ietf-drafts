      <t>
	RFC documents contain a number of fixed elements such as the
	title page header, standard boilerplates and copyright/IPR
	statements.  This document describes them and introduces some
	updates to reflect current usage and requirements of RFC
	publication.  In particular, this updated structure is
	intended to communicate clearly the source of RFC creation and
	review.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	Previously RFCs (e.g. <xref target="RFC4844" />) contained a
	number of elements that were there for historical, practical,
	and legal reasons. They also contained boilerplate material to
	clearly indicate the status of the document and possibly
	contained "Notes" to indicate how the document interacts with
	IETF Standards-Track documents.
	
      </t>
      <t>
	As the RFC Series has evolved over the years, there has been
	increasing concern over appropriate labelling of the
	publications to make clear the status of each RFC and the
	status of the work it describes.  Chiefly, there is a
	requirement that RFCs published as part of the IETF's review
	process not be easily confused with RFCs that may have had a
	very different review and approval process.  Various
	adjustments have been made over the years, including evolving
	text of "Notes" included in the published RFC.
      </t>
      <t>
	With the definition of the different RFC streams <xref
	target="RFC4844"/> it is appropriate to formalize the
	definition of the various pieces of standard RFC boilerplate
	and introduce some adjustments to ensure better clarity of
	expression of document status, aligned with the review and
	approval processes defined for each stream.
      </t>
      
      <t>
	This memo identifies and describes the common elements of RFC
	boilerplate structure, and provides a comprehensive approach
	to updating and using those elements to communicate, with
	clarity, RFC document and content status.  Most of the
	historical structure information is collected from <xref
	target="RFC2223"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
	The changes introduced by this memo should be implemented as 
	soon as practically possible after the document has been 
	approved for publication.

    <section anchor="standards" title="RFC Streams and Internet Standards">
      <t>
	Users of RFCs should be aware that while all Internet
	standards-related documents are published as RFCs, not all
	RFCs are Internet standards-related documents.
      </t>
      
      <t>
	The IETF is responsible for maintaining the Internet Standards
	Process, which includes the requirements for developing,
	reviewing and approving Standards Track and BCP RFCs.  These,
	and any other standards-related documents (Informational or
	Experimental) are reviewed by appropriate IETF bodies and
	published as part of the IETF Stream.
      </t>
      <t>
	Documents published in streams other than the IETF Stream are
	not reviewed by the IETF for such things as security,
	congestion control, or inappropriate interaction with deployed
	protocols.  They have also not been subject to approval by the
	Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), including an
	IETF-wide last call.  Therefore, the IETF disclaims, for any
	of the non-IETF Stream documents, any knowledge of the fitness
	of those RFCs for any purpose.
      </t>
      
      <t>
	Refer to <xref target="RFC2026"/>, <xref
	target="I-D.housley-iesg-rfc3932bis"/>, and <xref target="RFC4844"/> and their
	successors for current details of the IETF process and RFC
	streams.

	<t> 
	  The right column contains author name and affiliation
	  information as well as RFC publication date.  Conventions
	  and restrictions for these elements are described in RFC
	  style norms and some individual stream definitions.
	</t>
	<t>
	  This section is primarily concerned with the information in
	  the left column:
	</t>
	<t>
	  <list style="hanging">
	    
	    <t hangText="&lt;document source&gt;"> 
	      This describes the area where the work originates.
	      Historically, all RFCs were labeled Network Working
	      Group. "Network Working Group" refers to the original
	      version of today's IETF when people from the original
	      set of ARPANET sites and whomever else was interested --
	      the meetings were open -- got together to discuss,
	      design and document proposed protocols <xref
	      target='RFC0003'/>. Here, we obsolete the term "Network
	      Working Group" in order to indicate the originating
	      stream.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The &lt;document source&gt; is the name of the RFC
	      stream, as defined in <xref target="RFC4844"/> and its
	      successors.  At the time of this publication, the
	      streams, and therefore the possible entries are:
	      <list style='symbols'>
		<t>Internet Engineering Task Force</t> 
		<t>Internet Architecture Board</t> 
		<t>Internet Research Task Force</t>
		<t>Independent</t>
	      </list>
	      
	    </t>
	    
	    <t hangText="Request for Comments:  &lt;RFC number&gt;">
	      This indicates the RFC number, assigned by the RFC
	      Editor upon publication of the document.  This element
	      is unchanged.
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="&lt;subseries ID&gt; &lt;subseries number&gt;"> 
	      Some document categories are also labeled as a subseries
	      of RFCs.  These elements appear as appropriate for such
	      categories, indicating the subseries and the documents
	      number within that series.  Currently, there are
	      subseries for BCPs <xref target="RFC2026"/>, STDs<xref
	      target="RFC1311"/>, and FYIs <xref target="RFC1150"/>.
	      These subseries numbers may appear in several RFCs.  For
	      example, when a new RFC obsoletes or updates an old one,
	      the same subseries number is used.  Also, several RFCs
	      may be assigned the same subseries number: a single STD,
	      for example, may be composed of several RFCs, each of
	      which will bear the same STD number.  This element is
	      unchanged.
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="[&lt;RFC relation&gt;:&lt;RFC number[s]&gt;]"> 
	      Some relations between RFCs in the series are explicitly
	      noted in the RFC header.  For example, a new RFC may
	      update one or more earlier RFCs.  Currently two
	      relationships are defined: "Updates", and "Obsoletes"
	      <xref target="RFC2223"/>. Variants like "Obsoleted by"
	      are also used (e.g in <xref target="RFC5143"/>).  Other
	      types of relations may be defined elsewhere.
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="Category: &lt;category&gt;">
	      This indicates the initial RFC document category of the
	      publication.  These are defined in <xref
	      target="RFC2026"/>.  Currently, this is always one of:
	      Standards Track, Best Current Practice, Experimental,
	      Informational, or Historic.  This element is unchanged.

      <section anchor="Status" title="The Status of this Memo">
	<t>
	  The "Status of This Memo" describes the category of the RFC,
	  including the distribution statement.  This text is included
	  irrespective of the source stream of the RFC.
	</t>
	
	<t>
	  From now on, the "Status of This Memo" will start with a
	  single sentence describing the status. It will also include a
	  statement describing the stream-specific review of the
	  material (which is stream-dependent).  This is an important
	  component of status, insofar as it clarifies the breadth and
	  depth of review, and gives the reader an understanding of
	  how to consider its content.
	</t>
	
	<t>
	  The first paragraph of the Status of this Memo section
	  contains a single sentence, clearly standing out. It depends on
	  the category of the document.
	  <list>
	    <t hangText="For 'Standards Track' documents:" >
	      This memo is an Internet Standards Track document.
	    </t>
	    
	    <t hangText="For 'Best Current Practices' documents:" >
	      This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice
	    </t>
	    
	    <t hangText="For other categories" >
	      This memo is not an Internet Standards Track
	      specification,  &lt;it is published for other
	      purposes&gt;.
	    </t>
	  </list>
	  
	  For Informational, Experimental, Historic and future
	  categories of RFCs, the RFC editor will maintain an
	  appropriate text for &lt;it is published for other
	  purposes&gt;. For example, with an Informational document
	  this could read "it is published for informational
	  purposes".
	</t>
	
	
	
	
	<t>
	  The second paragraph contains text as follows that is
	  specific to the initial category:

	  <list style='hanging'>
	    
	    <t hangText="Standards Track:">
	      "This document specifies an Internet standards track
	      protocol for the Internet community. Please see the
	      "Updates to the RFC" section of this document for 
	      information on where to find the status of this document 
	      and the availability of errata for this memo."
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="Best Current Practice:">
	      "This document specifies an Internet Best Current
	      Practices for the Internet Community.  Please see the
	      "Updates to the RFC" section of this document for 
	      information on where to find the status of this 
	      document and the availability of errata for this memo."
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="Experimental:">
	      "This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the
	      Internet community.  This memo does not specify an
	      Internet standard of any kind.  Discussion and
	      suggestions for improvement are requested."
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="Informational:">
	      
	      "This memo provides information for the Internet
	      community.  This memo does not specify an Internet
	      standard of any kind. "
	    </t>

	    <t hangText="Historic:">
	      "This memo defines a Historic Document for the Internet
	      community.  It does not specify an Internet standard of
	      any kind."
	    </t>
	  </list>
	</t>


	<t>
	  Note that the texts in paragraph 1 and 2 of the boilerplate
	  indicate the initial status of a document. During their
	  lifetime documents can change status to e.g. Historic. This
	  cannot be reflected in the document itself and will need be
	  reflected in the information refered to in <xref
	  target="Structure"/>.
	</t>


	<t>
	  The third paragraph of the "Status of This Memo" will now
	  include a paragraph describing the type of review and
	  exposure the document has received.  This is defined on a
	  per-stream basis.  From now on, these paragraphs will be
	  defined as part of RFC stream definitions.	  
	</t>
	<t>
	  The following texts may be updated if the stream definitions
	  are updated, but initial paragraphs for the existing streams are:
	  <list style='hanging'>
	    <t hangText="IETF Stream:">
	      "This document is a product of the Internet Engineering
	      Task Force (IETF). "
	    </t>
	   <t> If there has been an IETF consensus call per IETF 
	   process, an additional sentence should be added: "This 
	   document represents a consensus of the IETF community.  
	   It has received public review and has been approved for 
	   publication by the Internet Engineering Steering Group."
	    </t>

<abstract>
<t>IETF procedures generally require that a standards track RFC may not have a normative reference to another standards track document at a lower maturity level or to a non standards track specification (other than specifications from other standards bodies).  For example, a standards track document may not have a normative reference to an informational RFC.  Exceptions to this rule are sometimes needed as the IETF uses informational RFCs to describe non-IETF standards or IETF-specific modes of use of such standards.  This document clarifies and updates the procedure used in these circumstances.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>The IETF policies about Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), such as patent rights, relative to technologies developed in the IETF are designed to ensure that IETF working groups and participants have as much information about any IPR constraints on a technical proposal as possible.  The policies are also intended to benefit the Internet community and the public at large, while respecting the legitimate rights of IPR holders.  This memo details the IETF policies concerning IPR related to technology worked on within the IETF.  It also describes the objectives that the policies are designed to meet.  This memo updates RFC 2026 and, with RFC 3978, replaces Section 10 of RFC 2026.  This memo also updates paragraph 4 of Section 3.2 of RFC 2028, for all purposes, including reference [2] in RFC 2418.

	  Fixed the header so it appropriately shows that the document

	</t>
	<t>
	  Introduced the "Other structural information in RFCs"
	  section and moved the ISSN number from the front matter to
	  this section. The "Other structural information in RFCs"
	  intends to give very rough guidance providing the RFC editor
	  with sufficient freedom to move pieces around and edit them to
	  please the eye and mind.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Modified the last sentence 3rd paragraph of the Status of
	  this memo section for the IRTF Stream in accordance to a
	  suggestion by Aaron Falk; Indicating that review happened by
	  the IRSG and not indicating that review did not happen by
	  the IESG.
	</t>
	<t> Introduced the square brackets around the &lt;author
	affiliation&gt; in the header. To highlight this is an
	optional element.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The definition of the "Clarifies" relation has been taken
	  out.  There are arguments that introducing the relation
	  needs a bit more thought and is better done by a separate
	  document. 
	</t>
	<t>
	  Provided the RFC Editor with responsibility to maintain
	  several text pieces.

	<t>
	  In <xref target="Status"/> some modifications were applied

	<t>
	  The &lt;description&gt; contains the full name of the

	<t>
	  RFC2223 and 4844 moved to the informative reference
