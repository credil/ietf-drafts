Abstract

   IETF procedure requires country-specific cryptographic transforms to
   be Informational RFCs.  This document allows such Informational RFCs
   to be used by SRTP and SRTP Security Descriptions.

Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Status of this Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that
   other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-
   Drafts.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any

Internet-Draft   Policy for Registering SRTP Transforms     January 2010


1.  Introduction

   It is desirable to extend SRTP and its keying mechanisms to support
   country-specific cryptographic transforms.  This document resolves a
   clash between IETF procedure and existing RFCs.  IETF procedure
   requires that country-specific cryptographic transforms be published
   as Informational RFCs [[citation needed]], but existing documents
   require extensions to SRTP and extensions to SRTP keying to be
   published as Standards-Track RFCs.

   The IANA Considerations section of this document resolves this clash
   by allowing Informational RFCs to register new cryptographic
   transforms.


2.  Security Considerations

   This specification makes it easier for new cryptographic transforms
   to be used with SRTP.  However, this specifications does not lift the
   requirement that cryptographic transforms is subject to IETF Review
   to ensure their appropriateness and level of security.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates Section 6 and 12 of [RFC3711] and Section
   10.3.2.1 of [RFC4568].  The update of [RFC4568] also updates the
   requirements to register a new SRTP Crypto Suite at [SDESC].

   After publication of this document, new SRTP cryptographic transforms
   MUST be allocated by IANA using the "IETF Review" policy of [RFC5226]
   using either Informational or Standards-track RFCs.
