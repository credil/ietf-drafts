Abstract

   The MPLS-Ping is for detecting data path failure. This draft suggests
   an extension to MPLS-Ping so that transit LSR can indicate the
   downstream link impairment condition to the source LSR.

1. Motivation

   MPLS-Ping [MPLS-Ping] can be used to detect faults along the LSP
   path. One of the faults detected by MPLS-Ping is downstream link
   failure, i.e. link connectivity being down. In some network
   environment, source node also needs to know the condition of the link
   on which the LSPs are carried even though the link connectivity is
   up.  That way the source LSR can perform needed functions, such as
   enforcing admission control, re-signal and/or re-compute the LSP

   path, or generate more stringent performance monitoring at shorter
   interval, and etc.

   A common example for the link condition change is the bandwidth
   fluctuation in Mobile Backhaul network, where Microwave transport is
   widely deployed. Most Microwave transport nodes adjust its bandwidth
   based on the weather. Even though there is RSVP-TE for individual
   links to advertise its available bandwidth in the routing domain,
   end-to-end bandwidth change may not be possible in some Mobile
   Backhaul environment, because there may be multiple routing domains
   from base stations to MSO. If Source Nodes, i.e. LTE's eNodeB or
   MSO's RNC, are aware of the bandwidth change, they can adjust
   services accordingly, request other base stations to accept new
   calls, or trigger a new Performance Monitoring scheme to track the
   condition more closely.

   In another application, source LSRs may want to be aware of the
   congestion along the LSP path, so that proper actions can be taken.
   MPLS-ECN (RFC 5129) specifies a mechanism for transit nodes to mark
   EXP bits when congestion happens. However, many deployed MPLS
   networks already use EXP bits to mark packet priorities, making MPLS-
   ECN (RFC 5129) mechanism un-usable for the purpose of LSP change
   indication.

   In a third application, source LSRs may want to be aware of
   significant performance degradation on the downstream links along the
   LSP path.  The performance degradation can be increased latency
   and/or increased delay variation.  Those performance degradations may
   be induced by the physical layer protection scheme, such as link
   switching from active side of the ring to protect side of the ring,
   or it may be induced by transmission media degradation.

   In a forth application, source LSRs may want to be aware of transport
   media change on the downstream links along the LSP path.  For
   example, the link can be a fiber protected by microwave, and the
   source router may be carrying an application that cannot use
   microwave due to security concerns.

   This draft suggests adding a new sub-TLV to the MPLS Ping Echo Reply
   for the transit LSR to indicate the downstream link condition changes
   to source routers.

2. MPLS-Ping extension for path condition impairment indication

   [MPLS-Ping] specified that replying router for MPLS Ping should
   include one Downstream Mapping for each interface, over which this
   FEC could be forwarded, in the Echo Reply.  [MPLS-Ping-Enhanced] has

Internet-Draft    Path Condition Marking using BFD       February 2010


   introduced 3 types of sub-TLV to the Downstream Detailed Mapping,
   Multipath data, Label stack, and FEC Stack change.

   This draft suggests adding a new sub-TLV "Downstream Link Condition"
   to indicate the condition of the downstream link of the corresponding
   interface. The "Downstream Path Condition" could be bandwidth being
   reduced, the interface being congested, etc.

     Sub-Type   Value Field
   --------       --------
     TBD      Multipath data (specified by [MPLS-Ping-Enhanced])
     TBD      Label stack (specified by [MPLS-Ping-Enhanced])
     TBD      FEC Stack change (specified by [MPLS-Ping-Enhanced])
      TBD        Downstream Link Condition (new)


2.1. Downstream Link Condition sub-TLV

        0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

     | Type          | Length        |ImpairmentType | SeverityLevel |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+



   The Impairment Type field can take one of the following values:

     Value   Meaning
   --------    --------
     1     port towards downstream LSR is congested
     2     Bandwidth of the link towards downstream LSR is reduced
     3     performance of the link towards downstream LSR is reduced
     4        transport media of the link towards downstream LSR has
               been changed


   The Severity Level field is a value indicating the severity of the
   impairment. Network operator can set the Severity Level for
   anticipated conditions and configure the proper actions at the source
   node upon receiving the Echo Reply. For example, Severity Level 0 can
   represent full bandwidth, 1 represents the next bandwidth level, and
   6 represents the least bandwidth. For microwave transport link within
   MPLS based Mobile Backhaul network, the Adaptive Modulation usually
   has several levels of adjusted bandwidth, which can be used as the
   basis for setting the Severity Level.

2.2. Link Condition Request in Echo Request

   If a source LSR of a LSP cannot do anything when the LSP path is
   impaired, then there is no point for the transit LSR to send any link
   condition in the Echo Reply to the sender. Therefore, it is necessary
   for the sender to indicate if it desires to receive the Downstream
   Link Condition status in the Echo Reply. This draft suggests using
   one reserved bit of DS flags in the Echo Request for the source node
   to indicate if it desires to receive the impairment condition of the
   downstream link on a transit LSR.

   DS Flags

     RFC4379 already defines I bit and N bit out of the octet DS Flags.
     This draft suggests adding a new bit C for source LSR to indicate
     if it desires to have the link impairment condition to be reported
     by transit LSR in the Echo Reply.

     The DS flags field is a bit vector with the following format:

          0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Internet-Draft    Path Condition Marking using BFD       February 2010


         |Rsvd(MBZ)|C|I|N|
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


     I and N flags are already specified by RFC 4379. The C flag is
     defined as follow:

      Flag  Name and Meaning
       -----   ----------------
       C     Source LSR desires to know the downstream link condition

     When this flag is set (C = 1), it indicates that the replying
     router SHOULD include the downstream link condition sub-TLV in the
     echo reply message. When this flag is not set (C=0), it indicates
     that the source LSR doesn't need downstream path condition
     information, so replying router SHOULD NOT include the downstream
     link condition sub-TLV in the echo reply.

2.3. Receiving Echo Request with a Path Condition Request flag set

     If the DS flags' C is set, the receiving LSRs HAVE TO construct the
     Downstream Link Condition sub-TLV and insert it into the Echo
     Reply.

3. Receiving Path Condition Impairment Notification

   Though it is out of the scope of this draft on what Source LSR will
   do upon receiving the Path Condition in the Echo Reply, here are some
   examples of possible actions Source LSR could do:

       trigger more stringent performance monitoring in shorter
        interval to measure the quality of the path

       re-adjust load balancing among the multiple paths from Source
        LSR to the Destination LSR

       Re-signal LSP to alternative path

       activate the secondary/protection path

       adjust admission rate (in the case of LTE eNodeB)

       Notify adjacent client device via E-LMI, IEEE802.3ah, or simple
        flow control.

4. Manageability Considerations

   This document does not add additional manageability considerations.

5. Security Considerations

   This document has no additional requirement for a change to the
   security models of MPLS-Ping and MPLS-Ping-Enhanced.

6. IANA Considerations

   A future revision of this document will present requests to IANA for
