Internet-Draft                  TURN URIs                      July 2011


1.  Introduction

   [RFC5928] defines a resolution mechanism to convert a secure flag, an
   host name or IP address, a eventually empty port, and an eventually
   empty transport to a list of IP address, port, and TURN transport
   tuples.

   To simplify the provisioning of TURN clients, this document defines a
   TURN and a TURNS URI scheme that can carry the four components needed
   for the resolution mechanism.


2.  Syntax of a TURN or TURNS URI

   A TURN/TURNS URI has the following ABNF syntax [RFC5234]:

   turnURI       = scheme ":" turn-host [ ":" turn-port ]
                 [ "?transport=" transport ]
   scheme        = "turn" / "turns"
   transport     = "udp" / "tcp" / transport-ext
   transport-ext = 1*unreserved
   turn-host     = IP-literal / IPv4address / reg-name
   turn-port     = *DIGIT
   IP-literal    = "[" ( IPv6address / IPvFuture  ) "]"
   IPvFuture     = "v" 1*HEXDIG "." 1*( unreserved / sub-delims / ":" )
   IPv6address   =                            6( h16 ":" ) ls32
                 /                       "::" 5( h16 ":" ) ls32
                 / [               h16 ] "::" 4( h16 ":" ) ls32
                 / [ *1( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::" 3( h16 ":" ) ls32
                 / [ *2( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::" 2( h16 ":" ) ls32
                 / [ *3( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"    h16 ":"   ls32
                 / [ *4( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"              ls32
                 / [ *5( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"              h16
                 / [ *6( h16 ":" ) h16 ] "::"
   h16           = 1*4HEXDIG
   ls32          = ( h16 ":" h16 ) / IPv4address
   IPv4address   = dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet
   dec-octet     = DIGIT                 ; 0-9
                 / %x31-39 DIGIT         ; 10-99
                 / "1" 2DIGIT            ; 100-199
                 / "2" %x30-34 DIGIT     ; 200-249
                 / "25" %x30-35          ; 250-255
   reg-name      = *( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims )

   <unreserved>, <sub-delims>, and <pct-encoded> are specified in
   [RFC3986].

   <secure> is equal to false is <scheme> is equal to "turn" and equal

   to false if <scheme> is equal to "turns".


3.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for the resolution mechanism are discussed in
   [RFC5928].

   The "turn" and "turns" URI schemes do not introduce any specific
   security issues beyond the security considerations discussed in
   [RFC3986].


4.  IANA Considerations

   This section contains the registration information for the "turn" and
   "turns" URI Schemes (in accordance with [RFC4395]).

4.1.  TURN URI Registration

   URI scheme name: turn

   Status: permanent

   URI scheme syntax: See Section 2.

   URI scheme semantics: See [RFC5928].

   Encoding considerations: There are no encoding considerations beyond
   those in [RFC3986].

   Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme name:

      The "turn" URI scheme is intended to be used by applications that
      might need access to a TURN server.

   Interoperability considerations: N/A

   Security considerations: See Section 3.

4.2.  TURNS URI Registration

   URI scheme name: turns

   Status: permanent

   URI scheme syntax: See Section 2.

   URI scheme semantics: See [RFC5928].

   Encoding considerations: There are no encoding considerations beyond
   those in [RFC3986].

   Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme name:

      The "turns" URI scheme is intended to be used by applications that
      might need access to a TURN server.
