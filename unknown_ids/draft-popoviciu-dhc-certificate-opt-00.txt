Abstract

   The Certificate options for DHCP-PD RFC3633 [4] provide a mechanism
   to deliver, along with the IPv6 prefix, the certificate or the
   information needed to obtain a certificate entitling the client
   router to advertise the prefix delegated to it.  This information is
   neccesary if Secure Neighbor Discovery RFC3971 [6] is used by the
   devices connected to the DHCP-PD client router.

Internet-Draft      DHCP Certificate Delivery Option       November 2007


1.  Introduction

   The Prefix Delegation capabilities of Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol (DHCP) offer a convenient mechanism to dynamically provision
   a router and enable it to, in turn, provision the devices connected
   to it.  In the context of Secure Neighbor Discovery however, a router
   must posses a digital certificate provided by a Certificate Authority
   for the prefixes it advertises through Router Advertisements.  In
   this scenario, a receiving router needs to acquire the certificate
   for the prefixes received via DHCP-PD.

   This document describes new options for DHCP which enable or
   facilitate the dynamic acquisition and management of certificates by
   DHCP-PD clients for the prefixes delegated to them.  For example,
   these options will be used by a Customer Premises Equipment(CPE)
   router acting as the gateway between a subscriber's network and the
   service provider network.

   The mechanisms described in this document do not require
   authentication or security enhancements to the existing DHCPv6
   specification RFC3315 [3] or the DHCP-PD specification RFC3633.


2.  Definitions and Terminology

   For a complete specification of the options defined, this document
   should be read in conjunction with the DHCPv6 (RFC3315) and DHCP-PD
   (RFC3633) specifications.  Definitions for terms and acronyms not
   explicitly detailed in this document can be found in RFC3315 .

   This document uses the terminology defined in RFC2460 [2], RFC3315
   and RFC3971.

   This document also relies on the terminology and concepts defined in
   RFC3779 [5] and RFC4211 [8], as well as the framework defined in
   RFC4210 [7].


3.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1].
   RFC 2119 defines the use of these key words to help make the intent
   of standards track documents as clear as possible.  While this
   document uses these keywords, this document is not a standards track
   document.

Internet-Draft      DHCP Certificate Delivery Option       November 2007


4.  Model and Applicability

   The environment in which the certificate DHCP options can be used is
   similar to the typical DHCP-PD deployment environment and is shown in
   Figure 1.  A DHCP server which can be located on the Aggregation
   device or somewhere in the ISP network, provides a prefix to the
   requesting router.  The requesting router subnets the prefix into /64
   prefixes which it assigns to its own, subscriber facing interfaces.
   It then advertises the /64 prefixes through RAs to enable hosts to
   autoprovisioning themselves.

   If the subscriber hosts are implementing SEND (RFC3971 and RFC3872),
   the CPE will have to use CryptoGraphic Addresses (CGA) to peer with
   them.  These addresses will be derived from an RSA key pair public/
   private.  Before accepting the /64 prefix advertised by the CPE, the
   hosts will require a certificate from the CPE, for the advertised
   prefix.  The CPE will have to acquire a certificate corresponding to
   its public key, including the prefix delegated to it, using X.509
   extensions for IP addresses (RFC3779) A Certificate Authority (CA)
   will provide the certificate which the CPE can use to confirm that it
   is allowed to advertise the /64 subnets over its subscriber facing
   interface via router advertisements.

   Figure 1 illustrates a deployment scenario which benefits form the
   certificate options of DHCP.

                        Figure 1


   In the environment described in Figure 1, the delegating server can
   be either the aggregating device (the gateway for the requesting
   router) or a DHCP server under the management of the service provider
   and located somewhere within its network.

   While there are several mechanisms by which the CPE can acquire the
   certificate (manual provisioning, using a File System, SCEP, PKCS12,
   HTTP or using Self-Signed certificates), their use would imply a less
   dynamic CPE provisioning mechanism and additional control plane
   functions needed by the CA to learn and maintain the state of
   prefixes allocated by the DHCP-PD server.  Alternatively, the
   distribution of the certificate can be facilitated by the DHCP-PD
   server along with the process of delegating the prefix which has to
   be certified.

   With the DHCP certificate options, the DHCP-PD server can offer, upon
   request, to intermediate the process of acquiring a certificate or to
   provide the information needed by the CPE to acquire the certificate
   through an alternative mechanism.  Since CPE's clients can require

   certificates originated in various certificate authorities, the
   services requested and offered through this option must be related to
   a certification chain trust anchor RFC4210 [7].

   A DHCP server which ends up facilitating the certificate acquisition
   (and not just providing a pointer) can be seen to be similar to the
   Registration Authority (RA) entity described in RFC4210.


5.  Identity Association for Prefix Delegation

   In the context of DHCP facilitated certificate distribution, the
   requesting router and the delegating server use the Identity
   Association for Prefix Delegation (IA_PD) described in RFC3633 to
   identify, group and manage the delegated prefixes.  The IA_PD option
   code is 25, the IAID is 4 octets and the T1, T2 timers are used to
   manage the communication between the requesting router and the
   delegating server as described in section 9 of RFC3633.  Operational
   status information is exchanged via Status Code options.

   The certificate is related to a delegated prefix or to all delegated
   prefixes.  The new option called "Certificate Option" (CO) is defined
   for the IA_PD to enable the requesting router and the delegating
   server to identify and manage the certificates corresponding to
   delegated prefixes.

   The option can appear multiple times in the DHCP messages.  It must
   provide the resources to indicate what type of assistance is needed
   or can be provided in the process of acquiring a certificate.  In
   certain circumstances a full certificate is requested from the DHCP
   server while in other a pointer (IP address of FQDN) to the
   certificate server is sufficient.

   The process of facilitating the acquisition of a certificate requires
   the CO option to carry various information types between the DHCP
   client and the DHCP server.  The option can be used to inform the
   client or the server of a preferred Trust Anchor for the certificate
   chain.  It can be used by the client to provide its public key to the
   DHCP server which in turn uses it to obtain the certificate.  The
   server uses the option to deliver a certificate to the client or to
   provide a pointer (IP address or FQDN) to a Certificate server.

   Note: In the case where the DHCP server provides a certificate to the
   client, one certificate can be built for each prefix under the IA_PD
   or a single certificate can be built for all prefixes under the
   IA_PD.

   The format of the CO option is shown in Figure 2.

6.  Mode of Operation Overview

   The mode of operation described in Sections 11, 12 and 13 of RFC3633
   remain unchanged in the context of certificate management.
   Additional information however will be exchanged between the
   requesting router and the delegating server to indicate interest in a

Internet-Draft      DHCP Certificate Delivery Option       November 2007


   certificate, to advertise the ability to facilitate the acquisition
   of a certificate and to exchange certificate related information.

   Sections 11, 12 and 13 of RFC3633 should be read in conjunction with
   the subsequent sections of this document for a complete understanding
   of DHCP's mode of operation in the context of managing certificates.


7.  Delegating Server Solicitation

   In the process of discovering a prefix delegating router, the
   requesting router can choose to indicate interest in a server with
   the capability to facilitate the acquisition of a certificate and it
   can select a server based on its level of support for managing
   certificates.

7.1.  Requesting Router Behavior

   The requesting router creates and transmits a Solicit message with a
   IA_PD option as described in section 11.1 of RFC3633.  To indicate
   interest in certificate related information, the requesting router
   includes a CO-option which can contain the following information:
   o  It sets the C flag bits to indicate the level of assistance it
      wants: any, pointer, certificate or both pointer and certificate
   o  In the payload it can include the certificate chain trust anchor
      of interest in which case the P flag bits are set to 00.
      Otherwise the payload is set to all zeros

   The requesting router processes any received Advertise messages as
   described in Section 11.1 of RFC3633.  The requesting router selects
   an advertising server based on the level of service offered for
   certificate management and the provisioning requirements of the
   requesting router.  Since the delegating server is required to
   advertise its full capabilities related to certificate management,
   the requesting router must select a server which will be able to
   provide the information requested through the follow up Request
   message described in Section 8.1.

   Should a requesting router receive no Advertisements from servers
   with the certificate management capabilities needed, the requesting
   router SHOULD default to the lowest level of support which might be
   simple prefix delegation with no certificate management assistance.
   In this situation, the requesting router will rely on other
   mechanisms to acquire its certificates should they be needed.

Internet-Draft      DHCP Certificate Delivery Option       November 2007


7.2.  Delegating Server Behavior

   In response to a Solicit message containing an IA_PD option, the
   delegating server MUST include in its Advertise message described in
   section 11.2 of RFC3633 the CO-option to indicate its capabilities of
   supporting the certificate management process for the prefixes it
   delegates.

   The certificate management services offered by the delegating server
   can be advertised for each certificate chain trust anchor for which
   the server can facilitate the process of acquiring a certificate.
   One CO option will be included for each certificate trust anchor with
   the following settings:
   o  The C flag bits are set to indicate servers capabilities for a
      given certificate trust anchor: any, pointer, certificate or both
      pointer and certificate
   o  P flag is set to 00 and the payload contains the identifier for
      the certificate chain trust anchor


8.  Requesting Router Initiated Prefix and Certificate Delegation

   A requesting router uses the same messages described in Section 12 of
   RFC3633 to populate the IA_PD with prefixes.  Additionally, it can
   acquire a certificate for the delegated prefixes or a locator for a
   certificate authority which it can later contact via other mechanisms
   to acquire a certificate.

   This section addresses environments similar to the one described in
   Figure 1 where the DHCP-PD requesting router requires a certificate
   for the delegated prefix.  The requesting router selected from
   received advertisements a delegating server which has the desired
   capabilities to support certificate management.

8.1.  Requesting Router Behavior

   To acquire the certificates, the requesting router uses the private
   key of a pair of RSA keys it previously generated independently of
   the provisioning mechanism described in this document.  After
   identifying a delegating server which has the capability to assist
   with the process of acquiring a certificate for the delegated
   prefixes and possibly a trust anchor of interest, the requesting
   router creates and transmits a Request message as described in
   section 11.2 of RFC3633.  The message is sent to the selected
   delegating sever and it contains one or more CO-options formatted in
   accordance with the capabilities of the selected server.

   If assistance can be provided in relation to multiple trust anchors,



Popoviciu, et al.         Expires May 14, 2008                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft      DHCP Certificate Delivery Option       November 2007


   the Request indicates, with the help of a CO option, which is the
   trust anchor of interest.  This CO option proceeds subsequent CO
   options that might carry additional, certificate related information
   as described in the following two cases.

   The server can provide a pointer to a certificate authority for a
   given trust anchor:
   o  The C flag is set to 01 (pointer)
   o  The P flag can be set to 00 (certificate trust anchor) and the
      payload contains the ID of the trust anchor of interest.  If the
      trust anchor is not important, the payload field can be set to all
      zeros.

   The server can provide a complete certificate for a given trust
   anchor:
      First CO option
      *  The C flag is set to 10 (certificate)
      *  The P field is set to 00 (certificate trust anchor) and the
         payload contains the ID of the trust anchor of interest.
      Second CO option
      *  The C flag is set to 10
      *  The P field is set to 01 (public key) and the payload contains
         the public key of the requesting router
   If the trust anchor is not important, then only the second CO option
   if included in the Request message.

   As described in section 12.1 of RFC3633, the requesting router might
   need verification of the information bound to the IA_PD.  The
   requesting router includes the IA_PD options in the Renew and Rebind
   messages where, along with the prefix information, it MUST include
   certificate related information according to the capabilities of the
   delegating server and optionally the trust anchor of interest.

   In the Renew/Rebind messages, the CO option has the following
   settings:
   o  The C flag is set to indicates the level of certificate assistance
      support needed
   o  The P flag is set to 00 with the payload including the trust
      anchor of interest or the payload set to all zeros should the
      trust anchor not be relevant.

   Upon the receipt of a valid Reply message for each IA_PD, a reply
   that can include either a pointer or a certificate, the requesting
   router will manage the delegated prefix as described in section 12.1.
   If a full certificate is provided, the requesting router will store
   it and use it in accordance with the recommendations of RFC3971 or
   any other related processes.  If the delegating server provided only
   the pointer to the certificate authority, the requesting router will

   use an alternative mechanism to request a certificate.

   Note that it is assumed that the requesting router does not require a
   certificate to authenticate the recommended certificate authority or
   the certificate authority which provided the certificate.  It is
   assumed that the requesting router trusts the DHCP delegating server
   the same way it trusts the server in providing the delegated prefix.

8.2.  Delegating Server Behavior

   In response to a Request message containing an IA_PD option with CO
   options, the delegating server MUST include in its Reply, along with
   the information described in section 12.2 of RFC3633, the CO-option
   containing the relevant information according to its advertised
   capabilities.

   The server can provide a pointer to a certificate server or a
   complete certificate for a given trust anchor:
      First CO option
      *  The C flag is set to the service being offered: 01 (pointer) or
         10 (certificate)
      *  The P field is set to 00 (certificate trust anchor) and the
         payload contains the ID of the trust anchor of interest.
      Second CO option
      *  The C flag is set to the service being offered: 01 (pointer) or
         10 (certificate)
      *  The P field is set to 10 (pointer) or 11 (certificate)
         depending on the service offered
   If the trust anchor is not important, then only the second CO option
   is included in the Request message.

   If the delegating server can provide a complete certificate, upon the
   receipt of the Request with the public key of the requesting router,
   the delegating server contacts a pre-provisioned certificate
   authority (which can provide certificates chained to a trust anchor
   of interest) through a mechanism outside the scope of this document.
   The server submits to the CA the certificate request tuple (ID,
   public key, delegated prefix) along with the relevant state
   maintenance timers for the delegated prefix.  The CA generates a
   certificate and sends it back to the delegating server.

   Handling of Renew and Rebind messages is dictated by the procedures
   defined in section 12.2 of RFC3633.  From the certificate maintenance
   perspective, if the delegating server identifies an active IA_PD
   binding, it will resubmit in response the location of the certificate
   authority (stateless information) or would acquire a new certificate
   and send it in response.

9.  Delegating Server Triggered Reconfiguration

   The CO option can be included in a Reconfigure message as described
   in RFC3315.  This enables the server to request a client to renew its
   certificates for an IA_PD for which it has an active biniding.  The
   triggered reconfiguration can be in relation to a given trust anchor.

   The Co option in the Reconfigure message can have the following
   format:
      First CO option
      *  The C flag is set to the service being offered: 01 (pointer) or
         10 (certificate)
      *  The P field is set to 00 (certificate trust anchor) and the
         payload contains the ID of the trust anchor of interest.
      Second CO option
      *  The C flag is set to the service being offered: 01 (pointer) or
         10 (certificate)
      *  The P field is set to 11 (certificate) and the payload set to
         all zeros
   If the trust anchor is not important, then only the second CO option
   is included in the Reconfigure message.


10.  Security Considerations

   The mechanism described in this document is subject to the same
   security considerations as the ones described in section 15 of
   RFC3633.  No additional security considerations are necessary.

   Note: Through its binding to the IA_PD, the certificate acquisition
   process described adopts the trust model of the DHCP-PD process.  If
   the information used to build an IA_PD binding is sufficient for the
   server to delegate a prefix to a CPE, it is considered sufficient to
   have the server facilitate the process of acquiring a certificate.
   When the server provides a certificate to the client, it acts similar
   to a Registration Authority [8] and contacts the certificate
   authority for the certificate.  In that process, the server might
   need to provide, along with the other relevant information (ID,
   public key, prefix) a client's proof-of-possession.  This scenario is
   not addressed in this document.


11.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not define any new namespaces or other constants
   for which IANA must maintain a registry..
