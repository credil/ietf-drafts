Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title             September 2008


1.  Introduction

   Spam has grown from being:

   o  An interesting side-effect of new technology.

   o  A sometimes useful marketing tool.

   o  An overload of inbox-time.

   o  An overload of disk space.

   o  An overload of bandwidth.

   o  A dangerous affliction to useful technology.

   This document suggests a technique for reducing spam dispersion.
   Some estimates put spam traffic at astonishing levels.  Reports are
   available which speak in terms of 50% of email traffic.  Clearly
   there is much to be saved with reducing this traffic.


2.  A basic Did You Send protocol description.

   A fundamental question in confirming the origins of an object is to
   ask if it was sent by the sender.  Current smtp sessions are in the
   main, send and move on the next task.  There are of course, many
   tests made by the receiving agent as to the validity of the email.
   Though in search of a basic confirmation exchange, it could be found
   that a mechanism is already half in place.  In the form of the
   MessageID header of every email.  If the sending agent stores the
   MessageID data for a length of time, then the receiving agent was to
   query the originating agent on this field, confirmation of the send
   could be confirmed or denied.


3.  Processing requirements.

   It may have been impossible for earlier agent implementations to do
   this due to the storage and processing requirements percieved.  The
   cost of these is now greatly reduced.  Calculations would show it to
   be cheaper than the cost of current spam volumes.  Additionally,
   product such as SQLite have not been available until recently.


4.  Message ID header.

   The MessageID is a header field generated by a sending smtp[RFC2821]

   server.  Although Message-ID generation does need to be globally
   unique, there is an Internet Draft which suggests this possibility:
   draft-ietf-usefor-message-id-01.txt It is generally generated to be
   locally unique.  It usually uses the FQDN as a suffix, though as
   there has been no reason to use the uniqueness across domains, non-
   FQDN use has not been questioned.


5.  Uptake scenario.

   To ensure a reasonable path to implementation, conforming agents
   could be given a bypass filter.  This would reduce load on filters,
   reducing load on servers.


6.  Major advantages.

   o  Of significant annoyance to emailer.1 occurs when bounces are
      received from emailer.2 who have spam which appears to originate
      from emailer.1's domain, when in fact they are from a spamming
      bot-net or similar.

   o  Reduction in spam, registered addresses.

   o  Reduction of virus payloaded spam.


7.  Techniques for avoidance.

   Spammers will require a registered domain with a DYS enabled server.
   Reverse tracking is therefore possible.  Confirmation the spam was
   sent is implied.  In countries where spam is illegal, this may be
   useful as evidence.  In other countries, the sending smtp server is
   visible and block able.


8.  Denial of service risk.

   o  Scenario 1: Spammer creates botnet which targets a number of
      domains.  The domain's issue DYS's towards (unconfirmed)
      originating server/s (DYS.UOS).  The UOS's reply with many DYS
      'UNKNOWN'.  UOS's are inundated with DYS requests with possible
      adverse effects.  This requires a map of domains to smtp
      servers.This can be gained from MX records.  Response to this
      attack could be a focussed blacklist.

   o  Scenario 2: Spammer creates botnet which directly issues bogus DYS
      requests.  Mitigation: Check of reverse IP MX record would

      indicate a firewall rule is required

   o  Scenario 3: Spammer uses registered MX server to send spam.  A
      firewall trigger could block traffic after a number of requests.


9.  Potential reduction of spam.

   This is a function of co-operating smtp agents.  If all agents used
   this protocol, then 'spam' as we know it would be greatly reduced.


10.  Configure options.

   The sending agent has options on storage period of sent ID's.
   Subsequent handling of receipts could flag or delete the sent.ID.
   The sending agent could flag the sent.ID with the time of receipt.


11.  Security Considerations

   See section entitled: Denial of service risk.


12.  IANA considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.


13.  Normative References
