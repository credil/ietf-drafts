		<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
			<t>
			Simply put, communications protocols are standardized ways for computing entities to convey information.  
			Within each communications protocol, there must be standardized pieces of information that will be 
			communicated, and there may be non-standardized information that can be communicated.
			</t><t>
			<xref target="RFC0868">Time Protocol</xref> is an example of a protocol that only conveys standardized 
			information.  There is no way to add anything other than what is specified in the document.  On the other hand,
			<xref target="RFC0761">DoD standard Transmission Control Protocol</xref> does have "options" but they
			must be registered through the IANA <xref target="IANAtcp" />, which does not leave any room for 
			optional information supplied by equipment vendors, network operators, or experimenters.  Finally, 
			<xref target="RFC3925">Vendor-Identifying Vendor Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 4 (DHCPv4)</xref>
			does allow for vendor specific options.
			</t><t>
			If a network operator wanted to add specific information to the <xref target="RFC0868">Time Protocol</xref>,
			they could modify the code of the senders and receivers and run this within their own domain without any 
			problems.  However, if an equipment vendor wanted to include information specific to their equipment,
			they would have to ensure that all senders and receivers within all network domains would either accept the 
			change in the protocol, or would not have problems with it.  As a final case, if several equipment vendors
			desired to add equipment-specific information to this protocol, they would have to take great care that 
			only their own receivers would accept information from their own transmitters.  An extension to that would
			be that if one equipment vendor would like to transmit or receive the same information that another vendor
			is using.  
			</t><t>
			For the case of TCP <xref target="RFC0761" />, standard options are expected; senders may use them and 
			receivers may be configured
			to act upon that information, or to ignore it.  If an experimenter wants to add an option, they will have
			to create a new IETF RFC with the details, or obtain approval from the IESG to have the IANA add to
			the registry <xref target="IANAtcp" />.  Similarly, if equipment vendors Foo and Bar were to have a need
			for a similar option within TCP, they would each have to go through the process to add to the registry. 
			On the other hand, if a properly crafted multipurpose, private use option were to be registered, such as 
			in the case of multiple vendor instances within
			<xref target="RFC3925">Vendor-Identifying Vendor Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 4 (DHCPv4)</xref>
			then vendors and
			experimenters would each be able to use it for their own purposes as long as all network participants
			can easily differentiate between the entities using the option.
			</t><t>
			This document explores the various ways that protocols may allow optional information using fields
			designated as "private use" to be included in protocols, without disrupting the desired harmony of the network.

		<section anchor="history" title="Origins of the Private Use Name Space">
			<t>
			<xref target="RFC2432">Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs</xref>
			describes that values of specific name spaces may either be registered with the IANA, or not.
			In most cases, there are well defined values for name spaces.  However, as the document
			explains, not all name spaces require centralized administration.
			</t><t>
			In that document, it seems to be assumed that private use name spaces will be domain specific and 
			it will be up to the administrators of any domain to avoid conflicts.  The first example given about
			private use name spaces refers to <xref target="RFC2131">Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</xref> and
			presumably <xref target="RFC2132">DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions</xref>.  In this the example states
			that "site-specific options in DHCP have significance only within a single site".  As noted below this became a
			problem that was rectified in a later revision of DHCP.
			</t><t>
			Later works identified a need to place a scope on private use name spaces.  The second example of private use
			name spaces in <xref target="RFC2432" /> is from 
			<xref target="RFC0822">STANDARD FOR THE FORMAT OF ARPA INTERNET TEXT MESSAGES</xref>
			which describes X- headers.  Again, there is no effort made to control the name space.  It appears however that
			the users of X- headers have self-organized; most consistently use features that are universally useful and 
			many have incorporated identifiers for useful features that may overlap.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section anchor="words" title="Nomenclature">
			<t>
			In this document, the following words are defined to prevent ambiguity.  Some of these words have not been used in the 
			referenced works but their meanings can be ascertained.
			<list style="symbols"><t>
			communications protocol - a formal description of digital message formats and the rules for exchanging those messages 
			in or between computing systems and in telecommunications <xref target="wpProt" />
			</t><t>
			protocol frame - a defined container of fields used to convey information in a communications protocol
			</t><t>
			field - any defined container within a communications protocol frame
			</t><t>
			standard option - a field in a protocol frame that may only use values that are strictly defined within a specification
			</t><t>
			private use option - a field in a protocol frame that is reserved for private or local use only name spaces
			</t><t>
			name space - the set of possible values a field may contain; its actual content may be a name, a number or another kind of value
			</t></list></t>
			<t>
			Examples
			<list style="symbols"><t>
			communications protocol - <xref target="RFC0959">The File Transfer Protocol</xref> is an example of a communications protocol.
			It has well defined fields and standard options.  <xref target="RFC5424">The Syslog Protocol</xref> is another example of a
			communications protocol.  It has well defined fields, standard options, and it also has private use options.
			</t><t>
			protocol frame - An Internet Protocol packet <xref target="RFC0791" /> is considered to be a protocol frame.  
			In the case of <xref target="RFC0959">The File Transfer Protocol</xref>, an FTP message from the client to the server within the 
			<xref target="RFC0791">Internet Protocol</xref> containing an FTP command is a protocol frame.  In the case of 
			<xref target="RFC5424">The Syslog Protocol</xref>, a message from the client to the server within the 
			<xref target="RFC0791">Internet Protocol</xref> containing a syslog message is also a protocol frame.
			</t><t>
			field - In the case of <xref target="RFC0959">The File Transfer Protocol</xref>, a command will be contained within a field.  
			In the case of <xref target="RFC5424">The Syslog Protocol</xref>, the HOSTNAME is a field.
			</t><t>
			standard option - In the case of <xref target="RFC0959">The File Transfer Protocol</xref>, 
			an FTP command, such as CDUP and QUIT, is a standard option.  The reason that a command is
			a standard option is that only the values listed by the IANA in the registry <xref target="IANAftp" /> may be used.  The 
			standard options are not limited to the values defined in the original RFC, but also include any additions to the
			registry.
			In the case of <xref target="RFC5424">The Syslog Protocol</xref>, an SD-ID may be a standard option.  
			The example given in Section 7.1.4
			of <xref target="RFC5424" /> of 
				<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
     [timeQuality tzKnown="0" isSynced="0"]
				]]></artwork></figure> 
			is a standard option because all of the 
			fields are listed in the document and in the IANA registry <xref target="IANAslg" />.
			</t><t>
			private use option - In the case of The Syslog Protocol, an SD-ID may be a private use option.  Example 3 given in Section 6.5
			contains a private use option.
				<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      <165>1 2003-10-11T22:14:15.003Z mymachine.example.com
      evntslog - ID47 [exampleSDID@32473 iut="3" eventSource=
      "Application" eventID="1011"] BOMAn application
      event log entry...
				]]></artwork></figure> 
			Specifically, the SD-ID starting with "[exampleSDID@32473 ..." is not a specifically defined option in the RFC, nor
			is it registered in the IANA registry <xref target="IANAslg" />.  It is a way for an equipment vendor to insert their specific information
			without having to register anything.  In this case if the receiver knows the format of that SD-ID then it can
			immediately interpret its meaning.  However, if it does not know how to interpret that SD-ID, it can still log
			the message and an Operator or Administrator can look up its meaning at a later time.
			</t><t>
			name space - In the same Example 3 from Section 6.5 of <xref target="RFC5424">The Syslog Protocol</xref>, 
			"exampleSDID@32473" provides the name space
			so the context of the rest of the SD-ID may be interpreted.  Specifically the Private Enterprise Number 
			<xref target="IANApen" /> (PEN) is used to associate the option with a private enterprise, and the text before
			the "@" identifies the option defined within that private enterprise.
			</t>
			</list></t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="ways" title="Examples of Successful Private Use Options">
			<t>
			This section contains a review of RFCs that allow the use of private use options.  There seem to be three ways
			to address the name space: via a global origin, via a truncated numerical origin, and via a namespace based upon
			the domain name.
			</t>
			<section anchor="smi" title="SNMP">
				<t>
				Likely, the first private use option was defined in the 
				<xref target="RFC1155">Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based Internets</xref>
				which was first used in 
				<xref target="RFC1067">A Simple Network Management Protocol</xref> (SNMP).
				The structure of management information (SMI) has been updated and
				is currently defined as the
				<xref target="RFC2578">Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)</xref>.
				</t><t>
				SMI is a well described tree of OBJECT IDENTIFIERs.  It has an origin and a path for defined object identifiers
				which this document describes as standard options.  It also allows for experimental and vendor 
				specific object identifiers, which are described as private use options in this document.  The IANA maintains a
				registry of these Network Management Parameters <xref target="IANAsmi" />.
				</t><t>
				The Internet subtree of experimental OBJECT IDENTIFIERs starts with the prefix:
				1.3.6.1.3., and 
				the Internet subtree of private enterprise OBJECT IDENTIFIERs starts with the prefix:
				1.3.6.1.4.1.
				This is followed by a <xref target="IANApen">Private Enterprise Number</xref> (PEN) and then the OBJECT IDENTIFIERs
				defined by that enterprise.
				</t><t>
				While this is very practical and practicable for SNMP, fully qualified SMIs do not lend themselves well for other uses as
				a generic private use option.
				</t>
			</section>
			<section anchor="pen" title="Private Enterprise Number">
				<t>
				Rather than using the entire SMI, protocol engineers started using just the Private Enterprise Number 
				<xref target="IANApen" />.  This reduces the length of the identifier but continues to provide an 
				identifier through a globally unique name space.  This subsection provides examples of how the PEN has
				been used to provide private use options.
				</t>
				<section anchor="radius" title="RADIUS">
                        		<t>
					<xref target="RFC2058">The Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)</xref> specification
					documented how to use just the PEN (without the rest of the SMI path to the root) to allow
					"vendors" to articulate their own options.  In this document, these are called Vendor-Specific Attributes (VSA).
					</t><t>
					The updated RADIUS document, <xref target="RFC2865" />, gives guidance for using the VSA.
						<list style="symbols">
						<t>
						Servers not equipped to interpret the vendor-specific information
						sent by a client MUST ignore it (although it may be reported).
						</t><t>
						Clients which do not receive desired vendor-specific information
						SHOULD make an attempt to operate without it, although they may do
						so (and report they are doing so) in a degraded mode.
						</t><t>
						The Attribute-Specific field is dependent on the vendor's definition of that attribute.
						</t><t>
						It SHOULD be encoded as a sequence of vendor type / vendor length / value fields.
						</t><t>
						Multiple subattributes MAY be encoded within a single Vendor-Specific Attribute, although they do not have to be.
						</t>
						</list>
					</t><t>
					There are many attributes defined in RADIUS <xref target="RFC2058" /> which may be considered to be standard variables.
					Each of these attributes are specified within a "type length value" (tlv) container.
					For this protocol, the VSA "type" is a specific numerical value which separates it from other attributes.
					Type 26 (decimal) denotes a VSA, and the PEN starts the "value" which should then include a subsequent nested
					tlv so the vendor may enumerate their own options within the field.
					</t>
				</section>
				<section anchor="mobile" title="Mobile IP">
                        		<t>
					<xref target="RFC3115">Mobile IP Vendor Specific Extensions</xref>
					defines two extensions that can be used for making organization
					specific extensions by vendors/organizations for their own specific
					purposes for Mobile IP <xref target="RFC2002" />.  Mobile IP has been revised several times and is currently
					specified in <xref target="RFC5944">IP Mobility Support for IPv4, Revised</xref>.
					</t><t>
					In this specification, two tlv's have been defined to contain private use options.  These are called 
					Vendor/Organization Specific Extensions (VSE).
						<list style="symbols">
						<t>
						When the Critical Vendor/Organization Specific Extension (CVSE) is encountered but not recognized,
						the message containing the extension MUST be silently discarded.
						</t><t>
						When a Normal Vendor/Organization Specific Extension (NVSE) is
						encountered but not recognized, the extension SHOULD be ignored, but
						the rest of the Extensions and message data MUST still be processed.
						</t>
						</list>
					Having two VSEs of this nature for private use options is consistent with the original Mobile IP specification
					<xref target="RFC2002" /> which states:
						<list><t>
						When an Extension numbered in either of these sets within the range 0
						through 127 is encountered but not recognized, the message containing
						that Extension MUST be silently discarded.  When an Extension
						numbered in the range 128 through 255 is encountered which is not
						recognized, that particular Extension is ignored, but the rest of the
						Extensions and message data MUST still be processed.

				<section anchor="dhcp" title="DHCP">
                        		<t>
					The introduction to <xref target="RFC3925">
					Vendor-Identifying Vendor Options for
					Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 4 (DHCPv4)</xref> states:<list><t>
   The DHCP protocol for IPv4, <xref target="RFC2131" />, defines options that allow
   a client to indicate its vendor type (option 60), and the DHCP client
   and server to exchange vendor-specific information (option 43) <xref target="RFC2132" />.
   Although there is no prohibition against passing multiple copies of
   these options in a single packet, doing so would introduce ambiguity
   of interpretation, particularly if conveying vendor-specific
   information for multiple vendors.
					</t></list></t><t>
					This meant that <xref target="RFC2131">Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</xref>
					specified that there was one instance of the vendor type, and the receiver used that name space
					to set the scope for the fields in the vendor-specific information option.
					</t><t>
					This situation was resolved with the publication of <xref target="RFC3925">
					Vendor-Identifying Vendor Options for
					Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 4 (DHCPv4)</xref> which states:<list><t>
   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) options for Vendor
   Class and Vendor-Specific Information can be limiting or ambiguous
   when a DHCP client represents multiple vendors.</t></list></t><t>
					That specification (<xref target="RFC3925" />) then used the PEN <xref target="IANApen" /> 
					to defined a unique name space for private use options in
					this protocol.  Similar to other protocols of this era, tlv containers were used.
					</t>
				</section>
				<section anchor="ipfix" title="IPFIX">
                        		<t>
					Recording IP flow information is the subject of the <xref target="RFC5101">
					Specification of the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Protocol
					for the Exchange of IP Traffic Flow Information</xref>.  
					Since flows may be created and concluded very quickly, processing speed is essential
					to this protocol.  As such, it is a protocol based upon binary fields that can be
					interpreted quickly.
					</t><t>
					Even though the protocol is binary oriented rather than character oriented, it still uses
					the PEN to identify the origin of the private use option.  All options are identified as
					Information Elements in this specification.  The first field of each Information Element
					is a single bit identified as the Enterprise bit, which is defined as follows:
					<list><t>
      Enterprise bit.  This is the first bit of the Field Specifier.  If
      this bit is zero, the Information Element Identifier identifies an
      IETF-specified Information Element, and the four-octet Enterprise
      Number field MUST NOT be present.  If this bit is one, the
      Information Element identifier identifies an enterprise-specific
      Information Element, and the Enterprise Number filed MUST be
      present.
					</t></list>
					</t><t>
					The specification goes on to say:
					<list><t>
   The Collecting Process MUST note the Information Element identifier
   of any Information Element that it does not understand and MAY
   discard that Information Element from the Flow Record.
					</t></list>
					</t>
				</section>
				<section anchor="syslog" title="Syslog">
					<t>
					<xref target="RFC5424">The Syslog Protocol</xref> also uses the PEN to
					uniquely qualify the name space for a private use option.  Standard options do not contain the "@"
					character.  Private use options must have the PEN following the "@" character.  This allows a
					vendor or experimenter to have overlapping name spaces which the PEN will then uniquely identify.
					For example a standard option is tzKnown which may only have associated values of "0" and "1".  However
					tzKnown@32473 may have any value assigned to it by the owner of enterprise number 32473.
					</t><t>
					Syslog transport receivers are supposed to accept all correctly formatted Syslog messages.
					Unlike RADIUS, the receiving Syslog application does not have to have immediate knowledge of all variable
					options to continue operations.  If a private use option is not immediately known to the receiving 
					application, it may still store the message and an Operator or Administrator may look it up at a 
					later time if they are really interested.

			<section anchor="ssh" title="Character strings">
				<t>
                        	<xref target="RFC4251">The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture</xref> uses character strings rather
				than PENs.  Similar to Syslog, but actually predating it, standard options must not have the "@" character
				in them.  Private use options will have an origin identifier preceding an "@" character followed by a name space
				field.  For example, in <xref target="RFC4254">The Secure Shell (SSH) Connection Protocol</xref> SSH
				channels may be opened by specifying a channel type when sending the SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN message.  Standard
				options for the channel type include "session" and "x11".  A private use option for a channel type could be
				"example_session@example.com".  
                        	</t><t>
				Obviously, these character strings are domain names <xref target="RFC1034" /> <xref target="RFC1035" />.
				This is specified in <xref target="RFC4251">The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture</xref>.  
				Generally, the guidance given is that if a private use option of this nature is not understood it is to
				convey to its peer an error code.

		<section anchor="means" title="Characteristics of Useful Private Use Options">
			<t>
			This section summarizes the observed characteristics
			of private use options that are successful and deployed.
			</t><t>
			There seem to be three characteristics of successful private use options.
			</t>
			<section anchor="source" title="Source of Authority">
				<t>
				A private use option requires a path to an origin that has the authority to
				create and maintain the option.  As shown above, this referent should be unique, and not dependent
				upon local interpretation.
				</t><t>
				In the case of <xref target="smi">SNMP</xref>, the globally unique origin is the 
				<xref target="ISO">International Standards Organization</xref>
				which is accredited by the United Nations to maintain this structure.  However, the 
				namespace resolves to the <xref target="pen">PEN</xref> which does not seem to be globally unique.
				</t><t>
				The <xref target="pen">PEN</xref> is sourced by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
				While there seems to be no reports of problems using PENs, PENs do not seem to be unique.  
				It appears that some private enterprises have registered multiple PENs, and that there are some private
				enterprises whose PENs are no longer serviceable, mostly because they have been acquired by other
				companies, or they have gone out of business.  
				</t><t>
				Domain names have similar problems as they can be more ephemeral than eternal.  The top level domains
				are maintained by the <xref target="ICANN">Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</xref>
				however the specific names are assigned much more locally.  Unlike PENs that become unserviceable
				when their owning organization goes out of business, domain names that fall into disuse may be
				acquired and used by entirely different organizations.  Again however, like the use of PENs there
				have not been any problems reported from this.
				</t>
			</section>
			<section anchor="focus" title="Focus of the Name Space">
				<t>
				Once the source of authority is established, an actual option, or options, must be specified.
				</t><t>
				In the case of <xref target="smi">SNMP</xref>, after the vendor identifier (the PEN) in the management information
				base (MIB) a vendor can create many different trees to identify objects.  This may result in a very large number
				of object identifiers which are called private use options in this document.
				</t><t>
				The <xref target="pen">PEN</xref> can used in myriad ways.
				<list><t>
				For <xref target="radius">RADIUS</xref>, the PEN is used as the first field in the resolution of an option.  
				The recommendation is that the vendor then create a tlv, or multiple tlv's, within the option field.
				That would allow a vendor to specify multiple values, each with a different focus,
				within the same option field by concatenating tlv's.
				</t><t>
				<xref target="mobile">Mobile IP</xref> allows that a vendor may have multiple private use options within
				a protocol frame.  Each will start as any other option, will include the PEN as the source of authority
				to specify the option, and will then have a "type" field to denote the focus of the option.  The "type"
				will either be the Vendor-NVSE-Type or the Vendor-CVSE-Type.  Regardless, there is only one "value" allowed
				in each option field.  A vendor wishing to include multiple private use options would then have to 
				create multiple options, each with a different focus, within a protocol frame.
				</t><t>
				As it is used today, <xref target="dhcp">DHCP</xref> only allows a single instance of the PEN as
				a vendor option identifier in a protocol frame.  Within the option, sub-option codes are to be used as the start of one or more tlv's
				which will allow a vendor to specify as many private use options as they need.  This is similar to 
				RADIUS.
				</t><t>
				In the <xref target="ipfix">IPFIX</xref> template, private use options are described within Information
				Elements.  These may have multiple values described through Information Element Identifiers, which makes
				this quite extensible.
				</t><t>
				The <xref target="syslog">Syslog protocol</xref> allows for the focus of the private use option to be
				fully defined by the vendor within the structured data.  Specifically, a vendor may define a "type" of
				private use option by concatenating it with the PEN by using the @ character.  Within the bounds of
				the structured data, multiple elements may be used that have identifiers and values.
				</t></list></t>
				<t>
				Finally, in the <xref target="ssh">SSH protocol</xref>, the focus of the option is dependent upon context.
				For example, ourcipher-cbcexample.com can only be used when negotiating ciphers, while example_sessionexample.com
				can only be used when negotiating channel types per the examples in <xref target="RFC4250" />.
				</t>
			</section>
			<section anchor="value" title="Value of the Option">
				<t>
				The value of each private use option must be extensible but bounded.  (I'd write more but see <xref target="notes" />.)
				</t>
			</section>
		</section>
		
		<section anchor="thinkaboutit" title="Issues to Consider">
			<t>
			Private use options are useful to the community and are gaining popularity.  This is a way to allow
			vendors, network operators, and experimenters to convey dynamic information without going
			through a rigorous process to register each variable.  
			</t><t>
			There is no "one size fits all" mechanism.  The use of a very specific and fixed format works very well
			for IPFIX which requires speed in processing.  On the other hand, the open nature of the private use 
			options in Syslog is appropriate for that protocol.
			</t><t>
			The structure of the SMI is uniform and globally unique, but the pen is not up to date.  It appears that
			the people listed as the contacts for some of the organizations have moved on, and that some of the 
			organizations have either been acquired by other organizations or have gone out of business.  It also 
			appears that some organizations have registered multiple PENs.  The author is really not sure why they
			would need to do that so any clue here would be appreciated.
			</t><t>
			Using the PEN with an extension or even with an entire SMI may be constrained to fit nicely into a 
			binary oriented protocol that has strict field lengths.  Using domain names, as SSH does, may also be fit within binary protocols
			but since domain name lengths vary, tlv's or some other mechanism may need to be used to establish the boundaries 
			of fields.
			</t><t>
			RADIUS dictates what to do if a private use option is not understood by a receiver.  
			<xref target="RFC3115">Mobile IP Vendor Specific Extensions</xref> builds on that by letting a receiver know
			if it must process the entire packet containing a private use option, or if it may ignore a private use option
			that it doesn't understand but yet continue processing the rest of the packet.  On the other hand, Syslog
			does not require a receiver to understand anything about any private use options.  It is expected that
			receivers that do understand the private use options will be able to take actions more appropriately based
			on the information they receiver.
			</t><t>
			From that, it is important to define in protocol specifications what actions to take when a receiver receives
			a frame with a private use options.

			This section will be removed prior to publication.
			</t><t>
			Now that I've written it, I'm thinking that I should pivot the "characteristics" section.  I think it would be 
			easier to explain source/focus/value on a per protocol basis rather than each with examples within each
			protocol.  That will be done in -01.  :-)
			</t><t>
			I need to revise the Issues section.  I'd like to write a lot more description there but I want this
			version out the door first.

		<section anchor="sec" title="Security Considerations">
			<t>
			This document reviews ways that options are being used in various protocols.
			As such, there are no security considerations inherent in this document.
			</t><t>
			Readers and implementers should be aware of the context of implementing options 
			in their own protocols.
