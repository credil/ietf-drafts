       P2P Streaming for Mobile Nodes: Scenarios and Related Issues
                        draft-lu-ppsp-mobile-03.txt


Abstract

   The scenarios where a Peer-to-Peer Streaming Protocol (PPSP) contains
   mobile nodes need special considerations.  An analysis of all the
   scenarios that involve mobile nodes is necessary to provide the
   guidelines to PPSP protocol design and applicability.  This document
   describes some key issues for a PPSP network with mobile nodes, and
   proposes some additional requirements for PPSP to handle these
   scenarios.

1. Introduction

   The PPSP Working Group is developing protocols for Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
   streaming systems [I-D.zong-ppsp-reqs]. In the past P2P solutions

   have mostly targeted wired or fixed connections. Mobile P2P
   communications are expected to grow rapidly and the nature of mobile
   nodes and mobile environments cause specific challenges to P2P
   communications, specifically for streaming scenarios. This draft
   discusses some key mobility specific issues.



2. Conventions and Terminology

   This document uses the same terminologies as [I-D.zong-ppsp-reqs].
   For simplicity, this document illustrates scenarios showing a
   centralized Tracker architecture.  However, it should be understood
   that all the scenarios also apply to the distributed architecture,
   e.g. using a Distributed Hash Table (DHT).



3. Mobile Node Issues

   Mobile nodes are constrained by nature due to their limited battery,
   screen size, computational capability, etc. Also mobile nodes operate
   in variable and unpredictable environments. These attributes bring
   about the following problems that may adversely affect the P2P
   Streaming sessions.



3.1. Uplink vs. Downlink Bandwidth

   Often mobile nodes have asymmetrical bandwidth capabilities. For
   instance, most mobile nodes are capable of handling higher bit rates
   in the downlink (to the mobile) than in the uplink (from the mobile).
   In addition, many mobile networks also have policies to assign
   bandwidth in this asymmetrical manner regardless of the capabilities
   of the mobile node. Since peer-to-peer streaming sessions can be
   either generated or terminated on a mobile node, this bandwidth
   asymmetry should be considered for the Tracker-Peer protocol (e.g. as
   part of Peer status parameters reported to the Tracker), and may also
   affect Peer-Peer protocol in the peer information negotiation.



3.2. Battery Power

   By definition, a mobile node is often disconnected from the
   electrical grid and runs on its own battery power.   In this


Lu, et al.             Expires January 9, 2011                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft      P2P Streaming for Mobile Nodes       September 2010


   scenario, the user of the mobile node may want to restrict the types
   of P2P sessions that the mobile node should participate in because of
   battery drain issues.  For example, the user may be willing to
   participate in a P2P session if the user herself is watching the
   content.  However, the user may not want to participate in uploading
   large amounts of content to other peers.

   Therefore, battery power (or battery status) of a mobile node should
   be considered in both the Peer-Peer and the Tracker-Peer protocols
   (e.g. as part of Peer status parameters reported to the Tracker and
   other peers).



3.3. Multiple Interfaces

   Simple IP refers to the scenario where there is no IP layer mobility
   protocol such as Mobile IP or Proxy Mobile IP, and a peer needs to
   obtain a new IP address through a standard method like DHCP after
   losing the previous IP address.

   As illustrated in Figure 1, when Peer 1 moves from AN1 to AN2, its IP
   address changes from IP1 to IP2. This will impact both the Peer-Peer
   connection and the Tracker-Peer connection. For example, Peer-Peer
   communication maybe lost (e.g. Peer 2 incorrectly sends chunks to IP1
   even though Peer 1 has now changed address to IP2).  Also the
   Tracker-Peer communication may be compromised (e.g. Tracker has
   corrupted Peer lists containing incorrect IP Address for Peer 1).

   These effects may be somewhat mitigated by having the mobile node
   update the tracker and corresponding peers with its new IP address.
   The key question then is the trade-off between signaling required to
   provide notification of the IP address change and the load this
   causes on the system.  Also race conditions must be carefully
   considered.

   Therefore, reporting of change of the IP address of a mobile node
   should be considered in both the Peer-Peer and the Tracker-Peer
   protocols.

3.4. Geo-Targeting

   Geo-targeting is a technique used to determine the physical location
   (i.e. geo-location) of a user. The geo-location is based on
   geographical and other personal information provided by the requester
   peer or a third party. Techniques to determine geo-location of a user
   can rely on civic location, GPS geographical coordinates, cellular
   base station ID, or most commonly IP address. The primary source for
   IP address geographical data is the regional Internet registries.

   Depending on the location, different regulations and rules may apply.
   For instance, some content may not be distributed on certain
   locations or can only be distributed on some other locations.



Lu, et al.             Expires January 9, 2011                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      P2P Streaming for Mobile Nodes       September 2010


   Current content distribution policies can apply certain rules to
   fixed P2P Streaming clients. However, device mobility may hide the
   peer movement from one region to another where possibly different
   content distribution rules may apply hence rendering the set forth
   policies un-enforceable.  This may also be the case where the peer is
   connecting through a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

   Therefore, geo-location reporting of a mobile node should be
   considered in both the Peer-Peer and the Tracker-Peer protocols.



4. Conclusion and Recommendations

   The PPSP Working Group should consider the impacts of various aspects
   of mobility discussed in this draft.  In particular, PPSP should
   consider how these issues can be mitigated in a mobile P2P streaming
   environment when designing both the PPSP Peer-Peer and the Tracker-
   Peer protocols.  Therefore, it is recommended that the following
   requirements be added to the "Basic Requirements to PPSP Node"
   section of [I-D.zong-ppsp-reqs]:

   PPSP.REQ-1: Change in IP address of a Peer device MUST immediately be
   reported via the Tracker Protocol and Peer Protocol

   PPSP.REQ-2: Available uplink and downlink bandwidth of a Peer device
   SHOULD be reported via the Tracker Protocol and Peer Protocol

   PPSP.REQ-3: Battery status of a Peer device SHOULD be reported via
   the Tracker Protocol and Peer Protocol

   PPSP.REQ-4: Location of a Peer device SHOULD be reported via the
   Tracker Protocol and Peer Protocol

9.1. Processing Power

   Some devices are more capable than others in terms of computational
   performance or processing power. Similarly, devices can have
   different performance for generating a session (e.g. video recording)
   or terminating it (e.g. video display). Taking these differences into
   account is important for maintaining a good quality of the P2P
   streaming session.





9.2. Link Layer Mobility

   PPSP uses a P2P based overlay network on top of the transport
   network. Mobility or link quality at link layers is not visible to
   the peers.

   As illustrated in Figure 1, if Peer 1 is connected to a poor quality
   link via mobile Access Network 1 (AN1), then the overall P2P
   streaming session quality can suffer from high error rate and low
   throughput due to poor link layer conditions. This will impact both
   the Peer-Peer connection and the Tracker-Peer connection.  For
   example, on the Peer-Peer connection frame loss, audio/video synch
   loss, or streaming stalls are likely to be seen on the media transfer
   protocols.

9.3. Mobile IP

   Mobile IP (MIP) provides IP mobility and hides the mobile's movement
   from the Correspondent Node (CN) [RFC3775].

   Figure 3 illustrates the case when Peer 1 moves from AN1 to AN1'.
   Because of Mobile IP, neither the Tracker nor Peer 2 are aware of the
   change of network for peer 1. However, due to the inherent tunneling
   and triangular routing of the Mobile IP protocol (through the Home
   Agent) the P2P session may in some scenarios experience extra
   latency. This may adversely affect the user experience of the P2P

   streaming session. As seen above, Mobile IP will impact primarily the
   Peer-Peer connection (and the Tracker-Peer connection is not
   significantly affected).

Internet-Draft      P2P Streaming for Mobile Nodes       September 2010


9.4. Proxy Mobile IP

   The use of Proxy Mobile IP [RFC5213] causes similar issues as the
   ones mentioned for Mobile IP in the above section. On top of these,
   Proxy Mobile IP also introduces a new issue for P2P streaming
   sessions. Since Proxy Mobile IP is a network based solution, the
   mobile node (peer) is not aware of its IP mobility so it cannot
   inform the Tracker, P2P Cache, CDNs or other peers of the IP level
   mobility. Therefore IP mobility is totally invisible to the P2P
   Streaming session entities and harder to detect and respond
   accordingly. Thus Proxy Mobile IP will impact both the Peer-Peer
   connection and the Tracker-Peer connection.



9.5. Mobility support with RELOAD

   It has already been identified in the proposed WG charter that any
   PPSP developed protocol should be analyzed for interactions with the
   RELOAD protocol. The RELOAD protocol provides a signaling and routing
   mechanism for P2P overlay networks over the general Internet.  The
   latest RELOAD draft [I-D.ietf-p2psip-base] also has a future
   consideration section for support of HIP (section 5.6.1.1).  HIP is
   an experimental mobility protocol with good security properties.

   In addition to HIP, the following mobility protocols should also be
   considered for PPSP-RELOAD interactions:

     .  Mobile IP

     .  Proxy Mobile IP



9.6. Tracker Mobility

   Normally Trackers are assumed to be fixed nodes. However, in a mobile
   environment mobile nodes can also become Trackers. In this sense,
   similar considerations to the ones described above for mobile peers
   should be applied to mobile Trackers.
