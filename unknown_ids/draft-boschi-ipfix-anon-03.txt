   This document describes anonymisation techniques for IP flow data and
   the export of anonymised data using the IPFIX protocol.  It provides
   a categorization of common anonymisation schemes and defines the

   parameters needed to describe them.  It provides guidelines for the
   implementation of anonymised data export and storage over IPFIX, and
   describes an Options-based method for anonymization metadata export
   within the IPFIX protocol, providing the basis for the definition of
   information models for configuring anonymisation techniques within an
   IPFIX Metering or Exporting Process, and for reporting the technique
   in use to an IPFIX Collecting Process.

1.  Open Issues

   There is not yet a mechanism for exporting information about defined-
   time anonymisation stability.

   The terminology section is incomplete; we should decide which of the
   terms introduced in this document are to be treated as terminology.

   Between "classes" of techniques and "parameters", there may be
   "properties" as well; for example, binning and timestamp
   anonymisation may be "ordered" or not (x>y in real --> x>y in
   anonymized).  We should verify that we're splitting these up
   correctly.

   In parallel with this, the anonymisationTechnique values might be
   useful as a bitfield, with properties and classes being represented
   by some set of the bits in the field.  We'll have to make sure that
   the properties and classes are exhaustive, if we do this.

   Both anonymisationStability and anonymisationTechnique might benefit
   from the creation of IANA registries; HOWEVER, in this case, it would
   be very important to ensure that such a registry contains only
   classes and properties of anonymised data, not information about
   specific algorithms.

   Certain technique/IE combinaitons (e.g. structure-preserving
   counters) don't make any sense; these should be noted in "IPFIX-
   Specific Anonymisation Guidelines".

   Guidelines should be provided for the evaluation of _new_ IEs added
   to the IANA registry after the publication of this draft for their
   anonymisation potential.

   This document does not cover the anonymisation of sub-IP level
   information, specifically MAC addresses.  It should.


2.  Introduction

   The standardisation of an IP flow information export protocol
   [RFC5101] and associated representations removes a technical barrier
   to the sharing of IP flow data across organizational boundaries and
   with network operations, security, and research communities for a
   wide variety of purposes.  However, with wider dissemination comes
   greater risks to the privacy of the users of networks under
   measurement, and to the security of those networks.  While it is not
   a complete solution to the issues posed by distribution of IP flow
   information, anonymisation is an important tool for the protection of

Internet-Draft        IP Flow Anonymisation Support           March 2009


   privacy within network measurement infrastructures.

   This document presents a mechanism for representing anonymised data
   within IPFIX and guidelines for using it.  It begins with a
   categorization of anonymisation techniques.  It then describes
   applicability of each technique to commonly anonymisable fields of IP
   flow data, organized by information element data type and semantics
   as in [RFC5102]; enumerates the parameters required by each of the
   applicable anonymisation techniques; and provides guidelines for the
   use of each of these techniques in accordance with best practices in
   data protection.  Finally, it specifies a mechanism for exporting
   anonymised data and binding anonymisation metadata to templates using
   IPFIX Options.

2.1.  IPFIX Protocol Overview

   In the IPFIX protocol, { type, length, value } tuples are expressed
   in templates containing { type, length } pairs, specifying which {
   value } fields are present in data records conforming to the
   Template, giving great flexibility as to what data is transmitted.
   Since Templates are sent very infrequently compared with Data
   Records, this results in significant bandwidth savings.  Various
   different data formats may be transmitted simply by sending new
   Templates specifying the { type, length } pairs for the new data
   format.  See [RFC5101] for more information.

   The IPFIX information model [RFC5102] defines a large number of
   standard Information Elements which provide the necessary { type }
   information for Templates.  The use of standard elements enables
   interoperability among different vendors' implementations.
   Additionally, non-standard enterprise-specific elements may be
   defined for private use.

2.2.  IPFIX Documents Overview

   "Specification of the IPFIX Protocol for the Exchange of IP Traffic
   Flow Information" [RFC5101] and its associated documents define the
   IPFIX Protocol, which provides network engineers and administrators
   with access to IP traffic flow information.

   "Architecture for IP Flow Information Export"
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-architecture] defines the architecture for the export
   of measured IP flow information out of an IPFIX Exporting Process to
   an IPFIX Collecting Process, and the basic terminology used to
   describe the elements of this architecture, per the requirements
   defined in "Requirements for IP Flow Information Export" [RFC3917].
   The IPFIX Protocol document [RFC5101] then covers the details of the
   method for transporting IPFIX Data Records and Templates via a



Boschi & Trammell        Expires October 1, 2009                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        IP Flow Anonymisation Support           March 2009


   congestion-aware transport protocol from an IPFIX Exporting Process
   to an IPFIX Collecting Process.

   "Information Model for IP Flow Information Export" [RFC5102]
   describes the Information Elements used by IPFIX, including details
   on Information Element naming, numbering, and data type encoding.
   Finally, "IPFIX Applicability" [I-D.ietf-ipfix-as] describes the
   various applications of the IPFIX protocol and their use of
   information exported via IPFIX, and relates the IPFIX architecture to
   other measurement architectures and frameworks.

   Additionally, the "Specification of the IPFIX File Format"
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-file] describes a file format based upon the IPFIX
   Protocol for the storage of flow data.

   This document references the Protocol and Architecture documents for
   terminology, and extends the IPFIX Information Model to provide new
   Information Elements for anonymisation metadata.  The anonymisation
   techniques described herein are equally applicable to the IPFIX
   Protocol and data stored in IPFIX Files.


3.  Terminology

   Terms used in this document that are defined in the Terminology
   section of the IPFIX Protocol [RFC5101] document are to be
   interpreted as defined there.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


4.  Categorisation of Anonymisation Techniques

   Anonymisation modifies a data set in order to protect the identity of
   the people or entities described by the data set from disclosure.
   With respect to network traffic data, anonymisation generally
   attempts to preserve some set of properties of the network traffic
   useful for a given application or applications, while ensuring the
   data cannot be traced back to the specific networks, hosts, or users
   generating the traffic.

   Anonymisation may be broadly classified according to two properties:
   recoverability and countability.  All anonymisation techniques map
   the real space of identifiers or values into a separate, anonymised
   space, according to some function.  A technique is said to be
   recoverable when the function used is invertible or can otherwise be



Boschi & Trammell        Expires October 1, 2009                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        IP Flow Anonymisation Support           March 2009


   reversed and a real identifier can be recovered from a given
   replacement identifier.

   Countability compares the dimension of the anonymised space (N) to
   the dimension of the real space (M), and denotes how the count of
   unique values is preserved by the anonymisation function.  If the
   anonymised space is smaller than the real space, then the function is
   said to generalise the input, mapping more than one input point to
   each anonymous value (e.g., as with aggregation).  By definition,
   generalisation is not recoverable.

   If the dimensions of the anonymised and real spaces are the same,
   such that the count of unique values is preserved, then the function
   is said to be a direct substitution function.  If the dimension of
   the anonymised space is larger, such that each real value maps to a
   set of anonymised values, then the function is said to be a set
   substitution function.  Note that with set substitution functions,
   the sets of anonymised values are not necessarily disjoint.  Either
   direct or set substitution functions are said to be one-way if there
   exists no method for recovering the real data point from an
   anonymised one.

   This classification is summarised in the table below.

   +------------------------+-----------------+------------------------+
   | Recoverability /       | Recoverable     | Non-recoverable        |
   | Countability           |                 |                        |
   +------------------------+-----------------+------------------------+
   | N < M                  | N.A.            | Generalisation         |
   | N = M                  | Direct          | One-way Direct         |
   |                        | Substitution    | Substitution           |
   | N > M                  | Set             | One-way Set            |
   |                        | Substitution    | Substitution           |
   +------------------------+-----------------+------------------------+


5.  Anonymisation of IP Flow Data

   Due to the restricted semantics of IP flow data, there are a
   relatively limited set of specific anonymisation techniques available
   on flow data, though each falls into the broad categories above.
   Each type of field that may commonly appear in a flow record may have
   its own applicable specific techniques.

   While anonymisation is generally applied at the resolution of single
   fields within a flow record, attacks against anonymisation use entire
   flows and relationships between hosts and flows within a given data
   set.  Therefore, fields which may not necessarily be identifying by



Boschi & Trammell        Expires October 1, 2009                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        IP Flow Anonymisation Support           March 2009


   themselves may be anonymised in order to increase the anonymity of
   the data set as a whole.

   Of all the fields in an IP flow record, only IP addresses directly
   identify entities in the real world.  Each IP address is associated
   with an interface on a network host, and can potentially be
   identified with a single user.  Additionally, IP addresses are
   structured identifiers; that is, partial IP address prefixes may be
   used to identify networks just as full IP addresses identify hosts.
   This makes anonymisation of IP addresses particularly important.

   Port numbers identify abstract entities (applications) as opposed to
   real-world entities, but they can be used to classify hosts and user
   behavior.  Passive port fingerprinting, both of well-known and
   ephemeral ports, can be used to determine the operating system
   running on a host.  Relative data volumes by port can also be used to
   determine the host's function (workstation, web server, etc.); this
   information can be used to identify hosts and users.

   While not identifiers in and of themselves, timestamps and counters
   can reveal the behavior of the hosts and users on a network.  Any
   given network activity is recognizable by a pattern of relative time
   differences and data volumes in the associated sequence of flows,
   even without host address information.  They can therefore be used to
   identify hosts and users.  Timestamps and counters are also
   vulnerable to traffic injection attacks, where traffic with a known
   pattern is injected into a network under measurement, and this
   pattern is later identified in the anonymised data set.

   The simplest and most extreme form of anonymisation, which can be
   applied to any field of a flow record, is black-marker anonymisation,
   or complete deletion of a given field.  Note that black-marker
   anonymisation is equivalent to simply not exporting the field(s) in
   question.

   While black-marker anonymisation completely protects the data in the
   deleted fields from the risk of disclosure, it also reduces the
   utility of the anonymised data set as a whole.  Techniques that
   retain some information while reducing (though not eliminating) the
   disclosure risk will be extensively discussed in the following
   sections; note that the techniques specifically applicable to IP
   addresses, timestamps, ports, and counters will be discussed in
   separate sections.

5.1.  IP Address Anonymisation

   Since IP addresses are the most common identifiers within flow data
   that can be used to directly identify a person, organization, or



Boschi & Trammell        Expires October 1, 2009                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        IP Flow Anonymisation Support           March 2009


   host, most of the work on flow and trace data anonymisation has gone
   into IP address anonymisation techniques.  Indeed, the aim of most
   attacks against anonymisation is to recover the map from anonymised
   IP addresses to original IP addresses thereby identifying the
   identified hosts.  There is therefore a wide range of IP address
   anonymisation schemes that fit into the following categories.

       +------------------------------------+---------------------+
       | Scheme                             | Action              |
       +------------------------------------+---------------------+
       | Truncation                         | Generalisation      |
       | Random Permutation                 | Direct Substitution |
       | Prefix-preserving Pseudonymisation | Direct Substitution |
       +------------------------------------+---------------------+

5.1.1.  Truncation

   Truncation removes "n" of the least significant bits from an IP
   address, replacing them with zeroes.  In effect, it replaces a host
   address with a network address for some fixed netblock; for IPv4
   addresses, 8-bit truncation corresponds to replacement with a /24
   network address.  Truncation is a non-reversible generalisation
   scheme.  Note that while truncation is effective for making hosts
   non-identifiable, it preserves information which can be used to
   identify an organization, a geographic region, a country, or a
   continent (or RIR region of responsibility).

   Truncation to an address length of 0 is equivalent to black-marker
   anonymisation.  Removal of IP address information is only recommended
   for analysis tasks which have no need to separate flow data by host
   or network; e.g. as a first stage to per-application (port) or time-
   series total volume analyses.

5.1.2.  Random Permutation

   Random permutation is a direct substitution technique, replacing each
   IP address with an address randomly selected from the set of possible
   IP addresses, guaranteeing that each anonymised address represents a
   unique original address.  The random permutation does not preserve
   any structural information about a network, but it does preserve the
   unique count of IP addresses.  Any application that requires more
   structure than host-uniqueness will not be able to use randomly
   permuted IP addresses.

5.1.3.  Prefix-preserving Pseudonymisation

   Prefix-preserving pseudonymisation is a direct substitution
   technique, further restricted such that the structure of subnets is



Boschi & Trammell        Expires October 1, 2009                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft        IP Flow Anonymisation Support           March 2009


   preserved at each level while anonymising IP addresses.  If two real
   IP addresses match on a prefix of "n" bits, the two anonymised IP
   addresses will match on a prefix of "n" bits as well.  This is useful
   when relationships among networks must be preserved for a given
   analysis task, but introduces structure into the anonymised data
   which can be exploited in attacks against the anonymisation
   technique.

5.2.  Timestamp Anonymisation

   The particular time at which a flow began or ended is not
   particularly identifiable information, but it can be used as part of
   attacks against other anonymisation techniques or for user profiling.
   Presice timestamps can be used in injected-traffic fingerprinting
   attacks [CITE] as well as to identify certain activity by response
   delay and size fingerprinting [CITE].  Therefore, timestamp
   information may be anonymised in order to ensure the protection of
   the entire dataset.

          +-----------------------+----------------------------+
          | Scheme                | Action                     |
          +-----------------------+----------------------------+
          | Precision Degradation | Generalisation             |
          | Enumeration           | Direct or Set Substitution |
          | Random Shifts         | Direct Substitution        |
          +-----------------------+----------------------------+

5.2.1.  Precision Degradation

   Precision Degradation is a generalisation technique that removes the
   most precise components of a timestamp, accounting all events
   occurring in each given interval (e.g. one millisecond for
   millisecond level degradation) as simultaneous.  This has the effect
   of potentially collapsing many timestamps into one.  With this
   technique time precision is reduced, and sequencing may be lost, but
   the information at which time the event occurred is preserved.  The
   anonymised data may not be generally useful for applications which
   require strict sequencing of flows.

   Note that flow meters with low time precision (e.g. second precision,
   or millisecond precision on high-capacity networks) perform the
   equivalent of precision degradation anonymisation by their design.

   Note also that degradation to a very low precision (e.g. on the order
   of minutes, hours, or days) is commonly used in analyses operating on
   time-series aggregated data, and is referred to binning; though the
   time scales are longer and applicability more restricted, this is in
   principle the same operation.

   Precision degradation to infinitely low precision is equivalent to
   black-marker anonymisation.  Removal of timestamp information is only
   recommended for analysis tasks which have no need to separate flows
   in time, for example for counting total volumes or unique occurrences
   of other flow keys in an entire dataset.

5.2.2.  Enumeration

   Enumeration is a substitution function that retains the chronological
   order in which events occurred while eliminating time information.
   Timestamps are substituted by equidistant timestamps (or numbers)
   starting from a randomly chosen start value.  The resulting data is
   useful for applications requiring strict sequencing, but not for
   those requiring good timing information (e.g. delay- or jitter-
   measurement for QoS applications or SLA validation).

5.2.3.  Random Time Shifts

   Random time shifts add a random offset to every timestamp within a
   dataset.  This reversible substitution technique therefore retains
   duration and inter-event interval information as well as
   chronological order of flows.  It is primarily intended to defeat
   traffic injection fingerprinting attacks.

5.3.  Counter Anonymisation

   Counters (such as packet and octet volumes per flow) are subject to
   fingerprinting and injection attacks against anonymisation, or for
   user profiling as timestamps are.  Counter anonymisation can help
   defeat these attacks, but are only usable for analysis tasks for
   which relative or imprecise magnitudes of activity are useful.

          +-----------------------+----------------------------+

5.3.1.  Precision Degradation

   As with precision degradation in timestamps, precision degradation of
   counters removes lower-order bits of the counters, treating all the
   counters in a given range as having the same value.  Depending on the
   precision reduction, this loses information about the relationships
   between sizes of similarly-sized flows, but keeps relative magnitude
   information.

5.3.2.  Binning

   Binning can be seen as a special case of precision degradation; the
   operation is identical, except for in precision degradation the
   counter ranges are uniform, and in binning they need not be.  For
   example, a common counter binning scheme for packet counters could be
   to bin values 1-2 together, and 3-infinity together, thereby
   separating potentially completely-opened TCP connections from
   unopened ones.  Binning schemes are generally chosen to keep
   precisely the amount of information required in a counter for a given
   analysis task.  Note that, also unlike precision degradation, the bin
   label need not be within the bin's range.

   Binning counters to a single bin 0-infinity, or alternately precision
   degradation to infinitely low precision, is equivalent to black-
   marker anonymisation.  Removal of counter information is only
   recommended for analysis tasks which have no need to evaluate the
   removed counter, for example for counting only unique occurrences of
   other flow keys.

5.3.3.  Random Noise Addition

   Random noise addition adds a random amount to a counter in each flow;
   this is used to keep relative magnitude information and minimize the
   disruption to size relationship information while avoiding
   fingerprinting attacks against anonymisation.  Note that there is no
   guarantee that random noise addition will maintain ranking order by a
   counter among members of a set.  Random noise addition is
   particularly useful when the derived analysis data will not be
   presented in such a way as to require the lower-order bits of the
   counters.

5.4.  Anonymisation of Other Flow Fields

   Other fields, particularly port numbers and protocol numbers, can be
   used to partially identify the applications that generated the
   traffic in a a given flow trace.  This information can be used in
   fingerprinting attacks, and may be of interest on its own (e.g., to
   reveal that a certain application with suspected vulnerabilities is
   running on a given network).  These fields are generally anonymised
   using one of two techniques.

5.4.1.  Binning

   Binning is a generalisation technique mapping a set of potentially
   non-uniform ranges into a set of abritrarily labeled bins.  Common
   bin arrangements depend on the field type and the analysis
   application.  For example, an IP protocol bin arrangement may
   preserve 1, 6, and 17 for ICMP, UDP, and TCP traffic, and bin all
   other protocols into a single bin, to mitigate the use of uncommon
   protocols in fingerprinting attacks.  Another example arrangement may
   bin source and destination ports into low (0-1023) and high (1024-
   65535) bins in order to tell service from ephemeral ports without
   identifying individual applications.

   Binning other flow key fields to a single bin is equivalent to black-
   marker anonymisation.  Removal of other flow key information is only
   recommended for analysis tasks which have no need to differentiate
   flows on the removed keys, for example for total traffic counts or
   unique counts of other flow keys.

5.4.2.  Random Permutation

   Random permutation is a direct substitution technique, replacing each
   key value with an value randomly selected from the set of possible
   range, guaranteeing that each anonymised value represents a unique
   original value.  This is used to preserve the count of unique flow
   key values without preserving information about the keys themselves.


6.  Parameters for the Description of Anonymisation Techniques

   This section details the abstract parameters used to describe the
   anonymisation techniques examined in the previous section, on a per-
   parameter basis.  These parameters and their export safety inform the
   design of the IPFIX anonymisation metadata export specified in the
   following section.

6.1.  Stability

   Any given anonymisation technique may be applied with a varying range
   of stability.  Stability is important for assessing the comparability
   of anonymised information in different data sets, or in the same data
   set over different time periods.  In general, stability ranges from
   completely stable to completely unstable; however, note that the
   completely unstable case is indistinguishable from black-marker
   anonymisation.  A completely stable anonymisation will always map a
   given value in the real space to the same value in the anonymised
   space.  In practice, an anonymisation may also be stable for every
   data set published by an a particular producer to a particular



Boschi & Trammell        Expires October 1, 2009               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft        IP Flow Anonymisation Support           March 2009


   consumer, stable for a stated time period within a dataset or across
   datasets, or stable only for a single data set.

   If no information about stability is available, users of anonymised
   data may assume that the techniques used are stable across the entire
   dataset, but unstable across datasets.  Note that stability presents
   a risk-utility tradeoff, as completely stable anonymisation can be
   used for longer-term trend analysis tasks but also presents more risk
   of attack given the stable mapping.

6.2.  Truncation Length

   Truncation and precision degradation are described by the truncation
   length, or the amount of data still remaining in the anonymised field
   after anonymisation.

   Truncation length can be inferred from a given data set, and need not
   be specially exported or protected.

6.3.  Bin Map

   Binning is described by the specification of a bin mapping function.
   This function can be generally expressed in terms of an associative
   array that maps each point in the original space to a bin, although
   from an implementation standpoint most bin functions are much simpler
   and more efficient.

   Since knowledge of the bin mapping function can be used to partially
   deanonymise binned data, depending on the degree of generalisation,
   no information about the bin mapping function should be exported.

6.4.  Permutation

   Like binning, permutation is described by the specification of a
   permutation function.  In the general case, this can be expressed in
   terms of an associative array that maps each point in the original
   space to a point in the anonymised space.  Unlike binning, each point
   in the anonymised space must correspond to a single, unique point in
   the original space.

   Since knowledge of the permutation function can be used to completely
   deanonymise permuted data, no information about the permutation
   function or its parameters should be exported.

6.5.  Shift Amount

   Shifting requires an amount to shift each value by.  Since the shift
   amount can be used to deanonymize data protected by shifting, no



Boschi & Trammell        Expires October 1, 2009               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft        IP Flow Anonymisation Support           March 2009


   information about the shift amount should be exported.


7.  Anonymisation Export Support in IPFIX

   Anonymised data exported via IPFIX SHOULD be annotated with
   anonymisation metadata, which details which fields described by which
   Templates are anonymised, and provides appropriate information on the
   anonymisation techniques used.  This metadata SHOULD be exported in
   Data Records described by the recommended Options Templates described
   in this section; these Options Templates use the additional
   Information Elements described in the following subsection.

   Note that fields anonymised using the black-marker (removal)
   technique do not require any special metadata support.  Black-marker
   anonymised fields SHOULD NOT be exported at all; the absence of the
   field in a given Data Set is implicitly declared by not including the
   corresponding Information Element in the Template describing that
   Data Set; exporting "empty" data elements is inefficient and in the
   general case impossible, as many non-counter Information Elements do
   not have semantically distinct null values.

7.1.  Anonymisation Options Template

   The Anonymisation Options Template describes anonymisation records,
   which allow anonymisation metadata to be exported inline over IPFIX
   or stored in an IPFIX File, by binding information about
   anonymisation techniques to Information Elements within defined
   Templates.  IPFIX Exporting Processes SHOULD export anonymisation
   records for any Template describing exported anonymised Data Records;
   IPFIX Collecting Processes and processes downstream from them MAY use
   anonymisation records to treat anonymised data differently depending
   on the applied technique.

   An Exporting Process SHOULD export anonymisation records after the
   Templates they describe have been exported, and SHOULD export
   anonymisation records reliably.

   Anonymisation records, like Templates, MUST be handled by Collecting
   Processes as scoped to the Transport Session in which they are sent.
   While the anonymisationStability IE can be used to declare that a
   given anonymisation technique's mapping will remain stable across
   multiple sessions, each session MUST re-export the anonymisation
   Records along with the templates.

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: Multiple anon. techniques applied on an IE at the
   same time is indicated with multiple elements of the same type (in
   application order as in PSAMP).  Need to verify this is actually

8.  Applying Anonymisation Techniques to IPFIX Export and Storage

   When exporting or storing anonymised flow data using IPFIX, certain
   interactions between the IPFIX Protocol and the anonymisation
   techniques in use must be considered; these are treated in the
   subsections below.

8.1.  Arrangement of Processes in IPFIX Anonymisation

   Anonymisation may be applied to IPFIX data at three stages within a
   the collection infrastructure: on initial export, at a mediator, or
   after collection, as shown in Figure 1.  Each of these locations has
   specific considerations and applicability.

                Figure 1: Potential Anonymisation Locations

   Anonymisation is generally performed before the wider dissemination
   or repurposing of a flow data set, e.g., adapting operational
   measurement data for research.  Therefore, direct anonymisation of
   flow data on initial export is only applicable in certain restricted
   circumstances: when the Exporting Process is "publishing" data to a
   Collecting Process directly, and the Exporting Process and Collecting
   Process are operated by different entities.  Note that certain
   guidelines in Section 8.2.2 with respect to timestamp anonymisation
   may not apply in this case, as the Collecting Process may be able to

   deduce certain timing information from the time at which each Message
   is received.

   A much more flexible arrangement is to anonymise data within a
   Mediator [I-D.ietf-ipfix-mediators-framework].  Here, original data
   is sent to a Mediator, which performs the anonymisation function and
   re-exports the anonymised data.  Such a Mediator could be located at
   the administrative domain boundary of the initial Exporting Process
   operator, exporting anonymised data to other consumers outside the
   organisation.  In this case, the original Exporter SHOULD use TLS as
   specified in [RFC5101] to secure the channel to the Mediator, and the
   Mediator should follow the guidelines in Section 8.2, to mitigate the
   risk of original data disclosure.

   When data is to be published as an anonymised data set in an IPFIX
   File [I-D.ietf-ipfix-file], the anonymisation may be done at the
   final Collecting Process before storage and dissemination, as well.
   In this case, the Collector should follow the guidelines in
   Section 8.2, especially as regards File-specific Options in
   Section 8.2.3

   Note that anonymisation may occur at more than one location within a
   given collection infrastructure, to provide varying levels of
   anonymisation reversal risk and utility for specific purposes.

8.2.  IPFIX-Specific Anonymisation Guidelines

   In implementing and deploying the anonymisation techniques described
   in this document, care must be taken that data structures supporting
   the operation of the protocol itself do not leak data that could be
   used to reverse the anonymisation applied to the flow data.  Such
   data structures may appear in the header, or within the data stream
   itself, especially as options data.  Each of these and their impact
   on specific anonymisation techniques is noted in a separate
   subsection below.

8.2.1.  Appropriate Use of Information Elements for Anonymised Data

   [TODO: reiterate black-marker guidelines here]

   [TODO: note that precision degradation SHOULD use appropriately-sized
   fields]

8.2.2.  Anonymisation of Header Data

   Each IPFIX Message contains a Message Header; within this Message
   Header are contained two fields which may be used to break certain
   anonymisation techniques: the Export Time, and the Observation Domain

   ID

   Export of IPFIX Messages containing anonymised timestamp data where
   the original Export Time Message header has some relationship to the
   anonymised timestamps SHOULD anonymise the Export Time header field
   using an equivalent technique, if possible.  Otherwise, relationships
   between export and flow time could be used to partially or totally
   reverse timestamp anonymisation.

   The similarity in size between an Observation Domain ID and an IPv4
   address (32 bits) may lead to a temptation to use an IPv4 interface
   address on the Metering or Exporting Process as the Observation
   Domain ID.  If this address bears some relation to the IP addresses
   in the flow data (e.g., shares a network prefix with internal
   addresses) and the IP addresses in the flow data are anonymised in a
   structure-preserving way, then the Observation Domain ID may be used
   to break the IP address anonymisation.  Use of an IPv4 interface
   address on the Metering or Exporting Process as the Observation
   Domain ID is NOT RECOMMENDED in this case.

8.2.3.  Anonymisation of Options Data

   IPFIX uses the Options mechanism to export, among other things,
   metadata about exported flows and the flow collection infrastructure.
   As with the IPFIX Message Header, certain Options recommended in
   [RFC5101] and the IPFIX File Format [I-D.ietf-ipfix-file] containing
   flow timestamps and network addresses of Exporting and Collecting
   Processes may be used to break certain anonymisation techniques; care
   should be taken while using them with anonymised data export and
   storage.

   The Exporting Process Reliability Statistics Options Template,
   recommended in [RFC5101], contains an Exporting Process ID field,
   which may be an exportingProcessIPv4Address Information Element or an
   exportingProcessIPv6Address Information Element.  If the Exporting
   Process address bears some relation to the IP addresses in the flow
   data (e.g., shares a network prefix with internal addresses) and the
   IP addresses in the flow data are anonymised in a structure-
   preserving way, then the Exporting Process address may be used to
   break the IP address anonymisation.  Exporting Processes exporting
   anonymised data in this situation SHOULD mitigate the risk of attack
   either by omitting Options described by the Exporting Process
   Reliability Statistics Options Template, or by anonymising the
   Exporting Process address using a similar technique to that used to
   anonymise the IP addresses in the exported data.

   Similarly, the Export Session Details Options Template and Message
   Details Options Template specified for the IPFIX File Format

   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-file] may contain the exportingProcessIPv4Address
   Information Element or the exportingProcessIPv6Address Information
   Element to identify an Exporting Process from which a flow record was
   received, and the collectingProcessIPv4Address Information Element or
   the collectingProcessIPv6Address Information Element to identify the
   Collecting Process which received it.  If the Exporting Process or
   Collecting Process address bears some relation to the IP addresses in
   the flow data (e.g., shares a network prefix with internal addresses)
   and the IP addresses in the flow data are anonymised in a structure-
   preserving way, then the Exporting Process or Collecting Process
   address may be used to break the IP address anonymisation.  Since
   these Options Templates are primarily intended for storing IPFIX
   Transport Session data for auditing, replay, and testing purposes, it
   is NOT RECOMMENDED that storage of anonymised data include these
   Options Templates in order to mitigate the risk of attack.

   The Message Details Options Template specified for the IPFIX File
   Format [I-D.ietf-ipfix-file] also contains the
   collectionTimeMilliseconds Information Element.  As with the Export
   Time Message Header field, if the exported flow data contains
   anonymised timestamp information, and the collectionTimeMilliseconds
   Information Element in a given Message has some relationship to the
   anonymised timestamp information, then this relationship can be
   exploited to reverse the timestamp anonymisation.  Since this Options
   Template is primarily intended for storing IPFIX Transport Session
   data for auditing, replay, and testing purposes, it is NOT
   RECOMMENDED that storage of anonymised data include this Options
   Template in order to mitigate the risk of attack.

   Since the Time Window Options Template specified for the IPFIX File
   Format [I-D.ietf-ipfix-file] refers to the timestamps within the flow
   data to provide partial table of contents information for an IPFIX
   File, care must be taken to ensure that Options described by this
   template are written using the anonymised timestamps instead of the
   original ones.
