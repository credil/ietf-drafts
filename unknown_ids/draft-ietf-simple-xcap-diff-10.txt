Internet-Draft              XCAP Diff Format                   June 2009


Abstract

   This specification defines a document format that can be used to
   indicate that a change has occurred in a document managed by the
   Extensible Markup Language (XML) Configuration Access Protocol
   (XCAP).  This format indicates the document that has changed and its
   former and new entity tags.  It also can indicate the specific change
   that was made in the document, using an XML patch format.  This
   format allows also indications of element and attribute content of an
   XML document.  XCAP diff documents can be delivered to clients using
   a number of means, including a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   event package.

Internet-Draft              XCAP Diff Format                   June 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Extensible Markup Language (XML) Configuration Access Protocol
   (XCAP) [RFC4825] is a protocol that allows clients to manipulate XML
   documents stored on a server.  These XML documents serve as
   configuration information for application protocols.  As an example,
   resource list [RFC4662] subscriptions (also known as presence lists)
   allow a client to have a single SIP subscription to a list of users,
   where the list is maintained on a server.  The server will obtain
   presence for those users and report it back to the client.  This
   application requires the server, called a Resource List Server (RLS),
   to have access to the list of presentities.  This list needs to be
   manipulated by clients so they can add and remove their friends as
   they desire.

   Complexities arise when multiple clients attempt to simultaneously
   manipulate a document, such as a presence list.  Frequently, a client
   will keep a copy of the current list in memory, so it can render it
   to users.  However, if another client modifies the document, the
   cached version becomes stale.  This modification event must be made
   known to all clients which have cached copies of the document, so
   that they can fetch the most recent one.

   To deal with this problem, clients can use a Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] event package [RFC3265] to subscribe to
   change events in XCAP documents.  This notification needs to indicate
   the specific resource that changed, and how it changed.  One solution
   for the format of such a change notification would be a content
   indirection object [RFC4483].  Though content indirection can tell a
   client that a document has changed, it provides it with MIME
   Content-ID indicating the new version of the document.  The MIME
   Content-ID is not the same as the entity tag, which is used by XCAP
   for document versioning.  As such, a client cannot easily ascertain
   whether an indication of a change in a document is due to a change it
   just made, or due to a change another client made at around the same
   time.  Furthermore, content indirections don't indicate how a
   document changed; they would only be able to indicate that it did
   change.

   To resolve these problems, this document defines a data format which
   can convey the fact that an XML document managed by XCAP has changed.
   This data format is an XML document format, called an XCAP diff
   document.  This format can indicate that a document has changed, and
   provide its previous and new entity tags.  It can also optionally
   include a set of patch operations [RFC5261], which indicate how to
   transform the document from the version prior to the change, to the
   version after it.  XML element and attribute content of XCAP
   documents can also be delivered with this format.

Internet-Draft              XCAP Diff Format                   June 2009


   XML documents that are equivalent for the purposes of many
   applications may differ in their physical representation.  Similar to
   XCAP, the canonical form with comments [W3C.REC-xml-c14n-20010315] of
   an XML document determines the logical equivalence when this format
   is used to patch XML documents.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

   This specification also defines the following additional terms:

   Document:  When the term document is used without the "XCAP diff" in
      front of it, it refers to the XCAP document resource about whom
      the XCAP diff document is reporting a change.

   XCAP diff document:  The XML document defined by this specification
      that reports on a set of changes in an XCAP document resource.

   Server:  Typically an XCAP server, this is a protocol entity that
      generates XCAP diff documents based on its knowledge of a set of
      XCAP documents.

   Client:  Typically an XCAP client and SIP User Agent (UA), the client
      consumes XCAP diff documents in order to reconstruct the document
      stored on the server.


3.  Structure of an XCAP Diff Document

   An XCAP diff document is an XML [W3C.REC-xml-20060816] document that
   MUST be well-formed and SHOULD be valid.  XCAP diff documents MUST be
   based on XML 1.0 and MUST be encoded using UTF-8.  This specification
   makes use of XML namespaces for identifying XCAP diff documents and
   document fragments.  The namespace URI for elements defined by this
   specification is a URN [RFC2141], using the namespace identifier
   'ietf' defined by [RFC2648] and extended by [RFC3688].  This URN is:

      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xcap-diff

   An XCAP diff document begins with the root element tag <xcap-diff>.
   This element has a single mandatory attribute, "xcap-root".  The
   value of this attribute is the XCAP root URI for the documents in
   which the changes have taken place.  A single XCAP diff document can



Rosenberg & Urpalainen  Expires December 24, 2009               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft              XCAP Diff Format                   June 2009


   only represent changes in documents within the same XCAP root.  The
   content of the <xcap-diff> element is a sequence of <document>,
   <element> and <attribute> elements followed by any number of elements
   from other namespaces for the purposes of extensibility.  Any such
   unknown elements MUST be ignored by the client.  If several
   <document> elements with the same "sel" selector value exist in the
   XCAP diff document, i.e. for example, the full ETag change history is
   indicated, the corresponding patches MUST be appliable in the given
   document order.  Each <document> element specifies changes in a
   specific document within the XCAP root.  It has one mandatory
   attribute, "sel", and a two optional attributes, "new-etag" and
   "previous-etag".  The "sel" attribute of the <document> element
   identifies the specific document within the XCAP root for which
   changes are indicated.  Its content MUST be a relative path
   reference, with the base URI being equal to the XCAP root URI.  The
   "new-etag" attribute provides the entity tag (ETag) for the document
   after the application of the changes, assuming the document exists
   after those changes.  The "previous-etag" attribute provides an
   identifier for the document instance prior to the change.  If the
   change being reported is the removal of a document, the "previous-
   etag" MUST only be included and the "new-etag" attribute will not be
   present.  The "new-etag" attribute MUST only exist alone when the
   document either exists or it was just created (no patch included).
   Both attributes are present when a patch (or series of XCAP
   operations) has been applied to the resource.  Also both attributes
   MAY be used to indicate an ETag change without any document
   modifications (patches).

   The "previous-etag" and "new-etag" need not have been sequentially
   assigned ETags at the server.  An XCAP diff document can indicate
   changes that have occurred over a series of XCAP operations.  The
   only requirement then is that, the sequence of events, when executed
   serially, will result in the transformation of the document with the
   ETag "previous-etag" to the one whose ETag is "new-etag".  Also the
   series of operations do not have to be the same exact series of
   operations that occurred at the server.

   Each <document> element contains either a sequence of patching
   instructions or an indication that the body hasn't semantically
   changed.  The latter means that the document has been assigned a new
   ETag but its content is unchanged and it is indicated by the <body-
   not-changed> element.  Patching instructions are described by the
   <add>, <replace> and <remove> elements.  These elements use the
   corresponding add, replace and remove types defined in [RFC5261], and
   define a set of patch operations that can be applied to transform the
   document.  See [RFC5261] for instructions on how this transformation
   is effected.  The <document> element can also contain elements from
   other namespaces for the purposes of extensibility.  The <add>,

   <replace> and <remove> elements allow extension attributes from any
   namespace.  Any unknown elements <document> element or attributes of
   patch operation elements MUST be ignored.

   Figure 1: <document> element content / corresponding resource changes

   Each <element> element indicates the existing element content of an
   XCAP document.  It has one mandatory attribute, "sel", and one
   optional attribute, "exists".  The "sel" attribute of the <element>
   element identifies an XML element of an XCAP document.  It is a
   percent endoced relative URI following XCAP conventions when
   selecting elements.  The XCAP Node Selector MUST always locate a
   unique node, the "exists" attribute thus shows whether an element
   exists or not in the XCAP document.  When the "exists" attribute is
   absent from the <element> element, the indicated element still exists
   in the XCAP document.  The located result element exists as a child
   element of the <element> element.  It should be noted, that only the
   full content of an element is shown if it exists, there are no
   conventions for patching these elements.  In a corner case where the
   content of this element cannot be presented for some reason, although

   it exists in the XCAP document, the <element> element MUST NOT have
   any child nodes.

   As the result XML element is typically namespace qualified, all
   needed namespace declarations MUST exist within the <xml-diff>
   document.  The possible local namespace declarations within the
   result element exist unmodified as in the source document, similar to
   XCAP conventions.  Other namespace references MUST be resolved from
   the context of the <element> or its parent elements.  The prefixes of
   qualified names (QName) [W3C.REC-xml-names-20060816] of XML nodes
   also remain as they exist originally in the source XCAP document.

   Each <attribute> element indicates the existing attribute content of
   an XCAP document.  It has one mandatory attribute, "sel", and one
   optional attribute, "exists".  The "sel" attribute of the <attribute>
   element identifies an XML attribute of an XCAP document.  It is a
   percent endoced relative URI following XCAP conventions when
   selecting attributes.  The "exists" attribute indicates whether an
   attribute exists or not in the XCAP document.  When the "exists"
   attribute is absent from the <attribute> element, the indicated
   attribute still exists in the XCAP document.  The child text node of
   the <attribute> element indicates the value of the located attribute.
   Note that if the attribute is namespace qualified, the query
   parameter of the XCAP URI indicates the attached namespace URI and
   the prefix in the XCAP source document.

   </xcap-diff>


   This indicates that the document with URI "http://xcap.example.com/
   root/resource-lists/users/sip:joe@example.com/coworkers" has changed.
   Its previous entity tag is "8a77f8d" and its new one is "7ahggs" but
   actual changes are not shown.  The <service> element exists in the
   rls-services "index" document and its full content is shown.  Note
   that the <service> element is attached with a default namespace
   declaration within the original document.  Similarly, a "uri"
   attribute content is shown from the same "index" document as an
   illustrative example.


6.  Security Considerations

   XCAP diff documents can include changes from one document to another.
   As a consequence, if the document itself is sensitive and requires
   confidentiality, integrity or authentication, then the same applies
   to the XCAP diff format.  Therefore, protocols which transport XCAP
   diff documents must provide sufficient security capabilities for

   transporting the document itself.

   The SIP event package framework specified in RFC 3265 [RFC3265] is
   the most typical use-case for this format.  Then in general its
   security considerations apply, but event packages MAY also have other
   specific threats which MUST be considered on an application-by-
   application basis.


7.  IANA Considerations

   There are several IANA considerations associated with this
   specification.

7.1.  application/xcap-diff+xml MIME Type

      MIME media type name: application

      MIME subtype name: xcap-diff+xml

      Optional parameters: Same as charset parameter application/xml as
      specified in RFC 3023 [RFC3023].

      Encoding considerations: Same as encoding considerations of
      application/xml as specified in RFC 3023 [RFC3023].

      Security considerations: See Section 10 of RFC 3023 [RFC3023] and
      Section 6 of RFCXXXX [[NOTE TO RFC-EDITOR/IANA: Please replace
      XXXX with the RFC number of this specification.]].

      Interoperability considerations: none.

      Published specification: This document.

      Applications which use this media type: This document type has
      been used to support manipulation of resource lists [RFC4826]
      using XCAP.
