1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   Network elements such as firewalls are an integral aspect of a
   majority of IP networks today, given the state of security in the
   Internet, threats, and vulnerabilities to data networks.  MIPv6
   [RFC3775] defines mobility support for IPv6 nodes.  Since firewalls
   are not aware of MIPv6 protocol details, they will probably interfere
   with the smooth operation of the protocol.  The problems caused by
   firewalls to Mobile IPv6 are documented in [RFC4487].

   This document presents some recommendations for firewall
   administrators to help them configure their firewalls in a way that
   allows the Mobile IPv6 signaling and data messages to pass through.
   This document assumes that the firewalls in question include some
   kind of stateful packet filtering capability.  The static rules that
   need to be configured are described in this document.  In some
   scenarios, the support of additional mechanisms to create pinholes
   required for MIPv6 signalling and data traffic to pass through will
   be necessary.  A possible solution, describing the dynamic
   capabilities needed for the firewalls to create pinholes based on
   MIPv6 signalling traffic is described in a companion document
   [MIP6FWVENDOR].  Other solutions may also be possible.


3.  Home Agent behind a firewall

   This section presents the recommendations for configuring a firewall
   that protects a home agent.  For each type of traffic that needs to
   pass through this firewall, recommendations are presented on how to
   identify that traffic.  The following types of traffic are considered

   o  Signaling between the MN and the HA

   o  IKEv2 signaling between MN and HA for establishing SAs

   o  Data traffic from and to MN passing through the HA

Internet-Draft   MIPv6 Firewall Administrator guidelines   November 2007


3.1.  Signaling between the MN and the HA

   The signaling between the MN and HA is protected using IPSec ESP.
   These messages are critical to the MIPv6 protocol and if these
   messages are discarded, Mobile IPv6 as specified today will cease to
   work.  In order to permit these messages through, the firewall has to
   detect the messages using the following patterns.

     Destination Address: Address of HA
     Next Header: 50 (ESP)
     Mobility Header Type: 5 (BU)

     Destination Address: Address of HA
     Next Header: 50 (ESP)
     Mobility Header Type: 1 (HoTI)

   This pattern will allow the BU messages from MNs to HA to pass
   through.  It will also allow the HoTI messages (related to route
   optimization) between the MN and the HA to pass through.

3.2.  IKEv2 signaling between MN and HA for establishing SAs

   The MN and HA exchange IKEv2 signaling in order to establish the
   security associations.  The security associations so established will
   later be used for securing the mobility signaling messages.  Hence
   these messages need to be permitted to pass through the firewalls.
   The following pattern will detect these messages.

     Destination Address: Address of HA
     Transport Protocol: UDP
     Destination UDP Port: 500


3.3.  Data traffic from and to MN passing through the HA

   If a CN tries to initiate traffic to an MN, a stateful firewall would
   prevent these connection requests to pass through as there is no
   established state on the firewall.  If this is necessary to do, the
   pattern to look for is

     Destination Address: MN HoA

   Allowing this traffic might allow any kind of traffic, including
   malicious traffic, to pass through unfiltered to the MN.  This would
   expose the MN to any type of possibly malicious traffic, resulting in
   a denial of service or exploitation of known security
   vulnerabilities.  This practice is NOT RECOMMENDED.  Instead, a
   dynamically created pinhole like the one specified in [MIP6FWVENDOR]

Internet-Draft   MIPv6 Firewall Administrator guidelines   November 2007


   can be used to allow this traffic.


4.  Correspondent Node behind a firewall

   This section presents the recommendations for configuring a firewall
   if a node behind it should be able to act as Mobile IPv6 CN.  For
   each type of traffic that needs to pass through this firewall,
   recommendations are presented on how to identify that traffic.  The
   following types of traffic are considered

   o  Route optimization signaling between MN and CN through HA

   o  Route optimization signaling between MN and CN

   o  Binding Update from MN to CN

   o  Route Optimization data traffic from MN

   o  Bi-directional tunnelled data traffic from the MN to the CN
      through HA

4.1.  Route optimization signaling between MN and CN through HA

   Parts of the initial route optimization signaling has to pass through
   the HA, namely the HoTI and the HoT messages.  Without assistance,
   the HoTI message from the HA to the CN is not able to traverse the
   firewall.  The following pattern will allow these messages to
   traverse.

      Destination Address: CN Address

      Mobility Header Type: 1

   This pinhole allows the HoTI message from the HA to the CN to
   traverse the firewall.  The HoT message from the CN to the MN through
   the HA can traverse the firewall without any assistance.  Hence no
   pinhole is required.

4.2.  Route optimization signaling between MN and CN

   Route Optimization allows direct communication of data packets
   between the MN and a CN without tunnelling it back through the HA.
   To get route optimization work, the MN has to send a CoTI message
   directly to the CN, which response with a CoT message.  However, a
   stateful firewall would prevent the CoTI message to pass through as
   there is no established state on the firewall.  The following pinhole
   will allow the CoTI message to traverse.

Internet-Draft   MIPv6 Firewall Administrator guidelines   November 2007


      Destination Address: CN Address

      Mobility Header Type: 2

   The CoT message from the CN to the MN can traverse the firewall
   without any assistance.  Hence no pinhole is required.

4.3.  Binding Update from MN to CN

   After successfully performing the return routability procedure, the
   MN sends the BU to the CN and expects the BA.  Since this BU does not
   match any previous installed pinhole rules, an additional pinhole
   with the following format is required.

      Destination Address: CN Address

      Mobility Header Type: 5

   This allows the BU to traverse the firewall and the BA can pass the
   firewall without any assistance.  Therefore, the Binding Update
   sequence can be performed successfully.

4.4.  Route Optimization data traffic from MN

   Also the Route Optimization data traffic from MN directly to the CN
   can not traverse the firewall without assistance.  A dynamically
   created pinhole such as the one specified in [MIP6FWVENDOR] will
   allow this traffic to pass.

4.5.  Bi-directional tunnelled data traffic from the MN to the CN
      through HA

   If a MN tries to initiate traffic to a CN through the HA using bi-
   directional tunnelling, a stateful firewall would prevent these
   connection requests to pass through as there is no established state
   on the firewall.  This is usually a problem as CNs often provide
   services.  A solution is to static configure the firewall to let this
   traffic pass through.  However, this is only an acceptable option if
   it is not necessary to open an all-embracing pinhole, e.g. if the
   destination ports are well-known.  In this case, the pinhole has to
   look like

      Destination Address: CN Address

      Destination Port: Application Ports

   If the ports are unknown, it is necessary to install a pinhole with
   only the Destination Address as pattern.  Allowing this traffic might

   allow any kind of traffic, including malicious traffic, to traverse
   to the CN.  Allowing this traffic might allow any kind of traffic,
   including malicious traffic, to pass through unfiltered to the CN.
   This would expose the CN to any type of possibly malicious traffic,
   resulting in a denial of service or exploitation of known security
   vulnerabilities.  This practice is NOT RECOMMENDED.


5.  Mobile Node behind a firewall

   This section presents the recommendations for configuring a firewall
   that protects the network a mobile node visiting.  For each type of
   traffic that needs to pass through this firewall, recommendations are
   presented on how to identify that traffic.  The following types of
   traffic are considered

   o  Signaling between MN and HA

   o  Route Optimization Signaling between MN and CN

   o  IKEv2 signaling between MN and HA for establishing SAs

5.1.  Signaling between MN and HA

   As described in Section 3.1, the signaling between the MN and HA is
   protected using IPSec ESP.  Currently, a lot of firewalls are
   configured to block the incoming ESP packets.  Moreover, from the
   view of the firewall, both source and destination addresses of these
   messages from/to mobile node are variable.  Fortunately, for a
   stateful firewall, if the initial traffic is allowed through the
   firewall, then the return traffic is also allowed.  A mobile node is
   always the initiator for the BU.  Since MN's CoA is not able to be
   known in advance, the firewall can use following patterns to permit
   these messages through.

     Source Address: Visited subnet prefix

     Destination Address: Address of HA
     Next Header: 50 (ESP)
     Mobility Header Type: 1 (HoTI)

     Source Address: Visited subnet prefix

     Destination Address: Address of HA
     Next Header: 50 (ESP)
     Mobility Header Type: 5 (BU)

   This pattern will allow the initial packets (e.g.  BU from MNs to HA,



Krishnan, et al.          Expires May 21, 2008                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft   MIPv6 Firewall Administrator guidelines   November 2007


   HoTI, etc.) to pass through the firewall.  Then the return packets
   (BA from HA to MN, HoT) is also able to pass through accordingly.

5.2.  Signaling between MN and CN

   Route Optimization allows direct communication of data packets
   between the MN and a CN without tunneling it back through the HA.  It
   includes 3 pairs of messages: HoTI/HoT, CoTI/CoT and BU/BA.  The
   first pair can pass through the firewall using the pattern described
   in section 5.1.  Here we discuss CoTI/CoT and BU/BA messages.
   Following pattern permits these messages through the firewall.

   Source Address: Visited subnet prefix
     Mobility Header Type: 2 (CoTI)

   Source Address: Visited subnet prefix
     Mobility Header Type: 5 (BU)

   This pattern allows the initial messages (CoTI and BU) from the MN to
   the CN pass through the firewall.  The return messages (CoT and BA)
   from the CN to the MN can also passes through the firewall
   accordingly.

5.3.  IKEv2 signaling between MN and HA for establishing SAs

   The MN and HA exchange IKEv2 signaling in order to establish the
   security associations.  The security associations so established will
   later be used for securing the mobility signaling messages.  Due to
   variable source/destination IP addresses and MN always as initiator,
   the following pattern will let the negotiation pass.

   Source Address: Visited subnet prefix
   Transport Protocol: UDP
   Destination UDP Port: 500

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA action.


8.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies recommendations for firewall administrators
   to allow Mobile IPv6 traffic to pass through unhindered.  Since some
   of this traffic is encrypted it is not possible for firewalls to
   discern whether it is safe or not.  This document recommends a
   liberal setting so that all legitimate traffic can pass.  This means
   that some malicious traffic may be permitted by these rules.  These
   rules may allow the initiation of Denial of Service attacks against
   Mobile IPv6 capable nodes (the MNs, CNs and the HAs).  Especially the
   rules specified in Section 3.3 and Section 4.5 are broadly defined
   and hence possess the most potential for abuse.  Hence, if these
   rules are implemented, the firewalls SHOULD be configured to rate-
   limit such traffic on a per-destination basis.  This would allow the
   firewall to mitigate possible denial of service attacks on the
   endpoints.  Please note that such measures would not mitigate other
   potential security issues.
