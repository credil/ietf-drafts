    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the Namespace Identifier (NID) for Uniform Resource Namespace (URN) resources published by Cable Television Laboratories Inc. (CableLabs). CableLabs publishes specifications that define unique and persistent resources that make use of the cablelabs URN namespace.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
		CableLabs is a non-profit research and development consortium that is
		dedicated to pursuing new cable telecommunications technologies and
		to helping its cable operator members integrate those technical
		advancements into their business objectives.  Within CableLabs,
		specification activities are organized into projects such as
		DOCSIS(r), PacketCable(tm), and OpenCable(tm), and technical work is
		conducted in focus teams.  Product vendors, manufacturers, and cable
		operator members are invited to join the focus teams that create
		technical specifications. 
	</t>
	<t>
		From time to time, some specifications developed by CableLabs require a URN namespace to uniquely identify resources.  CableLabs manages these resource assignments prior to specification publication and ensures they are both unique and persistent.
	</t>
	<t>
		This document defines a full and complete NID registration that follows  <xref target="RFC3406"></xref> for the purpose of having unique and persistent namespace definitions in CableLabs specifications.
	</t>
    </section>

    <section title="URN Specification for CableLabs">
		<t>
			Namespace ID:
			<list hangIndent="5">
				<t>The NID "cablelabs" is requested.</t>
			</list>
		</t>
		<t>
			Registration Information:
			<list hangIndent="5">
				<t>registration version number: 1
				<vspace blankLines="0"/>
				registration date: 2008-07-02</t>
			</list>
		</t>

			Declared registrant of the namespace:
			<list hangIndent="5">
				<t>Registering organization</t>
			</list>
			<list hangIndent="8">
				<t>Name:    Cable Television Laboratories Inc.
				<vspace blankLines="0"/>
				Address: 858 Coal Creek Circle, Louisville, CO 80027, USA</t>

				<vspace blankLines="0"/>
				Email: ietf-standards@cablelabs.com</t>
			</list>
		</t>
		<t>
			Declaration of syntactic structure:
			<list hangIndent="5">
				<t>
					The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the "cablelabs" NID will have the following structure: urn:cablelabs:{CLresource}:{CLResourceSpecificString} where the "CLresource" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to the URN syntax requirements <xref target="RFC2141"></xref> and defines a specific class of resource type.  Each resource type has a specific labeling scheme that is covered by "CLResourceSpecificString", which also conforms to the naming requirements of <xref target="RFC2141"></xref>.
				</t>
				<t>
				CableLabs maintains the CableLabs Assigned Names and Numbers <xref target="CANN"></xref> specification that will contain the assignment of "CLresources" and the specific registration values assigned for each resource class.
				</t>
			</list>
		</t>
		<t>Relevant ancillary documentation:
			<list hangIndent="5">
				<t>
					CableLabs publishes information on the registered resources in the <xref target="CANN"></xref> specification available at: http://www.cablelabs.com/specifications/cpSpecs.html
				</t>
			</list>
		</t>
		<t>Identifier uniqueness considerations:
			<list hangIndent="5">
				<t>
					CableLabs will manage  resources using the "cablelabs" NID and will be the authority for managing the resources and subsequent strings associated.  CableLabs is expected to guarantee the uniqueness of the strings themselves or it may permit secondary responsibility for certain defined resources.
				</t>
				<t>
					CableLabs could allow the use of experimental type values for testing purposes only. Note that using experimental types may create collisions as multiple users may use the same values for resources and specific strings.
				</t>
			</list>
		</t>	
		<t>Identifier persistence considerations:
			<list hangIndent="5">
				<t>
					CableLabs will update the <xref target="CANN"></xref> specification to document the registered resources in the "cableLabs" NID.
				</t>
			</list>
		</t>
		<t>Process of identifier assignment:
			<list hangIndent="5">
				<t>
					CableLabs  will provide procedures for registration of each type of resource that it maintains.  Each such resource may have three types of registration activities:
				</t>
			</list>
			<list hangIndent="8">
				<t>1. Registered values associated with CableLabs documents or services
				<vspace blankLines="0"/>
				2. Registration of values or sub-trees to other entities
				<vspace blankLines="0"/>
				3. Name models for use in experimental purposes</t>
			</list>
		</t>
		
		<t> Process for identifier resolution:
			<list hangIndent="5">
				<t>
					The namespace is not listed with a resolution discovery system; this is not applicable for this URN registration.
				</t>
			</list>
		</t>
		
		<t> Rules for Lexical Equivalence:
			<list hangIndent="5">
				<t>No special considerations; the rules for lexical equivalence of <xref target="RFC2141"></xref> apply.
				</t>
			</list>
		</t>
		
		<t> Conformance with URN Syntax:
			<list hangIndent="5">
				<t>No special considerations.</t>
			</list>
		</t>
		
		<t> Validation mechanism:
			<list hangIndent="5">
				<t>None specified.  URN assignment will be handled by procedures implemented in support of CableLabs activities.
				</t>
			</list>
		</t>				

		<t> Scope:
			<list hangIndent="5">
				<t>Global</t>
			</list>

    <?rfc needLines="8" ?>

    <section title="Example">
      <t>The following example represents an hypothetical URN that could be assigned by Cablelabs.</t>
	  <t>urn:cablelabs:packetcable-example:ue:rst-sample</t>
      <t>Defines the URN to be used for the User Equipment (UE) implementing the  sample Residential SIP Telephony Application (RST) defined in the Packetcable specifications.</t>
    </section>

   <section title="Namespace Considerations">
      <t>CableLabs develops specifications that may require the use of data models.</t>
      <t>URN Namespaces are key constructs to manage the definitions of those data models reliably with persistence and uniqueness.</t>
      <t/>
	  <t>The use of URNs should also help specification authors to maintain different versions of URNs and dependencies between urns, across different versions of CableLabs specifications if they so wish.</t>
    </section>

   <section title="Community Considerations">
      <t>The CableLabs specifications are publicly available or licensed to manufacturers in a nondiscriminatory basis.</t>
      <t>CableLabs will maintain the allocation of resources for the "cablelabs" NID and maintain updated the corresponding specifications where those resources are referenced or used.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>The requested NID has been entered into the IANA registry for URN NIDs.  The update can be found at: http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces and any associated mirrors.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>There are no additional security considerations other than those normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.</t>
