Abstract

   The IETF emergency services architecture assumes that access to a
   network has already happened using the traditional network access
   authentication procedures or that no authentication for network
   access is needed (e.g., in case of public hotspots).  Subsequent
   protocol interactions, such as obtaining location information,
   learning the address of the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) and

   the emergency call itself are largely decoupled from the underlying
   network access procedures.

   There are, however, cases where a device is not in possession of
   credentials for network access, does not have a VoIP provider, or
   where the credentials are available but became invalid due to various
   reasons (e.g., credit exhaustion, expired accounts, etc.).

   This document provides a problem statement, introduces terminology
   and describes an extension for the base IETF emergency services
   architecture.

1.  Introduction

   Summoning police, the fire department or an ambulance in emergencies
   is one of the fundamental and most-valued functions of the telephone.
   As telephone functionality moves from circuit-switched telephony to
   Internet telephony, its users rightfully expect that this core
   functionality will continue to work at least as well as it has for
   the older technology.  New devices and services are being made
   available that could be used to make a request for help, which are
   not traditional telephones, and users are increasingly expecting them
   to be used to place emergency calls.

   Based on the communication model of the Session Initiation Protocol
   (SIP) as excercised in the IETF it is not necessary to deploy SIP
   entities in access networks (or associated to them).  Instead, VoIP
   provider may deploy their SIP entities at any place on the Internet.
   The IETF emergency services architecture acknowledges this deployment
   model and even goes a step further by recognizing that there are
   potentially other, non-SIP VoIP providers, that might want to offer
   emergency service support to their customers.  Hence, the interaction
   between a SIP User Agent and its VoIP provider does not need to be
   standardized although [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp] provides best current
   practise recommendations regarding the usage of certain features as
   excercised in the case of SIP.

   This flexibility has implications for the architecture but allows
   access networks to be application layer agnostic.  Furthermore, since
   the normal VoIP communication exchanges do not traverse these
   entities in the access network it is quite likely that
   interoperability problems will occur especially in an emergency case.

   There are essentially three environments that need to be considered
   (and the terms are described in Section 3):

   1.  Emergency Services with non-service-initialized devices
   2.  Unauthenticated Emergency Services
   3.  Unauthorized Emergency Service

   The implications of un-initialized device, scenario (1) for emergency
   services are ignored in this specification.  Scenario (2) is quite
   likely and therefore the main focus of this document.  Scenario (3)
   is relevant to this specification if the outcome of the lack of
   authorization leads to falling back to a scenario where no valid
   credentials are assumed.

   In all these cases it is not possible to place an emergency call as
   envisioned in the IETF emergency services architecture, described in
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework], unless the ISP grants access to certain

   entities (as described in Section 4) or the ISP extends the emergency
   services architecture (as described in Section 5).


2.  A Warning Note

   At the time of writing there is no regulation in place that demands
   the functionality described in this memo.  SDOs have started their
   work on this subject in a proactive fashion in the anticipation that
   national regulation will demand it for a subset of network
   environments.

   There are also indications that the functionality of unauthenticated
   emergency calls (called SIM-less calls) in today's cellular system in
   certain countries leads to a fair amount of hoaks or test calls.
   This causes overload situations at PSAPs with .

      As an example, Federal Office of Communications (OFCOM,
      Switzerland) provided statistics about 112 calls in Switzerland
      from Jan. 1997 to Nov. 2001.  Switzerland did not offer SIM-less
      emergency calls except for almost a month in July 2000 where a
      significant increase in hoaks and test calls was reported.  As a
      consequence, the functionality was disabled again.  More details
      can be found in the panel presentations of the 3rd SDO Emergency
      Services Workshop [esw07].


3.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   This document introduces the following new terms:

   Un-initialized Device:

      A device without VoIP client software.

   Non-Service-Initialized Device:

      A device for which there is no valid service contract with a
      provider of the services.  Other terms: "un-activated", "un-
      provisioned", or "unbranded" device.

Internet-Draft      Unauthenticated Emergency Service          July 2008


   Unauthenticated Emergency Service:

      The term "unauthenticated emergency services" refers to the case
      where an emergency caller does not have credentials (e.g., no SIM
      card, no username and password, no private key) to successfully
      complete network access authentication procedures or to use a VoIP
      service or both.

      The case of no credentials for network access is likely case in
      enterprise networks, home networks, or governmental networks.  In
      other cases the user might be able to obtain such credentials, for
      example in hotspots found in hotels, at airports, and in many
      coffee shops.  Unfortunately, users have to go through a lengthy
      procedure (often involving captive portals) to obtain a temporary
      account in exchange of money.  In emergency situations it is
      certainly not desirable to let the user find their way through a
      number of webpages and to type-in their credit card details.

      It is important to differentiate between the unavailability of
      credentials for network access and for VoIP access as the network
      provider and the VoIP provider are often distinct entities and
      therefore the user might have different credentials with the two.

   Unauthorized Emergency Service:

      The term "unauthorized emergency services" refers to the case
      where a device aims to attach to the network or to use a VoIP
      service but the authorization procedure fails.  The authorization
      step may fail as a consequence of triggering different procedures
      (such as network access authentication or registration at the VoIP
      providers registrar).  Still, the device is granted (limited)
      access to perform emergency calling.  It is important to
      differentiate between network operator and VoIP provider as they
      often refer to different parties and therefore the authorization
      decision might be executed by a different backend infrastructure.

      Lack of authorization might be caused by a number of reasons,
      including credit exhaustion, expired accounts, locked account,
      missing access rights (e.g., access to the competitors enterprise
      network), etc.


   This document reuses terminology from [I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps]
   and [RFC5012], namely Internet Access Provider (IAP), Internet
   Service Provider (ISP), Application Service Provider (ASP), Voice
   Service Provider (VSP), Emergency Service Routing Proxy (ESRP),
   Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP), Location Configuration Server
   (LCS), (emergency) service dial string, and (emergency) service

4.  Considerations for ISPs to support Unauthenticated Emergency
    Services without Architecture Extensions

   On a very high-level, the steps to be performed by an end host not
   being attached to the network and the user starting to make an
   emergency call are the following:

   o  Some radio networks have added support for unauthenticated
      emergency access, some other type of networks advertise these
      capabilities using layer beacons.  The end host learns about these
      unauthenticated emergency services capabilities either from the
      link layer type or from advertisement.
   o  The end host uses the link layer specific network attachment
      procedures defined for unauthenticated network access in order to
      get access to emergency services.
   o  When the link layer network attachment procedure is completed the
      end host learns basic configuration information using DHCP from
      the ISP, including the address of the LoST server.
   o  The end host MUST use a Location Configuration Protocol (LCP)
      supported by the IAP or ISP to learn its own location.
   o  The end host MUST use the LoST protocol [I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost] to
      query the LoST server and ask for the PSAP URI responsible for
      that location.
   o  After the PSAP URI has been returned to the end host, the SIP UA
      in the end host directly initiates a SIP INVITE towards the PSAP
      URI.

   The IAP and the ISP will probably want to make sure that the claimed
   emergency caller indeed performs an emergency call rather than using
   the network for other purposes, and thereby acting fraudulent by
   skipping any authentication, authorization and accounting procedures.
   By restricting access of the unauthenticated emergency caller to the
   LoST server and the PSAP URI, traffic can be restricted only to
   emergency calls.

   Using the above procedures, the unauthenticated emergency caller will
   be successful only if:

   o  the ISP (or the IAP) support an LCP that the end host can use to
      learn its location.  A list of mandatory-to-implement LCPs can be
      found in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp]).
   o  the ISP configures it's firewalls appropriately to allow emergency
      calls to traverse the network towards the PSAP.

   Some IAPs/ISPs may not be able to fulfill the above requirements.  If



Schulzrinne, et al.     Expires January 13, 2009                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      Unauthenticated Emergency Service          July 2008


   those IAPs/ISPs want to support unauthenticated emergency calls, then
   they can deploy an extended architecture as described in Section 5.


5.  Considerations for ISPs to support Unauthenticated Emergency
    Services with Architecture Extensions

   For unauthenticated emergency services support it is insufficient to
   provide mechanisms only at the link layer in order to bypass
   authentication for the cases when:

   o  the IAP/ISP does not support any Location Configuration Protocol
   o  the IAP/ISP does not have knowledge of a LoST server (which would
      assist the client to find the correct PSAP)

   A modification to the emergency services architecture is necessary
   since the IAP and the ISP need to make sure that the claimed
   emergency caller indeed performs an emergency call rather than using
   the network for other purposes, and thereby acting fraudulent by
   skipping any authentication, authorization and accounting procedures.
   Hence, without introducing some understanding of the specific
   application the ISP (and consequently the IAP) will not be able to
   detect and filter malicious activities.  This leads to the
   architecture described in Figure 1 where the IAP needs to implement
   extensions to link layer procedures for unauthenticated emergency
   service access and the ISP needs to deploy emergency services related
   entities used for call routing, such as the Emergency Services
   Routing Proxy (ESRP), a Location Configuration Server (LCS) and a
   mapping database.

   On a very high-level, the interaction is as follows starting with the
   end host not being attached to the network and the user starting to
   make an emergency call.

   o  Some radio networks have added support for unauthenticated
      emergency access, some other type of networks advertise these
      capabilities using layer beacons.  The end host learns about these
      unauthenticated emergency services capabilities either from the
      link layer type or from advertisement.
   o  The end host uses the link layer specific network attachment
      procedures defined for unauthenticated network access in order to
      get access to emergency services.
   o  When the link layer network attachment procedure is completed the
      end host learns basic configuration information using DHCP from
      the ISP, including the address of the ESRP, as shown in (2).
   o  When the IP address configuration is completed then the SIP UA
      initiates a SIP INVITE towards the indicated ESRP, as shown in
      (3).  The INVITE message contains all the necessary parameters



Schulzrinne, et al.     Expires January 13, 2009                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft      Unauthenticated Emergency Service          July 2008


      required by Section 6.1.5.
   o  The ESRP receives the INVITE and processes it according to the
      description in Section 6.3.3.  The location of the end host may
      need to be determined using a protocol interaction shown in (4).
   o  Potentially, an interaction between the LCS of the ISP and the LCS
      of the IAP may be necessary, see (5).
   o  Finally, the correct PSAP for the location of the end host has to
      be evaluated, see (6).
   o  The ESRP routes the call to the PSAP, as shown in (7).
   o  The PSAP evaluates the initial INVITE and aims to complete the
      call setup.
   o  Finally, when the call setup is completed media traffic can be
      exchanged between the PSAP and the emergency caller.

   For editorial reasons the end-to-end SIP and media exchange between
   the PSAP and SIP UA are not shown in Figure 1.

   Two important aspects are worth to highlight:

   o  The IAP/ISP needs to understand the concept of emergency calls and
      the SIP profile described in this document.  No other VoIP
      protocol profile, such as XMPP, Skype, etc., are supported for
      emergency calls in this particular architecture.  Other profiles
      may be added in the future, but the deployment effort is enormous
      since they have to be universally deployed.
   o  The end host has no obligation to determine location information.
      It may attach location information if it has location available
      (e.g., from a GPS receiver).

   Figure 1 shows that the ISP needs to deploy SIP-based emergency
   services functionality.  It is important to note that the ISP itself
   may outsource the functionality by simply providing access to them
   (e.g., it puts the IP address of an ESRP or a LoST server into an
   allow-list).  For editorial reasons this outsourcing is not shown.

   It is important to note that a single ESRP may also offer it's
   service to several ISPs.


6.  Profiles

6.1.  End Host Profile

6.1.1.  LoST Server Discovery

   The end host MAY attempt to use [I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost] to discover a
   LoST server.  If that attempt fails, the end host SHOULD attempt to
   discover the address of an ESRP.

6.1.2.  ESRP Discovery

   The end host only needs an ESRP when location configuration or LoST
   server discovery fails.  If that is the case, then the end host MUST
   use the "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP-for-IPv4) Option
   for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Servers" [RFC3361] (for IPv6)
   and / or the "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv6) Options
   for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Servers" [RFC3319] to discover
   the address of an ESRP.  This SIP proxy located in the ISP network
   will be used as the ESRP for routing emergency calls.  There is no
   need to discovery a separate SIP proxy with specific emergency call
   functionality since the internal procedure for emergency call
   processing is subject of ISP internal operation.

6.1.3.  Location Determination and Location Configuration

   The end host SHOULD attempt to use the supported LCPs to configure
   its location.  If no LCP is supported in the end host or the location
   configuration is not successful, then the end host MUST attempt to
   discover an ESRP, which would assist the end host in providing the
   location to the PSAP.

   The SIP UA in the end host SHOULD attach the location information in
   a PIDF-LO [RFC4119] when making an emergency call.  When constructing
   the PIDF-LO the guidelines in PIDF-LO profile
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-pdif-lo-profile] MUST be followed.  For civic
   location information the format defined in [RFC5139] MUST be
   supported.

6.1.4.  Emergency Call Identification

   To determine which calls are emergency calls, some entity needs to
   map a user entered dialstring into this URN scheme.  A user may
   "dial" 1-1-2, but the call would be sent to urn:service:sos.  This



Schulzrinne, et al.     Expires January 13, 2009               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft      Unauthenticated Emergency Service          July 2008


   mapping SHOULD be performed at the endpoint device.

   End hosts MUST use the Service URN mechanism [RFC5031] to mark calls
   as emergency calls for their home emergency dial string (if known).
   For visited emergency dial string the translation into the Service
   URN mechanism is not mandatory since the ESRP in the ISPs network
   knows the visited emergency dial strings.

6.1.5.  SIP Emergency Call Signaling

   SIP signaling capabilities [RFC3261] are mandated for end hosts.

   The initial SIP signaling method is an INVITE.  The SIP INVITE
   request MUST be constructed according to the requirements in Section
   9.2 [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp].

   Regarding callback behavior SIP UAs MUST have a globally routable URI
   in a Contact: header.

6.1.6.  Media

   End points MUST comply with the media requirements for end points
   placing an emergency call found in Section 14 of
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp].

6.1.7.  Testing

   The description in Section 15 of [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp] is fully
   applicable to this document.

6.2.  IAP/ISP Profile

6.2.1.  ESRP Discovery

   An ISP hosting an ESRP MUST implement the server side part of
   "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP-for-IPv4) Option for
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Servers" [RFC3361] (for IPv4) and /
   or the "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv6) Options for
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Servers" [RFC3319].

6.2.2.  Location Determination and Location Configuration

   The ISP not hosting an ESRP MUST support at least one widely used
   LCP.  The ISP hosting an ESRP MUST perform the neccesary steps to
   determine the location of the end host.  It is not necessary to
   standardize a specific mechanism.

   The role of the ISP is to operate the LIS.  The usage of HELD

Internet-Draft      Unauthenticated Emergency Service          July 2008


   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery] with the identity
   extensions [I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-identity-extensions] may be
   a possible choice.  It might be necessary for the ISP to talk to the
   IAP in order to determine the location of the end host.  The work on
   LIS-to-LIS communication may be relevant, see
   [I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-lis2lis-req].

6.3.  ESRP Profile

6.3.1.  Emergency Call Routing

   The ESRP must route the emergency call to the PSAP responsible for
   the physical location of the end host.  However, a standardized
   approach for determining the correct PSAP based on a given location
   is useful but not mandatory.

   For cases where a standardized protocol is used LoST
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost] is a suitable mechanism.

6.3.2.  Emergency Call Identification

   The ESRP MUST understand the Service URN mechanism [RFC5031] (i.e.,
   the 'urn:service:sos' tree) and additionally the national emergency
   dial strings.  The ESRP SHOULD perform a mapping of national
   emergency dial strings to Service URNs to simplify processing at
   PSAPs.

6.3.3.  SIP Emergency Call Signaling

   SIP signaling capabilities [RFC3261] are mandated for the ESRP.  The
   ESRP MUST process the messages sent by the client, according to
   Section 6.1.5.  Furthermore, the ESRP MUST be able to add a reference
   to location information, as described in SIP Location Conveyance
   [I-D.ietf-sip-location-conveyance], before forwarding the call to the
   PSAP.  The ISP MUST be prepared to receive incoming dereferencing
   requests to resolve the reference to the location information.

6.3.4.  Location Retrieval

   The ESRP acts a location recipient and the usage of HELD
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery] with the identity
   extensions [I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-identity-extensions] may be
   a possible choice.  The ESRP would thereby act as a HELD client and
   the corresponding LIS at the ISP as the HELD server.

   The ESRP needs to obtain enough information to route the call.  The
   ESRP itself, however, does not necessarily need to process location
   information obtained via HELD since it may be used as input to LoST

   to obtain the PSAP URI.


7.  Security Considerations

   The security threats discussed in [RFC5069] are applicable to this
   document.  A number of security vulnerabilities discussed in
   [I-D.barnes-geopriv-lo-sec] around faked location information are
   less problematic in this case since location information does not
   need to be provided by the end host itself or it can be verified to
   fall within a specific geographical area.

   There are a couple of new vulnerabilities raised with unauthenticated
   emergency services since the PSAP operator does is not in possession
   of any identity information about the emergency call via the
   signaling path itself.  In countries where this functionality is used
   for GSM networks today this has lead to a significant amount of
   misuse.

   The link layer mechanisms need to provide a special way of handling
   unauthenticated emergency services.  Although this subject is not a
   topic for the IETF itself but there are at least a few high-level
   assumptions that may need to be collected.  This includes security
   features that may be desirable.
