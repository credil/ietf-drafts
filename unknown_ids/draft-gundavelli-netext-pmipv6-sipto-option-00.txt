        IP Traffic Offload Selector Option for Proxy Mobile IPv6
           draft-gundavelli-netext-pmipv6-sipto-option-00.txt

Abstract

   This specification defines a mechanism and a related mobility option
   for carrying IP Offload traffic selectors between a mobile access
   gateway and a local mobility anchor in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.
   Based on the received offload flow selectors from the local mobility
   anchor, a mobile access gateway can enable offload traffic rule on
   the selected IP flows.

Internet-Draft     IP Traffic Offload Selector Option          July 2011


1.  Introduction

   Mobile Operators are expanding their network coverage by integrating
   various access technology domains into a common IP mobile core.  For
   providing IP mobility support to mobile nodes irrespective of the
   access network domain to which they are attached to, the protocol
   interfaces such as based on 3GPP S2/a Proxy Mobile IPv6 [TS23402]
   specified by the 3GPP system architecture provides the needed
   protocol glue.  When this protocol interface based on Proxy Mobile
   IPv6 [RFC5213] is used, the mobile node is topologically anchored on
   the local mobility anchor [RFC5213] in the home network.  The mobile
   node's IP traffic is always tunneled back from the mobile access
   gateway [RFC5213] in the access network to the local mobility anchor
   in the home network.

   However, with the exponential growth in the mobile data traffic,
   mobile operators are exploring new ways to offload some of the IP
   traffic flows at the nearest access edge where ever there is an
   internet peering point, as supposed to carrying it all the way to the
   mobility anchor in the home network.  Not all IP traffic needs to be
   routed back to the home network, some of the non-essential traffic
   which does not require IP mobility support can be offloaded at the
   mobile access gateway in the access network.  This approach provides
   greater leverage and efficient usage of the mobile packet core with
   increased overall network capacity and by lowering transport costs.
   The local mobility anchor in the home network can potentially deliver
   the IP flow selectors to the mobile access gateway in the access
   network, for identifying the IP flows that needs to be offloaded.

   This document defines a new mobility option, IP Traffic Offload
   Selector option for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).  This option can be
   used by the local mobility anchor for notifying the flow selectors
   for that can be used by the local mobility anchor for notifying the
   mobile access gateway flows that can be offloaded at the access edge.
   Since, the mobile node's IP address topologically belongs to the home
   network, the offloaded IP traffic flows need to be NAT [RFC2663]
   translated.  Given this NAT translation requirement for the offloaded
   traffic, this approach will be limited to mobile node's IPv4 flows.
   There are better ways to solve this problem for IPv6 and with the
   goal not to create NAT66 requirement, this specification does not
   support traffic offload support for IPv6 flows.  This document also
   does not define any new semantics for flow selectors.  The flow
   identification and the related semantics are all leveraged from
   [RFC6088].

2.  Conventions and Terminology

2.1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  Terminology

   All the mobility related terms used in this document are to be
   interpreted as defined in the base Proxy Mobile IPv6 specifications
   [RFC5213] and [RFC5844].  Additionally, this document uses the
   following abbreviations:

   IP Flow

      IP Flow represents a set of IP packets that match a traffic
      selector.  The selector is typically based on the source IP
      address, destination IP address, source port, destination port and
      other fields in upper layer headers.

   Selective IP Traffic Offload (SIPTO)

      Ability to select specific IP flows and route them to the local
      network, as supposed to tunneling them to the home network.

   NAT (Network Address Translation)

      Network Address Translation [RFC2663] is a method by which IP
      addresses are mapped from one address realm to another, providing
      transparent routing to end hosts.


3.  Solution Overview

   The following illustrates the scenario where the mobile access
   gateway in an access network having the ability to offload some of
   the IPv4 traffic flows, based on the traffic selectors it received
   from the local mobility anchor in the home network.

3.1.  LMA Considerations

   The following considerations apply to the local mobility anchor and
   the mobile access gateway.

   Figure 1 explains the operational sequence of the IP Traffic Offload
   selectors between the mobile access gateway and the local mobility
   anchor.

            Figure 2: Exchange of IP Traffic Offload Selectors

   o  If the received Proxy Binding Update includes the IP Traffic
      Offload Selector Option Section 4, but if the local mobility
      anchor either does not have the SIPTO capability, or it chooses to
      deny the SIPTO request, the local mobility anchor MUST ignore the
      IP Traffic Offload Selector Option and this would have no effect
      on the operation of the rest of the protocol.

   o  If the local mobility anchor has the SIPTO capability and chooses
      to deliver the flow policies, the local mobility anchor can
      construct the traffic selectors based on the routing policy and
      deliver those selectors in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement
      message using the IP Traffic Offload Selector Option.

3.2.  MAG Considerations

   o  The mobile access gateway MAY choose to notify the local mobility
      anchor about its SIPTO capability by including the IP Traffic
      Offload Selector Option Section 4 in the Proxy Binding Update
      message.  If the mobile access gateway cannot does not have SIPTO
      capability, this option MUST NOT be included in the Proxy Binding
      Update.

   o  If there is no IP Traffic Offload Selector Option in the
      corresponding Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message, it is
      considered that the local mobility anchor does not support SIPTO
      capability, specifically, it cannot deliver selectors for IP
      traffic offload flows.

   o  If there IP Traffic Offload Selector Option in the corresponding
      Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message, it serves as an hint that
      the local mobility anchor can support SIPTO and the included
      traffic spec MUST be applied by the mobile access gateway.


4.  IP Traffic Offload Selector Option

   A new option, IP Traffic Offload Selector option, is defined for
   using it in Proxy Binding Update (PBU) and Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement (PBA) messages exchanged between a local mobility
   anchor and a mobile access gateway.  This option is used for carrying
   the flow selectors for supporting IP traffic offload function at the
   mobile access gateway.  The option includes the parameters for
   selecting IP flows for offload.

   The alignment requirement for this option is 4n.

   Type
      <IANA>

   Length
      8-bit unsigned integer indicating the length in octets of the
      option, excluding the type and length fields.

   Reserved  This field is unused for now.  The value MUST be
      initialized to 0 by the sender and MUST be ignored by the
      receiver.

   TS Format  An 8-bit unsigned integer indicating the Traffic Selector
      Format.  Value "0" is reserved and MUST NOT be used.  The value of
      (1) is assigned for IPv4 Binary Traffic Selector [RFC6088].

   TS Selector  A variable-length opaque field for including the traffic
      specification identified by the TS format field.  When the value
      of TS Format field is set to (1), the format that follows is the
      IPv4 Binary Traffic Selector specified in section 3.1 of
      [RFC6088].


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the following two IANA actions.

   o  Action-1: This specification defines a new Mobility Header option,
      IP Traffic Offload Selector option.  This option is described in
      Section 4.  The Type value for this option needs to be assigned
      from the same numbering space as allocated for the other mobility
      options [RFC3775].

   o  Action-2: The Sub-type field of the IP Traffic Offload Selector
      option introduces a new number space.  This number space needs to
      be managed by IANA, under the Registry, IP Traffic Offload

      Selector Type Registry.  This specification reserves the sub-type
      value of (1) and (2).  Approval of new sub-type values are to be
      made through IANA Expert Review.


6.  Security Considerations

   The IP Traffic Offload Selector option defined in this specification
   is for use in Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledgement
   messages.  This option is carried like any other mobility header
   option as specified in [RFC5213] and does not require any special
   security considerations.  Carrying IP traffic offload selectors does
   not introduce any new security vulnerabilities.
