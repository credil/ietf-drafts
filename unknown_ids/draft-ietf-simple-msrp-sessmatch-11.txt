 Session Matching Update for the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP)
                draft-ietf-simple-msrp-sessmatch-11.txt

Abstract

   This document defines an extension, sessmatch, for the Message
   Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) session matching procedure of MSRP
   entities.  The extension extends the applicability of MSRP
   communication to network scenarios where Application Layer Gateway
   (ALG) functions modify the Session Description Protocol (SDP) MSRP
   address information.  The document also defines a Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) option-tag, sessmatch, that is used by MSRP entities
   to indicate support of the sessmatch extension.

1.  Introduction

   The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) [RFC4975] is designed to
   use MSRP relays [RFC4976] as a means for Network Address Translation
   (NAT) traversal and policy enforcement.

   However, many Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] networks,
   in which MSRP usage is emerging, also contain SIP Application Layer
   Gateways (ALGs), which anchor and controls media, perform tasks such
   as NAT traversal, performance monitoring, lawful intercept, address
   domain bridging, interconnect Service Layer Agreement (SLA) policy
   enforcement, etc.  An example is the Interconnect Border Control
   Function (IBCF) [3GPP.23.228] defined by the 3rd Generation
   Partnership Project (3GPP), which controls a media relay that handles
   all types of SIP session media (voice, video, MSRP, etc).

   MSRP, as defined in RFC 4975 [RFC4975] and RFC 4976 [RFC4976], does
   not work when an MSRP entities communicate with such ALGs, unless the
   ALGs implement MSRP Back-To-Back User Agent (B2BUA) functionality.
   The reason is that entities use the MSRP URI comparison [RFC4975]
   procedure in order to match an MSRP message to an MSRP session.  That
   requires consistency between the address information in the MSRP
   messages and the address information carried in the SDP a=path
   attribute.  The matching will fail if ALGs modify the address
   information of the SDP a=path attribute, but do not implement MSRP
   B2BUA functionality and perform the corresponding modification in the
   associated MSRP messages.  However, few ALGs implement MSRP B2BUA
   functionality, due to complexity and poor scalability.

   This specification defines an MSRP extension, sessmatch, that allows
   MSRP entities to communicate with ALGs that do not implement MSRP
   B2BUA functionality.  MSRP entities that support the sessmatch
   extension use a different mechanism for matching an MSRP message with
   an MSRP session, called session matching.  Instead of using the MSRP
   URI comparison procedure defined in RFC 4975, only the MSRP
   session-id part is used for the session matching.

   The sessmatch extension is backward compatible.  In the absence of
   ALGs, MSRP entities that do not implement the sessmatch extension can
   interoperate with entities that do implement it.  The reason is that
   the matching of an MSRP message to an ongoing session will not fail.
   MSRP entities that do not implement the sessmatch extension, and
   communicate with ALGs that do not implement MSRP B2BUA functionality,
   can normally not establish MSRP sessions, since the session matching
   will fail in case the address information of the SDP a=path attribute
   has been modified by the ALGs.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   In this specification the terminology "fingerprint based TLS
   authentication" and "name based TLS authentication" are used to refer
   to the two cases where:

   1.  An endpoint use a self-signed TLS certificate and sends a
   certificate fingerprint in SDP (fingerprint based TLS
   authentication).

   2.  An endpoint use a certificate from a well known certificate
   authority and the other endpoint matches the hostname in the received
   TLS communication SubjectAltName parameter towards the hostname
   received in the MSRP URI in SDP (name based TLS authentication).


3.  Applicability statement

   This document defines an MSRP extension, sessmatch.  Support of the
   extension is optional.  MSRP entities can implement the extension in
   order to allow MSRP communication in networks where ALGs that might
   modify the address information of the SDP a=path attribute, but do
   not implement MSRP B2BUA functionality, are present.


4.  Sessmatch mechanism

4.1.  General

   This section defines how an MSRP entity that supports the sessmatch
   extension performs session matching, i.e. matches an incoming MSRP
   message to an MSRP session.

4.2.  Session matching

   The difference between the session matching mechanism in RFC 4975,
   and the one defined in this specification for the sessmatch
   extension, is that while the mechanism in RFC 4975 uses the MSRP URI
   comparison rules for session matching, the sessmatch extension only
   uses the session-id part of the MSRP URI.

   When an MSRP entity that receives the first MSRP request for an MSRP
   session, the To-Path header field of the request should contain a URI

   with a session-id part that was provided in the SDP associated with
   the MSRP session.  The entity that accepted the connection looks up
   the session-id part of the MSRP URI in the received requests, in
   order to determine which session it matches.  The session-id part is
   compared as case sensitive.  If a match exists, the entity MUST
   assume that the host that formed the connection is the host to which
   this URI was given.  If no match exists, the entity MUST reject the
   request with a 481 response.  The entity MUST also check to make sure
   the session is not already in use on another connection.  If the
   session is already in use, it MUST reject the request with a 506
   response.

4.3.  Usage of 'sessmatch' option-tag

   This section describes how an MSRP entity that supports the sessmatch
   extension uses the sessmatch option-tag.

   An MSRP entity that supports the sessmatch extension, and is not
   located behind an MSRP relay, MUST insert the 'sessmatch' option-tag
   in the Supported header field of the initial INVITE request for a
   session that contains MSRP media.  If at least one reliably sent
   successful response to the intial INVITE request contains the
   'sessmatch' option-tag in the Supported header field of the response,
   the MSRP entity MUST use the session matching procedures defined in
   this specification during the session.  Otherwise, if the MSRP entity
   wants the MSRP session to proceed, the MSRP entity MUST use the
   procedures defined in RFC 4975.

   If an MSRP entity that supports the sessmatch extension receives an
   initial INVITE request that contains the 'sessmatch' option-tag in
   the Supported or Require header field of the request, and if it is
   not located behind an MSRP relay, it MUST insert the 'sessmatch'
   option-tag in the Supported header field of at least one reliably
   sent successful response to the intial INVITE request, and it MUST
   use the session matching procedures defined in this specification
   during the session.  Otherwise, if the MSRP entity wants the MSRP
   session to proceed, the MSRP entity MUST NOT insert the 'sessmatch'
   option-tag in a successful response to the initial INVITE request,
   and it MUST use the session matching procedures defined in RFC 4975.

   In addition to inserting the 'sessmatch' option-tag in the Supported
   header field of the INVITE request, if an entity is performing MSRP
   related procedures that require the remote MSRP entity to support the
   sessmatch extension in order to enable MSRP media, it MUST also
   insert the 'sessmatch' option-tag in the Require header field.

   NOTE: An example of a scenarios where an entity needs to insert the
   'sessmatch' option-tag in the Require header field, is when it acts

   as an intermediary entity that modifies the SDP a=path attribute
   address information, in order to anchor and forward MSRP traffic, but
   will not be able to perform the corresponding address information
   changes in the associated MSRP messages.  The actions taken by such
   entity in case the remote MSRP entity does not support the sessmatch
   extension, and therfore sends a 420 (Not Supported) response to the
   INVITE request, is outside the scope of this specification.

4.4.  Uniqueness of the session-id

   The session-id used to perform session matching is retrieved from the
   To-Path header field MSRP URI of a received MSRP message.  The
   session-id has been generated by the receiving MSRP entity itself.
   The MSRP entity MUST ensure that the session-id is unique among the
   other session-ids generated by that MSRP entity.


5.  ALG assumptions

5.1.  General

   This document does not specify ALG behavior.  However, as the main
   reason behind the sessmatch extension is to allow MSRP entities to
   communicate in networks where ALGs are present, this document makes
   certain assumptions regarding to how such ALGs behave.

5.2.  MSRP awareness

   This document assumes that an ALG is MSRP aware, meaning that it
   modifies the address information in the SDP a=path attribute in order
   to anchor the MSRP communication, but that the ALG does not perform
   the associated modification in the To-Path and From-Path header
   fields of MSRP messages.

   NOTE: Other types of media traffic are normally routed using the SDP
   c/m-lines, which an ALG can modify in order to anchor such media
   communication.

5.3.  TCP connection reuse

   When the sessmatch extension is used, ALGs are not required to parse
   and modify the MSRP payload.  An ALG that does not parse the MSRP
   payload might not enable re-usage of TCP connections for multiple
   MSRP sessions.  Instead, in order to associate an MSRP message with a
   specific session, the ALG often assigns a unique local address:port
   combination for each MSRP session.

5.4.  SDP integrity

   This document assumes that an ALG, in order to anchor the MSRP
   communication, modifies the address and port information in the SDP
   a=path attribute, and therefor can not be deployed in environments
   that require SIP identity based peer-to-peer SDP protection.

5.5.  TLS

   This document considers two approaches how an ALG handles TLS
   protected MSRP connections.

   In the first approach, the ALG relays the MSRP media packages at the
   transport layer.  The TLS handshake and resulting security
   association (SA) are established peer-to-peer between the MSRP
   endpoints.  The ALG will see encrypted MSRP media pacakges, but is
   unable to inspect the cleartext content.

   In the second approach, the ALG acts as a TLS B2BUA, meaning that
   separate SAs are established between the ALG and each MSRP endpoint.
   The ALG decrypts MSRP media packages received from one MSRP endpoint,
   and then re-encrypts them before sending them toward the other MSRP
   endpoint.  With this approach, the ALG can inspect and modify the
   cleartext content.


6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  MSRP URI as shared secret

   An MSRP entity that does not support the sessmatch extension uses the
   complete MSRP URI (scheme, authority, transport, session-id) as a
   shared secret in order to determine that an incoming transport
   connection originates from the intended endpoint device.  The shared
   secret needs to be hard to guess, but in reality only the session-id
   part with it's minimum 80 bit of randomness is hard to guess.  Using
   only the MSRP URI session-id part as shared secret is therefore
   roughly as good as using the complete URI.

6.2.  Man in the middle

   The sessmatch extension makes it easier for a man in the middle
   (MiTM) to transparently insert itself in the communication between
   MSRP endpoints in order to monitor or record unproteted MSRP
   communication.  It does not however enable a MiTM to monitor TLS
   protected MSRP or to in any significant way modify the MSRP
   communication content.  That would require the MiTM to terminate the
   TCP/MSRP or TCP/TLS/MSRP connection in both directions, eventhough it

Internet-Draft                    MRSP                          May 2011


   would not need to allign the address information in the TCP/IP header
   of the media packets with the modification in the associated SDP
   a=path attribute.

6.3.  TLS

   If an ALG relays TLS connections, MSRP endpoints will not be able to
   use name based authentication nor fingerprint based authentication
   for TLS.

   With name based authentication the problem is that each MSRP endpoint
   would present a certificate associated to its the hostname, which
   would match the authority part of the MSRP URI inserted in the SDP
   a=path attribute of the offer or answer.  However, when the ALG
   modifies the MSRP URI in the SDP a=path attribute, the resulting
   authority part will no long match, and the TLS handshake will fail.

   With fingerprint based authentication the problem is instead that the
   "SIP Identity" based integrity protection of SDP will break.

   If an ALG acts as a TLS B2BUA, MSRP endpoints will be able to use
   both name based and fingerprint based authentication for TLS, as the
   ALG acts as a TLS endpoint.  As the ALG acts as a TLS endpoints, MSRP
   endpoint might be given an incorrect impression that there is an end-
   to-end SA between the MSRP endpoints.

   Considering the issues above, in order for MSRP endpoints to be able
   to authenticate TLS in a secure manner in a network where ALGs are
   present, an MSRP endpoint supporting the sessmatch extension SHOULD,
   in addition to the authentication mechanisms described in RFC 4975,
   support an authentication mechanism that does not rely on the a=path
   attribute value being transported unchanged peer-to-peer.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that an MSRP endpoint supporting the sessmatch extension
   supports one of the following authentication mechanisms:

   1) TLS certificates together with support of interacting with a
   Certificate Management Service [ref to draft-ietf-sip-certs], to
   which it publishes the public version of its own self-signed
   certificate and from which it fetches on need the public certificates
   of other endpoints; or

   2) TLS-PSK managed e.g by MIKEY-TICKET based Key Management and Key
   Management Service [RFC6043].

   An MSRP endpoint that supports the sessmatch extension and one of the
   mechanisms above SHALL, when it creates an SDP offer for MSRPS, in
   addition to including the SDP attributes associated with the TLS
   authentication mechanisms described in RFC 4975, include the SDP

Internet-Draft                    MRSP                          May 2011


   attributes associated with the supported authentication mechanism
   above.  If both MSRP endpoints support the same authentication
   mechanism based on pre-shared secrets, that mechanism SHALL be used,
   rather than a mechanism defined in RFC 4975.

   NOTE: 3GPP has specified usage of the MIKEY-TICKET based Key
   Management and Key Management Service authentication mechanism for
   the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS).

   If MSRP endpoints supporting sessmatch do not support a common TLS
   authentication based on a pre-shared secret, and neither MSRP
   endpoint is located behind an MSRP relay, they SHALL either (based on
   local policy or configuration):

   1) Use a TLS authenctication mechanism defined in RFC 4975, which
   will succeed if there are no ALGs in the MSRP path; or

   2) When support of the sessmatch extension is indicated in a request
   or response received from the other MSRP endpoint, use fingerprint
   based authentication without performing SIP Identity based integrity
   check, and thus trust the network entities in the signaling path.

   NOTE: The second alternative is needed, in networks where ALGs are
   present, if the user whishes to establish a TLS based communication
   even if one of the MSRP endpoint, or the network, does not support a
   common TLS authentication mechanism based on a pre-shared secret.  As
   defined in RFC 4975, if TLS autentication fails, users need to be
   able to decide whether to try to establish an MSRP connection without
   TLS protection.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This section registers a new SIP option-tag, according to the
   procedures of RFC 3261.

7.1.  IANA Registration of the sessmatch Option Tag

   This section registers a new SIP option tag, sessmatch.  The required
   information for this registration, as specified in RFC 3261, is:

    Name: sessmatch

    Description: This option tag is for indicating support of the MSRP session
                matching mechanism defined in RFC XXXX. When present in a Supported header
                field, it indicates that the sending UA supports the session matching
                mechanism. When present in a Require header field of a request, it indicates
                that the reciving UA MUST support the session matching mechanism.
