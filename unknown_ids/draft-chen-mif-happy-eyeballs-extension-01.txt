               draft-chen-mif-happy-eyeballs-extension-01

Abstract

   The memo has been proposed to extend happy eyeballs algorithm to fit
   into multiple interfaces environment.  Based on this extended
   heuristic algorithm, a client with multiple interface could determine
   the optimal flow path in which specific interface has been chosen.

   be also identified to guarantee user experiences during IPv6
   transition period.

1.  Introduction

   In multiple interface context, the problems raised by hosts with
   multiple interfaces have been discussed.  The MIF problem
   statement[MIF-PS] has described the various issues when using a MIF
   node on which multiple interfaces are used and results in wrong
   domain selection.  Happy Eyeballs [HAPPY-EYEBALLS] has described how
   a dual-stack client can determine the functioning path to a dual-
   stack server.  It's using heuristic algorithm help applications to
   quickly determine if IPv6 or IPv4 is the most optimal to connect to a
   server.  That is a good method to achieve intelligent path selection.
   However, the assumption here is single-homed host.  The interaction
   with multiple interfaces is still waiting for further study.

   This memo has been proposed to extend happy eyeballs algorithm to fit
   into multiple interfaces environment.  That could achieve win-win
   situation.  Based on this extended heuristic algorithm, a client with
   multiple interface could determine the optimal flow path in which
   specific interface has been chosen.  Furthermore, an appropriate IP
   address family for each interface can be also identified to guarantee
   user experiences during IPv6 transition period.


2.  Heuristic Happy Eyeballs Extension Algorithm

   The section details extended Happy Eyeballs algorithm, including new
   defined data structure, functionalities and example flow.

   Each interface will be configured with weighting coefficient, which
   is composed of pair values.  Apart from value P, which is following
   current definition in [HAPPY-EYEBALLS], value I is defined to
   indicate preference of interfaces selection.  In general, value I is
   responsible for interface selection; value P is a indication to
   identify IPv4 or IPv6 family has been preferred.

2.2.  Algorithm for Interface Selection

   According to the definition, applications will take account of value
   I to identify which interface has been chosen before sending out data
   packages .

   Each interface is configured with one value, I. I is served as an
   indication to identify which interface is preferred for a specific
   destination or hostname.  A positive value indicates preference of
   specific interface compared to others.  The value is justified
   according to TCP establishment duration.  The detailed flow can be
   found in 2.4.  The selection of a particular interface from the
   viable set implies a selection of one particular network path in
   preference to other viable paths.  The rule here is that the shorter
   path is the winner.  When one interface defeats others, the
   corresponding value I will be set to positive value.  Other
   interfaces will be set negative value orderly according to caused
   time for TCP connection, like -1, -2, etc.  A value of 0 indicates
   equal weight for multiple interfaces.  In this case, the heuristic
   connection is not valid for interface selection.

   After several interface values I have been configured, the traffic
   flow targeted to specific destination address or hostname will follow
   this guidance to choose proper interface.  When connection problems
   are occurred to preferred connection, the value I need to be
   adjusted.  The adjustment of value I will do polling-based scheme.
   the value I corresponding to suboptimal interface will be configured
   as positive.  And previously optimal value I will be set to most-
   negative.

2.3.  IPv4/IPv6 Selection Algorithm for Individual Interface

   For a specific interface in a dual-stack single interface node, the
   choice of IP address family relies on Happy Eyeballs algorithm, which
   is defined in [HAPPY-EYEBALLS].

2.4.  Example of Extended Algorithm

   The Figure 2 shows example flow for algorithm implemetation,in which
   a host with three interfaces is demonstrated.  It's easy to apply
   that to more interfaces situation.

   Figure 2: Example of Algorithm Execution

   The example above shows the algorithm execution with emphasis on the
   computation of coefficient value I. The value P will be calculated as
   defined in [HAPPY-EYEBALLS].

   When the client initiates an application session, multiple interfaces
   will perform a DNS query simultaneously.  As a result, DNS server
   will return IP address related to requested FQDN, as shown from step
   1 to 6.  Afterwards, three interfaces are trying to establish TCP
   connection with remote peer IP address synchronously as shown from
   step 7 to 15.  In this example, interface 1 competes with another two
   and firstly finish TCP connection.  So value I will be set to 1.  And
   second one is set to -1; the last one is set to -2.  The interface 2
   and 3 will then send RST to remote IP peer for release TCP sessions.

   IP defined in the diagram is the addresses resulting from the DNS
   query.  In the case of both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses returned from the
   DNS query for the destination host, the algorithm defined in
   [HAPPY-EYEBALLS] is used.  As described earlier which ever interface
   results in the fastest TCP connection setup wins and the IP address
   type that was used for connection setup is the one that will be
   selected.

   At the end of the whole process, interface 1 will be set to most-
   preferred interface for a specific this particular destination or
   hostname. if there is an accidental connection problem has occurred,

   the value I with interface 1 will be set to -2.  And the values I
   related to interface 2 and 3 will increase sequentially to be set to
   1 and -1.  Subsequent traffic will take interface 2 as preferred
   interface for traffic delivery.  By providing the IPv6


3.  Additional Considerations

3.1.  Usage Scope

   Happy Eyeballs is trageting to HTTP context, but it is useful and
   applicable to other time-sensitive applications.

3.2.  Flow Continuity

   Usually, interface changing happens at the beginning of new session.
   So, there is no flow continuity issues for ongoing TCP sesson.
   Dynamic movement of traffic flows are addressed by other IETF
   protocols as well.

3.3.  Default Address Selection

   If more than one IPv6 address is assigned to the interface, the
   native IPv6 address is given preference.

3.4.  DNS server Selection

   The extended Eyeballs algortihm for described herein is independent
   of DNS server selection routings implemented on the multi-interface
   client.  The DNS queries will be triggered to those DNS servers per
   policy and methods of the MIF client and the extended MIF enabled
   Eyeballs extensions work regardless.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


5.  Security Considerations
