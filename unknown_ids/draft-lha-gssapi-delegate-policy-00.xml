	Several GSS-API applications work in a multi-tiered
	architecture, where the server takes advantage of delegated
	user credentials to act on behalf of the user and contact
	additional servers.  In effect, the server acts as an agent on
	behalf of the user.  Examples include web applications that
	need to access e-mail or file servers as well as CIFs file
	servers.  However, delegating the ability to act as a user to
	a party who is not sufficiently trusted is problematic from a
	security standpoint.  Kerberos provides a flag called
	OK-AS-DELEGATE that allows the administrator of a Kerberos
	realm to communicate that a particular service is trusted for
	delegation.  This specification adds support for this flag and
	similar facilities in other authentication mechanisms to
	GSS-API (RFC 2743).

      <t>

	Several GSS-API applications work in a multi-tiered
	architecture, where the server takes advantage of delegated
	user credentials to act on behalf of the user and contact
	additional servers.  In effect, the server acts as an agent on
	behalf of the user.  Examples include web applications that
	need to access e-mail or file servers as well as CIFs file
	servers.  However, delegating the ability to act as a user to
	a party who is not sufficiently trusted is problematic from a
	security standpoint.

      </t>
      <t>

	Today, GSS-API <xref target="RFC2743" /> leaves the
	determination of whether delegation is desired to the client
	application.  If the client sets the deleg_req_flag to
	gss_init_sec_context then the application requests
	delegation. This requires client applications to know what
	services should be trusted for delegation.  In some cases,
	however, a central authority is in a better position to know
	what services should receive delegation than the client
	application.  Some mechanisms such as Kerberos
	<xref target="RFC4121" /> have a facility to allow a realm
	administrator to communicate that a particular service is a
	valid target for delegation.  In Kerberos, the KDC can set the
	OK-AS-DELEGATE flag in issued tickets.  However even in such a
	case, delegating to services for applications that do not need
	delegation is problematic.  So, it is desirable for a GSS-API
	client to be able to request delegation if and only-if central
	policy reccomends delegation to the given target.

      </t>
      <t>

	This specification adds a new input flag to
	GSS_Init_sec_context to request delegation when approved by
	central policy.  In addition, a constant value to be used in
	the GSS-API C bindings <xref target="RFC2744" /> is defined.
	Finally, the behavior for the Kerberos mechanism
	<xref target="RFC4121" /> is specified.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="GSS-API flag, c binding">
      <t>
	The GSS_Init_sec_context API is extended to gain a new input
	flag: if the deleg_policy_req flag is set, then delegation
	should be performed if recommended by central policy.  In
	addition, the C bindings are extended to define the following
	constant to represent this new flag.</t>

    <section title="GSS-API behavior">
      <t>
	
	As before, if the GSS_C_DELEG_FLAG is set, the GSS-API
	mechanism tries to delegate. Output ret_flags contains the
	flag GSS_C_DELEG_FLAG if delegation is successful.
	
      </t>
      <t>

	If the GSS_C_DELEG_POLICY_FLAG is set, the code delegates only
	if the mechanism policy allows delegation. If delegation is
	done, the output flag ret_flags contain both GSS_C_DELEG_FLAG
	and GSS_C_DELEG_POLICY_FLAG on the initator and GSS_C_DELEG_FLAG
	on the acceptor.


      </t>
      <t>

	If both GSS_C_DELEG_FLAG and GSS_C_DELEG_POLICY_FLAG are set,
	then delegation is attempted.  However GSS_C_DELEG_POLICY_FLAG
	is only set in ret_flags on the initiator if
	GSS_C_DELEG_POLICY_FLAG would have been sufficient to request
	delegation.

      </t>
    </section>
    
    <section title="GSS-API behavior">
      <t>

	If the GSS_C_DELEG_POLICY_FLAG is set, the Kerberos GSS-API
	mechanism  will only delegate if ok-as-delegate is set
	<xref target="RFC4120"/> in the service ticket.  Other policy checks MAY be applied.

      <t>
	Introduce a flag what allows client to get help from the KDC
	when to delegate to servers, will limit what servers that
	client delegate too.
