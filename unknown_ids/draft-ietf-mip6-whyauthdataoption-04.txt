Abstract

   Mobile IPv6 defines a set of messages that enable the mobile node
   (MN) to authenticate and perform registration with its home agent
   (HA).  These authentication signaling messages between the mobile
   node and home agent are secured by an IPsec SA that is established
   between the MN and HA.  The MIP6 working group has proposed a
   mechanism to secure the binding update and binding acknowledgement
   messages using an authentication option, similar to the

   authentication option in Mobile IPv4, carried within the messages
   that are exchanged between the MN and HA to establish a binding.
   This document provides the justifications as to why the
   authentication option mechanism is needed for Mobile IPv6 deployment
   in certain deployment environments.

2.  Introduction

   Mobile IPv6 relies on the IPsec Security Association between the
   Mobile Node (MN) and the Home Agent (HA) for authentication of the MN
   to its HA before a binding cache can be created at the HA.  An
   alternate mechanism that does not rely on the existence of the IPsec
   SA between the MN and HA for authenticating the MN is needed in
   certain deployment environments.  This document outlines some of the
   reasons why such a mechanism is essential to ensure the applicability
   of MIP6 as a protocol for wider deployment.  It should be noted that
   the alternate solution does not imply that the IPsec based solution
   would be deprecated.  It simply means that in certain deployment
   scenarios there is a need for supporting MIP6 without an IPsec SA
   between the MN and HA.  So the alternate solution would be in
   addition to the IPsec based mechanism specified in the base RFCs, RFC
   3775 [RFC3775] and RFC 3776 [RFC3776].  It should be noted that some
   of the challenges of deploying MIP6 in certain types of networks
   arise from the dependence on IKE which does not integrate will with a
   AAA backend infrastructure.  IKEv2 does address this problem.
   However at the time of discussion on the need for the authentication
   protocol, the specification for using Mobile IPv6 Operation with
   IKEv2 and the revised IPsec Architecture [RFC4877] was still work in
   progress and as a result an alternative solution needed.  This
   document is intended to capture for archival purposes the reasoning
   behind the need for the authentication protocol.


3.  Background

   Mobile IPv6 signaling involves several messages.  These include:

   o  The binding update/Binding ACK between the mobile node and the
      home agent.
   o  The route optimization signaling messages which include HoTI/Hot,
      CoTI/CoT and BU/BAck between the MN and CN.  HoTI and HoT
      signaling messages are routed through the MNs HA.
   o  Mobile prefix solicitation and advertisements between the MN and
      HA.
   o  Home agent discovery by MNs.

   The signaling messages between the MN and HA are secured using the

   IPsec SA that is established between these entities.  The exception
   to this are the messages involved in the home agent discovery
   process.


4.  Applicability Statement

   The authentication option specified in the Authentication Protocol
   for MIP6 [RFC4285] is applicable in certain types of networks that
   have the following characteristics:

   1.  Networks in which the access authentication is separate from the
       authentication of the mobile node to the home agent.  There
       exists a security association between the mobile node and some
       backend authentication server (eg.  AAA Home server) which is
       used for access authentication.
   2.  Networks in which the establishment of the security association
       between the mobile node and the authentication server (AAA Home)
       is established using an out-of-band mechanism and not by any key
       exchange protocol.  Such networks will also rely on out-of-band
       mechanisms to renew the security association (between MN and AAA
       Home) when needed.
   3.  Networks in which the home agent and home address needs to be
       assigned on a dynamic basis.
   4.  Networks which are bandwidth constrained (such as cellular
       wireless networks) and there exists a need to minimize the number
       of signaling messages sent over such interfaces.

   One such example of networks that have such characteristics are cdma
   networks as defined in the 3GPP2 X.S0011-D [3GPP2 X.S0011-D]
   specification.


5.  Justification for the use of the authentication option

   The following two sections provide the reasoning for standardizing
   the authentication option based registration process for Mobile IPv6.
   Section 5.1 provides the key arguments for the use of authentication
   option.  Section 5.2 provides further explanation and additional
   motivations for the authentication option.

5.1.  Motivation for use of authentication option in cdma2000 wireless
      networks

   cdma2000 networks deployed and operational today use Mobile IPv4 for
   IP mobility.  Operators have gained a significant amount of
   operational experience in the process of deploying and operating
   these networks. 3GPP2 is now in the process of specifying Mobile IPv6

   in Revision D of the 3GPP2 X.S0011-D [3GPP2 X.S0011-D] specification
   (which specifies the packet data architecture).  The following are
   the deployment constraints that existing CDMA networks have to deal
   with when deploying Mobility service based on IPv6:

   o  Operators intend to leverage the Mobile IPv4 deployment and
      operational experience by ensuring that Mobile IPv6 has a similar
      deployment and operating model.
   o  Operators will have two parallel networks, one that offers IPv4
      mobility with MIP4 and another providing IPv6 mobility using MIP6.
   o  The same backend subscriber profile database, security keys etc.
      are intended to be used for both Mobile IPv4 and, Mobile IPv6
      service.
   o  The same user configuration information, i.e the identity and keys
      associated with a user will be used for IP mobility service in
      IPv4 and/or IPv6 networks.  The only security association that is
      preconfigured is a shared secret between the mobile node and the
      home-AAA server.  This is in contrast with the currently specified
      Mobile IPv6 model which requires an IPsec SA between the MN and
      HA.  It can be argued that IKEv2 does provide the capability to be
      integrated with a AAA backend.  However IKEv2 is not an option
      that can be considered because of the deployment timelines of
      operators relying on 3GPP2 standards.
   o  The current Mobile IPv6 specification does not support the dynamic
      assignment of home agent and home address.  Although there is on-
      going work in the MIP6 WG to address this, the work is not yet
      ready.  The mechanism defined in Authentication protocol for
      Mobile IPv6 [RFC4285] is capable of handling authentication even
      in the case of dynamic assignments (and is similar to what is used
      in current MIPv4 deployments).
   o  The identity of a user in MIP4-based cdma2000 networks is an MN
      Identifier Option for MIP6 [RFC4283].  Mobile IPv6 as per RFC3775
      specifies the IPv6 home address as the identity of the mobile
      node.  Morever, the home address cannot be dynamically assigned in
      such cases.

   Consequently, MIP6 as specified today does not satisfy necessary
   requirements.  The Authentication protocol for MIP6 [RFC4285] along
   with the MN Identifier option for MIP6 [RFC4283] are enabling the
   deployment of Mobile IPv6 in a manner that is similar to what is
   deployed in cdma2000 networks today.  This authentication model is
   very similar to the one adopted by the MIPv4 WG.  This is explained
   in detail in the 3GPP2 X.S0011-D [3GPP2 X.S0011-D] specification.

   Hence, with the current MIP6 specifications and architecture that
   relies on IPsec as the sole means for securing the signaling between
   the MN and HA, it is not possible to accomplish a deployment that
   mirrors that of MIP4 for cdma deployments.

5.2.  Additional arguments for the use of Authentication option

   The use of IPsec for performing Registration with a home agent is not
   always an optimal solution.  While it is true that IPsec is an
   integral part of the IPv6 stack, it is still a considerable overhead
   from a deployment perspective of using IPsec as the security
   mechanism for the signaling messages between the MN and HA.  This
   statement is a result of experience gained from deployment of Mobile
   IPv4.  MIP4 does not rely on IPsec for securing the Registration
   signaling messages.

   Deployment of Mobile IPv6 on a large scale is possible only when the
   protocol is flexible for being adapted to various scenarios.  The
   scenario being considered is the deployment in cdma2000 net- works.
   cdma2000 networks are currently deployed in many countries today.
   The packet data network architecture of cdma2000 [3GPP2 X.S0011-D]
   includes a MIP4 foreign agent/Home agent and a Radius based AAA
   infrastrucutre for authentication, authorization and accounting
   purposes.  The AAA infrastructure provides the authentication
   capability in the case of Mobile IPv4.

   Typically, the Mobile Node shares a security association with the
   AAA-Home entity.  This is the preferred mode of operation over having
   a shared secret between the MN and HA because the AAA-Home entity
   provides a central location for provisioning and administering the
   shared secrets for a large number of mobiles (millions).  This mode
   of operation also makes dynamic home address and dynamic home agent
   assignment easier.  A similar approach is needed for the deployment
   of Mobile IPv6 in these networks.  There is no practical mechanism to
   use IPsec directly with the AAA infrastructure with out the use of
   IKE or some other mechanism that enables the establishment of the
   IPsec SA between the MN and HA.

   Mobile IPv6 as specified in RFC3775 and RFC3776 implies a very
   specific model for deployment.  It anticipates the Mobile nodes
   having a static home IPv6 address and a designated home agent.  An
   IPsec SA is expected to be created, either via manual keying or
   established dynamically by using IKE.  These assumptions do not
   necessarily fit in very well for the deployment model envisioned in
   cdma2000 networks.

   cdma2000 networks would prefer to allocate home addresses to MNs on a
   dynamic basis.  The advantage of doing so is the fact that the HA can
   be assigned on a link that is close to the MNs point of attachment.
   While route-optimization negates the benefit of having a home-agent
   on a link close to the MN, it cannot be always guaranteed that the MN
   and CN will use or support route optimization.  There may also be
   instances where the operator prefers to not allow route optimization

   for various reasons such as accounting aggregation or enforcing
   service contracts.  In such cases an HA that is close to the MNs
   point of attachment reduces the issues of latency etc. of forward and
   reverse tunnelling of packets between the MN and HA.

   cdma2000 networks that are operational today have large numbers of
   subscribers who are authenticated via the AAA infrastrucure.
   Deployment of Mobile IPv6 should leverage the existing AAA
   infrastructure.  The security model needed in these networks is an SA
   between the MN and AAA-Home entity.  This is the primary security
   association that should be used for authenticating and authorizing
   users to utilize MIPv6 service.  This SA is then used for
   establishing session keys between the MN and the dynamically assigned
   HA for authenticating subsequent binding updates and binding
   acknowledgements between them.  Establishing an IPsec SA between the
   MN and HA using AAA infrastrucure is not specified for Mobile IPv6
   today.  RFC3776 explains how IKE is used for establishing the SA
   between the MN and HA.  And even in this case, the MN has a
   designated home address. cdma2000 network operators would prefer to
   assign home addresses to the MN on a dynamic basis and do this
   preferably using the AAA infrastrucutre which contains subscriber
   profile and capability information.

   A large subset of MNs in cdma2000 networks do not have IKE
   capability.  As a result the use of RFC3776 for setting up the MN-HA
   IPsec SA is not an option.  It should also be noted that IKE requires
   several transactions before it is able to establish the IPsec SA.

   cdma2000 network operators are extremely conscious in terms of the
   number of messages sent and received over the air-interface for
   signaling.  The overhead associated with sending/receiving a large
   number of signaling messages over the air interface has a direct
   impact on the overall capacity and cost for the operator.
   Optimization of the number of messages needed for using a service
   like Mobile IPv6 is of great concern.  As a result the use of IKE for
   Mobile IPv6 deployment is detrimental to the operators bottom line.

   Another downside of IKE for setting up the IPsec SA between the MN
   and HA is that IKE does not integrate very well with the Radius based
   AAA back-end.  Since operators rely on the AAA infrastrucure to
   provision subscribers as well as define profiles, keys etc. in the
   AAA-Home, there is no getting away from the use of AAA in cdma2000
   networks.  IKEv2 does address this problem.  However from a timeline
   perspective the availability of IKEv2 specifications for Mobile IPv6
   Operation with IKEv2 and the revised IPsec Architecture [RFC4877] and
   implementations did not meet the need of operators that are currently
   relying on 3GPP2 specifications.

Internet-Draft        Why authdata option for MIP6           August 2007


   In summary the current model of Mobile IPv6 deployment which mandates
   the existence of an IPsec SA between the MN and HA, as specified in
   RFCs 3775 and 3776, is too rigid and does not meet the requirements
   of operators building networks based on the cdma2000 [3GPP2
   X.S0011-D] specifications.  This is a problem that needs to be
   addressed in order to ensure wide-scale deployment of the protocol.


6.  Solution Proposal

   The above issues can be addressed by developing a solution that
   allows MIPv6 deployment that does not mandate the use of IPsec for
   securing the binding update and binding acknowledgment messages
   between the MN and HA.  A solution similar to the one that is used in
   Mobile IPv4 today can be applied to Mobile IPv6 as well.  The
   experience gained in deploying Mobile IPv4 in cdma2000 networks on a
   large scale can be reused for Mobile IPv6 also.  The only con-
   sideration is that the alternative solution should not be vulner-
   able to attacks that are otherwise prevented by the use of IPsec.
   Sections 4.1 and 4.2 describe the IPv4 based mobility architecture in
   cdma networks and IPv6 based mobility architecture in cdma Net- works
   respectively.

   this architecture, mobility is tightly integrated with the AAA
   infrastructure.  The Mobile is configured with a NAI (Network Access
   Identifier) and a MN-AAA Key. The MN-AAA key is a shared Key that is
   shared between the MN and the Home AAA server.

   Below is the access link setup procedure:

   1.   Bring up PPP on MN/PDSN (access router link).  PPP
        authentication is skipped.  Mobile IP Authentication is
        performed via the FA.
   2.   PDSN sends a Mobile IP challenge to the MN on PPP link (RFC
        3012).
   3.   MN sends a MIP registration request (RRQ), which includes the
        users NAI, challenge and a MN-AAA extension which has challenge
        response and a MN-HA extension which is generated based on the
        MN-HA key.
   4.   PDSN extracts the MIP NAI/Challenge and response from MIP MN-AAA
        extension sends an Access Request to F-AAA (challenge/response
        using MD5).
   5.   F-AAA may forward it to H-AAA if needed (based on realm).
   6.   AAA authenticates the chap-challenge/response and returns
        "success" if authentication succeeds.
   7.   PDSN forwards Registration Request (RRQ) to HA.
   8.   HA authenticates the RRQ (MHAE extension).  HA may optionally
        authenticate with AAA infrastructure (just like PDSN as in #4).
   9.   If authentication is successful, HA creates a binding and sends
        a success Registration Reply (RRP) to PDSN.
   10.  PDSN creates a visitor entry and forwards the RRP to MN.

6.2.  IPv6 based mobility architecture in cdma2000 networks

   Due to the need for co-existence with MIPv4, and having the same
   operational model, the 3GPP2 standards body is adopting the following
   mobility architecture for MIPv6.

   Figure 2: cdma2000 packet data network architecture with Mobile IPv6

   The Mobile is configured with an NAI (Network Access Identifier) and
   a MN-AAA Key. The MN-AAA key is a shared Key between the MN and the
   Home AAA server.

6.2.1.  Overview of the mobility operation in IPv6 based cdma2000
        networks

   The following steps explain at a very generic level the operation of
   IP mobility in cdma2000 networks:

   1.  The MN performs Link Layer establishment.  This includes setting
       up the PPP link.  PPP-Chap authentication is performed.  This is
       authenticated by the PDSN/AR by sending an Access Request to the
       F-AAA (and to the H-AAA when/if needed).  Optionally, the MN
       acquires bootstrap information from the Home Network (via the
       PDSN; PDSN receives this information in Access Accept).  The
       bootstrap information includes Home address and Home agent
       assignment.  The MN uses stateless DHCPv6 [RFC3736] to obtain the
       bootstrap information from the PDSN.
   2.  The MN begins to use the HoA that was assigned in step 1.  If no
       HoA was assigned at step 1, the MN generates (auto-configures) an
       IPv6 global unicast address based on the prefix information
       received at step 1.
   3.  At this step the MN sends a Binding Update to the selected Home
       Agent.  In the BU, the MN includes the NAI option, timestamp
       option and MN-AAA auth option.

   4.  The HA extracts the NAI, authenticator etc. from the BU and sends
       an access request to the Home RADIUS server.
   5.  The Home RADIUS server authenticates and authorizes the user and
       sends back a RADIUS Access-Accept to the HA indicating successful
       authentication and authorization.
   6.  At this step the HA performs a replay check with the ID field in
       the received BU.  The HA also performs proxy Duplicate Address
       Detection (DAD) on the MN's home address (global) using proxy
       Neighbor Solicitation as specified in RFC 2461.
   7.  Assuming that proxy DAD is successful, the HA sends back a
       Binding Acknowledgment to the MN.  In this BA message the HA
       includes the MN-HA mobility option, NAI mobility option and the
       ID mobility option.

6.2.2.  Authentication and Security details

   Access Link Setup, Access Authentication and Bootstrapping:

   1.  MN brings up PPP session.  PDSN triggers the MN to perform CHAP
       authentication, as part of access authentication, while bringing
       up PPP link.
   2.  The MN is authenticated using PPP-CHAP by the H-AAA (Home AAA),
       via the F-AAA (Foreign AAA).
   3.  H-AAA may optionally send HoA and HA IP address to the PDSN for
       bootstrapping the MN (skipping details).

   4.  MN sends Binding Update (BU) to the HA.  Binding Update is
       authenticated using MN-AAA option.  The authenticator in MN-AAA
       option is calculated using hash of BU and MN-AAA shared key.  It
       uses HMAC_SHA1 algorithm.  The SPI field in MN-AAA is set to 3
       (defined in the draft) BU also includes NAI and timestamp among
       other details.  The hash of BU includes the 'timestamp' option
       and thus provides proof of liveness to prevent replay.
   5.  HA on receiving the BU, extracts the NAI, timestamp,
       authenticator from MN-AAA option and generates hash of BU.  HA
       sends an Access Request to the AAA and puts this information in
       3gpp2 defined VSAs (Vendor Specific Attributes).  The NAI is put
       in username in Access Request.  The other attributes sent are:
       timestamp option, hash of the BU (till SPI field of MN-AAA auth
       option) and the authentication data from MN-AAA auth option.
   6.  AAA (Radius server which interprets these attributes),
       authenticates the MN based on the hash of BU and authenticator.
       Proceed to step 7
   7.  AAA calculates a session key based on MN-AAA shared secret and
       timestamp and sends this to HA in Access-Accept (in a 3gpp2
       defined VSA).
   8.  (skipping details for timestamp processing at HA) HA creates a
       binding and a security association per Authentication Protocol
       for MIP6 [RFC4285].  The key for this association is retrieved
       from Access Accept and is referred to as session key.  HA

       associates a fixed SPI of 5 with this SA and is associated with
       the binding for the MN
   9.  HA sends a Binding Acknowledgement (BA) to the MN.  BA has the
       MN-HA authentication option, authenticated using the session key.
       This option has the SPI set to 5.
   10.  On receiving a BA, MN calculates the session-key (using same
       method as AAA) and associates it with SPI value of 5.

   MN derives the session key and SA using the timestamp in the BU that
   the MN sent and the MN-AAA shared key.  The MN uses this key to
   authenticate the MN-HA option in Binding Ack. If authentication is
   successful, MN creates a security association with SPI=5.  This key
   is used to authenticate further BU to the HA using the MN-HA auth
   option.  Once the binding lifetime expires and binding is deleted,
   the binding as well as the security association based on the
   Integrity Key is removed at the MN and HA.

   Migration from MobileIPv4 to MobileIPv6 utilizes the same network
   architecture and specially the same AAA infrastructure.  Thus, it is
   natural to have similar signaling in MIP6 as in MIP4, specifically
   the authentication with AAA infrastructure.


7.  Security Considerations

   The security requirements for the signaling messages between the MN
   and HA when using the authentication option mechanism are the same as
   those when using IPsec to secure them.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.


9.  Conclusion

   Mobile IPv6 has been standardized only recently.  Deployment of this
   protocol on a large scale is in the interest of the IETF and the
   working group as well as the many people who have worked on this.  A
   rigid model for deployment will cause the protocol to be limited to
   an academic exercise only.  It is extremely critical that the working
   group consider the needs of the industry and the deployment scenarios
   and address them accordingly.  This document captures the reasoning
   behind the need for the authentication protocol which has been
   published as RFC 4285.  It should be noted that the key length
   proposed in RFC 4285 was 16 octets in length.  This was considered as
   being weak.  The issue is being corrected by increasing the key
