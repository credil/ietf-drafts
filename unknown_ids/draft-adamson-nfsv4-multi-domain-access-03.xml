	<section title="Introduction">

	    <t>The <xref target="RFC3530">NFS Version 4</xref> protocol
		enables the construction of a distributed file system
		which can join NFSv4.0 or <xref
		    target="I-D.ietf-nfsv4-minorversion1">NFSv4.1</xref>
		servers from multiple administrative domains, each
		potentially using separate
		name resolution services and separate security services,
		into a common multi-domain name space.</t>

	    <t>NFSv4 deals with two kinds of identities: authentication
		identities (referred to here as "principals") and
		authorization identities ("users" and "groups" of
		users).  NFSv4 supports multiple authentication methods,
		each authenticating an "initiator principal" (typically
		representing a user) to an "acceptor principals" (always
		corresponding to the server).  NFSv4 does not prescribe
		how to represent authorization identities on file
		systems.  All file access decisions constitute
		"authorization" and are made by servers using
		information about client principals (such as username,
		group memberships, and so on) and file metadata related
		to authorization, such as a file's access control list
		(ACL).</t>

	    <t>Authentication in NFSv4 occurs at the the <xref
		    target="RFC2203">RPCSEC_GSS</xref> layer where
		GSS-API mechanisms <xref target="RFC2743"></xref>
		are used to authenticate users on NFSv4 clients to NFSv4
		servers, and to provide security services such as
		confidentiality and integrity protection for the
		protocol's messages.  The NFSv4 protocol specifies no
		particular representation for authentication identities
		as these are entirely GSS-API mechanism-specific.</t>

	    <t>Authorization for file object access is done at the NFSv4
		protocol layer (i.e., above the RPCSEC_GSS layer), on
		the server side, based on an authenticated client
		principal's authorization context and the authorization
		meta-data of the file system objects that the client
		wishes to access.  File authorization meta-data is set
		and retrieved in the NFSv4 <xref
		    target="RFC1831">RPC</xref> layer, specifically via
		the object's owner, owner_group and acl, dacl and sacl
		attributes (the last three being ACLs).  ACLs are lists
		of ACL entries (ACEs).  Each ACE has a "who" field
		identifying a subject to whom some permission is granted
		or denied.  The owner and owner_group attributes and the
		who ACE field, all reference users and groups.  On the
		wire, the protocol represents users and groups as
		strings of characters with this form: name@domain, where
		&lt;name&gt; is a user or group name, and &lt;domain&gt;
		is a the name of an administrative domain, more
		specifically a <xref target="RFC1034">DNS</xref>
		domainname.</t>

	    <t>NFSv4 server implementations usually do not, and really
		ought not, store authorization identities on disk in the
		same form as is used on the wire.  The reason is that
		users' and groups' names change all too often, while
		searching for and updating file authorization meta-data
		after a user/group name change is not trivial,
		particularly in a global namespace spanning multiple
		administrative domains.</t>

	    <t>NFSv4 servers therefore must perform two kinds of
		mappings: a) authentication identity to authorization
		context (a principal's user ID, group memberships,
		etcetera), and on-the-wire authorization identity
		representation to on-disk authorization identity
		representation.  Many aspects of these mappings are
		entirely implementation-specific, but some require name
		resolution services, and in order to interoperate
		servers must use such services in compatible ways.  Many
		implementations are limited to being able to represent
		users and groups from a single domain.</t>

	    <t>In this document we address both of those kind of
		mappings, describing possible implementation strategies,
		and specifying a name service for interoperation in a
		global namespace <xref
		    target="I-D.ietf-nfsv4-federated-fs-reqts"></xref>.</t>

	</section>  <!--Introduction --> 

	<section title="Background">

	    <t>NFSv4 uses a syntax of the form "name@domain" to
		represent, on the wire, the NFSv4 ACL name for users and
		groups.  This design provides a level of indirection
		that allows a client and server with different internal
		representations of authorization identity to
		interoperate even when referring to authorization
		identities from different administrative domains.</t>

	    <t>Multi-domain capable sites need to meet certain
		requirements in order to ensure that clients and servers
		can map name@domain to internal representations
		reliably:</t>

	    <t>
		<list style="symbols">

		    <t>name@domain MUST be unique within the DNS domain.</t>

		    <t>Every local representation of a user and of a
			group MUST have a canonical name@domain, and it
			must be possible to return the canonical
			name@domain for any identity stored on disk, at
			least when required infrastructure servers (such
			as name services) are online.</t>

		</list>
	    </t>

		<preamble>
		    As described in <xref
			target="I-D.ietf-nfsv4-minorversion1"></xref>
		    section 2.2.1.1 "RPC Security Flavors":
		</preamble>

		<artwork>
        NFSv4.1 clients and servers MUST implement RPCSEC_GSS.  (This
        requirement to implement is not a requirement to use.)  Other
        flavors, such as AUTH_NONE, and AUTH_SYS, MAY be implemented
        as well.
		</artwork>
	    </figure>

	    <t>The AUTH_NONE security flavor can be useful to the
		multi-domain NFSv4 or federated name space to grant
		universal access to public data without any credentials.</t>

	    <t>The AUTH_SYS security flavor uses a host-based
		authentication model where the [weakly-authenticated]
		client asserts the user's authorization identities using
		small integers as user and group identity
		representations.  Because of the small integer
		authorization ID representation, AUTH_SYS can only be
		used in a name space where all clients and servers share
		a uidNumber and gidNumber translation service.  A shared
		translation service is required because uidNumbers and
		gidNumbers are passed in the RPC credential; there is no
		negotiation of namespace in AUTH_SYS.  Collisions can
		occur if multiple translation services are used.  These
		and other issues are addressed in <xref
		    target="I-D.williams-rpcsecgssv3"/> which describes
		a new version of RPCSEC_GSS that includes a modernized
		replacement for AUTH_SYS.</t>

		<list style="hanging">

		    <t>Identity: a way to refer to a user or group.</t>

		    <t>Principal: an entity that is authenticated by
			RPCSEC_GSS (usually, but not always, a user;
			rarely, if ever, a group; sometimes a host).</t>

		    <t>Authorization context: the set of user and group
			IDs, privileges, labels, and other items
			relevant to authorization, corresponding to a
			subject (user or principal).</t>

		    <t>Domain-local ID: Most installations assign
			numeric, local identifiers to users and groups,

			call this a domain-local ID.</t>

		    <t>Local representation of identity: an item such as
			a POSIX user IDentifier (UID) or group ID (GID),
			or a Windows Security IDentifier (SID), or other
			such local representation of a user or a group
			of users.</t>

		    <t>Global representation of identity: a tuple
			consisting of a domain identifier (possibly the
			domain's name itself) and a domain-local
			user/group ID.  We do not propose a standard
			global representation of identity, but the
			concept is useful.</t>

		    <t>Group: a security entity representing zero, one or
		       more users and, possibly, other groups.  Can appear
		       as the subject of an ACE.</t>

		    <t>Domain: a set of users, groups and computers
		       administered by a single entity, and identified by
		       a DNS domain name.</t>

		    <t>POSIX IDs: small non-negative integers (typically
			0..2^31 or 0..2^32) identifiers.  The namespace
			of user IDs (UIDs) is distinct from the
			namespace of group IDs (GIDs).</t>

		    <t>Windows SIDs: an identifier of security entities,
			including users and groups.  The form of a SID
			is:
			S-1-&lt;authority&gt;&lt;RID_0&gt;&lt;RID_1&gt;&lt;RID_n&gt;
			By convention some authority numbers denote
			security entities, identified by RID_n, local to
			a domain identified by RIDs 0..n-1.  Domain RIDs
			are usually generated randomly within a "forest"
			of domains.</t>

		    <t>Name resolution: mapping from {domain, name} to
			{domain, ID}, and vice-versa via lookups. Can be
			applied to local or remote domains.</t>

		    <t>ID mapping: {remote domain, remote domain-local ID}
		       to {local representation of ID} mappings.</t>

	<section anchor="ONDISK" title="Local Representations of Global Identity">

	    <t>Multi-domain support starts at the fileserver where local
		ID forms need to be able to represent global identities
		from both, local and remote domains.  Local
		representation of global identity also applies to
		clients, particularly clients with local filesystems.
		There's a range of local solutions to this multi-domain
		ID representation problem. In this section we describe
		several approaches to representing a
		&lt;name&gt;@&lt;local or remote domain&gt; on disk.
		None of these approaches are REQUIRED; all are
		INFORMATIVE.  However, conventions relating to the use
		of name services are NORMATIVE.</t>

	    <section title="Storing Name@Domainname">

		<t>One simple approach to the multiple domain problem is
		    the identity function applied to name@domain, with
		    the resultant ID stored on disk.</t>
		
		<t>This approach imposes a severe constraint on the
		    administrators of these domains: user and group
		    names must never be reused, as there is also no
		    realistic way to keep the name@domain on disk
		    representation up to date with user, group or domain
		    renames and removals.  Consider a remote domain's
		    NFSv4 servers where real-time employee join/leave
		    data may be (typically is!) considered privileged,
		    and remote servers may not be sufficiently
		    privileged to access it [elaborate...].</t>

	    </section>

	    <section anchor="ID@DOMAIN" title="Storing Remote-ID@Domainname">

		<t>Most installations assign numeric, local identifiers
		    to users and groups, using a namespace local to
		    their domain.  We call this a domain-local ID.  We
		    can then construct a global identity form consisting
		    of a domain ID and a domain-local user/group ID.</t>

		<t>The user or group renaming issue can be addressed by
		    using a global identity form where domain-local IDs
		    are required.  I.e., use name resolution to lookup
		    name@domain to find the ID local to the domain, and
		    join the ID with the result of the identity function
		    applied to the domain.  This function still has
		    a renaming problem with respect to DNS domain
		    renames, but that is a more realistically manageable
		    problem than the user/group renaming problem.</t>

		<section anchor="STORE" title="Storing Remote-ID@Domain-ID">

		    <t>The DNS domain renaming issue in the previous
			section can be addressed by assigning and
			publishing a unique ID to each DNS domain.
			I.e., use name resolution to lookup name@domain
			to find some ID local to the domain, lookup the
			domain ID and store &lt;remote-ID,domain-ID&gt;.</t>

		</section>
	    </section>

	    <section anchor="ID-MAPPING" title="ID Mapping">

		<t>Many file systems exported by NFS only store
		    32-bit user and group IDs which limit their
		    ability to utilize the on disk representation
		    described in <xref target="ID@DOMAIN"></xref>.
		    Such systems may need to use an additional
		    service to map between
		    &lt;remote user ID, local user IDs&gt; and
		    &lt;remote group IDs, local group IDs&gt;.
		    We call this an "ID mapping service".</t>

		<t>The use of an ID mapping service is not strictly
		    necessary if the system operates on IDs large
		    enough and in a known format such that
		    &lt;user/group ID, domain ID&gt; can be parsed and
		    encoded into a native ID.
		    However, a large class of operating systems,
		    those which are Unix or Unix-like operating
		    systems, such as Solaris and Linux, use 32-bit
		    UIDs and GIDs in many interfaces and therefore need
		    mapping for backwards compatibility reasons.</t>

		<t>One example of such a service is to keep a local
		    or distributed database for dynamically
		    assigning a local 32 bit ID to every
		    &lt;ID&gt;@&lt;domain-ID&gt;, or one could do
		    that only for remote domains, reserving only a
		    small part of the local 32-bit ID namespace for
		    remote domains' users/groups.</t>

		<t>The remote ID and remote domain are then used as
		    inputs to a name resolution service which
		    contacts the remote domain name service to
		    resolve the remote name.</t>

	    </section>

		<section title="Use of Name Services">

		    <t>File systems often use a distributed
			directory service for resolving domain local 32
			bit IDs to users and groups.  The <xref
			target="NIS">Network Information
			Service</xref> and the <xref
			target="RFC4511">Lightweight Directory
			Access Protocol</xref> are the two broadly
			deployed distributed directory service protocols
			used for this purpose.  LDAP is used instead of NIS in
			environments where scalabilty, security and/or
			extensibility are desired.
			<xref target="LDAP-EXT"></xref> expands
			the LDAP protocol to include mappings between
			principals and local user and group IDs.</t>

		    <t>Support for LDAP <xref target="RFC4511"/> with

			REQUIRED.</t>
		    
		    <section anchor="USING-LDAP" title="Using LDAP with RFC2307 Schema">

			<t>Name resolution consists of searches with
			    scope 'sub', a base DN corresponding to a
			    domain (more on this below) and a filter of
			    either of these forms, with matching on
			    objectClass being optional:</t>

			<t>The base DN SHOULD be formatted from a

			    prepend "DC=" to the resulting string.  For
			    example, foo.bar.example becomes
			    "DC=foo,DC=bar,DC=example".  This convention
			    is REQUIRED to be implemented.  Domains with

	<section anchor="V4ACCESS" title="GSS-API Principal-to-Authorization Context">

	    <t>In order to authorize user access to files, the NFS
		server must map the RPCSEC_GSS client principal name or
		the underlying GSS-API security context to local
		security information including a local ID, a set of
		local group IDs and other local user privileges.  This security
		information is contained in an "authorization context"
		(also called an "access token" in some systems).</t>


	    <t>We define an RPCSEC_GSS authorization context as follows.
	        The authorization context contains domain-local user and
	        group IDs that may need to be mapped to local IDs as described
	        in <xref target="ID-MAPPING"></xref> when presented to 
	        a remote domain. The name@domain form is
	        included to aid the NFSv4 server in remote domain name service
	        queries.</t>

	    <t>RPCSEC_GSS authorization contexts consist of:</t>

	    <t>
		<list style="numbers">

		    <t>UserID: This field contains the principal's
			global ID and/or local ID mapping thereof, and

		    <t>PrimaryGroupID: This field contains the global ID

			as well as in name@domain forms.</t>

		    <t>As yet unspecified field(s) for privileges and

	    </t>

	    <t>The RPCSEC_GSS client principal authorization context
		determination may be mechanism-specific, and even

	    <t>The RPCSEC_GSS authorization context SHOULD be obtained via
		a GSS-API name attribute
		<xref target="I-D.ietf-kitten-gssapi-naming-exts"/>
		or via discrete GSS-API name attributes
		corresponding to the above authorization context elements.
		URLs for those attributes are TBD.  If the
		named attribute interface is not available, or the
		attributes are not available, other means of determining
		a principal's authorization context SHOULD be used, such
		as those described in <xref target="AUTHCRED"></xref>
		and <xref target="PRINC_TO_USER"></xref>.</t>

	    <section anchor="AUTHCRED" title="Using Credential Authorization Data">

		<t>Authorization context information can sometimes be
		    obtained from the credentials authenticating a

		    a method for conveying "authorization data", both
		    client-asserted as well as KDC-authenticated
		    authorization data, and one KDC implementation uses
		    this feature to convey a "privilege attribute
		    certificate" (PAC) listing the principal's user and

		<section title="User Group Membership Determination">

		    <t>User group membership is easy to determine for users in
		       a system's local domain: the operating system will
		       already know how to do that. </t>

		    <t>User group membership in remote domain's groups, or
		       for remote users, may be determined using LDAP with
		       the RFC2307 schema.  The RFC2307 schema does not define
		       the values of the 'memberUid' attribute, but
		       in practice it seems that those are expected to be the
		       names of users as found in the 'uid' attribute of
		       'posixAccount' entries.  There is work in progress to
		       update RFC2307
		       <xref target="I-D.howard-rfc2307bis"></xref> to allow the
		       use of DNs in the memberUid attribute, which also
		       enables  as group nesting.  Such use of memberUid
		       should be backwards-compatible, since implementations
		       that don't know about that use of memberUid should end
		       up ignoring values which are not plain usernames. </t>

		    <t>Assuming the ability to store DNs in the memberUid
		       attribute, then, group membership determination can be
		       done as follows.  Given a user ID whose DN has been
		       determined:
		       <list style="numbers">

                       <t>Search the user's domain for groups that the user is
                          a member of in the user's home domain.  Filter out
                          groups that are not local to the user's home domain.
                       </t>
                       <t>Search the server's domain for groups that the user
                          is a member of in the server's home domain.
                       </t>
                       <t>Search the server's domain for groups that the
                          user's group memberships determined in steps 1 and
                          2 are members of.
                       </t>
                       <t>Continue searching for nested group memberships
                          given the list of groups from steps 2 and 3 while
                          being careful to detect or prevent loops.
                       </t>
                    </list> </t>

                    <t>However, the above procedure has the same user/group
                       name renaming issue.  By skipping step 2 we can get
                       down to just a group renaming issue.  To fully address
                       the rename issue we need either a new attribute or
                       value type for memberUid, storing user/group IDs in
                       some global ID representation.  </t>

	<section title="Name Resolution and LDAP Caching">

	    <t>As noted in <xref target="ID@DOMAIN"></xref>, most local
		representations require a name service to perform ID to
		name translations.  Implementations are REQUIRED to
		support the use of LDAP as a name service, relying on
		LDAP referrals for federated namespace construction.</t>

	    <t>Note that in a topographically widely separated set of
		domains the need to do name service lookups in various
		domains' name services may prove brittle, resulting in
		non-deterministic server behavior (e.g., sometimes a
		user can access share, sometimes they cannot; sometimes
		they appear to be members of some group, sometimes they
		do not).  To avoid this, site administrators may wish to
		maintain local caches of remote domains' name
		services such that LDAP searches for users/groups in
		remote domains can be satisfied locally for some set of
		key attributes (such as naming and ID attributes), with
		referrals used in all other cases.</t>

	    <t>Domains in a federated namespace may provide each other
		with LDAP LDIF delta feeds by which to maintain cached
		LDAP contents up to date.The LDAP DN hierarchy described in
	        <xref target="USING-LDAP"></xref> has the advantage of
	        aiding delta feeds from remote domains where each
		domains' information is in it's own DN subtree.</t>

	</section> <!-- Name Resolution and LDAP Caching Proxies -->

	<section title="Security Considerations">

	    <t>Caching of remote domains' LDAP search results persents some
	       security considerations.  For example, some attributes'
	       values may not be visible unless a user's credentials
	       are used.  Some attributes' values may not be intended
	       to be visible to users, but to hosts.  Caching servers
	       MUST be capable of issuing referrals as needed for
	       attributes whose values they may not read.  Some domain
	       federations will want to have their domains trust each
	       others' caching servers.</t>
