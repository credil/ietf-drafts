Abstract 

   While the current GMPLS WSON framework can deal with many types of 
   wavelength switching systems there is a desire to extend this control 
   plane to include other common optical or hybrid electro optical 
   systems such as OEO switches, regenerators, and wavelength 
   converters. Such systems can be limited to processing only certain 
   types of WSON signals. In addition, if such a system can support more 
   than one type of WSON signal it may need to be provisioned as to the 
   characteristics of the signal that it will be processing. 

   This document provides a WSON signal definition and characterization 
   based on ITU-T interface and signal class standards and describes the 
   signal compatibility constraints of this extended set of network 
   elements. The signal characterization and network element 
   compatibility constraints enable GMPLS routing and signaling to 
   control these devices and PCE to compute optical light-paths subject 
   to signal compatibility attributes.

1. Introduction  

   The current GMPLS WSON formalism can deal with many types of 
   wavelength switching systems. However, there is an implicit 
   assumption that all signals used in a WSON are compatible with all 
   network elements. This arises in practice for a number of reasons (a) 
   in some WSONs only one class of signal is used throughout the 
   network, or (b)only "relatively" transparent network elements are 
   utilized in the WSON. Assumption (a) limits the inherent flexibility 
   that carriers seek from a WSON and assumption (b) leaves out very 
   common optical network elements including regenerators, OEO switches, 
   and wavelength converters. 

   Therefore there is a desire to extend the WSON control plane to  
   allow both multiple WSON signal types and common hybrid electro 
   optical systems. In the following we characterize WSON signals in 
   line with ITU-T standards, and add attributes describing signal 
   compatibility constraints to WSON network elements. This way the 
   control plane signaling and path computation functions can ensure 
   "signal" compatibility between source, sink and any links or network 
   elements as part of path selection process, and configure devices 
   appropriately via signaling as part of the connection provisioning 
   process. This enables integration of a WSON into the operations of a 
   signal network for which it provides connectivity instead of 
   requiring the WSON to be separately managed and controlled.  

2. Electro-Optical Systems 

   It turns out OEO switches, wavelength converters and regenerators all 
   share a similar property: they can be more or less "transparent" to 
   an "optical signal" depending on their functionality and/or 
   implementation. Regenerators have been fairly well characterized in 
   this regard so we start by describing their properties. 


2.1. Regenerators 
   The various approaches to regeneration are discussed in ITU-T G.872 
   Annex A [G.872]. They map a number of functions into the so-called 
   1R, 2R and 3R categories of regenerators as summarized in Table 1 
   below:

   Table 1 Regenerator functionality mapped to general regenerator 
   classes from [G.872]. 

   --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
   1R | Equal amplification of all frequencies within the amplification  
      | bandwidth. There is no restriction upon information formats. 
      +----------------------------------------------------------------- 
      | Amplification with different gain for frequencies within the  
      | amplification bandwidth. This could be applied to both single- 
      | channel and multi-channel systems. 
      +----------------------------------------------------------------- 
      | Dispersion compensation (phase distortion). This analogue  
      | process can be applied in either single-channel or multi- 
      | channel systems. 
   --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
   2R | Any or all 1R functions. Noise suppression. 
      +----------------------------------------------------------------- 
      | Digital reshaping (Schmitt Trigger function) with no clock  
      | recovery. This is applicable to individual channels and can be  
      | used for different bit rates but is not transparent to line  
      | coding (modulation). 
   -------------------------------------------------------------------- 
   3R | Any or all 1R and 2R functions. Complete regeneration of the  
      | pulse shape including clock recovery and retiming within  
      | required jitter limits. 
   -------------------------------------------------------------------- 

   From the previous table we can see that 1R regenerators are generally 
   independent of signal modulation format (also known as line coding), 
   but may work over a limited range of wavelength/frequencies.  We see 
   that 2R regenerators are generally applicable to a single digital 
   stream and are dependent upon modulation format (line coding) and to 
   a lesser extent are limited to a range of bit rates (but not a 
   specific bit rate). Finally, 3R regenerators apply to a single 
   channel, are dependent upon the modulation format and generally 
   sensitive to the bit rate of digital signal, i.e., either are 
   designed to only handle a specific bit rate or need to be programmed 
   to accept and regenerate a specific bit rate.  In all these types of 
   regenerators the digital bit stream(s) contained within the optical 
   or electrical is/(are) not modified. 

   In the most common usage of regenerators the digital bit stream may 
   be slightly modified for performance monitoring and fault management 
   purposes. SONET, SDH and G.709 all have a digital signal "envelope" 
   designed to be used between "regenerators" (in this case 3R 
   regenerators). In SONET this is known as the "section" signal, in SDH 
   this is known as the "regenerator section" signal, in G.709 this is 
   known as an OTUk (Optical Channel Transport Unit-k).  These signals

   reserve a portion of their frame structure (known as overhead) for 
   use by regenerators. The nature of this overhead is summarized in 
   Table 2.

   In the previous table we see support for frame alignment, signal 
   identification, and FEC. What this table also shows by its omission 
   is that no switching or multiplexing occurs at this layer. This is a 
   significant simplification for the control plane since control plane 
   standards require a multi-layer approach when there are multiple 
   switching layers, but not for "layering" to provide the management 
   functions of Table 2. That is, many existing technologies covered by 
   GMPLS contain extra management related layers that are essentially 
   ignored by the control plane (though not by the management plane!). 
   Hence, the approach here is to include regenerators and other devices 
   at the WSON layer unless they provide higher layer switching and then 
   a multi-layer or multi-region approach [RFC5212] is called for. 

   In a sense dependence on client signal type represents a fourth 
   regenerator type, i.e., 4R, that includes all the capabilities and

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks       August 2009 
    

   restrictions of a 3R, 2R, and 1R, and in addition is depending upon 
   the format of the digital stream, i.e., these regenerators can accept 
   only one type of stream or must be programmed to accommodate 
   different stream types. 

   Hence we see that depending upon the regenerator technology we may 
   have the following constraints imposed by a regenerator device: 

            List 1. Network Element Compatibility Constraints 

   1.  Limited wavelength range (1R) -- Already modeled in GMPLS for 
      WSON 

   2.  Modulation type restriction (2R) 

   3.  Bit rate range restriction (2R, 3R) 

   4.  Exact bit rate restriction (3R) 

   5.  Client signal dependence (4R) 


2.2. OEO Switches 
   A common place where optical-to-electrical-to-optical (OEO) 
   processing may take place is in WSON switches that utilize (or 
   contain) regenerators. A vendor may add regenerators to a switching 
   system for a number of reasons. One obvious reason is to restore 
   signal quality either before or after optical processing (switching).  
   Another reason may be to convert the signal to an electronic form for 
   switching then reconverting to an optical signal prior to egress from 
   the switch. In this later case the regeneration is applied to adapt 
   the signal to the switch fabric regardless of whether or not it is 
   needed from a signal quality perspective.  

   In either case these optical switches have the following signal 
   processing restrictions that are essentially the same as those we 
   described for regenerators in List 1. 

   Note that a common system integration function in transport networks 
   is to add multi-channel WDM interfaces to electro-optical switching 
   systems such as G.709, SONET, SDH, IP, or Ethernet switching systems.  
   Although such systems may have high layer switching functionality 
   they, by their nature contain WSON functionality, though this maybe 
   in the form of fixed WDM multiplexing and de-multiplexing 
   functionality. See [WSON-FRAME] for how GMPLS WSON can model fixed 
   devices. If they only contain higher layer (IP, Ethernet, SONET path, 
   etc...) functionality then these systems act as a termination point 
     

   Bernstein and Lee Expires February 17, 2010  [Page 6] 

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks       August 2009 
    

   for the WSON switching layer, otherwise they look like a combination 
   of WSON end system and WSON switching system and could contain OEO 
   conversions. 

   Integrating WSON capabilities into electro-optical switching systems 
   brings the WSON network into the operational domain of these systems 
   and higher layer networks.  By adding optical tributary attributes to 
   the GMPLS control protocols this draft enables the integration of 
   WSON subnetworks into the higher layer networks within which they 
   reside and to which they provide flexible connectivity.  This 
   streamlines network operations by enabling a single request to 
   establish a connection across both electro-optical and all optical 
   elements within a higher layer network.  The optical tributary 
   attributes for a connection may be set based on the related 
   attributes of the network element at the boundary of each new WSON 
   subnetwork traversed by the connection. 


2.3. Wavelength Converters 
   In [WSON-FRAME] the motivation for utilizing wavelength converters 
   was discussed. In essence a wavelength converter would take one or 
   more optical channels on specific wavelengths and convert them to 
   corresponding new specific wavelengths. Currently all optical 
   wavelength converters exist but have not been widely deployed, hence 
   the majority of wavelength converters are based on demodulation to an 
   electrical signal and then re-modulation onto a new optical carrier, 
   i.e., an OEO process. This process is very similar to that used for a 
   regenerator except that the output optical wavelength will be 
   different from the input optical wavelength. Hence in general 
   wavelength converters have signal processing restrictions that are 
   essentially the same as those we described for regenerators in List 
   1: 

   (a)   Limited input wavelength range (1R), Limited output wavelength 
     range 

   (b)    Modulation type restriction (2R) 

   (c)    Bit rate range restriction (2R, 3R) 

   (d)    Exact bit rate restriction (3R) 

   (e)    Client signal dependence (4R)

3. Describing Optical Signals in GMPLS 

   In the previous section we saw that each of the additional network 
   elements (OEO switches, regenerators, and wavelength converters) can 
   impose constraints on the types of signals they can "process". Hence 
   to enable the use of a larger set of network elements the first step 
   is to define and characterize our "optical signal". 

    
3.1. Optical Interfaces 

   In wavelength switched optical networks (WSONs) our fundamental unit 
   of switching is intuitively that of a "wavelength". The transmitters 
   and receivers in these networks will deal with one wavelength at a 
   time, while the switching systems themselves can deal with multiple 
   wavelengths at a time. Hence we are generally concerned with 
   multichannel dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) networks 
   with single channel interfaces. Interfaces of this type are defined 
   in ITU-T recommendations [G.698.1] and [G.698.1]. Key non-impairment 
   related parameters defined in [G.698.1] and [G.698.2] are: 

   (a)   Minimum Channel Spacing (GHz) 

   (b)   Bit-rate/Line coding of optical tributary signals 

   (c)   Minimum and Maximum central frequency 

   We see that (a) and (c) above are related to properties of the link 
   and have been modeled in [Otani],[WSON-FRAME], [WSON-Info] and (b) is 
   related to the "signal".  

3.2. Optical Tributary Signals 

   The optical interface specifications [G.698.1], [G.698.2], and 
   [G.959.1] all use the concept of an Optical Tributary Signal which is 
   defined as "a single channel signal that is placed within an optical 
   channel for transport across the optical network". Note the use of 
   the qualifier "tributary" to indicate that this is a single channel 
   entity and not a multichannel optical signal. This is our candidate 
   terminology for the entity that we will be controlling in our GMPLS 
   extensions for WSONs. 

   There are a currently a number of different "flavors" of optical 
   tributary signals, known as "optical tributary signal classes". These 
   are currently characterized by a modulation format and bit rate range 
   [G.959.1]: 

   (a)   optical tributary signal class NRZ 1.25G 
     

   Bernstein and Lee Expires February 17, 2010  [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks       August 2009 
    

   (b)   optical tributary signal class NRZ 2.5G 

   (c)   optical tributary signal class NRZ 10G 

   (d)   optical tributary signal class NRZ 40G 

   (e)   optical tributary signal class RZ 40G 

   Note that with advances in technology more optical tributary signal 
   classes will be added and that this is currently an active area for 
   standardization. 

   Note that according to [G.698.2] it is important to fully specify the 
   bit rate of the optical tributary signal: 

   "When an optical system uses one of these codes, therefore, it is 
   necessary to specify both the application code and also the exact bit 
   rate of the system. In other words, there is no requirement for 
   equipment compliant with one of these codes to operate over the 
   complete range of bit rates specified for its optical tributary 
   signal class." 

   Hence we see that modulation format (optical tributary signal class) 
   and bit rate are key in characterizing the optical tributary signal. 


3.3. Proposed GMPLS WSON Signal Definition 
   We proposed to call the signal that we will be working with an 
   optical tributary signal like that defined in ITU-T G.698.1 and .2. 
   This is an "entity" that can be put on an optical communications 
   channel formed from links and network elements in a WSON. 

   An optical tributary signal has the following attributes: 

               List 2. Optical Tributary Signal Attributes 

  1. Optical tributary signal class: This relates to the specifics of 
     modulation format, and bit rate range. Could possibly change along 
     the path. For example when running through a 3R regenerator a 
     different output modulation format could be used. This could be 
     more prevalent if we are controlling combined metro and long haul 
     networks.  
  2. FEC: Indicates whether forward error correction is used in the 
     digital stream. Note that in [G.707] this is indicated in the 
     signal itself via the FEC status indication (FSI) byte, while in 

     

   Bernstein and Lee Expires February 17, 2010  [Page 9] 

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks       August 2009 
    

     [G.709] this can be inferred from whether the FEC field of the OTUk 
     is all zeros or not. 
  3. Bit rate. This typically would not change since we are not changing 
     the digital bit stream in any end-to-end meaningful way. 
  4. Center frequency (wavelength). Can change along path if there are 
     wavelength converters. This is already modeled via labels in GMPLS. 
  5. G-PID: General Protocol Identifier for the information format. This 
     would not change since this describes the encoded bit stream. This 
     is already present in GMPLS signaling. A set of G-PID values are 
     already defined for lambda switching in [RFC3471], [RFC4328]. 
  6. (Optional) A signal identifier or name distinguishing a particular 
     tributary signal from others in the network that may be used to 
     detect misconnection of signals. For example this can be used in 
     setting up the section trace in SDH or the trail trace identifier 
     in G.709 between format aware regenerators. This is not used in 
     determining signal compatibility with network elements and hence is 
     optional. 
 

   These attributes are used during RWA to select a compatible path for 
   the optical tributary signal. These attributes are used during 
   signaling to configure devices such as wavelength converters or 
   parameter sensitive devices such as 3R regenerators. Some of these 
   attributes such as wavelength may change as the optical tributary 
   signal traverses the path from source to sink.  

3.4. Implications for GMPLS Signaling and PCEP 

   When establishing a connection or requesting a path computation the 
   attributes of the optical tributary signal given in List 2 in section 
   3.3. needs to be furnished. However of these five attributes two are 
   already supplied in GMPLS signaling: wavelength and G-PID. This 
   leaves only four new types of attributes: 

   1.  Signal Class with possible qualifying parameters 

   2.  Bit Rate  

   3.  FEC information 

   4. Optional signal identifier 

   For RSVP-TE signaling these could be put in a new WSON T_SPEC object. 
   For PCEP these signal attributes would need to be included in various 
   request and response messages.

4. Characterizing WSON Network Elements in GMPLS 

   A number of processes may operate on an "optical tributary signal" as 
   it traverses a path through a network these include: Generation 
   (including modulation), Regeneration, Wavelength Conversion, 
   Switching and Reception (including demodulation). In any of these 
   processes a number of attributes of the "optical tributary signal" 
   may be either constrained or incompatible with those of the 
   processing elements. These attributes include: 

   (a)   Optical tributary signal class (modulation format and 
     approximate bit rate, FEC) 

   (b)   Exact bit rate 

   (c)   Center frequency (wavelength) 

   (d)   Digital stream format information  

   Qualification of a route involves determining that the route provides 
   a signal path capable of propagating the physical layer network 
   signal and meeting the input signal requirements of the termination 
   sink function (receiver).   

   Some of the previously mentioned attributes of our optical tributary 
   signal may change as the signal traverses its path across a network. 
   The most common of these would be center frequency (wavelength). 
   GMPLS signaling currently supports the specification of wavelength to 
   be used at a given point on a path. Less common, although, possible 
   would be a change in modulation format of the signal, particularly 
   after some type of OEO regeneration or switching. Currently GMPLS 
   signaling doesn't support indicating a change of modulation at a 
   particular point in the network. 

   The bulk of compatibility checking of network element capabilities 
   against optical tributary signal attributes would fall on the path 
   computation entity whose traffic engineering database is typically 
   constructed with the help of a link state IGP. Currently, only layer 
   type information is given in the form of the interface switching 
   capability descriptor (ISCD) from [RFC4202]. 


4.1. Proposed Link and Network Element (NE) Model Extensions 
   Other drafts  [WSON-FRAME],[WSON-Info] provide NE models that include 
   switching asymmetry and port wavelength constraints here we add 
     

   Bernstein and Lee Expires February 17, 2010  [Page 11] 

Internet-Draft   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks       August 2009 
    

   parameters to our existing node and link models to take into account 
   restrictions on the optical tributary signal attributes that a 
   network element can accept.  These are: 

  1. Permitted optical tributary signal classes: A list of optical 
     tributary signal classes that can be processed by this network 
     element or carried over this link. 
  2. Acceptable Bit Rate Set: A list of specific bit rates or bit rate 
     ranges that the device can accommodate. Coarse bit rate info is 
     included with the optical tributary signal class restrictions. 
  3. Acceptable G-PID list: A list of G-PIDs corresponding to the 
     "client" digital streams that are compatible with this device. 
    

   Note that such parameters could be specified on an (a) Network 
   element wide basis, (b) a per port basis, (c) on a per regenerator 
   basis.  Typically such information has been on a per port basis, 
   e.g., the GMPLS interface switching capability descriptor [RFC4202]. 
   However, in [WSON-FRAME] we give examples of shared wavelength 
   converters within a switching system, and hence this would be on a 
   subsystem basis. The exact form would be defined in the [WSON-Info] 
   and [WSON-Encoding] drafts. 

5. Security Considerations 

   This document has no requirement for a change to the security models 
   within GMPLS and associated protocols. That is the OSPF-TE, RSVP-TE, 
   and PCEP [RFC5540] security models could be operated unchanged.   
    
   Furthermore the additional information distributed in order to extend 
   GMPLS capabilities to the additional network elements discussed in 
   this document represents a disclosure of network capabilities that an 
   operator may wish to keep private. Consideration should be given to 
   securing this information.  

6. IANA Considerations 

   This document makes no request for IANA actions.
