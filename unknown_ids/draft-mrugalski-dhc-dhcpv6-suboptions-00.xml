    <abstract>
      <t>DHCPv6 clients may use Option Request Option (ORO) to
      specify, which options they would like to get configured by
      DHCPv6 servers. Clients may also be interested in specific
      options that do not appear in DHCPv6 message directly (top-level
      options), but rather as a compounds of other options
      (suboptions). This document defines way of using existing ORO to
      request for specific suboptions.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>There are 2 ways DHCPv6 client can inform a server about its
      intent to have an option configured. The first (mandatory) way
      is to send ORO. The second way (optional, can be used as an
      addition to the first one) is to send the actual requested
      option to provide hints for server. Unfortunately, this only
      solves the problem of requesting top-level options.</t>

      <t>Clients may also be interested in receiving specific
      sub-options (i.e. options that do not appear in DHCPv6 messages
      directly, but rather as components in other
      options). Unfortunately, this is no clear way for clients to
      request such sub-options. <xref target="RFC3315"/> does not
      provide any guidance regarding such problem.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Requesting Suboptions">
      <t>Clients that want specific suboptions provided by the server,
        include ORO in the top-level option that requested option is
        expected in. For example, if client expects to have suboption
        FOO configured in IA_NA, it should transmit IA_NA option that
        contains ORO. This ORO should convey a single FOO option
        code.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Justification">
      <t>Proposed approach allows clients to limit the amount of
      information parameters servers will send. This avoids larger
      than necessary DHCPv6 messages. With complex configuration
      parameters, like
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-mif-dhcpv6-route-option"/>, 
      the amount of available additional information may be
      significant.</t>

      <t>It was suggested that clients may use top-level ORO to
      express desire to receive specific suboptions. Several existing
      server implementations deal with all options in an uniform
      way. Using top-level ORO to request suboptions would cause
      server to misplace requested options (i.e. to place it as
      top-levle option rather than suboption). Avoiding such
      pitfalls, would complicate server implementation significantly,
      as server would have to be configured with extra information
      regarding each option (where does specific option is supposed
      to appear - top level or as suboption).</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="client" title="DHCPv6 Client Behavior">
      <t>Client includes ORO in each option that it would like to
      receive suboptions in. For example, if client wants to receive
      suboption FOO in IA_NA option, it SHOULD transmit IA_NA that
      contains a single ORO list.</t>
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="server" title="DHCPv6 Server Behavior">
      <t>Server processes the whole client message in a regular way,
      as explained in <xref target="RFC3315"/>. For each option that
      is allowed to have suboptions, server checks if there is ORO
      present within. Each returning top-level option, server
      populates its response with options specified in said ORO.</t>
