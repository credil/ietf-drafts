Abstract

   The MRCPv2 protocol allows client hosts to control media service
   resources such as speech synthesizers, recognizers, verifiers and
   identifiers residing in servers on the network.  MRCPv2 is not a
   "stand-alone" protocol - it relies on other protocols, such as
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to rendezvous MRCPv2 clients and
   servers and manage sessions between them, and the Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) to describe, discover and exchange capabilities.  It
   also depends on SIP and SDP to establish the media sessions and
   associated parameters between the media source or sink and the media
   server.  Once this is done, the MRCPv2 protocol exchange operates
   over the control session established above, allowing the client to
   control the media processing resources on the speech resource server.

1.  Introduction

   The MRCPv2 protocol is designed to allow a client device to control
   media processing resources on the network.  Some of these media
   processing resources include speech recognition engines, speech
   synthesis engines, speaker verification and speaker identification
   engines.  MRCPv2 enables the implementation of distributed
   Interactive Voice Response platforms using VoiceXML
   [W3C.REC-voicexml20-20040316] browsers or other client applications
   while maintaining separate back-end speech processing capabilities on
   specialized speech processing servers.  MRCPv2 is based on the
   earlier Media Resource Control Protocol (MRCP) [RFC4463] developed
   jointly by Cisco Systems, Inc., Nuance Communications, and
   Speechworks Inc.

   The protocol requirements of SPEECHSC [RFC4313] include that the
   solution be capable of reaching a media processing server and setting
   up communication channels to the media resources, and sending and
   receiving control messages and media streams to/from the server.  The
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] meets these requirements.

   Note the above mentioned requirements document, RFC 4313, goes into
   detail on alternatives to SIP, such as RTSP [RFC2326], and why MRCPv2
   does not use RTSP, even though the proprietary version of MRCP did
   run over RTSP.

   MRCPv2 leverages these capabilities by building upon SIP and the
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566].  MRCPv2 uses SIP to
   setup and tear down media and control sessions with the server.  In
   addition, the client can use a SIP re-INVITE method (an INVITE dialog
   sent within an existing SIP Session) to change the characteristics of
   these media and control session while maintaining the SIP dialog
   between the client and server.  SDP is used to describe the
   parameters of the media sessions associated with that dialog.  It is
   mandatory to support SIP as the session establishment protocol to
   ensure interoperability.  Other protocols can be used for session
   establishment by prior agreement.  This document only describes the
   use of SIP and SDP.

   MRCPv2 uses SIP and SDP to create the speech client/server dialog and
   set up the media channels to the server.  It also uses SIP and SDP to
   establish MRCPv2 control sessions between the client and the server
   for each media processing resource required for that dialog.  The
   MRCPv2 protocol exchange between the client and the media resource is
   carried on that control session.  MRCPv2 protocol exchanges do not
   change the state of the SIP dialog, the media sessions, or other
   parameters of the dialog initiated via SIP.  It controls and affects
   the state of the media processing resource associated with the MRCPv2

   session(s).

   MRCPv2 defines the messages to control the different media processing
   resources and the state machines required to guide their operation.
   It also describes how these messages are carried over a transport
   layer protocol such as TCP or TLS (Note: SCTP is a viable transport
   for MRCPv2 as well, but the mapping onto SCTP is not described in
   this specification).


2.  Document Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

   Since many of the definitions and syntax are identical to HTTP/1.1
   (RFC2616 [RFC2616]), this specification refers to the section where
   they are defined rather than copying it.  For brevity, [HX.Y] is to
   be taken to refer to Section X.Y of RFC2616.

   All the mechanisms specified in this document are described in both
   prose and an augmented Backus-Naur form (ABNF [RFC5234]).

   The complete message format in ABNF form is provided in Section 15
   and is the normative format definition.

2.1.  Definitions

   Media Resource
                  An entity on the speech processing server that can be
                  controlled through the MRCPv2 protocol.
   MRCP Server
                  Aggregate of one or more "Media Resource" entities on
                  a Server, exposed through the MRCPv2 protocol
                  ("Server" for short).
   MRCP Client
                  An entity controlling one or more Media Resources
                  through the MRCPv2 protocol ("Client" for short).
   DTMF
                  Dual Tone Multi-Frequency; a method of transmitting
                  key presses in-band, either as actual tones (Q.23
                  [Q.23]) or as named tone events (RFC4733 [RFC4733]).
   Endpointing
                  The process of automatically detecting the beginning
                  and end of speech in an audio stream.  This is
                  critical both for speech recognition and for automated
                  recording as one would find in voice mail systems.

   Hotword Mode
                  A mode of speech recognition where a stream of
                  utterances is evaluated for match against a small set
                  of command words.  This is generally employed to
                  either trigger some action, or to control the
                  subsequent grammar to be used for further recognition

2.2.  State-Machine Diagrams

   The state-machine diagrams in this document do not show every
   possible method call.  Rather, they reflect the state of the resource
   based on the methods that have moved to IN-PROGRESS or COMPLETE
   states (see Section 5.3).  Note that since PENDING requests
   essentially have not affected the resource yet and are in queue to be
   processed, they are not reflected in the state-machine diagrams.


3.  Architecture

   A system using MRCPv2 consists of a client that requires the
   generation and/or consumption of media streams and a media resource
   server that has the resources or "engines" to process these streams
   as input or generate these streams as output.  The client uses SIP
   and SDP to establish an MRCPv2 control channel with the server to use
   its media processing resources.  MRCPv2 servers are addressed using
   SIP URIs.

   The session management protocol (SIP) uses SDP with the offer/answer
   model described in RFC3264 [RFC3264] to set up the MRCPv2 control
   channels and describe their characteristics.  A separate MRCPv2
   session is needed to control each of the media processing resources
   associated with the SIP dialog between the client and server.  Within
   a SIP dialog, the individual resource control channels for the
   different resources are added or removed through SDP offer/answer
   carried in a SIP re-INVITE transaction.

   The server, through the SDP exchange, provides the client with an
   unambiguous channel identifier and a TCP port number.  The client MAY
   then open a new TCP connection with the server on this port number.
   Multiple MRCPv2 channels can share a TCP connection between the
   client and the server.  All MRCPv2 messages exchanged between the
   client and the server carry the specified channel identifier that the
   server MUST ensure is unambiguous among all MRCPv2 control channels
   that are active on that server.  The client uses this channel
   identifier to indicate the media processing resource associated with
   that channel.  For information on message framing, see Section 5.

   The session management protocol (SIP) also establishes the media

   sessions between the client (or other source/sink of media) and the
   MRCPv2 server using SDP m-lines.  One or more media processing
   resources may share a media session under a SIP session, or each
   media processing resource may have its own media session.

   The following diagram shows the general architecture of a system that
   uses MRCPv2.  To simplify the diagram only a few resources are shown.

3.1.  MRCPv2 Media Resource Types

   An MRCPv2 server may offer one or more of the following media
   processing resources to its clients.
   Basic Synthesizer
                  A speech synthesizer resource with very limited
                  capabilities, that can generate its media stream
                  exclusively from concatenated audio clips.  The speech
                  data is described using a limited subset of SSML
                  [W3C.REC-speech-synthesis-20040907] elements.  A basic
                  synthesizer MUST support the SSML tags <speak>,
                  <audio>, <say-as> and <mark>.

   Speech Synthesizer
                  A full capability speech synthesis resource capable of
                  rendering speech from text.  Such a synthesizer MUST
                  have full SSML [W3C.REC-speech-synthesis-20040907]
                  support.
   Recorder
                  A resource capable of recording audio and providing a
                  URI pointer to the recording.  A recorder MUST provide
                  some endpointing capabilities for suppressing silence
                  at the beginning and end of a recording, and MAY also
                  suppress silence in the middle of a recording.  If
                  such suppression is done, the recorder MUST maintain
                  timing metadata to indicate the actual time stamps of
                  the recorded media.
   DTMF Recognizer
                  A recognition resource capable of extracting and
                  interpreting DTMF digits in a media stream and
                  matching them against a supplied digit grammar It
                  could also do a semantic interpretation based on
                  semantic tags in the grammar.
   Speech Recognizer
                  A full speech recognition resource that is capable of
                  receiving a media stream containing audio and
                  interpreting it to recognition results.  It also has a
                  natural language semantic interpreter to post-process
                  the recognized data according to the semantic data in
                  the grammar and provide semantic results along with
                  the recognized input.  The recognizer may also support
                  enrolled grammars, where the client can enroll and
                  create new personal grammars for use in future
                  recognition operations.
   Speaker Verifier
                  A resource capable of verifying the authenticity of a
                  claimed identity by matching a media stream containing
                  spoken input to a pre-existing voiceprint.  This may
                  also involve matching the caller's voice against more
                  than one voiceprint, also called multi-verification or
                  speaker identification.

3.2.  Server and Resource Addressing

   The MRCPv2 server is a generic SIP server, and is thus addressed by a
   SIP URI.

   For example:

        sip:mrcpv2@example.net

4.  MRCPv2 Protocol Basics

   MRCPv2 requires a connection-oriented transport layer protocol such
   as TCP or SCTP to guarantee reliable sequencing and delivery of
   MRCPv2 control messages between the client and the server.  In order
   to meet the requirements for security enumerated in SpeechSC
   Requirements [RFC4313], clients and servers MUST implement TLS as
   well.  One or more connections between the client and the server can
   be shared among different MRCPv2 channels to the server.  The
   individual messages carry the channel identifier to differentiate
   messages on different channels.  MRCPv2 protocol encoding is text
   based with mechanisms to carry embedded binary data.  This allows
   arbitrary data like recognition grammars, recognition results,
   synthesizer speech markup etc. to be carried in MRCPv2 messages.  For
   information on message framing, see Section 5.

4.1.  Connecting to the Server

   MRCPv2 employs a session establishment and management protocol such
   as SIP in conjunction with SDP.  The client reaches an MRCPv2 server
   using conventional INVITE and other SIP requests for establishing,
   maintaining, and terminating SIP dialogs.  The SDP offer/answer
   exchange model over SIP is used to establish a resource control
   channel for each resource.  The SDP offer/answer exchange is also
   used to establish media sessions between the server and the source or
   sink of audio.

4.2.  Managing Resource Control Channels

   The client needs a separate MRCPv2 resource control channel to
   control each media processing resource under the SIP dialog.  A
   unique channel identifier string identifies these resource control
   channels.  The channel identifier is an unambiguous, opaque string
   followed by an "@", then by a string token specifying the type of
   resource.  The server generates the channel identifier and MUST make
   sure it does not clash with the identifier of any other MRCP channel
   currently allocated by that server.  MRCPv2 defines the following
   IANA-registered types of media processing resources.  Additional
   resource types, their associated methods/events and state machines
   may be added as described below in Section 13.

                              Resource Types

   The SIP INVITE or re-INVITE transaction and the SDP offer/answer
   exchange it carries contain m-lines describing the resource control
   channel to be allocated.  There MUST be one SDP m-line for each
   MRCPv2 resource to be used in the session.  This m-line MUST have a
   media type field of "application" and a transport type field of
   either "TCP/MRCPv2" or "TCP/TLS/MRCPv2".  (The usage of SCTP with
   MRCPv2 may be addressed in a future specification).  The port number
   field of the m-line MUST contain the "discard" port of the transport
   protocol (port 9 for TCP) in the SDP offer from the client and MUST
   contain the TCP listen port on the server in the SDP answer.  The
   client may then either set up a TCP or TLS connection to that server
   port or share an already established connection to that port.  Since
   MRCPv2 allows multiple sessions to share the same TCP connection,
   multiple m-lines in a single SDP document may share the same port
   field value; MRCPv2 servers MUST NOT assume any relationship between
   resources using the same port other than the sharing of the
   communication channel.

   MRCPv2 resources do not use the port or format field of the m-line to
   distinguish themselves from other resources using the same channel.
   The client MUST specify the resource type identifier in the resource
   attribute associated with the control m-line of the SDP offer.  The
   server MUST respond with the full Channel-Identifier (which includes
   the resource type identifier and an unambiguous string) in the
   "channel" attribute associated with the control m-line of the SDP
   answer.  To remain backwards compatible with conventional SDP usage,
   the format field of the m-line MUST have the arbitrarily-selected
   value of "1".

   When the client wants to add a media processing resource to the
   session, it issues a SIP re-INVITE transaction.  The SDP offer/answer
   exchange carried by this SIP transaction contains one or more
   additional control m-lines for the new resources to be allocated to
   the session.  The server, on seeing the new m-line, allocates the
   resources (if they are available) and responds with a corresponding



Shanmugham & Burnett    Expires February 12, 2010              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                   MRCPv2                      August 2009


   control m-line in the SDP answer carried in the SIP response.  If the
   new resources are not available, existing media processing going on
   before the RE-INVITE will continue as it was before.

   The a=setup attribute, as described in RFC4145 [RFC4145], MUST be
   "active" for the offer from the client and MUST be "passive" for the
   answer from the MRCPv2 server.  The a=connection attribute MUST have
   a value of "new" on the very first control m-line offer from the
   client to an MRCPv2 server.  Subsequent control m-line offers from
   the client to the MRCP server MAY contain "new" or "existing",
   depending on whether the client wants to set up a new connection or
   share an existing connection, respectively.  If the client specifies
   a value of "new", the server MUST respond with a value of "new".  If
   the client specifies a value of "existing", the server MAY respond
   with a value of "existing" if it prefers to share an existing
   connection or can answer with a value of "new", in which case the
   client MUST initiate a new transport connection.

   When the client wants to de-allocate the resource from this session,
   it issues a SIP re-INVITE transaction with the server.  The SDP MUST
   offer the control m-line with port 0.  The server MUST then answer
   the control m-line with a response of port 0.  This de-allocates the
   associated MRCPv2 identifier and resource.  The server MUST NOT close
   the TCP, SCTP or TLS connection if it is currently being shared among
   multiple MRCP channels.  When all MRCP channels that may be sharing
   the connection are released and/or the associated SIP dialog is
   terminated, the client or server terminates the connection.

   All servers MUST support TLS.  Servers MAY support TCP without TLS in
   physically secure environments.  It is up to the client, through the
   SDP offer, to choose which transport it wants to use for an MRCPv2
   session.  Aside from the exceptions given above, when using TCP the
   m-lines MUST conform to RFC4145 [RFC4145], which describes the usage
   of SDP for connection-oriented transport.  When using TLS the SDP
   m-line for the control pipe MUST conform to comedia over TLS
   [RFC4572], which specifies the usage of SDP for establishing a secure
   connection-oriented transport over TLS.

   This first example shows the power of using SIP to route to the
   appropriate resource.  In the example, note the use of a request to a
   domain's speech server service in the INVITE to
   mresources@example.com.  The SIP routing machinery in the domain
   locates the actual server, mresources@server.example.com, which gets
   returned in the 200 OK.  Note that "cmid" is defined in Section 4.3.

   This example exchange adds a resource control channel for a
   synthesizer.  Since a synthesizer also generates an audio stream,
   this interaction also creates a receive-only RTP media session for

4.3.  Media Streams and RTP Ports

   Since MRCPv2 resources either generate or consume media streams, the
   client or the server needs to associate media sessions with their
   corresponding resource or resources.  More than one resource could be
   associated with a single media session or each resource could be
   assigned a separate media session.  Also note that more than one
   media session can be associated with a single resource if need be,
   but this scenario is not useful for the current set of resources.
   For example, a synthesizer and a recognizer could be associated to
   the same media session (m=audio line), if it is opened in "sendrecv"
   mode.  Alternatively, the recognizer could have its own "sendonly"
   audio session and the synthesizer could have its own "recvonly" audio
   session.

Internet-Draft                   MRCPv2                      August 2009


   The association between control channels and their corresponding
   media sessions is established using a new "resource channel media
   identifier" media-level attribute ("cmid").  Valid values of this
   attribute are the values of the "mid" attribute defined in RFC3388
   [RFC3388].  If there is more than 1 audio m-line, then each audio
   m-line MUST have a "mid" attribute.  Each control m-line MAY have one
   or more "cmid" attributes that match the resource control channel to
   the "mid" attributes of the audio m-lines it is associated with.
   Note that if a control m-line does not have a "cmid" attribute it
   will not be associated with any media.  The operations on such a
   resource will hence be limited.  For example, if it was a recognizer
   resource, the RECOGNIZE method requires an associated media to
   process while the INTERPRET method does not.  The formatting of the
   "cmid" attribute is described by the following ABNF:

   cmid-attribute = "a=cmid:" identification-tag
   identification-tag = token

   To allow this flexible mapping of media sessions to MRCPv2 control
   channels, a single audio m-line can be associated with multiple
   resources or each resource can have its own audio m-line.  For
   example, if the client wants to allocate a recognizer and a
   synthesizer and associate them with a single 2-way audio pipe, the
   SDP offer would contain two control m-lines and a single audio m-line
   with an attribute of "sendrecv".  Each of the control m-lines would
   have a "cmid" attribute whose value matches the "mid" of the audio
   m-line.  If, on the other hand, the client wants to allocate a
   recognizer and a synthesizer each with its own separate audio pipe,
   the SDP offer would carry two control m-lines (one for the recognizer
   and another for the synthesizer) and two audio m-lines (one with the
   attribute "sendonly" and another with attribute "recvonly").  The
   "cmid" attribute of the recognizer control m-line would match the
   "mid" value of the "sendonly" audio m-line and the "cmid" attribute
   of the synthesizer control m-line would match the "mid" attribute of
   the "recvonly" m-line.

   When a server receives media (e.g. audio) on a media session that is
   associated with more than one media processing resource, it is the
   responsibility of the server to receive and fork the media to the
   resources that need to consume it.  If multiple resources in an
   MRCPv2 session are generating audio (or other media) to be sent on a
   single associated media session, it is the responsibility of the
   server to either multiplex the multiple streams onto the single RTP
   session or contain an embedded RTP mixer (see RFC3550 [RFC3550]) to
   combine the multiple streams into one.  In the former case, the media
   stream will contain RTP packets generated by different sources, and
   hence the packets will have different Synchronization Source
   identifiers (SSRCs).  In the latter case, the RTP packets will

Internet-Draft                   MRCPv2                      August 2009


   contain multiple (CSRCs) corresponding to the original streams before
   being combined by the mixer.  An MRCPv2 implementation MUST either
   multiplex or mix unless it cannot correctly do either, in which case
   the server MUST disallow the client from associating multiple such
   resources to a single audio pipe by rejecting the SDP offer with a
   SIP 501 "Not Implemented" error.

4.4.  MRCPv2 Message Transport

   The MRCPv2 messages defined in this document are transported over a
   TCP, TLS or SCTP (in the future) connection between the client and
   the server.  The method for setting up this transport connection and
   the resource control channel is discussed in Section 4.1 and
   Section 4.2.  Multiple resource control channels between a client and
   a server that belong to different SIP dialogs can share one or more
   TLS, TCP or SCTP connections between them; the server and client MUST
   support this mode of operation.  The individual MRCPv2 messages carry
   the MRCPv2 channel identifier in their Channel-Identifier header,
   which MUST be used to differentiate MRCPv2 messages from different
   resource channels (see Section 6.2.1 for details).  All MRCPv2
   servers MUST support TLS.  Servers MAY support TCP without TLS in
   physically secure environments.  It is up to the client to choose
   which mode of transport it wants to use for an MRCPv2 session.

   Most examples from here on show only the MRCPv2 messages and do not
   show the SIP messages and headers that may have been used to
   establish the MRCPv2 control channel.


5.  MRCPv2 Specification

   MRCPv2 messages are textual using the ISO 10646 character set in the
   UTF-8 encoding (RFC3629 [RFC3629]) to allow many different languages
   to be represented.  However, to assist in compact representations,
   MRCPv2 also allows message bodies to be represented in other
   character sets such as ISO 8859-1.  This may be useful for languages
   such as Chinese where the default character set for most documents is
   not UTF-8.  The MRCPv2 protocol headers (the first line of an MRCP
   message) and header names use only the US-ASCII subset of UTF-8.
   Internationalization only applies to certain fields like grammar,
   results, speech markup etc, and not to MRCPv2 as a whole.

   Lines are terminated by CRLF.  Also, some parameters in the message
   may contain binary data or a record spanning multiple lines.  Such
   fields have a length value associated with the parameter, which
   indicates the number of octets immediately following the parameter.

5.1.  Common Protocol Elements

   The MRCPv2 message set consists of requests from the client to the
   server, responses from the server to the client and asynchronous
   events from the server to the client.  All these messages consist of
   a start-line, one or more headers, an empty line (i.e. a line with
   nothing preceding the CRLF) indicating the end of the header fields,
   and an optional message body.

   generic-message  =    start-line
                         message-header
                         CRLF
                         [ message-body ]

   start-line       =    request-line / response-line / event-line

   message-header   =    1*(generic-header / resource-header)

   resource-header  =    recognizer-header
                    /    synthesizer-header
                    /    recorder-header
                    /    verifier-header


   The message-body contains resource-specific and message-specific
   data.  The actual Media Types used to carry the data are specified
   later in the sections defining the individual messages.  Generic
   headers are described in Section 6.2.

   If a message contains a message body, the message MUST contain
   content-headers indicating the Media Type and encoding of the data in
   the message body.

   Request, response and event messages (described in following
   sections) include the version of MRCP that the message conforms to.
   Version compatibility rules follow [H3.1] regarding version ordering,
   compliance requirements, and upgrading of version numbers.  The
   version information is indicated by "MRCP" (as opposed to "HTTP" in
   [H3.1]) or "MRCP/2.0" (as opposed to "HTTP/1.1" in [H3.1]).  To be
   compliant with this specification, clients and servers sending MRCPv2
   messages MUST indicate an mrcp-version of "MRCP/2.0".

   mrcp-version   =    "MRCP" "/" 1*2DIGIT "." 1*2DIGIT

   The message-length field specifies the length of the message in
   bytes, including the start-line, and MUST be the 2nd token from the
   beginning of the message.  This is to make the framing and parsing of
   the message simpler to do.  This field specifies the length of the

   message including data that may be encoded into the body of the
   message.  Note that this value MAY be printed as a fixed-length
   integer that is zero-padded in front in order to eliminate or reduce
   inefficiency in cases where the message-length value would change as
   a result of the length of the message-length token itself.

   message-length =    1*19DIGIT

   All MRCPv2 messages, responses and events MUST carry the Channel-
   Identifier header so the server or client can differentiate messages
   from different control channels that may share the same transport
   connection.

   In the resource-specific header descriptions in sections 8-11, a
   header is disallowed on a method (request, response, or event) for
   that resource unless specifically listed as being allowed.  Also, the
   phrasing "This header MAY occur on method X" indicates that the
   header is allowed on that method but is not required to be used in
   every instance of that method.

5.2.  Request

   An MRCPv2 request consists of a Request line followed by message
   headers and an optional message body containing data specific to the
   request message.

   The Request message from a client to the server includes within the
   first line the method to be applied, a method tag for that request
   and the version of the protocol in use.

   request-line   =    mrcp-version SP message-length SP method-name
                       SP request-id CRLF

   The mrcp-version field is the MRCP protocol version that is being
   used by the client.

   The message-length field specifies the length of the message,
   including the start-line.

   Details about the mrcp-version and message-length fields are given in
   Section 5.1.

   The method-name field identifies the specific request that the client
   is making to the server.  Each resource supports a subset of the
   MRCPv2 methods.  The subset for each resource is defined in the
   section of the specification for the corresponding resource.

   method-name    =    generic-method
                  /    synthesizer-method
                  /    recorder-method
                  /    recognizer-method
                  /    verifier-method

   The request-id field is a unique identifier representable as an
   unsigned 32 bit integer created by the client and sent to the server.
   Consecutive requests within an MRCP session MUST utilize
   monotonically increasing request-id's.  The request-id space is
   linear, (i.e. not mod(32)) so the space does not wrap and validity
   can be checked with a simple unsigned comparison operation.  The
   client may choose any initial value for its first request, but a
   small integer is RECOMMENDED to avoid exhausting the space in long
   sessions.  If the server receives duplicate or out-of-order requests
   the server MUST reject the request with a response code of 410.
   Since request-id's are scoped to the MRCP session, they are unique
   across all TCP connections and all resource channels in the session.

   The server resource MUST use the client-assigned identifier in its
   response to the request.  If the request does not complete
   synchronously, future asynchronous events associated with this
   request MUST carry the client-assigned request-id.

   request-id     =    1*10DIGIT

5.3.  Response

   After receiving and interpreting the request message for a method,
   the server resource responds with an MRCPv2 response message.  The
   response consists of a response line followed by message headers and
   an optional message body containing data specific to the method.

   response-line  =    mrcp-version SP message-length SP request-id
                                    SP status-code SP request-state CRLF

   The mrcp-version field MUST contain the version of the request if
   supported; otherwise, it must contain the highest version of the
   MRCPv2 protocol supported by the server.

   The message-length field specifies the length of the message,
   including the start-line.

   Details about the mrcp-version and message-length fields are given in
   Section 5.1.

   The request-id used in the response MUST match the one sent in the
   corresponding request message.

   The status-code field is a 3-digit code representing the success or
   failure or other status of the request.

   The request-state field indicates if the action initiated by the
   Request is PENDING, IN-PROGRESS or COMPLETE.  The COMPLETE status
   means that the Request was processed to completion and that there
   will be no more events or other messages from that resource to the
   client with that request-id.  The PENDING status means that the
   request has been placed on a queue and will be processed in first-in-
   first-out order.  The IN-PROGRESS status means that the request is
   being processed and is not yet complete.  A PENDING or IN-PROGRESS
   status indicates that further Event messages may be delivered with
   that request-id.

   request-state    =  "COMPLETE"
                    /  "IN-PROGRESS"
                    /  "PENDING"

5.4.  Status Codes

   The status codes are classified under the Success (2XX) codes, Client
   Failure (4XX) codes, and Server Failure (5XX).

5.5.  Events

   The server resource may need to communicate a change in state or the
   occurrence of a certain event to the client.  These messages are used
   when a request does not complete immediately and the response returns
   a status of PENDING or IN-PROGRESS.  The intermediate results and

   events of the request are indicated to the client through the event
   message from the server.  The event message consists of an event
   header line followed by message headers and an optional message body
   containing data specific to the event message.  The header line has
   the request-id of the corresponding request and status value.  The
   request-state value is COMPLETE if the request is done and this was
   the last event, else it is IN-PROGRESS.

   event-line       =  mrcp-version SP message-length SP event-name
                                    SP request-id SP request-state CRLF

   The mrcp-version used here is identical to the one used in the
   Request/Response Line and indicates the version of the MRCPv2
   protocol running on the server.

   The message-length field specifies the length of the message,
   including the start-line.

   Details about the mrcp-version and message-length fields are given in
   Section 5.1.

   The event-name identifies the nature of the event generated by the
   media resource.  The set of valid event names depends on the resource
   generating it.  See the corresponding resource-specific section of
   the document.

   event-name       =  synthesizer-event

                    /  recorder-event
                    /  verifier-event

   The request-id used in the event MUST match the one sent in the
   request that caused this event.

   The request-state indicates whether the Request/Command causing this
   event is complete or still in progress, and is the same as the one
   mentioned in Section 5.3.  The final event for a request has a
   COMPLETE status indicating the completion of the request.


6.  MRCPv2 Generic Methods, Headers, and Result Structure

   MRCPv2 supports a set of methods and headers that are common to all
   resources.  These are discussed here; resource-specific methods and
   headers are discussed in the corresponding resource-specific section
   of the document.

6.1.  Generic Methods

   MRCPv2 supports two generic methods for reading and writing the state
   associated with a resource.

   generic-method      =    "SET-PARAMS"
                       /    "GET-PARAMS"

   These are described in the following sub-sections.

6.1.1.  SET-PARAMS

   The "SET-PARAMS" method, from the client to the server, tells the
   MRCPv2 resource to define parameters for the session, such as voice
   characteristics and prosody on synthesizers, recognition timers on
   recognizers, etc.  If the server accepts and sets all parameters it
   MUST return a Response-Status of 200.  If it chooses to ignore some
   optional headers that can be safely ignored without affecting
   operation of the server it MUST return 201.

   If one or more of the headers being sent is incorrect, error 403,
   404, or 409 MUST be returned as follows:
   o  If one or more of the headers being set has an illegal value, the
      server MUST reject the request with a 404 Illegal Value for
      Header.
   o  If one or more of the headers being set is unsupported for the
      resource, the server MUST reject the request with a 403
      Unsupported Header, except as described in the next paragraph.
   o  If one or more of the headers being set has an unsupported value,
      the server MUST reject the request with a 409 Unsupported Header
      Value, except as described in the next paragraph.

   If both error 404 and another error have occurred, only error 404
   MUST be returned.  If both errors 403 and 409 have occurred, but not
   error 404, only error 403 MUST be returned.

   If error 403, 404, or 409 is returned, the response MUST include the
   bad or unsupported headers and their values exactly as they were sent
   from the client.  Session parameters modified using "SET-PARAMS" do
   not override parameters explicitly specified on individual requests
   or requests that are in-PROGRESS.

6.1.2.  GET-PARAMS

   The "GET-PARAMS" method, from the client to the server, asks the
   MRCPv2 resource for its current session parameters, such as voice
   characteristics and prosody on synthesizers, recognition-timer on
   recognizers, etc.  For every empty header field the client sends in
   the request, the server MUST include the corresponding headers and
   their values in the response.  If no parameter headers are specified
   by the client then the server MUST return all the settable parameters
   and their values in the corresponding headers of the response,
   including vendor-specific parameters.  Such wild-card parameter
   requests can be very processing-intensive, since the number of
   settable parameters can be large depending on the implementation.
   Hence, it is RECOMMENDED that the client not use the wildcard
   "GET-PARAMS" operation very often.  Note that "GET-PARAMS" returns
   header values that apply to the whole session and not values that
   have a request level scope.

   If all of the headers requested are supported, the server MUST return
   a Response-Status of 200.  If some of the headers being retrieved are
   unsupported for the resource, the server MUST reject the request with
   a 403 Unsupported Header.  Such a response MUST include the (empty)
   unsupported headers exactly as they were sent from the client.

6.2.  Generic Message Headers

   All MRCPv2 headers, which include both the generic-headers defined in
   the following sub-sections and the resource-specific headers defined
   later, follow the same generic format as that given in Section 3.1 of
   RFC5322 [RFC5322].  Each header consists of a name followed by a
   colon (":") and the value.  Header names are case-insensitive.  The
   value MAY be preceded by any amount of LWS, though a single SP is



Shanmugham & Burnett    Expires February 12, 2010              [Page 31]

   preferred.  Headers may extend over multiple lines by preceding each
   extra line with at least one SP or HT.

   message-header = field-name ":" [ field-value ]
   field-name     = token
   field-value    = *LWS field-content *( CRLF 1*LWS field-content)
   field-content  = <the OCTETs making up the field-value
                       and consisting of either *TEXT or combinations
                       of token, separators, and quoted-string>

   The field-content does not include any leading or trailing LWS (i.e.
   linear white space occurring before the first non-whitespace
   character of the field-value or after the last non-whitespace
   character of the field-value).  Such leading or trailing LWS MAY be
   removed without changing the semantics of the field value.  Any LWS
   that occurs between field-content MAY be replaced with a single SP
   before interpreting the field value or forwarding the message
   downstream.

   MRCPv2 servers and clients MUST NOT depend on header order.  It is
   "good practice" to send general-header fields first, followed by
   request-header or response-header fields, and ending with the entity-
   header fields.  However, MRCPv2 servers and clients MUST be prepared
   to process the headers in any order.  The only exception to this rule
   is when there are multiple headers with the same header name in a
   message.

   Multiple headers with the same name MAY be present in a message if
   and only if the entire value for that header is defined as a comma-
   separated list [i.e., #(values)].

   Since vendor-specific parameters may be order-dependent, it MUST be
   possible to combine multiple headers of the same name into one
   "header:value" pair without changing the semantics of the message, by
   appending each subsequent value to the first, each separated by a
   comma.  The order in which headers with the same name are received is
   therefore significant to the interpretation of the combined header
   value, and thus an intermediary MUST NOT change the order of these
   values when a message is forwarded.

6.2.1.  Channel-Identifier

   All MRCPv2 requests, responses and events MUST contain the Channel-
   Identifier header.  The value is allocated by the server when a
   control channel is added to the session and communicated to the
   client by the "a=channel" attribute in the SDP answer from the
   server.  The header value consists of 2 parts separated by the '@'
   symbol.  The first part is an unambiguous string identifying the
   MRCPv2 session.  The second part is a string token which specifies
   one of the media processing resource types listed in Section 3.1.
   The unambiguous string (first part) MUST BE unique among the resource
   instances managed by the server and is common to all resource
   channels with that server established through a single SIP dialog.

   channel-identifier  = "Channel-Identifier" ":" channel-id CRLF
   channel-id          = 1*alphanum "@" 1*alphanum


6.2.2.  Accept

   The Accept header field follows the syntax defined in [H14.1].  The
   semantics are also identical, with the exception that if no Accept
   header field is present, the server MUST assume a default value that
   is specific to the resource type that is being controlled.  This
   default value can be changed for a resource on a session by sending
   this header in a SET-PARAMS method.  The current default value of
   this header for a resource in a session can be found through a GET-
   PARAMS method.  This header MAY occur on any request.

6.2.3.  Active-Request-Id-List

   In a request, this header indicates the list of request-ids to which
   the request applies.  This is useful when there are multiple requests
   that are PENDING or IN-PROGRESS and the client wants this request to
   apply to one or more of these specifically.

   In a response, this header returns the list of request-ids that the
   method modified or affected.  There could be one or more requests in
   a request-state of PENDING or IN-PROGRESS.  When a method affecting
   one or more PENDING or IN-PROGRESS requests is sent from the client
   to the server, the response MUST contain the list of request-ids that
   were affected or modified by this command in its header.

   The active-request-id-list is only used in requests and responses,
   not in events.

   For example, if a "STOP" request with no active-request-id-list is
   sent to a synthesizer resource which has one or more "SPEAK" requests
   in the PENDING or IN-PROGRESS state, all "SPEAK" requests MUST be
   cancelled, including the one IN-PROGRESS.  The response to the "STOP"
   request contains in the active-request-id-list the request-ids of all
   the "SPEAK" requests that were terminated.  After sending the STOP
   response, the server MUST NOT send any SPEAK-COMPLETE or RECOGNITION-
   COMPLETE events for the terminated requests.

   active-request-id-list  =  "Active-Request-Id-List" ":"
                              request-id *("," request-id) CRLF

6.2.4.  Proxy-Sync-Id

   When any server resource generates a barge-in-able event, it also
   generates a unique tag.  The tag is sent as this header's value in an
   event to the client.  The client then acts as a intermediary among
   the server resources and sends a BARGE-IN-OCCURRED method to the
   synthesizer server resource with the Proxy-Sync-Id it received from
   the server resource.  When the recognizer and synthesizer resources
   are part of the same session, they may choose to work together to
   achieve quicker interaction and response.  Here the proxy-sync-id
   helps the resource receiving the event, intermediated by the client,
   to decide if this event has been processed through a direct
   interaction of the resources.  This header MAY occur only on events
   and the BARGE-IN-OCCURRED method.

   proxy-sync-id    =  "Proxy-Sync-Id" ":" 1*VCHAR CRLF

6.2.5.  Accept-Charset

   See [H14.2].  This specifies the acceptable character sets for
   entities returned in the response or events associated with this
   request.  This is useful in specifying the character set to use in
   the NLSML results of a "RECOGNITION-COMPLETE" event.  This header is
   only used on requests.

6.2.6.  Content-Type

   See [H14.17].  MRCPv2 supports a restricted set of registered Media
   Types for content, including speech markup, grammar, and recognition
   results.  The content types applicable to each MRCPv2 resource-type
   are specified in the corresponding section of the document.  The
   multi-part content type "multi-part/mixed" is supported to
   communicate multiple of the above mentioned contents, in which case
   the body parts MUST NOT contain any MRCPv2 specific headers.  This
   header MAY occur on all messages.

6.2.7.  Content-ID

   This header contains an ID or name for the content by which it can be
   referenced.  This header operates according to the specification in
   RFC2392 [RFC2392] and is required for content disambiguation in
   multi-part messages.  In MRCPv2 whenever the associated content is
   stored, by either the client or the server, it MUST be retrievable
   using this ID.  Such content can be referenced later in a session by
   addressing it with the "session:" URI scheme described in
   Section 13.6.  This header MAY occur on all messages.

6.2.8.  Content-Base

   The content-base entity-header may be used to specify the base URI
   for resolving relative URLs within the entity.

   content-base      = "Content-Base" ":" absoluteURI CRLF

   Note, however, that the base URI of the contents within the entity-
   body may be redefined within that entity-body.  An example of this
   would be multi-part media, which in turn can have multiple entities
   within it.  This header MAY occur on all messages.

6.2.9.  Content-Encoding

   The content-encoding entity-header is used as a modifier to the
   media-type.  When present, its value indicates what additional
   content encoding has been applied to the entity-body, and thus what
   decoding mechanisms must be applied in order to obtain the media-type

   referenced by the content-type header.  Content-encoding is primarily
   used to allow a document to be compressed without losing the identity
   of its underlying media type.  Note that the SDP session can be used
   to determine accepted encodings (see Section 7).  This header MAY
   occur on all messages.

   content-encoding  = "Content-Encoding" ":"
                       *WSP content-coding
                       *(*WSP "," *WSP content-coding *WSP )
                       CRLF


   Content-coding is defined in [H3.5].  An example of its use is
   Content-Encoding:gzip

   If multiple encodings have been applied to an entity, the content
   encodings MUST be listed in the order in which they were applied.

6.2.10.  Content-Location

   The content-location entity-header MAY be used to supply the resource
   location for the entity enclosed in the message when that entity is
   accessible from a location separate from the requested resource's
   URI.  Refer to [H14.14].

   content-location  =  "Content-Location" ":"
                        ( absoluteURI / relativeURI ) CRLF


   The content-location value is a statement of the location of the
   resource corresponding to this particular entity at the time of the
   request.  This header is provided for optimization purposes only.
   The receiver of this header MAY assume that the entity being sent is
   identical to what would have been retrieved or might already have
   been retrieved from the content-location URI.

   For example, if the client provided a grammar markup inline, and it
   had previously retrieved it from a certain URI, that URI can be
   provided as part of the entity, using the content-location header.
   This allows a resource like the recognizer to look into its cache to
   see if this grammar was previously retrieved, compiled and cached.
   In this case, it might optimize by using the previously compiled
   grammar object.

   If the content-location is a relative URI, the relative URI is
   interpreted relative to the content-base URI.  This header MAY occur
   on all messages.

6.2.11.  Content-Length

   This header contains the length of the content of the message body
   (i.e. after the double CRLF following the last header field).  Unlike
   HTTP, it MUST be included in all messages that carry content beyond
   the header portion of the message.  If it is missing, a default value
   of zero is assumed.  Otherwise, it is interpreted according to
   [H14.13].  When a message having no use for a message body contains
   one, i.e. the Content-Length is non-zero, the receiver MUST ignore
   the content of the message body.  This header MAY occur on all
   messages.

6.2.12.  Fetch Timeout

   When the recognizer or synthesizer needs to fetch documents or other
   resources this header controls the corresponding URI access
   properties.  This defines the timeout for content that the server may
   need to fetch over the network.  The value is interpreted to be in
   milliseconds and ranges from 0 to an implementation-specific maximum
   value.  The default value for this header is implementation-specific.
   This header MAY occur in "DEFINE-GRAMMAR", "RECOGNIZE", "SPEAK",
   "SET-PARAMS" or "GET-PARAMS".

   fetch-timeout       =   "Fetch-Timeout" ":" 1*19DIGIT CRLF

6.2.13.  Cache-Control

   If the server implements content caching, it MUST adhere to the cache
   correctness rules of HTTP 1.1 [RFC2616] when accessing and caching
   stored content.  In particular, the "expires" and "cache-control"
   headers of the cached URI or document MUST be honored and take
   precedence over the Cache-Control defaults set by this header.  The
   cache-control directives are used to define the default caching
   algorithms on the server for the session or request.  The scope of
   the directive is based on the method it is sent on.  If the
   directives are sent on a "SET-PARAMS" method, it applies for all
   requests for external documents the server makes during that session,
   unless overridden by a cache-control header on an individual request.
   If the directives are sent on any other requests they apply only to
   external document requests the server makes for that request.  An
   empty cache-control header on the "GET-PARAMS" method is a request
   for the server to return the current cache-control directives setting
   on the server.  This header MAY occur only on requests.

   delta-seconds       = 1*19DIGIT


   Here delta-seconds is a decimal time value specifying the number of
   seconds since the instant the message response or data was received
   by the server.

   The cache-directives allow the client to ask the server to override
   the default cache expiration mechanisms.
   max-age        Indicates that the client can tolerate the server
                  using content whose age is no greater than the
                  specified time in seconds.  Unless a max-stale
                  directive is also included, the client is not willing
                  to accept a response based on stale data.
   min-fresh      Indicates that the client is willing to accept a
                  server response with cached data whose expiration is
                  no less than its current age plus the specified time
                  in seconds.  If the server's cache time to live
                  exceeds the client-supplied min-fresh value, the
                  server MUST NOT utilize cached content.
   max-stale      Indicates that the client is willing to allow a server
                  to utilize cached data that has exceeded its
                  expiration time.  If max-stale is assigned a value,
                  then the client is willing to allow the server to use
                  cached data that has exceeded its expiration time by
                  no more than the specified number of seconds.  If no
                  value is assigned to max-stale, then the client is
                  willing to allow the server to use stale data of any
                  age.

   The server cache MAY be requested to use stale response/data without
   validation, but only if this does not conflict with any "MUST"-level
   requirements concerning cache validation (e.g., a "must-revalidate"
   cache-control directive in the HTTP 1.1 specification pertaining to
   the corresponding URI).

   If both the MRCPv2 cache-control directive and the cached entry on
   the server include "max-age" directives, then the lesser of the two
   values is used for determining the freshness of the cached entry for
   that request.

6.2.14.  Logging-Tag

   This header MAY be sent as part of a "SET-PARAMS"/"GET-PARAMS" method
   to set or retrieve the logging tag for logs generated by the server.
   Once set, the value persists until a new value is set or the session
   ends.  The MRCPv2 server MAY provide a mechanism to subset its output
   logs so that system administrators can examine or extract only the
   log file portion during which the logging tag was set to a certain
   value.

   It is RECOMMENDED that clients have some identifying information in
   the logging tag, so that one can determine which client request
   generated a given log message at the server.

   logging-tag    = "Logging-Tag" ":" 1*UTFCHAR CRLF

6.2.15.  Set-Cookie and Set-Cookie2

   Since the associated HTTP client on an MRCPv2 server fetches
   documents for processing on behalf of the MRCPv2 client, the cookie
   store in the HTTP client of the MRCPv2 server is treated as an
   extension of the cookie store in the HTTP client of the MRCPv2
   client.  This requires that the MRCPv2 client and server be able to
   synchronize their common cookie store as needed.  To enable the
   MRCPv2 client to push its stored cookies to the MRCPv2 server and get
   new cookies from the MRCPv2 server stored back to the MRCPv2 client,
   the set-cookie and set-cookie2 entity-header fields MAY be included
   in MRCPv2 requests to update the cookie store on a server and be
   returned in final MRCPv2 responses or events to subsequently update
   the client's own cookie store.  The stored cookies on the server
   persist for the duration of the MRCPv2 session and MUST be destroyed
   at the end of the session.  To ensure support for the type of cookie
   header dictated by the HTTP origin server, MRCPv2 clients and servers
   MUST support both the set-cookie and set-cookie2 entity header
   fields.

   The set-cookie and set-cookie2 headers are specified in RFC2109
   [RFC2109] and RFC2965 [RFC2965], respectively.  The "Age" attribute
   is introduced in this specification to indicate the age of the cookie
   and is optional.  An MRCPv2 client or server MUST calculate the age
   of the cookie according to the age calculation rules in the HTTP/1.1
   specification [RFC2616] and append the "Age" attribute accordingly.

   The MRCPv2 client or server MUST supply defaults for the Domain and
   Path attributes if omitted by the HTTP origin server as specified in
   RFC2109 (set-cookie) and RFC2965 (set-cookie2).  Note that there is
   no leading dot present in the Domain attribute value in this case.
   Although an explicitly specified Domain value received via the HTTP
   protocol may be modified to include a leading dot, an MRCPv2 client
   or server MUST NOT modify the Domain value when received via the
   MRCPv2 protocol.

   An MRCPv2 client or server MAY combine multiple cookie headers of the
   same type into a single "field-name:field-value" pair as described in
   Section 6.2.

   The set-cookie and set-cookie2 headers MAY be specified in any

   request that subsequently results in the server performing an HTTP
   access.  When a server receives new cookie information from an HTTP
   origin server, and assuming the cookie store is modified according
   RFC2109 or RFC2965, the server MUST return the new cookie information
   in the MRCPv2 COMPLETE response or event as appropriate to allow the
   client to update its own cookie store.

   The "SET-PARAMS" request MAY specify the set-cookie and set-cookie2
   headers to update the cookie store on a server.  The GET-PARAMS
   request MAY be used to return the entire cookie store of "Set-Cookie"
   or "Set-Cookie2" type cookies to the client.

6.2.16.  Vendor Specific Parameters

   This set of headers allows for the client to set or retrieve Vendor
   Specific parameters.

   vendor-specific          =    "Vendor-Specific-Parameters" ":"
                                 [vendor-specific-av-pair
                                 *(";" vendor-specific-av-pair)] CRLF

   vendor-specific-av-pair  = vendor-av-pair-name "="
                              value


   Headers of this form MAY be sent in any method (request) and are used
   to manage implementation-specific parameters on the server side.  The
   vendor-av-pair-name follows the reverse Internet Domain Name
   convention (see Section 13.1.6 for syntax and registration
   information).  The value of the vendor attribute is specified after
   the "=" symbol and MAY be quoted.  For example:

   com.example.companyA.paramxyz=256
   com.example.companyA.paramabc=High
   com.example.companyB.paramxyz=Low


   When used in GET-PARAMS to get the current value of these parameters
   from the server, this header value may contain a semicolon-separated
   list of implementation-specific attribute names.

6.3.  Generic Result Structure

   Result data from the server for the Recognizer and Verification
   resources is carried as a typed media entity in the MRCPv2 message
   body of various events.  The Natural Language Semantics Markup
   Language (NLSML), an XML markup based on an early draft from the W3C,
   is the default standard for returning results back to the client.

Internet-Draft                   MRCPv2                      August 2009


   Hence, all servers implementing these resource types MUST support the
   Media Type application/nlsml+xml.  When the Extensible MultiModal
   Annotation [W3C.REC-emma-20090210] specification being developed at
   the W3C has reached a stable standards state, it can be used to
   return results as well.  This can be done by negotiating the format
   at session establishment time with SDP (a=resultformat:application/
   emma+xml) or with SIP (Allow/Accept).  With SIP, for example, if a
   client wants results in EMMA, an MRCPv2 proxy can route the request
   to a server that supports EMMA by inspecting the SIP headers, rather
   than having to introspect in to the SDP.

   MRCPv2 uses this representation to convey content among the clients
   and servers that generate and make use of the markup.  MRCPv2 uses
   NSLML specifically to convey recognition, enrollment, and
   verification results between the corresponding resource on the MRCPv2
   server and the MRCPv2 client.  Details of this result format are
   fully described in Section 6.3.1.

   Content-Type:application/nlsml+xml
   Content-Length:...

                              Result Example

6.3.1.  Natural Language Semantics Markup Language

   The Natural Language Semantics Markup Language (NLSML) is an XML data
   structure with elements and attributes designed to carry result
   information from recognizer (including enrollment) and verification
   resources.  The normative definition of NLSML is the RelaxNG schema
   in Section 16.1.  Note that the elements and attributes of this
   format are defined in the MRCPv2 namespace.  In the result structure,
   they must either be prefixed by a namespace prefix declared within
   the result or must be children of an element identified as belonging
   to the respective namespace.  For details on how to use XML
   Namespaces, see [W3C.REC-xml-names11-20040204].  Section 2 of
   [W3C.REC-xml-names11-20040204] provides details on how to declare

   namespaces and namespace prefixes.

   The root element of NLSML is <result>.  Optional child elements are
   <interpretation>, <enrollment-result>, and <verification-result>, at
   least one of which must be present.  A single <result> may contain
   all of the optional child elements.  Details of the <result> and
   <interpretation> elements and their subelements and attributes can be
   found in Section 9.6.  Details of the <enrollment-result> element and
   its subelements can be found in Section 9.7.  Details of the
   <veriifcation-result> element and its subelements can be found in
   Section 11.5.2.


7.  Resource Discovery

   Server resources may be discovered and their capabilities learned by
   clients through standard SIP machinery.  The client can issue a SIP
   OPTIONS transaction to a server, which has the effect of requesting
   the capabilities of the server.  The server MUST respond to such a
   request with an SDP-encoded description of its capabilities according
   to RFC3264 [RFC3264].  The MRCPv2 capabilities are described by a
   single m-line containing the media type "application" and transport
   type "TCP/TLS/MRCPv2" or "TCP/MRCPv2".  There MUST be one "resource"
   attribute for each media resource that the server supports with the
   resource type identifier as its value.

   The SDP description MUST also contain m-lines describing the audio
   capabilities and the coders the server supports.

   In this example, the client uses the SIP OPTIONS method to query the
   capabilities of the MRCPv2 server.

8.  Speech Synthesizer Resource

   This resource processes text markup provided by the client and
   generates a stream of synthesized speech in real-time.  Depending
   upon the server implementation and capability of this resource, the
   client can also dictate parameters of the synthesized speech such as
   voice characteristics, speaker speed, etc.

   The synthesizer resource is controlled by MRCPv2 requests from the
   client.  Similarly, the resource can respond to these requests or
   generate asynchronous events to the client to indicate conditions of
   interest to the client during the generation of the synthesized
   speech stream.

   This section applies for the following resource types:
      speechsynth
      basicsynth

   The capabilities of these resources are defined in Section 3.1.

8.1.  Synthesizer State Machine

   The synthesizer maintains a state machine to process MRCPv2 requests
   from the client.  The state transitions shown below describe the
   states of the synthesizer and reflect the state of the request at the
   head of the synthesizer resource queue.  A "SPEAK" request in the
   PENDING state can be deleted or stopped by a "STOP" request without
   affecting the state of the resource.

8.4.  Synthesizer Header Fields

   A synthesizer method may contain headers containing request options
   and information to augment the Request, Response or Event it is
   associated with.

   synthesizer-header  =  jump-size
                       /  kill-on-barge-in

                       /  prosody-parameter
                       /  speech-marker
                       /  speech-language
                       /  fetch-hint
                       /  audio-fetch-hint
                       /  failed-uri
                       /  failed-uri-cause

                       /  speak-length
                       /  load-lexicon
                       /  lexicon-search-order


8.4.1.  Jump-Size

   This header MAY be specified in a CONTROL method and controls the
   amount to jump forward or backward in an active "SPEAK" request.  A +
   or - indicates a relative value to what is being currently played.
   This header MAY also be specified in a "SPEAK" request as a desired
   offset into the synthesized speech.  In this case, the synthesizer
   MUST begin speaking from this amount of time into the speech markup.
   Note that an offset that extends beyond the end of the produced
   speech will result in audio of length zero.  The different speech
   length units supported are dependent on the synthesizer
   implementation.  If the synthesizer resource does not support a unit
   or the operation, the resource MUST respond with a status code of 409
   "Unsupported Header Value".

8.4.2.  Kill-On-Barge-In

   This header MAY be sent as part of the "SPEAK" method to enable kill-
   on-barge-in support.  If enabled, the "SPEAK" method is interrupted
   by DTMF input detected by a signal detector resource or by the start
   of speech sensed or recognized by the speech recognizer resource.

   kill-on-barge-in      =   "Kill-On-Barge-In" ":" BOOLEAN CRLF


   The client MUST send a BARGE-IN-OCCURRED method to the synthesizer
   resource when it receives a barge-in-able event from any source.
   This source could be a synthesizer resource or signal detector
   resource and MAY be either local or distributed.  If this header is
   not specified in a "SPEAK" request or explicitly set by a
   "SET-PARAMS", the default value for this header is "true".

   If the recognizer or signal detector resource is on the same server
   as the synthesizer and both are part of the same session, the server
   MAY work with both to provide internal notification to the
   synthesizer so that audio may be stopped without having to wait for
   the client's BARGE-IN-OCCURRED event.

8.4.3.  Speaker Profile

   This header MAY be part of the "SET-PARAMS"/"GET-PARAMS" or "SPEAK"
   request from the client to the server and specifies a URI which
   references the profile of the speaker.  Speaker profiles are
   collections of voice parameters like gender, accent etc.

                Synthesizer Resource Compleion Cause Codes

8.4.5.  Completion Reason

   This header MAY be specified in a "SPEAK-COMPLETE" event coming from
   the synthesizer resource to the client.  This contains the reason
   text behind the "SPEAK" request completion.  This header communicates
   text describing the reason for the failure, such as an error in
   parsing the speech markup text.

   completion-reason   =   "Completion-Reason" ":"
                           quoted-string CRLF

   debugging and instrumentation purposes.  Clients MUST NOT interpret
   the completion reason text.

8.4.6.  Voice-Parameter

   This set of headers defines the voice of the speaker.

   voice-parameter    =   voice-gender
                       /   voice-age
                       /   voice-variant
                       /   voice-name

   voice-gender        =   "Voice-Gender:" voice-gender-value CRLF
   voice-gender-value  =   "male"
                       /   "female"
                       /   "neutral"
   voice-age           =   "Voice-Age:" 1*3DIGIT CRLF
   voice-variant       =   "Voice-Variant:" 1*19DIGIT CRLF
   voice-name          =   "Voice-Name:"
                           1*UTFCHAR *(1*WSP 1*UTFCHAR) CRLF


   The Voice- parameters are derived from the similarly-named attributes
   of the voice element specified in W3C's Speech Synthesis Markup
   Language Specification [W3C.REC-speech-synthesis-20040907].  Legal
   values for these parameters are as defined in that specification.

   These headers MAY be sent in "SET-PARAMS"/"GET-PARAMS" request to
   define/get default values for the entire session or MAY be sent in
   the "SPEAK" request to define default values for that speak request.
   Note that SSML content can itself set these values internal to the
   SSML document, of course.

   Voice parameter headers MAY also be sent in a CONTROL method to
   affect a "SPEAK" request in progress and change its behavior on the
   fly.  If the synthesizer resource does not support this operation, it
   MUST reject the request with a status of 403 "Unsupported Header".

8.4.7.  Prosody-Parameters

   This set of headers defines the prosody of the speech.

   prosody-parameter   =   "Prosody-" prosody-param-name ":"
                           prosody-param-value CRLF


   prosody-param-name is any one of the attribute names under the
   prosody element specified in W3C's Speech Synthesis Markup Language

   Specification [W3C.REC-speech-synthesis-20040907].  The prosody-
   param-value is any one of the value choices of the corresponding
   prosody element attribute specified in the above section.

   These headers MAY be sent in "SET-PARAMS"/"GET-PARAMS" request to
   define/get default values for the entire session or MAY be sent in
   the "SPEAK" request to define default values for that speak request.
   Furthermore, these attributes can be part of the speech text marked
   up in SSML.

   The prosody parameter headers in the "SET-PARAMS" or "SPEAK" request
   only apply if the speech data is of type text/plain and does not use
   a speech markup format.

   These prosody parameter headers MAY also be sent in a CONTROL method
   to affect a "SPEAK" request in progress and change its behavior on
   the fly.  If the synthesizer resource does not support this
   operation, it MUST respond back to the client with a status of 403
   "Unsupported Header".

8.4.8.  Speech Marker

   This header contains timestamp information in a "timestamp" field.
   This is an NTP timestamp, a 64 bit number in decimal form.  It MUST
   be synced with the RTP timestamp of the media stream through RTCP.

   Markers are bookmarks that are defined within the markup.  Most
   speech markup formats provide mechanisms to embed marker fields
   within speech texts.  The synthesizer generates SPEECH-MARKER events
   when it reaches these marker fields.  This header MUST be part of the
   SPEECH-MARKER event and contain the marker tag value after the
   timestamp, separated by a semicolon.  In these events the timestamp
   marks the time the text corresponding to the marker was emitted as
   speech by the synthesizer.

   This header MUST also be returned in responses to STOP, CONTROL, and
   BARGE-IN-OCCURRED methods, in the "SPEAK-COMPLETE" event, and in an
   IN-PROGRESS SPEAK response.  In these messages, if any markers have
   been encountered for the current SPEAK, the marker tag value MUST be
   the last embedded marker encountered.  If no markers have yet been
   encountered for the current SPEAK, only the timestamp is REQUIRED.
   Note than in these events the purpose of this header is to provide
   timestamp information associated with important events within the
   lifecycle of a request (start of SPEAK processing, end of SPEAK
   processing, receipt of CONTROL/STOP/BARGE-IN-OCCURRED).

8.4.9.  Speech Language

   This header specifies the default language of the speech data if the
   language is not specified in the markup.  The value of this header
   MUST follow RFC4646 [RFC4646] for its values.  The header MAY occur
   in "SPEAK", "SET-PARAMS" or "GET-PARAMS" requests.

   speech-language     =   "Speech-Language" ":" 1*VCHAR CRLF

8.4.10.  Fetch Hint

   When the synthesizer needs to fetch documents or other resources like
   speech markup or audio files, this header controls the corresponding
   URI access properties.  This provides client policy on when the
   synthesizer should retrieve content from the server.  A value of
   "prefetch" indicates the content MAY be downloaded when the request
   is received, whereas "safe" indicates that content MUST NOT be
   downloaded until actually referenced.  The default value is
   "prefetch".  This header MAY occur in "SPEAK", "SET-PARAMS" or
   "GET-PARAMS" requests.

   fetch-hint          =   "Fetch-Hint" ":" 1*ALPHA CRLF

8.4.11.  Audio Fetch Hint

   When the synthesizer needs to fetch documents or other resources like
   speech audio files, this header controls the corresponding URI access
   properties.  This provides client policy whether or not the
   synthesizer may attempt to optimize speech by pre-fetching audio.
   The value is either "safe" to say that audio is only fetched when it
   is referenced, never before; "prefetch" to permit, but not require
   the implementation to pre-fetch the audio; or "stream" to allow it to
   stream the audio fetches.  The default value is "prefetch".  This
   header MAY occur in "SPEAK", "SET-PARAMS" or "GET-PARAMS". requests.

   audio-fetch-hint    =   "Audio-Fetch-Hint" ":" 1*ALPHA CRLF

8.4.12.  Failed URI

   When a synthesizer method needs a synthesizer to fetch or access a
   URI and the access fails, the server SHOULD provide the failed URI in
   this header in the method response, unless there are multiple URI
   failures, in which case one of the failed URIs MUST be provided in
   this header in the method response.

   failed-uri          =   "Failed-URI" ":" Uri CRLF

8.4.13.  Failed URI Cause

   When a synthesizer method needs a synthesizer to fetch or access a
   URI and the access fails the server MUST provide the URI-specific or
   protocol-specific response code for the URI in the Failed-URI header
   in the method response through this header.  The value encoding is
   UTF-8 to accommodate any access protocol, some of which might have a
   response string instead of a numeric response code.
   failed-uri-cause    =   "Failed-URI-Cause" ":" 1*UTFCHAR CRLF

8.4.14.  Speak Restart

   When a CONTROL request to jump backward is issued to a currently
   speaking synthesizer resource, and the target jump point is before
   the start of the current "SPEAK" request, the current "SPEAK" request
   MUST restart from the beginning of its speech data and the response
   to the CONTROL request MUST contain this header indicating a restart.

   speak-restart       =   "Speak-Restart" ":" BOOLEAN CRLF

8.4.15.  Speak Length

   This header MAY be specified in a CONTROL method to control the
   length of speech to speak, relative to the current speaking point in
   the currently active "SPEAK" request.  If numeric, the value MUST be
   a positive integer.  If a header with a Tag unit is specified, then
   the speech output continues until the tag is reached or the "SPEAK"
   request complete, whichever comes first.  This header MAY be
   specified in a "SPEAK" request to indicate the length to speak from
   the speech data and is relative to the point in speech that the
   "SPEAK" request starts.  The different speech length units supported
   are synthesizer implementation dependent.  If a server does not
   support the specified unit, the resource MUST respond with a status
   code of 409 "Unsupported Header Value".

   unloaded.  The default value for this header is "true".  This header
   MAY be specified in a DEFINE-LEXICON method.

   load-lexicon       =   "Load-Lexicon" ":" BOOLEAN CRLF

8.4.17.  Lexicon-Search-Order

   This header is used to specify a list of active Lexicon URIs and the
   search order among the active lexicons.  Lexicons specified within
   the SSML document take precedence over the lexicons specified in this
   header.  This header MAY be specified in the SPEAK, SET-PARAMS, and
   GET-PARAMS methods.

8.5.  Synthesizer Message Body

   A synthesizer message may contain additional information associated
   with the Request, Response or Event in its message body.

8.5.1.  Synthesizer Speech Data

   Marked-up text for the synthesizer to speak is specified as a typed
   media entity in the message body.  The speech data to be spoken by
   the synthesizer can be specified inline by embedding the data in the
   message body or by reference by providing a URI for accessing the
   data.  In either case the data and the format used to markup the
   speech needs to be of a content type supported by the server.

   All MRCPv2 servers containing synthesizer resources MUST support both
   plain text speech data and W3C's Speech Synthesis Markup Language
   [W3C.REC-speech-synthesis-20040907] and hence MUST support the Media
   Types text/plain and application/ssml+xml.  Other formats MAY be
   supported.

   If the speech data is to be fetched by URI reference, the Media Type
   text/uri-list RFC2483 [RFC2483] is used to indicate one or more URIs
   that, when dereferenced, will contain the content to be spoken.  If a
   list of speech URIs is specified, speech data provided by each URI
   MUST be spoken in the order in which the URIs are specified in the
   content.

   A mix of URI and inline speech data may be indicated through the
   multipart/mixed Media Type.  Embedded within the multipart there MAY
   be content for the text/uri-list, application/ssml+xml and/or text/
   plain media types.  The character set and encoding used in the speech
   data is specified according to standard Media Type definitions.  The
   multi-part content MAY also contain actual audio data in .wav or sun
   audio format.  Clients may have recorded audio clips stored in memory
   or on a local device and wish to play it as part of the "SPEAK"
   request.  The audio portions MAY be sent by the client as part of the
   multi-part content block.  This audio is referenced in the speech
   markup data that is another part in the multi-part content block
   according to the multipart/mixed Media Type specification.

                             Multipart Example

8.5.2.  Lexicon Data

   Synthesizer lexicon data from the client to the server can be
   provided inline or by reference.  Either way they are carried as
   typed media in the message body of the MRCPv2 request message.

   When a lexicon is specified in-line in the message, the client MUST
   provide a Content-ID for that lexicon as part of the content headers.
   The server MUST store the lexicon associated with that Content-ID for
   the duration of the session.  A stored lexicon can be overwritten by
   defining a new lexicon with the same Content-ID.  Lexicons that have
   been associated with a Content-ID can be referenced through the

   "session:" URI scheme (see Section 13.6).

   If lexicon data is specified by external URI reference, the Media
   Type text/uri-list RFC2483 [RFC2483] is used to list the one or more
   URIs that may be dereferenced to obtain the lexicon data.  All MRCPv2
   servers MUST support the HTTP and HTTPS uri access mechanisms, and
   MAY support other mechanisms.

   If the data in the message body consists of a mix of URI and inline
   lexicon data the multipart/mixed Media Type is used.  The character
   set and encoding used in the lexicon data may be specified according
   to standard Media Type definitions.

8.6.  SPEAK Method

   The "SPEAK" Request provides the synthesizer resource with the speech
   text and initiates speech synthesis and streaming.  The "SPEAK"
   method can carry voice and prosody headers that alter the behavior of
   the voice being synthesized, as well as a typed media message body
   containing the actual marked-up text to be spoken.

   The SPEAK method implementation MUST do a fetch of all external URIs
   that are part of that operation.  If caching is implemented, this URI
   fetching MUST conform to the cache control hints and parameter
   headers associated with the method in deciding whether it is to be
   fetched from cache or from the external server.  If these hints/
   parameters are not specified in the method, the values set for the
   session using SET-PARAMS/GET-PARAMS apply.  If it was not set for the
   session their default values apply.

   When applying voice parameters there are 3 levels of precedence.  The
   highest precedence are those specified within the speech markup text,
   followed by those specified in the headers of the "SPEAK" request and
   hence apply for that "SPEAK" request only, followed by the session
   default values which can be set using the "SET-PARAMS" request and
   apply for subsequent methods invoked during the session.

   If the resource was idle at the time the "SPEAK" request arrived at
   the server and the "SPEAK" method is being actively processed, the
   resource responds immediately with a success status code and a
   request-state of IN-PROGRESS.

   If the resource is in the speaking or paused state when the "SPEAK"
   method arrives at the server, i.e. it is in the middle of processing
   a previous "SPEAK" request, the status returns success with a
   request-state of PENDING.  The server places the "SPEAK" request in
   the synthesizer resource request queue.  The request queue operates
   strictly FIFO: requests are processed serially in order of receipt.

   If the current SPEAK fails, all SPEAK methods in the pending queue
   are cancelled and each generates a SPEAK-COMPLETE event with a
   Completion-Cause of "cancelled".

   For the synthesizer resource, "SPEAK" is the only method that can
   return a request-state of IN-PROGRESS or PENDING.  When the text has
   been synthesized and played into the media stream, the resource
   issues a "SPEAK-COMPLETE" event with the request-id of the "SPEAK"
   request and a request-state of COMPLETE.

                               SPEAK Example

8.7.  STOP

   The "STOP" method from the client to the server tells the synthesizer
   resource to stop speaking if it is speaking something.

   The "STOP" request can be sent with an active-request-id-list header
   to stop the zero or more specific "SPEAK" requests that may be in
   queue and return a response code of 200 (Success).  If no active-
   request-id-list header is sent in the "STOP" request the server
   terminates all outstanding "SPEAK" requests.

   If a "STOP" request successfully terminated one or more PENDING or
   IN-PROGRESS "SPEAK" requests, then the response MUST contain an
   active-request-id-list header enumerating the "SPEAK" request-ids
   that were terminated.  Otherwise there is no active-request-id-list
   header in the response.  No "SPEAK-COMPLETE" events are sent for such
   terminated requests.

   If a "SPEAK" request that was IN-PROGRESS and speaking was stopped,
   the next pending "SPEAK" request, if any, becomes IN-PROGRESS at the
   resource and enters the speaking state.

   If a "SPEAK" request that was IN-PROGRESS and paused was stopped, the
   next pending "SPEAK" request, if any, becomes IN-PROGRESS and enters
   the paused state.

8.8.  BARGE-IN-OCCURED

   The BARGE-IN-OCCURRED method, when used with the synthesizer
   resource, provides a client which has detected a barge-in-able event
   a means to communicate the occurrence of the event to the synthesizer
   resource.

   This method is useful in two scenarios,
   1.  The client has detected DTMF digits in the input media or some
       other barge-in-able event and wants to communicate that to the
       synthesizer resource.

Internet-Draft                   MRCPv2                      August 2009


   2.  The recognizer resource and the synthesizer resource are in
       different servers.  In this case the client acts as an
       intermediary for the two servers.  It receives an event from the
       recognition resource and sends a BARGE-IN-OCCURRED request to the
       synthesizer.  In such cases, the BARGE-IN-OCCURRED method would
       also have a proxy-sync-id header received from the resource
       generating the original event.

   If a "SPEAK" request is active with kill-on-barge-in enabled, and the
   BARGE-IN-OCCURRED event is received, the synthesizer MUST immediately
   stop streaming out audio.  It MUST also terminate any speech requests
   queued behind the current active one, irrespective of whether they
   have barge-in enabled or not.  If a barge-in-able "SPEAK" request was
   playing and it was terminated, the response MUST contain the an
   active-request-list header listing the request-ids of all "SPEAK"
   requests that were terminated.  The server generates no
   "SPEAK-COMPLETE" events for these requests.

   If there were no "SPEAK" requests terminated by the synthesizer
   resource as a result of the BARGE-IN-OCCURRED method, the server
   responds to the BARGE-IN-OCCURRED with a 200 success which MUST NOT
   contain an active-request-id-list header.

   If the synthesizer and recognizer resources are part of the same
   MRCPv2 session, they can be optimized for a quicker kill-on-barge-in
   response if the recognizer and synthesizer interact directly.  In
   these cases, the client MUST still react to a START-OF-INPUT event
   from the recognizer by invoking the BARGE-IN-OCCURRED method to the
   synthesizer.  The client MUST invoke the BARGE-IN-OCCURRED if it has
   any outstanding requests to the synthesizer resource in either the
   PENDING or IN-PROGRESS state.

8.9.  PAUSE

   The PAUSE method from the client to the server tells the synthesizer
   resource to pause speech output if it is speaking something.  If a
   PAUSE method is issued on a session when a "SPEAK" is not active the
   server MUST respond with a status of 402 "Method not valid in this
   state".  If a PAUSE method is issued on a session when a "SPEAK" is
   active and paused the server MUST respond with a status of 200

8.11.  CONTROL

   The CONTROL method from the client to the server tells a synthesizer
   that is speaking to modify what it is speaking on the fly.  This
   method is used to request the synthesizer to jump forward or backward
   in what it is speaking, change speaker rate, speaker parameters, etc.
   It affects only the currently IN-PROGRESS "SPEAK" request.  Depending
   on the implementation and capability of the synthesizer resource it
   may or may not support the various modifications indicated by headers
   in the CONTROL request.

   When a client invokes a CONTROL method to jump forward and the
   operation goes beyond the end of the active "SPEAK" method's text,
   the CONTROL request still succeeds.  The active "SPEAK" request
   completes and returns a "SPEAK-COMPLETE" event following the response
   to the CONTROL method.  If there are more "SPEAK" requests in the
   queue, the synthesizer resource starts at the beginning of the next
   "SPEAK" request in the queue.

   When a client invokes a CONTROL method to jump backward and the
   operation jumps to the beginning or beyond the beginning of the
   speech data of the active "SPEAK" method, the CONTROL request still
   succeeds.  The response to the CONTROL request contains the speak-
   restart header, and the active "SPEAK" request restarts from the
   beginning of its speech data.

   These two behaviors can be used to rewind or fast-forward across
   multiple speech requests, if the client wants to break up a speech
   markup text to multiple "SPEAK" requests.

   If a "SPEAK" request was active when the CONTROL method was received
   the server MUST return an active-request-id-list header with the
   Request-id of the "SPEAK" request that was active.

8.12.  SPEAK-COMPLETE

   This is an Event message from the synthesizer resource to the client
   indicating that the corresponding "SPEAK" request was completed.  The
   request-id header matches the request-id of the "SPEAK" request that
   initiated the speech that just completed.  The request-state field is
   set to COMPLETE by the server, indicating that this is the last event
   with the corresponding request-id.  The completion-cause header
   specifies the cause code pertaining to the status and reason of
   request completion such as the "SPEAK" completed normally or because
   of an error, kill-on-barge-in etc.

8.13.  SPEECH-MARKER

   This is an event generated by the synthesizer resource to the client
   when the synthesizer encounters a marker tag in the speech markup it
   is currently processing.  The request-id field in the header matches
   the corresponding "SPEAK" request.  The request-state field indicates
   IN-PROGRESS as the speech is still not complete.  The value of the
   speech marker tag hit, describing where the synthesizer is in the
   speech markup, is returned in the speech-marker header, along with an
   NTP timestamp indicating the instant in the output speech stream that
   the marker was encountered.  The SPEECH-MARKER event MUST also be
   generated with a null marker value and output NTP timestamp when a
   SPEAK request in Pending-State (i.e. in the queue) changes state to
   IN-PROGRESS and starts speaking.  The NTP timestamp MUST be
   synchronized with the RTP timestamp used to generate the speech
   stream through standard RTCP machinery.

8.14.  DEFINE-LEXICON

   The DEFINE-LEXICON method, from the client to the server, provides a
   lexicon and tells the server to load, unload, activate or deactivate
   the lexicon.

   If the server resource is in the speaking or paused state, the server
   MUST respond 402 (Method not valid in this state) failure status.

   If the resource is in the idle state and is able to successfully
   load/unload/activate/deactivate the lexicon the status MUST return a
   success code and the request-state MUST be COMPLETE.

   If the synthesizer could not define the lexicon for some reason, for
   example because the download failed or the lexicon was in an
   unsupported form, the server MUST respond with a failure status code
   of 407, and a Completion-Cause header describing the failure reason.


9.  Speech Recognizer Resource

   The speech recognizer resource receives an incoming voice stream and
   provides the client with an interpretation of what was spoken in
   textual form.

   The recognizer resource is controlled by MRCPv2 requests from the
   client.  The recognizer resource can both respond to these requests
   and generate asynchronous events to the client to indicate conditions
   of interest during the processing of the method.

   This section applies to the following resource types.
   1.  speechrecog
   2.  dtmfrecog

   The difference between the above two resources is in their level of
   support for recognition grammars.  The "dtmfrecog" resource type is
   capable of recognizing only DTMF digits and hence accepts only DTMF
   grammars.  It only generates barge-in for DTMF inputs and ignores
   speech.  The "speechrecog" resource type can recognize regular speech
   as well as DTMF digits and hence MUST support grammars describing
   either speech or DTMF.  This resource generates barge-in events for
   speech and/or DTMF.  By analyzing the grammars that are activated by
   the RECOGNIZE method, it determines if a barge-in should occur for
   speech and/or DTMF.  When the recognizer decides it needs to generate
   barge-in it also generates a START-OF-INPUT event to the client.  The
   recognition resource may support recognition in the normal or hotword
   modes or both (although note that a single speechrecog resource does
   not perform normal and hotword mode recognition simultaneously).  For

Internet-Draft                   MRCPv2                      August 2009


   implementations where a single recognition resource does not support
   both modes, or simultaneous normal and hotword recognition is
   desired, the two modes can be invoked through separate resources
   allocated to the same SIP dialog (with different MRCP session
   identifiers) and share the RTP audio feed.

   The capabilities of the recognition resource are enumerated below:

   Normal Mode Recognition  Normal mode recognition tries to match all
      of the speech or DTMF against the grammar and returns a no-match
      status if the input fails to match or the method times out.
   Hotword Mode Recognition  Hotword mode is where the recognizer looks
      for a match against specific speech grammar or DTMF sequence and
      ignores speech or DTMF that does not match.  The recognition
      completes only for a successful match of grammar or if the client
      cancels the request or if there is a a non-input or recognition
      timeout.
   Voice Enrolled Grammars  A recognition resource may optionally
      support Voice Enrolled Grammars.  With this functionality,
      enrollment is performed using a person's voice.  For example, a
      list of contacts can be created and maintained by recording the
      person's names using the caller's voice.  This technique is
      sometimes also called speaker-dependent recognition.
   Interpretation  A recognition resource may be employed strictly for
      its natural language interpretation capabilities by supplying it
      with a text string as input instead of speech.  In this mode the
      resource takes text as input and produces an "interpretation" of
      the input according to the supplied grammar.

   Voice Enrollment has the concept of an enrollment session.  A session
   to add a new phrase to a personal grammar involves the initial
   enrollment followed by a repeat of enough utterances before
   committing the new phrase to the personal grammar.  Each time an
   utterance is recorded, it is compared for similarity with the other
   samples and a clash test is performed against other entries in the
   personal grammar to ensure there are no similar and confusable
   entries.

   Enrollment is done using a recognizer resource.  Controlling which
   utterances are to be considered for enrollment of a new phrase is
   done by setting a header (see Section 9.4.39) in the Recognize
   request.

   Interpretation is accomplished through the INTERPRET method
   (Section 9.20) and the interpret-text header (Section 9.4.30).

                         Recognizer State Machine

   If a recognition resource supports voice enrolled grammars, starting
   an enrollment session does not change the state of the recognizer
   resource.  Once an enrollment session is started, then utterances are
   enrolled by calling the RECOGNIZE method repeatedly.  The state of
   the speech recognizer resource goes from IDLE to RECOGNIZING state
   each time RECOGNIZE is called.

9.2.  Recognizer Methods

   The recognizer supports the following methods.

                        /  "STOP"

   It is OPTIONAL for a recognizer resource to support voice enrolled
   grammars.  If the recognizer resource does support voice enrolled
   grammars it MUST support the following methods.

                        /  "ENROLLMENT-ROLLBACK"

                        /  "DELETE-PHRASE"

9.3.  Recognizer Events

   The recognizer may generate the following events.

   recognizer-event     =  "START-OF-INPUT"
                        /  "RECOGNITION-COMPLETE"

                        /  abort-phrase-enrollment

   For enrollment-specific headers that can appear as part of
   "SET-PARAMS" or "GET-PARAMS" methods, the following general rule
   applies: the START-PHRASE-ENROLLMENT method must be invoked before
   these headers may be set through the "SET-PARAMS" method or retrieved
   through the "GET-PARAMS" method.

   Note that the Waveform-URI header of the Recognizer resource can also
   appear in the response to the END-PHRASE-ENROLLMENT method.

9.4.1.  Confidence Threshold

   When a recognition resource recognizes or matches a spoken phrase
   with some portion of the grammar, it associates a confidence level
   with that match.  The confidence-threshold header tells the
   recognizer resource what confidence level the client considers a
   successful match.  This is a float value between 0.0-1.0 indicating
   the recognizer's confidence in the recognition.  If the recognizer
   determines that there is no candidate match with a confidence that is
   greater than the confidence threshold, then it MUST return no-match
   as the recognition result.  This header MAY occur in RECOGNIZE,
   "SET-PARAMS" or "GET-PARAMS".  The default value for this header is
   implementation specific.

   confidence-threshold     =  "Confidence-Threshold" ":" FLOAT CRLF

9.4.2.  Sensitivity Level

   To filter out background noise and not mistake it for speech, the
   recognizer may support a variable level of sound sensitivity.  The
   sensitivity-level header is a float value between 0.0 and 1.0 and
   allows the client to set the sensitivity level for the recognizer.
   This header MAY occur in RECOGNIZE, "SET-PARAMS" or "GET-PARAMS".  A
   higher value for this header means higher sensitivity.  The default
   value for this header is implementation specific.

9.4.3.  Speed Vs Accuracy

   Depending on the implementation and capability of the recognizer
   resource it may be tunable towards Performance or Accuracy.  Higher
   accuracy may mean more processing and higher CPU utilization, meaning
   fewer active sessions per server and vice versa.  The value is a
   float between 0.0 and 1.0.  A value of 0.0 means fastest recognition.
   A value of 1.0 means best accuracy.  This header MAY occur in
   RECOGNIZE, "SET-PARAMS" or "GET-PARAMS".  The default value for this
   header is implementation specific.

   speed-vs-accuracy        =  "Speed-Vs-Accuracy" ":" FLOAT CRLF

9.4.4.  N Best List Length

   When the recognizer matches an incoming stream with the grammar, it
   may come up with more than one alternative match because of
   confidence levels in certain words or conversation paths.  If this
   header is not specified, by default, the recognition resource returns
   only the best match above the confidence threshold.  The client, by
   setting this header, can ask the recognition resource to send it more
   than 1 alternative.  All alternatives must still be above the
   confidence-threshold.  A value greater than one does not guarantee
   that the recognizer will provide the requested number of
   alternatives.  This header MAY occur in RECOGNIZE, "SET-PARAMS" or
   "GET-PARAMS".  The minimum value for this header is 1.  The default
   value for this header is 1.

   n-best-list-length       =  "N-Best-List-Length" ":" 1*19DIGIT CRLF

9.4.5.  Input Type

   When the recognizer detects barge-in-able input and generates a
   START-OF-INPUT event, that event MUST carry this header field to
   specify where the input that caused the barge-in was DTMF or speech.

   input-type         =  "Input-Type" ":"  inputs CRLF
   inputs             =  "speech" / "dtmf"

9.4.6.  No Input Timeout

   When recognition is started and there is no speech detected for a
   certain period of time, the recognizer can send a RECOGNITION-
   COMPLETE event to the client with a Completion-Cause of "no-input-
   timeout" and terminate the recognition operation.  The client can use
   the no-input-timeout header to set this timeout.  The value is in

   milliseconds and may range from 0 to an implementation specific
   maximum value.  This header MAY occur in RECOGNIZE, "SET-PARAMS" or
   "GET-PARAMS".  The default value is implementation specific.

   no-input-timeout         =  "No-Input-Timeout" ":" 1*19DIGIT CRLF

9.4.7.  Recognition Timeout

   When recognition is started and there is no match for a certain
   period of time, the recognizer can send a RECOGNITION-COMPLETE event
   to the client and terminate the recognition operation.  The
   Recognition-Timeout header allows the client to set this timeout
   value.  The value is in milliseconds.  The value for this header
   ranges from 0 to an implementation specific maximum value.  The
   default value is 10 seconds.  This header MAY occur in RECOGNIZE,
   SET-PARAMS or GET-PARAMS.

   recognition-timeout      =  "Recognition-Timeout" ":" 1*19DIGIT CRLF

9.4.8.  Waveform URI

   If the Save-Waveform header is set to true, the recognizer MUST
   record the incoming audio stream of the recognition into a stored
   form and provide a URI for the client to access it.  This header MUST
   be present in the RECOGNITION-COMPLETE event if the Save-Waveform
   header was set to true.  The value of the header MUST be empty if
   there was some error condition preventing the server from recording.
   Otherwise, the URI generated by the server MUST be unambiguous across
   the server and all its recognition sessions.  The content associated
   with the URI MUST be available to the client until the MRCPv2 session
   terminates.

   Similarly, if the Save-Best-Waveform header is set to true, the
   recognizer MUST save the audio stream for the best repetition of the
   phrase that was used during the enrollment session.  The recognizer
   MUST then record the recognized audio and make it available to the
   client by returning a URI in the Waveform-URI header in the response
   to the END-PHRASE-ENROLLMENT method.  The value of the header MUST be
   empty if there was some error condition preventing the server from
   recording.  Otherwise, the URI generated by the server MUST be
   unambiguous across the server and all its recognition sessions.  The
   content associated with the URI MUST be available to the client until
   the MRCPv2 session terminates.

   The server MUST also return the size in bytes and the duration in
   milliseconds of the recorded audio wave-form as parameters associated
   with the header.

9.4.9.  Media Type

   This header MAY be specified in the SET-PARAMS, GET-PARAMS or the
   RECOGNIZE methods and tells the server resource the Media Type in
   which to store captured audio or video such as the one captured and
   returned by the Waveform-URI header.

   processed by the RECOGNIZE operation.  This enables the client to
   request recognition from a specified buffer or audio file.

   input-waveform-uri       =  "Input-Waveform-URI" ":" Uri CRLF

9.4.11.  Completion Cause

   This header MUST be part of a RECOGNITION-COMPLETE, event coming from
   the recognizer resource to the client.  It indicates the reason
   behind the RECOGNIZE method completion.  This header MUST be sent in
   the DEFINE-GRAMMAR and RECOGNIZE responses, if they return with a
   failure status and a COMPLETE state.

9.4.12.  Completion Reason

   This header MAY be specified in a RECOGNITION-COMPLETE event coming
   from the recognizer resource to the client.  This contains the reason
   text behind the RECOGNIZE request completion.  The server uses this
   header to communicate text describing the reason for the failure,
   such as the specific error encountered in parsing a grammar markup.

   The completion reason text is provided for client use in logs and for
   debugging and instrumentation purposes.  Clients MUST NOT interpret
   the completion reason text.

9.4.13.  Recognizer Context Block

   This header MAY be sent as part of the "SET-PARAMS" or "GET-PARAMS"
   request.  If the "GET-PARAMS" method contains this header with no
   value, then it is a request to the recognizer to return the
   recognizer context block.  The response to such a message MAY contain

   a recognizer context block as a typed media message body.  If the
   server returns a recognizer context block, the response MUST contain
   this header and its value MUST match the Content-ID of the
   corresponding media block.

   If the "SET-PARAMS" method contains this header, it MUST also contain
   a message body containing the recognizer context data, and a
   Content-ID matching this header value.  This Content-ID MUST match
   the Content-ID that came with the context data during the
   "GET-PARAMS" operation.

   An implementation choosing to use this mechanism to hand off
   recognizer context data between servers MUST distinguish its
   implementation-specific block of data by using an IANA-registered
   content type in the IANA Media Type vendor tree.

9.4.14.  Start Input Timers

   This header MAY be sent as part of the RECOGNIZE request.  A value of
   false tells the recognizer to start recognition, but not to start the
   no-input timer yet.  The recognizer MUST NOT start the timers until
   the client sends a START-INPUT-TIMERS request to the recognizer.
   This is useful in the scenario when the recognizer and synthesizer
   engines are not part of the same session.  In such configurations,
   when a kill-on-barge-in prompt is being played, the client wants the
   RECOGNIZE request to be simultaneously active so that it can detect
   and implement kill-on-barge-in.  However, the recognizer ought not
   start the no-input timers until the prompt is finished.  The default
   value is "true".

   start-input-timers  =  "Start-Input-Timers" ":" BOOLEAN CRLF

9.4.15.  Speech Complete Timeout

   This header specifies the length of silence required following user
   speech before the speech recognizer finalizes a result (either
   accepting it or generating a nomatch event).  The speech-complete-
   timeout value applies when the recognizer currently has a complete
   match against an active grammar, and specifies how long the
   recognizer MUST wait for more input before declaring a match.  By
   contrast, the incomplete timeout is used when the speech is an
   incomplete match to an active grammar.  The value is in milliseconds.

  speech-complete-timeout = "Speech-Complete-Timeout" ":" 1*19DIGIT CRLF

   A long speech-complete-timeout value delays the result to the client
   and therefore makes the application's response to a user slow.  A
   short speech-complete-timeout may lead to an utterance being broken
   up inappropriately.  Reasonable speech complete timeout values are
   typically in the range of 0.3 seconds to 1.0 seconds.  The value for
   this header ranges from 0 to an implementation specific maximum
   value.  The default value for this header is implementation specific.
   This header MAY occur in RECOGNIZE, "SET-PARAMS" or "GET-PARAMS".

9.4.16.  Speech Incomplete Timeout

   This header specifies the required length of silence following user
   speech after which a recognizer finalizes a result.  The incomplete
   timeout applies when the speech prior to the silence is an incomplete
   match of all active grammars.  In this case, once the timeout is
   triggered, the partial result is rejected (with a Completion-Cause of
   "partial-match").  The value is in milliseconds.  The value for this
   header ranges from 0 to an implementation specific maximum value.
   The default value for this header is implementation specific.

   speech-incomplete-timeout = "Speech-Incomplete-Timeout" ":" 1*19DIGIT
                                CRLF

   The speech-incomplete-timeout also applies when the speech prior to
   the silence is a complete match of an active grammar, but where it is
   possible to speak further and still match the grammar.  By contrast,
   the complete timeout is used when the speech is a complete match to
   an active grammar and no further spoken words can continue to
   represent a match.

   A long speech-incomplete-timeout value delays the result to the
   client and therefore makes the application's response to a user slow.
   A short speech-incomplete-timeout may lead to an utterance being
   broken up inappropriately.

   The speech-incomplete-timeout is usually longer than the speech-
   complete-timeout to allow users to pause mid-utterance (for example,
   to breathe).  This header MAY occur in RECOGNIZE, "SET-PARAMS" or
   "GET-PARAMS".

9.4.17.  DTMF Interdigit Timeout

   This header specifies the inter-digit timeout value to use when
   recognizing DTMF input.  The value is in milliseconds.  The value for
   this header ranges from 0 to an implementation specific maximum
   value.  The default value is 5 seconds.  This header MAY occur in
   RECOGNIZE, "SET-PARAMS" or "GET-PARAMS".

9.4.18.  DTMF Term Timeout

   This header specifies the terminating timeout to use when recognizing
   DTMF input.  The DTMF-Term-Timeout applies only when no additional
   input is allowed by the grammar; otherwise, the DTMF-Interdigit-
   Timeout applies.  The value is in milliseconds.  The value for this
   header ranges from 0 to an implementation specific maximum value.
   The default value is 10 seconds.  This header MAY occur in RECOGNIZE,
   "SET-PARAMS" or "GET-PARAMS".

   dtmf-term-timeout        =  "DTMF-Term-Timeout" ":" 1*19DIGIT CRLF

9.4.19.  DTMF-Term-Char

   recognition.  The default value is NULL which is indicated by an
   empty header value.  This header MAY occur in RECOGNIZE, "SET-PARAMS"
   or "GET-PARAMS".

   dtmf-term-char           =  "DTMF-Term-Char" ":" VCHAR CRLF

9.4.20.  Failed URI

   When a recognizer needs to fetch or access a URI and the access fails
   the server SHOULD provide the failed URI in this header in the method
   response, unless there are multiple URI failures, in which case one
   of the failed URIs MUST be provided in this header in the method

9.4.21.  Failed URI Cause

   When a recognizer method needs a recognizer to fetch or access a URI
   and the access fails the server MUST provide the URI specific or
   protocol specific response code for the URI in the Failed-URI header
   through this header in the method response.  The value encoding is
   UTF-8 to accommodate any access protocol, some of which might have a
   response string instead of a numeric response code.

9.4.22.  Save Waveform

   This header allows the client to request the recognizer resource to
   save the audio input to the recognizer.  The recognizer resource MUST
   then attempt to record the recognized audio, without endpointing, and
   make it available to the client in the form of a URI returned in the
   Waveform-URI header in the RECOGNITION-COMPLETE event.  If there was
   an error in recording the stream or the audio content is otherwise
   not available, the recognizer MUST return an empty Waveform-URI
   header.  The default value for this field is "false".  This header
   MAY occur in RECOGNIZE, "SET-PARAMS" or "GET-PARAMS".

   save-waveform            =  "Save-Waveform" ":" BOOLEAN CRLF

9.4.23.  New Audio Channel

   This header MAY be specified in a RECOGNIZE request and allows the
   client to tell the server that, from this point on, further input
   audio comes from a different audio source, channel or speaker.  If
   the recognition resource had collected any input statistics or
   adaptation state, the recognition resource MUST do what is
   appropriate for the specific recognition technology, which includes
   but is not limited to discarding any collected input statistics or
   adaptation state before starting the RECOGNIZE request.  Note that if
   there are multiple resources that are sharing a media pipe and are
   collecting or using this data, and the client issues this header to
   one of the resources, the reset operation applies to all resources
   that use the shared media stream.  This helps in a number of use
   cases, including where the client wishes to reuse an open recognition
   session with an existing media session for multiple telephone calls.

   new-audio-channel        =  "New-Audio-Channel" ":" BOOLEAN
                               CRLF

9.4.24.  Speech-Language

   This header specifies the language of recognition grammar data within
   a session or request, if it is not specified within the data.  The
   value of this header MUST follow RFC4646 [RFC4646] for its values.
   This MAY occur in DEFINE-GRAMMAR, RECOGNIZE, "SET-PARAMS" or
   "GET-PARAMS" request.

9.4.25.  Ver-Buffer-Utterance

   This header lets the client request the server to buffer the
   utterance associated with this recognition request into a buffer
   available to a co-resident verification resource.  The buffer is
   shared across resources within a session and is allocated when a
   verification resource is added to this session.  The client MUST NOT
   send this header unless a verification resource is instantiated for
   the session.  The buffer is released when the verification resource
   is released from the session.

9.4.26.  Recognition-Mode

   This header specifies what mode the RECOGNIZE method will operate in.
   The value choices are "normal" or "hotword".  If the value is
   "normal", the RECOGNIZE starts matching speech and DTMF to the
   grammars specified in the RECOGNIZE request.  If any portion of the
   speech does not match the grammar, the RECOGNIZE command completes
   with a no-match status.  Timers may be active to detect speech in the
   audio (see Section 9.4.14), so the RECOGNIZE method may complete
   because of a timeout waiting for speech.  If the value of this header
   is "hotword", the RECOGNIZE method operates in hotword mode, where it
   only looks for the particular keywords or DTMF sequences specified in
   the grammar and ignores silence or other speech in the audio stream.
   The default value for this header is "normal".  This header MAY occur
   on the RECOGNIZE method.

   recognition-mode         =  "Recognition-Mode" ":" 1*ALPHA CRLF

9.4.27.  Cancel-If-Queue

   This header specifies what will happen if the client attempts to
   invoke another RECOGNIZE method when this RECOGNIZE request is
   already in progress for the resource.  The value for this header is
   Boolean.  A value of "true" means the server MUST terminate this
   RECOGNIZE request, with a Completion-Cause of "cancelled", if the
   client issues another RECOGNIZE request for the same resource.  A
   value of "false" for this header indicates to the server that this
   RECOGNIZE request will continue to completion and if the client
   issues more RECOGNIZE requests to the same resource, they are queued.
   When the currently active RECOGNIZE request is stopped or completes
   with a successful match, the first RECOGNIZE method in the queue
   becomes active.  If the current RECOGNIZE fails, all RECOGNIZE
   methods in the pending queue are cancelled and each generates a
   RECOGNITION-COMPLETE event with a Completion-Cause of "cancelled".
   This header MUST be present in every RECOGNIZE request.  There is no
   default value.

9.4.28.  Hotword-Max-Duration

   This header MAY be sent in a hotword mode RECOGNIZE request.  It
   specifies the maximum length of an utterance (in seconds) that will
   be considered for Hotword recognition.  This header, along with
   Hotword-Min-Duration, can be used to tune performance by preventing
   the recognizer from evaluating utterances that are too short or too
   long to be one of the hotwords in the grammar(s).  The value is in
   milliseconds.  The default is implementation dependent.  If present
   in a RECOGNIZE request specifying a mode other than "hotword", the
   header is ignored.

9.4.29.  Hotword-Min-Duration

   This header MAY be sent in a hotword mode RECOGNIZE request.  It
   specifies the minimum length of an utterance (in seconds) that will
   be considered for Hotword recognition.  This header, along with
   Hotword-Max-Duration, can be used to tune performance by preventing
   the recognizer from evaluating utterances that are too short or too
   long to be one of the hotwords in the grammar(s).  The value is in
   milliseconds.  The default value is implementation dependent.  If
   present in a RECOGNIZE request specifying a mode other than
   "hotword", the header is ignored.

9.4.30.  Interpret-Text

   The value of this header is used to provide a pointer to the text for
   which a natural language interpretation is desired.  The value is
   either a URI or text.  If the value is a URI, it MUST be a Content-ID
   that refers to an entity of type text/plain in the body of the
   message.  Otherwise, the server MUST treat the value as the text to
   be interpreted.  This header MUST be used when invoking the INTERPRET
   method.

   interpret-text           =  "Interpret-Text" ":" 1*VCHAR CRLF

9.4.31.  DTMF-Buffer-Time

   This header MAY be specified in a GET-PARAMS or SET-PARAMS method and
   is used to specify the size in time, in milliseconds, of the
   typeahead buffer for the recognizer.  This is the buffer that

   collects DTMF digits as they are pressed even when there is no
   RECOGNIZE command active.  When a subsequent RECOGNIZE method is
   received it MAY look to this buffer to match the RECOGNIZE request.
   If the digits in the buffer is not sufficient then it can continue to
   listen to more digits to match the grammar.  The default size of this
   DTMF buffer is platform specific.

   dtmf-buffer-time  =  "DTMF-Buffer-Time" ":" 1*19DIGIT CRLF

9.4.32.  Clear-DTMF-Buffer

   This header MAY be specified in a RECOGNIZE method and is used to
   tell the recognizer to clear the DTMF type-ahead buffer before
   starting the recognize.  The default value of this header is FALSE,
   which does not clear the typeahead buffer before starting the
   RECOGNIZE method.  If this header is specified to be TRUE, then the
   recognize will clear the DTMF buffer before starting recognition.
   This means digits pressed by the caller before the RECOGNIZE command
   was issued are discarded.

   clear-dtmf-buffer  = "Clear-DTMF-Buffer" ":" BOOLEAN CRLF

9.4.33.  Early-No-Match

   This header MAY be specified in a RECOGNIZE method and is used to
   tell the recognizer that it MUST NOT wait for the end of speech
   before processing the collected speech to match active grammars.  A
   value of TRUE indicates the recognizer MUST do early matching.  The
   default value for this header if not specified is FALSE.  If the
   recognizer does not support the processing of the collected audio
   before the end of speech this header field can be safely ignored.

   early-no-match  = "Early-No-Match" ":" BOOLEAN CRLF

9.4.34.  Num-Min-Consistent-Pronunciations

   This header MAY be specified in a START-PHRASE-ENROLLMENT,
   "SET-PARAMS", or "GET-PARAMS" method and is used to specify the
   minimum number of consistent pronunciations that must be obtained to
   voice enroll a new phrase.  The minimum value is 1.  The default
   value is implementation specific and MAY be greater than 1.

9.4.35.  Consistency-Threshold

   This header MAY be sent as part of the START-PHRASE-ENROLLMENT,
   "SET-PARAMS", or "GET-PARAMS" method.  Used during voice-enrollment,
   this header specifies how similar to a previously enrolled
   pronunciation of the same phrase an utterance needs to be in order to
   be considered "consistent."  The higher the threshold, the closer the
   match between an utterance and previous pronunciations must be for
   the pronunciation to be considered consistent.  The range for this
   threshold is a float value between is 0.0 to 1.0.  The default value
   for this header is implementation specific.

   consistency-threshold    =  "Consistency-Threshold" ":" FLOAT CRLF

9.4.36.  Clash-Threshold

   This header MAY be sent as part of the START-PHRASE-ENROLLMENT, SET-
   PARAMS, or "GET-PARAMS" method.  Used during voice-enrollment, this
   header specifies how similar the pronunciations of two different
   phrases can be before they are considered to be clashing.  For
   example, pronunciations of phrases such as "John Smith" and "Jon
   Smits" may be so similar that they are difficult to distinguish
   correctly.  A smaller threshold reduces the number of clashes
   detected.  The range for this threshold is float value between 0.0
   and 1.0.  The default value for this header is implementation
   specific.  Clash testing can be turned off completely by setting the
   Clash-Threshold header value to 0.

   clash-threshold          =  "Clash-Threshold" ":" FLOAT CRLF

9.4.37.  Personal-Grammar-URI

   This header specifies the speaker-trained grammar to be used or
   referenced during enrollment operations.  Phrases are added to this
   grammar during enrollment.  For example, a contact list for user
   "Jeff" could be stored at the Personal-Grammar-URI
   "http://myserver.example.com/myenrollmentdb/jeff-list".  The
   generated grammar syntax MAY be implementation specific.  There is no
   default value for this header.  This header MAY be sent as part of
   the START-PHRASE-ENROLLMENT, SET-PARAMS, or "GET-PARAMS" method.

   personal-grammar-uri     =  "Personal-Grammar-URI" ":" Uri CRLF

9.4.38.  Enroll-Utterance

   This header MAY be specified in the RECOGNIZE method.  If this header
   is set to "true" and an Enrollment is active, the RECOGNIZE command
   MUST add the collected utterance to the personal grammar that is

   may be an area of future standardization.  The default value for this
   header is "false".

   enroll-utterance     =  "Enroll-Utterance" ":" boolean-Value CRLF

9.4.39.  Phrase-Id

   This header in a request identifies a phrase in an existing personal
   grammar for which enrollment is desired.  It is also returned to the
   client in the RECOGNIZE complete event.  This header MAY occur in
   START-PHRASE-ENROLLMENT, MODIFY-PHRASE or DELETE-PHRASE requests.
   There is no default value for this header.

   phrase-id                =  "Phrase-ID" ":" 1*VCHAR CRLF

9.4.40.  Phrase-NL

   This string specifies the interpreted text to be returned when the
   phrase is recognized.  This header MAY occur in START-PHRASE-
   ENROLLMENT and MODIFY-PHRASE requests.  There is no default value for
   this header.

   phrase-nl                =  "Phrase-NL" ":" 1*UTFCHAR CRLF

9.4.41.  Weight

   The value of this header represents the occurrence likelihood of a
   phrase in an enrolled grammar.  When using grammar enrollment, the
   system is essentially constructing a grammar segment consisting of a
   list of possible match phrases.  This can be thought of to be similar
   to the dynamic construction of a <one-of> tag in the W3C grammar
   specification.  Each enrolled-phrase becomes an item in the list that
   can be matched against spoken input similar to the <item> within a
   <one-of> list.  This header allows you to assign a weight to the
   phrase (i.e., <item> entry) in the <one-of> list that is enrolled.
   Grammar weights are normalized to a sum of one at grammar compilation
   time, so a weight value of 1 for each phrase in an enrolled grammar
   list indicates all items in that list have the same weight.  This
   header MAY occur in START-PHRASE-ENROLLMENT and MODIFY-PHRASE
   requests.  The default value for this header is implementation
   specific.

9.4.42.  Save-Best-Waveform

   This header allows the client to request the recognizer resource to
   save the audio stream for the best repetition of the phrase that was
   used during the enrollment session.  The recognizer MUST attempt to
   record the recognized audio and make it available to the client in
   the form of a URI returned in the Waveform-URI header in the response
   to the END-PHRASE-ENROLLMENT method.  If there was an error in
   recording the stream or the audio data is otherwise not available,
   the recognizer MUST return an empty Waveform-URI header.  This header
   MAY occur in the START-PHRASE-ENROLLMENT, SET-PARAMS, and GET-PARAMS
   methods.

   save-best-waveform  =  "Save-Best-Waveform" ":" BOOLEAN CRLF

9.4.43.  New-Phrase-Id

   This header replaces the id used to identify the phrase in a personal
   grammar.  The recognizer returns the new id when using an enrollment
   grammar.  This header MAY occur in MODIFY-PHRASE requests.

   new-phrase-id            =  "New-Phrase-ID" ":" 1*VCHAR CRLF

9.4.44.  Confusable-Phrases-URI

   This header specifies a grammar that defines invalid phrases for
   enrollment.  For example, typical applications do not allow an
   enrolled phrase that is also a command word.  This header MAY occur
   in RECOGNIZE requests that are part of an enrollment session.

   confusable-phrases-uri   =  "Confusable-Phrases-URI" ":" Uri CRLF

9.4.45.  Abort-Phrase-Enrollment

   This header can optionally be specified in the END-PHRASE-ENROLLMENT
   method to abort the phrase enrollment, rather than committing the
   phrase to the personal grammar.

   abort-phrase-enrollment  =  "Abort-Phrase-Enrollment" ":"
                               BOOLEAN CRLF

9.5.  Recognizer Message Body

   A recognizer message may carry additional data associated with the
   request, response or event.  The client may provide the grammar to be
   recognized in DEFINE-GRAMMAR or RECOGNIZE requests.  When one or more
   grammars are specified using the DEFINE-GRAMMAR method, the server
   MUST attempt to fetch, compile and optimize the grammar before



Shanmugham & Burnett    Expires February 12, 2010              [Page 91]

Internet-Draft                   MRCPv2                      August 2009


   returning a response to the DEFINE-GRAMMAR method.  A RECOGNIZE
   request MUST completely specify the grammars to be active during the
   recognition operation, except when the RECOGNIZE method is being used
   to enroll a grammar.  During grammar enrollment, such grammars are
   optional.  The server resource may send the recognition results in
   the RECOGNITION-COMPLETE event or the GET-RESULT response.  Grammars
   and recognition results are carried in the message body of the
   corresponding MRCPv2 messages.

9.5.1.  Recognizer Grammar Data

   Recognizer grammar data from the client to the server can be provided
   inline or by reference.  Either way, grammar data is carried as typed
   media entities in the message body of the RECOGNIZE or DEFINE-GRAMMAR
   request.  All MRCPv2 servers MUST accept grammars in the XML form
   (Media Type application/srgs+xml) of the W3C's XML-based Speech
   Grammar Markup Format (SRGS) [W3C.REC-speech-grammar-20040316] and
   MAY accept grammars in other formats.  Examples include but are not
   limited to:
   o  the ABNF form (Media Type application/srgs) of SRGS
   o  Sun's Java Speech Grammar Format [refs.javaSpeechGrammarFormat]
   Additionally, MRCPv2 servers MAY support the Semantic Interpretation
   for Speech Recognition (SISR)
   [W3C.REC-semantic-interpretation-20070405] specification.

   When a grammar is specified inline in the request, the client MUST
   provide a Content-ID for that grammar as part of the content headers.
   If there is no space on the server to store the inline grammar, the
   request MUST return with a Completion-Cause code of 016 grammar-
   definition-failure.  Otherwise, the server MUST associate the inline
   grammar block with that Content-ID and MUST store it on the server
   for the duration of the session.  However, if the Content-ID is
   redefined later in the session through a subsequent DEFINE-GRAMMAR,
   the inline grammar previously associated with the Content-ID MUST be
   freed.  If the Content-ID is redefined through a subsequent DEFINE-
   GRAMMAR with an empty message body (i.e. no grammar definition), then
   in addition to freeing any grammar previously associated with the
   Content-ID the server MUST clear all bindings and associations to the
   Content-ID.  Unless and until subsequently redefined, this URI MUST
   be interpreted by the server as one that has never been set.

   Grammars that have been associated with a Content-ID can be
   referenced through the "session:" URI scheme (see Section 13.6).  For
   example:
   session:help@root-level.store

   Grammar data MAY be specified using external URI references.  To do
   so, the client uses a body of Media Type text/uri-list RFC2483



Shanmugham & Burnett    Expires February 12, 2010              [Page 92]

Internet-Draft                   MRCPv2                      August 2009


   [RFC2483] to list the one or more URIs that point to the grammar
   data.  The client can use a body of Media Type text/grammar-ref-list
   if it wants to assign weights to the list of grammar URI.  All MRCPv2
   servers MUST support grammar access using the HTTP and HTTPS uri
   schemes.

   If the grammar data the client wishes to be used on a request
   consists of a mix of URI and inline grammar data the client uses the
   multipart/mixed Media Type to enclose the text/uri-list, application/
   srgs or application/srgs+xml content entities.  The character set and
   encoding used in the grammar data are specified using to standard
   Media Type definitions.

   When more than one grammar URI or inline grammar block is specified
   in a message body of the RECOGNIZE request, the server interprets
   this as a list of grammar alternatives to match against.

9.5.3.  Enrollment Result Data

   Enrollment results are returned to the client in the message body of
   the RECOGNITION-COMPLETE event as described in Section 6.3).  Element
   and attribute descriptions for the enrollment portion of the NLSML
   format are provided in Section 9.7 with a normative definition of the
   schema in Section 16.2.

9.5.4.  Recognizer Context Block

   When a client changes servers while operating on the behalf of the
   same incoming communication session, this header allows the client to
   collect a block of opaque data from one server and provide it to
   another server.  This capability is desirable if the client needs
   different language support or because the server issued a redirect.
   Here the first recognizer resource may have collected acoustic and
   other data during its execution of recognition methods.  After a
   server switch, communicating this data may allow the recognition
   resource on the new server to provide better recognition.  This block
   of data is implementation-specific and MUST be carried as Media Type
   application/octets in the body of the message.

   This block of data is communicated in the "SET-PARAMS" and
   "GET-PARAMS" method/response messages.  In the "GET-PARAMS" method,
   if an empty recognizer-context-block header is present, then the
   recognizer SHOULD return its vendor-specific context block, if any,
   in the message body as an entity of Media Type application/octets
   with a specific Content-ID.  The Content-ID value MUST also be
   specified in the recognizer-context-block header in the "GET-PARAMS"
   response.  The "SET-PARAMS" request wishing to provide this vendor-
   specific data MUST send it in the message body as a typed entity with
   the same Content-ID that it received from the "GET-PARAMS".  The
   Content-ID MUST also be sent in the recognizer-context-block header
   of the "SET-PARAMS" message.

   Each speech recognition implementation choosing to use this mechanism
   to hand off recognizer context data among servers MUST distinguish
   its implementation-specific block of data from other implementations
   by choosing a Content-ID that is recognizable among the participating
   servers and unlikely to collide with values chosen by another
   implementation.

9.6.  Recognizer Results

   The recognizer portion of NLSML (see Section 6.3.1) represents
   information automatically extracted from a user's utterances by a
   semantic interpretation component, where "utterance" is to be taken
   in the general sense of a meaningful user input in any modality

   supported by the MRCPv2 implementation.

9.6.1.  Markup Functions

   MRCPv2 recognition resources employ the Natural Language Semantics
   Markup Language to interpret natural language speech input and to
   format the interpretation for consumption by an MRCPv2 client.

   The elements of the markup fall into the following general functional
   categories: Interpretation, Side Information, and Multi-Modal
   Integration.

9.6.1.1.  Interpretation

   Elements and attributes represent the semantics of a user's
   utterance, including the <result>, <interpretation>, and <instance>
   elements.  The <result> element contains the full result of
   processing one utterance.  It may contain multiple <interpretation>
   elements if the interpretation of the utterance results in multiple
   alternative meanings due to uncertainty in speech recognition or
   natural language understanding.  There are at least two reasons for
   providing multiple interpretations:
   1.  the client application might have additional information, for
       example, information from a database, that would allow it to
       select a preferred interpretation from among the possible
       interpretations returned from the semantic interpreter.
   2.  a client-based dialog manager (e.g.  VXML) that was unable to
       select between several competing interpretations could use this
       information to go back to the user and find out what was
       intended.  For example, it could issue a "SPEAK" request to a
       synthesizer resource to emit "Did you say 'Boston' or 'Austin'?"

9.6.1.2.  Side Information

   These are elements and attributes representing additional information
   about the interpretation, over and above the interpretation itself.
   Side information includes:
   1.  Whether an interpretation was achieved (the <nomatch> element)
       and the system's confidence in an interpretation (the
       "confidence" attribute of <interpretation>).
   2.  Alternative interpretations (<interpretation>)
   3.  Input formats and ASR information: the <input> element,
       representing the input to the semantic interpreter.

9.6.1.3.  Multi-Modal Integration

   When more than one modality is available for input, the
   interpretation of the inputs need to be coordinated.  The "mode"



Shanmugham & Burnett    Expires February 12, 2010              [Page 98]

Internet-Draft                   MRCPv2                      August 2009


   attribute of <input> supports this by indicating whether the
   utterance was input by speech, dtmf, pointing, etc.  The
   "timestamp_start" and "timestamp_end" attributes of <interpretation>
   also provide for temporal coordination by indicating when inputs
   occurred.

9.6.2.  Overview of Recognizer Result Elements and their Relationships

   The recognizer elements in NLSML fall into two categories:
   1.  description of the input that was processed.
   2.  description of the meaning which was extracted from the input.
   Next to each element are its attributes.  In addition, some elements
   can contain multiple instances of other elements.  For example, a
   <result> can contain multiple <interpretations>, each of which is
   taken to be an alternative.  Similarly, <input> can contain multiple
   child <input> elements which are taken to be cumulative.  To
   illustrate the basic usage of these elements, as a simple example,
   consider the utterance "ok" (interpreted as "yes").  The example
   illustrates how that utterance and its interpretation would be
   represented in the NL Semantics markup.

   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <result xmlns="http://www.ietf.org/xml/ns/mrcpv2"
           xmlns:ex="http://www.example.com/example"
           grammar="http://www.example.com/theYesNoGrammar">
     <interpretation>
        <instance>
           <ex:response>yes</ex:response>
         </instance>
       <input>ok</input>
     </interpretation>
   </result>

   This example includes only the minimum required information.  There
   is an overall <result> element which includes one interpretation and
   an input element.  The interpretation contains the application-
   specific element "<response>" which is the semantically interpreted
   result.

9.6.3.  Elements and Attributes

9.6.3.1.  RESULT Root Element

   The root element of the markup is <result>.  The <result> element
   includes one or more <interpretation> elements.  Multiple
   interpretations can result from ambiguities in the input or in the
   semantic interpretation.  If the "grammar" attribute does not apply
   to all of the interpretations in the result it can be overridden for



Shanmugham & Burnett    Expires February 12, 2010              [Page 99]

Internet-Draft                   MRCPv2                      August 2009


   individual interpretations at the <interpretation> level.

   Attributes:
   1.  grammar: The grammar or recognition rule matched by this result.
       The format of the grammar attribute will match the rule reference
       semantics defined in the grammar specification.  Specifically,
       the rule reference is in the external XML form for grammar rule
       references.  The markup interpreter needs to know the grammar
       rule that is matched by the utterance because multiple rules may
       be simultaneously active.  The value is the grammar URI used by
       the markup interpreter to specify the grammar.  The grammar can
       be overridden by a grammar attribute in the <interpretation>
       element if the input was ambiguous as to which grammar it
       matched.  If all interpretation elements within the result
       element contain carry their own grammar attributes, the attribute
       can be dropped from the result element.

   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <result xmlns="http://www.ietf.org/xml/ns/mrcpv2"
           grammar="http://www.example.com/grammar">
     <interpretation>
      ....
     </interpretation>
   </result>

9.6.3.2.  INTERPRETATION Element

   An <interpretation> element contains a single semantic
   interpretation.

   Attributes:
   1.  confidence: A float value from 0.0-1.0 indicating the semantic
       analyzer's confidence in this interpretation.  A value of 1.0
       indicates maximum confidence.  The values are implementation-
       dependent, but are intended to align with the value
       interpretation for the confidence MRCPv2 header defined in
       Section 9.4.1.  This attribute is optional.
   2.  grammar: The grammar or recognition rule matched by this
       interpretation (if needed to override the grammar specification
       at the <interpretation> level.)  This attribute is only needed
       under <interpretation> if it is necessary to override a grammar
       that was defined at the <result> level.)  Note that the grammar
       attribute for the interpretation element is OPTIONAL if and only
       if the grammar attribute is specified in the result element.

   Interpretations MUST be sorted best-first by some measure of
   "goodness".  The goodness measure is "confidence" if present,
   otherwise, it is some implementation-specific indication of quality.



Shanmugham & Burnett    Expires February 12, 2010             [Page 100]

Internet-Draft                   MRCPv2                      August 2009


   The grammar is expected to be specified most frequently at the
   <result> level.  However, it can be overridden at the
   <interpretation> level because it is possible that different
   interpretations may match different grammar rules.

   The <interpretation> element includes an optional <input> element
   which contains the input being analyzed, and an <instance> element
   containing the interpretation of the utterance.

   <interpretation confidence="0.75"
                   grammar="http://www.example.com/grammar">
       ...
   </interpretation>

9.6.3.3.  INSTANCE Element

   The <instance> element contains the interpretation of the utterance.
   When the Semantic Interpretation for Speech Recognition format is
   used, the <instance> element contains the XML serialization of the
   ECMAScript result using the approach defined in that specification.
   When there is semantic markup in the grammar that does not create
   semantic objects, but instead only does a semantic translation of a
   portion of the input, such as translating "coke" to "coca-cola", the
   instance contains the whole input but with the translation applied.
   The NLSML looks like the markup in Figure 2 below.  If there are no
   semantic objects created, nor any semantic translation the instance
   value is the same as the input value.

   Attributes:
   1.  confidence: Each element of the instance may have a confidence
       attribute, defined in the NL semantics namespace.  The confidence
       attribute contains an float value in the range from 0.0-1.0
       reflecting the system's confidence in the analysis of that slot.
       A value of 1.0 indicates maximum confidence.  The values are
       implementation-dependent, but are intended to align with the
       value interpretation for the confidence MRCPv2 header defined in
       Section 9.4.1.  This attribute is optional.

9.6.3.4.  INPUT Element

   The <input> element is the text representation of a user's input.  It
   includes an optional "confidence" attribute which indicates the
   recognizer's confidence in the recognition result (as opposed to the
   confidence in the interpretation, which is indicated by the
   "confidence" attribute of <interpretation>).  Optional "timestamp-
   start" and "timestamp-end" attributes indicate the start and end
   times of a spoken utterance, in ISO 8601 format.

   Attributes:
   1.  timestamp-start: The time at which the input began. (optional)
   2.  timestamp-end: The time at which the input ended. (optional)
   3.  mode: The modality of the input, for example, speech, dtmf, etc.
       (optional)
   4.  confidence: the confidence of the recognizer in the correctness
       of the input in the range 0.0 to 1.0 (optional)
   Note that it may not make sense for temporally overlapping inputs to
   have the same mode; however, this constraint is not expected to be
   enforced by implementations.

   When there is no time zone designator, ISO 8601 time representations
   default to local time.

   There are three possible formats for the <input> element.

   1.  The <input> element can contain simple text:
   <input>onions</input>
       A future possibility is for <input> to contain not only text but
       additional markup that represents prosodic information that was
       contained in the original utterance and extracted by the speech
       recognizer.  This depends on the availability of ASR's that are
       capable of producing prosodic information.  MRCPv2 clients MUST
       be prepared to receive such markup and MAY make use of it.
   2.  An <input> tag can also contain additional <input> tags.  Having
       additional input elements allows the representation to support
       future multi-modal inputs as well as finer-grained speech
       information, such as timestamps for individual words and word-
       level confidences.
   <input>
        <input mode="speech" confidence="0.5"
            timestamp-start="2000-04-03T0:00:00"
            timestamp-end="2000-04-03T0:00:00.2">fried</input>
        <input mode="speech" confidence="1.0"
            timestamp-start="2000-04-03T0:00:00.25"
            timestamp-end="2000-04-03T0:00:00.6">onions</input>
   </input>
   3.  Finally, the <input> element can contain <nomatch> and <noinput>
       elements, which describe situations in which the speech
       recognizer received input that it was unable to process, or did
       not receive any input at all, respectively.

9.6.3.5.  NOMATCH Element

   The <nomatch> element under <input> is used to indicate that the
   semantic interpreter was unable to successfully match any input with
   confidence above the threshold.  It can optionally contain the text
   of the best of the (rejected) matches.

   <interpretation>
      <instance/>
         <input confidence="0.1">
            <nomatch/>
         </input>
   </interpretation>
   <interpretation>
      <instance/>
      <input mode="speech" confidence="0.1">
        <nomatch>I want to go to New York</nomatch>
      </input>
   </interpretation>

Internet-Draft                   MRCPv2                      August 2009


9.6.3.6.  NOINPUT Element

   <noinput> indicates that there was no input - a timeout occurred in
   the speech recognizer due to silence.
   <interpretation>
      <instance/>
      <input>
         <noinput/>
      </input>
   </interpretation>

   If there are multiple levels of inputs, the most natural place for
   <nomatch> and <noinput> elements to appear is under the highest level
   of <input> for <no input>, and under the appropriate level of
   <interpretation> for <nomatch>.  So <noinput> means "no input at all"
   and <nomatch> means "no match in speech modality" or "no match in
   dtmf modality".  For example, to represent garbled speech combined
   with dtmf "1 2 3 4", the markup would be:
   <input>
      <input mode="speech"><nomatch/></input>
      <input mode="dtmf">1 2 3 4</input>
   </input>

   Note: while <noinput> could be represented as an attribute of input,
   <nomatch> cannot, since it could potentially include PCDATA content
   with the best match.  For parallelism, <noinput> is also an element.

9.7.  Enrollment Results

   All enrollment elements are contained within a single <enrollment-
   result> element under <result>.  The elements are described below and
   have the schema defined in Section 16.2.  The following elements are
   defined:

   1.  num-clashes
   2.  num-good-repetitions
   3.  num-repetitions-still-needed
   4.  consistency-status
   5.  clash-phrase-ids
   6.  transcriptions
   7.  confusable-phrases

9.7.1.  NUM-CLASHES Element

   The <num-clashes> element contains the number of clashes that this
   pronunciation has with other pronunciations in an active enrollment
   session.  The associated Clash-Threshold header determines the
   sensitivity of the clash measurement.  Note that clash testing can be

   turned off completely by setting the Clash-Threshold header value to
   0.

9.7.2.  NUM-GOOD-REPETITIONS Element

   The <num-good-repetitions> element contains the number of consistent
   pronunciations obtained so far in an active enrollment session.

9.7.3.  NUM-REPETITIONS-STILL-NEEDED Element

   The <num-repetitions-still-needed> element contains the number of
   consistent pronunciations that must still be obtained before the new
   phrase can be added to the enrollment grammar.  The number of
   consistent pronunciations required is specified by the client in the
   request header Num-Min-Consistent-Pronunciations.  The returned value
   must be 0 before the client can successfully commit a phrase to the
   grammar by ending the enrollment session.

9.7.4.  CONSISTENCY-STATUS Element

   The <consistency-status> element is used to indicate how consistent
   the repetitions are when learning a new phrase.  It can have the
   values of consistent, inconsistent, and undecided.

9.7.5.  CLASH-PHRASE-IDS Element

   The <clash-phrase-ids> element contains the phrase ids of clashing
   pronunciation(s), if any.  This element is absent if there are no
   clashes.

9.7.6.  TRANSCRIPTIONS Element

   The <transcriptions> element contains the transcriptions returned in
   the last repetition of the phrase being enrolled.

9.7.7.  CONFUSABLE-PHRASES Element

   The <confusable-phrases> element contains a list of phrases from a
   command grammar that are confusable with the phrase being added to
   the personal grammar.  This element may be absent if there are no
   confusable phrases.

9.8.  DEFINE-GRAMMAR

   The DEFINE-GRAMMAR method, from the client to the server, provides
   one or more grammars and requests the server to access, fetch, and
   compile the grammars as needed.  The DEFINE-GRAMMAR method
   implementation MUST do a fetch of all external URIs that are part of



Shanmugham & Burnett    Expires February 12, 2010             [Page 105]

Internet-Draft                   MRCPv2                      August 2009


   that operation.  If caching is implemented, this URI fetching MUST
   conform to the cache control hints and parameter headers associated
   with the method in deciding whether it should be fetched from cache
   or from the external server.  If these hints/parameters are not
   specified in the method, the values set for the session using SET-
   PARAMS/GET-PARAMS apply.  If it was not set for the session their
   default values apply.

   If the server resource is in the recognition state, the DEFINE-
   GRAMMAR request MUST respond with a failure status.

   If the resource is in the idle state and is able to successfully
   process the supplied grammars, the server MUST return a success code
   status and the request-state MUST be COMPLETE.

   If the recognizer resource could not define the grammar for some
   reason, for example if the download failed, the grammar failed to
   compile, or the grammar was in an unsupported form, the MRCPv2
   response for the DEFINE-GRAMMAR method MUST contain a failure status
   code of 407, and contain a completion-cause header describing the
   failure reason.

                          Define Grammar Example

9.9.  RECOGNIZE

   The RECOGNIZE method from the client to the server requests the
   recognizer to start recognition and provides it with one or more
   grammar references for grammars to match against the input media.
   The RECOGNIZE method can carry headers to control the sensitivity,
   confidence level and the level of detail in results provided by the
   recognizer.  These header values override the current values set by a
   previous "SET-PARAMS" method.



Shanmugham & Burnett    Expires February 12, 2010             [Page 109]

Internet-Draft                   MRCPv2                      August 2009


   The RECOGNIZE method can request the recognizer resource to operate
   in normal or hotword mode as specified by the Recognition-Mode
   header.  The default value is "normal".  If the resource could not
   start a recognition, the server MUST respond with a failure status
   code of 407 and a completion-cause header in the response describing
   the cause of failure.

   The RECOGNIZE request uses the message body to specify the grammars
   applicable to the request.  The active grammar(s) for the request can
   be specified in one of 3 ways.  If the client needs to explicitly
   control grammar weights for the recognition operation, it must employ
   method 3 below.  The order of these grammars specifies the precedence
   of the grammars which is used when more than one grammar in the list
   matches the speech; in this case, the grammar with the higher
   precedence is returned as a match.  This precedence capability is
   useful in applications like VoiceXML browsers to order grammars
   specified at the dialog, document and root level of a VoiceXML
   application.
   1.  The grammar may be placed directly in the message body as typed
       content.  If more than one grammar is included in the body, the
       order of inclusion controls the corresponding precedence for the
       grammars during recognition, with earlier grammars in the body
       having a higher precedence than later ones.
   2.  The body may contain a list of grammar URIs specified in content
       of Media Type text/uri-list RFC2483 [RFC2483].  The order of the
       URIs determines the corresponding precedence for the grammars
       during recognition, with highest-precedence first and decreasing
       for each URI thereafter.
   3.  The body may contain a list of grammar URIs specified in content
       of Media Type text/grammar-ref-list.  This type defines a list of
       grammar URIs and allows each grammar URI to be assigned a weight
       in the list.  This weight has the same meaning as the W3C grammar
       weights.
   In addition to performing recognition on the input, the recognizer
   may also enroll the collected utterance in a personal grammar if the
   Enroll-Utterance header is set to true and an Enrollment is active
   (via an earlier execution of the START-PHRASE-ENROLLMENT method).  If
   so, and if the RECOGNIZE request contains a Content-ID header, then
   the resulting grammar (which includes the personal grammar as a sub-
   grammar) can be referenced through the "session:" URI scheme (see
   Section 13.6).

   If the resource was able to successfully start the recognition, the
   server MUST return a success code and a request-state of IN-PROGRESS.
   This means that the recognizer is active and that the client MUST be
   prepared to receive further events with this request-id.

   If the resource was able to queue the request the server MUST return



Shanmugham & Burnett    Expires February 12, 2010             [Page 110]

Internet-Draft                   MRCPv2                      August 2009


   a success code and request-state of PENDING.  This means that the
   recognizer is currently active with another request and that this
   request has been queued for processing.

   If the resource could not start a recognition, the server MUST
   respond with a failure status code of 407 and a completion-cause
   header in the response describing the cause of failure.

   For the recognizer resource, RECOGNIZE is the only request that
   returns a request-state of IN-PROGRESS, meaning that recognition is
   in progress.  When the recognition completes by matching one of the
   grammar alternatives or by a time-out without a match or for some
   other reason, the recognizer resource MUST send the client a
   RECOGNITION-COMPLETE event with the result of the recognition and a
   request-state of COMPLETE.

   Large grammars can take a long time for the server to compile.  For
   grammars which are used repeatedly, the client can improve server
   performance by issuing a DEFINE-GRAMMAR request with the grammar
   ahead of time.  In such a case the client can issue the RECOGNIZE
   request and reference the grammar through the "session:" URI scheme
   (see Section 13.6).  This also applies in general if the client wants
   to repeat recognition with a previous inline grammar.

   The RECOGNIZE method implementation MUST do a fetch of all external
   URIs that are part of that operation.  If caching is implemented,
   this URI fetching MUST conform to the cache control hints and
   parameter headers associated with the method in deciding whether it
   should be fetched from cache or from the external server.  If these
   hints/parameters are not specified in the method, the values set for
   the session using SET-PARAMS/GET-PARAMS apply.  If it was not set for
   the session their default values apply.

   Note that since the audio and the messages are carried over separate
   communication paths there may be a race condition between the start
   of the flow of audio and the receipt of the RECOGNIZE method.  For
   example, if an audio flow is started by the client at the same time
   as the RECOGNIZE method is sent, either the audio or the RECOGNIZE
   can arrive at the recognizer first.  As another example, the client
   may choose to continuously send audio to the Server and signal the
   Server to recognize using the RECOGNIZE method.  A number of
   mechanisms exist to resolve this condition and the mechanism chosen
   is left to the implementer of the recognition resource.  The
   recognizer can expect the media to start flowing when it receives the
   recognize request, but MUST NOT buffer anything it receives
   beforehand.

   When a RECOGNIZE method has been received the recognition is



Shanmugham & Burnett    Expires February 12, 2010             [Page 111]

Internet-Draft                   MRCPv2                      August 2009


   initiated on the stream.  The No-Input-Timer MUST BE started at this
   time if the Start-Input-Timers header is specified as "true".  If
   this header is set to "false", the No-Input-Timer MUST be started
   when it receives the START-INPUT-TIMERS method from the client.  The
   Recognition-Timer MUST be started when the recognition resource
   detects speech or a DTMF digit in the media stream.

   Non-Hotword mode recognition:

   When the recognition resource detects speech or a DTMF digit in the
   media stream it MUST send the START-OF-INPUT event.  When enough
   speech has been collected for the server to process, the recognizer
   can try to match the collected speech with the active grammars.  If
   the speech collected at this point fully matches with any of the
   active grammars, the Speech-Complete-Timer is started.  If it matches
   partially with one or more of the active grammars, with more speech
   needed before a full match is achieved, then the Speech-Incomplete-
   Timer is started.

   1.  When the No-Input-Timer expires, the recognizer must complete
   with a Completion-Cause code of "no-input-timeout".

   2.  The recognizer MUST support detecting a no-match condition upon
   detecting end of speech.  The recognizer MAY support detecting a no-
   match condition before waiting for end-of-speech.  If this is
   supported, this capability is enabled by setting the "Early-No-Match"
   header to "true".  Upon detecting a no-match condition the RECOGNIZE
   MUST return with "no-match".

   3.  When the Speech-Incomplete-Timer expires the recognizer SHOULD
   complete with a Completion-Cause code of "partial-match", unless the
   recognizer cannot differentiate a partial-match in which case it MUST
   return a Completion-Cause code of "no-match".  The recognizer MAY
   return results for the partially matched grammar.

   4.  When the Speech-Complete-Timer expires the recognizer MUST
   complete with a Completion-Cause code of "success".

   5.  When the Recognition-Timer expires one of the following MUST
   happen:

   5.1 If there was a partial-match the recognizer SHOULD complete with
   a Completion-Cause code of "partial-match-maxtime", unless the
   recognizer cannot differentiate a partial-match in which case it MUST
   complete with a Completion-Cause code of "no-match-maxtime".  The
   recognizer MAY return results for the partially matched grammar.

   5.2 If there was a full-match the recognizer MUST complete with a



Shanmugham & Burnett    Expires February 12, 2010             [Page 112]

Internet-Draft                   MRCPv2                      August 2009


   Completion-Cause code of "success-maxtime".

   5.3 If there was a no match the recognizer MUST complete with a
   Completion-Cause code of "no-match-maxtime".

   For the Hotword mode recognition:

   Note that for Hotword mode recognition the START-OF-INPUT event is
   not generated when speech or a DTMF digit is detected.

   1.  When the No-Input-Timer expires, the recognizer must complete
   with a Completion-Cause code of "no-input-timeout".

   2.  When there is match at anytime, the RECOGNIZE completes with a
   Completion-Cause code of "success".

   3.  When the Recognition-Timer expires and there is not a match, the
   RECOGNIZE MUST complete with a Completion-Cause code of "hotword-
   maxtime".

   4.  When the Recognition-Timer expires and there is a match, the
   RECOGNIZE MUST complete with a Completion-Cause code of "success-
   maxtime".

   5.  When the Recognition-Timer is running but the detected speech/
   DTMF has not resulted in a match, the Recognition-Timer MUST be
   stopped and reset.  It MUST then be restarted when speech/DTMF is
   again detected.

9.10.  STOP

   The "STOP" method from the client to the server tells the resource to
   stop recognition if a request is active.  If a RECOGNIZE request is
   active and the "STOP" request successfully terminated it, then the
   response header contains an active-request-id-list header containing
   the request-id of the RECOGNIZE request that was terminated.  In this
   case, no RECOGNITION-COMPLETE event is sent for the terminated
   request.  If there was no recognition active, then the response MUST
   NOT contain an active-request-id-list header.  Either way the
   response MUST contain a status of 200 (Success).

9.11.  GET-RESULT

   The GET-RESULT method from the client to the server may be issued
   when the recognizer resource is in the recognized state.  This
   request allows the client to retrieve results for a completed
   recognition.  This is useful if the client decides it wants more
   alternatives or more information.  When the server receives this

   request it re-computes and returns the results according to the
   recognition constraints provided in the GET-RESULT request.

   The GET-RESULT request can specify constraints such as a different
   confidence-threshold, or n-best-list-length.  This capability is
   optional for MRCPv2 servers and the automatic speech recognition
   engine in the server MAY return a status of unsupported feature.

9.12.  START-OF-INPUT

   This is an event from the server to the client indicating that the
   recognition resource has detected speech or a DTMF digit in the media
   stream.  This event is useful in implementing kill-on-barge-in
   scenarios when a synthesizer resource is in a different session from
   the recognizer resource and hence is not aware of an incoming audio
   source.  In these cases, it is up to the client to act as a
   intermediary and respond to this event by issuing a BARGE-IN-OCCURRED
   event to the synthesizer resource.  The recognizer resource also MUST
   send a Proxy-Sync-Id header with a unique value for this event.

   This event MUST be generated by the server irrespective of whether
   the synthesizer and recognizer are on the same server or not.

9.13.  START-INPUT-TIMERS

   This request is sent from the client to the recognition resource when
   it knows that a kill-on-barge-in prompt has finished playing.  This
   is useful in the scenario when the recognition and synthesizer
   engines are not in the same session.  When a kill-on-barge-in prompt
   is being played, the client may want a RECOGNIZE request to be
   simultaneously active so that it can detect and implement kill on
   barge-in.  But at the same time the client doesn't want the
   recognizer to start the no-input timers until the prompt is finished.
   The Start-Input-Timers header in the RECOGNIZE request allows the
   client to say whether the timers should be started immediately or
   not.  If not, the recognizer resource MUST NOT start the timers until
   the client sends a START-INPUT-TIMERS method to the recognizer.

9.14.  RECOGNITION-COMPLETE

   This is an Event from the recognizer resource to the client
   indicating that the recognition completed.  The recognition result is
   sent in the body of the MRCPv2 message.  The request-state field MUST
   be COMPLETE indicating that this is the last event with that
   request-id, and that the request with that request-id is now
   complete.  The server MUST maintain the recognizer context containing
   the results and the audio waveform input of that recognition until
   the next RECOGNIZE request is issued for that resource or the session
   terminates.  A URI to the audio waveform MAY be returned to the
   client in a Waveform-URI header in the RECOGNITION-COMPLETE event.
   The client can use this URI to retrieve or playback the audio.

   Note if an enrollment session was active, the RECOGNITION-COMPLETE
   event can contain either recognition or enrollment results depending
   on what was spoken.

9.15.  START-PHRASE-ENROLLMENT

   The START-PHRASE-ENROLLMENT method from the client to the server
   starts a new phrase enrollment session during which the client may
   call RECOGNIZE multiple times to enroll a new utterance in a grammar.
   An enrollment session consists of a set of calls to RECOGNIZE in
   which the caller speaks a phrase several times so the system can
   "learn" it.  The phrase is then added to a personal grammar (speaker-
   trained grammar), so that the system can recognize it later.

   Only one phrase enrollment session may be active at a time for a
   resource.  The Personal-Grammar-URI identifies the grammar that is
   used during enrollment to store the personal list of phrases.  Once
   RECOGNIZE is called, the result is returned in a RECOGNITION-COMPLETE
   event and may contain either an enrollment result OR a recognition
   result for a regular recognition.

Internet-Draft                   MRCPv2                      August 2009


   Calling END-PHRASE-ENROLLMENT ends the ongoing phrase enrollment
   session, which is typically done after a sequence of successful calls
   to RECOGNIZE.  This method can be called to commit the new phrase to
   the personal grammar or to abort the phrase enrollment session.

   The Personal-Grammar-URI, which specifies the grammar to contain the
   new enrolled phrase, is created if it does not exist.  Also, the
   personal grammar may ONLY contain phrases added via a phrase
   enrollment session.

   The Phrase-ID passed to this method is used to identify this phrase
   in the grammar and will be returned as the speech input when doing a
   RECOGNIZE on the grammar.  The Phrase-NL similarly is returned in a
   RECOGNITION-COMPLETE event in the same manner as other NL in a
   grammar.  The tag-format of this NL is implementation specific.

   If the client has specified Save-Best-Waveform as true, then the
   response after ending the phrase enrollment session MUST contain the
   location/URI of a recording of the best repetition of the learned
   phrase.

9.16.  ENROLLMENT-ROLLBACK

   The ENROLLMENT-ROLLBACK method discards the last live utterance from
   the RECOGNIZE operation.  The client can invoke this method when the
   caller provides undesirable input such as non-speech noises, side-
   speech, commands, utterance from the RECOGNIZE grammar, etc.  Note
   that this method does not provide a stack of rollback states.
   Executing ENROLLMENT-ROLLBACK twice in succession without an
   intervening recognition operation has no effect the second time.

9.17.  END-PHRASE-ENROLLMENT

   The END-PHRASE-ENROLLMENT method may be called ONLY during an active
   phrase enrollment session.  It MUST NOT be called during an ongoing
   RECOGNIZE operation.  To commit the new phrase in the grammar, the
   client MAY call this method once successive calls to RECOGNIZE have
   succeeded and Num-Repetitions-Still-Needed has been returned as 0 in
   the RECOGNITION-COMPLETE event.  Alternatively, the client can abort
   the phrase enrollment session by calling this method with the Abort-
   Phrase-Enrollment header.

   If the client has specified Save-Best-Waveform as true in the START-
   PHRASE-ENROLLMENT request, then the response MUST contain the
   location/URI of a recording of the best repetition of the learned
   phrase.

9.20.  INTERPRET

   The INTERPRET method from the client to the server takes as input an
   interpret-text header containing the text for which the semantic
   interpretation is desired, and returns, via the INTERPRETATION-
   COMPLETE event, an interpretation result which is very similar to the
   one returned from a RECOGNIZE method invocation.  Only portions of
   the result relevant to acoustic matching are excluded from the
   result.  The interpret-text header MUST be included in the INTERPRET
   request.

   Recognizer grammar data is treated in the same way as it is when
   issuing a RECOGNIZE method call.

   If a RECOGNIZE, RECORD or another INTERPRET operation is already in
   progress for the resource, the server MUST reject the request a
   response having a status code of 402, "Method not valid in this
   state", and a COMPLETE request state.

9.22.  DTMF Detection

   Digits received as DTMF tones are delivered to the recognition
   resource in the MRCPv2 server in the RTP stream according to RFC4733
   [RFC4733].  The automatic speech recognizer (ASR) MUST support
   RFC4733 to recognize digits and it MAY support recognizing DTMF tones
   [Q.23] in the audio.


10.  Recorder Resource

   This resource captures received audio and video and stores it as
   content pointed to by a URI.  The main usages of recorders are
   1.  to capture speech audio that may be submitted for recognition at
       a later time, and
   2.  recording voice or video mails.
   Both these applications require functionality above and beyond those
   specified by protocols such as RTSP.  This includes Audio endpointing
   (i.e., detecting speech or silence).  The support for video is
   optional and is mainly capturing video mails that may require the
   speech or audio processing mentioned above.

   A recorder MUST provide some endpointing capabilities for suppressing
   silence at the beginning and end of a recording, and MAY also
   suppress silence in the middle of a recording.  If such suppression
   is done, the recorder MUST maintain timing metadata to indicate the
   actual time stamps of the recorded media.

10.2.  Recorder Methods

   The recorder resource supports the following methods.

   recorder-Method      =  "RECORD"
                        /  "STOP"
                        /  "START-INPUT-TIMERS"

10.3.  Recorder Events

   The recorder resource may generate the following events.

   recorder-Event       =  "START-OF-INPUT"
                        /  "RECORD-COMPLETE"

10.4.  Recorder Header Fields

   Method invocations for the recorder resource may contain resource-
   specific headers containing request options and information to
   augment the Method, Response or Event message it is associated with.

                        /  new-audio-channel

10.4.1.  Sensitivity Level

   To filter out background noise and not mistake it for speech, the
   recorder may support a variable level of sound sensitivity.  The
   sensitivity-level header is a float value between 0.0 and 1.0 and
   allows the client to set the sensitivity level for the recorder.
   This header MAY occur in RECORD, "SET-PARAMS" or "GET-PARAMS".  A
   higher value for this header means higher sensitivity.  The default
   value for this header is implementation specific.

   sensitivity-level    =     "Sensitivity-Level" ":" FLOAT CRLF

10.4.2.  No Input Timeout

   When recording is started and there is no speech detected for a
   certain period of time, the recorder can send a RECORD-COMPLETE event
   to the client and terminate the record operation.  The no-input-
   timeout header can set this timeout value.  The value is in
   milliseconds.  This header MAY occur in RECORD, "SET-PARAMS" or
   "GET-PARAMS".  The value for this header ranges from 0 to an
   implementation specific maximum value.  The default value for this
   header is implementation specific.

   no-input-timeout    =     "No-Input-Timeout" ":" 1*19DIGIT CRLF

10.4.3.  Completion Cause

   This header MUST be part of a RECORD-COMPLETE event from the recorder
   resource to the client.  This indicates the reason behind the RECORD
   method completion.  This header MUST be sent in the RECORD responses
   if they return with a failure status and a COMPLETE state.

   +------------+-----------------------+------------------------------+

10.4.4.  Completion Reason

   This header MAY be present in a RECORD-COMPLETE event coming from the
   recorder resource to the client.  It contains the reason text behind
   the RECORD request completion.  This header communicates text
   describing the reason for the failure.

   The completion reason text is provided for client use in logs and for
   debugging and instrumentation purposes.  Clients MUST NOT interpret
   the completion reason text.

   completion-reason        =  "Completion-Reason" ":"
                               quoted-string CRLF

10.4.5.  Failed URI

   When a recorder method needs to post the audio to a URI and access to
   the URI fails, the server MUST provide the failed URI in this header
   in the method response.

   failed-uri               =  "Failed-URI" ":" Uri CRLF

10.4.6.  Failed URI Cause

   When a recorder method needs to post the audio to a URI and access to
   the URI fails, the server MUST provide the URI specific or protocol
   specific response code through this header in the method response.

   The value encoding is UTF-8 to accommodate any access protocol, some
   of which might have a response string instead of a numeric response
   code.

   failed-uri-cause         =  "Failed-URI-Cause" ":" 1*UTFCHAR
                               CRLF

10.4.7.  Record URI

   When a recorder method contains this header the server must capture
   the audio and store it.  If the header is present but specified with
   no value, the server MUST store the content locally and generate a
   URI that points to it.  This URI is then returned in either the
   "STOP" response or the RECORD-COMPLETE event.  If the header in the
   RECORD method specifies a URI, the server MUST attempt to capture and
   store the audio at that location.  If this header is not specified in
   the RECORD request, the server MUST capture the audio and send it in
   the "STOP" response or the RECORD-COMPLETE event as a message body.
   In this case, the response carrying the audio content would have this
   header with a cid value pointing to the Content-ID in the message
   body.

   The server MUST also return the size in bytes and the duration in
   milliseconds of the recorded audio wave-form as parameters associated
   with the header.

   record-uri               =  "Record-URI" ":" ["<" Uri ">"
                               ";" "size" "=" 1*19DIGIT
                               ";" "duration" "=" 1*19DIGIT] CRLF

10.4.8.  Media Type

   A RECORD method MUST contain this header, which specifies to the
   server the Media Type of the captured audio or video.

   media-type               =  "Media-Type" ":" media-type-value
                               CRLF

10.4.9.  Max Time

   When recording is started this specifies the maximum length of the
   recording in milliseconds, calculated from the time the actual
   capture and store begins and is not necessarily the time the RECORD
   method is received.  It specifies the duration before silence
   suppression, if any, has been applied by the recorder resource.
   After this time, the recording stops and the server MUST return a
   RECORD-COMPLETE event to the client having a request-state of
   "COMPLETE".  This header MAY occur in RECORD, "SET-PARAMS" or



Shanmugham & Burnett    Expires February 12, 2010             [Page 130]

Internet-Draft                   MRCPv2                      August 2009


   "GET-PARAMS".  The value for this header ranges from 0 to an
   implementation specific maximum value.  A value of zero means
   infinity and hence the recording continues until one or more of the
   other stop conditions are met.  The default value for this header is
   0.

   max-time                 =  "Max-Time" ":" 1*19DIGIT CRLF

10.4.10.  Trim-Length

   This header MAY be sent on a STOP method and specifies the length of
   audio to be trimmed from the end of the recording after the stop.
   The length is interpreted to be in milliseconds.  The default value
   for this header is 0.

   trim-length                 =  "Trim-Length" ":" 1*19DIGIT CRLF

10.4.11.  Final Silence

   When recorder is started and the actual capture begins, this header
   specifies the length of silence in the audio that is to be
   interpreted as the end of the recording.  This header MAY occur in
   RECORD, "SET-PARAMS" or "GET-PARAMS".  The value for this header
   ranges from 0 to an implementation specific maximum value and is
   interpreted to be in milliseconds.  A value of zero means infinity
   and hence the recording will continue until one of the other stop
   conditions are met.  The default value for this header is
   implementation specific.

   final-silence            =  "Final-Silence" ":" 1*19DIGIT CRLF

10.4.12.  Capture On Speech

   If false, the recorder MUST start capturing immediately when started.
   If true, the recorder MUST wait for the endpointing functionality to
   detect speech before it starts capturing.  This header MAY occur in
   the RECORD, "SET-PARAMS" or "GET-PARAMS".  The value for this header
   is a Boolean.  The default value for this header is false.

   capture-on-speech        =  "Capture-On-Speech " ":" BOOLEAN CRLF

10.4.13.  Ver-Buffer-Utterance

   This header is the same as the one described for the Verification
   resource (see Section 11.4.14).  This tells the server to buffer the
   utterance associated with this recording request into the
   verification buffer.  Sending this header is permitted only if the
   verification buffer is for the session.  This buffer is shared across

   resources within a session.  It gets instantiated when a verification
   resource is added to this session and is released when the
   verification resource is released from the session.

10.4.14.  Start Input Timers

   This header MAY be sent as part of the RECORD request.  A value of
   false tells the recorder resource to start the operation, but not to
   start the no-input timer until the client sends a START-INPUT-TIMERS
   request to the recorder resource.  This is useful in the scenario
   when the recorder and synthesizer resources are not part of the same
   session.  When a kill-on-barge-in prompt is being played, the client
   may want the RECORD request to be simultaneously active so that it
   can detect and implement kill-on-barge-in.  But at the same time the
   client doesn't want the recorder resource to start the no-input
   timers until the prompt is finished.  The default value is "true".

   start-input-timers       =  "Start-Input-Timers" ":"
                               BOOLEAN CRLF

10.4.15.  New Audio Channel

   This header is the same as the one described for the Recognizer
   resource (see Section 9.4.23).

10.5.  Recorder Message Body

   If the RECORD request did not have a Record-Uri header, the "STOP"
   response or the RECORD-COMPLETE event MUST contain a message body
   carrying the captured audio.  In this case, the message carrying the
   audio content has a Record-Uri header with a cid value pointing to
   the message body entity that contains the recorded audio.

10.6.  RECORD

   The RECORD request places the recorder resource in the Recording
   state.  Depending on the headers specified in the RECORD method, the
   resource may start recording the audio immediately or wait for the
   end pointing functionality to detect speech in the audio.  The audio
   is then made available to the client either in the message body or as
   specified by Record-URI.

   The server MUST support the HTTPS URI scheme and MAY support other
   schemes.  Note that due to the sensitive nature of voice recordings,
   any protocols used for dereferencing SHOULD employ integrity and
   confidentiality.

   If a RECORD operation is already in progress, invoking this method

   causes the server to issue a response having a status code of 402,
   "Method not valid in this state", and a COMPLETE request state.

   If the recording-uri is not valid, a status code of 404, "Illegal
   Value for Header", is returned in the response.  If it is impossible
   for the server to create the requested stored content, a status code
   of 407, "Method or Operation Failed", is returned.

   If the type specified in the Media-Type header is not supported, the
   server MUST respond with a status code of 409, "Unsupported Header
   Value", with the Media-Type header in its response.

   When the recording operation is initiated, the response indicates an
   IN-PROGRESS request state.  The server MAY generate a subsequent
   START-OF-INPUT event when speech is detected.  Upon completion of the
   recording operation, the server generates a RECORD-COMPLETE event.

10.7.  STOP

   The "STOP" method moves the recorder from the recording state back to
   the idle state.  If a RECORD request is active and the "STOP" request
   successfully terminated it, then the STOP response MUST contain an
   active-request-id-list header containing the "RECORD" request-id that
   was terminated.  In this case, no RECORD-COMPLETE event is sent for
   the terminated request.  If there was no recording active, then the
   response MUST NOT contain an active-request-id-list header.  If the
   recording was a success the "STOP" response MUST contain a Record-URI

   header pointing to the recorded audio content or to an typed entity
   in the body of the "STOP" response containing the recorded audio.
   The "STOP" method may have a Trim-Length header, in which case the
   specified length of audio is trimmed from the end of the recording
   after the stop.  In any case, the response MUST contain a status of
   200 (Success).

10.9.  START-INPUT-TIMERS

   This request is sent from the client to the recorder resource when it
   discovers that a kill-on-barge-in prompt has finished playing.  This
   is useful in the scenario when the recorder and synthesizer resources
   are not in the same MRCPv2 session.  When a kill-on-barge-in prompt
   is being played, the client wants the RECORD request to be
   simultaneously active so that it can detect and implement kill on
   barge-in.  But at the same time the client doesn't want the recorder
   resource to start the no-input timers until the prompt is finished.
   The Start-Input-Timers header in the RECORD request allows the client
   to say if the timers should be started or not.  In the above case the
   recorder resource does not start the timers until the client sends a
   START-INPUT-TIMERS method to the recorder.

10.10.  START-OF-INPUT

   The START-OF-INPUT event is returned from the server to the client
   once the server has detected speech.  This event is always returned
   by the recording resource when speech has been detected.  The
   recorder resource also MUST send a Proxy-Sync-Id header with a unique
   value for this event.

11.  Speaker Verification and Identification

   This section describes the methods, responses and events employed by
   MRCPv2 for doing Speaker Verification / Identification.

   Speaker verification is a voice authentication methodology that can
   be used to identify the speaker in order to grant the user access to
   sensitive information and transactions.  Because speech is a
   biometric, a number of essential security considerations related to
   biometric authentication technologies apply to its implementation and
   usage.  Implementers should carefully read Section 12 in this
   document and the corresponding section of Speechsc Requirements
   [RFC4313].

   In speaker verification, a recorded utterance is compared to a
   previously stored voiceprint which is in turn associated with a
   claimed identity for that user.  Verification typically consists of
   two phases: a designation phase to establish the claimed identity of
   the caller and an execution phase in which a voiceprint is either
   created (training) or used to authenticate the claimed identity
   (verification).

   Speaker identification is the process of associating an unknown
   speaker with a member in a population.  It does not employ a claim of
   identity.  When an individual claims to belong to a group (e.g., one
   of the owners of a joint bank account) a group authentication is
   performed.  This is generally implemented as a kind of verification
   involving comparison with more than one voice model.  It is sometimes
   called 'multi-verification.'  If the individual speaker can be
   identified from the group, this may be useful for applications where
   multiple users share the same access privileges to some data or
   application.  Speaker identification and group authentication are
   also done in two phases, a designation phase and an execution phase.
   Note that from a functionality standpoint identification can be
   thought of as a special case of group authentication (if the
   individual is identified) where the group is the entire population,
   although the implementation of speaker identification may be
   different from the way group authentication is performed.  To
   accommodate single-voiceprint verification, verification against
   multiple voiceprints, group authentication, and identification, this
   specification provides a single set of methods that can take a list
   of identifiers, called "voiceprint identifiers", and return a list of
   identifiers, with a score for each representing how well the input
   speech matched each identifier.  The input and output lists of
   identifiers do not have to match, allowing a vendor-specific group
   identifier to be used as input to indicate that identification is to
   be performed.  In this specification, the terms "Identification" and
   "Multi-verification" are used to indicate that the input represents a

   group (potentially the entire population) and that results for
   multiple voiceprints may be returned.

   It is possible for a speaker verification resource to share the same
   session with a recognizer resource or to operate independently.  In
   order to share the same session, the verification and recognizer
   resources MUST be allocated from within the same SIP dialog.
   Otherwise, an independent verification resource, running on the same
   physical server or a separate one, will be set up.  Note that in
   addition to allowing both resources to be allocated in the same
   INVITE, it is possible to allocate one initially and the other later
   via a re-INVITE.

   Some of the speaker verification methods, described below, apply only
   to a specific mode of operation.

   The verification resource has a verification buffer associated with
   it (see Section 11.4.14).  This allows the storage of speech
   utterances for the purposes of verification, identification or
   training from the buffered speech.  This buffer is owned by the
   verification resource but other input resources such as the
   recognition resource or recorder resource may write to it.  This
   allows the speech received as part of a recognition or recording
   operation to be later used for verification, identification or
   training.  Access to the buffer is limited to one operation at time.
   Hence when the resource is doing read, write or delete operation such
   as a RECOGNIZE with ver-buffer-utterance turned on, another operation
   involving the buffer fails with a status of 402.  The verification
   buffer can be cleared by a CLEAR-BUFFER request from the client and
   is freed when the verification resource is deallocated or the session
   with the server terminates.

   The verification buffer is different from collecting waveforms and
   processing them using either the real time audio stream or stored
   audio, because this buffering mechanism does not simply accumulate
   speech to a buffer.  The verification buffer may contain additional
   information gathered by the recognition resource that serves to
   improve verification performance.

11.1.  Speaker Verification State Machine

   Speaker verification may operate in a training or a verification
   session.  Starting one of these sessions does not change the state of
   the verification resource, i.e. it remains idle.  Once a verification
   or training session is started, then utterances are trained or
   verified by calling the VERIFY or VERIFY-FROM-BUFFER method.  The
   state of the verification resources goes from IDLE to VERIFYING state
   each time VERIFY or VERIFY-FROM-BUFFER is called.

11.2.  Speaker Verification Methods

   The verification resource supports the following methods.

   verification-method      =  "START-SESSION"
                            / "END-SESSION"
                            / "QUERY-VOICEPRINT"
                            / "DELETE-VOICEPRINT"
                            / "VERIFY"
                            / "VERIFY-FROM-BUFFER"
                            / "VERIFY-ROLLBACK"
                            / "STOP"
                            / "CLEAR-BUFFER"
                            / "START-INPUT-TIMERS"
                            / "GET-INTERMEDIATE-RESULT"

   These methods allow the client to control the mode and target of
   verification or identification operations within the context of a
   session.  All the verification input operations that occur within a
   session may be used to create, update, or validate against the
   voiceprint specified during the session.  At the beginning of each
   session the verification resource is reset to the state it had prior
   to any previous verification session.

   Verification/identification operations can be executed against live
   or buffered audio.  The verification resource provides methods for
   collecting and evaluating live audio data, and methods for
   controlling the verification resource and adjusting its configured

   behavior.

   There are no dedicated methods for collecting buffered audio data.
   This is accomplished by calling VERIFY, RECOGNIZE or RECORD as
   appropriate for the resource, with the header ver-buffer-utterance.
   Then, when the following method is called verification is performed
   using the set of buffered audio.
   1.  VERIFY-FROM-BUFFER

   The following methods are used for verification of live audio
   utterances :
   1.  VERIFY
   2.  START-INPUT-TIMERS

   The following methods are used for configuring the verification
   resource and for establishing resource states :
   1.  START-SESSION
   2.  END-SESSION
   3.  QUERY-VOICEPRINT
   4.  DELETE-VOICEPRINT
   5.  VERIFY-ROLLBACK
   6.  "STOP"
   7.  CLEAR-BUFFER

   The following method allows the polling a Verification in progress
   for intermediate results.
   1.  GET-INTERMEDIATE-RESULT

11.3.  Verification Events

   The verification resource generates the following events.

   verification-event       =  "VERIFICATION-COMPLETE"
                            /  "START-OF-INPUT"

11.4.  Verification Header Fields

   A verification resource message may contain headers containing
   request options and information to augment the Request, Response or
   Event message it is associated with.

11.4.1.  Repository-URI

   This header specifies the voiceprint repository to be used or
   referenced during speaker verification or identification operations.
   This header is required in the START-SESSION, QUERY-VOICEPRINT and
   DELETE-VOICEPRINT methods.

   repository-uri           =  "Repository-URI" ":" Uri CRLF

11.4.2.  Voiceprint-Identifier

   This header specifies the claimed identity for verification
   applications.  The claimed identity may be used to specify an
   existing voiceprint or to establish a new voiceprint.  This header is
   required in the QUERY-VOICEPRINT and DELETE-VOICEPRINT methods.  The
   Voiceprint-Identifier is required in the START-SESSION method for
   verification operations.  For Identification or Multi-Verification
   operations this header may contain a list of voiceprint identifiers
   separated by semi-colons.  For identification operations the client
   can also specify a voiceprint group identifier instead of a list of
   voiceprint identifiers.

   voiceprint-identifier        =  "Voiceprint-Identifier" ":"
                                   1*VCHAR "." 1*VCHAR

11.4.3.  Verification-Mode

   This header specifies the mode of the verification resource and is
   set by the START-SESSION method.  Acceptable values indicate whether
   the verification session will train a voiceprint ("train") or verify/
   identify using an existing voiceprint ("verify").

   Training and verification sessions both require the voiceprint
   Repository-URI to be specified in the START-SESSION.  In many usage
   scenarios, however, the system does not know the speaker's claimed
   identity until a recognition operation has, for example, recognized
   an account number to which the user desires access.  In order to
   allow the first few utterances of a dialog to be both recognized and
   verified, the verification resource on the MRCPv2 server retains a
   buffer.  In this buffer, the MRCPv2 server accumulates recognized
   utterances.  The client can later execute a verification method and
   apply the buffered utterances to the current verification session.

   Some voice user interfaces may require additional user input that
   should not be subject to verification.  For example, the user's input
   may have been recognized with low confidence and thus require a
   confirmation cycle.  In such cases, the client should not execute the
   VERIFY or VERIFY-FROM-BUFFER methods to collect and analyze the
   caller's input.  A separate recognizer resource can analyze the
   caller's response without any participation by the verification
   resource.

   Once the following conditions have been met:
   1.  Voiceprint identity has been successfully established through the
       voiceprint identifier headers of the START-SESSION method, and
   2.  the verification mode has been set to one of "train" or "verify",
   the verification resource may begin providing verification
   information during verification operations.  If the verification
   resource does not reach one of the two major states ("train" or
   "verify") , it MUST report an error condition in the MRCPv2 status
   code to indicate why the verification resource is not ready for the
   corresponding usage.

   The value of verification-mode is persistent within a verification
   session.  If the client attempts to change the mode during a
   verification session, the verification resource reports an error and
   the mode retains its current value.

   verification-mode            =  "Verification-Mode" ":"
                                   verification-mode-string

   verification-mode-string     =  "train"

11.4.4.  Adapt-Model

   This header indicates the desired behavior of the verification
   resource after a successful verification operation.  If the value of
   this header is "true", the sever SHOULD use audio collected during
   the verification session to update the voiceprint to account for
   ongoing changes in a speaker's incoming speech characteristics,
   unless local policy prohibits updating the voiceprint.  If the value
   is "false" (the default), the server MUST NOT update the voiceprint.
   This header MAY occur in the START-SESSION method.

   adapt-model              = "Adapt-Model" ":" BOOLEAN CRLF

11.4.5.  Abort-Model

   The Abort-Model header indicates the desired behavior of the
   verification resource upon session termination.  If the value of this
   header is "true", the server MUST discard any pending changes to a
   voiceprint due to verification training or verification adaptation.
   If the value is "false" (the default), the server MUST commit any
   pending changes for a training session or a successful verification
   session to the voiceprint repository.  A value of "true" for Abort-
   Model overrides a value of "true" for the Adapt-Model header.  This
   header MAY occur in the END-SESSION method.

   abort-model             = "Abort-Model" ":" BOOLEAN CRLF

11.4.6.  Min-Verification-Score

   The Min-Verification-Score header, when used with a verification
   resource through a "SET-PARAMS", "GET-PARAMS" or START-SESSION
   method, determines the minimum verification score for which a
   verification decision of "accepted" may be declared by the server.
   This is a float value between -1.0 and 1.0 that determines the
   minimum verification score for which a verification decision of
   "accepted" may be declared by the server.  The default value for this
   header is implementation specific.

   min-verification-score  = "Min-Verification-Score" ":"
                             [ %x2D ] FLOAT CRLF

11.4.7.  Num-Min-Verification-Phrases

   The Num-Min-Verification-Phrases header is used to specify the
   minimum number of valid utterances before a positive decision is
   given for verification.  The value for this header is an integer and
   the default value is 1.  The verification resource MUST NOT declare a
   verification 'accepted' unless Num-Min-Verification-Phrases valid

11.4.8.  Num-Max-Verification-Phrases

   The Num-Max-Verification-Phrases header is used to specify the number
   of valid utterances required before a decision is forced for
   verification.  The verification resource MUST NOT return a decision
   of 'undecided' once Num-Max-Verification-Phrases have been collected
   and used to determine a verification score.  The value for this
   header is an integer and the minimum value is 1.  The default value
   is implementation-specific.  This header MAY occur in START-SESSION,
   "SET-PARAMS" or "GET-PARAMS".

   num-max-verification-phrases =  "Num-Max-Verification-Phrases" ":"
                                    1*19DIGIT CRLF

11.4.9.  No-Input-Timeout

   The No-Input-Timeout header sets the length of time from the start of
   the verification timers (see START-INPUT-TIMERS) until the
   declaration of a no-input event in the VERIFICATION-COMPLETE server
   event message.  The value is in milliseconds.  This header MAY occur
   in VERIFY, "SET-PARAMS" or "GET-PARAMS".  The value for this header
   ranges from 0 to an implementation specific maximum value.  The
   default value for this header is implementation specific.

   no-input-timeout         = "No-Input-Timeout" ":" 1*19DIGIT CRLF

11.4.10.  Save-Waveform

   This header allows the client to request the verification resource to
   save the audio stream that was used for verification/identification.
   The verification resource MUST attempt to record the audio and make
   it available to the client in the form of a URI returned in the
   Waveform-URI header in the VERIFICATION-COMPLETE event.  If there was
   an error in recording the stream or the audio content is otherwise
   not available, the verification resource MUST return an empty
   Waveform-URI header.  The default value for this header is "false".
   This header MAY appear in the VERIFY method.  Note that this header
   does not appear in the VERIFY-FROM-BUFFER method since it only
   controls whether or not to save the waveform for live verification /
   identification operations.

   save-waveform            =  "Save-Waveform" ":" BOOLEAN CRLF

11.4.11.  Media Type

   This header MAY be specified in the SET-PARAMS, GET-PARAMS or the
   VERIFY methods and tells the server resource the Media Type of the
   captured audio or video such as the one captured and returned by the
   Waveform-URI header.

   media-type               =  "Media-Type" ":" media-type-value
                               CRLF

11.4.12.  Waveform-URI

   If the Save-Waveform header is set to true, the verification resource
   MUST attempt to record the incoming audio stream of the verification
   into a file and provide a URI for the client to access it.  This
   header MUST be present in the VERIFICATION-COMPLETE event if the
   Save-Waveform header was set to true by the client.  The value of the
   header MUST be empty if there was some error condition preventing the
   server from recording.  Otherwise, the URI generated by the server
   MUST be globally unique across the server and all its verification
   sessions.  The content MUST be available via the URI until the
   verification session ends.  Since the Save-Waveform header applies
   only to live verification / identification operations, the server can
   return the Waveform-URI only in the VERIFICATION-COMPLETE event for
   live verification / identification operations.

   The server MUST also return the size in bytes and the duration in
   milliseconds of the recorded audio wave-form as parameters associated
   with the header.

   waveform-uri             =  "Waveform-URI" ":" ["<" Uri ">"

11.4.13.  Voiceprint-Exists

   This header MUST be returned in QUERY-VOICEPRINT and DELETE-
   VOICEPRINT responses.  This is the status of the voiceprint specified
   in the QUERY-VOICEPRINT method.  For the DELETE-VOICEPRINT method
   this header indicates the status of the voiceprint at the moment the
   method execution started.

   voiceprint-exists    =  "Voiceprint-Exists" ":" BOOLEAN CRLF

11.4.14.  Ver-Buffer-Utterance

   This header is used to indicate that this utterance could be later
   considered for Speaker Verification.  This way, a client can request
   the server to buffer utterances while doing regular recognition or
   verification activities and speaker verification can later be
   requested on the buffered utterances.  This header is OPTIONAL in the
   RECOGNIZE, VERIFY and RECORD methods.  The default value for this
   header is "false".

   ver-buffer-utterance     = "Ver-Buffer-Utterance" ":" BOOLEAN
                              CRLF

11.4.15.  Input-Waveform-Uri

   This header specifies stored audio content that the client requests
   the server to fetch and process according to the current verification
   mode, either to train the voiceprint or verify a claimed identity.
   This header enables the client to implement the buffering use case
   where the recognizer and verification resources are in different
   sessions and the verification buffer technique cannot be used.  It
   MAY be specified on the VERIFY request.

   input-waveform-uri           =  "Input-Waveform-URI" ":" Uri CRLF

11.4.16.  Completion-Cause

   This header MUST be part of a VERIFICATION-COMPLETE event from the
   verification resource to the client.  This indicates the cause of
   VERIFY or VERIFY-FROM-BUFFER method completion.  This header MUST be
   sent in the VERIFY, VERIFY-FROM-BUFFER, and QUERY-VOICEPRINT
   responses, if they return with a failure status and a COMPLETE state.

   MUST NOT start the timers until the client sends a START-INPUT-TIMERS
   request to the resource.  This is useful in the scenario when the
   verifier and synthesizer resources are not part of the same session.
   In this scenario, when a kill-on-barge-in prompt is being played, the
   client may want the VERIFY request to be simultaneously active so
   that it can detect and implement kill-on-barge-in.  But at the same
   time the client doesn't want the verification resource to start the
   no-input timers until the prompt is finished.  The default value is
   "true".

   start-input-timers       =  "Start-Input-Timers" ":"
                               BOOLEAN CRLF

11.5.  Verification Message Body

   A verification response or event message may carry additional data as
   described in the following subsection.

11.5.1.  Verification Result Data

   Verification results are returned to the client in the message body
   of the VERIFICATION-COMPLETE event or the GET-INTERMEDIATE-RESULT
   response message as described in Section 6.3).  Element and attribute
   descriptions for the verification portion of the NLSML format are
   provided in Section 11.5.2 with a normative definition of the schema
   in Section 16.3.

11.5.2.  Verification Result Elements

   All verification elements are contained within a single
   <verification-result> element under <result>.  The elements are
   described below and have the schema defined in Section 16.2.  The
   following elements are defined:

   1.   Voiceprint
   2.   Incremental
   3.   Cumulative
   4.   Decision
   5.   Utterance-Length
   6.   Device
   7.   Gender
   8.   Adapted
   9.   Verification-Score
   10.  Vendor-Specific-Results

11.5.2.1.  Voiceprint

   This element in the verification results provides information on how
   the speech data matched a single voiceprint.  The result data
   returned may have more than one such entity in the case of
   Identification or Multi-Verification.  Each "<voiceprint>" element
   and the XML data within the element describe verification result
   information for how well the speech data matched that particular
   voiceprint.  The list of voiceprint element data are ordered
   according to their cumulative verification match scores, with the
   highest score first.

11.5.2.2.  Cumulative

   Within each "<voiceprint>" element there MUST be a "<cumulative>"
   element with the cumulative scores of how well multiple utterances
   matched the voiceprint.

11.5.2.3.  Incremental

   The first "<voiceprint>" element MAY contain an "<incremental>"
   element with the incremental scores of how well the last utterance
   matched the voiceprint.

11.5.2.4.  Decision

   This element is found within the "<incremental>" or "<cumulative>"
   element within the verification results.  Its value indicates the
   verification decision.  It can have the values of "accepted",
   "rejected" or "undecided".

11.5.2.5.  Utterance-Length

   This element MAY occur within either the "<incremental>" or
   "<cumulative>" elements within the first "<voiceprint>" element.  Its
   value indicates the size in milliseconds, respectively, of the last
   utterance or the cumulated set of utterances.

11.5.2.6.  Device

   This element is found within the incremental or cumulative element
   within the verification results.  Its value indicates the apparent
   type of device used by the caller as determined by the verification
   resource.  It can have the values of "cellular-phone", "electret-
   phone", "carbon-button-phone", or "unknown".

11.5.2.7.  Gender

   This element is found within the incremental or cumulative element
   within the verification results.  Its value indicates the apparent
   gender of the speaker as determined by the verification resource.  It
   can have the values of "male", "female" or "unknown".

11.5.2.8.  Adapted

   This element is found within the first "<voiceprint>" element within
   the verification results.  When verification is trying to confirm the
   voiceprint, this indicates if the voiceprint has been adapted as a
   consequence of analyzing the source utterances.  It is not returned
   during verification training.  The value can be "true" or "false".

11.5.2.9.  Verification-Score

   This element is found within the incremental or cumulative element
   within the verification results.  Its value indicates the score of
   the last utterance as determined by verification.

   During verification, the higher the score the more likely it is that
   the speaker is the same one as the one who spoke the voiceprint
   utterances.  During training, the higher the score the more likely
   the speaker is to have spoken all of the analyzed utterances.  The
   value is a floating point between -1.0 and 1.0.  If there are no such
   utterances the score is -1.  Note that the verification score is not
   a probability value.

11.5.2.10.  Vendor-Specific-Results

   Verification results may contain implementation specific data which
   augment the information provided by the MRCPv2-defined elements.
   These may be useful to clients who have private knowledge of how to
   interpret these schema extensions.  Implementation specific additions
   to the verification results schema MUST belong to the vendor's own
   namespace.  In the result structure, they must either be indicated by
   a namespace prefix declared within the result or must be children of
   an element identified as belonging to the respective namespace.

   The following example shows the results of three voiceprints.  Note
   that the first one has crossed the verification score threshold, and
   the speaker has been accepted.  The voiceprint was also adapted with
   the most recent utterance.

                      Verification Results Example 2

11.6.  START-SESSION

   The START-SESSION method starts a Speaker Verification or
   Identification session.  Execution of this method places the
   verification resource into its initial state.  If this method is
   called during an ongoing verification session, the previous session
   is implicitly aborted.  If this method is invoked when VERIFY or
   VERIFY-FROM-BUFFER is active, the method fails and the server returns
   a status code of 402.

   Upon completion of the START-SESSION method, the verification
   resource MUST have terminated any ongoing verification session, and
   cleared any voiceprint designation.

   A verification session is associated with the voiceprint repository
   to be used during the session.  This is specified through the
   "Repository-URI" header (see Section 11.4.1).

   The START-SESSION method also establishes, through the Voiceprint-
   Identifier header, which voiceprints are to be matched or trained
   during the verification session.  If this is an Identification

   session or if the client wants to do Multi-Verification, the
   Voiceprint-Identifier header contains a list of semi-colon separated
   voiceprint identifiers.

   The header "Adapt-Model" may also be present in the START-SESSION
   request to indicate whether or not to adapt a voiceprint based on
   data collected during the session (if the voiceprint verification
   phase succeeds).  By default, the voiceprint model MUST NOT be
   adapted with data from a verification session.

   The START-SESSION also determines whether the session is for a train
   or verify of a voiceprint.  Hence the Verification-Mode header MUST
   be sent in every START-SESSION request.  The value of the
   Verification-Mode header MUST be one of either "train" or "verify".

   Before a verification/identification session is started, only VERIFY-
   ROLLBACK and generic "SET-PARAMS" and "GET-PARAMS" operations may be
   performed on the verification resource.  The server MUST return 402
   "Method not valid in this state" for all other verification
   operations.

   A verification resource may only have a single session active at one
   time.

11.7.  END-SESSION

   The END-SESSION method terminates an ongoing verification session and
   releases the verification voiceprint resources.  The session may
   terminate in one of three ways:
   a.  abort - the voiceprint adaptation or creation may be aborted so
       that the voiceprint remains unchanged (or is not created).
   b.  commit - when terminating a voiceprint training session, the new
       voiceprint is committed to the repository.
   c.  adapt - an existing voiceprint is modified using a successful
       verification.

   The header "Abort-Model" MAY be included in the END-SESSION to
   control whether or not to abort any pending changes to the

   voiceprint.  The default behavior is to commit (not abort) any
   pending changes to the designated voiceprint.

   The END-SESSION method may be safely executed multiple times without
   first executing the START-SESSION method.  Any additional executions
   of this method without an intervening use of the START-SESSION method
   have no effect on the verification resource.

   The following example assumes there is either a training session or a
   verification session in progress.

          Channel-Identifier:32AECB23433801@speakverify

11.8.  QUERY-VOICEPRINT

   The QUERY-VOICEPRINT method is used to get status information on a
   particular voiceprint and can be used by the client to ascertain if a
   voiceprint or repository exists and if it contains trained
   voiceprints.

   The response to the QUERY-VOICEPRINT request contains an indication
   of the status of the designated voiceprint in the "Voiceprint-Exists"
   header, allowing the client to determine whether to use the current
   voiceprint for verification, train a new voiceprint, or choose a
   different voiceprint.

   A voiceprint is completely specified by providing a repository
   location and a voiceprint identifier.  The particular voiceprint or
   identity within the repository is specified by a string identifier
   that is unique within the repository.  The "Voiceprint-Identifier"
   header carries this unique voiceprint identifier within a given
   repository.

   The following example assumes a verification session is in progress
   and the voiceprint exists in the voiceprint repository.

11.9.  DELETE-VOICEPRINT

   The DELETE-VOICEPRINT method removes a voiceprint from a repository.
   This method MUST carry the Repository-URI and Voiceprint-Identifier
   header fields.

   If the corresponding voiceprint does not exist, the DELETE-VOICEPRINT
   method MUST return a 200 status code.

   remove a specific voiceprint.

11.10.  VERIFY

   The VERIFY method is used to request the verification resource to
   either train/adapt the voiceprint or to verify/identify a claimed
   identity.  If the voiceprint is new or was deleted by a previous
   DELETE-VOICEPRINT method, the VERIFY method trains the voiceprint.
   If the voiceprint already exits, it is adapted and not retrained by
   the VERIFY command.

   S->C:  MRCP/2.0 49 543260 200 IN-PROGRESS
          Channel-Identifier:32AECB23433801@speakverify

   When the VERIFY request is completes, the MRCPv2 server MUST send a
   'VERIFICATION-COMPLETE' event to the client.

11.11.  VERIFY-FROM-BUFFER

   The VERIFY-FROM-BUFFER method directs the verification resource to
   verify buffered audio against a voiceprint.  Only one VERIFY or
   VERIFY-FROM-BUFFER method may be active for a verification resource
   at a time.

   The buffered audio is not consumed by this method and thus VERIFY-
   FROM-BUFFER may be invoked multiple times by the client to attempt
   verification against different voiceprints.

   For the VERIFY-FROM-BUFFER method, the server MAY optionally return
   an "IN-PROGRESS" response before the "VERIFICATION-COMPLETE" event.

   When the VERIFY-FROM-BUFFER method is invoked and the verification
   buffer is in use by another resource sharing it, the server MUST
   return an IN-PROGRESS response and wait until the buffer is available
   to it.  The verification buffer is owned by the verification resource
   but is shared with write access from other input resources on the
   same session.  Hence, it is considered to be in use if there is a
   read or write operation such as a RECORD or RECOGNIZE with the Ver-
   Buffer-Utterance header set to "true" on a resource that shares this
   buffer.  Note that if a RECORD or RECOGNIZE method returns with a
   failure cause code, the VERIFY-FROM-BUFFER request waiting to process
   that buffer MUST also fail with a Completion-Cause of 005 (buffer-
   empty).

   The following example illustrates the usage of some buffering
   methods.  In this scenario the client first performed a live
   verification, but the utterance had been rejected.  In the meantime,

   the utterance is also saved to the audio buffer.  Then, another
   voiceprint is used to do verification against the audio buffer and
   the utterance is accepted.  For the example, we assume both Num-Min-
   Verification-Phrases and Num-Max-Verification-Phrases are 1.

                        VERIFY-FROM-BUFFER example

11.12.  VERIFY-ROLLBACK

   The VERIFY-ROLLBACK method discards the last buffered utterance or
   discards the last live utterances (when the mode is "train" or
   "verify").  The client should invoke this method when the user
   provides undesirable input such as non-speech noises, side-speech,
   out-of-grammar utterances, commands, etc.  Note that this method does
   not provide a stack of rollback states.  Executing VERIFY-ROLLBACK
   twice in succession without an intervening recognition operation has
   no effect on the second attempt.

11.13.  STOP

   The "STOP" method from the client to the server tells the
   verification resource to stop the VERIFY or VERIFY-FROM-BUFFER
   request if one is active.  If such a request is active and the "STOP"
   request successfully terminated it, then the response header contains
   an active-request-id-list header containing the request-id of the
   VERIFY or VERIFY-FROM-BUFFER request that was terminated.  In this
   case, no VERIFICATION-COMPLETE event is sent for the terminated

   request.  If there was no verify request active, then the response
   MUST NOT contain an active-request-id-list header.  Either way the
   response MUST contain a status of 200 (Success).

   The "STOP" method can carry a "Abort-Verification" header which
   specifies if the verification result until that point should be
   discarded or returned.  If this header is not present or if the value
   is "true", the verification result is discarded and the "STOP"
   response does not contain any result data.  If the header is present
   and its value is "false", the "STOP" response MUST contain a
   "Completion-Cause" header and carry the Verification result data in
   its body.

   An aborted VERIFY request does an automatic roll-back and hence does
   not affect the cumulative score.  A VERIFY request that was stopped
   with no "Abort-Verification" header or with the "Abort-Verification"
   header set to "false" does affect cumulative scores and would need to
   be explicitly rolled-back if the client does not want the
   verification result considered in the cumulative scores.

   The following example assumes a voiceprint identity has already been
   established.

11.14.  START-INPUT-TIMERS

   This request is sent from the client to the verification resource to
   start the no-input timer, usually once the client has ascertained
   that any audio prompts to the user have played to completion.

   The VERIFICATION-COMPLETE event follows a call to VERIFY or VERIFY-
   FROM-BUFFER and is used to communicate the verification results to
   the client.  The event message body contains only verification
   results.

11.16.  START-OF-INPUT

   The START-OF-INPUT event is returned from the server to the client
   once the server has detected speech.  This event is always returned
   by the verification resource when speech has been detected,
   irrespective of whether the recognizer and verification resources
   share the same session or not.

11.17.  CLEAR-BUFFER

   The CLEAR-BUFFER method can be used to clear the verification buffer.
   This buffer is used to buffer speech during a recognition, record or
   verification operations that may later be used VERIFY-FROM-BUFFER.
   As noted before, the buffer associated with the verification resource
   is shared by other input resources like recognizers and recorders.
   Hence, a CLEAR-BUFFER request fails if the verification buffer is in
   use.  This can happen when any one of the input resources that shares
   this buffer has an active read or write operation such as RECORD,
   RECOGNIZE or VERIFY with the Ver-Buffer-Utterance header set to
   "true".

11.18.  GET-INTERMEDIATE-RESULT

   A client can use the GET-INTERMEDIATE-RESULT method to poll for
   intermediate results of a verification request that is in progress.
   Invoking this method does not change the state of the resource.  The
   verification resource collects the accumulated verification results
   and returns the information in the method response.  The message body
   in the response to a GET-INTERMEDIATE-RESULT REQUEST contains only
   verification results.  The method response MUST NOT contain a
   Completion-Cause header as the request is not yet complete.  If the
   resource does not have a verification in progress the response has a
   402 failure code and no result in the body.

12.  Security Considerations

   MRCPv2 is designed to comply with the security-related requirements
   documented in SpeechSC Requirements [RFC4313].  Implementers and
   users of MRCPv2 are strongly encouraged to read the Security
   Considerations section of [RFC4313], because that document contains
   discussion of a number of important security issues associated with
   the utilization of speech as biometric authentication technology, and
   on the threats against systems which store recorded speech, contain
   large corpora of voiceprints, and send and receive sensitive
   information based on voice input to a recognizer or speech output
   from a synthesizer.  Specific security measures employed by MRCPv2
   are summarized in the following subsections.  See the corresponding
   sections of this specification for how the security-related machinery
   is invoked by individual protocol operations.

12.1.  Rendezvous and Session Establishment

   MRCPv2 control sessions are established as media sessions described
   by SDP within the context of a SIP dialog.  In order to ensure secure
   rendezvous between MRCPv2 clients and servers, the following are
   required:

   1.  The SIP implementation in MRCPv2 clients and servers MUST support
       digest authentication.
   2.  The SIP implementation in MRCPv2 clients and servers SHOULD
       employ SIPS: URIs,
   3.  If media stream cryptographic keying is done through SDP (e.g.
       using [RFC4568]), the MRCPv2 clients and servers MUST employ
       SIPS:.

12.2.  Control channel protection

   Sensitive data is carried over the MRCPv2 control channel.  This
   includes things like the output of speech recognition operations,
   speaker verification results, input to text-to-speech conversion,
   etc.  For this reason MRCPv2 servers must be properly authenticated
   and the control channel must permit the use of both confidentiality
   and integrity for the data.  To ensure control channel protection,
   MRCPv2 clients and servers MUST support TLS and SHOULD utilize it by
   default unless alternative control channel protection is used.
   Alternative control channel protection MAY be used if desired (e.g.
   IPSEC).

12.3.  Media session protection

   Sensitive data is also carried on media sessions terminating on
   MRCPv2 servers (the other end of a media channel may or may not be on
   the MRCPv2 client).  This data includes the user's spoken utterances
   and the output of text-to-speech operations.  MRCPv2 servers MUST
   support a security mechanism for protection of audio media sessions.
   MRCPv2 clients that originate or consume audio similarly MUST support
   a security mechanism for protection of the audio.  If appropriate,
   usage of the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711] is
   recommended.

12.4.  Indirect Content Access

   MCRPv2 employs content indirection extensively.  Content may be
   fetched and/or stored based on URI-addressing on systems other than
   the MRCPv2 client or server.  Not all of the stored content is
   necessarily sensitive (e.g. grammar definitions, XML schemas), but
   the majority generally needs protection, and some indirect content,
   such as voice recordings and voiceprints, are extremely sensitive and



Shanmugham & Burnett    Expires February 12, 2010             [Page 165]

Internet-Draft                   MRCPv2                      August 2009


   must always be protected.  MRCPv2 clients and servers MUST implement
   HTTPS for indirect content access, and SHOULD employ secure access
   for all sensitive indirect content.  Other secure URI-schemes, such
   as FTPS or SIPS MAY also be used.  See Section 6.2.15 for the headers
   used to transfer cookie information between the MRCPv2 client and
   server if needed for authentication.

12.5.  Protection of stored media

   MRCPv2 applications often require the use of stored media.  Voice
   recordings are both stored (e.g. for diagnosis and system tuning),
   and fetched (for replaying utterances into multiple MRCPv2
   resources).  Voiceprints are fundamental to the speaker
   identification and verification functions.  This data can be
   extremely sensitive and can present substantial privacy and
   impersonation risks if stolen.  Systems employing MRCPv2 should be
   deployed in ways that minimize these risks.  The SpeechSC
   Requirements [RFC4313] contains a more extensive discussion of these
   risks and ways they may be mitigated.


13.  IANA Considerations

13.1.  New registries

   This section describes the name spaces (registries) for MRCPv2 that
   IANA is requested to create and maintain.  Assignment/registration
   policies are described in RFC5226 [RFC5226].

   IANA SHALL create a new name space of "MRCPv2 resource types".  All
   maintenance within and additions to the contents of this name space
   MUST be according to the "Standards Action" registration policy.  The
   initial contents of the registry, defined in Section 4.2, are given
   below:

   and additions to the contents of this name space MUST be according to
   the "Specification Required with Expert Review" registration policy.

   parameter, "weight", which is defined in Section 13.5.1 and
   Section 9.9.

   parameters".  All maintenance within and additions to the contents of

   registration policy as follows.  Each name (corresponding to the
   "vendor-av-pair-name" ABNF production) MUST satisfy the syntax
   requirements of Internet Domain Names as described in section 2.3.1
   of RFC1035 [RFC1035] (and as updated or obsoleted by successive
   RFCs), with one exception, the order of the domain names is reversed.
   For example, a vendor-specific parameter "foo" by example.com would
   have the form "com.example.foo".  The first, or top-level domain, is
   restricted to exactly the set of Top-Level Internet Domains defined
   by IANA and will be updated by IANA when and only when that set
   changes.  The second-level and all subdomains within the parameter
   name MUST be allocated according to the "Expert Review" policy.  The
   Designated Expert MAY advise IANA to allow delegation of subdomains
   to the requester.  As a general guideline, the Designated Expert is
   encouraged to manage the allocation of corporate, organizational, or
   institutional names and delegate all subdomains accordingly.  For
   example, the Designated Expert MAY allocate "com.example" and
   delegate all subdomains of that name to the organization represented
   by the Internet domain name "example.com".  For simplicity, the
   Designated Expert is encouraged to perform allocations according to
   the existing allocations of Internet domain names to organizations,
   institutions, corporations, etc.

   The registry contains a list of vendor-registered parameters, where
   each defined parameter is associated with a reference to an RFC
   defining it.  The registry is initially empty.

13.2.  NLSML-related registrations

13.2.1.  application/nlsml+xml Media Type registration

   IANA is requested to register the following Media Type according to
   the process defined in RFC4288 [RFC4288].
   To:  ietf-types@iana.org
   Subject:  Registration of media type application/nlsml+xml
   MIME media type name:  application
   MIME subtype name:  nlsml+xml
   Required parameters:  none
   Optional parameters:
      charset:  All of the considerations described in RFC3023 also
         apply to the application/nlsml+xml media type.
   Encoding considerations:  All of the considerations described in
      RFC3023 also apply to the application/nlsml+xml media type.
   Security considerations:  As with HTML, NLSML documents contain links
      to other data stores (grammars, verification resources, etc.).
      Unlike HTML, however, the data stores are not treated as media to
      be rendered.  Nevertheless, linked files may themselves have
      security considerations, which would be those of the individual
      registered types.  Additionally, this media type has all of the

Internet-Draft                   MRCPv2                      August 2009


      security considerations described in RFC3023.
   Interoperability considerations:  Although an NLSML document is
      itself a complete XML document, for a fuller interpretation of the
      content a receiver of an NLSML document may wish to access
      resources linked to by the document.  The inability of an NLSML
      processor to access or process such linked resources could result
      in different behavior by the ultimate consumer of the data.
   Published specification:  RFCXXXX
   Applications which use this media type:  MRCPv2 clients and servers
   Additional information:  none
   Magic number(s):  There is no single initial byte sequence that is
      always present for NLSML files.
   Person & email address to contact for further information:  Sarvi
      Shanmugham, sarvi@cisco.com
   Intended usage:  This media type is expected to be used only in
      conjunction with MRCPv2.

13.3.  NLSML XML Schema registration

   IANA is requested to register and maintain the following XML Schema.
   Information provided follows the template in RFC3688 [RFC3688].
   XML element type:  schema
   URI:  http://www.ietf.org/xml/schema/mrcpv2
   Registrant Contact:  IESG
   XML:  See Section 16.1.

13.4.  MRCPv2 XML Namespace registration

   IANA is requested to register and maintain the following XML Name
   space.  Information provided follows the template in RFC3688
   [RFC3688].
   XML element type:  ns
   URI:  http://www.ietf.org/xml/ns/mrcpv2
   Registrant Contact:  IESG
   XML:  RFCXXXX

13.5.  text Media Type Registrations

   IANA is requested to register the following text Media Types
   according to the process defined in RFC 4288 [RFC4288].

13.5.1.  text/grammar-ref-list

Internet-Draft                   MRCPv2                      August 2009


   Subject:  Registration of media type text/grammar-ref-list
   MIME media type name:  application
   MIME subtype name:  text/grammar-ref-list
   Required parameters:  none
   Optional parameters:  none
   Encoding considerations:  Depending on the transfer protocol, a
      transfer encoding may be necessary to deal with very long lines.
   Security considerations:  This media type contains URIs which may
      represent references to external resources.  As these resources
      are assumed to be speech recognition grammars, similar
      considerations as for the media types "application/srgs" and
      "application/srgs+xml" apply.
   Interoperability considerations;  '>' must be percent encoded in URIs
      according to RFC3986.
   Published specification:  The RECOGNIZE method of the MRCP protocol
      performs a recognition operation that matches input against a set
      of grammars.  When matching against more than one grammar, it is
      sometimes necessary to use different weights for the individual
      grammars.  These weights are not a property of the grammar
      resource itself but qualify the reference to that grammar for the
      particular recognition operation initiated by the RECOGNIZE
      method.  The format of the proposed text/grammar-ref-list media
      type is as follows: body = *reference where reference = "<" uri
      ">" [parameters] CRLF parameters = ";" parameter *(";" parameter)
      and parameter = attribute "=" value.  This specification currently
      only defines a 'weight' parameter, but new parameters may be added
      through the "Grammar Reference List Parameters" IANA registry
      established through this specification.  Example:
      <http://example.com/grammars/field1.gram>
      <http://example.com/grammars/field2.gram>;weight="0.85"
      <session:field3@form-level.store>;weight="0.9"
      <http://example.com/grammars/universals.gram>;weight="0.75"
   Applications which use this media type:  MRCPv2 clients and servers
   Additional information:  none
   Magic number(s):  none
   Person & email address to contact for further information:  Sarvi
      Shanmugham, sarvi@cisco.com
   Intended usage:  This media type is expected to be used only in
      conjunction with MRCPv2.

13.6.  session URL scheme registration

   IANA is requested to register the following new URI scheme.  The
   information below follows the template given in RFC4395 [RFC4395].

   URL scheme name:  "session"
   URL scheme syntax:  The syntax of this scheme is identical to that
      defined for the "cid" scheme in section 2 of RFC2392.
   Character encoding considerations:  URI values are limited to the US-
      ASCII character set.
   Intended usage:  The URI is intended to identify a data resource
      previously given to the network computing resource.  The purpose
      of this scheme is to permit access to the specific resource for
      the lifetime of the session with the entity storing the resource.
      The media type of the resource CAN vary.  There is no explicit
      mechanism for communication of the media type.  This scheme is
      currently widely used internally by existing implementations, and
      the registration is intended to provide information in the rare
      (and unfortunate) case that the scheme is used elsewhere.  The
      scheme SHOULD NOT be used for open internet protocols.
   Applications and/or protocols which use this URL scheme name:  This
      scheme name is used by MRCPv2 clients and servers.
   Interoperability considerations:
      The character set for URLs is restricted to US-ASCII.  Note that
      none of the resources are accessible after the MCRPv2 session
      ends, hence the name of the scheme.  For clients who establish one
      MRCPv2 session only for the entire speech application being
      implemented this is sufficient, but clients who create, terminate,
      and recreate MRCP sessions for performance or scalability reasons
      will lose access to resources established in the earlier
      session(s).
   Security considerations:  The URIs defined here provide an
      identification mechanism only.  Given that the communication
      channel between client and server is secure, that the server
      correctly accesses the resource associated with the URI, and that
      the server ensures session-only lifetime and access for each URI,
      the only remaining security issues are those of the types of media
      referred to by the URI.

14.  Examples

14.1.  Message Flow

   The following is an example of a typical MRCPv2 session of speech
   synthesis and recognition between a client and a server.

   The figure below illustrates opening a session to the MRCPv2 server.
   This is exchange does not allocate a resource or setup media.  It
   simply establishes a SIP session with the MRCPv2 server.

   The client requests the server to create synthesizer resource control
   channel to do speech synthesis.  This also adds a media pipe to send
   the generated speech.  Note that in this example, the client requests
   a new MRCPv2 TCP pipe between the client and the server.  In the

   This exchange allocates an additional resource control channel for a

   for recognition, this interaction also updates the audio stream to

   and asking for input, that the client issue the RECOGNIZE request
   ahead of the "SPEAK" request for optimum performance and user
   experience.  This way, it is guaranteed that the recognizer is online
   before the prompt starts playing and the user's speech will not be
   truncated at the beginning (especially for power users).

   Since the last "SPEAK" request had Kill-On-Barge-In set to "true",
   the speech synthesizer is interrupted when the user starts speaking.
   And the client is notified.

   Now, since the recognition and synthesizer resources are on the same
   session, they may have worked with each other to deliver kill-on-
   barge-in.  Whether the synthesizer and recognizer are in the same
   session or not the recognizer MUST generate the START-OF-INPUT event
   to the client.

   The client MUST then blindly turn around and issued a BARGE-IN-
   OCCURRED method to the synthesizer resource (if a "SPEAK" request was
   active).  The synthesizer, if kill-on-barge-in was enabled on the
   current "SPEAK" request, would have then interrupted it and issued a
   "SPEAK"-COMPLETE event to the client.

   The completion-cause code differentiates if this is normal completion
   or a kill-on-barge-in interruption.

14.2.2.  Mixed Initiative

   System: What would you like?
   User:   I would like 2 pizzas, one with pepperoni and cheese,
           one with sausage and a bottle of coke, to go.

   This example includes an order object which in turn contains objects
   named "food_item", "drink_item" and "delivery_method".  The
   representation assumes there are no ambiguities in the speech or
   natural language processing.  Note that this representation also
   assumes some level of intra-sentential anaphora resolution, i.e., to
   resolve the two "one's" as "pizza".

14.2.3.  DTMF Input

   A combination of DTMF input and speech is represented using nested
   input elements.  For example:
   User: My pin is (dtmf 1 2 3 4)

   <input>
     <input mode="speech" confidence ="1.0"
        timestamp-start="2000-04-03T0:00:00"
        timestamp-end="2000-04-03T0:00:01.5">My pin is
     </input>
     <input mode="dtmf" confidence ="1.0"
        timestamp-start="2000-04-03T0:00:01.5"
        timestamp-end="2000-04-03T0:00:02.0">1 2 3 4
     </input>
   </input>

   Note that grammars that recognize mixtures of speech and DTMF are not
   currently possible in VoiceXML; however this representation may be
   needed for other applications of NLSML, and it may be introduced in
   future versions of VoiceXML.

14.2.4.  Interpreting Meta-Dialog and Meta-Task Utterances

   Natural language communication makes use of meta-dialog and meta-task
   utterances.  This specification is flexible enough so that meta
   utterances can be represented on an application-specific basis
   without requiring other standard markup.

   Here are two examples of how meta-task and meta-dialog utterances
   might be represented.

System: What toppings do you want on your pizza?

       <doer>system</doer>
    </command>
   </instance>
  <input mode="speech">slow down</input>
</interpretation>

14.2.5.  Anaphora and Deixis

   This specification can be used on an application-specific basis to
   represent utterances that contain unresolved anaphoric and deictic
   references.  Anaphoric references, which include pronouns and
   definite noun phrases that refer to something that was mentioned in
   the preceding linguistic context, and deictic references, which refer
   to something that is present in the non-linguistic context, present
   similar problems in that there may not be sufficient unambiguous
   linguistic context to determine what their exact role in the
   interpretation should be.  In order to represent unresolved anaphora
   and deixis using this specification, one strategy would be for the
   developer to define a more surface-oriented representation that
   leaves the specific details of the interpretation of the reference
   open.  (This assumes that a later component is responsible for
   actually resolving the reference).

             pointing gesture.)

         <nl:input mode="speech">I want this</nl:input>
      </nl:interpretation>
   </nl:result>

14.2.6.  Distinguishing Individual Items from Sets with One Member

   For programming convenience, it is useful to be able to distinguish
   between individual items and sets containing one item in the XML
   representation of semantic results.  For example, a pizza order might
   consist of exactly one pizza, but a pizza might contain zero or more
   toppings.  Since there is no standard way of marking this distinction
   directly in XML, in the current framework, the developer is free to
   adopt any conventions that would convey this information in the XML
   markup.  One strategy would be for the developer to wrap the set of
   items in a grouping element, as in the following example.

   <order>
      <pizza>
         <topping-group>
            <topping>mushrooms</topping>
         </topping-group>
      </pizza>
      <drink>coke</drink>
   </order>

   In this example, the programmer can assume that there is supposed to
   be exactly one pizza and one drink in the order, but the fact that
   there is only one topping is an accident of this particular pizza
   order.

   Note that the client controls both the grammar and the semantics to
   be returned upon grammar matches, so the user of the MRCP protocol is

   fully empowered to cause results to be returned in NLSML in such a
   way that the interpretation is clear to that user.

14.2.7.  Extensibility

   Extensibility in NLSML is provided via result content flexibility, as
   discussed in the discussions of meta utterances and anaphora.  NLSML
   can easily be used in sophisticated systems to convey application-
   specific information that more basic systems would not make use of,
   for example defining speech acts.
