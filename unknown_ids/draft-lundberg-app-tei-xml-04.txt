Internet-Draft     The 'application/tei+xml' mediatype      October 2010


1.  Introduction

   Text Encoding and Interchange (TEI) is an international and
   interdisciplinary standard that is widely used by libraries, museums,
   publishers, and individual scholars to represent all kinds of textual
   material for online research and teaching.[TEI]

   This document defines the 'application/tei+xml' media type in
   accordance with [RFC3023] in order enable generic XML processing of
   TEI documents on the Internet.

2.  Recognizing TEI files

   TEI files are XML documents or fragments having the root element in a
   TEI namespace.  TEI namespace URIs start with
   http://www.tei-c.org/ns/ followed by the version number of the
   namespace.  The current namespace is http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0

   In general, a [TEI] file usually contains either of the strings

      <TEI

      <teiCorpus

   near the beginning, and usually after an XML declaration on the first
   line, i.e., a string like "<?xml ... ?>".

   The teiCorpus documents give the possibility to bundle multiple
   documents into a single file.

   Examples:

      A document beginning with <TEI

               <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
               <TEI xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">
               <teiHeader>
               ...
               </teiHeader>
               <text>
               ...
               </text>
               </TEI>

      A document beginning with <teiCorpus

3.  Fragment identifier

   Documents having the media type 'application/tei+xml', use the
   fragment identifier notation as specified in [RFC3023] for the media
   type 'application/xml'.

4.  Security considerations

   An XML resource does not in itself compromise data security.  When
   being available on a network simply through the dereferencing of an
   IRI [RFC3987] or a URI, care must be taken to properly interpret the
   data to prevent unintended access.  Hence the security issues of
   [RFC3986], section 7, apply.  In addition, as this media type uses
   the "+xml" convention, it shares the same security considerations as
   described in RFC 3023 [RFC3023], section 10.

4.1.  Harmful content

   Any application accepting submitted or retrieving TEI XML for
   processing has to be aware of risks connected with injection of
   harmful scripts and executable XML.  Even common XML inclusion or the
   use of external entities, could potentially be used to reveal aspects
   of a service that may compromise its security.  Any vulnerability of
   these kinds are, however, application specific.  The TEI namespaces
   do not contain such elements.

4.2.  Intellectual Property Rights

   TEI documents often arise in digitization of cultural heritage
   materials.  Texts made accessible in TEI format may be unrestricted
   in the sense that there are no restrictions to their distribution
   through Digital Rights Management[DRM] or Intellectual Property
   Rights[IPR] constraints.  TEI documents are heterogeneous objects.
   Some parts of a document may be unrestricted, whereas other parts,
   such as editorial text and annotations may be written much later may
   hence be subject to DRM restrictions.

   The TEI format provides means for highly granular attribution, down
   to the content of individual XML elements.  Software agents
   participating in the exchange or processing TEI must honour markup of
   this kind.  Even when there are no IPR constraints, intellectual
   property attribution alone requires that document users are able to
   tell the difference between content from different sources.

4.3.  Authenticity and confidentiality

   Historical archival records are often encoded in TEI and legal
   document may be binding centuries after they were written.
   Digitization and encoding of legal texts may require technologies for
   assuring authenticity, such as cryptographic check sums and
   electronic signatures.

   Similarly, historical documents may in part or in their entirety be
   confidential.  This may be required by law or by the terms and

   conditions such as in the case of donated or deposited text from
   private sources.  A text archive may need content filtering or
   cryptographic technologies to meet such requirements.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Registration of MIME type 'application/tei+xml'

      MIME media type name: application

      MIME subtype name: tei+xml

      Required parameters: None

      Optional parameters: charset

         the parameter has identical semantics to the charset parameter
         of the "application/xml" media type as specified in RFC 3023
         [RFC3023].

      Encoding considerations:

         Identical to those for 'application/xml'.  See RFC 3023
         [RFC3023], Section 3.2.

      Security considerations:

         See Security considerations (Section 4) in this specification.

      Interoperability considerations:

         TEI documents often have the extension '.xml', which is not
         uncommon for other XML document formats.

      Published specification:

         This media type registration is for TEI documents[TEI] as
         described in this document.

      Applications which use this media type:

         There are currently no known applications using the media type
         'application/tei+xml'.

      Additional information:

         Magic number(s):

            There is no single initial octet sequence that is always
            present in TEI documents.

         file extension(s):

            Common extensions are '.tei', '.teiCorpus' and '.odd'.

         Macintosh File Type Code(s)

            TEXT

         Object Identifier(s) or OID(s)
