The Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA) Application Configurations
            Access Protocol (ACAP) Vendor Subtrees Registry
                 draft-cridland-acap-vendor-registry-01

Abstract

   The original ACAP specification included a vendor registry now used
   in other protocols.  This document updates the description of this
   registry, removing the need for a direct normative reference to ACAP,
   and removing ambiguity.

Internet-Draft        ACAP Vendor Subtrees Registry             Aug 2010


1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

   Formal Syntax are to be considered normative, and are specified using
   [ABNF].  Where a formal syntax and the prose are in conflict, the
   formal syntax takes precedence.


2.  Introduction

   The [ACAP] specification includes the specification and creation of
   the ACAP Vendor Registry, and this registry has subsequently been
   reused by several specifications, including both [ANNOTATE] and
   [METADATA], and is proving to be a useful mechanism for namespacing
   various names to within a specific vendor's scope.

   This document merely updates the registry to reduce ambiguity in the
   original specification, and dissociates it from the original document
   in all but name, allowing easier referencing.  It replaces section
   7.4 and portions of section 4, particularly 4.3, of [ACAP].


3.  The Vendor Subtree Registry

   A Vendor Token is a UTF-8 string beginning with "vendor.", and
   followed by the name of the company or product.  This name MUST NOT
   contain any slash character, period, or the percent and asterisk
   characters typically used as wildcards.

   Following this may be names, separated from the Vendor Token by a
   period, which need not be registered, thus forming a complete Vendor
   Name.

3.1.  Internationalization

   Vendor Tokens are able to contain any valid Unicode codepoint,
   encoded as [UTF-8], except the special characters.  Since the
   publication of [ACAP], however, concerns have been raised on the
   handling and comparison of full Unicode strings, and therefore this
   specification restricts the current registrations to the ASCII subset
   of UTF-8.

   Furthermore, characters such as control characters, whitespace, and
   quotes are likely to be confusing and have been similarly restricted.

   Therefore, this document allows only ASCII letters, digits, the
   hyphen, and space to be used.

3.2.  Formal Syntax

   This syntax draws upon productions found within [ABNF] and [UTF-8].
   Productions replace those in section 4.3 of [ACAP].

   vendor-name         = vendor-token ["." name-component]

   name-component      = *(name-char / UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4)

   name-char           = %x01-24 / %x26-29 / %x2B-2D / %x30-7F
                     ;; ASCII-range characters not including ".",
                     ;; "/", "%", or "*".

   vendor-token        = "vendor." vendor-tag

   vendor-tag          = iana-vendor-tag / possible-vendor-tag

   iana-vendor-tag     = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / SP / "-")
                     ;; This production represents
                     ;; allowed forms for current registrations.

   possible-vendor-tag = name-component
                     ;; This production represents what
                     ;; applications and specifications
                     ;; may encounter.

3.3.  Examples

   A company Example Ltd might register the Subtree "vendor.example".
   This means it may use "vendor.example", or any name at all beginning
   "vendor.example.", such as "vendor.example.product".

   These names might be used in several protocols, and are reserved in
   all the relevant protocols, so "vendor.example" might be an ACAP
   dataset class name, and "/vendor/vendor.example" might be a tree of
   IMAP ANNOTATE entries.

   Example Ltd is free to use either "vendor.example", and group
   specific products under it using the relevant protocol's hierarchy -
   perhaps "/shared/vendor/vendor.example/product", or using more
   specific names, such as "/shared/vendor/vendor.example.product".

3.4.  Changes from RFC 2244

   This non-normative section details changes from RFC 2244's original
   specification of the registry.
   o  UTF-8 names are restricted to ASCII
   o  Clarifications that "vendor.<company/product name>" means
      "vendor.company name" or "vendor.product name" - "vendor.company/
      product" is and always has been illegal.
   o  Made "vendor.company" a name in its own right - RFC 2244 only
      refers to a prefix of "vendor.company.".
   o  Added example registration, in line with [EXAMPLES].


4.  IANA Considerations

   This specification updates the IANA registry named the ACAP Vendor
   Subtrees Registry.

   Vendors may reserve a portion of the ACAP namespace, which is also
   used as the namespace for several other protocols, for private use.
   Vendor Names are reserved for use by that company or product,
   wherever used, once registered.  Registration is on a first come,
   first served basis.  Whenever possible, private attributes and
   classes should be eschewed in favour of improving interoperable
   protocols.

   Vendors may only use names conforming to iana-vendor-tag at the
   current time, future revisions of this specification may change this.

4.1.  Example Registration

   IANA is requested to add the following registration, for use by
   specification authors in examples, similarly to the domains specified
   in [EXAMPLES]:

5.  Security Considerations

   There are no known security issues with this registry.  Individual
   protocols using vendor subtree names may have security issues, and
   the introduction of Unicode has in itself security implications - the
   restriction of this is thought to mitigate these.


6.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks must go to Chris Newman, John Myers, and the other designers
   of ACAP for the initial creation of the registry.  Thanks also to
   Alexey Melnikov for advice on this revision.
