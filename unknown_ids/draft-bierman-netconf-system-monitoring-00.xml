	The NETCONF protocol provides mechanisms to manipulate configuration
        datastores.  However, client applications often need to examine
        system information to determine the appropriate configuration
        requirements.   In addition, common system events such as a
        change in system capabilities may impact management applications.
        Standard mechanisms are needed to support the monitoring of
        the managed system supported by a NETCONF server.
	This document defines a YANG module for the monitoring of
	system information, which allows a NETCONF client to

	This document defines a YANG module for reporting of
        particular system information and system events.
        Although unlikely, it is possible that data obtained from this module could
        be used in an attack of some kind, although no specific
        information in this module is considered sensitive.
