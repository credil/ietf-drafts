Internet-Draft           CCMP Call Flow Examples            October 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document provides detailed call flows for the scenarios
   documented in the Framework for Centralized Conferencing (XCON
   Framework) [RFC5239] and the XCON Scenarios [RFC4597].  The XCON
   scenarios describe a broad range of use cases taking advantage of the
   advanced conferencing capabilities provided by a system realization
   of the XCON framework.  The call flows document the use of the
   interface between a conference control client and a conference
   control server using the Centralized Conferencing Manipulation
   Protocol (CCMP)[I-D.ietf-xcon-ccmp].

   Due to the broad range of functionality provided by the XCON
   Framework and the flexibility of the CCMP messaging, these call flows
   should not be considered inclusive of all the functionality that can
   provided by the XCON Framework and protocol implementations.  These
   flows represent a sample to provide an overview of the feature rich
   capabilities of the XCON framework and CCMP messaging for protocol
   developers, software developers and researchers.


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the same terminology as found in the Media Control
   Architectural Framework [RFC5567] and Media Control Channel Framework
   Call Flow Examples [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-call-flows], with the
   following terms and abbreviations used in the call flows.  Also, note
   that the term "call flows" is used in a very generic sense in this
   document since the media is not limited to voice.  The calls
   supported by the XCON framework and CCMP can consist of media such as
   text, voice and video, including multiple media types in a single
   active conference.

   Conference and Media Control Client (CMCC):  as defined in the XCON
      Framework.  In the flows in this document, the CMCC is logically
      equivalent to the use of UAC as the client notation in the media
      control call flows [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-call-flows].  A CMCC
      differs from a generic Media Client in being an XCON-aware entity,
      thus being able to also issue CCMP requests.


   Conferencing Server (ConfS):  In this document, the term
      "Conferencing Server" is used interchangeably with the term
      "Application Server" (AS) as used in the Media Control
      Architectural Framework [RFC5567].  A Conferencing Server is
      intended to be able to act as a Conference Control Server, as
      defined in the XCON framework, i.e. it is able to handle CCMP
      requests and issue CCMP responses.

3.  Overview

   This document provides a sampling of detailed call flows that can be
   implemented based on a system realization of the XCON framework
   [RFC5239] and implementation of CCMP [I-D.ietf-xcon-ccmp].  This is
   intended to be a simple guide for the use of the Conference Control
   Protocol between the Conferencing Server and the Conference Control
   Client.  The objective is to provide an informational base reference
   for protocol developers, software developers and researchers.

   This document focuses on the interaction between the Conference (and
   Media) Control Client and the Conferencing System, specifically the
   Conferencing Server.  The scenarios are based on those described in
   the XCON framework, many of which are based on the advanced
   conferencing capabilities described in the XCON scenarios.
   Additional scenarios have been added to provide examples of other
   real life scenarios that are anticipated to be supported by the
   framework.  With the exception of an initial example with media
   control messaging, the examples do not include the details for the
   media control [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-mixer-control-package], call
   signaling or binary floor control [RFC4582] protocols.  This document
   references the scenarios in the Media Control call flows
   [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-call-flows], SIP Call Control Conferencing
   [RFC4579] and binary floor control protocol documents.

   The rest of this document is organized as follows.  Section 4
   presents an overview on CCMP, together with some implementation-
   related details and related matters like HTTP transport and
   notifications.  Section 5 presents the reader with examples showing
   the different approaches CCMP provides to create a new conference.
   Section 6 more generally addresses the different user-related
   manipulations that can be achieved by means of CCMP, by presenting a
   number of interesting scenarios.  Section 7 addresses the several
   scenarios that may involve the use of sidebars.  Section 8 shows how
   CCMP can be used to remove conferences and users from the system.
   Finally, Section 10 provides a few details for what concerns the
   Security Considerations when it comes to implementing CCMP.


4.  Working with CCMP

   This section provides a brief introduction as to how the Centralized
   Conferencing Manipulation Protocol (CCMP) [I-D.ietf-xcon-ccmp] works
   and how it can be transported across a network.  A typical CCMP

   interaction focusing on relevant aspects of the client-server
   communication is described.  Please note that this section assumes
   the reader has an understanding of and has read the CCMP document.
   This section is intended to help the reader understand the actual
   protocol interactions.

   First a description of the protocol itself is provided Section 4.1,
   including some implementation considerations.  In Section 4.2, an
   effective CCMP interaction is presented by exploiting HTTP as a
   transport.  Finally, notifications are described in Section 4.3.

   The document then presents and describes some actual flows in detail
   in the sections to follow.

4.1.  CCMP and the Data Model

   CCMP is an XML-based protocol.  It has been designed as a request/
   response protocol.  It is completely stateless, which means
   implementations can safely handle transactions independently from
   each other.

   The protocol allows for the manipulation of conference objects and
   related users.  This manipulation allows a Conferencing Client
   (briefly CMCC in all the following sections) to create, update and
   remove basically everything that is related to the objects handled by
   a conferencing system.  This is reflected in the allowed operations
   (retrieve, create, update, delete) and the specified request types
   (ranging from the manipulation of blueprints and conferences to users
   and sidebars).  For instance, CCMP provides ways to:

   o  retrieve the list of registered and/or active conferences in the
      system;

   o  create new conferences by exploiting to several different
      approaches;

   o  add/remove users to/from a conference;

   o  update a conference with respect to all of its aspects;

   and so on.

   While CCMP acts as the means to manipulate conference objects, CCMP
   does not define these conference objects.  A separate document
   specifies how a conference object and all its components have to be
   constructed: the Conference Information Data Model for Centralized
   Conferencing (XCON) [I-D.ietf-xcon-common-data-model].  CCMP,
   depending upon the request type and the related operation, carries

Internet-Draft           CCMP Call Flow Examples            October 2010


   pieces of conference objects (or any object as a whole) according to
   the aforementioned specification.  This means that any implementation
   aiming at being compliant with CCMP has to make sure that the
   transported objects are completely compliant with the Data Model
   specification and coherent with the constraints defined therein.  To
   make this clearer, there are elements that are mandatory in a
   conference object: issuing a syntactically correct CCMP request that
   carries a wrong conference object is doomed to result in a failure.
   For this reason, it is suggested that the interested implementors
   take special care in carefully checking the Data Model handlers as
   well in order to avoid potential mistakes.

   However, there are cases when a mandatory element in the Data Model
   cannot be assigned in a conference object by a CCMP user.  For
   example, a CMCC may be requesting the direct creation of a new
   conference: in this case, a conference object assumes an 'entity'
   element uniquely identifying the conference to be in place.  Thus,
   the CMCC has no way to know a priori what the entity will be, since
   it is generated by the ConfS after the request.  For scenarios like
   this one, the CCMP specification describes the use of a dedicated
   placeholder wildcard (i.e., AUTO_GENERATE_X, where X is an integer)
   to make the conference object compliant with the Data Model: the
   wildcard would then be replaced by the ConfS with the right value.

4.2.  Using HTTP as a transport

   CCMP requests and responses can be transported from a client to a
   server and viceversa in several ways, since the protocol
   specification is agnostic with respect to the transport.  However,
   [I-D.ietf-xcon-ccmp] requires that implementations support HTTP.  The
   following provides a brief explanation, from a more practical point
   of view, of how HTTP might be exploited to carry CCMP messages.  In
   this document, however, all the call flows presented just show the
   CCMP interactions, without describing how the messages are
   transported.

   When HTTP is used as a transport, a CMCC sends his request as part of
   an HTTP POST message, and the ConfS would reply with an HTTP 200
   message.  In both cases, the HTTP messages would have the CCMP
   messages as payload, which would be reflected in the Content-Type
   message (application/ccmp+xml).  Figure 1 presents a ladder diagram
   of such interaction, which is followed by a dump of the exchanged
   HTTP messages for further analysis:

                          Figure 1: CCMP on HTTP

   Per the protocol dump in the following lines, the CMCC has issued a
   CCMP request (a blueprintRequest with a 'retrieve' operation) towards
   the Conferencing Server (ConfS).  The request has been carried as
   payload of an HTTP POST (message 1.) towards a previously known
   location.  The mandatory 'Host' header has been specified, and the
   'Content-Type' header has been correctly set as well (application/
   ccmp+xml).

   The ConfS, in turn, has handled the request and replied accordingly.
   The response (a blueprintResponse with a successful response code)
   has been carried as payload of an HTTP 200 OK (message 2.).  As
   before, the 'Content-Type' header has been correctly set
   (application/ccmp+xml).

   For completeness, the following provides some details of the CCMP
   interaction.  Despite the simplicity of the request, this flow
   provides some relevant information on how CCMP messages are built.
   Specifically, both the request and the response share a subset of the
   message:

   o  confUserID: this element, provided by the CMCC, refers to the
      requester by means of his XCON-USERID; except in a few scenarios
      (presented in the following sections) this element must always
      contain a valid value;

   o  confObjID: this element refers to the target conference object,
      according to the request in place;

   o  operation: this element specifies the operation the CMCC wants to
      perform according to the specific request type.

   Besides those elements, the CMCC (let's say Alice, whose 'confUserID'
   is 'xcon-userid:Alice@example.com') has also provided an additional
   element, 'blueprintRequest'.  The name of that element varies
   according to the request type the CMCC is interested in.  In this
   specific scenario, the CMCC was interested in acquiring details
   concerning a specific blueprint (identified by its XCON-URI
   'xcon:AudioRoom@example.com', as reflected in the provided
   'confObjID' target element), and so the request consisted in an empty
   'blueprintRequest' element.  It will be clearer in the following
   sections that different request types may require different elements
   and, as a consequence, different content.

   Considering the request was a 'blueprintRequest', the ConfS has
   replied with a 'blueprintResponse' element.  This element includes a
   complete dump of the conference object (compliant with the Data
   Model) describing the requested blueprint.

   Without providing additional details of this interaction, it is worth
   noting that this was the example of the simplest CCMP communication
   that could take place between a CMCC and a ConfS, a blueprintRequest:
   this scenario will be described in more detail in Section 5.2.

4.3.  Conference Notifications

   The XCON framework [RFC5239] identifies several different possible
   protocol interactions between a conferencing server and a
   conferencing client.  One of those interactions is generically called
   "Notification Protocol" providing a mechanism for all clients
   interested in being informed by the server whenever something
   relevant happens in a conference.  When SIP is used as the call
   signaling protocol in a CCMP implementation, the XCON Event Package
   [I-D.ietf-xcon-event-package], which extends the SIP Event Package
   for Conference State [RFC4575] must be supported.  A SIP client uses
   the SIP SUBSCRIBE message for the XCON Event Package to subscribe to
   notifications related to a specific conference.  A SIP client would
   receive notifications describing all the changes to the document via
   SIP NOTIFY message.  An example ladder diagram is presented in
   Figure 2: in this figure, we assume a CMCC has updated a conference
   object, and a previously subscribed SIP client is notified of the
   update.

5.  Conference Creation

   This section provides details associated with the various ways in
   which a conference can be created using CCMP and the XCON framework
   constructs.  As previously mentioned, the details of the media
   control, call signaling and floor control protocols, where
   applicable, are annotated in the flows without showing all the
   details.  This also applies to CCMP, whose flows are related to the
   protocol alone, hiding any detail concerning the transport that may
   have been used (e.g.  HTTP).  However, for clarification purposes,
   the first example Section 5.1 provides the details of the media
   control messaging with the standard annotation used throughout the
   remainder of this document.  In subsequent flows, only this

   annotation (identified by lower case letters) is included and the
   reader is encouraged to refer to the call flows in the relevant
   documents for details about the other protocols.  The annotations for
   the call signaling are on the left side of the conferencing server
   vertical bar and those for the media control messaging are on the
   right side.

5.1.  Basic Conference Creation

   The simplest manner in which a conference can be created is
   accomplished by the client sending a "confRequest" message with the
   "create" operation as the only parameter to the conference server,
   together with the "confUserID" associated with the requesting client
   itself.  This results in the creation of a default conference, with
   an XCON-URI in the form of the "confObjID" parameter, the XCON-USERID
   in the form of the "confUserID" parameter (the same one already
   present in the request) and the data for the conference object in the
   "confInfo" parameter all returned in the "confResponse" message.
   This example also adds the issuing user to the conference upon
   creation with the "method" attribute in the <target> element of
   <allowed-users-list> set to "dial out".

   The specific data for the conference object is returned in the
   "confResponse" message in the "confInfo" parameter.  This allows the
   client (with the appropriate authorization) to manipulate these data
   and add additional participants to the conference, as well as change
   the data during the conference.  In addition, the client may
   distribute the conferencing information to other participants
   allowing them to join, the details of which are provided in
   additional flows.  Please notice that, according to the CCMP
   specification, the return of the new conference data in the
   "confInfo" parameter is not mandatory: if the "confInfo" parameter of
   the successful confResponse/create is not included in the response, a
   subsequent confRequest/retrieve of the returned "confObjID" can be
   triggered to provide the requesting client with the detailed
   conference description.

   Clients that are not XCON-aware can join the conference using a
   specific signaling interface such as SIP [RFC3261] (using the
   signaling interface to the conference focus as described in
   [RFC4579]), or other supported signaling protocols, being XCON
   agnostic with respect to them.  However, these details are not shown
   in the message flows.  The message flows in this document identify
   the point in the message flows at which this signaling occurs via the
   lower case letter items (i.e., (a)...(x)) along with the appropriate
   text for the processing done by the conferencing server.

   As previously described, this example also shows how the conferencing

Internet-Draft           CCMP Call Flow Examples            October 2010


   system may make use of other standard protocol components for
   complete functionality.  An example of that is the MEDIACTRL
   specification, which allows the conferencing system to configure
   conference mixes, IVR dialogs and all sort of media-related
   interactions an application like this may need.  In order to provide
   the reader with some insight on these interactions, the conferencing
   system in this example also configures and starts a mixer via
   MEDIACTRL as soon as the conference is created (transactions A1 and
   A2), and attaches clients to it when necessary (e.g. when CMCC1 joins
   the conference by means of SIP signaling, its media channels are
   attached to the Media Server using MEDIACTRL in B1/B2).  Note, that
   the MEDIACTRL interfaces are NOT shown in the remaining call flows in
   this document, but rather follow the same annotation as with the SIP
   signaling such that (b) correlates with the A1 and A2 transactions
   and (d) correlates with the B1 and B2 transactions.

5.2.  Conference Creation using Blueprints

   The previous example showed the creation of a new conference using
   default values.  This means the client provided no information about
   how she wanted the conference to be created.  The XCON framework (and
   CCMP as a consequence) allows for the implementation of templates.
   These templates are called "conference blueprints", and are basically
   conference objects with pre-defined settings.  This means that a
   client might get a list of blueprints, choose the one that more fits
   his needs, and use the chosen blueprint to create a new conference.

   This section Figure 5 provides an example of one client, "Alice",
   discovering the conference blueprints available for a particular
   conferencing system and creating a conference based on the desired

         Figure 5: Client Creation of Conference using Blueprints

   1.  Alice first sends a "blueprintsRequest" message to the
       conferencing system identified by the conference server discovery
       process.  This request contains the "confUserID" of the user
       issuing the request (Alice's XCON-USERID) and the "xpathFilter"
       parameter by which Alice specifies she desires to obtain only
       blueprints providing support for both audio and video: for this
       purpose, the xpath query contained in this field is: "/
       conference-info[conference-description/available-media/entry/
       type='audio' and conference-description/available-media/entry/
       type='video'"] .  Upon receipt of the "blueprintsRequest", the
       conferencing system would first ensure, on the basis of the
       "confUserID" parameter, that Alice has the appropriate authority
       based on system policies to receive the requested kind of
       blueprints supported by that system.

   2.  All blueprints that Alice is authorized to use are returned in a
       "blueprintsResponse" message in the "blueprintsInfo" element.

   3.  Upon receipt of the "blueprintsResponse" containing the
       blueprints, Alice determines which blueprint to use for the
       conference to be created.  Alice sends a "blueprintRequest"
       message to get the specific blueprint as identified by the
       "confObjID".

   4.  The conferencing system returns the "confInfo" associated with
       the specific blueprint as identified by the "confObjID" in the
       "blueprintResponse" message.

   5.  Alice finally sends a "confRequest" with a "create" operation to
       the conferencing system to create a conference reservation
       cloning the chosen blueprint.  This is achieved by writing the
       blueprint's XCON-URI in the "confObjID" parameter.

   6.  Upon receipt of the "confRequest" message with a "create"
       operation, the conferencing system uses the received blueprint to
       clone a conference, allocating a new XCON-URI (again called
       "confObjID*" in the example).  The conferencing server then sends
       a "confResponse" message including the new "confObjID*"
       associated with the newly created conference instance.  Upon
       receipt of the "confResponse" message, Alice can now add other
       users to the conference .

        Figure 6: Create Conference (Blueprint) Detailed Messaging

5.3.  Conference Creation using User-Provided Conference Information

   A conference can also be created by the client sending a
   "confRequest" message with the "create" operation, along with the
   desired data in the form of the "confInfo" parameter for the
   conference to be created.  The request also includes the "confUserID"
   of the requesting entity.

   This approach allows for a client (in this example Alice) to
   completely describe what the conference object should look like,
   without relying on defaults or blueprints: e.g, which media should be
   available, the topic, the users allowed to join, any scheduling-

Internet-Draft           CCMP Call Flow Examples            October 2010


   related information and so on.  This can be done by providing in the
   creation request a full conference object for the server to parse.

   This "confInfo" parameter must comply with the Data Model
   specification.  This means that the "entity" attribute is mandatory,
   and cannot be missing in the document.  However, in this example the
   client is actually requesting the creation of a new conference, which
   doesn't exist yet, so the "entity" attribute is unknown.  As
   discussed in Section 4.1, the CCMP protocol allows for the use of a
   wildcard placeholder.  This placeholder
   ("xcon:AUTO_GENERATE_1@example.com" in the example) is only to ensure
   the "confInfo" element is compliant with the Data Model, and would
   subsequently be replaced by the conferencing system with the actual
   value.  Thus, when the conferencing system actually creates the
   conference, a valid "entity" value is created for it as well, which
   takes the place of the wildcard value when the actual conference
   object provided by the client is populated.

   To give a flavour of what could be added to the conference object, we
   assume Alice is also interested in providing scheduling-related
   information.  So, in this example, Alice also specifies by the
   <conference-time> element included in the "confInfo" that the
   conference she wants to create has to occur on a certain date
   spanning from a certain start time to a certain stop time and has to
   be replicated weekly.

   Moreover, Alice indicates by means of the <allowed-users-list> that
   at the start time Bob, Carol and herself have to be called by the
   conferencing system to join the conference (in fact, for each
   <target> corresponding to one of the above-mentioned clients, the
   "method" attribute is set to "dial-out").

   Once Alice has prepared the "confInfo" element and sent it as part of
   her request to the server, if the conferencing system can support
   that specific type of conference (capabilities, etc.), then the
   request results in the creation of a conference.  We assume the
   request has been successful, and as a consequence XCON-URI in the
   form of the "confObjID" parameter and the XCON-USERID in the form of
   the "confUserID" parameter (again, the same as the requesting entity)
   are returned in the "confResponse" message.

   In this example, the created conference object is not returned in the
   successful "confResponse" in the "confInfo" parameter.  Nevertheless,
   Alice could still retrieve the actual conference object by issuing a
   "confRequest" with a "retrieve" operation on the returned
   "confObjID".  Such a request would show how, as described at the
   beginning of this section, the "entity" attribute of the conference
   object in "confInfo" is replaced with the actual information (i.e.

5.4.  Cloning an Existing Conference

   A client can also create another conference by cloning an existing
   conference, such as an active conference or conference reservation.
   This approach can be seen as a logical extension of the creation of a
   new conference using a blueprint: the difference is that, instead of
   cloning the pre-defined settings listed in a blueprint, the settings
   of an existing conference would be cloned.

Internet-Draft           CCMP Call Flow Examples            October 2010


   In this example, the client sends a "confRequest" message with the
   "create" operation, along with the "confUserID" and a specific
   "confObjID", from which a new conference is to be created by cloning
   an existing conference.

   An example of how a client can create a conference based on a
   blueprint is provided in Section 5.2.  The manner by which a client
   in this example might learn about a conference reservation or active
   conferences is similar to the first step in the blueprint example,
   with the exception of querying for different types of conference
   objects supported by the specific conferencing system.  For example,
   in this example, the client clones a conference reservation (i.e., an
   inactive conference).

   If the conferencing system can support a new instance of the specific
   type of conference (capabilities, etc.), then the request results in
   the creation of a conference, with an XCON-URI in the form of a new
   value in the "confObjID" parameter to reflect the newly cloned
   conference object returned in the "confResponse" message.

   1.  Alice, a conferencing system client, sends a confRequest message
       to clone a conference based on an existing conference
       reservation.  Alice indicates this conference should be cloned
       from the specified parent conference represented by the
       "confObjID" in the request.

   2.  Upon receipt of the confRequest message containing a "create"
       operation and "confObjID", the conferencing system ensures that
       the "confObjID" received is valid.  The conferencing system
       determines the appropriate read/write access of any users to be
       added to a conference based on this "confObjID" (using
       membership, roles, etc.).  The conferencing system uses the
       received "confObjID" to clone a conference reservation.  The
       conferencing system also reserves or allocates a new "confObjID"
       (called "confObjID*" in Figure 9) to be used for the cloned
       conference object.  This new identifier is of course different
       from the one associated with the conference to be cloned, since
       it represents a different conference object.  Any subsequent
       protocol requests from any of the members of the conference must
       use this new identifier.  The conferencing system maintains the
       mapping between this conference ID and the parent conference
       object ID associated with the reservation through the conference
       instance, and this mapping is explicitly addressed through the
       "cloning-parent" element of the "conference-description" in the
       new conference object.

6.  Conference Users Scenarios and Examples

   Section 5 showed examples describing the several different ways a
   conference might be created using CCMP.  This section focuses on
   user-related scenarios, i.e. typical scenarios that may occur during
   the lifetime of a conference, like adding new users and handling
   their media.  The following scenarios are based on those documented
   in the XCON framework.  The examples assume that a conference has
   already been correctly established, with media, if applicable, per
   one of the examples in Section 5.

6.1.  Adding a Party

   In this example, Alice wants to add Bob to an established conference.
   In the following example we assume Bob is a new user of the system,
   which means Alice also needs to provide some details about him.  In
   fact, the case of Bob already present as a user in the conferencing
   system is much easier to address, and will be discussed later on.

        Figure 11: Client Manipulation of Conference - Add a party

   1.  Alice sends a userRequest message with an operation of "create"
       to add Bob to the specific conference as identified by the
       "confObjID".  The "create" operation also makes sure that Bob is
       created as a user in the whole conferencing system.  This is done
       by adding in the request a "userInfo" element describing Bob as a
       user.  This is needed in order to let the conferencing system be
       aware of Bob's characteristics.  In case Bob was already a
       registered user, Alice would just have referenced him through his
       XCON-USERID in the "entity" attribute of the "userInfo" field,
       without providing additional data.  In fact, that data
       (including, for instance, Bob's SIP-URI to be used subsequently
       for dial-out) would be obtained by referencing the extant
       registration.  The conference server ensures that Alice has the

       appropriate authority based on the policies associated with that
       specific conference object to perform the operation.  As
       mentioned before, a new Conference User Identifier is created for
       Bob, and the "userInfo" is used to update the conference object
       accordingly.  As already seen in Section 5.3, a placeholder
       wildcard ("xcon-userid:AUTO_GENERATE@example.com" in the CCMP
       messages below) is used for the "entity" attribute of the
       "userInfo" element, to be replaced by the actual XCON-USERID
       later on;

   2.  Bob is successfully added to the conference object, and an XCON-
       USERID is allocated for him ("xcon-userid:Bob@example.com"); this
       identifier is reported in the response as part of the "entity"
       element of the returned "userInfo";

   3.  In the presented example, the call signaling to add Bob to the
       conference is instigated through the Focus as well.  As noted
       previously, this is implementation specific.  In fact, a
       conferencing system may accomplish different actions after the
       user creation, just as it may do nothing at all.  Among the
       possible actions, for instance, Bob may be added as a <target>
       element to the <allowed-users-list> element, whose joining
       "method" may be either "dial-in" or "dial-out".  Besides, out-of-
       band notification mechanisms may be involved as well, e.g. to
       notify Bob via mail of the new conference, including details as
       the date, password, expected participants and so on (see
       Section 4.3).

      Once Bob has been successfully added to the specified conference,
      per updates to the state, and depending upon the policies, other
      participants (including Bob himself) may be notified of the
      addition of Bob to the conference via the Conference Notification
      Service in use.

                   Figure 12: Add Party Message Details

6.2.  Muting a Party

   This section provides an example of the muting of a party in an
   active conference.  We assume that the user to mute has already been
   added to the conference.  The document only addresses muting and not
   unmuting, since the latter would involve an almost identical CCMP
   message flow anyway.  However, if any external floor control is
   involved, whether a particular conference client can actually mute/
   unmute itself, must be considered by the conferencing system.

      Please notice that interaction between CCMP and floor control
      should be carefully considered.  In fact, handling CCMP- and BFCP-
      based media control has to be considered as multiple layers: i.e.,
      a participant may have the BFCP floor granted, but be muted by
      means of CCMP.  If so, he would still be muted in the conference,
      and would only be unmuted if both the protocols allowed for this.

   Figure 13 provides an example of one client, "Alice", impacting the
   media state of another client, "Bob".  This example assumes an
   established conference.  In this example, Alice, whose role is
   "moderator" of the conference, wants to mute Bob on a medium-size
   multi-party conference, as his device is not muted (and he's
   obviously not listening to the call) and background noise in his
   office environment is disruptive to the conference.  BFCP floor
   control is assumed not to be involved.

   Muting can be accomplished using the "mute" control in the conference
   object, in which case the conference server must update the settings
   associated with the user's media streams.  Muting/unmuting can also
   be accomplished by directly updating the conference object with
   modified settings related to the target user's media streams, which
   is the approach shown in this example.  Specifically, Bob's
   "userInfo" is updated by modifying its audio <endpoint> information
   (e.g. setting it to "recvonly" in case of muting), identified by the
   right media id.

   1.  Alice sends a userRequest message with an "update" operation and
       the userInfo with the "status" field in the "media" element for
       Bob's <endpoint> set to "revconly".  In order to authenticate
       herself, Alice provides in the "subject" request parameter her
       registration credentials (i.e. username and password).  The
       "subject" parameter is an optional one: its use can be systematic
       whenever the conferencing server envisages to authenticate each
       requestor.  In such cases, if the client does not provide the
       required authentication information, the conferencing server
       answers with a CCMP "authenticationRequired" response message,
       indicating that the request cannot be processed without including
       the proper "subject" parameter.  The Conference Server ensures

       that Alice has the appropriate authority based on the policies
       associated with that specific conference object to perform the
       operation.  It recognizes that Alice is allowed to request the
       specified modification, since she is moderator of the target
       conference, and updates the "userInfo" in the conference object
       reflecting that Bob's media is not to be mixed with the
       conference media.  If the Conference Server relies on a remote
       Media Server for its multimedia functionality, it subsequently
       changes Bob's media profile accordingly by means of the related
       protocol interaction with the MS.  An example describing a
       possible way of dealing with such a situation using the Media
       Server Control architecture is described in
       [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-call-flows], at "Simple Bridging: Framework
       Transactions (2)".

   2.  A userResponse message with a "200" response-code ("success") is
       then sent to Alice.  Depending upon the policies, the conference
       server may notify other participants (including Bob) of this
       update via any Conference Notification Service that may be in
       use.

6.3.  Conference Announcements and Recordings

   This section deals with features that are typically required in a
   conferencing system, such as public announcements (e.g. to notify
   vocally that a new user joined a conference) and name recording.
   While this is not strictly CCMP-related (the CCMP signaling is
   actually the same as the one seen in Section 6.1) it is an
   interesting scenario to address to see how several components of an
   XCON-compliant architecture interact with each other to make it
   happen.

   In this example, as shown in Figure 15 Alice is joining Bob's
   conference that requires that she first enters a pass code.  After
   successfully entering the pass code, an announcement prompts Alice to
   speak her name so it can be recorded.  When Alice is added to the
   active conference, the recording is played back to all the existing
   participants.  A very similar example is presented in Figure 33 of
   [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-call-flows].

                  Figure 15: Recording and Announcements

   1.  Upon receipt of the userRequest from Alice to be added to Bob's
       conference, the conferencing system determines that a password is
       required for this specific conference.  Thus an announcement
       asking Alice to enter the password is sent back.  This may be
       achieved by means of typical IVR functionality.  Once Alice
       enters the password, it is validated against the policies
       associated with Bob's active conference.  The conferencing system
       then connects to a server which prompts and records Alice's name.
       The conferencing system must also determine whether Alice is
       already a user of this conferencing system or whether she is a
       new user.  In this case, Alice is a new user for this
       conferencing system, so a Conference User Identifier (i. e. an
       XCON-USERID) is created for Alice.  Based upon the contact
       information provided by Alice, the call signaling to add Alice to
       the conference is instigated through the Focus.

   2.  The conference server sends Alice a userResponse message which
       includes the "confUserID" assigned by the conferencing system to
       her.  This would allow Alice to later perform operations on the
       conference (if she were to have the appropriate policies),
       including registering for event notifications associated with the
       conference.  Once the call signaling indicates that Alice has
       been successfully added to the specific conference, per updates
       to the state, and depending upon the policies, other participants
       (e.g., Bob) are notified of the addition of Alice to the
       conference via the conference notification service and an
       announcement is provided to all the participants indicating that
       Alice has joined the conference.

                 Figure 16: Announcement Messaging Details

6.4.  Monitoring for DTMF

   Conferencing systems often also need the capability to monitor for
   DTMF from each individual participant.  This would typically be used
   to enter the identifier and/or access code for joining a specific
   conference.  This feature is often also exploited to achieve
   interaction between participants and the conference system for non-
   XCON-aware user agents (e.g. using DTMF tones to get muted/unmuted).

   An example of DTMF monitoring, within the context of the framework
   elements, is shown in Figure 15.  The mediactrl architecture/
   protocols can be used by the conferencing system for all the DTMF
   interactions.  Examples for DTMF interception in conference instances
   are presented in [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-call-flows].

6.5.  Entering a password-protected conference

   Some conferences may require a password to be provided by a user who
   wants to manipulate the conference objects (e.g. join, update,
   delete) via CCMP.  In this case, a password would be included in the
   <conference-password> element related to the conference XCON-URI in
   the appropriate <conference-uris> entry and must be then included in
   the "conference-password" field in the CCMP request addressed to a
   specific conference.

   In the following example, Alice, a conferencing system client,
   attempts to join a password-protected conference.

   1.  Alice sends a userRequest message with a "create" operation to
       add herself in the conference with XCON-URI
       "xcon:8977777@example.com" (written in the "confObjID"
       parameter).  Alice provides her XCON-USERID via the "confUserID"
       field of the userRequest and leaves out the "userInfo" one
       (first-party join).  In this first attempt, she doesn't insert
       any password parameter.

   2.  Upon receipt the userRequest/create message, the conferencing
       server detects that the indicated conference is not joinable
       without providing the appropriate pass code.  A userResponse
       message with "423" response-code ("conference password required")
       is returned to Alice to indicate that her join has been refused
       and that she has to resend her request including the appropriate
       conference password in order to participate.

   3.  After getting the pass code through out-of-band mechanisms, Alice
       provides it in the proper "password" request field of a new

       userRequest/create message and sends the updated request back to
       the server.

   4.  The conferencing server checks the provided password and then
       adds Alice to the protected conference.  After that, a
       userResponse with a "200" response-code ("success") is sent to
       Alice.

7.  Sidebars Scenarios and Examples

   While creating conferences and manipulating users and their media are
   sufficient for many scenarios, there may be cases when a more complex
   management is needed.

   In fact, a feature typically required in conferencing systems is the
   ability to create sidebars.  A sidebar is basically a child
   conference that usually includes a subset of the participants of the



Barnes, et al.           Expires April 28, 2011                [Page 46]

Internet-Draft           CCMP Call Flow Examples            October 2010


   parent conference, and a subset of its media as well.  Sidebars are
   typically required whenever some of the participants in a conference
   want a private discussion, without interfering with the main
   conference.

   This section deals with some typical scenarios using a sidebar, like
   whispering, private messages and coaching scenarios.  The first
   subsections present some examples of how a generic sidebar can be
   created, configured and managed.

7.1.  Internal Sidebar

   Figure 18 provides an example of one client, "Alice", involved in an
   active conference with "Bob" and "Carol".  Alice wants to create a
   sidebar to have a side discussion with Bob while still viewing the
   video associated with the main conference.  Alternatively, the audio
   from the main conference could be maintained at a reduced volume.
   Alice initiates the sidebar by sending a request to the conferencing
   system to create a conference reservation based upon the active
   conference object.  Alice and Bob would remain on the roster of the
   main conference, such that other participants could be aware of their
   participation in the main conference, while an internal-sidebar
   conference is occurring.  Besides, Bob decides that he is not
   interested in still receiving the conference audio in background (not
   even at a lower volume as Alice configured) and so modifies the
   sidebar in order to make that stream inactive for him.

            Figure 18: Client Creation of a Sidebar Conference

   1.  Upon receipt of CCMP sidebarByValRequest message to create a new
       sidebar-conference based upon the confObjID received in the
       request, the conferencing system uses the confObjID to clone a
       conference reservation for the sidebar.  The sidebar reservation
       is NOT independent of the active conference (i.e., parent).  The
       conferencing system also allocates a new XCON-URI for that
       sidebar to be used for any subsequent protocol requests from any

       of the members of the conference.  The new sidebar identifier
       ("confObjID*" in Figure 18) is returned in the response message
       confObjID parameter.

   2.  The relationship information is provided in the
       sidebarByValResponse message, specifically in the <sidebar-
       parent> element.  A dump of the complete representation of the
       main/parent conference is provided below as well to show how the
       cloning process for the creation of the sidebar could take place.

   3.  Upon receipt of the sidebarByValResponse message to reserve the
       conference, Alice can now create an active conference using that
       reservation, or create additional reservations based upon the
       existing reservations.  In this example, Alice wants only Bob to
       be involved in the sidebar, thus she manipulates the membership
       so that only the two of them appear in the <allowed-users-list>
       section.  Alice also wants both audio and video from the original
       conference to be available in the sidebar.  For what concerns the
       media belonging to the sidebar itself, Alice wants the audio to
       be restricted to the participants in the sidebar (that is, Bob
       and herself).  Additionally, Alice manipulates the media values
       to receive the audio from the main conference at a reduced
       volume, so that the communication between her and Bob isn't
       affected.  Alice sends a sidebarByValRequest message with an
       operation of "update" along with the "sidebarByValInfo"
       containing the aforementioned sidebar modifications.

   4.  Upon receipt of the sidebarByValRequest to update the sidebar
       reservation, the conference server ensures that Alice has the
       appropriate authority based on the policies associated with that
       specific conference object to perform the operation.  The
       conference server must also validate the updated information in
       the reservation, ensuring that a member like Bob is already a
       user of this conference server.  Once the data for the confObjID
       is updated, the conference server sends a sidebarByValResponse to
       Alice.  Depending upon the policies, the initiator of the request
       (i.e., Alice) and the participants in the sidebar (i.e., Bob) may
       be notified of his addition to the sidebar via the conference
       notification service.

   5.  At this point, Bob sends a userRequest message to the conference
       server with an operation of "update" to completely disable the
       background audio from the parent conference, since it prevents
       him from understanding what Alice says in the sidebar.

   6.  Notice that Bob's request only changes the media perspective for
       Bob. Alice keeps on receiving both the audio from Bob and the
       background from the parent conference.  This request may be

       relayed by the conference server to the Media Server handling the
       mixing, if present.  Upon completion of the change, the
       conference server sends a "userResponse" message to Bob.
       Depending upon the policies, the initiator of the request (i.e.,
       Bob) and the participants in the sidebar (i.e., Alice) may be
       notified of this change via the conference notification service.

   The following conference object represents the conference in which
   the sidebar is to be created.  It will be used by the conferencing
   system to create the new conference object associated with the
   sidebar.

   The sidebar creation happens through a cloning of the parent
   conference.  Once the sidebar is created, an "update" makes sure that
   the sidebar is customized as needed.  The following protocol dump
   makes the process clearer.

               Figure 20: Internal Sidebar Messaging Details

7.2.  External Sidebar

   Figure 21 provides an example of a different approach towards
   sidebar.  In this scenario, one client, "Alice", is involved in an
   active conference with "Bob", "Carol", "David" and "Ethel".  Alice
   gets an important text message via a whisper from Bob that a critical
   customer needs to talk to Alice, Bob and Ethel.  Alice creates a
   sidebar to have a side discussion with the customer "Fred" including
   the participants in the current conference with the exception of
   Carol and David, who remain in the active conference.  The difference
   from the previous scenario is that Fred is not part of the parent
   conference: this means that different policies might be involved,
   considering that Fred may access information coming from the parent
   conference, in case the sidebar was configured accordingly.  For this
   reason, in this scenario we assume that Alice disables all the media
   from the original (parent) conference within the sidebar.  This means
   that, while in the previous example Alice and Bob still heard the
   audio from the main conference in background, this time no background
   is made available.  Alice initiates the sidebar by sending a request
   to the conferencing system to create a conference reservation based
   upon the active conference object.  Alice, Bob and Ethel would remain
   on the roster of the main conference in a hold state.  Whether or not
   the hold state of these participants is visible to other participants
   depends upon the individual and local policy.  However, providing the
   hold state allows the participants in the main conference to see that
   others in the conference are busy.  Note, that a separate conference
   could have been created by Alice to allow Bob and Ethel to talk to

   Fred.  However, creating a sidebar has somewhat of an advantage by
   allowing the conference to be created using some of the same settings
   (e.g, role, floor control, etc.) that Bob and Ethel had in the main
   conference and it would allow for updates such that the media could
   be updated, for example, to provide audio from the main conference.

   1.  Upon receipt of the "sidebarByRefRequest" message to create a new
       sidebar conference, based upon the active conference specified by
       "confObjID" in the request, the conferencing system uses that
       active conference to clone a conference reservation for the
       sidebar.  The sidebar reservation is NOT independent of the
       active conference (i.e., parent).  The conferencing system, as
       before, allocates a conference ID (confObjID*) to be used for any
       subsequent protocol requests toward the sidebar reservation.  The
       mapping between the sidebar conference ID and the one associated
       with the main conference is mantained by the conferencing system
       and it is gathered from the c<sidebar-parent> element in the
       sidebar conference object.

   2.  Upon receipt of the "sidebarByRefResponse" message, which
       acknowledges the successful creation of the sidebar object, Alice
       decides that only Bob and Ethel, along with the new participant
       Fred are to be involved in the sidebar.  Thus she manipulates the
       membership accordingly.  Alice also sets the media in the
       "conference-info" such that the participants in the sidebar don't
       receive any media from the main conference.  All these settings
       are provided to the conferencing system by means of a new
       "sidebarByRefRequest" message, with an "update" operation.

   3.  Alice sends the aforementioned "sidebarByRefRequest" to update
       the information in the reservation and to create an active
       conference.  Upon receipt of the "sidebarByRefRequest" with an
       operation of "update", the conferencing system ensures that Alice
       has the appropriate authority based on the policies associated
       with that specific conference object to perform the operation.
       The conferencing system also validates the updated information in
       the reservation.  Since Fred is a new user for this conferencing
       system, a conference user identifier is created for Fred.
       Specifically, Fred is added to the conference by only providing
       his SIP URI.  Based upon the contact information provided for
       Fred by Alice, the call signaling to add Fred to the conference
       may be instigated through the Focus (e.g. if Fred had a "dial-
       out" method set as the target for him) at the actual activation
       of the sidebar.

   4.  The conference server sends a "sidebarByRefResponse" message and,
       depending upon the policies, the initiator of the request (i.e.,
       Alice) and the participants in the sidebar (i.e., Bob and Ethel)
       may be notified of his addition to the sidebar via the conference
       notification service.

               Figure 22: External Sidebar Messaging Details

7.3.  Private Messages

   The case of private messages can be handled as a sidebar with just
   two participants, similarly to the example in Section 7.1.  Unlike
   the previous example, rather than using audio within the sidebar,
   Alice could just add an additional text based media stream to the
   sidebar in order to convey her textual messages to Bob, while still
   viewing and listening to the main conference.

   In this scenario, Alice requests to the conferencing system the
   creation of a private chat room within the main conference context
   (presented in Figure 19) in which the involved partecipants are just
   Bob and herself.  This can be achieved through the following CCMP
   transaction (Figure 23).

Internet-Draft           CCMP Call Flow Examples            October 2010


   1.  Alice forwards a sidebarByValRequest/create to the Conferencing
       Control Server with the main conference XCON-URI in the
       "confObjID" parameter and the desired sidebar conference object
       in the "sidebarByValInfo" field.  In this way, a sidebar creation
       using user-provided conference information is requested to the
       conferencing system.  Please note that, unlike the previous
       sidebar examples, in this case a comnpletely new conference
       object to describe the sidebar is provided: there is no cloning
       involved, while the "confObjID" still enforces the parent-child
       relationship between the main conference and the to-be-created
       sidebar.

   2.  The Conference Control Server, after checking Alice's rights and
       validating the conference-object carried in the request, creates
       the required sidebar-by-val conference and a new XCON-URI for it.
       Instead of cloning the main conference object, as shown in
       Section 7.1 and Section 7.2, the sidebar is created on the basis
       of the user provided conference information.  However, the parent
       relationship between the main conference and the newly created
       sidebar is still mantained by the conferencing system (as a
       consequence of the chosen CCMP request message type - the
       sidebarByVal one) and it is reflected by the <sidebar-parent>
       element in the "sidebarByValInfo" element returned in the
       sidebarByValResponse message.  Please notice that, according to
       the CCMP specification, the return of the created sidebar data in
       this kind of "success" response is not mandatory.

             Figure 23: Sidebar for Private Messages scenario

7.4.  Observing and Coaching

   Observing and Coaching is one of the most interesting sidebars-
   related scenarios.  In fact, it highlights two different interactions
   that have to be properly coordinated.

   An example of observing and coaching is shown in figure Figure 25.
   In this example, call center agent Bob is involved in a conference
   with customer Carol.  Since Bob is a new agent and Alice sees that he
   has been on the call with Carol for longer than normal, she decides
   to observe the call and coach Bob as necessary.  Of course the
   conferencing system must make sure that the customer Carol is not
   aware of the presence of the coach Alice.  This makes the use of a
   sidebar necessary for the success of the scenario.

   Consider the following as the conference document associated with the
   video conference involving Bob (the call agent) and Carol (the
   customer) (Figure 24):

   1.  Upon receipt of the sidbarByRefRequest/create from Alice to
       "create" a new sidebar conference from the confObjID received in
       the request, the conferencing system uses the received active
       conference to clone a conference reservation for the sidebar.
       The conferencing system also allocates a conference ID to be used
       for any subsequent protocol requests from any of the members of
       the conference.  The conferencing system maintains the mapping
       between this conference ID and the confObjID associated with the
       sidebar reservation through the conference instance.  The
       conference server sends a sidebarByRefResponse message with the
       new confObjID and relevant sidebarByRefInfo.

   2.  Upon receipt of the sidebarByRefResponse message, Alice
       manipulates the data received in the sidebarByRefInfo in the
       response.  Alice wants only Bob to be involved in the sidebar,
       thus she updates the <allowed-users-list> to include only Bob and
       herself.  Alice also wants the audio to be received by herself
       and Bob from the original conference, but wants any outgoing
       audio from herself to be restricted to the participants in the
       sidebar, whereas Bob's outgoing audio should go to the main
       conference, so that both Alice and the customer Carol hear the
       same audio from Bob. Alice sends a sidebarByRefRequest message
       with an "update" operation including the updated sidebar
       information.

   3.  Upon receipt of the sidebarByRefRequest message with an "update"
       operation, the conferencing system ensures that Alice has the
       appropriate authority based on the policies associated with that
       specific conference object to perform the operation.  In order to
       request the insertion of a further media stream in the sidebar
       (i.e. in this example an audio stream from Alice to Bob), the
       requestor has to provide a new <entry> element in the <available-
       media> field of the "sidebarByRefInfo".  The mandatory "label"
       attribute of that new entry is filled with a dummy value
       "AUTO_GENERATE_1", but it will contain the real server-generated
       media stream identifier when the media stream is effectively
       allocated on the server side.  Similarly, the mandatory "id"
       attribute in <media> element referring to the new sidebar audio
       stream under both Alice's and Bob's <endpoint> contains a
       wildcard value, respectively "AUTO_GENERATED_2" and
       "AUTO_GENERATED_3": those values will be replaced with the
       appropriated server-generated identifiers upon the creation of
       the referred media stream.  We are assuming the conferencing
       control server is able to recognize those dummy values as place-
       holders.

   4.  After validating the data, the conference server sends a
       sidebarByRefResponse message.  Based upon the contact information

       provided for Bob by Alice, the call signaling to add Bob to the
       sidebar with the appropriate media characteristics is instigated
       through the Focus.  Bob is notified of his addition to the
       sidebar via the conference notification service, thus he is aware
       that Alice, the supervisor, is available for coaching him through
       this call.

8.  Removing Participants and Deleting Conferences

   The following scenarios detail the basic operations associated with
   removing participants from conferences and entirely deleting
   conferences.  The examples assume that a conference has already been
   correctly established, with media, if applicable, per one of the
   examples in Section 5.

8.1.  Removing a Party

   Figure 27 provides an example of a client, "Alice", removing another
   participant, "Bob", from a conference.  This example assumes an
   established conference with Alice, Bob, "Claire" and "Duck".  In this
   example, Alice wants to remove Bob from the conference so that the
   group can continue in the same conference without Bob's
   participation.

       Figure 27: Client Manipulation of Conference - Remove a party

   1.  Alice sends a userRequest message, with a "delete" operation.
       The conference server ensures that Alice has the appropriate
       authority based on the policies associated with that specific
       conference object to perform the operation.

   2.  Based upon the contact and media information in the conference
       object for Bob in the "userInfo" element, the conferencing system
       starts the process to remove Bob (e.g., the call signaling to
       remove Bob from the conference is instigated through the Focus).
       The conference server updates the data in the conference object,
       thus removing Bob from the <users> list.  After updating the

       data, the conference server sends a userResponse message to
       Alice.  Depending upon the policies, other participants (e.g.
       "Claire") may be notified of the removal of Bob from the
       conference via the Conference Notification Service.

                     Figure 29: Deleting a conference

   1.  The conferencing system client "Alice" sends a confRequest
       message with a "delete" operation to be performed on the
       conference identified by the XCON-URI carried in the "confObjID"
       parameter.  The conference server, on the basis of the
       "confUserID" included in the receipt request, ensures that Alice
       has the appropriate authority to fulfill the operation.

   2.  After validating Alice's rights, the conferencing server
       instigates the process to delete the conference object,
       disconnetting participants and removing associated resources such
       as mixer instances.  Then, the conference server returns a
       confResponse message to Alice with "200" as "response-code" and
       the deleted conference XCON-URI in the "confObjID" field.

   security considerations documented in the CCMP document.  Statements
   with regards to the necessary security are discussed in particular
   flows, however, this is for informational purposes only.  The
   implementor is encouraged to carefully consider the security
   requirements in the normative documents.


11.  Change Summary

   NOTE TO THE RFC-EDITOR: Please remove this section prior to
   publication as an RFC.

   The following are the major changes between the 02 and the 03
   versions of the draft:

   o  updated the call flows in order to take into account the changes
      on CCMP;


   o  added a completely new introductory section, addressing the
      protocol in general, the data model constraints, transport-related
      information, and notifications in a practical way;


   o  reorganized the chapters, grouping user-related scenarios in an
      users section, and doing the same for sidebars;


   o  added more verbose text to almost every section of the document;


   The following are the major changes between the 01 and the 02
   versions of the draft:

   o  updated the call flows in order to take into account the new
      versioning mechanism of the CCMP;


   o  clarified, per agreement in Stockholm, that cloning from a
      blueprint does not need a cloning-parent to be made available in
      the response;


   o  clarified that BFCP and CCMP-based media control are neither in
      conflict nor one the wrapper of the other; they act at different
      levels, and when both are involved, it is required that both grant
      a resource before it can be used by an interested participant;

   o  changed all the domains involved in the flows to make them
      compliant with [RFC2606];


   o  clarified that a successful creation of a new conference object
      may or may not contain the whole confInfo object in the response;
      in case it doesn't, a retrieve of the updated object can be
      achieved by issuing a confRequest/retrieve;


   o  clarified that the scenario in Section 6.3 only involves CCMP in
      adding the user to a conference; this includes requiring the use
      of a password only in adding the user to the conference object;
      the actual request for PIN/Password when joining thw conference is
      handled by means of out-of-band mechanisms (in this case at the
      media level, with the help of the MEDIACTRL framework);


   o  added and corrected Sidebars-related scenarios;


   o  added flows for some previously missing scenarios: Private
      Message/Whisper, Coaching Scenario, Removing a Party, Deleting a
      Conference;


   o


   The following are the major changes between the 00 and the 01
   versions of the draft:

   o  Updates to reflect change of CCMP to HTTP transport model.


   The following are the major changes between the individual 01 version
   to the WG 00:

   o  Updates to reflect most recent version of CCMP, including
      parameter names, etc.


   o  Added protocol details to many of the examples.


   o  Editorial: Simplifying intro, terms, etc.
