      <t>CloudAudit provides an open, extensible and secure interface
      that allows cloud computing providers to expose Audit, Assertion,
      Assessment, and Assurance (A6) information for cloud infrastructure
      (IaaS), platform (PaaS), and application (SaaS) services to authorized
      clients.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>CloudAudit provides a common interface, naming convention, set of processes 
	  and technologies utilizing the HTTP protocol to enable cloud service providers 
	  to automate the collection and assertion of operational, security, audit, assessment, 
	  and assurance information. This provides duly authorized and authenticated consumers 
	  and brokers of cloud computing services to automate requests for this data and metadata.</t>
	  
	  <t>CloudAudit supports the notion of requests for both structured and unstructured data 
	  and metadata aligned to compliance and audit frameworks. Specific compliance framework
	  definitions and namespaces ("compliance packs")) will be made available incrementally.</t>
	  
      <t>The first CloudAudit release is designed to be as simple as possible so as it can be
      implemented by creating a consistent namespace and directory structure and placement of
	  files to a standard web server that implements HTTP <xref target="RFC2616"></xref>.
      Subsequent releases may add the ability to write definitions and
      assertions, and to request new assertions be generated (e.g. a network
      scan). That is, while 1.x versions are read-only, subsequent releases
      may be read-write.</t>

      <t>A duly authorized and authenticated client will typically interrogate the service 
	  and verify compliance with local policy before making use of it. It may do so by checking
      certain pre-defined parameters (for example, the geographical location
      of the servers, compliance with prevailing security standards, etc.) or
      it may enumerate some/all of the information available and present it to
      an operator for a manual decision. This process may be fully automated,
      for example when searching for least cost services or for an alternative
      service for failover.</t>

      <t>As it is impossible to tell in advance what information will be of
      interest to clients and what service providers will be willing to
      expose, a safely extensible mechanism has been devised which allows any
      domain name owner to publish both definitions and assertions.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Notational Conventions">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, <xref
      target="RFC2119"></xref>, as scoped to those conformance targets.</t>

      <t>This document uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of
      <xref target="RFC2616"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Additionally, the following rules are included from <xref
      target="RFC3986"></xref>: URI.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="discovery" title="Discovery">
      <section title="Repository">
        <t>Clients SHOULD detect support for CloudAudit by verifying that a
        HTTP GET or HEAD for the repository root (e.g.
        /.well-known/cloudaudit) is successful (e.g. "200 OK"). Clients MAY
        also verify that requests for invalid URLs (e.g.
        /.well-known/&lt;random&gt;) return an error (e.g. "404 Not
        Found").</t>

        <t>If clients do not confirm the existence of a CloudAudit repository
        then they may be susceptible to false negatives (e.g. falsely assuming
        an assertion is absent when in fact the entire repository is absent)
        and if they do not confirm the absence of errors for invalid URLs then
        they may be susceptible to false positives (e.g. falsely assuming an
        assertion is present when in fact any assertion is present).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Links">
        <t>Servers MAY specify the root of a CloudAudit repository in the HTTP
        Link: header and/or HTML LINK element with
        rel="http://cloudaudit.org". This allows one or more services to
        delgate requests to a single local or remote/third-party server.
        Clients SHOULD check for the presence of these links before assuming
        that there is a local CloudAudit repository.</t>

          <artwork><![CDATA[<link rel="http://cloudaudit.org" href="http://example.com/.well-known/cloudaudit/com.example.ec2">]]></artwork>

          <artwork><![CDATA[Link: <http://example.com/.well-known/cloudaudit/com.example.ec2>; rel="http://cloudaudit.org"]]></artwork>
        </figure>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Enumeration">
      <t>Servers MAY render a HyperText Markup Language (HTML) response to a
      HTTP request for a directory containing an A or LINK element for every
      child with a HREF attribute containing the relative URL of the child.
      Clients MUST NOT rely on this functionality, which will vary from server
      to server.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Namespaces">
      <t>CloudAudit defines two namespaces; the glossary namespace which
      contains definitions and the service namespace which contains
      assertions. It relies on the Domain Name Service (DNS) to divide the
      glossary and service namespaces in an extensible fashion without relying
      on registries.</t>

      <t>A domain name (e.g. example.com) under the control of the party is
      broken into its components (e.g. example, com), reversed (e.g. com,
      example) and recombined (e.g. com.example). That party "owns" this
      namespace so long as the domain is registered to them and they may
      subdivide it with components in order to reference and/or categorise
      glossary definitions and service assertions. These MAY or MAY NOT
      represent valid hosts in the DNS.</t>

      <t>URI schemes and paths are NOT supported (e.g.
      https://example.com/cloud), however it is possible for a service to
      advertise an alternate name (e.g. cloud.example.com) via the HTTP Link
      header and/or HTML LINK element (<xref target="discovery"></xref>).</t>

      <section title="Glossary namespace">
        <t>The glossary allows clients to enumerate and/or resolve
        definitions, and to obtain additional documentation. Servers MUST
        provide a plain text representation and MAY provide alternative
        representations (such as HTML) via HTTP content negotiation.</t>

        <section title="Examples">
          <section title="Generic">
            <t>The following shows a client obtaining a definition for
            org.iso.3166-1.</t>

        <section title="Third-party Assertions">
          <t>It may be necessary for third-parties to make assertions, for
          example where an auditor certifies compliance with a given standard
          at a given time. This can be achieved either by retrieving a trusted
          representation (for example, an image containing a physical
          signature, or a digitally signed document) from the first-party or
          by being redirected to a third-party and retrieving the assertion
          directly from them.</t>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Digital Signatures">
      <t>Digital signatures allow clients to verify the integrity of the
      assertions (both first-party and third-party).</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The content of CloudAudit repositories MAY NOT be secure, private or
      integrity-guaranteed, and due caution should be exercised. Clients
      SHOULD use Transport Layer Security (TLS) <xref target="RFC5246"></xref>
      or equivalent to ensure confidentiality and integrity when accessing
      CloudAudit repositories over a public network such as the Internet.</t>

      <t>The Domain Name System (DNS) MAY be susceptible to attacks and care
      should be taken to authenticate servers, for example by verifying the
      chain of trust and infromation contained in SSL certificates provided,
      by using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) service, by relying on DNSSEC
      <xref target="RFC4033"></xref>, etc.</t>

      <t>Malicious clients MAY seek to obtain sensitive information via
      CloudAudit which could then be used to launch an attack. Such
      information should only be made available to authorised clients who have
      been authenticated via HTTP authentication <xref
      target="RFC2617"></xref> or equivalent.</t>

      <t>Servers may make false first-party assertions or may refer to
      third-party assertions that do not apply to them, or that expand the
      scope of the intended meaning. Clients that do not trust servers may
      choose only to rely on trusted third-party assertions, in which case the
      integrity of the assertion SHOULD be verified by transferring it over
      Transport Layer Security (TLS) <xref target="RFC5246"></xref> or
      equivalent or by verifying a digital signature applied to the assertion
      using OpenPGP <xref target="RFC4880"></xref> or equivalent</t>
