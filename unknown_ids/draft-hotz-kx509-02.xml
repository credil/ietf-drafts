    <abstract>
      <t>This rfc describes a protocol, called kx509, for using Kerberos
      tickets to acquire X.509 certificates.</t>

      <t>While not (previously) standardized, this protocol is already in use
      at several large organizations, and certificates issued with this
      protocol are recognized by the International Grid Trust Federation.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The two primary ways of providing cryptographically secure
      identification on the Internet are Kerberos tickets <xref
      target="RFC4120"></xref>, and X.509 <xref target="RFC5280"></xref> and
      <xref target="X.509"></xref> certificates.</t>

      <t>In practical IT infrastructure where both are in use, it's highly
      desirable to deploy their support in a way which guarantees they both
      authoritatively refer to the same entities. There is already a
      widely-adopted standard for using X.509 certificates to acquire
      corresponding Kerberos tickets called PKINIT <xref
      target="RFC4556"></xref>. This rfc describes the kx509 protocol for
      supporting the symmetric operation of acquiring X.509 certificates using
      Kerberos tickets.</t>

      <t>The International Grid Trust Federation <xref target="IGTF"></xref>
      supports the use of Short Lived Credential Services <xref
      target="SLCS"></xref> as a means to authenticate for resource usage
      based on other, native identity stores which an organization maintains.
      X.509 certificates issued using the KX590 protocol based on a Kerberos
      identity is one of the recognized Credential Services. The certificate
      profile for that use is outside the scope of this RFC, but is described
      in <xref target="GRID-prof"></xref>.</t>

      <t>In normal operation kx509 can be used after a Kerberos
      ticket-granting-ticket (TGT) is acquired, which is most likely during
      user login. First, the client generates a RSA public/private key-pair.
      Next, using the Kerberos ticket-granting-ticket, it acquires a Kerberos
      service ticket for the KCA (Kerberized Certificate Authority), and uses
      this to send the public half of its key-pair. The KCA will decrypt the
      service ticket, verify the integrity of the incoming packet, determine
      the identity of the user, and use the session key to send back a
      corresponding X.509 certificate.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Protocol Data">
      <t>The protocol consists of a single request/reply exchange using
      UDP.</t>

      <t>Both the request and the reply packet begin with four bytes of
      version ID information, followed by a DER encoded ASN.1 message. The
      first two bytes of the version ID are reserved. They MUST be set to zero
      when sent, and SHOULD be ignored when received. The third and fourth
      bytes are the major and minor version numbers. The version of the
      protocol described in this document is designated 2.0, so the first four
      bytes of the packet are 0, 0, 2, 0.</t>

      <t>Incompatible variations of this protocol MUST use a different major
      version number.</t>

      <section title="Request Packet">
        <t>The request consists of a version ID, a Kerberos AP_REQ, integrity
        check data on the request, and a public key generated by the client.
        The ASN.1 encoding is:</t>

        <t></t>

        <figure>
          <artwork type="ASN.1"><![CDATA[KX509Request ::= SEQUENCE {
        ap-req OCTET STRING,
        pk-hash OCTET STRING,
        pk-key OCTET STRING
}]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>The ap-req is as described in <xref target="RFC4120"></xref>
        Section 5.5.1.</t>

        <t>The pk-hash is HMAC using SHA-1 as the underlying hash. All 160
        bits are sent. The key used is the Kerberos session key. The data is
        the 4-byte version ID and the octet string for pk-key.</t>

        <t>The pk-key contains a public key. This key and its corresponding
        private key are generated by the client before contacting the server.
        Implementations of this protocol MUST support RSA keys, in which case
        the key is a DER encoded RSAPublicKey as defined in <xref
        target="RFC3447"></xref>, section A.1.1, and then stored in this octet
        string in the request. Use of other public-key types is not
        defined.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Reply Packet">
        <t>The reply consists of a version ID, an error code, and an optional
        authentication hash, optional certificate, and optional error text.
        The service SHOULD return replies of the same version as the request
        where possible.</t>

        <t></t>

        <figure>
          <artwork type="ASN.1"><![CDATA[KX509Response ::= SEQUENCE {
        error-code[0] INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
        hash[1] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL,
        certificate[2] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL,
        e-text[3] VisibleString OPTIONAL
}]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>Although the format of the reply contains independently optional
        objects, the server MUST only generate replies with one of the
        following allowed combinations.</t>

        <texttable>
          <ttcol></ttcol>

          <ttcol></ttcol>

          <c></c>

          <c></c>

          <c>e-text</c>
        </texttable>

        <t>The first case is returned when the server successfully generates a
        certificate for the user. The certificate is a DER encoded Certificate
        as defined in <xref target="RFC5280"></xref> Section A, page 116.</t>

        <t>The second case is returned when the server successfully
        authenticates the user and their key, but is unable for some other
        reason to generate a certificate.</t>

        <t>The third case MAY be returned if the server is unable to
        successfully authenticate the user and intends to return some
        unauthenticated information to the client.</t>

        <t>The hash on a response is computed using SHA-1 HMAC as for the
        request. The data that is hashed is the concatenation of the 4-byte
        version ID at the beginning of the packet, the error-code (if
        present), and all other optional fields which are present except the
        hash itself. In other words, the hash is computed on the fields which
        are present exclusive of the overall ASN.1 wrapping. The e-text MAY be
        translated into other character sets for display purposes, but the
        hash is computed on the e-text in its VisibleString
        representation.</t>

        <t>If the e-text contains NUL characters, the client MAY ignore any
        part of the error message after the first NUL character for display
        purposes.</t>

        <t>As implied by the above table, if the reply does not contain a
        certificate it MUST contain an error message and a non-zero error
        code. Conversely, if a certificate is returned then the error code
        MUST be zero. The server SHOULD NOT send a zero error-code. The client
        MUST treat a missing error-code as if it were zero.</t>

        <t>The defined error codes are as follows:</t>

        <texttable>
          <ttcol>error-code</ttcol>

          <ttcol>Condition</ttcol>

          <ttcol>Example</ttcol>

          <c>1</c>

          <c>Permanent problem with client request</c>

          <c>Incompatible version</c>

          <c>2</c>

          <c>Solvable problem with client request</c>

          <c>Expired Kerberos credentials</c>

          <c>3</c>

          <c>Temporary problem with client request</c>

          <c>Packet loss</c>

          <c>4</c>

          <c>Permanent problem with the server</c>

          <c>Internal misconfiguration</c>

          <c>5</c>

          <c>Temporary problem with the server</c>

          <c>Server overloaded</c>
        </texttable>

        <t>If a client error is returned, the client SHOULD NOT retry the
        request unless some remedial action is first taken. If error-code 3 is
        returned, the client MAY retry with other servers before giving
        up.</t>

        <t>If a server error is returned, it is RECOMMENDED that the client
        retry the request with a different server if one is known.</t>

        <t>Since all KCAs serving a Kerberos realm are intended to be
        equivalent, in accordance with <xref target="RFC5280"></xref> Section
        4.1.2.2, the certificates returned from different KCAs serving the
        same Kerberos realm MUST NOT contain duplicate serial numbers.</t>

        <t>The returned certificate MUST identify the Kerberos client
        principal from the ap-req in the original KX509Request in the subject
        of the cert, or in a subjectAltName extension. The identification MUST
        be unique within the organization's deployed infrastructure. It is
        RECOMMENDED that a subjectAltName extension be included of type
        id-pkinit-san as described in <xref target="RFC4556"></xref> Section
        3.2.2. Note that the id-pkinit-san is simply a standard representation
        of a Kerberos principal, and has no other implications with respect to
        PKINIT.</t>

        <t>Other extensions MAY be added according to local policy.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Protocol Operation">
      <t>Absent errors, the protocol consists of a single request, sent via
      UDP, and a single reply, also sent via UDP.</t>

      <t>There is no provision for requests or replies which exceed the
      allowable size of a UDP packet. Furthermore, if the request or reply
      exceeds the MTU size of a UDP packet for the infrastructure in use, then
      the reliability of the exchange will decrease significantly. For
      &ldquo;normal&rdquo; Kerberos ap-req structures, and
      &ldquo;normal&rdquo; X.509 certificates, this is unlikely unless the
      Kerberos service ticket contains large amounts of authorization data.
      For this reason, it is RECOMMENDED that service tickets for the KCA be
      issued without authorization data. If the KCA performs authorization, it
      should do so by other means.</t>

      <t>Before constructing the request, the client must know the canonical
      name(s) and port(s) of the server(s) to contact. It MAY determine them
      by looking up the service's SRV record as described in<xref
      target="RFC2782"></xref>. The entry to be used is _kca._udp.<spanx
      style="emph">realm</spanx>, where <spanx style="emph">realm</spanx> is
      the Kerberos realm, used as part of the DNS name.</t>

      <t>The client must then acquire a service ticket in order to construct
      the ap-req for the service. The Kerberos service principal name to use
      for this service has a first component of "kca_service". The second
      component and the realm of the principal follow normal Kerberos
      conventions.</t>

      <t>When the server receives a request, it MUST make sanity checks
      including at least the following:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The AP-REQ can be decoded and is not expired.</t>

          <t>If the request uses cross-realm authentication, then it satisfies
          the requirements of local policy and <xref target="RFC4120"></xref>
          Sections 1.2 and 2.7.</t>

          <t>The request's hash is valid.</t>
        </list>The server SHOULD make other sanity checks, such as a minimum
      public key length, to the extent feasible.</t>

      <t>The server MAY decline to respond to an erroneous request. If it does
      not receive a response a client MAY retry its request, but the client
      SHOULD wait at least one second before doing so.</t>

      <t>The client MUST verify any hash in the reply, and MUST NOT use any
      certificate in a reply whose hash does not verify. The client MAY
      display the e-text if the hash is absent or does not verify, but SHOULD
      indicate the message is not authenticated.</t>

    <section anchor="Acknowledgements" title="Acknowledgements">
      <t>The original version of kx509 was implemented using Kerberos 4 at the
      University of Michigan, and was nicely documented in <xref
      target="KX509"></xref>. Many thanks to them for their original work.</t>

      <t>While developing this document I received important corrections and
      comments from Jeffrey Altman, and Love Hornquist Astrand. I also
      received many helpful comments and corrections from Doug Engert, Jeffrey
      Hutzelman, Sam Hartman, and Timothy J. Miller. Alan Sill provided the
      references to the International Grid Trust Federation and its acceptable
      credential services. Example network traffic was provided by Doug
      Engert, Marcus Watts, and Matt Crawford from their deployments, and was
      extremely useful for verifying the reality of this specification.</t>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This service is conventionally run on UDP port 9878, but this memo
      does not request that IANA standardize the port number.</t>

      <t>IANA is requested to add "kca_service" as a GSSAPI/Kerberos/SASL
      service name for a "Kerberized Certificate Authority".</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The only encrypted information in the protocol is that used by
      Kerberos itself. The considerations for any Kerberized service apply
      here.</t>

      <t>The public key in the request is sent in the clear, and without any
      guarantees that the requestor actually possesses the corresponding
      private key. Therefore the only appropriate uses of the returned
      certificate are those where the subsequent use independently guarantees
      that the user possesses the private key. In particular the returned
      certificate MUST NOT be used for digital signatures unless the
      application's use is appropriately structured, or the identity of the
      signer is not important.</t>

      <t>Some information, such as the public key and certificate, is
      transmitted in the clear but (as the name implies) were generally
      intended to be publicly available. However their visibility could still
      raise privacy concerns. The hash is used to protect their integrity.</t>

      <t>The policies for issuing Kerberos tickets and X.509 certificates are
      usually expressed very differently. An implementation of this protocol
      should not provide a mechanism for bypassing ticket or certificate
      policies.</t>

      <t>In particular, if the issued certificate can be used with PKINIT,
      this authentication loop should not bypass policy limits for either
      X.509 certificates or Kerberos tickets. Since a PKINIT request must be
      signed and digitalSignature should not be an allowed usage for the
      issued certificate, this loop should not occur.</t>

      <t>X.509 certificates are usually issued with considerably longer
      validity times than Kerberos tickets. Care should be taken that the
      issued certificate is not valid for longer than the intended policy
      should allow. Note that<xref target="RFC4556"></xref> Section 3.2.3.1
      REQUIRES that the lifetime of an issued ticket not exceed the lifetime
      of the predecessor certificate. By analogy it is RECOMMENDED that the
      lifetime of an issued certificate not exceed the lifetime of the
      predecessor Kerberos ticket unless the implications with respect to
      local policy are clearly understood and allow it.</t>

             title="Certificate Cacheing and Deployment Considerations">
      <t>As noted in the Security Considerations section, the functional
      lifetime of the acquired X.509 certificate should usually match the
      lifetime of its predecessor Kerberos ticket. Therefore, it is likely
      that X.509 certificates issued with this protocol should be deleted when
      the supporting Kerberos tickets are deleted. That makes the Kerberos
      ticket cache a reasonable location to store the certificate (and its
      private key).</t>

      <t>On the other hand applications, such as web browsers, probably expect
      certificates in different stores.</t>

      <t>A widely used solution to this dichotomy is to implement a PKCS11
      library which supports the KX509-acquired credentials. The credentials
      remain stored in the kerberos credentials cache, but full PKI
      functionality is still available via a standard interface for PKI
      credentials.</t>

          <t>Should IANA registration of the service port be requested?</t>

          <t>Should timeouts be more fully specified? Any other issues with
          error-handling?</t>

          <t>Several people suggested more information be given on UDP size
          restrictions and their effect on reliability. Is the text in section
          3 sufficient?</t>

          <t>The original UMICH code has provisions for DSA private keys in
          addition to RSA. Nobody seems to use DSA. Everyone seems to use RSA.
          Is it worth specifying how DSA would work?</t>

      <t>Changes from the Previous Draft:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>The retry behavior was made slightly less specific.</t>

          <t>The traditionally used SAN extensions were moved to a new
          appendix, leaving only the id-pkinit-san as the RECOMMENDED SAN.</t>

          <t>The absolute prohibition against digital signatures in the
          Security Considerations section was relaxed since there are
          legitimate situations where a signature based on the KX509
          certificate is still useful. (E.g. integrity protection where the
          actual signing identity is not important.)</t>

          <t>Reference to TAGPMA in the abstract was replaced with a reference
          to its parent, the International Grid Trust Federation, and more
          detailed informative references were expanded in the
          Introduction.</t>

          <t>Assorted other wording changes were made for clarity, but are not
          believed to have changed the meaning.</t>
