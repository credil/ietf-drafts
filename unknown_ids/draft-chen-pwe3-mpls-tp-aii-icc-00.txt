     ITU Carrier Code (ICC) Attachment Individual Identifier (AII)
                 draft-chen-pwe3-mpls-tp-aii-icc-00.txt

Abstract

   This document defines a new Attachment Individual Identifier (AII)
   type which could be used when ITU Carrier Code (ICC) is used as the
   provider's globally unique identifier (Opr_ID).  The new AII (ICC
   AII) consists a ICC, a prefix and a AC ID field.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers] specifies two formats of Operator
   Identifier (Opr_ID), uniquely identifying an operator in Multi-
   Protocol Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) networks.  One
   format is compatible with IP operational practice called a Global_ID
   and anothor format compatible with ITU practice, the ITU Carrier Code
   (ICC).  The Opr_ID MAY use either the Global_ID or ICC format.

   [RFC4447] defines the signaling mechanisms for establishing point-to-
   point pseudowires (PWs) between two provider edge (PE) nodes.  It
   defines the format of the Generalized PWid FEC (FEC 129) and the use
   and semantics of the Attachment Group Identifier (AGI) and Attachment
   Individual Identifier (AII).  Two types of AII have been defined.
   AII Type 1 defined in [RFC6074] has a fixed-length 32-bit value that
   is unique within the scope of the local Provider Edge (PE).  AII Type
   2 defined in [RFC5003] consists a 4-octct length Global ID, a 32-bit
   prefix field and a 4-octet attachment circuit identifier (AC ID)
   field.  Existing AIIs do not support ICC based identifier.

   This document defines a new AII type (ICC AII).  It use a combination
   of a 6-octet length ICC, a 4-octet length prefix and a 4-octet length
   AC ID to create globally unique AII values.


2.  ICC AII

   ICC AII has the consistent structure with AII Type 2, which permits
   varying levels of AII summarization to take place, thus reducing the
   scaling burden on the AII distribution mechanisms and PE memory as
   decribed in RFC5003 [RFC5003].  The encoding of ICC AII is as
   follows:


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  AII Type=03  |    Length     |             ICC               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                             ICC (contd.)                      |

      |                             Prefix                            |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                             AC ID                             |

   Length: 1 octet in length, specifies the length of the value field in
   octets.  The length is set to 14.

   ICC: 6 octets in length.  As defined in M.1400, ICC is a string of
   one to six characters.  When the length of a ICC string is less than
   6, the higher-order unused octets of the ICC field MUST be set to
   zero.

   Prefix: Same as [RFC5003].

   AC ID field: Same as [RFC5003].

2.1.  Procedures

   Since the Opr_ID MAY use either the Global_ID or ICC format, the two
   ends of a PW may use the diffrent AII type.  During the Lable Mapping
   procedure, one end may not map the Target Attachment Identifier (TAI
   ) to one of its Forwarders.  In this case, it MUST send a Label
   Release message to the other end, with a Status Code of "Unassigned/
   Unrecognized TAI", and the processing of the Label Mapping message is
   complete.  In addition, for a specific PW, relevant PEs MUST use the
   same type of identifiers.


3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains a registry of "Attachment Individual Identifier (AII)
   Type".  This document request IANA to assign a new AII Type as
   follows:

   ICC AII: 0x03(TBD)


4.  Security Considerations

   This draft does not intrduce any new security issues, the security
   mechanisms defined in [RFC5003] apply here.
