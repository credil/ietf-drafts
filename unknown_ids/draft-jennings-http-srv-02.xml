      <t>This document specifies a new URI scheme called http+srv which uses a
      DNS SRV lookup to locate a HTTP server. The http+srv scheme operates in
      the same way as an http scheme but instead of the normal DNS lookup that
      a http scheme would use, it first tries an DNS SRV lookup. This memo
      also defines a https+srv scheme that operates in the same was as an
      https URI but uses DNS SRV lookups.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Web services often define APIs where software running on machine in a
      data center acts as an HTTP client and performs some http transactions
      to another HTTP server. For example, a portal such as Facebook can act
      as a http client and call specific HTTP-based APIs on other http
      servers. The reality of current networks is a large portion of the hosts
      have NATed addresses and often can not run on port 80. This is likely to
      become more common with the deployment of Carrier Grade NAT. DNS SRV
      records allow a DNS lookup of a name like www.example.com to provide
      both a port and the IP addresses of the HTTP server.</t>

      <t>This specification defines two new URI schemes, http+srv, and
      https+srv which are like http and https respectively. When a http client
      uses one of theses schemes to locate a web server, it starts by doing a
      DNS SRV record lookup and if one is found, uses that result. If no SRV
      record is found, it falls back to a DNS address (A or AAAA) record. The
      specification does not update or modify HTTP in any way.</t>

      <t>It is not expected that most web browsers would support these schemes
      for generic web use. It would instead be used for particular
      applications using HTTP such as specific web APIs. These APIs would be
      defined to require the use of this specification. In this situation, the
      end user's web browser might not do the SRV lookup when it browsed to
      the portal web pages, but the HTTP calls that the portal made out to
      other sites to generate the content would use this mechanism. As such
      architectures become more common, DNS SRV would allow many servers that
      are just providing an API to run on ports other than 80 even though main
      portal sites may still be running on the well known ports. Eventually,
      web browsers may end up supporting these SRV lookups, as the
      implementation is trivial and has very little downside.</t>

      <t>This technique is useful where users wish to run a web server behind
      a NAT but cannot control which port the NAT will allocate for the
      service. It is also useful where several users want to run different web
      servers on the same machine. A third use case for HTTP SRV is a
      situation in which all requests should be sent to a primary server, but
      if that server is down, then requests should fall back to an alternative
      server.</t>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Mechanisms">
      <t>Applications compliant with this specification MUST perform an SRV
      lookup as specified in <xref target="RFC2782"></xref> when resolving the
      host portion of a http+srv or https+srv URI. As defined in the IANA port
      numbers registry, the service names used are _http and _https
      respectively. As described in RFC 2782, if no SRV record is present, the
      resolution will fall back on using other DNS records that would be used
      by a http scheme as defined in HTTP<xref target="RFC2616"></xref>. The
      rest of the http+srv URI is processed in the same way as an http URI in
      RFC 2616 while the rest of a https+srv scheme URI is processed the same
      way as a https URI as defined in <xref target="RFC2818"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Example">
      <t>In the following example, the client will do a lookup on the URI,
      which finds the SRV record that then points at the A record that points
      at the IP address.</t>

      <figure anchor="fig-arch64">
        <artwork><![CDATA[
URI: https+srv://example.com
DNS SRV RR: _http._tcp.example.com. SRV   1 0 8080 host1.example.com.
DNS A RR:   host1.example.com.      A     192.0.2.88
]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>In this case the client would form a TCP connection to
      192.0.2.88:8080 then start TLS over that connection. Note that the
      certificate in the TLS handshake would be matched to example.com as that
      was the names used in the URI and it would not be matched to
      host1.example.com.</t>

            <t>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
            protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information
            systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used
            for many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers
            and distributed object management systems, through extension of
            its request methods, error codes and headers . A feature of HTTP
            is the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing
            systems to be built independently of the data being
            transferred.</t>

            <t>HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information
            initiative since 1990. This specification defines the protocol
            referred to as "HTTP/1.1", and is an update to RFC 2068 .</t>
