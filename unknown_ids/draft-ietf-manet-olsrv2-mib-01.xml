    <section title="Overview">
      <t>The Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol version 2 (OLSRv2) is a table driven, proactive routing protocol, i.e. it exchanges topology information with other routers in the network regularly. OLSRv2 is an optimization of the classical link state routing protocol. Its key concept is that of MultiPoint Relays (MPRs).  Each router selects a set of its neighbor routers (which "cover" all of its symmetrically connected 2-hop neighbor routers) as MPRs.  MPRs are then used to achieve both flooding reduction and topology reduction.</t>
      
      <t>This MIB document provides management and control capabilities of an OLSRv2 instance, allowing to monitor the state and performance of an OLSRV2 router, as well as to change settings of the deployment.</t>

      <section title="The State Group">
        <t>The State Subtree reports current state information.
          In OLSRv2, the state is stored in Information Bases. These are separately discussed below.</t>


        <t>The Local Information Base (LIB), contains a router's local configuration, as defined by NHDP. It is extended in the OLSRv2 specification to also record an originator address and to include a router's:</t>
           <t><list style='symbols'>
              <t>"Originator Set", which consists of Originator Tuples,
                 each of which contains addresses that were recently used as
      			 this router's originator address.</t>
              <t>"Local Attached Network Set", which consists of Local    	 	Attached Network Set Tuples, each of which contains addresses of networks to which this router can act as a gateway.</t>
           </list></t>

        <t>The Interface Information Based (IIB),
           recording information regarding
           links on each MANET interface and symmetric 2-hop neighbors which
           can be reached through such links. In addition to the uses in NHDP, information recorded in the Interface Information Bases is used for completing the Routing Set.

           The IIB contains two tables:</t>
           <t><list style='symbols'>
              <t>A "Link Set", which records links from other routers which are, or recently were, 1-hop neighbors.  It consists of Link Tuples, each representing a single link.</t>
              <t>A "Two-Hop Set", which records network addresses of symmetric 2-hop neighbors, and the symmetric links to symmetric 1-hop neighbors through which these symmetric 2-hop neighbors can be reached.  It consists of 2-Hop Tuples, each representing a single network address of a symmetric 2-hop neighbor, and a single MANET interface of a symmetric 1-hop neighbor</t>
           </list></t>

        <t>The Neighbor Information Base (NIB),
           records information regarding current
           and recently lost 1-hop neighbors of this router.
           The NIB contains two tables:</t>
           <t><list style='symbols'>
              <t>The "Neighbor Set", which records all network addresses of each 1-hop neighbor.  It consists of Neighbor Tuples, each representing a single 1-hop neighbor.</t>
              <t>The "Lost Neighbor Set", which records network addresses of routers which recently were symmetric 1-hop neighbors, but which are now advertised as lost.  It consists of Lost Neighbor Tuples, each representing a single such network address.</t>
           </list></t>
           
        <t>The Topology Information Base (TIB),
           records information used for the calculation
           of the Routing Set.
           The TIB contains five tables:</t>
           <t><list style='symbols'>
              <t>The "Advertising Remote Router Set", which records information   describing each remote router in the network that transmits TC   messages, allowing outdated TC messages to be recognized and   discarded.  It consists of Advertising Remote Router Tuples.</t>
              <t>The "Router Topology Set", which records topology information about the links between routers in the MANET, allowing a "backbone" graph of all routers to be constructed using a minimum distance algorithm.  It consists of Router Topology Tuples.</t>
              <t>The "Routable Address Topology Set", which records topology information about the routable addresses within the MANET, and via which routers they may be reached.  It consists of Routable Address Topology Tuples.</t>
              <t>The "Attached Network Set", which records information about networks (which may be outside the MANET) attached to other routers and their routable addresses.  It consists of Attached Network Tuples.</t>
              <t>The "Routing Set", which records the first hop along a selected path to each destination for which any such path is known.  It consists of Routing Tuples.</t>
           </list></t>
           
        <t>The Received Message Information Base (RMIB),
           records information regarding messages, that have
           been previously received, processed, or forwarded
           by this router.
           The RMIB contains three tables:</t>
           <t><list style='symbols'>
              <t>The "Received Set", which records the signatures of messages which have been received over that OLSRv2 interface.  Each consists of Received Tuples.</t>
              <t>The "Processed Set", which records signatures of messages which have been processed by the router.  It consists of Processed Tuples.</t>
              <t>The "Forwarded Set", which records signatures of  messages which have been forwarded by the router.  It consists of   Forwarded Tuples.</t>
           </list></t>

			The following objects examine the influence of HP_MAX_JITTER, HT_MAX_JITTER, TP_MAX_JITTER, and TT_MAX_JITTER on the average number of transmissions per time, the average number of messages per packet and the average waiting time of each message in the outgoing message queue of this router.
			
			Since every outgoing message is delayed by a random time between 0 and the maximum jitter value for the message type, several messages will stay in the queue until the first message is scheduled to be sent, at which time all messages in the queue are sent in a single packet. Thus, by increasing jitter, more messages will be included in a single packet, leading to less transmissions per time. The MIB objects allow to calculate -- for the history of already sent messages -- how much less (or more) transmissions would have been expected using the modified value of the maximum jitter times (HP_MAX_JITTER, HT_MAX_JITTER, TP_MAX_JITTER, or TT_MAX_JITTER respectively). In addition, it calculates the average number of messages per packet as well as the waiting time in the queue with the given maximum jitter values.

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <!--[TODO] Remember to consider security from the start. -->

      <t>[TODO] Each specification that defines one or more MIB modules MUST
      contain a section that discusses security considerations relevant to
      those modules. This section MUST be patterned after the latest approved
      template (available at http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-security.html).
      Remember that the objective is not to blindly copy text from the
      template, but rather to think and evaluate the risks/vulnerabilities and
      then state/document the result of this evaluation.</t>

      <t></t>

      <t>[TODO] if you have any read-write and/or read-create objects, please
      include the following boilerplate paragraph.</t>

      <t>There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
      with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such objects
      may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
      The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
      proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
      These are the tables and objects and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>[TODO] writable MIB objects that could be especially disruptive
          if abused MUST be explicitly listed by name and the associated
          security risks MUST be spelled out; RFC 2669 has a very good
          example.</t>

          <t>[TODO] list the writable tables and objects and state why they
          are sensitive.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>[TODO] else if there are no read-write objects in your MIB module,
      use the following boilerplate paragraph.</t>

      <t>There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
      a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. So, if this MIB
      module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder
      can alter or create any management objects of this MIB module via direct
      SNMP SET operations.</t>

      <t>[TODO] if you have any sensitive readable objects, please include the
      following boilerplate paragraph.</t>

      <t>Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
      MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
      vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to control
      even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even
      encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network
      via SNMP. These are the tables and objects and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability: <list style="symbols">
          <t>[TODO] you must explicitly list by name any readable objects that
          are sensitive or vulnerable and the associated security risks MUST
          be spelled out (for instance, if they might reveal customer
          information or violate personal privacy laws such as those of the
          European Union if exposed to unauthorized parties)</t>

          <t>[TODO] list the tables and objects and state why they are
          sensitive.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>[TODO] discuss what security the protocol used to carry the
      information should have. The following three boilerplate paragraphs
      should not be changed without very good reason. Changes will almost
      certainly require justification during IESG review.</t>

      <t>SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
      if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
      there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access
      and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB
      module.</t>

      <t>It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
      provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <xref target="RFC3410"></xref>,
      section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic
      mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).</t>

      <t>Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
      RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable
      cryptographic security. It is then a customer/operator responsibility to
      ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB
      module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to
      those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or
      SET (change/create/delete) them.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>[TODO] In order to comply with IESG policy as set forth in
      http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html, every Internet-Draft that is
      submitted to the IESG for publication MUST contain an IANA
      Considerations section. The requirements for this section vary depending
      what actions are required of the IANA. see RFC4181 section 3.5 for more
      information on writing an IANA clause for a MIB module document.</t>

      <t></t>

      <t>Option #2:</t>

      <t>Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
      requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and to
      record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry. When the assignment
      has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX" (here and in the
      MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove this note.</t>

      <t>Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, a draft document
      MUST use place holders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual numbers.
      See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done in a draft
      MIB module.</t>

      <t>Option #3:</t>

      <t>This memo includes no request to IANA.</t>

    <!-- References Section -->

    <!-- Section 4.7f of [RFC2223bis] specifies the requirements for the
   references sections.  In particular, there MUST be separate lists of
   normative and informative references, each in a separate section.
   The style SHOULD follow that of recently published RFCs.

   The standard MIB boilerplate available at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-boilerplate.html includes lists of
   normative and informative references that MUST appear in all IETF
   specifications that contain MIB modules.  If items from other MIB
   modules appear in an IMPORTS statement in the Definitions section,
   then the specifications containing those MIB modules MUST be included
   in the list of normative references.  When items are imported from an
   IANA-maintained MIB module the corresponding normative reference
   SHALL point to the on-line version of that MIB module.  It is the
   policy of the RFC Editor that all references must be cited in the
   text;  such citations MUST appear in the overview section where
   documents containing imported definitions (other those already
   mentioned in the MIB boilerplate) are required to be mentioned (cf.
   Section 3.2).

In general, each normative reference SHOULD point to the most recent
version of the specification in question.
