Internet-Draft              PD Exclude Option             September 2010


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines an optional mechanism and the related
   DHCPv6 option to allow exclusion of one specific prefix from a
   delegated prefix set when using DHCPv6-based prefix delegation.

   The prefix exclusion mechanism is targeted to deployments where
   DHCPv6-based prefix delegation is used but a single aggregatable
   route/refix has to represents one customer, instead of using one
   prefix for the link and another prefix for the customer network.  The
   mechanism defined in this specification allows requesting router to
   use a prefix out of delegated prefix set on its link through which it
   exchanges DHCPv6 messages with the delegating router.


2.  Requirements and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Prefix Delegation with Excluded Prefixes

3.1.  Problem Background

   DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (DHCPv6-PD) [RFC3633] has an explicit
   limitation described in Section 12.1 of [RFC3633] that a prefix
   delegated to a requesting router cannot be used by the delegating
   router.  This restriction implies that the delegating router will
   have two (non aggregatable) routes towards a customer, one for the
   link between the requesting router and the delegating router and one
   for the customer site behind the requesting router.  This approach
   works well with the unnumbered router model (i.e. routers on the link
   have no globally scoped prefixes).  Also the same approach applies to
   the case where the prefix assigned to the requesting router link
   through which it received DHCP messages does not in any way need to
   be associated to the delegated prefixes.

   There are architectures and link models, where a host (e.g. a mobile
   router, also acting as a requesting router) always has a single (/64)
   prefix configured on its uplink interface and the delegating router
   is also requesting router's first hop router.  Furthermore, it may be
   required that the prefix configured on the uplink interface has to be
   aggregatable with the delegated prefixes.  This introduces a problem
   how to use DHCPv6-PD together with stateless [RFC4862] or stateful
   [RFC3315] address autoconfiguration on a link, where the /64
   advertised on the link is also part of the prefix delegated (e.g /56)

   to the requesting router.

3.2.  Available Workarounds

   The problem described in Section 3.1 can be solved in a multiple of
   ways.  We list a number of possible solutions below that all allow a
   natural aggregation of the /64 prefix used on the link and the
   delegated prefix.  Some of them are possible without modifications to
   [RFC3633] protocol but require new functionality in the delegating
   router or have other constraints.

   1.  Delegating and requesting router agree that a specific prefix
       from a delegated prefix set can be configured and used on the
       link where both delegating and requesting router are attached to.
       Both delegating and requesting router have to understand new
       enhanced DHCPv6-PD functionality and/or DHCPv6 options to achieve
       the desired outcome.  This solution is described in Section 3.3.

   2.  A delegating router delegates only half of the prefix that was
       reserved for the requesting router.  A /64 of the other half is
       used for (point-to-point) link where the delegating and
       requesting router are attached to.  The other half of the
       reserved prefix get delegated to the requesting router.  This
       solution has an obvious issue of "wasting" prefixes.  One can
       argue that IPv6 has no issue of address shortage but solutions
       promoting greedy use of IPv6 prefixes should not advocated.  This
       solution is one possible fallback mechanism when the solution
       described in Section 3.3 is not available in the requesting
       router.

   3.  A delegating router delegates a prefix that was reserved for the
       requesting router in a sets of longer prefixes.  For example, if
       the reserved prefix is a /56 then it can be delegated as a set of
       /57, /58, /59, /60, /61, /62, /63 and one /64.  The last
       remaining /64 is the prefix assigned to the uplink of the
       requesting router.  The size of the DHCPv6 message may quickly
       become an issue when the delegating any reasonable sized prefix.
       This solution is one possible fallback mechanism when the
       solution described in Section 3.3 is not available in the
       requesting router.  However, it is possible that legacy
       requesting router implementations cannot handle multiple
       delegated prefixes and therefore the solution 2) is probably a
       safer choice for a fallback mechanism.

   4.  A requesting router requests a single /64 for each of its
       downstream interfaces and a delegating router aggregates these
       /64 prefixes into a larger allocation.  The size of the DHCPv6
       message may quickly become an issue when the delegating any

       reasonable sized prefix.  This solution is one possible fallback
       mechanism when the solution described in Section 3.3 is not
       available in the delegating router.  However, it is not granted
       that legacy requesting router implementations can handle multiple
       delegated prefixes and therefore the solution 2) is probably a
       safer choice for a fallback mechanism.

3.3.  Proposed Solution

   This specification defines a new DHCPv6 option, OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE
   (TBD1), that is used to exclude exactly one prefix from a delegated
   prefix defined in the OPTION_IAPREFIX.  The OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE MUST
   only be included in the OPTION_IAPREFIX IAprefix-options field.
   There can be zero or one OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option in one
   OPTION_IAPREFIX option.  The OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option allows prefix
   delegation where a requesting router is delegated a prefix (e.g. /56)
   and the delegating router uses one prefix (e.g. /64) on the link
   through which it exchanges DHCPv6 messages with the requesting router
   with a prefix out of the same delegated prefix set.

   A requesting router SHOULD include an OPTION_ORO option with the
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option code in a Solicit, Request, Renew, Rebind,
   Confirm or Information-request message to inform the delegating
   router about the support for the prefix delegation functionality
   defined in this specification.  A delegating router MAY include an
   OPTION_ORO option in a Reconfigure option to indicate which options
   the requesting router should request from the delegating router.

   The delegating router MAY include the unspecified address '::' in the
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE as an indication that the option was understood but
   there is no reason to exclude any prefix from the delegated prefix
   set.  Otherwise, the delegating router includes the prefix in the
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option that is excluded from the delegated prefix
   set.  The requesting router MUST NOT assign the excluded prefix to
   any of its downstream interfaces.

                           Prefix Exclude Option

   o  option-code: OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE (TBD1).

   o  option-len: 1 + length of prefix in octets.  Valid option-lens are
      between 1 and 17.

   o  prefix-len: The length of the excluded prefix in bits.  Valid
      prefix-lens are between 0 and 128.  Prefix length of 0 means the
      unspecified address '::'.

   o  IPv6-prefix: A variable length IPv6 prefix up to 128 bits.  The
      prefix MUST be zero padded to the next full octet boundary.
      Trailing zero octets of the prefix SHOULD NOT be encoded into the
      prefix field.  The unspecified address MUST NOT be encoded at all.

   The OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option MUST only be included in the
   OPTION_IAPREFIX IAprefix-options [RFC3633] field.  The
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option MUST be located before the possible Status
   Code option in the IAprefix-options field.

   Any prefix excluded from the delegated prefix MUST be contained in
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE options within the corresponding OPTION_IAPREFIX.

   The prefix included in the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option share the same
   preferred-lifetime and valid-lifetime as the delegated prefix in the
   'parent' OPTION_IAPREFIX option.

   The prefix in the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option MUST be part of the
   delegated prefix in the OPTION_IAPREFIX.  For example, if the
   requesting router has earlier been assigned a 2001:db8:dead:beef::/64
   prefix by the delegating router, and the delegated prefix in the
   OPTION_IAPREFIX is 2001:db8:dead:be00::/56, then the prefix in the
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option MUST be 2001:db8:dead:beef::/64.


5.  Delegating Router Solicitation

   The requesting router locates and selects a delegating router in the
   same way as described in Section 11 [RFC3633].  This specification
   only describes the additional steps required by the use of
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option.

5.1.  Requesting Router

   The requesting router may have an address configured on its uplink
   interface of other scope than link-local and in this case the problem
   described in Section 3.1 applies.  If the requesting router implement



Korhonen & Savolainen     Expires March 6, 2011                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft              PD Exclude Option             September 2010


   the solution described in Section 3.3 then the requesting router MUST
   include the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option code in the OPTION_ORO option in
   the Solicit message.

   If the requesting router does not implement the solution described in
   this specification (see Section 3.3, it might still be possible for
   the requesting router to utilize the workaround 4) described in
   Section 3.2 through configuration.  In this case the delegating
   router may still be able to delegate aggregated prefixes to the
   requesting router.

   Once receiving Advertisement message, the requesting router uses the
   prefix(es) received in OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE in addition to the
   advertised prefixes to choose the delegating router to respond to.
   If Advertisement message did not include OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option or
   the prefix in the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option contains an unspecified
   address '::', then the requesting router MUST fall back to normal
   [RFC3633] behavior.

      Editor's Note: is there actually deployment case when multiple
      delegating routers would respond?

5.2.  Delegating Router

   If the OPTION_ORO option in the Solicit message includes the
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option code, then the delegating router knows that
   the requesting router supports the solution defined in this
   specification.  If the Solicit message also contains an IA_PD option,
   the delegating router can delegate to the requesting router a prefix
   which includes the prefix already assigned to the requesting router's
   uplink interface.  The delegating router includes the prefix
   originally or to be assigned to the requesting router in the
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option within the OPTION_IAPREFIX IAprefix-option
   in the Advertise message.

   If the OPTION_ORO option in the Solicit message does not include the
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option code, then the delegating router MUST fall
   back to normal [RFC3633] behavior.  However, the delegating router
   could still delegate prefixes to the requesting router using
   workarounds 2), 3) or 4) described in Section 3.2.

   If the OPTION_ORO option in the Solicit message includes the
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option code but the delegating router does not
   support the solution described in this specification, them the
   delegating router acts as specified in [RFC3633].  The requesting
   router MUST in this case also fall back to normal [RFC3633] behavior.

6.  Requesting Router Initiated Prefix Delegation

   The procedures described in the following sections are aligned with
   Section 12 of [RFC3633].  In this specification we only describe the
   additional steps required by the use of OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option.

6.1.  Requesting Router

   The requesting router behavior regarding the use of the
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option is more or less identical to step described
   in Section 5.1.  The only difference really is different used DHCPv6
   messages.

   The requesting router uses a Release message to return the delegated
   prefix(es) to a delegating router.  The prefix(es) to be released
   MUST be included in the IA_PDs along with the excluded prefix
   included in the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option.  The requesting router MUST
   NOT use the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option to introduce additional excluded
   prefix in the Release message that it originally got a valid binding
   for.

   The requesting router must create sink routes for the delegated
   prefixes minus the excluded prefixes.  This may be done by creating
   sink routes for delegated prefixes and more specific routes for the
   excluded prefixes.

6.2.  Delegating Router

   The delegating router behavior regarding the use of the
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option is more or less identical to step described
   in Section 5.2.  The only difference really is DHCPv6 messages used
   to carry the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option.

   The delegating router may mark any prefix(es) in IA_PD Prefix options
   in a Release message from a requesting router as 'available'
   excluding the prefix included in the OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE options.  If
   the Release message contains 'new' excluded prefix in any
   OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option, the delegating router MUST send a Reply
   message with Status Code set to NoBinding for that IA_PD option.


7.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations in DHCPv6 are described in Section 23 of
   [RFC3315], and for DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation in Section 12 of
   [RFC3633].

   A malicious requesting router may unnecessarily fragment the

   delegating router prefix pools and cause additional load on the
   delegating router by defining excluded prefix(es).  The excluded
   prefix(es) may cause the delegating router to react to neighbor
   discovery messages other than just ignoring them.


8.  IANA Considerations

   A new DHCPv6 Option Code is reserved from DHCPv6 registry for DHCP
   Option Codes.

       OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE   is set to TBD1
